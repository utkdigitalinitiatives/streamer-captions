00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.430


2
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.300
The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.670
Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.700
The common praise it bears.

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.700
I shall report,

6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.030
For most it caught me, the celestial habits,

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.400
Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence

8
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.030
Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!

9
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.900
How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly

10
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.900
It was i' the offering!

11
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.130
But of all, the burst

12
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.630
And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,

13
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.570
Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.

14
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.870
That I was nothing.

15
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.070
If the event o' the journey

16
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.770
Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--

17
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.030
As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,

18
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.570
The time is worth the use on't.

19
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.870
Great Apollo turn all to the best!

20
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.970
These proclamations, so forcing faults upon Hermione,

21
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.070
I little like.

22
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.130
The violent carriage of it

23
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.700
Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,

24
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.670
Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,

25
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.730
Shall the contents discover, something rare

26
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.030
Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!

27
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.570
And gracious be the issue!

28
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.700
(hammering sound)

29
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.530
This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,

30
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.330
Even pushes 'gainst our heart:

31
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.630
the party tried , The daughter of a king, our wife,

32
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.570
and one of us too much beloved.

33
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.730
Let us be clear'd of being tyrannous,

34
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.530
since we so openly proceed in justice,

35
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.470
which shall have due course,

36
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.800
Even to the guilt or the purgation.

37
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.500
Produce the prisoner.

38
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.070
It is his highness' pleasure that the queen

39
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.700
Appear in person here in court. Silence!

40
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.730
Read the indictment.

41
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.030
Hermione, queen to the worthy Leontes, king of Sicilia,

42
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.800
thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason,

43
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.530
in committing adultery with Polixenes,

44
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.000
king of Bohemia,

45
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.900
and conspiring with Camillo

46
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.370
to take away the life of our sovereign

47
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.930
lord the king, thy royal husband:

48
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.200
the pretence whereof being

49
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.630
by circumstances partly laid open,

50
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.100
thou, Hermione,

51
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.070
contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject,

52
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.470
didst counsel and aid them, for their better safety,

53
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.230
to fly away by night.

54
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.970
Since what I am to say must be but that

55
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.530
Which contradicts my accusation

56
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.570
and the testimony on my part no other

57
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.470
But what comes from myself,

58
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.570
it shall scarce boot me

59
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.500
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity

60
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.170
Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,

61
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.070
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine

62
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.130
Behold our human actions, as they do,

63
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.370
I doubt not then but innocence shall make

64
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.600
False accusation blush and tyranny

65
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.730
Tremble at patience.

66
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.600
You, my lord, best know,

67
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.370
Who least will seem to do so, my past life

68
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.530
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,

69
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.630
As I am now unhappy;

70
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.670
which is more than history can pattern,

71
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.330
though devised and play'd to take spectators.

72
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.770
For behold me a fellow of the royal bed, which owe

73
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.900
A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,

74
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.370
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing

75
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.770
To prate and talk for life and honour

76
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.530
'fore who please to come and hear.

77
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.100
For life, I prize it as I weigh grief,

78
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.600
which I would spare:

79
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.030
for honour,

80
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.200
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,

81
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.300
And only that I stand for.

82
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.400
I appeal to your own conscience, sir,

83
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.570
before Polixenes came to your court,

84
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.830
how I was in your grace,

85
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.870
How merited to be so;

86
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.770
since he came,

87
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.900
With what encounter so uncurrent

88
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.500
I have strain'd to appear thus:

89
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.830
if one jot beyond the bound of honour,

90
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.530
or in act or will

91
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.870
That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts

92
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.970
Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin

93
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.930
Cry fie upon my grave!

94
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:05.970
I ne'er heard yet

95
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.670
That any of these bolder vices wanted

96
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.130
Less impudence to gainsay what they did

97
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.900
Than to perform it first.

98
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.600
That's true enough;

99
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.700
Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.

100
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.500
You will not own it.

101
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.900
More than mistress of

102
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.900
Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not

103
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.630
At all acknowledge.

104
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.630
For Polixenes,

105
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.470
With whom I am accused, I do confess

106
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.230
I loved him as in honour he required,

107
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.900
With such a kind of love as might become

108
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.330
A lady like me, with a love even such,

109
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.830
So and no other, as yourself commanded:

110
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.770
Which not to have done I think had been in me

111
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.900
Both disobedience and ingratitude

112
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.500
To you and toward your friend,

113
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.630
whose love had spoke,

114
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.300
Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely

115
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.300
That it was yours.

116
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.700
Now, for conspiracy,

117
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.230
I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd

118
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.330
For me to try how: all I know of it

119
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.000
Is that Camillo was an honest man;

120
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.370
And why he left your court, the gods themselves,

121
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.970
Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.

122
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.800
You knew of his departure, as you know

123
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.300
What you have underta'en to do in's absence.

124
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.300
Sir,

125
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.930
You speak a language that I understand not:

126
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.730
My life stands in the level of your dreams,

127
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.870
Which I'll lay down.

128
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.100
Your actions are my dreams;

129
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.930
You had a bastard by Polixenes,

130
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.270
And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--

131
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.200
Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:

132
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.100
Which to deny concerns more than avails;

133
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.330
for as thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,

134
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.370
No father owning it,--which is, indeed,

135
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.670
More criminal in thee than it,

136
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.470
so thou Shalt feel our justice,

137
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.970
in whose easiest passage, look for no less than death.

138
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:09.330
Sir, spare your threats

139
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.330
The bug which you would fright me with I seek.

140
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.970
To me can life be no commodity:

141
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.530
The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,

142
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.930
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,

143
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.500
But know not how it went.

144
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.500
My second joy and first-fruits of my body,

145
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.330
from his presence

146
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.070
I am barr'd, like one infectious.

147
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.170
My third comfort starr'd most unluckily,

148
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.700
is from my breast,

149
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.000
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,

150
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.730
Haled out to murder:

151
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.900
myself on every post

152
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.330
Proclaimed a strumpet:

153
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.070
with immodest hatred the child-bed privilege denied,

154
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:53.030
which 'longs to women of all fashion;

155
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.570
lastly, hurried here to this place, i' the open air,

156
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.600
before I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,

157
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.330
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,

158
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.100
That I should fear to die?

159
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.400
Therefore proceed.

160
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:16.300
But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,

161
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.500
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,

162
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.530
Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd

163
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.200
Upon surmises,

164
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.800
all proofs sleeping else but what your jealousies awake,

165
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.100
I tell you 'Tis rigor and not law.

166
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:33.800
Your honours all,

167
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.570
I do refer me to the oracle:

168
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.430
Apollo be my judge!

169
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:40.400
This your request

170
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.430
Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,

171
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:45.670
And in Apollos name, his oracle.

172
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.970
The Emperor of Russia was my father:

173
00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.600
O that he were alive,

174
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.630
and here beholding his daughter's trial!

175
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.770
that he did but see the flatness of my misery,

176
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.430
yet with eyes of pity, not revenge!

177
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.100
You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,

178
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.330
That you, Cleomenes and Dion,

179
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.100
have been both at Delphos,

180
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.370
and from thence have brought the seal'd-up oracle,

181
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.930
by the hand deliver'd of great Apollo's priest;

182
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:37.900
and that, since then,

183
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.900
You have not dared to break the holy seal

184
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.870
Nor read the secrets in't.

185
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.000
All this we swear.

186
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.900
Break off the seals, and read!

187
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.800
Hermione is chaste;

188
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.430
Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject;

189
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.230
Leontes a jealous tyrant;

190
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.430
his innocent babe truly begotten;

191
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.700
and the king shall live without an heir,

192
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.430
if that which is lost be not found.

193
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.570
Now blessed be the great Apollo!

194
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.100
Praised!

195
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.670
Hast thou read truth?

196
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.130
Ay, my lord;

197
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.530
even so as it is here set down.

198
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.730
There is no truth at all i' the oracle:

199
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.030
The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.

200
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.900
My lord the king, the king!

201
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.030
What is the business?

202
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.070
O sir, I shall be hated to report it!

203
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.130
The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear

204
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.470
Of the queen's speed, is gone.

205
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.200
How! gone!

206
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.700
Is dead.

207
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.830
Apollo's angry;

208
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:58.670
and the heavens themselves do strike at my injustice.

209
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.600
How now there!

210
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.170
This news is mortal to the queen:

211
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.800
look down and see what death is doing.

212
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.970
Take her hence:

213
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:26.500
Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:

214
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.130
I have too much believed mine own suspicion:

215
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:36.830
Beseech you,

216
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.270
tenderly apply to her some remedies for life.

217
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.830
Apollo, pardon my great profaneness

218
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.970
gainst thine oracle!

219
00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.600
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,

220
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.570
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,

221
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.470
Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;

222
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.000
For, being transported by my jealousies

223
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.930
To bloody thoughts and to revenge,

224
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.770
I chose Camillo for the minister to poison

225
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.800
My friend Polixenes: which had been done,

226
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.700
But that the good mind of Camillo

227
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.400
tardied my swift command,

228
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.800
though I with death and with reward

229
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.470
did threaten and encourage him,

230
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.400
Not doing 't and being done:

231
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.570
he, most humane and fill'd with honour,

232
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.130
to my kingly guest Unclasp'd my practise,

233
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.370
quit his fortunes here,

234
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.370
Which you knew great, and to the hazard

235
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.100
Of all encertainties himself commended,

236
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.370
No richer than his honour:

237
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.800
how he glisters thorough my rust!

238
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.700
and how his pity does my deeds make the blacker!

239
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.230
Woe the while!

240
00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:01.230
O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,

241
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.600
Break too.

242
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.570
What fit is this, good lady?

243
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.800
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?

244
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.170
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?

245
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.170
In leads or oils?

246
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.070
what old or newer torture m ust I receive,

247
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.530
whose every word deserves to taste of thy most worst?

248
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.130
Thy tyranny together working with thy jealousies,

249
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.000
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle

250
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.800
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done

251
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.000
And then run mad indeed, stark mad!

252
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.200
for all thy by-gone fooleries

253
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.730
were but spices of it.

254
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.970
That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;

255
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.000
That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant

256
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.530
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,

257
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.600
Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,

258
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.670
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,

259
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.730
More monstrous standing by: whereof

260
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.900
I reckon the casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter

261
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.330
To be or none or little; though a devil

262
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.000
Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:

263
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.400
Nor is't directly laid to thee,

264
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.930
the death of the young prince,

265
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:58.130
whose honourable thoughts,

266
00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.170
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart

267
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.900
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire

268
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.300
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,

269
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.630
Laid to thy answer: but the last,

270
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.670
--O lords, When I have said,

271
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:22.230
cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,

272
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:26.630
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,

273
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:30.300
and vengeance for't not dropp'd down yet.

274
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.030
The higher powers forbid!

275
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.370
I say she's dead; I'll swear't.

276
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.630
If word nor oath prevail not, go and see:

277
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.200
if you can bring tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,

278
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.070
Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you

279
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:45.400
As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!

280
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.500
Do not repent these things, for they are heavier

281
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.170
Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee

282
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.900
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees

283
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.630
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,

284
00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.670
Upon a barren mountain and still winter

285
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.000
In storm perpetual, could not move the gods

286
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.670
To look that way thou wert.

287
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.630
Go on, go on

288
00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:13.870
Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved

289
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.400
All tongues to talk their bitterest.

290
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.270
Say no more:

291
00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.670
Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault

292
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.770
I' the boldness of your speech.

293
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.770
I am sorry for't:

294
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.630
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,

295
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:34.100
I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much

296
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.170
The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd

297
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.000
To the noble heart.

298
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.130
What's gone and what's past help

299
00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:50.970
Should be past grief: do not receive affliction

300
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.500
At my petition; I beseech you, rather

301
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.100
Let me be punish'd, that have minded you

302
00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.570
Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege

303
00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:03.000
Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:

304
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.270
The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--

305
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:13.000
I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;

306
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.200
I'll not remember you of my own lord,

307
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.470
Who is lost too: take your patience to you,

308
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.230
And I'll say nothing.

309
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.870
Thou didst speak but well when most the truth;

310
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:34.870
which I receive much better Tthan to be pitied of thee.

311
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.600
Prithee, bring me to the dead bodies of my queen and son:

312
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.200
One grave shall be for both:

313
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.670
upon them shall the causes of their death appear,

314
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.770
unto our shame perpetual.

315
00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.800
Once a day I'll visit the chapel where they lie,

316
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.070
and tears shed there shall be my recreation:

317
00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:00.630
so long as nature will bear up with this exercise,

318
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:05.000
so long I daily vow to use it.

319
00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:19.800
Come and lead me unto these sorrows.

320
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.130
Thou art perfect then,

321
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.930
our ship hath touch'd upon the deserts of Bohemia?

322
00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.270
Ay, my lord: and fear

323
00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.200
We have landed in ill time:

324
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.500
the skies look grimly and threaten present blusters.

325
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.000
In my conscience,

326
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.030
The heavens with that we have in hand are angry

327
00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.230
And frown upon 's.

328
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.630
Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;

329
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:12.570
Look to thy bark:

330
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.130
I'll not be long before I call upon thee.

331
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:14.930
Make your best haste,

332
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.730
and go not too far i' the land:

333
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.030
'tis like to be loud weather;

334
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.830
Besides, this place is famous for the creatures

335
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.730
Of prey that keep upon't.

336
00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:22.670
Go thou away:

337
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.700
I'll follow instantly.

338
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.770
I am glad at heart

339
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.900
To be so rid o' the business.

340
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.330
Come, poor babe:

341
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:08.030
I have heard, but not believed,

342
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:11.900
the spirits o' the dead may walk again:

343
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.670
if such thing be,

344
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:16.400
thy mother appear'd to me last night,

345
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:21.070
for ne'er was dream so like a waking.

346
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.830
To me comes a creature,

347
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:26.800
Sometimes her head on one side, some another;

348
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.500
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,

349
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:34.100
So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,

350
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.170
Like very sanctity,

351
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.100
she did approach my cabin where I lay;

352
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.900
thrice bow'd before me,

353
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.670
And gasping to begin some speech,

354
00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:48.130
her eyes became two spouts: the fury spent,

355
00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:52.330
anon did this break-from her:

356
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.370
'Good Antigonus,

357
00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:58.230
Since fate, against thy better disposition,

358
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.370
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out

359
00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:04.200
Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,

360
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.230
Places remote enough are in Bohemia,

361
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:12.400
There weep and leave it crying;

362
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.500
and, for the babe os counted lost for ever,

363
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.270
Perdita, I prithee, call't.

364
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:26.670
For this ungentle business put on thee by my lord,

365
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:30.530
thou ne'er shalt see thy wife Paulina more.'

366
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:39.670
And so, with shrieks she melted into air.

367
00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:43.970
Affrighted much, I did in time collect myself

368
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:49.000
and thought this was so and no slumber.

369
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.070
Dreams are toys:

370
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:56.700
Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,

371
00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.770
I will be squared by this.

372
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.830
I do believe Hermione hath suffer'd death,

373
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:07.030
and that Apollo would, this being indeed

374
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.970
the issue of King Polixenes,

375
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:11.400
it should here be laid,

376
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.330
Either for life or death, upon the earth

377
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:24.100
Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!

378
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:39.130
There lie, and there thy character: there these;

379
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:44.070
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,

380
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:47.830
And still rest thine.

381
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:51.470
The storm begins; poor wretch,

382
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:54.000
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed

383
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.300
To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,

384
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.400
But my heart bleeds;

385
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.670
and most accursed am I to be by oath enjoin'd to this.

386
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:08.800
Farewell!

387
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.400
The day frowns more and more:

388
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.570
thou'rt like to have a lullaby too rough:

389
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:26.400
I never saw the heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!

390
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.800
Well may I get aboard!

391
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.470
This is the chase:

392
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.400
I am gone for ever.

393
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.730
I would there were no age

394
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:04.530
between ten and three-and-twenty,

395
00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.370
or that youth would sleep out the rest;

396
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:08.900
for there is nothing in the between

397
00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.370
but getting wenches with child,

398
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.130
wronging the ancientry,

399
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:17.830
stealing, fighting--Hark you now!

400
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:21.000
Would any but these boiled brains of nineteen

401
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.300
and two-and-twenty hunt this weather?

402
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.800
They have scared away two of my best sheep,

403
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.300
which I fear the wolf will sooner find than the master:

404
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.800
if any where I have them,

405
00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:39.100
'tis by the seaside, browsing of ivy.

406
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:46.030
Good luck, an't be thy will what have we here!

407
00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:57.030
Mercy on 's, a barne a very pretty barne!

408
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:03.300
A boy or a child, I wonder?

409
00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:13.700
A pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:

410
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.530
though I am not bookish, yet I can read

411
00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:18.570
waiting-gentlewoma an in the 'scape.

412
00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:22.500
This has been some stair-work, some trunk-work,

413
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.170
some behind-door-work:

414
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:31.930
they were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here.

415
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:35.330
I'll take it up for pity:

416
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.470
yet I'll tarry till my son come;

417
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:40.830
he hallooed but even now.

418
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.930
Hilloa, loa!

419
00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:44.870
What, art so near?

420
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.430
If thou'lt see a thing to talk on

421
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.700
when thou art dead and rotten, come hither.

422
00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.800
What ailest thou, man?

423
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.400
I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!

424
00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.800
but I am not to say it is a sea,

425
00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.730
for it is now the sky:

426
00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:01.900
betwixt the firmament

427
00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.230
and it you cannot thrust a bodkin's point.

428
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:04.430
Why, boy, how is it?

429
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.900
I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,

430
00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.600
how it takes up the shore! but that's not the point.

431
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.600
O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!

432
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.630
sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em;

433
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.770
now the ship boring the moon with her main-mast,

434
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.070
and anon swallowed with yest and froth,

435
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.630
as you'ld thrust a cork into a hogshead.

436
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.100
And then for the land-service,

437
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.500
to see how the bear tore out his shoulder-bone;

438
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.830
how he cried to me for help

439
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:27.300
and said his name was Antigonus, a nobleman.

440
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.430
But to make an end of the ship,

441
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:30.370
to see how the sea flap-dragoned it:

442
00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:31.930
but, first, how the poor souls roared,

443
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:32.830
and the sea mocked them;

444
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.230
and how the poor gentleman roared

445
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.500
and the bear mocked him,

446
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.330
both roaring louder than the sea or weather.

447
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.370
Name of mercy, when was this, boy?

448
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:41.500
Now, now:

449
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.800
I have not winked since I saw these sights:

450
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.600
the men are not yet cold under water,

451
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.900
nor the bear half dined on the gentleman:

452
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.530
he's at it now.

453
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.700
Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!

454
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.000
I would you had been by the ship side,

455
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.130
to have helped her:

456
00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.070
there your charity would have lacked footing.

457
00:25:56.070 --> 00:26:00.670
Heavy matters! heavy matters!

458
00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:02.030
but look thee here, boy.

459
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:05.630
Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things dying,

460
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:11.130
I with things newborn. Here's a sight for thee;

461
00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:16.430
look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's child!

462
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:23.900
look thee here; take up, take up, boy;

463
00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.600
open't. So, let's see:

464
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.030
it was told me I should be rich by the fairies.

465
00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:35.030
This is some changeling: open't. What's within, boy?

466
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.130
You're a made old man:

467
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:42.900
if the sins of your youth are forgiven you,

468
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.900
you're well to live.

469
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:50.730
Gold! all gold!

470
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:55.700
This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so:

471
00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:00.200
up with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.

472
00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.230
We are lucky, boy;

473
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:06.330
and to be so still requires nothing but secrecy.

474
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:09.200
Let my sheep go: come, good boy,

475
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.930
the next way home.

476
00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.800
Go you the next way with your findings.

477
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.130
I'll go see if the bear be gone from the gentleman

478
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:19.030
and how much he hath eaten: they are never curst

479
00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.200
but when they are hungry:

480
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.570
if there be any of him left,

481
00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:23.470
I'll bury it.

482
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:25.170
That's a good deed.

483
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.930
If thou mayest discern by that which is left of him

484
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:29.970
what he is,

485
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.830
fetch me to the sight of him.

486
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:33.170
Marry, will I; and you shall help

487
00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:34.530
to put him i' the ground.

488
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:39.500
'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.

489
00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:55.670
