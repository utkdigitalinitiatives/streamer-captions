00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.770
It's one o'clock boy is't not

3
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.270
It hath struck.

4
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.130
These should be hours fornecessities,

5
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.370
Not for delights;

6
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.100
times to repair our naturewith comforting repose,

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.130
and not for us to wastethese times.

8
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.870
Good hour of night, SirThomas!

9
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.830
Whither so late?

10
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.530
Came you from the king, mylord

11
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.800
I did, Sir Thomas: andleft him at primero

12
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.600
With the Duke of Suffolk.

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.270
I must to him too, beforehe go to bed.

14
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.270
I'll take my leave.

15
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.430
Not yet, Sir ThomasLovell.

16
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.470
What's the matter? Itseems you are in haste:

17
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.470
an if there be no greatoffence belongs to't,

18
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.370
give your friend some touchof your late business:

19
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.970
affairs, that walk, asthey say spirits do,

20
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.600
at midnight, have in thema wilder nature

21
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.570
than the business thatseeks dispatch by day.

22
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.730
My lord, I love you;

23
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.500
And durst commend a secretto your ear

24
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.530
Much weightier than thiswork.

25
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.730
The queen's in labour,

26
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.970
They say, in greatextremity;

27
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.170
and fear'd she'll with thelabour end.

28
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.100
The fruit she goes with Ipray for heartily,

29
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.670
that it may find goodtime, and live:

30
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.170
but for the stock, SirThomas,

31
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.700
I wish it grubb'd up now.

32
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.830
Methinks I could cry theamen; and yet

33
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.270
my conscience says she's agood creature,

34
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.270
and, sweet lady,

35
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.830
does deserve our betterwishes.

36
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.070
But, sir, sir,

37
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.530
Hear me, Sir Thomas:

38
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.530
you're a gentleman of mineown way;

39
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.830
I know you wise,religious;

40
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.900
And, let me tell you,

41
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.570
it will ne'er be well,

42
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.170
'Twill not, Sir ThomasLovell, take't of me,

43
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.470
Till Cranmer, Cromwell,her two hands, and she,

44
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.670
Sleep in their graves.

45
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.170
Now, sir, you speak oftwo

46
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.770
the most remark'd i' thekingdom.

47
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.000
As for Cromwell, besidethat of the jewel house,

48
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.500
is made master o' therolls,

49
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.170
and the king's secretary;further, sir,

50
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.670
Stands in the gap andtrade of moe preferments,

51
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.800
With which the time willload him.

52
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.000
The archbishop is theking's hand and tongue;

53
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and who dare speak onesyllable against him?

54
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.730
Yes, yes, Sir Thomas;

55
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.030
There are that dare;

56
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.430
and I myself have venturedto speak my mind of him:

57
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.130
and indeed this day, Sir,I may tell it you,

58
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.270
I think I have incensedthe lords o' the council,

59
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.570
that he is, For so I knowhe is, they know he is,

60
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.170
A most arch heretic,

61
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.730
a pestilence that doesinfect the land:

62
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.270
with which they moved havebroken with the king;

63
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.830
who hath so far given earto our complaint,

64
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.300
of his great grace andprincely care

65
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.970
foreseeing those fellmischiefs

66
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.200
Our reasons laid beforehim,

67
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.500
hath commanded to-morrowmorning

68
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.430
to the council-board he beconvented.

69
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.170
He's a rank weed, SirThomas,

70
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.730
And we must root him out.

71
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.400
From your affairs I hinderyou too long:

72
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.370
good night, Sir Thomas.

73
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.970
Many good nights, my lord:I rest your servant.

74
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.870
Charles, I will play nomore tonight;

75
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.000
My mind's not on't; youare too hard for me.

76
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.200
Sir, I did never win ofyou before.

77
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.930
But little, Charles; norshall not,

78
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.970
when my fancy's on myplay.

79
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.570
Now, Lovell, from thequeen what is the news?

80
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.000
I could not personallydeliver to her

81
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.900
What you commanded me,

82
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.230
but by her woman I sentyour message;

83
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.230
who return'd her thanks inthe great'st humbleness,

84
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.800
and desired your highness mostheartily to pray for her.

85
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.070
What say'st thou, ha?

86
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.800
To pray for her? what, isshe crying out?

87
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.570
So said her woman

88
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.400
and that her sufferancemade

89
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.330
Almost each pang a death.

90
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.000
Alas, good lady!

91
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.870
God safely quit her of herburthen,

92
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.170
and with gentle travail,

93
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.030
to the gladding of yourhighness with an heir!

94
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.970
'Tis midnight, Charles;

95
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.700
Prithee, to bed; and inthy prayers

96
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.400

97
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.130
Leave me alone;

98
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.700
For I must think of thatwhich company

99
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.600
Would not be friendly to.

100
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.000
I wish your highness aquiet night;

101
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.870
and my good mistress willremember in my prayers.

102

You cannot with suchfreedom purge yourself,

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.630

Now, by my holidame. Whatmanner of man are you?

150
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.130
My lord, I look'd youwould have

151
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.230
given me your petition,

152
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.500
that I should have ta'ensome pains

153

to bring together yourselfand your accusers;

154
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.870
and to have heard you,

155
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.030
Without indurance,further.

156
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.330
Most dread liege,

157
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.830
The good I stand on is mytruth and honesty:

158
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.230
If they shall fail, I,with mine enemies,

159
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.930
Will triumph o'er myperson;

160
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.100
which I weigh not, beingof those virtues vacant.

161
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.930
I fear nothing what can besaid against me.

162
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.130
Know you not how yourstate stands i' the world,

163
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.930
with the whole world?

164
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.570
Your enemies are many, andnot small;

165
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.630
their practises must bearthe same proportion;

166
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.230
and not ever the justice andthe truth o' the question

167
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.830
carries the due o' theverdict with it:

168
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.500
at what ease might corruptminds

169
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.770
procure knaves as corrupt

170
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.900
To swear against you? suchthings have been done.

171
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:24.930
You are potently opposed;

172
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.330
and with a malice of asgreat size.

173
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.370
Ween you of better luck,

174
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.800
I mean, in perjuredwitness, than your master,

175
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.100
Whose minister you are,

176
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.500
whiles here he lived uponthis naughty earth?

177
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.600
Go to, go to;

178
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.330
You take a precipice forno leap of danger,

179
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.670
And woo your owndestruction.

180
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.730
God and your majestyprotect mine innocence,

181
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.930
or I fall into the trap islaid for me!

182
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:53.870
Be of good cheer;

183
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.730
They shall no more prevailthan we give way to.

184
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.600
Keep comfort to you;

185
00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.770
and this morning see youdo appear before them:

186
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.470
if they shall chance, incharging you with matters,

187
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:02.730
to commit you,

188
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.270
The best persuasions to thecontrary fail not to use,

189
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.100
and with what vehemency

190
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.630
the occasion shallinstruct you:

191
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.670
if entreaties will renderyou no remedy,

192
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.800
this ring deliver them,

193
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.900
and your appeal to usthere make before them.

194
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.070
Look, the good man weeps!

195
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.000
He's honest, on minehonour.

196
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.900
God's blest mother!

197
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.300
I swear he istrue--hearted;

198
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.970
and a soul none better inmy kingdom.

199
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.500
Get you gone, and do as Ihave bid you.

200
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.830
He has strangled hislanguage in his tears.

201
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.400
Come back: what mean you?

202
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.600
I'll not come back;

203
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.270
the tidings that I bring willmake my boldness manners.

204
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.930
Now, good angels fly o'erthy royal head,

205
00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.130
and shade thy person undertheir blessed wings!

206
00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.700
Now, by thy looks I guessthy message.

207
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.230
Is the queen deliver'd?

208
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.630
Say, ay; and of a boy.

209
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.170
Ay, ay, my liege; and of alovely boy:

210
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.730
the God of heaven both nowand ever bless her!

211
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.670
'tis a girl, promises boyshereafter.

212
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.900
Sir, your queen desiresyour visitation,

213
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.870
and to be acquainted withthis stranger

214
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.770
'tis as like you as cherryis to cherry.

215
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.770
Lovell!

216
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:36.770
Sir?

217
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.370
Give her an hundred marks.I'll to the queen.

218
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.070
An hundred marks! By thislight, I'll ha' more.

219
00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.770
An ordinary groom is forsuch payment.

220
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.200
I will have more, or scoldit out of him.

221
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.730
Said I for this, the girlwas like to him?

222
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.570
I will have more, or elseunsay't;

223
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.500
and now, while it is hot,I'll put it to the issue.

224
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.530
I hope I am not too late;

225
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:03.370
and yet the gentleman,

226
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:04.230
that was sent to me fromthe council,

227
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.030
pray'd me to make greathaste.

228
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.930
All fast? what means this?

229
00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.370
Ho! Who waits there?

230
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.730
Sure, you know me?

231
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.630
Yes, my lord; But yet Icannot help you.

232
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.800
Why?

233
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.800
Your grace must wait tillyou be call'd for.

234
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.430
So.

235
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.070
This is a piece of malice.

236
00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.530
I am glad I came this wayso happily:

237
00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.830
the king shall understandit presently.

238
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.670
'Tis Butts, the king'sphysician:

239
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.600
as he pass'd along,

240
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.070
How earnestly he cast hiseyes upon me!

241
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.130
Pray heaven, he sound notmy disgrace!

242
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.430
For certain, this is ofpurpose

243
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:57.100
laid by some that hate meGod turn their hearts!

244
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.070
I never sought theirmalice

245
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.800
To quench mine honour:

246
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.700
they would shame to makeme wait else at door,

247
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.770
a fellow-counsellor,

248
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.030
'Mong boys, grooms, andlackeys.

249
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.330
But their pleasures mustbe fulfill'd,

250
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.970
and I attend withpatience.

251
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.500
I'll show your grace thestrangest sight

252
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.430
What's that, Butts?

253
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.770
I think your highness sawthis many a day.

254
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:22.800
Body o' me, where is it?

255
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.900
There, my lord:

256
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.070
The high promotion of hisgrace of Canterbury;

257
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.270
Who holds his state atdoor, 'mongst pursuivants,

258
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.200
Pages, and footboys.

259
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.100
Ha! 'tis he, indeed:

260
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.430
Is this the honour they doone another?

261
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.500
'Tis well there's oneabove 'em yet.

262
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.470
I had thought they hadparted

263
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.570
so much honesty among 'em

264
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:44.570
At least, good manners,

265
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.200
as not thus to suffer aman of his place,

266
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.300
and so near our favour,

267
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.570
To dance attendance ontheir lordships' pleasures,

268
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.170
And at the door too, likea post with packets.

269
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.300
By holy Mary, Butts,there's knavery:

270
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.300
Speak to the business,master-secretary:

271
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.730
Why are we met in council?

272
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.070
Please your honours,

273
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.630
The chief cause concernshis grace of Canterbury.

274
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.370
Has he had knowledge ofit?

275
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.200
Yes.

276
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.630
Who waits there?

277
00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:18.770
Without, my noble lords?

278
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:19.470
Yes.

279
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:20.900
My lord archbishop;

280
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.270
And has done half an hour,to know your pleasures.

281
00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.170
Let him come in.

282
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.370
Your grace may enter now.

283
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.530
My good lord archbishop,

284
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.630
I'm very sorry to sit hereat this present,

285
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.700
and behold that chairstand empty:

286
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.970
but we all are men,

287
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.800
In our own natures frail,

288
00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:01.030
and capable of our flesh;few are angels:

289
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.200
out of which frailty andwant of wisdom,

290
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.830
you, that best shouldteach us,

291
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.630
Have misdemean'd yourself,and not a little,

292
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.900
Toward the king first,then his laws,

293
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.970
in filling the wholerealm, by your teaching

294
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.430
and your chaplains,

295
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.630
For so we are inform'd,with new opinions,

296
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.770
Divers and dangerous;which are heresies,

297
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:25.330
And, not reform'd, mayprove pernicious.

298
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.600
Which reformation

299
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.730
must be sudden too, mynoble lords;

300
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.570
for those that tame wildhorses

301
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:35.000
Pace 'em not in theirhands to make 'em gentle,

302
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
But stop their mouths withstubborn bits, and spur 'em,

303
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.100
Till they obey the manage.

304
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.430
If we suffer,

305
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.100
Out of our easiness andchildish pity

306
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:47.370
To one man's honour, thiscontagious sickness,

307
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.930
Farewell all physic:

308
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.500
and what follows then?

309
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.300
Commotions, uproars,

310
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.470
with a general taint ofthe whole state:

311
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.430
as, of late days, ourneighbours,

312
00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.130
The upper Germany, candearly witness,

313
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:03.570
Yet freshly pitied in ourmemories.

314
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.330
My good lords,

315
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.570
hitherto, in all theprogress

316
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.230
Both of my life andoffice,

317
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.370
I have labour'd,

318
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.730
And with no little study,

319
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.500
that my teaching and thestrong course

320
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.030
of my authority might goone way,

321
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:24.530
and safely; and the endwas ever, to do well:

322
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.330
nor is there living,

323
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.270
I speak it with a singleheart, my lords,

324
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:35.530
A man that more detests,more stirs against,

325
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.570
Both in his privateconscience and his place,

326
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.400
Defacers of a publicpeace, than I do.

327
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.470
Pray heaven, the king maynever find a heart

328
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.130
With less allegiance init!

329
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:52.870
Men that make envy andcrooked malice nourishment

330
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.870
Dare bite the best.

331
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.800
I do beseech yourlordships,

332
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.230
That, in this case ofjustice,

333
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.300
my accusers, be what theywill,

334
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.330
may stand forth face toface,

335
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.530
And freely urge againstme.

336
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.370
Nay, my lord, that cannotbe:

337
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:10.470
you are a counsellor,

338
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.400
And, by that virtue, noman dare accuse you.

339
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.500
My lord, because we havebusiness of more moment,

340
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.030
We will be short with you.

341
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.170
'Tis his highness'pleasure,

342
00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:26.200
And our consent, forbetter trial of you,

343
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.000
From hence you becommitted to the Tower;

344
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.930
Where, being but a privateman again,

345
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.000
You shall know many dareaccuse you boldly,

346
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.070
More than, I fear, you areprovided for.

347
00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.870
Ah, my good Lord ofWinchester, I thank you;

348
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.170
You are always my goodfriend;

349
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.230
if your will pass,

350
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.800
I shall both find yourlordship judge and juror,

351
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.400
You are so merciful:

352
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.300
I see your end;

353
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.400
'Tis my undoing:

354
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.930
love and meekness, lord,

355
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.100
Become a churchman betterthan ambition:

356
00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.500
Win straying souls withmodesty again,

357
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.030
Cast none away.

358
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:02.270
That I shall clear myself,

359
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.330
Lay all the weight ye canupon my patience,

360
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.370
I make as little doubt,

361
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.970
as you do conscienceindoing daily wrongs.

362
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.000
I could say more,

363
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.070
But reverence to yourcalling makes me modest.

364
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:19.270
My lord, my lord, you area sectary,

365
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.670
That's the plain truth:

366
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.330
your painted glossdiscovers,

367
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.470
To men that understandyou, words and weakness.

368
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.470
My Lord of Winchester, youare a little,

369
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.930
By your good favour, toosharp;

370
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.900
men so noble, howeverfaulty,

371
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.100
yet should find respect

372
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.570
For what they have been:

373
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.430
'tis a cruelty to load afalling man.

374
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.830
Good master secretary,

375
00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.930
I cry your honour mercy;

376
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.130
you may, worst of all thistable, say so.

377
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:45.930
Why, my lord?

378
00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.430
Do not I know you for afavourer

379
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.030
Of this new sect?

380
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.430
ye are not sound.

381
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.130
Not sound?

382
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:52.300
Not sound, I say.

383
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.170
Would you were half sohonest!

384
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.230
Men's prayers then wouldseek you, not their fears.

385
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.230
I shall remember this boldlanguage.

386
00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.900
Do. Remember your boldlife too.

387
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.870
This is too much;

388
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.700
Forbear, for shame, mylords.

389
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.700
I have done.

390
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:08.770
And I.

391
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.400
Then thus for you, mylord:

392
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.730
it stands agreed, I takeit, by all voices,

393
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.530
that forthwith you beconvey'd to the Tower

394
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:18.670
a prisoner;

395
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.300
There to remain till theking's further pleasure

396
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.500
Be known unto us:

397
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.470
are you all agreed, lords?

398
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.100
We are.

399
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.870
Is there no other way ofmercy,

400
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.870
But I must needs to theTower, my lords?

401
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.230
What other would youexpect?

402
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.970
you are strangelytroublesome.

403
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.570
Let some o' the guard beready there.

404
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:42.030
For me? Must I go like atraitor thither?

405
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:45.370
Receive him, and see himsafe i' the Tower.

406
00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.470
Stay,

407
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:52.130
good my lords, I have alittle yet to say.

408
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:55.370
Look there, my lords;

409
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:56.530
By virtue of that ring,

410
00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.570
I take my cause out of thegripes of cruel men,

411
00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.700
and give it to a mostnoble judge,

412
00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.400
the king my master.

413
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.000
This is the king's ring.

414
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.270
'Tis no counterfeit.

415
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.370
'Tis the right ring,

416
00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:10.600
by heaven: I told ye all,

417
00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.370
When ye first put thisdangerous stone a-rolling,

418
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:14.970
'Twould fall uponourselves.

419
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:15.670
Do you think, my lords,

420
00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:16.670
The king will suffer

421
00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.530
but the little finger ofthis man to be vex'd?

422
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.070
'Tis now too certain:

423
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.900
How much more is his lifein value with him?

424
00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.730
Would I were fairly outon't!

425
00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.900
My mind gave me, inseeking tales

426
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.430
and informations againstthis man,

427
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:30.330
whose honesty the deviland his disciples

428
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.830
only envy at,

429
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.800
Ye blew the fire thatburns ye:

430
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.600
now have at ye!

431
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.600
Dread sovereign,

432
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.300
how much are we bound toheaven

433
00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.630
In daily thanks, that gaveus such a prince;

434
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.730
Not only good and wise,but most religious:

435
00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.430
One that, in all obedience,makes the church

436
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.330
The chief aim of hishonour;

437
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.070
and, to strengthen thatholy duty,

438
00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.400
out of dear respect, hisroyal self in judgment

439
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.500
comes to hear the cause

440
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.000
betwixt her and this greatoffender.

441
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.700
You were ever good atsudden commendations,

442
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.300
Bishop of Winchester.

443
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:12.230
But know,

444
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.100
I come not to hear suchflattery now,

445
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.900
and in my presence;

446
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.500
They are too thin and bareto hide offences.

447
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:23.830
To me you cannot reach,you play the spaniel,

448
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.700
And think with wagging ofyour tongue to win me;

449
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.330
But, whatsoe'er thoutakest me for,

450
00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:36.030
I'm sure thou hast a cruelnature and a bloody.

451
00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.500
Good man, sit down.

452
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.800
Now let me see the proudesthe, that dares most,

453
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.770
but wag his finger atthee:

454
00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:47.700
By all that's holy,

455
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.800
he had better starve

456
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.600
Than but once think thisplace becomes thee not.

457
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.800
May it please your grace,

458
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.670
No, sir, it does notplease me.

459
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:57.600
I had thought I had hadmen

460
00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.700
of some understanding andwisdom of my council;

461
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.170
but I find none.

462
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.770
Was it discretion, lords,to let this man,

463
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.630
This good man,--few of youdeserve that title,--

464
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.270
This honest man,

465
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.130
wait like a lousy footboyAt chamberdoor?

466
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.000
and one as great as youare?

467
00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.170
Why, what a shame wasthis!

468
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:26.370
Did my commission bid yeso far forget yourselves?

469
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.370
I gave ye power as he wasa counsellor to try him,

470
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:30.570
Not as a groom:

471
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:32.400
there's some of ye, I see,

472
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.130
More out of malice thanintegrity,

473
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.800
Would try him to theutmost, had ye mean;

474
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.930
Which ye shall never havewhile I live.

475
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.930
Thus far, my most dreadsovereign,

476
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:45.630
may it like your grace tolet my tongue excuse all.

477
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.930
What was purposed concerninghis imprisonment,

478
00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.870
was rather, if there befaith in men,

479
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.300
meant for his trial, andfair purgation to the world,

480
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.470
than malice, I'm sure, inme.

481
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.000
Well, well, my lords,respect him;

482
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.670
Take him, and use himwell, he's worthy of it.

483
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.000
I will say thus much forhim,

484
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.300
if a prince may bebeholding to a subject,

485
00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.300
I am, for his love andservice, so to him.

486
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.470
Make me no more ado, butall embrace him:

487
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.700
Be friends, for shame, mylords!

488
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:30.830
My Lord of Canterbury,

489
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.900
I have a suit which youmust not deny me;

490
00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.130
That is, a fair young maid

491
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:35.730
that yet wants baptism,

492
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.700
You must be godfather, andanswer for her.

493
00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.830
The greatest monarch nowalive may glory

494
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.570
In such an honour:

495
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:42.500
how may I deserve it

496
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.970
That am a poor and humblesubject to you?

497
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.470
Come, come, my lord,you'ld spare your spoons:

498
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:48.070
you shall have two noblepartners with you;

499
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.730
the old Duchess of Norfolk,and Lady Marquess Dorset:

500
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.400
will these please you?

501
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.300
Once more, my Lord ofWinchester, I charge you,

502
00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.270
Embrace and love this man.

503
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:02.300
With a true heart

504
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.930
And brother-love I do it.

505
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.500
And let heaven witness,

506
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.730
how dear I hold thisconfirmation.

507
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:17.570
Good man, those joyfultears show thy true heart:

508
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:18.500
The common voice, I see,

509
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.000
is verified of thee, whichsays thus,

510
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.330
'Do my Lord of Canterburya shrewd turn,

511
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:25.470
and he is your friend forever.'

512
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.000
Come, lords, we trifletime away;

513
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.770
I long to have this youngone made a Christian.

514
00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:35.300
As I have made ye one,lords, one remain;

515
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.800
So I grow stronger, youmore honour gain.

516

a thousand thousandblessings,

543
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.930
Which time shall bring toripeness:

544
00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:43.930
she shall be--

545
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:47.400
but few now living canbehold that goodness--

546
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.470
A pattern to all princesliving with her,

547
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:51.130
And all that shallsucceed:

548
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.670
Saba was never morecovetous of wisdom

549
00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:54.830
and fair virtue

550
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:57.470
Than this pure soulshall be:

551
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.400
all princely graces,

552
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:06.330
That mould up such amighty piece as this is,

553
00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.630
With all the virtues thatattend the good,

554
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.970
Shall still be doubled onher:

555
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.200
truth shall nurse her,

556
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.530
Holy and heavenly thoughtsstill counsel her:

557
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.500
She shall be loved andfear'd:

558
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.670
her own shall bless her;

559
00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:26.230
Her foes shake like afield of beaten corn,

560
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:30.270
And hang their heads withsorrow:

561
00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.600
good grows with her:

562
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.000
In her days every manshall eat in safety,

563
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.500
Under his own vine, whathe plants;

564
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.670
and sing the merry songs ofpeace to all his neighbours:

565
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:43.800
God shall be truly known;

566
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.970
and those about her

567
00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:49.170
from her shall read theperfect ways of honour,

568
00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:52.600
And by those claim theirgreatness,

569
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.230
not by blood.

570
00:25:56.230 --> 00:26:01.200
Nor shall this peace sleepwith her:

571
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.330
but as when the bird ofwonder dies,

572
00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:04.800
the maiden phoenix,

573
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.000
Her ashes new createanother heir,

574
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.670
As great in admiration asherself;

575
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:15.570
So shall she leave herblessedness to one,

576
00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.230
When heaven shall call her

577
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:20.400
from this cloud ofdarkness,

578
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.730
Who from the sacred ashesof her honour

579
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:28.330
Shall star-like rise, asgreat in fame as she was,

580
00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:33.330
And so stand fix'd:

581
00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:37.730
peace, plenty, love,truth, terror,

582
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.430
That were the servants tothis chosen infant,

583
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:47.430
Shall then be his, andlike a vine grow to him:

584
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.070
Wherever the bright sun ofheaven shall shine,

585
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:50.830
His honour and thegreatness of his name

586
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:54.530
Shall be, and make newnations:

587
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.970
he shall flourish,

588
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:58.600
And, like a mountaincedar,

589
00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:03.200
reach his branches to allthe plains about him:

590
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:09.000
our children's childrenshall see this,

591
00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:11.830
and bless heaven.

592
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.900
Thou speakest wonders.

593
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.870
She shall be, to thehappiness of England,

594
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.500
An aged princess;

595
00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.830
many days shall see her,

596
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:28.170
And yet no day without adeed to crown it.

597
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.570
Would I had known nomore!

598
00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:35.100
but she must die,

599
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.200
She must, the saints musthave her; yet a virgin,

600
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.000
A most unspotted lilyshall she pass

601
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.800
To the ground,

602
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.730
and all the world shallmourn her.

603
00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:51.130
O lord archbishop,

604
00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.000
Thou hast made me now aman!

605
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.100
never, before this happychild, did I get any thing:

606
00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.930
This oracle of comfort hasso pleased me,

607
00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:00.700
That when I am in heaven

608
00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.400
I shall desire to see whatthis child does,

609
00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.400
and praise my Maker.

610
00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.900
I thank ye all.

611
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.030
To you, my good lordmayor,

612
00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.530

I have received muchhonour by your presence,

615
00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.500
And ye shall find methankful.

616
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.970
Lead the way, lords:

617
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:24.770
Ye must all see the queen,and she must thank ye,

618
00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.470
She will be sick else.

619
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.570
This day, no man think hasbusiness at his house;

620
00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:31.130
for all shall stay:

621
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.430
This little one shall makeit holiday.

622
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:44.830
