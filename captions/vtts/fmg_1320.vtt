00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:09.933
[foreboding music]

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:38.333
[ominous music]

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:44.566
- Ismene,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.366
listen.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.266
The same blood
flows in both our veins,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.966
doesn't it, my sister?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The blood of Oedipus.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.660
And suffering,
which was his destiny,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.200
is our punishment too,

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:57.900
the sentence passed
on all his children:

00:01:57.933 --> 00:02:01.700
physical pain, contempt,
insults, every kind of dishonor.

00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:05.433
We've seen them all and
endured them all, the two of us.

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:08.330
But there's more to come.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.633
Now,

00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:11.866
today...

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:17.233
Have you heard it?

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:18.366
This new proclamation

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.966
which the king has made
to the whole city?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.733
Have you heard how those
nearest to us are to be treated,

00:02:22.766 --> 00:02:24.700
with a contempt that we reserve
for traitors,

00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:25.866
people we love?

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.500
- Nobody has told me anything,
Antigone.

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:30.466
I've heard nothing, neither good
nor bad, about anyone we love,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.433
not since the battle, I mean,

00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:35.133
the terrible news that
both our brothers were dead.

00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:38.433
One day, one battle,
and fratricide twice over,

00:02:38.466 --> 00:02:41.266
each brother
cutting down his own flesh.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.600
But the army from Argos
retreated last night.

00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:44.833
I have heard that, nothing else

00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:46.566
to cheer me up
or depress me further.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.700
- I thought you hadn't.

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.166
That's why I asked you
to meet me here,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.400
where I can tell you
everything

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:52.100
without any risk
of being overheard.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.660
[loud clanging]

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.900
- What is it, then?

00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:04.333
More terrible news?

00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:07.433
Something black and frightening,
I can see that.

00:03:07.466 --> 00:03:10.000
- Well, what do you think,
Ismene?

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
Perhaps you can guess.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.866
We have two brothers,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.500
both of them dead,

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:19.533
and Creon has decreed
that a decent burial

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.866
shall be given to one

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.000
but not to the other.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.933
Eteocles apparently
has already been buried

00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:27.966
with full military honors

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.633
not far short
of a state funeral,

00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:32.900
with all the formalities due
to the dead meticulously observed,

00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:34.500
so that his rest
in the underworld

00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:37.166
amongst the heroes is assured.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.200
But Polynices,

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:42.133
who died in agony
just as certainly as his brother did,

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:46.200
is not to be buried at all.

00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:48.533
The decree
makes that quite plain.

00:03:48.566 --> 00:03:50.966
He is to be left
lying where he fell,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.733
with no tears
or ceremonies of mourning,

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:54.466
to stink in the open

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.300
till the kites and vultures
catch the scent

00:03:56.333 --> 00:04:00.100
and tear him to pieces
and pick him to the bone!

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:02.700
Left unburied, there is no rest
for him in the underworld,

00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:04.200
no more than here.

00:04:08.933 --> 00:04:14.900
What a great king our Creon is,
eh, sister?

00:04:14.933 --> 00:04:16.500
It's against us, you realize,

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:17.933
and against me in particular

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:20.330
that he has published
this decree.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.900
And he'll soon be here himself
to make it public

00:04:21.933 --> 00:04:23.933
to the senators and anyone
who may not have heard it.

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:25.000
He isn't bluffing.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.660
He means to act
to make it stick.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.366
The punishment for anyone
who disobeys the order

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.666
is public stoning to death.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.200
So that's the news,

00:04:39.233 --> 00:04:40.233
and you know it now.

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:41.600
The time has come for you too

00:04:41.633 --> 00:04:43.266
to stand up
and be counted with me,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.600
to show whether you are worthy

00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:46.266
of the honor
of being Oedipus' daughter.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.200
- Wait a minute, Antigone.

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:50.433
Don't be so headstrong.

00:04:50.466 --> 00:04:52.100
If all this is
as you say it is,

00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:53.466
what can I do
one way or the other?

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.300
- Just say you'll help me.

00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:57.660
Commit yourself.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.666
- To do what,
something dangerous?

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.660
- Just to give me a hand
to lift the body.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.233
It's too heavy
for me to move on my own.

00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:08.500
- To bury him, you mean,
in spite of the decree?

00:05:08.533 --> 00:05:09.800
- He is my brother.

00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:11.533
And whatever you say,
he's yours too.

00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:13.000
I won't betray him
now that he's dead.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.466
No one will ever
throw that in my face.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.766
- You can't do it.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.300
Creon has publicly forbidden it.

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:19.300
- He cannot forbid me
to love my brother.

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:21.733
He has neither the right
nor the power to do that.

00:05:21.766 --> 00:05:25.200
- Have you forgotten
what happened to our father?

00:05:25.233 --> 00:05:27.100
Contempt and loathing
from everyone,

00:05:27.133 --> 00:05:29.330
even from himself,
that was his reward,

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.566
and blinded too by his own hand.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.933
And his mother-wife,
as ill-matched with him

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:35.466
as those two words are
with each other,

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.633
she knotted a rope
and hanged herself.

00:05:37.666 --> 00:05:38.900
And now our two brothers,

00:05:38.933 --> 00:05:41.400
both in one day
caught in the same trap,

00:05:41.433 --> 00:05:43.200
claiming blood for blood
and death for death,

00:05:43.233 --> 00:05:45.300
each one
at the expense of the other.

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:48.000
We are the last ones left,
sister.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.500
And what a death
is promised for us,

00:05:49.533 --> 00:05:51.466
more terrible than any
if we break the law

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.800
by defying the king
and the power of the state.

00:05:54.833 --> 00:05:57.100
Think for a moment,
Antigone, please.

00:05:57.133 --> 00:05:59.133
We're women, that's all.

00:05:59.166 --> 00:06:02.933
Physically weaker and barred
from any political influence,

00:06:02.966 --> 00:06:04.333
how can we fight

00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:07.766
against the institutionalized
strength of the male sex?

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.900
They are in power,
and we have to obey them,

00:06:09.933 --> 00:06:13.766
or worse tyrannies than these
may be inflicted upon us.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.633
May God forgive me
and the spirits of the dead;

00:06:16.666 --> 00:06:18.833
we have no choice.

00:06:18.866 --> 00:06:22.666
State power commands,
and we must do as we are told.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.800
When you are powerless,

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:25.466
wild gestures
and heroic refusals

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.500
are reserved for madmen.

00:06:26.533 --> 00:06:29.433
- Don't say any more.

00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:32.300
I won't ask again.

00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:36.533
In fact, if you were to offer help now,
I would refuse it.

00:06:36.566 --> 00:06:38.633
Do as you please.

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:41.700
I intend to bury my brother.

00:06:41.733 --> 00:06:43.100
And if I die in the attempt,

00:06:43.133 --> 00:06:45.533
I shall die in the knowledge
that I have acted justly,

00:06:45.566 --> 00:06:48.366
and that will be
a kind of happiness.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.366
I shall lie peacefully
beside my brother

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.330
whom I loved in my actions
as well as in words.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.266
Our lives are short.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.566
We have too little time

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.500
to waste it on men
and the laws they make.

00:06:59.533 --> 00:07:03.433
The approval of the dead
is everlasting,

00:07:03.466 --> 00:07:07.100
and I shall bask in it
as I lie among them.

00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:08.600
Do as you please.

00:07:08.633 --> 00:07:10.433
Live, by all means.

00:07:10.466 --> 00:07:12.533
The laws you will break
are not of man's making.

00:07:12.566 --> 00:07:14.566
- I reverenced them,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.933
but how can I defy
the unlimited power of the state?

00:07:16.966 --> 00:07:18.833
What weapons of mine
are strong enough for that?

00:07:18.866 --> 00:07:21.566
- Fine.
That's a good excuse.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.100
I'll go and shovel the earth
on my brother's body.

00:07:24.133 --> 00:07:26.766
- I'm frightened, Antigone,
and frightened for you.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.666
- Don't be frightened for me.
Fear for yourself.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.166
- For God's sake,
keep it quiet.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.200
Don't tell anyone.

00:07:31.233 --> 00:07:32.366
I'll keep our meeting secret.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.833
- Don't you dare.

00:07:33.866 --> 00:07:36.600
You must tell everyone.
Shout it in the streets.

00:07:36.633 --> 00:07:38.666
If you keep it quiet,
I shall begin to hate you.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.533
- There's a fire burning
in you, Antigone,

00:07:40.566 --> 00:07:42.100
but it makes me go cold
just to hear you.

00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:43.633
- Well, I'm not doing it
to please you.

00:07:43.666 --> 00:07:45.433
- You won't do it at all.
You're bound to fail.

00:07:45.466 --> 00:07:47.533
- I shall fail when I have failed
and not before.

00:07:47.566 --> 00:07:48.933
- But you know it's hopeless.

00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:51.660
Why begin when you know
there's no way you can succeed?

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.400
- Be quiet,

00:07:52.433 --> 00:07:56.266
before I begin to despise you
for talking so feebly.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.966
He will despise you too,
and justly.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.766
You can go now.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.666
Go!

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.166
If I'm mad, you can leave me
here with my madness,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.533
which will doubtless
destroy me soon enough.

00:08:11.566 --> 00:08:15.266
Death is the worst thing
that can happen,

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.666
and some deaths
are more honorable than others.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.330
- If you've made your mind up,

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.600
Antigone, it's madness.

00:08:26.633 --> 00:08:29.633
Remember, I love you,

00:08:29.666 --> 00:08:31.933
whatever happens.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.660
- The life-giving Sun

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.333
has never shone more brightly

00:09:19.366 --> 00:09:21.433
on the seven gates of Thebes

00:09:21.466 --> 00:09:23.266
than he shines this morning.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.966
- Never a more glorious dawning

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.900
than this sunrise
over Dirke's river,

00:09:28.933 --> 00:09:31.200
when the army
of the foreign invader

00:09:31.233 --> 00:09:34.600
at first light
made its panic-stricken flight

00:09:34.633 --> 00:09:36.700
and all its white shields

00:09:36.733 --> 00:09:39.766
and its bright weapons
were gone.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.500
- Like a snowy eagle
from the mountain crest it came

00:09:42.533 --> 00:09:44.833
shrieking down on our city...

00:09:44.866 --> 00:09:47.333
- The army of Argos
with a spurious treaty

00:09:47.366 --> 00:09:49.666
to enforce Polynices' claim...

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.266
all: All its horsehair plumes
knotting together

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.166
and the grinding of brass

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.233
and the creaking of leather.

00:09:57.266 --> 00:09:59.733
[chimes clanging]

00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:03.900
- By our seven shuttered gates,

00:10:03.933 --> 00:10:04.966
it waited...

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.966
- Eyes glittering
in dark helmets...

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
- Swords drawn,
spears couching.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.833
- But before the killing
and burning...

00:10:10.866 --> 00:10:12.866
- The metallic
taste of blood...

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.330
- And crashing stonework
and blazing wood...

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.666
- They turned and fled...

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.300
- The music of death
in their ears.

00:10:20.333 --> 00:10:23.333
- At their backs,
the dragon's breath.

00:10:23.366 --> 00:10:24.866
all: Zeus has seen them,

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.466
he who hates inflicted pride

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.900
and the empty boasts
of a windbag.

00:10:29.933 --> 00:10:31.800
He heard their singing

00:10:31.833 --> 00:10:34.566
as if the victory
were theirs for the taking.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.800
- And he brought down
his thunder

00:10:36.833 --> 00:10:38.333
on their glittering host.

00:10:38.366 --> 00:10:40.766
- Struck them with lightning
and sent them flying...

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.233
all: Scorched them
and burned them

00:10:43.266 --> 00:10:47.100
and left them dying.

00:10:47.133 --> 00:10:50.100
- Down like a rock
from the mountain crest he came,

00:10:50.133 --> 00:10:51.833
thundering to Earth,

00:10:51.866 --> 00:10:53.966
the flame dashed
from his hand.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.566
- The son of Thebes,
whose best hope of fame

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.733
was to conquer his native land

00:10:58.766 --> 00:11:00.866
and who failed in his quest.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.900
all: For the war god
gave us his word of command.

00:11:03.933 --> 00:11:05.600
Like a battle giant,

00:11:05.633 --> 00:11:09.133
his terrible name
ran them down where they stood,

00:11:09.166 --> 00:11:12.733
and they died in the dust.

00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:15.600
- Now at each
of our seven gates,

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:17.233
a Theban defender waits

00:11:17.266 --> 00:11:20.566
as seven champions bring their
fame and armor to the fight.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.266
- And before
the coming of night,

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.330
six have put their fame
to the test.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.900
- Six have laid
both fame and armor to rest

00:11:26.933 --> 00:11:29.000
as a tribute
at great Zeus' feet.

00:11:30.266 --> 00:11:31.966
- At the seventh gate,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.660
two brothers meet,

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.433
sharing their blood in death

00:11:36.466 --> 00:11:37.800
as in birth.

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:40.433
all: Each striking together,

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:42.800
each laying the other

00:11:42.833 --> 00:11:45.733
dead on the earth.

00:12:06.866 --> 00:12:10.000
all: There will be
victory celebrations today

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.600
in the city of charioteers

00:12:12.633 --> 00:12:14.833
and singing in the streets.

00:12:14.866 --> 00:12:16.200
There will be seven days

00:12:16.233 --> 00:12:18.800
of thanksgiving
and grateful tears

00:12:18.833 --> 00:12:20.333
for the end of the fighting

00:12:20.366 --> 00:12:22.166
as the enemy retreats

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.633
and the time comes
for relaxation and play.

00:12:25.666 --> 00:12:28.366
- Now as all voices
are raised

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.533
and the drum beats...

00:12:29.566 --> 00:12:32.466
- The ecstatic god himself
will appear...

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.933
all: Bacchus, the drunkard...

00:12:34.966 --> 00:12:39.900
- To take power for one day
in this city he calls his own.

00:12:39.933 --> 00:12:42.666
Time to dance all night,

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.533
to shake the foundations...

00:12:44.566 --> 00:12:48.300
- Till the faint light of dawn
flushes the windows

00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:50.133
and the lamps fade.

00:13:06.933 --> 00:13:10.166
- Now Creon is king.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.233
He made the most of his fortune

00:13:13.266 --> 00:13:15.166
and the gods' choice,

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.133
the son of Menoeceus.

00:13:17.166 --> 00:13:19.500
As the people rejoice,

00:13:19.533 --> 00:13:23.433
the new king enters
to take his throne,

00:13:23.466 --> 00:13:27.833
the responsibility: his alone.

00:13:43.733 --> 00:13:45.366
- But why has he called us here

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.200
to debate an emergency session?

00:13:47.233 --> 00:13:48.600
- His new proclamation

00:13:48.633 --> 00:13:50.833
so vital to the state.

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:03.700
- Senators,

00:14:03.733 --> 00:14:05.766
our country, like a ship at sea,

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.766
has survived the hurricane.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.933
The gods who sent it

00:14:09.966 --> 00:14:13.330
have navigated us
into calmer waters now.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:14.933
[applause]

00:14:14.966 --> 00:14:17.433
I have chosen
to summon this assembly

00:14:17.466 --> 00:14:20.666
because I know I can trust you.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.233
Your predecessors were loyal

00:14:22.266 --> 00:14:24.833
and reliable
in King Laius' time.

00:14:24.866 --> 00:14:27.733
And when King Oedipus,
in his exceptional wisdom,

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:30.666
restored the fortunes
of this city,

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.966
when tragedy struck him
and his rule was ended,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.866
your loyalty to the blood royal
was never questioned.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.000
And you supported his sons
till they too were brought down

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.300
on a single day,
incestuously murdered,

00:14:42.333 --> 00:14:46.333
each brother
shedding a brother's blood.

00:14:46.366 --> 00:14:51.433
By that same blood right,
as next of kin,

00:14:51.466 --> 00:14:53.466
I claim the throne
as my inheritance,

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.566
both the city and the kingdom.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.500
I claim it,

00:14:57.533 --> 00:15:00.433
and I hold it from today

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:05.660
as mine by right.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.166
There is no certain measure
of a man's quality,

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.233
the depth of his intellect,

00:15:08.266 --> 00:15:10.166
or the maturity
of his judgment

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.200
until he is
put to the supreme test

00:15:12.233 --> 00:15:16.300
by the exercise
of absolute power in the state.

00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:18.733
My own opinion is well known:

00:15:18.766 --> 00:15:20.800
the ruler who fears the
consequences of his actions

00:15:20.833 --> 00:15:22.366
or who is afraid to act openly

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.466
or take the good advice
of his senators

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.400
is beneath contempt.

00:15:26.433 --> 00:15:28.233
Equally contemptible
is the man who puts

00:15:28.266 --> 00:15:30.100
the interests
of his friends or his relations

00:15:30.133 --> 00:15:31.533
before his country.

00:15:31.566 --> 00:15:34.733
There is nothing good
can be said of him.

00:15:34.766 --> 00:15:37.333
Let me make it plain
before the gods,

00:15:37.366 --> 00:15:39.800
whose eyes
are in every council chamber:

00:15:39.833 --> 00:15:41.700
when I see
any threat to this nation

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:42.766
from whatever direction,

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.533
I shall make it public.

00:15:44.566 --> 00:15:46.233
No one who is an enemy
of the state

00:15:46.266 --> 00:15:48.660
shall ever be
any friend of mine.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:53.533
The state, the fatherland
is everything to us,

00:15:53.566 --> 00:15:55.166
the ship we all sail in.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.330
If she sinks, we all drown,
and friendship drowns with us.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.666
That's my policy,

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.433
a policy of service
to the commonwealth.

00:16:04.466 --> 00:16:08.333
And in pursuance of that policy,

00:16:08.366 --> 00:16:10.833
I have issued
an official state decree

00:16:10.866 --> 00:16:14.500
concerning the sons of Oedipus.

00:16:14.533 --> 00:16:18.330
Eteocles, who died
fighting for his country

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.466
and with exceptional bravery,

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.166
we shall bury him
with all the honors

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:27.166
and funeral ceremonies customary
for a man who died a hero.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.900
The other, the outcast,
the exile,

00:16:31.933 --> 00:16:34.466
his brother, Polynices,

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.433
who returned here
at the head of a foreign army

00:16:36.466 --> 00:16:38.266
to destroy his homeland,

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.733
burn down this city,

00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:41.766
and reduce the people
to a condition of slavery

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.800
or kill them in the streets,

00:16:44.833 --> 00:16:48.466
I have ordered that
he is to have no grave at all.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.366
No one is to bury him
or mourn for him.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.566
His body is to be
left in the open uncovered,

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.566
a stinking feast
for the scavengers,

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.766
dogs and crows,

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.330
a sight to inspire terror.

00:17:01.133 --> 00:17:03.400
I intend to make it quite plain

00:17:03.433 --> 00:17:07.366
that never
under my administration

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.700
will people who commit
crimes against the state

00:17:09.733 --> 00:17:12.700
reap any benefits
from their actions,

00:17:12.733 --> 00:17:17.233
and at the expense of honest,
decent citizens too.

00:17:17.266 --> 00:17:20.500
The people who serve the state,
alive or dead--

00:17:20.533 --> 00:17:22.733
that makes no difference--

00:17:22.766 --> 00:17:25.660
I shall honor them

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.633
and reward them too.

00:17:27.666 --> 00:17:29.300
- Son of Menoeceus,

00:17:29.333 --> 00:17:31.660
you are king now.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.966
You have delivered your verdict
and sentence

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.566
upon the man
who defended the city

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.266
and the man who attacked it
unambiguously.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.433
- Your least word
has the force of law,

00:17:41.466 --> 00:17:43.900
and it binds the dead
as well as the living.

00:17:43.933 --> 00:17:46.866
We are all at your disposal.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.330
- Make sure then
that my orders are carried out.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.200
- Younger men than us
should implement your policies.

00:17:53.233 --> 00:17:55.330
- I don't mean that.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.966
Polynices' body
is already under guard.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.333
- What else must we do?

00:17:59.366 --> 00:18:02.166
- What other responsibility
do you lay upon us?

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.966
- Not to intrigue
with dissidents

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.800
or subversive elements.

00:18:05.833 --> 00:18:08.600
- We are not mad, sir.

00:18:08.633 --> 00:18:11.100
- We know the law
and the penalty for breaking it.

00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:12.633
- Which will be death.

00:18:12.666 --> 00:18:15.433
And be in no doubt
I shall enforce it,

00:18:15.466 --> 00:18:17.933
because there are always men
who can be bought,

00:18:17.966 --> 00:18:19.866
who will risk anything,
even death,

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.466
if the bribe is large enough.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.866
- [gasping]

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.766
My lord Creon!

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.100
Oh, sir!

00:18:27.133 --> 00:18:29.433
Oh, I can hardly speak
for lack of breath,

00:18:29.466 --> 00:18:30.833
not 'cause I ran.

00:18:30.866 --> 00:18:32.666
I kept on stopping,
as a matter of fact,

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.133
half a dozen times,

00:18:34.166 --> 00:18:36.533
and I hung about
as much as I dared.

00:18:36.566 --> 00:18:39.466
I haven't thought about anything
so much for a long time.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.500
Listen!

00:18:40.533 --> 00:18:42.100
"Don't hurry," I said to myself.

00:18:42.133 --> 00:18:43.366
"Chances are, dimwit,

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.633
you're hurrying
to the firing squad."

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:47.500
But then I said to myself,
you see,

00:18:47.533 --> 00:18:49.566
"Hang about," I said,
"or, rather, don't,

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.500
"because if Creon hears this
from somebody else,

00:18:51.533 --> 00:18:52.633
you're really in trouble."

00:18:52.666 --> 00:18:54.933
So I hurried here
as slow as I could,

00:18:54.966 --> 00:18:56.133
if you see what I mean.

00:18:56.166 --> 00:18:57.800
[chuckles]

00:18:57.833 --> 00:18:59.466
It's funny
how long a mile can take you

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.900
when you're thinking
what I was thinking.

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:04.733
However, duty called in the end,

00:19:04.766 --> 00:19:07.833
and I reckoned it would be safer
to face it out.

00:19:07.866 --> 00:19:09.566
He may be unimportant,

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.166
but I've come here,
so now I'll tell you.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.466
If I'm punished for it,

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.233
the gods will be behind it,
that's for sure,

00:19:15.266 --> 00:19:16.866
so I wouldn't have
escaped it anyway.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.666
- Have sense, man.
Why are you frightened?

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.933
- Well, first of all, sir,

00:19:20.966 --> 00:19:23.833
for myself, like,
my own point of view,

00:19:23.866 --> 00:19:25.133
I never done it,

00:19:25.166 --> 00:19:26.733
and I didn't see
who else done it neither,

00:19:26.766 --> 00:19:28.433
so I shouldn't be punished
for it, should I?

00:19:28.466 --> 00:19:30.466
- Is there any need
for all this preamble?

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.566
You take great care

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.333
to disassociate yourself
from what you say.

00:19:33.366 --> 00:19:34.400
It must be bad news.

00:19:34.433 --> 00:19:37.266
- It is bad news, sir,
I'm afraid.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.733
I don't know
how to put it for the best.

00:19:38.766 --> 00:19:41.200
- The plainest way,
and then we can have done with you.

00:19:41.233 --> 00:19:44.766
- Straight out with it, then.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.433
The--

00:19:46.466 --> 00:19:48.660
the body's buried.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.500
Well, someone or other--

00:19:49.533 --> 00:19:51.333
a handful of dust,
that's all, dry dust,

00:19:51.366 --> 00:19:53.633
but properly sprinkled,
you know, religiously,

00:19:53.666 --> 00:19:55.133
and then gone, whoever it was.

00:19:55.166 --> 00:19:58.500
- Do you know
what you're saying?

00:19:58.533 --> 00:20:00.900
Who has dared
to disobey my orders?

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:03.333
- No way of knowing, sir.
We've no idea.

00:20:03.366 --> 00:20:05.500
There'd been no digging,
no spade marks or nothing.

00:20:05.533 --> 00:20:07.100
The ground's rock hard.

00:20:07.133 --> 00:20:08.566
There were no
wheel tracks either,

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.500
from a chariot
or cart or anything--

00:20:10.533 --> 00:20:13.333
in fact, no clues
of any kind at all,

00:20:13.366 --> 00:20:16.566
nothing to tell you
who might have done it.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.400
Well, when the sentry
taking the early turn

00:20:18.433 --> 00:20:20.333
discovered what had happened
and reported back,

00:20:20.366 --> 00:20:22.833
we were all shattered
and scared stiff.

00:20:22.866 --> 00:20:26.566
It was as though
the body had disappeared.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.100
Well, not buried
in a proper grave, I don't mean,

00:20:29.133 --> 00:20:31.366
but lightly covered
with a layer of earth,

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.333
well, almost as though
some passing stranger

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:35.566
with a religious turn of mind,

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.966
knowing that being left unburied

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.166
means everlasting anguish
and wandering without rest,

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.100
had scattered a few handfuls.

00:20:42.133 --> 00:20:44.330
There was no
track of animals either,

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.233
not from dogs or anything
that might have gnawed at it

00:20:46.266 --> 00:20:47.766
and covered it over
with their own legs

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.866
like they do a bone.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.166
A real row started then,
I can tell you.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.600
We all shouted at each other,
and it could have been a fight.

00:20:54.633 --> 00:20:56.566
There was no one there
to stop us.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.233
Well, any one of us
could have done it.

00:20:58.266 --> 00:20:59.966
We all suspected each other,

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.700
but we all denied it,

00:21:01.733 --> 00:21:02.900
and there was no evidence

00:21:02.933 --> 00:21:05.933
to prove one man guilty
rather than another.

00:21:05.966 --> 00:21:08.733
So then we all dared each other

00:21:08.766 --> 00:21:10.900
to swear to go
through fire and water,

00:21:10.933 --> 00:21:12.933
to hold red-hot pokers
in our hands

00:21:12.966 --> 00:21:15.600
and call all the gods
as witnesses that we hadn't done it

00:21:15.633 --> 00:21:16.933
and didn't know anyone who had

00:21:16.966 --> 00:21:19.660
or would even think of it,
let alone do it.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.800
And none of any of it
got us nowhere.

00:21:23.166 --> 00:21:25.133
Then one of the fellows
had his say,

00:21:25.166 --> 00:21:27.566
and he scared us all shitless,
I can tell you.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.666
He said--
and we knew he was dead right--

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.733
there was no way out of it.

00:21:30.766 --> 00:21:32.466
We had to do it
and take our chances.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.660
This fellow said one of us lot
must tell the king,

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.200
because we can't just hide it,
can we?

00:21:38.233 --> 00:21:39.433
So that's what he said,

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:41.533
and we knew he was right.

00:21:41.566 --> 00:21:44.833
So we decided
we'd have to draw lots.

00:21:44.866 --> 00:21:48.633
And just my luck,
I drew the short straw.

00:21:48.666 --> 00:21:52.433
So here I am,

00:21:52.466 --> 00:21:54.000
and I don't like telling it,

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.660
not one little bit more
than you like hearing it,

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.733
for the bloke who brings
bad news never gets a medal.

00:22:00.533 --> 00:22:01.866
- My lord Creon,

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.566
this policy of yours
has worried me from the start.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.233
- My political instinct
tells me

00:22:06.266 --> 00:22:08.433
this may be some sort
of warning or sign

00:22:08.466 --> 00:22:09.800
and perhaps from the gods.

00:22:09.833 --> 00:22:11.966
- How dare you?

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.500
Shut your mouths,
both of you,

00:22:13.533 --> 00:22:14.900
before I lose my temper.

00:22:14.933 --> 00:22:17.566
And you, if you are
a superannuated fool,

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.300
at least don't talk like one.

00:22:20.333 --> 00:22:24.633
Is it likely, remotely likely,
that the gods would think twice

00:22:24.666 --> 00:22:27.433
over that pile of stinking meat?

00:22:27.466 --> 00:22:29.133
By God, it's blasphemy

00:22:29.166 --> 00:22:30.866
even to suggest
that they would care a damn

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.533
whether he was buried or not,

00:22:32.566 --> 00:22:34.800
let alone grant him
an honorable funeral

00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:36.866
as though he were one
of their principal supporters.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.100
What?

00:22:38.133 --> 00:22:39.900
The man who came
to burn down their temples,

00:22:39.933 --> 00:22:41.200
plunder their treasuries,

00:22:41.233 --> 00:22:42.400
pull down their statues,

00:22:42.433 --> 00:22:44.330
and make a mockery
of all their laws?

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.133
Do the gods love criminals
these days?

00:22:47.166 --> 00:22:49.233
No, they do not.

00:22:49.266 --> 00:22:52.700
But, gentlemen,
there are men in this city,

00:22:52.733 --> 00:22:53.933
and I've noted them:

00:22:53.966 --> 00:22:56.633
a subversive faction,
enemies of the state,

00:22:56.666 --> 00:22:59.433
a cell of oppositionists--
call them what you will--

00:22:59.466 --> 00:23:02.800
who reject the laws
and my leadership.

00:23:02.833 --> 00:23:03.933
They meet in secret,

00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:07.660
nod and whisper
and talk of the great day.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.566
Seditious men they are,

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.500
and they are behind this.

00:23:11.533 --> 00:23:14.300
Any fool can see that.

00:23:14.333 --> 00:23:18.166
Their bribery
has suborned my soldiers

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:23.300
and paid for this demonstration
against my authority.

00:23:23.333 --> 00:23:25.200
Money, gentlemen,

00:23:25.233 --> 00:23:26.733
money:

00:23:26.766 --> 00:23:28.500
the virus that infects mankind

00:23:28.533 --> 00:23:30.330
with every sickness
we have a name for,

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.533
no greater scourge than that.

00:23:32.566 --> 00:23:36.233
Money it is that pounds
great citizens to piles of rubble,

00:23:36.266 --> 00:23:39.666
turns people by the millions
into homeless refugees,

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.933
takes honest citizens
and corrupts them into doing things

00:23:42.966 --> 00:23:45.566
they'd be ashamed to think of
before the fee was mentioned,

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:50.466
and in the end, brings them
into the execution chamber.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.166
Well, whoever they are,
these men who have sold themselves,

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.166
they'll find the price
considerably higher

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.100
than they thought it was.

00:23:59.133 --> 00:24:01.366
You, come here.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.533
Come here!

00:24:04.566 --> 00:24:09.000
By Zeus, whom I regard
as my personal patron,

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:10.700
and by all the gods
men worship anywhere,

00:24:10.733 --> 00:24:12.133
I swear to you, soldier,
that either

00:24:12.166 --> 00:24:14.900
you will find the man
who buried Polynices' body

00:24:14.933 --> 00:24:17.333
in defiance
of my express command,

00:24:17.366 --> 00:24:19.330
bring him here to me,

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.233
the actual man
who has sprinkled the earth--

00:24:21.266 --> 00:24:22.400
no other will do--

00:24:22.433 --> 00:24:24.966
stand him here in front of me,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.500
or you, soldier,
will die for it.

00:24:27.533 --> 00:24:31.300
Death, I promise you,
will be the least of your punishments.

00:24:31.333 --> 00:24:33.766
You will be made
a public example

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.330
and interrogated
by the security police,

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.266
kept standing,
beaten across the feet,

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.433
the whole repertoire
of special techniques

00:24:41.466 --> 00:24:44.533
at which we excel so much,

00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:47.600
until you confess the full range
of this conspiracy:

00:24:47.633 --> 00:24:52.766
who paid you, how much,
and for what purpose.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.600
The choice is yours.

00:24:55.633 --> 00:24:59.700
Perhaps that indicates where
your own best interests lie.

00:24:59.733 --> 00:25:02.433
Crimes against the state
and its laws, you'll find,

00:25:02.466 --> 00:25:05.300
are very unprofitable
in the end.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.200
- Am I allowed to speak, sir?

00:25:08.233 --> 00:25:09.300
- Why should you speak?

00:25:09.333 --> 00:25:11.100
Every word you say
is painful to me.

00:25:11.133 --> 00:25:12.833
- Well, it can't be an earache,
can it, sir?

00:25:12.866 --> 00:25:14.166
Not what I said.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.800
It must stick in your gullet
or further down maybe,

00:25:16.833 --> 00:25:18.133
a sort of pain
in the conscience?

00:25:18.166 --> 00:25:20.660
- Do you dare to answer me back

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.666
and make jokes
about my conscience?

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.000
- Me, sir? No, sir.

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:24.733
I might give you an earache,
I can see that.

00:25:24.766 --> 00:25:26.766
I talk too much,
always have done.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.633
But the other pain,
the heartburn as it were,

00:25:29.666 --> 00:25:31.733
it's the criminal causing that,
sir, not me.

00:25:31.766 --> 00:25:33.533
- Not short of a quick answer,
either.

00:25:33.566 --> 00:25:36.766
- No, sir, but I didn't
bury the body.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.200
Not guilty to that, sir.

00:25:38.233 --> 00:25:41.366
- Maybe guilty of selling
your eyes for money, eh, sentry?

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.660
Looking the other way for cash?

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.660
- Oh, you're
an intelligent man, sir,

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.166
and well educated, and I'm not.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.866
But in this case,
I'm thinking clearly,

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.100
and you're mistaken.

00:25:51.133 --> 00:25:53.266
- You can think what you like.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.300
Whatever you think,

00:25:55.333 --> 00:25:57.466
if you fail to find
this enemy of the state

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.733
and bring him here to me,

00:25:58.766 --> 00:26:02.366
you'll find that money,
from whatever source,

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.566
will certainly not
save your life.

00:26:11.366 --> 00:26:13.660
- Well, let's hope
they find him then,

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.533
whoever he is.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:25.433
The one thing I'm sure of:
they won't find me.

00:26:25.466 --> 00:26:27.866
I never thought
I'd get out of here alive.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.400
Though when I do get out,

00:26:29.433 --> 00:26:31.766
nothing will
bring me back again.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:32.833
[chuckles]

00:26:32.866 --> 00:26:34.633
I've had an amazing
stroke of luck,

00:26:34.666 --> 00:26:36.700
and I won't chance my harm
a second time.

00:26:44.266 --> 00:26:47.400
all: Is there anything
more wonderful on Earth,

00:26:47.433 --> 00:26:49.533
our marvelous planet,

00:26:49.566 --> 00:26:51.666
than the miracle of man?

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.266
- With an arrogant ease,
he rides the dangerous seas

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:59.733
from the wave's towering summit
to the yawning trough beneath.

00:26:59.766 --> 00:27:03.200
- The earth mother herself
before time began,

00:27:03.233 --> 00:27:05.333
the oldest of the ageless gods,

00:27:05.366 --> 00:27:07.733
learned to endure
his driving plow

00:27:07.766 --> 00:27:10.100
turning the earth
and breaking the clods.

00:27:10.133 --> 00:27:12.666
all: Tilled by the strength
of his brow,

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.700
she yielded up her fruitfulness.

00:27:15.733 --> 00:27:18.400
- The quick-witted birds
are no match for him,

00:27:18.433 --> 00:27:22.100
neither victim nor predator
among the beasts of her plane

00:27:22.133 --> 00:27:24.366
nor the sea's seething masses...

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.700
- His cunning
surpasses their instinct.

00:27:26.733 --> 00:27:28.166
His skill is the greater.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.133
His snares never fail,
and his nets teem.

00:27:31.166 --> 00:27:33.266
- The wild bull
of the savage mountain

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.533
and the magnificent stag

00:27:34.566 --> 00:27:37.766
who passes like a king
through upland and glen...

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.966
- The untamed horse

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.733
with his matted tresses uncut
on his neck...

00:27:40.766 --> 00:27:42.933
all: All submit to man

00:27:42.966 --> 00:27:45.433
and the yoke and the bit,

00:27:45.466 --> 00:27:48.233
and his power increases.

00:27:48.266 --> 00:27:51.133
- He has mastered
the mysteries of language...

00:27:51.166 --> 00:27:52.333
- And thought,

00:27:52.366 --> 00:27:54.233
which moves faster
than the wind he has tamed

00:27:54.266 --> 00:27:55.300
and made rational...

00:27:55.333 --> 00:27:56.533
- Political wisdom too,

00:27:56.566 --> 00:27:58.733
all the knowledge of peoples
and states.

00:27:58.766 --> 00:28:01.466
- All the practical art
of government

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.166
he has studied and refined.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.233
- Built cities
to shelter his head

00:28:05.266 --> 00:28:07.330
against rain and danger
and cold...

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.566
- And ordered all things
in his mind.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.200
- There is no problem
he cannot resolve

00:28:12.233 --> 00:28:15.200
by the exercise of his brains
or his breath.

00:28:15.233 --> 00:28:20.330
- And the only disease
he cannot salve or cure is death.

00:28:23.333 --> 00:28:27.330
all: In action, he is subtle
beyond imagination.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.166
limitless in his skill,

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:33.333
and these gifts
are both enemies and friends,

00:28:33.366 --> 00:28:36.666
as he applies them
with equal determination

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.733
to good or to evil ends.

00:28:39.766 --> 00:28:41.333
- All men honor

00:28:41.366 --> 00:28:45.000
and the state uplifts that man
to the heights of glory

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.766
whose powers
uphold the constitution

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.700
and the gods and their laws.

00:28:50.733 --> 00:28:52.666
His city prospers.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.100
- But if he shifts his ground

00:28:56.133 --> 00:28:58.233
and takes the wrong path,

00:28:58.266 --> 00:29:02.233
despising morality
and blown up with pride,

00:29:02.266 --> 00:29:04.933
indulges himself
and his power...

00:29:04.966 --> 00:29:10.733
all: At my hearth
may he never warm himself

00:29:10.766 --> 00:29:14.166
or sit at my side.

00:29:23.333 --> 00:29:24.333
- But wait.

00:29:24.366 --> 00:29:26.330
- I can't believe my eyes.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.466
- Can this be true?

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.330
- This is Antigone!

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.400
- I recognize her
as clearly as I can see you.

00:29:31.433 --> 00:29:34.833
- Her father's destiny
was suffering and pain.

00:29:34.866 --> 00:29:37.633
- On all his progeny
misfortunes rain.

00:29:37.666 --> 00:29:41.700
- Child, did you openly disobey
the new king's order...

00:29:41.733 --> 00:29:44.666
- And bury your brother?

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.466
- Do you have to manhandle
her this way?

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.766
- We saw it,

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.200
actually burying the body,

00:29:49.233 --> 00:29:51.400
caught him in the act,
as they say, red-handed,

00:29:51.433 --> 00:29:53.133
only it's not a him;

00:29:53.166 --> 00:29:54.533
it's a her.

00:29:54.566 --> 00:29:55.566
Where's the king?

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.633
- He has been informed.

00:29:56.666 --> 00:29:58.766
- He is on his way.

00:30:02.266 --> 00:30:03.766
- Is this a moment
to disturb the king?

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.900
Why do you need me?

00:30:05.933 --> 00:30:06.966
What has happened?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.333
- Lord Creon!

00:30:08.366 --> 00:30:09.900
I reckon it's always unwise

00:30:09.933 --> 00:30:11.466
to swear oaths
and make promises,

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.800
even to yourself.

00:30:12.833 --> 00:30:14.633
Second thoughts,
nine times out of ten,

00:30:14.666 --> 00:30:15.733
will have their say

00:30:15.766 --> 00:30:17.466
and end up
by calling you a liar.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.330
It's no time at all
since I've promised myself

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.733
I wouldn't be seen dead
here again.

00:30:21.766 --> 00:30:23.866
You were angry with me
the last time.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.466
A right mouthful you gave me--

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.166
more than enough,
thanks very much.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.330
But you can't beat a real
turn-up for the book, can you?

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.566
There's nothing more enjoyable
than a good win

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.333
when you're expecting a tousing.

00:30:34.366 --> 00:30:37.466
So here I am again,
as the comic said,

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.333
and my promises not worth
the air they were spoken with.

00:30:41.366 --> 00:30:42.866
This lady's your criminal.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.366
We caught her doing it,

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.566
actually setting the grave
to rights.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.133
I brought her here,

00:30:48.166 --> 00:30:50.800
and there was no panic this time,
I can tell you,

00:30:50.833 --> 00:30:52.400
no retribution or drawing lots.

00:30:52.433 --> 00:30:53.933
She was all mine.

00:30:53.966 --> 00:30:57.330
I caught her,
and I claim the credit for it.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.433
And now she's all yours.

00:30:59.466 --> 00:31:01.500
Take her, and accuse her.

00:31:01.533 --> 00:31:03.333
Stone her to death
if you like.

00:31:03.366 --> 00:31:04.700
I'm free to go, I hope.

00:31:04.733 --> 00:31:08.200
I'm well shot of all of it.

00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:09.833
- Where did you arrest her?

00:31:09.866 --> 00:31:10.900
Tell me the details.

00:31:10.933 --> 00:31:12.333
- She was burying him.

00:31:12.366 --> 00:31:13.366
What else is there to say?

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.330
- Are you out of your mind?

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.300
Do you realize the implications
of what you're saying?

00:31:18.333 --> 00:31:20.666
- Sir, she was
burying the body,

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.666
the body you ordered
not to be buried.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.000
I can't speak plainer than that.

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:25.633
- But how did you catch her?

00:31:25.666 --> 00:31:27.233
Was she doing it openly?

00:31:27.266 --> 00:31:30.166
- Well, gentlemen,
it was like this:

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.600
as soon as I got back,

00:31:31.633 --> 00:31:34.600
remembering all those threats
or promises you made me,

00:31:34.633 --> 00:31:36.933
we brushed all the earth
off the naked body,

00:31:36.966 --> 00:31:39.533
which was all wet
and beginning to decay by now.

00:31:39.566 --> 00:31:41.100
And we sat up on the ridge,

00:31:41.133 --> 00:31:42.700
well to the windward
of the stink,

00:31:42.733 --> 00:31:44.400
and we all kept a sharp eye
on each other,

00:31:44.433 --> 00:31:45.933
ready to nudge anyone
who dropped off

00:31:45.966 --> 00:31:47.700
and tear him off a strip too.

00:31:47.733 --> 00:31:49.366
For hours, we sat there

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:50.966
till about midday.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.766
The Sun was smack overhead
blazing down,

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.266
and the heat was something
terrible, I can tell you.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:00.200
Then suddenly, it was as though
a whirlwind blew up.

00:32:00.233 --> 00:32:01.833
Definitely a twister it was

00:32:01.866 --> 00:32:03.366
but localized, like,

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.566
and it raised up a dust storm
which swept along the valley,

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.533
tore all the leaves
off of the trees,

00:32:08.566 --> 00:32:11.866
blighted out the whole sky,
and completely blinded us.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:15.366
It seemed like some terrible
manifestation of the gods,

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.000
and you had to shut your eyes
to endure it at all.

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:21.200
And then suddenly, it stopped.

00:32:21.233 --> 00:32:23.200
And when the air cleared,

00:32:23.233 --> 00:32:24.966
we opened our eyes

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.900
and saw this girl standing there
beside the grave

00:32:28.933 --> 00:32:31.633
sort of wailing,
as though she were in pain

00:32:31.666 --> 00:32:33.166
or maybe anger,

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.166
just like a bird
that comes back to the nest

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.466
and finds the eggs smashed,
all the fledglings gone.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.800
That's what it sounded like.

00:32:38.833 --> 00:32:42.533
She was standing there
looking at the naked body

00:32:42.566 --> 00:32:45.200
and screaming
and cursing the monsters

00:32:45.233 --> 00:32:46.533
who had done such a thing--

00:32:46.566 --> 00:32:48.100
us, of course.

00:32:48.133 --> 00:32:50.200
Then she crouched down

00:32:50.233 --> 00:32:53.000
and picked up a few handfuls
of the dry dust

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:55.166
and scattered it on him.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.300
She carried an urn,

00:32:56.333 --> 00:32:58.633
a small bronze
ceremonial thing,

00:32:58.666 --> 00:33:02.633
and she poured it
over the dead man three times,

00:33:02.666 --> 00:33:05.233
honey and wine and stuff in it,
I suppose,

00:33:05.266 --> 00:33:07.700
all the proper ritual
for a funeral, anyway.

00:33:07.733 --> 00:33:09.366
Well, as soon as we saw that,

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.833
we all came charging down
and arrested her on the spot.

00:33:12.866 --> 00:33:14.866
She wasn't frightened
or anything.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:17.166
She stood her ground.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.133
So then we formally charged her
with the crime,

00:33:20.166 --> 00:33:22.566
this and the one before.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.733
And she admitted
she'd done them both.

00:33:24.766 --> 00:33:28.133
We were all relieved
to hear that, I can tell you,

00:33:28.166 --> 00:33:30.566
but sorry too in a way.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.660
It's very nice to get
out of trouble yourself,

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:35.133
not so nice
when you see someone else

00:33:35.166 --> 00:33:36.166
up to their neck in it,

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.133
someone you got no quarrel with.

00:33:38.166 --> 00:33:41.800
But still, your own life
comes first, I reckon.

00:33:41.833 --> 00:33:43.833
You've got to look after
number one.

00:33:56.666 --> 00:33:58.433
- And you,

00:33:58.466 --> 00:34:01.700
you, with your head down,

00:34:01.733 --> 00:34:05.633
what do you say
to this accusation, hmm?

00:34:05.666 --> 00:34:08.166
You admit it?
You guilty or not?

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.900
- Yes.

00:34:09.933 --> 00:34:12.330
I'm guilty.

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:15.533
I don't pretend otherwise.

00:34:15.566 --> 00:34:16.766
- You, soldier, get out.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.433
You're free
to go back to your unit.

00:34:18.466 --> 00:34:20.266
Count yourself lucky.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:30.700
Now, tell me
a simple yes or no.

00:34:30.733 --> 00:34:32.633
Did you hear of my order
forbidding the burial?

00:34:32.666 --> 00:34:34.000
- Of course I heard it.

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:35.330
How could I not?

00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:37.000
- Yet you dared
to disobey the law.

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:38.733
- Yes, I did,

00:34:38.766 --> 00:34:42.866
because it's your law,
not the law of God,

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.266
natural justice,

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.566
which is of all times
and places numinous,

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.900
not material,
a quality of Zeus, not of kings,

00:34:50.933 --> 00:34:54.533
recognizes no such law.

00:34:54.566 --> 00:34:56.566
You are merely a man,

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.833
mortal, like me.

00:34:58.866 --> 00:35:00.800
And laws that you enact
cannot overturn

00:35:00.833 --> 00:35:03.766
ancient moralities
or common human decency.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.566
They speak
the language of eternity,

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.833
are not written down,
and never change.

00:35:09.866 --> 00:35:14.933
They are for today, yesterday,
and all time.

00:35:14.966 --> 00:35:16.933
No one understands
where they came from,

00:35:16.966 --> 00:35:18.900
but everyone
recognizes their force,

00:35:18.933 --> 00:35:22.400
and no man's arrogance or power
can make me disobey them.

00:35:26.766 --> 00:35:28.266
I would rather suffer
the disapproval

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.300
and punishment of men

00:35:29.333 --> 00:35:34.533
than dishonor
such ancient truths.

00:35:34.566 --> 00:35:37.330
I shall die,
of course, sometime,

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:38.566
whether you make laws or not.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.400
If my death comes
sooner rather than later,

00:35:40.433 --> 00:35:41.466
I shall welcome it.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.900
My life has been misery.

00:35:42.933 --> 00:35:46.266
It is misery now, and I shall be
more than happy to leave it.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:50.833
There will be no pain
and no despair in that.

00:35:50.866 --> 00:35:54.100
But to leave my mother's son

00:35:54.133 --> 00:35:56.566
out there in the open

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:01.266
unburied,

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.500
that would have been
unendurable.

00:36:04.533 --> 00:36:07.600
I could not have borne it,

00:36:07.633 --> 00:36:12.000
whereas this I shall endure.

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:15.166
By your judgment, of course,
I'm a fool,

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.400
but by mine,
the judge is the criminal,

00:36:17.433 --> 00:36:19.833
not the accused.

00:36:19.866 --> 00:36:22.400
- This is her father talking.

00:36:22.433 --> 00:36:25.266
- Stubborn; like him,
she won't give way.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.966
- Not even with the whole power
of the state against her.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.833
- Well, we shall see.

00:36:30.866 --> 00:36:33.266
Any man can be broken,

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:37.600
and often the most committed
and determined break soonest.

00:36:37.633 --> 00:36:40.330
Even iron, you know,
left lying in the fire too long,

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:42.660
becomes over tempered
and will snap.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.633
As soon as a little pressure
is applied,

00:36:43.666 --> 00:36:46.000
you can break it in pieces.

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:49.660
The wildest horse, in the end,

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:54.900
submits to the bit and halter
just like the rest.

00:36:54.933 --> 00:36:57.766
People without power,

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.800
ordinary citizens,

00:36:59.833 --> 00:37:03.833
must necessarily obey
those in authority over them.

00:37:03.866 --> 00:37:05.466
This woman is very proud.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.900
That was obvious
in the first place

00:37:06.933 --> 00:37:07.933
when she broke the law

00:37:07.966 --> 00:37:10.566
and is even clearer now.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.700
She glories in the crime
she has committed

00:37:13.733 --> 00:37:15.400
and insults me to my face

00:37:15.433 --> 00:37:18.733
as well as ignoring my decree.

00:37:18.766 --> 00:37:22.233
If she is allowed
to flout the law in this way,

00:37:22.266 --> 00:37:24.166
all authority in the state
will collapse.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.533
I will not have that.

00:37:26.566 --> 00:37:28.600
There will be no
exchanging of roles here,

00:37:28.633 --> 00:37:31.333
me playing the woman
while she plays the king.

00:37:31.366 --> 00:37:33.466
She is my niece,
my sister's child,

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.533
but I am the law,

00:37:36.566 --> 00:37:39.466
and that responsibility
is above kinship.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.633
Were she even closer,
the closest, my own daughter,

00:37:41.666 --> 00:37:43.900
my duty would be plain.

00:37:43.933 --> 00:37:46.233
Well,

00:37:46.266 --> 00:37:49.100
the law has its weapons,

00:37:49.133 --> 00:37:53.966
and they will strike at her

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.600
and at her sister too,
her accomplice, I have no doubt,

00:37:56.633 --> 00:37:57.900
in this illegal act,

00:37:57.933 --> 00:38:00.566
to the full extent
of the punishment prescribed.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.833
The other one, Ismene,
bring her here.

00:38:02.866 --> 00:38:04.233
I saw her in the corridor

00:38:04.266 --> 00:38:06.533
talking to herself
some moments ago

00:38:06.566 --> 00:38:09.233
and, I suppose, in tears.

00:38:09.266 --> 00:38:12.166
Guilty consciences, you see,
can never be hidden completely.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.466
The human face
reveals conspiracies

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.000
before they are enacted
again and again.

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:19.666
There's nothing more disgusting

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:23.333
than the confessed criminal
who tries to justify his actions

00:38:23.366 --> 00:38:26.233
as this woman has done
here today.

00:38:26.266 --> 00:38:28.500
- I'm bored with your talk.

00:38:28.533 --> 00:38:30.466
Kill me and have done with it!

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.300
- Well, there's no hurry.

00:38:32.333 --> 00:38:36.000
The progress of the law
is majestic and inexorable.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:37.700
And that satisfies me.

00:38:37.733 --> 00:38:39.700
- Why waste so much time?

00:38:39.733 --> 00:38:42.330
Nothing you say will be
of the slightest interest to me,

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.000
and my arguments
you will not listen to.

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:45.500
I've done what I said I'd do.

00:38:45.533 --> 00:38:48.660
I've buried my brother.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.100
I aspire to no greater honor.

00:38:50.133 --> 00:38:53.660
And if I am to be famous,

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.330
let it be for that.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:57.633
All these,
these senators of yours,

00:38:57.666 --> 00:38:59.166
they all agree with me
in their hearts.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.200
But there's no gag like terror,
is there, gentlemen?

00:39:02.233 --> 00:39:04.966
And kings must have their way,
both in word and action

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.330
one way or the other.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.500
- You're quite mistaken.

00:39:07.533 --> 00:39:10.533
None of my subjects anywhere
in the city thinks as you do.

00:39:10.566 --> 00:39:12.366
- They all do, but they're
too afraid to speak.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.800
- Not at all,
and you should be ashamed,

00:39:13.833 --> 00:39:15.500
setting yourself up
against the majority,

00:39:15.533 --> 00:39:16.966
disregarding the will
of the people.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
- I love my brother.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:19.100
I honor him dead
as I loved him living.

00:39:19.133 --> 00:39:20.300
There's no shame in that.

00:39:20.333 --> 00:39:21.766
- The one he murdered,
wasn't he your brother?

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.700
- My mother bore them both,
and I loved them both.

00:39:23.733 --> 00:39:25.300
- If you honor one,
you insult the other.

00:39:25.333 --> 00:39:27.000
- Neither of those dead men
would say that.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:28.366
- Eteocles would.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.766
His brother was a traitor.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.433
Does he merit no greater respect
than that?

00:39:31.466 --> 00:39:33.933
- But he was not an animal.

00:39:33.966 --> 00:39:36.433
They both died together,
and they were both men.

00:39:36.466 --> 00:39:38.330
- Yeah, the one died
defending his country,

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:39.733
while the other
traitorously attacked it.

00:39:39.766 --> 00:39:41.166
- The dead have their rights,

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.600
and we have our duties towards them
dictated by common decency.

00:39:43.633 --> 00:39:45.433
- And if good and bad
are to be honored equally,

00:39:45.466 --> 00:39:47.633
where are our values,
patriotism, civic duty?

00:39:47.666 --> 00:39:49.800
- Death is another country.

00:39:49.833 --> 00:39:52.400
Such things may not be valued there,
may even be crimes.

00:39:52.433 --> 00:39:54.400
- An enemy is still an enemy,
dead or alive.

00:39:54.433 --> 00:39:55.700
- No.

00:39:55.733 --> 00:39:57.733
I don't think so.

00:39:57.766 --> 00:40:00.330
I have love enough to share,

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:01.266
no hate for anyone.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.366
- Very well, share your love,
by all means.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.400
Share it with the dead.

00:40:04.433 --> 00:40:07.330
I wish them well of it.

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:10.500
Women must learn to obey
as well as men.

00:40:10.533 --> 00:40:13.166
They can have
no special treatment.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.966
Law is law

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.266
and will remain so
while I am king.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.733
And no woman
will get the better of me.

00:40:22.766 --> 00:40:26.966
[loud grinding noise]

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000
- Look, senators!
- Ismene!

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:29.330
- Guard ye!

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:30.700
- Her face is raw with tears.

00:40:30.733 --> 00:40:32.566
- Half dragged
from her quarters.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.200
- You can see the story
in her face.

00:40:34.233 --> 00:40:35.533
- A lifetime of agonies...

00:40:35.566 --> 00:40:36.800
- And fears.

00:40:36.833 --> 00:40:40.466
- The bitter legacy
of Oedipus' daughters.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.566
- [whimpers]

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.900
- And you, snake,

00:40:43.933 --> 00:40:46.200
slithering silently
about my house

00:40:46.233 --> 00:40:47.966
to drink my blood in secret.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.766
Both of you the same.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.466
I looked the other way,
and like terrorists,

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:57.166
you laid undercover plans
to destroy me.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.633
You.

00:40:58.666 --> 00:41:00.533
Do you confess
your complicity in this crime

00:41:00.566 --> 00:41:02.766
or protest your innocence?

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.330
- Yes.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:05.433
I confess,

00:41:05.466 --> 00:41:07.666
if she will allow me to say so.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.500
I was fully involved,
and if she is guilty, so am I.

00:41:10.533 --> 00:41:12.000
- No!

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:14.133
That isn't justice!

00:41:14.166 --> 00:41:15.933
When I asked for help,
you refused me,

00:41:15.966 --> 00:41:17.700
so I told you I didn't want you;
I'd do it alone.

00:41:17.733 --> 00:41:19.233
- But now that you're
in danger, Antigone,

00:41:19.266 --> 00:41:20.833
I'm proud to stand beside you
in the dock.

00:41:20.866 --> 00:41:22.366
- The dead man
knows who buried him.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.733
They all know down there.

00:41:23.766 --> 00:41:25.866
What people say doesn't
impress me, only what they do.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.300
- Please, my sister,
don't despise me.

00:41:28.333 --> 00:41:30.333
Let me share the honor
and die with you.

00:41:30.366 --> 00:41:31.766
- You've no right
to claim the honor

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.966
for doing
what you were afraid to do!

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.866
One death will be enough.
Why should you die?

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.766
- Because I can't live
without you.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.966
- Ask Creon to help you.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.900
He's your uncle
and your king, of course.

00:41:40.933 --> 00:41:42.000
You're a born subject.

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:44.266
- Do I deserve such contempt?

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.566
Do you enjoy making fun of me,

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.733
sneering in front
of all these people?

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.366
- You're right.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.800
It's a sad reflection on me

00:41:57.833 --> 00:41:59.933
if such bitter pleasures
are all I have left.

00:41:59.966 --> 00:42:01.933
- Well, let me help you, then.
It's not too late.

00:42:01.966 --> 00:42:03.966
- Save your own life.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.900
Do that for yourself without
any criticism from me or envy.

00:42:06.933 --> 00:42:09.660
- For God's sake, Antigone,

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.600
will you not let me even die
with my sister?

00:42:11.633 --> 00:42:12.700
- No, I won't.

00:42:12.733 --> 00:42:14.333
You chose to live
when I chose to die,

00:42:14.366 --> 00:42:15.833
and that's the end of it.

00:42:15.866 --> 00:42:17.300
- But I warned you
this would happen.

00:42:17.333 --> 00:42:18.566
I knew how it would be.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.400
- And most, the majority
would agree with you,

00:42:20.433 --> 00:42:21.633
but some would be of my opinion.

00:42:21.666 --> 00:42:23.433
- But now we're both accused,
both sentenced.

00:42:23.466 --> 00:42:27.300
- No.
You must live!

00:42:27.333 --> 00:42:29.700
I have been dead
for a long time inwardly.

00:42:29.733 --> 00:42:32.466
I am well suited to pay honor
to the dead and die for it.

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.366
- These women
are neurotic lunatics,

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.533
both of them,

00:42:35.566 --> 00:42:37.333
one of them going off her head
before our eyes,

00:42:37.366 --> 00:42:38.966
the other one born unbalanced.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.300
- Well, are you surprised?

00:42:40.333 --> 00:42:42.333
Anyone would crack the most
tough-minded person

00:42:42.366 --> 00:42:43.566
under such treatment.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.500
- You lost your senses
when you allowed yourself

00:42:45.533 --> 00:42:46.700
to be influenced by her lunacy.

00:42:46.733 --> 00:42:48.900
- There's no life for me here,
not without her.

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:51.200
- She's not here.
She's as good as dead.

00:42:51.233 --> 00:42:53.466
- Will you kill the woman
your son plans to marry?

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.500
- There are other women,

00:42:54.533 --> 00:42:56.666
no lack of choice
for a young man,

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.666
other fields to plow.

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.366
- They're devoted
to each other.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.333
You can't change love
as you change your clothes.

00:43:02.366 --> 00:43:04.566
- No son of mine
can marry a criminal.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.733
- When Haemon hears
how his father insults--

00:43:06.766 --> 00:43:07.800
- Let him hear!

00:43:07.833 --> 00:43:09.233
What does his mistress
matter to me?

00:43:09.266 --> 00:43:11.766
- My lord Creon,
you insult your own.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.633
They are formally betrothed.

00:43:13.666 --> 00:43:16.000
- Will you tear the woman
from your own son's arms?

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:17.600
- I will not part them.

00:43:17.633 --> 00:43:20.300
Death will.

00:43:20.333 --> 00:43:22.866
- If that's how the land lies,

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.500
the poor child's doomed.

00:43:24.533 --> 00:43:27.100
- Her death warrant
sealed and delivered.

00:43:27.133 --> 00:43:29.266
- By you, gentlemen,
if you remember,

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.566
as well as by me.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.500
You heard the order,
agreed it with me,

00:43:33.533 --> 00:43:35.266
if only by your silence,
did you not,

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.900
before the criminal was known?

00:43:37.933 --> 00:43:39.666
We'll have no more
shilly-shallying.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:40.833
Take them away.
Lock them up.

00:43:40.866 --> 00:43:42.500
Keep them under close guard.

00:43:42.533 --> 00:43:45.200
It's time they understood
they are women

00:43:45.233 --> 00:43:47.833
and their proper place
in this society.

00:43:47.866 --> 00:43:49.866
There's nothing like
the immediate threat of death

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.433
to soften up their rhetoric,

00:43:51.466 --> 00:43:53.766
make them look reality
in the face.

00:44:07.933 --> 00:44:10.233
all: They can
call themselves lucky,

00:44:10.266 --> 00:44:12.660
the fortunate few

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.866
who live their lives through,

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:17.333
never drinking
from the bitter cup of pain.

00:44:17.366 --> 00:44:21.333
- But when one unlucky family
incurs the gods' malignity

00:44:21.366 --> 00:44:23.966
from generation to generation,

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.466
they must swallow
the bitter potion

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.933
again and again.

00:44:28.966 --> 00:44:31.900
- Just as rollers crash
and sea spray whips

00:44:31.933 --> 00:44:35.133
on an exposed beach
and black clouds lower...

00:44:35.166 --> 00:44:38.633
- And the gale from the north
screams through frozen lips

00:44:38.666 --> 00:44:40.733
while the sea
casts up from its depths

00:44:40.766 --> 00:44:42.400
a shower of pebbles
on the shore...

00:44:42.433 --> 00:44:45.666
- And black sand
from the chasms of the ocean

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:47.866
darkens the strand.

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:51.766
- On every descendant
of the ancient line of Labdacus,

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.900
divine and merciless
retribution falls.

00:44:54.933 --> 00:44:56.733
- In the unremembered past,

00:44:56.766 --> 00:44:58.333
some unforgiving Olympian

00:44:58.366 --> 00:45:01.200
cast the weight of his vengeance
on the whole race...

00:45:01.233 --> 00:45:03.966
- So that agony,
destruction, disgrace

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
destroys son and daughter

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.300
and darkens their halls
with tragedy.

00:45:08.333 --> 00:45:11.333
- The cold hands of the dead
reach out for the living,

00:45:11.366 --> 00:45:12.900
and no one is spared.

00:45:12.933 --> 00:45:15.366
- Another generation
sheds its blood.

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.233
New light is snuffed out

00:45:17.266 --> 00:45:20.766
and the young root bared
for the same bloody ax.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:25.330
- The characteristic sin
of Oedipus, arrogance,

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.733
brings its bleak harvest in.

00:45:27.766 --> 00:45:30.700
all: For Zeus is all-powerful.

00:45:30.733 --> 00:45:32.866
No man can match him.

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:36.660
He never sleeps
as man must sleep.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.766
- And time,
which leaves its mark

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.533
on fair complexions and dark,

00:45:41.566 --> 00:45:44.000
can never engrave his face...

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:46.766
- Or dim the brightness
of his palace

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.566
where the gods
keep their ageless court

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:53.000
at the utmost peak
of sublime Olympus.

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:55.366
- Zeus is master there.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.833
- And well do
the wise men speak

00:45:57.866 --> 00:46:00.233
who say
that past and future time

00:46:00.266 --> 00:46:02.500
he holds in his hand
by rights.

00:46:02.533 --> 00:46:06.533
- And that those who climb
in their greatness or wickedness

00:46:06.566 --> 00:46:08.433
beyond the permitted height

00:46:08.466 --> 00:46:13.700
he brings to destruction
and despair.

00:46:13.733 --> 00:46:15.300
- But all men hope...

00:46:15.333 --> 00:46:17.500
- And some have ambition.

00:46:17.533 --> 00:46:20.133
- Far-ranging birds
that never tire...

00:46:20.166 --> 00:46:23.400
- Whose wings bear some
to their own good...

00:46:23.433 --> 00:46:25.566
- And others
in a more frivolous mood...

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:29.300
- To the brightly lit pathway
that leads to destruction...

00:46:29.333 --> 00:46:30.533
- And disaster...

00:46:30.566 --> 00:46:32.400
- And the merciless fire.

00:46:32.433 --> 00:46:36.330
- And no man can claim to have
understood hope or ambition

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.533
till the flames
burn under his feet.

00:46:38.566 --> 00:46:40.433
- And the one solid wood
of his life

00:46:40.466 --> 00:46:43.700
is reduced
to its last condition:

00:46:43.733 --> 00:46:47.330
ashes and dust.

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:48.566
- A wise man said

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.866
from out of the depths
of his inspiration...

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.300
- When a man commits crimes

00:46:53.333 --> 00:46:56.433
and is proud of the action,

00:46:56.466 --> 00:46:59.833
a flaming sword
hangs over his head.

00:46:59.866 --> 00:47:01.600
all: No future

00:47:01.633 --> 00:47:03.733
but the grave

00:47:03.766 --> 00:47:06.466
and the funeral urn.

00:47:13.433 --> 00:47:16.333
- Creon,
here comes your youngest son,

00:47:16.366 --> 00:47:17.600
desperate with grief...

00:47:17.633 --> 00:47:20.100
- That his future bride
should be so brutally denied...

00:47:20.133 --> 00:47:22.330
- And all his hopes
of happiness gone.

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:23.533
- For the last of your sons,

00:47:23.566 --> 00:47:25.633
what relief
from his consuming fears

00:47:25.666 --> 00:47:27.660
and the bitter penance of tears?

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:29.333
- Has he come
to beg for mercy...

00:47:29.366 --> 00:47:31.660
- For his beloved Antigone?

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:33.000
- We shall learn that
from his own lips,

00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:35.500
without any need
of fortune-tellers.

00:47:50.466 --> 00:47:52.233
My dear son,

00:47:52.266 --> 00:47:56.500
I don't doubt you've heard
the news of our final decision:

00:47:56.533 --> 00:47:58.900
the condemnation
of your former fiancee.

00:47:58.933 --> 00:48:00.233
You come here, I hope,

00:48:00.266 --> 00:48:03.300
not in any spirit of anger
against your father

00:48:03.333 --> 00:48:07.133
but understanding
that we are always comrades

00:48:07.166 --> 00:48:12.100
and my love for you is unshaken.

00:48:12.133 --> 00:48:15.300
- I know I'm your son,
father.

00:48:15.333 --> 00:48:17.330
I understand
the depth of your experience

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:18.366
in matters of state,

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.933
and I try to follow
and to benefit from it

00:48:19.966 --> 00:48:21.566
whenever I can.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.500
Any marriage
would be worthless to me

00:48:23.533 --> 00:48:27.600
that didn't have
your approval and love.

00:48:27.633 --> 00:48:29.700
- Good fellow.

00:48:29.733 --> 00:48:31.266
Well said.

00:48:36.433 --> 00:48:41.900
A father's opinion should always
be influential with his sons.

00:48:41.933 --> 00:48:44.366
And fathers with young sons,
when they pray for them

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.333
ask especially
that they should grow up

00:48:46.366 --> 00:48:48.566
to be loyal, reliable, obedient,

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.433
the first to strike
at their father's enemies

00:48:50.466 --> 00:48:53.660
just as they are the first
to support his friends.

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.600
A father whose sons
yield no such profits

00:48:55.633 --> 00:48:57.733
from the investment
of his parenthood

00:48:57.766 --> 00:48:59.766
breeds grief and sorrow
as his offspring

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.800
and becomes himself
a figure of fun,

00:49:02.833 --> 00:49:08.660
especially to his enemies.

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:10.300
Don't be taken in, boy.

00:49:10.333 --> 00:49:12.300
Don't let any woman
ensnare you

00:49:12.333 --> 00:49:15.233
by exploiting her sexuality
or any of the attractions

00:49:15.266 --> 00:49:18.300
that lure infatuated men
into submission.

00:49:18.333 --> 00:49:21.800
God help the lovesick fool
who marries a dominating woman.

00:49:21.833 --> 00:49:24.166
Passion never lasts,

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.800
and a cold bedroom
breeds cold hearts,

00:49:26.833 --> 00:49:28.833
anger, and bitterness,

00:49:28.866 --> 00:49:30.300
for there's no hatred so violent

00:49:30.333 --> 00:49:35.233
as the hatred of two people
who were once in love.

00:49:35.266 --> 00:49:37.300
Get rid of her, my boy.

00:49:37.333 --> 00:49:38.433
This girl's an enemy,

00:49:38.466 --> 00:49:39.900
no good to you
or your best interests.

00:49:39.933 --> 00:49:41.366
Kick her out.

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.660
Let her find herself a husband
that suits her among the dead.

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:47.133
Don't deceive yourself.

00:49:47.166 --> 00:49:48.566
She has been openly apprehended

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:50.433
performing a criminal act
against the state.

00:49:50.466 --> 00:49:52.233
She's a confessed traitor,

00:49:52.266 --> 00:49:53.733
and if I were to spare her life,

00:49:53.766 --> 00:49:56.700
I too would betray
the state and its law

00:49:56.733 --> 00:50:00.100
and everything I stand for.

00:50:00.133 --> 00:50:02.333
I will not do it,

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:05.233
and she must die.

00:50:05.266 --> 00:50:07.500
Let her pray to Zeus
till she drops.

00:50:07.533 --> 00:50:09.800
Let her assert
she stands for family love

00:50:09.833 --> 00:50:11.933
and ancient virtues
and all the rest of it.

00:50:11.966 --> 00:50:15.333
If I tolerate treachery in
my own house under my very nose,

00:50:15.366 --> 00:50:18.966
how can I crush subversion
anywhere else in the city

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.566
or in the state at large?

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.733
The man who rules wisely
within his own family

00:50:24.766 --> 00:50:26.800
is more likely
to make sensible judgments

00:50:26.833 --> 00:50:29.633
in political matters
in his direction of the state.

00:50:29.666 --> 00:50:31.400
To pervert the law,

00:50:31.433 --> 00:50:33.433
to twist it
to serve one's own ends

00:50:33.466 --> 00:50:35.200
or the interests
of one's relations,

00:50:35.233 --> 00:50:36.900
that cannot be allowed

00:50:36.933 --> 00:50:39.633
neither in states nor in cities

00:50:39.666 --> 00:50:41.133
and will not be allowed

00:50:41.166 --> 00:50:45.666
by me in any circumstances.

00:50:47.433 --> 00:50:49.233
Unquestioning obedience

00:50:49.266 --> 00:50:52.330
to whomsoever the state appoints
to be its ruler

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:55.366
is the law,
as far as I'm concerned.

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.566
And this applies to small things
as well as great ones,

00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:59.600
just or unjust, right or wrong.

00:50:59.633 --> 00:51:04.660
For who is to choose
these things but the king?

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:07.133
The man who is wise
in his direction of his family

00:51:07.166 --> 00:51:10.300
will be equally firm in power.

00:51:10.333 --> 00:51:12.566
His wisdom
will be equally remarkable

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:15.400
whether as king or, indeed,
as subject.

00:51:15.433 --> 00:51:18.330
In times of war
and national danger,

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:19.533
he will be the man
you can rely on,

00:51:19.566 --> 00:51:21.633
the man you feel safe with
fighting beside you

00:51:21.666 --> 00:51:23.700
in the front rank when
the battle becomes critical.

00:51:23.733 --> 00:51:27.500
Indiscipline, anarchy,
disobedience:

00:51:27.533 --> 00:51:30.300
what greater scourge than that
for humankind?

00:51:30.333 --> 00:51:33.800
States collapse from within,
cities are blown to rubble,

00:51:33.833 --> 00:51:35.366
efficient armies
are disorganized,

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.100
a potential victory
turned to disaster and carnage,

00:51:38.133 --> 00:51:40.866
and all by disobedience,
anarchy, indiscipline,

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:46.500
whereas the well-conditioned
army that asks no questions

00:51:46.533 --> 00:51:51.330
stands firm, knows nothing,
needs to know nothing, and wins,

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:55.533
thus saving the lives
of millions of honest people.

00:51:55.566 --> 00:52:00.833
Authority is essential
in any state

00:52:00.866 --> 00:52:05.433
and will be upheld
in this one by me.

00:52:05.466 --> 00:52:08.966
There will be no yielding
to female fantasies,

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.330
not by so much as an inch.

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:13.933
And if we must be deposed,

00:52:13.966 --> 00:52:17.433
let it be by a man's hand,
eh, son,

00:52:17.466 --> 00:52:20.633
not by a conspiracy of women.

00:52:29.133 --> 00:52:33.166
- If an old man
is fit to be judge, Lord Creon,

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:36.933
you have spoken rationally,
sensibly,

00:52:36.966 --> 00:52:40.966
and with the wisdom
gathered from long experience.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.933
- Father,

00:52:42.966 --> 00:52:44.766
the most enviable
of a man's gifts

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.766
is the ability
to reason clearly.

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.330
And it's not for me
to say you're wrong,

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.660
even if I were clever enough
or experienced enough,

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:52.600
which I'm not,

00:52:52.633 --> 00:52:53.866
but it's also true to say

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:56.600
that some men think differently
about these things.

00:52:56.633 --> 00:52:59.333
And as your son, my most useful
function, it seems to me,

00:52:59.366 --> 00:53:01.666
is to keep you in touch with
what other people are thinking,

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.766
what they say and do
and approve or disapprove of

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:07.200
and sometimes
what they leave unsaid.

00:53:07.233 --> 00:53:08.766
The prospect of your disapproval

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.900
is a great silencer
of most men's tongues,

00:53:10.933 --> 00:53:13.333
and some things are never said
for fear of the consequences.

00:53:13.366 --> 00:53:14.666
But I can sometimes hear

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:17.833
what people whisper
behind their hands,

00:53:17.866 --> 00:53:21.366
and everywhere
I hear sympathy expressed

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.933
for this unfortunate girl,

00:53:22.966 --> 00:53:25.433
condemned as she is
to a horrifying death

00:53:25.466 --> 00:53:28.966
which no woman
has ever suffered before

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.466
and unjustly

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.533
in most people's eyes.

00:53:32.566 --> 00:53:35.900
In burying her brother
who was killed in action,

00:53:35.933 --> 00:53:38.133
she did something
that most people consider

00:53:38.166 --> 00:53:39.866
decent and honorable

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.200
rather than leaving him
naked on the battlefield

00:53:42.233 --> 00:53:43.433
for the dogs to tear at

00:53:43.466 --> 00:53:45.633
and kites and scavengers
to pick to the bone.

00:53:45.666 --> 00:53:48.266
She should be given a medal
for it, those same people say,

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.233
and her name inscribed
on the roll of honor.

00:53:51.266 --> 00:53:53.733
These things are whispered
in secret, father,

00:53:53.766 --> 00:53:57.366
and they've reached my ears.

00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:01.733
Sir, your reputation
matters to me

00:54:01.766 --> 00:54:03.933
as much as your good health
and happiness does.

00:54:03.966 --> 00:54:06.133
Indeed, your good name
matters more.

00:54:06.166 --> 00:54:08.433
What could a loving son
be more jealous of

00:54:08.466 --> 00:54:09.666
than his father's reputation?

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.660
And what could
please a father more

00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:12.600
than to see his son's concern

00:54:12.633 --> 00:54:14.566
that people
will think well of him?

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:18.600
And let me beg you
to have second thoughts

00:54:18.633 --> 00:54:20.633
and not be certain
that your own opinion

00:54:20.666 --> 00:54:24.566
is the only right one
and that all men share it.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.833
The man who thinks
he has the monopoly of wisdom

00:54:26.866 --> 00:54:29.633
and only what he says and what
he thinks is of any relevance

00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:31.133
reveals his own
shallowness of mind

00:54:31.166 --> 00:54:32.533
with every word he says.

00:54:32.566 --> 00:54:35.366
The man of judgment
knows it's a sign of strength,

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.660
not weakness,
to value others' opinions

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.533
and to learn from them

00:54:39.566 --> 00:54:41.133
and when he's wrong,

00:54:41.166 --> 00:54:46.533
to admit it openly
and change his mind.

00:54:46.566 --> 00:54:48.433
You see it when a river floods.

00:54:48.466 --> 00:54:50.800
The trees that bend survive.

00:54:50.833 --> 00:54:52.466
Those whose trunks
are inflexible

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.666
are snapped off short
by the weight of water.

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:56.233
And a sailor in a storm

00:54:56.266 --> 00:54:59.660
who refuses to reef his sail
and run with the wind

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:01.233
is likely to end up capsized.

00:55:01.266 --> 00:55:04.566
I beg you, father;

00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.566
think twice about this.

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.700
Don't let your anger
influence you.

00:55:09.733 --> 00:55:12.100
If a man of my age
may lay some small claim

00:55:12.133 --> 00:55:13.500
to common sense,
let me say this:

00:55:13.533 --> 00:55:15.166
absolute certainty is fine

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:20.000
if a man can be certain
that his wisdom is absolute.

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:25.633
But such certainty and such
wisdom is rare among men,

00:55:25.666 --> 00:55:26.733
and that being so,

00:55:26.766 --> 00:55:30.900
the next best
is to learn to listen

00:55:30.933 --> 00:55:34.400
and to take good advice
when it's offered.

00:55:34.433 --> 00:55:37.100
- There's a lot of sense,
my lord Creon,

00:55:37.133 --> 00:55:38.900
in what this young man has said,

00:55:38.933 --> 00:55:42.660
as indeed there was
in everything that you said too.

00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:43.733
The fact is,
you are both in the right,

00:55:43.766 --> 00:55:45.866
and there's a good deal
to be said for either.

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:49.566
- Is there indeed?

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.333
Am I expected to listen
and take lessons

00:55:52.366 --> 00:55:55.166
in political tactics
at my age from a mere boy?

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.533
- I'm a man, Father,

00:55:56.566 --> 00:55:59.200
and my arguments stand
upon their merits, not my age.

00:55:59.233 --> 00:56:01.800
I am for common justice,
no more than that.

00:56:01.833 --> 00:56:04.500
- Oh, they stand
upon their merits, do they?

00:56:04.533 --> 00:56:06.433
For what merit is there,
please tell me,

00:56:06.466 --> 00:56:07.866
in breaking the law?

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.766
- I wouldn't defend her
if she'd broken the law.

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.866
- But she has broken it,
openly, flagrantly!

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:14.666
- Listen to the people
in the streets, Father,

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.330
the ordinary Thebans.

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:17.233
They say she has not!

00:56:17.266 --> 00:56:19.366
- I have never
based my political principles

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:21.330
on the opinions
of people in the streets!

00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:22.866
- Now you're the one
who's speaking like a boy.

00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:24.233
- I am speaking like a king!

00:56:24.266 --> 00:56:25.533
It is my decision!

00:56:25.566 --> 00:56:27.233
I will act
according to my own convictions.

00:56:27.266 --> 00:56:29.100
- When the state
becomes one man,

00:56:29.133 --> 00:56:30.400
it ceases to be a state.

00:56:30.433 --> 00:56:32.500
- The state
is the statesman who rules it.

00:56:32.533 --> 00:56:33.633
It reflects his judgment.

00:56:33.666 --> 00:56:34.666
It belongs to him!

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:35.933
- Go and rule
in the desert, then.

00:56:35.966 --> 00:56:36.966
There's no one there
to argue with you.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.166
What a king you'll be there!

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.333
- This boy of mine
is on the women's side.

00:56:40.366 --> 00:56:42.466
- Yes, if you're a woman, I am.

00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:44.700
I'm on your side, Father.
You know that.

00:56:44.733 --> 00:56:46.766
- You damned impertinent devil!

00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:48.733
Every word you say
is against me, your own father.

00:56:48.766 --> 00:56:50.400
- When I know you're wrong,
I have to speak.

00:56:50.433 --> 00:56:51.433
- How am I wrong?

00:56:51.466 --> 00:56:52.633
By maintaining my position

00:56:52.666 --> 00:56:54.400
on the authority of the state;
is that wrong?

00:56:54.433 --> 00:56:55.800
- When position and authority

00:56:55.833 --> 00:56:57.366
ride roughshod of a moral field.

00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.733
- You're weak and uxorious
and contemptible,

00:56:59.766 --> 00:57:01.100
with no will of your own.

00:57:01.133 --> 00:57:02.433
You're a woman's mouthpiece!

00:57:02.466 --> 00:57:03.966
- I'm not ashamed
of what I'm saying.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.566
- Every word you've said
pleads for her.

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:07.500
- I plead for you

00:57:07.533 --> 00:57:11.866
and for myself
and for common humanity,

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:13.800
respect for the dead.

00:57:13.833 --> 00:57:16.330
- You will never marry
that woman, never,

00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:17.766
not this side of the grave.

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.133
- If she dies,
she won't die alone.

00:57:20.166 --> 00:57:22.600
There will be two deaths,
not one.

00:57:22.633 --> 00:57:24.433
- Are you threatening me?

00:57:24.466 --> 00:57:25.866
How dare you threaten me!

00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:27.330
- No, that's not a threat.

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:28.700
I'm telling you
your plan was misbegotten

00:57:28.733 --> 00:57:29.766
from the beginning.

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.233
- Misbegotten!

00:57:31.266 --> 00:57:32.833
Dear God, if anything's
misbegotten here, it's my son!

00:57:32.866 --> 00:57:34.333
You'll regret this,
I promise you.

00:57:34.366 --> 00:57:36.466
- If you weren't my father,
I'd say you were demented.

00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:37.766
- Don't "father" me!

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.566
You're a woman's plaything,
a tame lapdog.

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.966
- Is anyone else
allowed to speak?

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.866
Must you have the last word
in everything?

00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:47.933
Must all the rest of us
be gagged?

00:57:47.966 --> 00:57:51.660
- I must, and I will.

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:52.766
And you, I promise
you will regret

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.233
what you've spoken here today.

00:57:54.266 --> 00:57:59.100
I will not be sneered at
or contradicted by anyone.

00:57:59.133 --> 00:58:01.500
Sons can be punished too.

00:58:01.533 --> 00:58:04.166
Bring her out, the condemned woman,
the criminal.

00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:07.566
Let her die here and now
in front of him,

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.900
this passionate bridegroom
of hers.

00:58:10.933 --> 00:58:13.833
You can watch the execution.

00:58:15.866 --> 00:58:19.660
- That's one sight
I shall never see,

00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:23.733
nor from this moment, Father,

00:58:23.766 --> 00:58:25.433
will you ever see me again.

00:58:30.133 --> 00:58:31.566
Those that wish to stay
and watch

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:35.700
this disgusting spectacle
of tyranny and injustice

00:58:35.733 --> 00:58:37.933
are welcome to it.

00:58:45.366 --> 00:58:46.900
- My lord Creon,

00:58:46.933 --> 00:58:49.533
your son is gone so desperate
and in such a hurry,

00:58:49.566 --> 00:58:50.833
I am afraid for him.

00:58:50.866 --> 00:58:53.266
- When young men are angry,
anything is possible.

00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:54.300
- Let him go.

00:58:54.333 --> 00:58:55.433
Let him do as he pleases.

00:58:55.466 --> 00:58:57.366
Let him rave himself senseless.

00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:00.833
It's all noise and nonsense.

00:59:00.866 --> 00:59:02.633
The two women are sentenced!

00:59:02.666 --> 00:59:05.633
It'll take more than that
to reprieve them, I promise you.

00:59:05.666 --> 00:59:08.633
- Both of them, sir?

00:59:08.666 --> 00:59:12.666
You mean to put
both of the sisters to death?

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.000
- No, you're right.

00:59:14.330 --> 00:59:15.733
I can take advice.

00:59:15.766 --> 00:59:18.500
The one who covered the body,
not the other.

00:59:18.533 --> 00:59:21.366
- And for the condemned one?

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:23.000
- What manner of death?

00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:24.833
- Take her
to some lonely place,

00:59:24.866 --> 00:59:26.700
a desert unfrequented by anyone,

00:59:26.733 --> 00:59:28.366
find a cave,
and wall her up in it.

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.166
Bury her alive!

00:59:33.333 --> 00:59:34.600
But with just enough food

00:59:34.633 --> 00:59:37.366
so that no guilt for her death
will fall upon us,

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.566
neither state nor city.

00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:40.733
She'll have plenty of time

00:59:40.766 --> 00:59:42.866
to honor
the gods of the dead there,

00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:45.766
since they receive
so many of her prayers.

00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:47.866
They will release her
one way or the other,

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:50.200
and she will learn
that worshipping the dead

00:59:50.233 --> 00:59:51.900
is not the business
of the living.

00:59:57.766 --> 01:00:00.933
- When the god
of unbridled passion makes war,

01:00:00.966 --> 01:00:02.966
he always wins.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.500
- No force on earth
can withstand

01:00:05.533 --> 01:00:09.533
his powerful, merciless hand.

01:00:09.566 --> 01:00:13.660
- When the first flowers appear
in a young girl's cheeks,

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.660
remorseless magic begins.

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:18.533
- And then from the deepest
valley to the highest peak,

01:00:18.566 --> 01:00:20.330
his traps are set.

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:23.800
- And no man's sins or virtues
can keep him from the net.

01:00:23.833 --> 01:00:26.133
- The mania is universal.

01:00:26.166 --> 01:00:28.433
- The gods themselves run mad.

01:00:28.466 --> 01:00:30.233
- Men lose their wits,

01:00:30.266 --> 01:00:31.633
and no one is spared.

01:00:31.666 --> 01:00:35.400
- When the madness strikes,
no one is safe.

01:00:35.433 --> 01:00:37.933
The maturest of men
will commit follies

01:00:37.966 --> 01:00:41.833
and crimes
undreamed of in saner times.

01:00:41.866 --> 01:00:45.400
- What else could provoke this
strife between father and son,

01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:49.433
this family divided
and murderous anger between kin?

01:00:49.466 --> 01:00:52.300
- There is fire
in a woman's eye

01:00:52.333 --> 01:00:54.866
incited by such consuming heat,

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:58.333
a man's mind can burn.

01:00:58.366 --> 01:01:01.566
- Aphrodite shares powers
with Zeus!

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.533
- Her seat
is at his right hand!

01:01:04.566 --> 01:01:07.833
- Her lightning
strikes the heart,

01:01:07.866 --> 01:01:11.466
and its power is frightening!

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.966
[loud gong chimes]

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.966
[deep grinding noise]

01:01:28.866 --> 01:01:31.366
- Yet how can we talk
of justice

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.300
and the needs of the state...

01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:37.900
- While we stand and watch
this unendurable sight?

01:01:37.933 --> 01:01:40.700
- My eyes will have their way
and weep

01:01:40.733 --> 01:01:42.366
seeing Antigone,

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.200
calm as a bride

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:45.900
going to her bedchamber...

01:01:45.933 --> 01:01:47.833
- To marry the dead

01:01:47.866 --> 01:01:50.766
and share
their everlasting sleep.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.660
- In all my wanderings,
gentlemen,

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:10.500
this place has been my home.

01:02:10.533 --> 01:02:13.933
I was born in this city,

01:02:13.966 --> 01:02:18.133
and now I begin my last journey.

01:02:18.166 --> 01:02:21.933
I look up at the Sun
in its familiar sky

01:02:21.966 --> 01:02:25.533
and feel its warmth on my face,

01:02:25.566 --> 01:02:28.700
only to say good-bye.

01:02:28.733 --> 01:02:30.400
In the daytime of my life,

01:02:30.433 --> 01:02:34.500
in mid breath, this security
policeman death arrests me

01:02:34.533 --> 01:02:35.866
as he arrests everyone,

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:37.966
young and old,
at home or in the street.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.833
To the cold waters of darkness
we come,

01:02:41.866 --> 01:02:46.233
never to return
across that silent river.

01:02:46.266 --> 01:02:48.866
No wedding for me,

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:50.566
no music,

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.500
no guests in the room.

01:02:52.533 --> 01:02:55.700
My wedding gift
is eternity in a stone tomb,

01:02:55.733 --> 01:02:59.733
my dowry forever not to be,

01:02:59.766 --> 01:03:04.800
death my bridegroom.

01:03:04.833 --> 01:03:06.966
- But your action is famous.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.766
In every street,
mouths whisper "Antigone."

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.266
- You go down to the dead

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.433
with the promise of glory
ringing in your head

01:03:17.466 --> 01:03:20.633
and nothing
to devalue your beauty.

01:03:20.666 --> 01:03:22.600
No sword has scarred you,

01:03:22.633 --> 01:03:25.766
plague visited.

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:28.866
- Unmarked, untouched,

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.466
you pass
from the dangerous light

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:34.633
into the safety
of eternal night,

01:03:34.666 --> 01:03:37.500
alive, alone,

01:03:37.533 --> 01:03:39.433
and free.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.633
- Do you remember the sad story
of Tantalus' daughter?

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.266
She was a stranger from Phrygia
unmarried, like me,

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:56.666
in danger like mine.

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.400
She was sentenced to die
on the rock of Sipylus,

01:03:59.433 --> 01:04:01.666
and there was no glory for her,

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:03.666
only the endless shock
of the elements

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:06.330
and the terrible place
where she was imprisoned,

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:10.800
the mountains' embrace like
fingers of ivy tying her down,

01:04:10.833 --> 01:04:12.566
enclosing, entombing her,

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.100
and she all alone
while the snows blinded her

01:04:15.133 --> 01:04:16.900
and the freezing rain
whipped her to rags

01:04:16.933 --> 01:04:20.633
and exposed her pain
to the naked sky.

01:04:20.666 --> 01:04:24.200
What bitter tears she shed
as she slowly turned to stone

01:04:24.233 --> 01:04:28.200
and the gray rock petrified her

01:04:28.233 --> 01:04:31.233
by inches,

01:04:31.266 --> 01:04:34.500
and she died.

01:04:34.533 --> 01:04:37.666
Her story is mine.

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:40.833
Today I shall share
her rocky bed.

01:04:40.866 --> 01:04:42.900
- But she was a goddess,

01:04:42.933 --> 01:04:45.866
not born for death
like the children of men...

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:49.466
- Whose desperate mortality
is their only certainty.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.166
Would it soothe your pain
to share her destiny...

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:56.133
- Or soften your distress as,
alive in the earth,

01:04:56.166 --> 01:05:01.100
you draw your last breath
like her to be living again?

01:05:01.133 --> 01:05:05.500
- Are you laughing at me?

01:05:05.533 --> 01:05:10.660
By everything this city of our fathers
has ever held sacred,

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:14.300
you landowners, you elder statesmen,
you rulers of Thebes,

01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:16.833
my dying is no joke!

01:05:16.866 --> 01:05:19.766
Am I a figure of fun
to be mocked like this

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:23.966
and publicly humiliated
as I leave you forever?

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Then forests and meadows
and our Theban river,

01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:31.366
glittering pathways
ceaselessly flowing

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.660
from Dirce's death till now,

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.633
flat lands thundering
beneath our chariots,

01:05:35.666 --> 01:05:37.833
you must be my witnesses,

01:05:37.866 --> 01:05:40.566
my only friends and mourners

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.100
as, victimized by an unjust law,

01:05:43.133 --> 01:05:47.500
I go to my last home
in the living tomb to wait

01:05:47.533 --> 01:05:51.900
while the slow darkness descends

01:05:51.933 --> 01:05:57.466
cold and starving
on my stony bed

01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:01.966
halfway between the living
and the dead.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.666
- No one has ever dared
to go so far before

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:09.633
as you have dared to go.

01:06:09.666 --> 01:06:13.400
- Now you have stumbled
and stubbed your toe

01:06:13.433 --> 01:06:15.366
and will shortly shed your blood

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:19.433
on the marble staircase
of the law.

01:06:19.466 --> 01:06:21.633
- You carry
your father's crimes

01:06:21.666 --> 01:06:23.833
like a millstone on your back.

01:06:23.866 --> 01:06:26.000
Small wonder in such times

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:30.330
if the bones bend or break.

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:33.233
- Nothing more painful
than that:

01:06:33.266 --> 01:06:37.333
the remembrance
of my father's long agony

01:06:37.366 --> 01:06:40.400
and the curse on my suffering family
from the beginning.

01:06:40.433 --> 01:06:43.233
So much grief
from the unlucky chance

01:06:43.266 --> 01:06:45.000
of the son
finding the mother's bed

01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:46.300
and worse than anything,

01:06:46.333 --> 01:06:48.733
the benighted offspring
of that unspeakable marriage.

01:06:48.766 --> 01:06:52.660
And I, with the others,

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:56.133
share that terrible destiny.

01:06:56.166 --> 01:06:57.700
Conceived in incest,

01:06:57.733 --> 01:06:59.966
no repentance
can soften the punishment.

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:02.933
The years pass,
the agony increases,

01:07:02.966 --> 01:07:04.866
and there is no pity
for our tears.

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:06.900
No marriage for me, for certain.

01:07:06.933 --> 01:07:08.466
I shall close that book forever

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.400
as I meet my mother and father
in the shade.

01:07:11.433 --> 01:07:14.660
The weddings will cease!

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:15.566
Marriage to the woman of Argos

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.400
finished my brother
and finished me too.

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:19.330
There will never be another.

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.900
- To pay respect to the dead
is praiseworthy,

01:07:21.933 --> 01:07:23.666
an act of love.

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:26.300
And religion
must have its due...

01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:29.900
- But no civilized state
can eschew authority.

01:07:29.933 --> 01:07:32.000
Laws must be obeyed,

01:07:32.330 --> 01:07:34.766
whether you approve
or disapprove.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.900
- You refuse to sanction
the power of the state.

01:07:37.933 --> 01:07:40.100
You invite disaster

01:07:40.133 --> 01:07:42.533
and connive at your own fate.

01:07:44.733 --> 01:07:49.266
- Spare me your sympathy.

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:53.366
Weep no false tears.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.600
I know the path
that I must follow

01:07:56.633 --> 01:08:00.933
to the sunless country
of eternal sorrow,

01:08:00.966 --> 01:08:06.333
the bleak waters of eternity,

01:08:06.366 --> 01:08:11.833
the unimaginable years.

01:08:11.866 --> 01:08:16.366
No grief where none is felt.

01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:20.100
I shall go alone and in silence

01:08:20.133 --> 01:08:21.800
to my house of stone.

01:08:29.466 --> 01:08:33.100
- If death could be prevented
by singing arias about it

01:08:33.133 --> 01:08:35.500
or other self-indulgent
displays of grief,

01:08:35.533 --> 01:08:39.366
this performance would go on forever,
I've no doubt,

01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.333
but I've had enough of it.

01:08:41.366 --> 01:08:42.500
Take her away.

01:08:42.533 --> 01:08:44.300
Lock her up in her stone vault

01:08:44.333 --> 01:08:45.900
with half a mountain for a roof,

01:08:45.933 --> 01:08:47.933
and then brick up the door.

01:08:47.966 --> 01:08:51.433
Let her die there
if she chooses,

01:08:51.466 --> 01:08:54.466
or if she prefers to stay alive
in her grave, she can,

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:57.933
because the grave's
the only fit place for her,

01:08:57.966 --> 01:09:01.433
solitary confinement
among the dead.

01:09:01.466 --> 01:09:03.500
Whatever she does,

01:09:03.533 --> 01:09:09.300
there will be no guilt
on me or on the city.

01:09:09.333 --> 01:09:11.500
Her death's her own,

01:09:11.533 --> 01:09:13.700
but there's no place for her
among the living.

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:16.500
- To my grave, then,

01:09:16.533 --> 01:09:19.766
my honeymoon bed,

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:22.300
my prison,

01:09:22.333 --> 01:09:26.166
my crypt
under the mountain,

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:30.433
my home for the rest of time.

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:34.200
I shall meet
so many of my relations there.

01:09:34.233 --> 01:09:35.533
We shall all be guests

01:09:35.566 --> 01:09:39.660
of that sad-faced queen
of the shadows, Persephone,

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:43.766
in that bleak hotel
that is never short of a room.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.366
I am the last,

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:49.300
the unhappiest, I think,

01:09:49.333 --> 01:09:50.766
and the youngest,

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:54.166
booking in too soon,

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.100
but my father will be there

01:09:56.133 --> 01:09:58.433
to meet me at the door.

01:09:58.466 --> 01:10:01.200
My mother will smile
and hold me as she often did,

01:10:01.233 --> 01:10:02.733
and my brother,

01:10:02.766 --> 01:10:05.666
he will be glad to see me
more than all the rest.

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:08.933
At each fresh grave,
my hands sprinkled the earth,

01:10:08.966 --> 01:10:12.366
at each,
I poured the purifying water

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.666
and made offerings.

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:19.300
And for my beloved Polynices,

01:10:19.333 --> 01:10:22.000
whose broken body I set to rest,

01:10:22.330 --> 01:10:26.766
I am rewarded
with a shameful death.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.400
There are some, I know,

01:10:29.433 --> 01:10:32.933
more thoughtful people
who respect my action.

01:10:32.966 --> 01:10:35.330
They must justify me.

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:36.933
Not for a husband,
do you understand,

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:38.700
not even for a son
would I have done this.

01:10:38.733 --> 01:10:39.900
If the law had forbidden it,

01:10:39.933 --> 01:10:41.800
I would have bowed my head
and let them rot.

01:10:41.833 --> 01:10:43.233
Does that make sense?

01:10:43.266 --> 01:10:45.400
I could have married again,
another husband,

01:10:45.433 --> 01:10:47.400
had more children by him
if the first had died.

01:10:47.433 --> 01:10:49.330
Do you see?

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:52.133
Well, do you understand me?

01:10:52.166 --> 01:10:53.833
My mother and father are dead.

01:10:53.866 --> 01:10:55.966
There can be no more brothers,
never again.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.433
My love had to speak
at Polynices' grave or nowhere.

01:10:59.466 --> 01:11:03.133
And for that,
Creon sentences me to death,

01:11:03.166 --> 01:11:05.366
drags me here,
and will shut me away

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.660
in a cavern under the mountain,

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:12.833
a living death in silence
and darkness and solitude.

01:11:12.866 --> 01:11:14.233
I shall die unmarried.

01:11:14.266 --> 01:11:16.300
All those pleasures denied me

01:11:16.333 --> 01:11:17.900
and motherhood denied too,

01:11:17.933 --> 01:11:19.766
no children to love me;

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.966
to love.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.466
And now, no friends.

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.433
What moral law have I broken?

01:11:28.466 --> 01:11:31.433
What eternal truths
have I denied?

01:11:31.466 --> 01:11:34.200
Yet now not even a god
can help me,

01:11:34.233 --> 01:11:36.400
and there's no man who will;
I'm sure of that.

01:11:36.433 --> 01:11:39.333
No help and no hope.

01:11:39.366 --> 01:11:40.500
How can there be,

01:11:40.533 --> 01:11:46.733
when common decency
has become a crime?

01:11:46.766 --> 01:11:49.166
If the gods in heaven
have changed their minds

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.933
and this is the way
they order things now,

01:11:50.966 --> 01:11:53.766
I shall soon know it,

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:58.400
and I shall have learned
my lesson the hard way.

01:11:58.433 --> 01:12:02.266
But if some others are mistaken,

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:06.266
let them be punished
as I have been punished,

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.333
no worse than that

01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:10.100
and no less either.

01:12:10.133 --> 01:12:13.233
- She hasn't changed,
even now.

01:12:13.266 --> 01:12:16.600
- The anger inside her
still blows like a hurricane.

01:12:16.633 --> 01:12:19.166
- The sooner
she's got rid of,

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.300
shut up out of harm's way
and forgotten,

01:12:21.333 --> 01:12:23.733
the better.

01:12:23.766 --> 01:12:26.333
Tell those guards to get a move on,
or they'll regret it.

01:12:26.366 --> 01:12:29.433
- That word is my death.

01:12:29.466 --> 01:12:31.933
- Now it is spoken.

01:12:31.966 --> 01:12:34.600
Don't comfort yourself
with hope.

01:12:34.633 --> 01:12:39.400
There's none.

01:12:39.433 --> 01:12:43.660
- This is the land
of my fathers,

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.100
Thebes,

01:12:45.133 --> 01:12:49.666
built by a god.

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:53.233
You see, senators,

01:12:53.266 --> 01:12:56.300
my time has run out.

01:12:56.333 --> 01:12:58.200
There's no more left.

01:12:58.233 --> 01:13:02.966
I am the last
of the royal blood,

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.300
a daughter of kings,

01:13:06.333 --> 01:13:11.660
and I die his victim,
unjustly,

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:13.200
for upholding justice

01:13:13.233 --> 01:13:16.660
and the humanity of humankind.

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:02.330
- Others have suffered,
my child, like you.

01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:03.600
- Upon Danae too,

01:14:03.633 --> 01:14:06.166
the same dreadful sentence
was passed.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:09.300
- Far from the light of day,
in a tower of brass,

01:14:09.333 --> 01:14:10.566
she was shut away.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:14.533
- And that one single room,
both prison and tomb...

01:14:14.566 --> 01:14:17.330
- Became her wedding chamber
at last.

01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:19.600
- Like you,
she was a child of kings,

01:14:19.633 --> 01:14:22.100
yet in her womb,
the semen of Zeus,

01:14:22.133 --> 01:14:23.866
descending in a golden shower...

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:26.666
- Made a mockery
of the brazen tower.

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:29.660
- Fate has its own momentum.

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:32.330
When things must be,
they will be.

01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:35.266
- What use is power
in the state or wealth...

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.666
- Massive armies,
an unsinkable fleet?

01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:42.100
- Guards make their entrances
by strength or stealth.

01:14:42.133 --> 01:14:46.100
- And no tombs or towers
can keep them out.

01:15:03.366 --> 01:15:07.330
- The arrogant king Lycurgus
discovered wisdom

01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:10.500
when he angered the god Dionysus
with his railing.

01:15:10.533 --> 01:15:12.633
That proud Edonian king

01:15:12.666 --> 01:15:14.600
was punished with madness...

01:15:14.633 --> 01:15:17.733
- And long imprisoned
in a rocky cell

01:15:17.766 --> 01:15:21.966
to endure the private
and particular hell of lunacy

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.133
till the healing silence soothed
and reordered his brain.

01:15:27.166 --> 01:15:30.500
He learned there
the terrible power

01:15:30.533 --> 01:15:32.633
of the god he had challenged.

01:15:32.666 --> 01:15:36.900
- Ecstasy is beyond
man's understanding,

01:15:36.933 --> 01:15:39.666
a mystery deeper than reason

01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:41.600
which overcomes pain

01:15:41.633 --> 01:15:44.933
and seeks truth in intoxication

01:15:44.966 --> 01:15:45.966
and terror.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.660
- Only a fool would attempt

01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.566
to stop the maenads
in full flight

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:53.133
or silence
their ecstatic singing.

01:15:53.166 --> 01:15:56.600
- The sleep of reason
is not darkness...

01:15:56.633 --> 01:16:00.166
- But another kind of light.

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:07.366
- And where the gloomy rocks
divide the seas in Thrace,

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.800
by the Bosphorus...

01:16:08.833 --> 01:16:10.633
- The savage god Ares laughed

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:13.800
to see the sons of Phineus
blinded with a spindle.

01:16:13.833 --> 01:16:17.233
- Nothing could placate their
vengeful stepmother's hate.

01:16:17.266 --> 01:16:19.633
- Her bloody needle
darkened their eyes forever...

01:16:19.666 --> 01:16:21.366
- Blinding the children...

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.866
- As the gods
had blinded the father.

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:25.466
- On their mother's
wedding day,

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:26.933
their destiny was settled.

01:16:26.966 --> 01:16:29.733
- Their wasted lives
they wept away

01:16:29.766 --> 01:16:31.500
in sightless misery.

01:16:31.533 --> 01:16:34.000
- Yet she was descended
from the gods.

01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:36.100
- In the echoing caves
of the north wind,

01:16:36.133 --> 01:16:37.600
she hollooed as a child...

01:16:37.633 --> 01:16:39.333
- And on
the open mountainside...

01:16:39.366 --> 01:16:45.233
- Ran wild with the horses.

01:16:45.266 --> 01:16:48.533
all: Man's fate is determined,

01:16:48.566 --> 01:16:50.800
will not be denied.

01:16:50.833 --> 01:16:53.330
The child Antigone

01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:56.500
pays for the parents' pride.

01:17:03.933 --> 01:17:05.566
- Senators of Thebes

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.700
and your new King Creon,

01:17:07.733 --> 01:17:10.200
we've traveled together,
my boy and I,

01:17:10.233 --> 01:17:13.330
sharing one pair of eyes
between the two of us,

01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:15.700
which is the way blind men
must make their journeys.

01:17:15.733 --> 01:17:17.800
- Tiresias.

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:20.166
What news brings an old man
such a distance?

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.833
- Important news
that can't wait

01:17:21.866 --> 01:17:24.400
and advice which,
if you're wise, you'll listen to.

01:17:24.433 --> 01:17:27.566
- I've always listened,
acted upon it too, more than once.

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.666
- Like a sensible captain
who values his pilot,

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:30.800
you've avoided the rocks.

01:17:30.833 --> 01:17:31.900
- I admit it; we all do.

01:17:31.933 --> 01:17:33.133
We're in your debt.

01:17:33.166 --> 01:17:36.100
- Then for God's sake,
listen to me now.

01:17:36.133 --> 01:17:38.166
You're like a man
balanced on a razor,

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:42.166
likely to fall
or cut himself to pieces.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.233
- Are you serious?

01:17:44.266 --> 01:17:46.300
Any man would shudder,
hearing such things

01:17:46.333 --> 01:17:50.833
from your lips that
have foretold so many horrors.

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:52.330
Tell me what you mean.

01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:54.833
- Oh, yes, I intend to.

01:17:54.866 --> 01:17:58.133
Everything my experience
of forecasting the future

01:17:58.166 --> 01:18:00.800
and understanding symbols
reveal to me,

01:18:00.833 --> 01:18:03.133
I will make plain to you.

01:18:03.166 --> 01:18:05.666
I was sitting in my usual seat,

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.366
a place where
I can hear the singing

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.300
in the secret language
of the birds

01:18:09.333 --> 01:18:11.533
and understand their meaning,

01:18:11.566 --> 01:18:13.900
when I heard,
quite unexpectedly,

01:18:13.933 --> 01:18:15.833
a terrible new sound,

01:18:15.866 --> 01:18:18.700
like shrieking
or cries of anguish,

01:18:18.733 --> 01:18:21.533
hysterical twittering
and whistling

01:18:21.566 --> 01:18:25.660
like the babble
of a barbaric language

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:29.800
capable of expressing
only hatred or pain.

01:18:29.833 --> 01:18:31.933
By that
and the wild beating of wings,

01:18:31.966 --> 01:18:34.660
I knew the birds were at war.

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:37.333
Such sounds
could mean nothing else.

01:18:37.366 --> 01:18:38.566
I could well imagine

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:42.333
their blood-stained beaks
and dripping claws,

01:18:42.366 --> 01:18:45.700
and that thought
disturbed me deeply.

01:18:45.733 --> 01:18:48.433
At once, I went to my altar
to see what I could learn

01:18:48.466 --> 01:18:50.300
from the sacrifice by fire,

01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:52.100
but nothing would burn.

01:18:52.133 --> 01:18:55.100
A stinking liquid
fell from the flesh

01:18:55.133 --> 01:18:56.466
and dropped on the embers

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:59.166
and sizzled and bubbled
among the ashes.

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.366
Then the gallbladder burst,

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:04.500
spurting stinking acid
across the meat,

01:19:04.533 --> 01:19:07.266
and all the fat melted

01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:11.700
and was rendered down
till the bone was left bare.

01:19:11.733 --> 01:19:13.766
I saw all this,

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.766
or my boy saw it.

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:19.233
He sees for me
what my eyes cannot,

01:19:19.266 --> 01:19:23.266
just as I see things to which
other people are blind,

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.000
but from that filth,
I read nothing.

01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:28.566
The oracle was clogged
with fat and decay.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:31.100
And then it was revealed.

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:34.633
I understood that you,
King Creon,

01:19:34.666 --> 01:19:38.766
hath decreed this filth
that chokes our altars.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:43.866
The blood and flesh
which decays and stinks there

01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:45.800
is the blood and flesh vomited

01:19:45.833 --> 01:19:49.766
from the gullets of dogs
and carrion crows.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.966
The blood of Polynices,

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.166
the flesh of that unluckiest
of the sons of Oedipus,

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.933
still unburied

01:19:58.966 --> 01:20:02.700
and affronting
more than our sense of smell.

01:20:02.733 --> 01:20:05.200
The gods themselves
are disgusted.

01:20:05.233 --> 01:20:07.500
They reject our prayers
and sacrifices.

01:20:07.533 --> 01:20:09.100
How could they do otherwise?

01:20:09.133 --> 01:20:12.000
How can the birds
sing of anything but horrors

01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:14.533
blown out
of this banquet of human blood,

01:20:14.566 --> 01:20:18.900
clogged and stinking
till their very beaks drip with it?

01:20:18.933 --> 01:20:21.233
My son, listen to me.

01:20:21.266 --> 01:20:25.000
Any man can make a mistake
or commit a crime.

01:20:25.330 --> 01:20:27.866
The man who can
recognize what he has done,

01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:32.330
see that he is mistaken
and are morally wrong,

01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:33.833
admits it and puts it right,

01:20:33.866 --> 01:20:37.700
that man proves that there is
never too late to become wise,

01:20:37.733 --> 01:20:39.566
and no one will condemn him.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:43.466
But if he compounds
his stupidity with stubbornness

01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:46.466
and an obstinate refusal
to face the facts,

01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:48.866
he is nothing but a fool.

01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:52.433
Is there anyone more stupid
than a stupid man

01:20:52.466 --> 01:20:55.700
who cannot see
his own stupidity?

01:20:55.733 --> 01:20:58.433
Polynices is dead.

01:20:58.466 --> 01:21:01.666
Don't revenge yourself
on his remains.

01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:05.500
You can kill a man once
and once only.

01:21:05.533 --> 01:21:08.333
Is there any glory to be gained

01:21:08.366 --> 01:21:11.666
by defeating a poor corpse?

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:15.200
This is good advice, my son,

01:21:15.233 --> 01:21:19.500
sincerely offered
by one who wishes you well.

01:21:19.533 --> 01:21:24.333
Take it.

01:21:24.366 --> 01:21:28.166
- So that's your news,
is it, old man?

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.000
I am to be the target, am I,

01:21:30.330 --> 01:21:34.333
for everyone to shoot at?

01:21:34.366 --> 01:21:37.666
Well, I am wise too,

01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:39.633
wise to the ways
of fortune-tellers

01:21:39.666 --> 01:21:43.433
and the buying and selling
you all go in for,

01:21:43.466 --> 01:21:46.300
and I am to be
the latest bargain, I see.

01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:47.933
I am to be bought and sold

01:21:47.966 --> 01:21:49.800
like silver
from the mines of Sardis

01:21:49.833 --> 01:21:51.333
or gold from India.

01:21:51.366 --> 01:21:53.333
I am to be part of the trade.

01:21:53.366 --> 01:21:56.000
Well, let me tell you this,
Tiresias.

01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:57.666
There is not enough gold
in the world

01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:59.733
to buy a grave for that man!

01:21:59.766 --> 01:22:02.330
If golden eagles
should carry him up

01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:03.900
by joints and shreds to Zeus

01:22:03.933 --> 01:22:07.333
and spew him in gobbets
on the marble floor of Olympus,

01:22:07.366 --> 01:22:09.330
not even that blasphemy
would be enough

01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:10.400
to defect me from my purpose,

01:22:10.433 --> 01:22:13.800
because I know
that no single human act,

01:22:13.833 --> 01:22:15.833
however much
it may degrade the earth

01:22:15.866 --> 01:22:17.766
and the man who perpetrates
or suffer it,

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:22.866
can stain the purity
of the ever-living gods.

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:25.566
But let me tell you this,
Tiresias.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.300
A man can fall.

01:22:27.333 --> 01:22:29.866
He can fall like a stone,

01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:32.660
especially when he pretends
to give good advice

01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:35.300
and wraps it up in
a profound cloak of religiosity

01:22:35.333 --> 01:22:38.166
when all the time,
naked self-interest

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.733
and the greed for profit

01:22:39.766 --> 01:22:41.833
are the only motives
that matter to him.

01:22:41.866 --> 01:22:44.133
- Are there any wise men
left anywhere?

01:22:44.166 --> 01:22:45.566
- Oh, how profound.

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:48.000
Do you have any other thunderous
platitudes to follow that one?

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:50.166
- Mature judgment
cannot be bought.

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:52.100
No treasure is as valuable,

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:54.800
and good advice is worth
more than a fortune to any man--

01:22:54.833 --> 01:22:56.833
- Bad advice
is worse than worthless,

01:22:56.866 --> 01:22:59.100
a disease which infects
the wisest of men.

01:22:59.133 --> 01:23:01.233
- You describe
your own symptoms exactly.

01:23:01.266 --> 01:23:03.500
- Well, then,
my so-called prophet, tell me,

01:23:03.533 --> 01:23:06.000
will any of these insults
be of any benefit to anyone?

01:23:06.330 --> 01:23:07.433
- None at all.

01:23:07.466 --> 01:23:09.433
And yet you insult me.

01:23:09.466 --> 01:23:13.100
You say that my predictions
are both false and dishonest.

01:23:13.133 --> 01:23:14.666
- That is because
all fortune-tellers

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:17.330
are money-grubbers
and charlatans.

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:19.330
- Kings too have been known
to be acquisitive.

01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:21.330
- Do you know the man
you're speaking to?

01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:22.100
I am the king.

01:23:22.133 --> 01:23:23.366
- You are the king, yes.

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:25.000
My good advice
helped to make you one.

01:23:25.330 --> 01:23:26.766
- Oh, you've had your
successes; I know that.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.330
You've been proved right
on more than one occasion,

01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:31.000
but honesty is another matter.

01:23:31.330 --> 01:23:32.233
I've never trusted you.

01:23:32.266 --> 01:23:34.433
- Don't provoke me
to tell you everything.

01:23:34.466 --> 01:23:35.600
- What do you mean?

01:23:35.633 --> 01:23:36.633
- Everything I know.

01:23:36.666 --> 01:23:37.766
- Say what you like.

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.700
Say anything at all,
but say it honestly,

01:23:39.733 --> 01:23:40.933
not for cash!

01:23:40.966 --> 01:23:43.600
- Are you really
foolish enough to believe

01:23:43.633 --> 01:23:45.266
that money
has ever been my motive?

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:48.466
- Because my integrity
is not for sale.

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:50.366
Tell your buyer that,
whoever he is!

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:51.833
- Listen, Creon,

01:23:51.866 --> 01:23:53.700
this is the truth.

01:23:53.733 --> 01:23:56.500
Before many more days,

01:23:56.533 --> 01:23:58.700
before the Sun has risen,

01:23:58.733 --> 01:24:02.330
well, shall we say
a few more times,

01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:04.733
you will have made your payment
corpse for corpse

01:24:04.766 --> 01:24:08.533
with a child of your own blood.

01:24:08.566 --> 01:24:11.700
You have buried
the one still living.

01:24:11.733 --> 01:24:14.333
The woman
who moves and breathes

01:24:14.366 --> 01:24:16.900
you have given to the grave

01:24:16.933 --> 01:24:20.800
and the man you have left
unwashed, unwept,

01:24:20.833 --> 01:24:24.566
and without the common courtesy
of a decent covering of earth

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:27.660
so that both have been wronged,

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:30.800
and the gods of the underworld
to whom the body justly belongs

01:24:30.833 --> 01:24:33.300
are denied it and are insulted.

01:24:33.333 --> 01:24:35.766
Such matters
are not for you to judge.

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.500
You usurp ancient rites

01:24:37.533 --> 01:24:40.700
which even the gods themselves
don't dare to question,

01:24:40.733 --> 01:24:45.366
powers that are not
within the prerogative of kings.

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:49.200
Even now, this minute,

01:24:49.233 --> 01:24:51.866
the avengers are on their way.

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:57.466
The furies, who rise up from hell
and swoop down from heaven

01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:00.660
fix their hooks
in those who commit crimes

01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:01.866
and will never let go.

01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:03.833
The suffering
that you inflicted on others

01:25:03.866 --> 01:25:05.500
will be inflicted upon you.

01:25:05.533 --> 01:25:08.700
You will suffer as they did.

01:25:08.733 --> 01:25:11.100
Have I been bribed,
do you think?

01:25:11.133 --> 01:25:14.266
Am I speaking for money now?

01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:17.766
Before very long--
yes, it will be soon--

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:21.200
there will be screaming
and bitter tears

01:25:21.233 --> 01:25:24.433
and hysterical crying
in this house,

01:25:24.466 --> 01:25:26.966
men as well as women.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.200
Other cities too, other states,
will turn upon you

01:25:30.233 --> 01:25:32.100
for the crime
you have committed.

01:25:32.133 --> 01:25:35.633
Dogs and vultures
will swarm in the streets,

01:25:35.666 --> 01:25:39.200
dropping fragments
of the unburied man

01:25:39.233 --> 01:25:42.500
in corners, on doorsteps,
in the public squares.

01:25:42.533 --> 01:25:44.966
They will smell the pollution

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.733
and turn to you, its author.

01:25:50.266 --> 01:25:53.600
That is all I have to say.

01:25:53.633 --> 01:25:55.533
You made me angry, Creon,

01:25:55.566 --> 01:25:58.233
with your crude accusations,

01:25:58.266 --> 01:26:01.433
and so I made you my target.

01:26:01.466 --> 01:26:04.766
And like a good marksman,
all my shots have hit the bull.

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:06.633
You can feel them, can't you?

01:26:06.666 --> 01:26:12.633
You can feel the pain
like an arrow here.

01:26:12.666 --> 01:26:18.600
Take me home now, boy.

01:26:18.633 --> 01:26:20.666
Leave him alone

01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:23.200
to entertain
some younger ears than mine

01:26:23.233 --> 01:26:26.566
with his ridiculous outbursts--

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:32.166
either that or let him learn
maturer judgments

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:37.000
and how a wise man
controls his tongue.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.500
- My lord,

01:26:49.533 --> 01:26:53.300
he's gone, promising nothing
but disaster to come.

01:26:53.333 --> 01:26:55.733
My hair grew gray in this city.

01:26:55.766 --> 01:26:58.166
I was dark-haired here;
soon I will be white,

01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.333
and in all that time,

01:26:59.366 --> 01:27:01.100
I've never known
any of his prophecies

01:27:01.133 --> 01:27:02.966
to be proved wrong.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.633
- Neither have I, man.

01:27:05.666 --> 01:27:11.233
I know that much as well as you.

01:27:11.266 --> 01:27:13.833
My mind's torn apart
like a tug of war,

01:27:13.866 --> 01:27:17.233
one way, then the other.

01:27:17.266 --> 01:27:20.333
How can I give way now?

01:27:20.366 --> 01:27:22.733
Yet how can I stand here
like a fool

01:27:22.766 --> 01:27:25.233
and wait stubbornly for whatever
it is that's coming?

01:27:25.266 --> 01:27:27.500
- Lord Creon,
it's time to take good advice.

01:27:27.533 --> 01:27:29.366
- Give it, then.
Don't be afraid; I'll listen.

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.600
- Release the woman
from her underground prison.

01:27:31.633 --> 01:27:34.166
- And give honorable burial
to the dead man.

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:35.400
- So that's your advice:

01:27:35.433 --> 01:27:38.633
total collapse,
complete withdrawal.

01:27:38.666 --> 01:27:39.666
Do you all think that?

01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:40.833
- We do, sir.

01:27:40.866 --> 01:27:42.300
And do it quickly,
for heaven's sake.

01:27:42.333 --> 01:27:45.166
- The gods never move faster
than when punishing men

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.900
with the consequences
of their own actions.

01:27:47.933 --> 01:27:50.000
- How can I do it?

01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:52.166
It's unendurable
to deny every principle

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:55.333
and every action
I've stood fast by.

01:27:55.366 --> 01:27:57.966
Yet I dare not stand against
the iron laws of necessity.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.366
- Go on, sir; do it now,

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.500
and do it personally.

01:28:00.533 --> 01:28:02.733
- Not by proxy,
with your own hands.

01:28:02.766 --> 01:28:04.266
- Yes, I'll go.

01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:05.966
I'll go this instant.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.300
Somebody, anybody,
bring spades

01:28:09.333 --> 01:28:11.466
and sledgehammers
out onto the mountain.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:12.900
I'm coming with you.

01:28:12.933 --> 01:28:14.166
If I've changed my mind,

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:17.466
I will act upon it
with exactly the same determination.

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:20.233
I sentenced her,
and I'll set her free,

01:28:20.266 --> 01:28:24.700
tear down bricks
with my own hands, if necessary.

01:28:24.733 --> 01:28:27.833
Perhaps it is wisest
to let the old laws stand.

01:28:27.866 --> 01:28:30.733
My fear tells me it is,

01:28:30.766 --> 01:28:32.660
and that's a voice

01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:35.100
every prudent man
must listen to.

01:28:43.733 --> 01:28:46.100
all: Great God with many names,

01:28:46.133 --> 01:28:48.100
child of the thunder,

01:28:48.133 --> 01:28:51.233
whom Zeus conceived
on Cadmus' daughter

01:28:51.266 --> 01:28:52.933
here in Thebes

01:28:52.966 --> 01:28:55.533
Bacchus, Dionysus...

01:28:55.566 --> 01:28:57.500
- In Italy revered...

01:28:57.533 --> 01:28:59.900
- In Demeter's
mysterious illuses...

01:28:59.933 --> 01:29:02.900
- Where all grace dreams
its most secret dream...

01:29:02.933 --> 01:29:05.166
- Both praised and feared.

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.833
all: This is your naked city...

01:29:07.866 --> 01:29:11.200
- Where the quiet river
of Ismenus waters the meadows...

01:29:11.233 --> 01:29:14.233
- Where the feeble of ecstasy
possesses your womenfolk...

01:29:14.266 --> 01:29:16.200
all: Your known Thebes...

01:29:16.233 --> 01:29:21.666
- Where the dragon's teeth
press on.

01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:24.330
- The whole world worships you,

01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:26.966
wine god, intoxicator...

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.566
- On the two-pronged mountain
where the torches glitter

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:33.000
and the nymphs
of Parnassus dance...

01:29:33.330 --> 01:29:37.700
- By the pool where Castalia's
suicide made the waters magical,

01:29:37.733 --> 01:29:41.200
and the cool draft
inspires poets to frenzy

01:29:41.233 --> 01:29:44.660
and the true waters
of darkness reside.

01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:46.600
- From the impenetrable
slopes of Nysa,

01:29:46.633 --> 01:29:48.700
where the ivy runs wild

01:29:48.733 --> 01:29:51.433
and the vines
hang thick in your face,

01:29:51.466 --> 01:29:54.660
come home, Theban child.

01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:56.833
Let the world
sing its hymns in vain

01:29:56.866 --> 01:29:58.633
in the Theban streets...

01:29:58.666 --> 01:30:00.666
all: Hail!
- We shout.

01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:03.966
all: Bacchus, hail!

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.330
And the city waits.

01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:09.833
- Your mother, Semele,
died here...

01:30:09.866 --> 01:30:13.660
- Incinerated by the fire
of the universe...

01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:14.933
- Zeus, in his splendor.

01:30:14.966 --> 01:30:18.700
- Now in your city,
another disaster threatens.

01:30:18.733 --> 01:30:21.500
- Fear locks up our tongues...

01:30:21.533 --> 01:30:24.200
- And, like a plague sore
on the face,

01:30:24.233 --> 01:30:26.833
the state's disease
is made public.

01:30:26.866 --> 01:30:28.333
- We have done wrong.

01:30:28.366 --> 01:30:31.166
- Know the first necessity
is for healing...

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:33.400
- In Parnassus' rocky stream...

01:30:33.433 --> 01:30:36.566
- Or over the sighing waters
of the endless seas.

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:39.400
- Come to us, healer, and heal!

01:30:39.433 --> 01:30:42.333
- We have suffered too long.

01:30:42.366 --> 01:30:47.300
all: All the stars of the galaxy
whose hearts are fire

01:30:47.333 --> 01:30:49.466
throb to your music

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:52.633
and in those voices
of measureless night

01:30:52.666 --> 01:30:55.533
speak from the depths
of their mystery.

01:30:55.566 --> 01:30:58.900
- Come, with
your crazed followers,

01:30:58.933 --> 01:31:00.800
your lunatic wind,

01:31:00.833 --> 01:31:04.833
the wild maenads,
authentic son of Zeus...

01:31:04.866 --> 01:31:08.633
- Bring delight
and dancing till we drop...

01:31:08.666 --> 01:31:11.100
- Bring rest; bring peace...

01:31:11.133 --> 01:31:13.833
- Bring healing and rebirth...

01:31:13.866 --> 01:31:16.566
- Let our anguish cease...

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:18.800
all: Ecstatic God

01:31:18.833 --> 01:31:22.933
whose many names are one.

01:31:22.966 --> 01:31:26.933
- Senators, listen!

01:31:26.966 --> 01:31:28.966
Descendants of Cadmus
who founded our city

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.566
and Amphion who built it,

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:33.166
good people of Thebes,

01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:36.833
no man's life ever moves
smoothly according to plan.

01:31:36.866 --> 01:31:38.633
Who can make judgments,

01:31:38.666 --> 01:31:41.000
say this is praiseworthy
in human existence

01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:44.366
and this is to be despised,
when chance rules everything?

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.366
One moment a man rides high
on his fortune,

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:49.100
and the same moment,
he crashes to the depths.

01:31:49.133 --> 01:31:52.266
Luck, like the tide, is certain
to ebb after the flow,

01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:55.433
and no man can tell
what will happen tomorrow.

01:31:55.466 --> 01:31:58.200
Everyone surely envied Creon.

01:31:58.233 --> 01:31:59.866
He had brought his country
out of anarchy,

01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:01.766
taken power as king,

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:03.900
and his position in the state
was unchallenged.

01:32:03.933 --> 01:32:05.400
What's more, he ruled well,

01:32:05.433 --> 01:32:08.100
if firmly,
and his son was at his side

01:32:08.133 --> 01:32:11.330
to help and succeed him.

01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:14.600
All that is over now.

01:32:14.633 --> 01:32:16.366
What life can there be

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:19.233
when the things that make life pleasant
are all destroyed,

01:32:19.266 --> 01:32:25.666
a kind of death,
moving and breathing but not living?

01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:28.266
That's how it is for him.

01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:30.566
Of course,
he's rich beyond accounting.

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:31.866
He's a king still,

01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:35.660
with all the pomp and
circumstance that rank implies,

01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:36.100
but what's it worth

01:32:36.133 --> 01:32:37.933
when all the joy of life
is gone,

01:32:37.966 --> 01:32:41.500
a shadow, a mockery,
a vulgar pageant?

01:32:41.533 --> 01:32:44.330
Who can take pleasure
in wealth or power

01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:46.200
when all happiness
is dead in his heart?

01:32:46.233 --> 01:32:48.100
- More tragedy for this family.

01:32:48.133 --> 01:32:49.966
- Tell us your news.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.266
- They're both dead,

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.233
and the living
must take the blame.

01:32:54.266 --> 01:32:55.666
- Who's dead?
- Who killed them?

01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:57.000
- What happened?
Tell us.

01:32:57.330 --> 01:32:59.233
- The king's son Haemon,

01:32:59.266 --> 01:33:01.933
the royal blood shed
by a royal hand.

01:33:01.966 --> 01:33:03.266
- His father, you mean?

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:04.300
- Or his own.

01:33:04.333 --> 01:33:06.500
- His own held the sword,

01:33:06.533 --> 01:33:08.666
but his father's actions
drove it home.

01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:10.966
- The prophet warned us.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.866
- And it all came true.

01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:15.166
- That's how things are.

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:17.660
It's in your hands now.

01:33:20.766 --> 01:33:22.300
- The door is opening.
Look!

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.330
- Here's Eurydice...

01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:31.433
- Poor woman...

01:33:31.466 --> 01:33:33.366
- The king's wife.
- Does she know, do you think?

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:34.900
- Has she come here
by chance...

01:33:34.933 --> 01:33:37.566
- Or because she has heard
her son is dead?

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.933
- Gentlemen,

01:33:43.966 --> 01:33:45.900
good friends,

01:33:45.933 --> 01:33:49.233
my ears caught something
of what you were saying,

01:33:49.266 --> 01:33:52.400
a few words
as I opened the door.

01:33:52.433 --> 01:33:55.666
I was on my way to offer prayers
to Pallas Athenae.

01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:58.366
We had just drawn back the bolt

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:02.500
when I heard a few scraps
of your conversation.

01:34:02.533 --> 01:34:04.233
It was enough

01:34:04.266 --> 01:34:06.233
to make me fear
what all mothers fear:

01:34:06.266 --> 01:34:10.800
an accident or some disaster
to those we love.

01:34:10.833 --> 01:34:13.166
I nearly fainted.

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:17.733
My ladies-in-waiting
caught me in their arms.

01:34:17.766 --> 01:34:20.566
Please speak it out plainly.

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:23.330
Whatever it is, I can bear it.

01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:25.833
We are bred to stoicism
in this family.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.333
- Dear queen,

01:34:31.366 --> 01:34:33.300
whom we all respect,

01:34:33.333 --> 01:34:35.800
I was there; I saw it all,

01:34:35.833 --> 01:34:38.366
and I'll tell you
exactly what happened.

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:41.233
There's no point in trying
to soften the blow now,

01:34:41.266 --> 01:34:42.833
only to be proved a liar later.

01:34:42.866 --> 01:34:46.133
It's best to tell the truth.

01:34:46.166 --> 01:34:47.633
I went with the king,
your husband,

01:34:47.666 --> 01:34:48.833
to the edge of the battlefield,

01:34:48.866 --> 01:34:50.533
where we saw
the body of Polynices

01:34:50.566 --> 01:34:51.833
still lying where he fell

01:34:51.866 --> 01:34:53.330
and in a terrible state.

01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:54.966
The dogs had been at him.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.600
So we prayed,

01:34:56.633 --> 01:34:58.933
first to Hecate,
who haunts crossroads and tombs

01:34:58.966 --> 01:35:00.400
and the scenes
of crimes committed

01:35:00.433 --> 01:35:01.700
but not atoned for,

01:35:01.733 --> 01:35:03.566
and then to Pluto,
king of the dead.

01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:06.300
We asked them
to have pity on him and on us

01:35:06.333 --> 01:35:09.700
and not to be angry.

01:35:09.733 --> 01:35:11.800
Then we washed him,

01:35:11.833 --> 01:35:13.466
or what was left of him,
with holy water,

01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:15.700
cut fresh branches
to make a pyre,

01:35:15.733 --> 01:35:18.133
and burned the remains.

01:35:18.166 --> 01:35:19.333
Then we shoveled a mound

01:35:19.366 --> 01:35:23.500
of his own Theban earth
over the ashes.

01:35:23.533 --> 01:35:24.666
And as soon as we had done that,

01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:25.966
we hurried off
as fast as we could

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.666
to the prison cell
under the mountain

01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:29.333
that served as a bridal suite

01:35:29.366 --> 01:35:31.466
for the girl married to death.

01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:32.866
But before we arrived,

01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:35.233
one of the soldiers
with the unenviable job

01:35:35.266 --> 01:35:36.933
of guarding
that godforsaken place

01:35:36.966 --> 01:35:38.466
came running back
to tell the king

01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:40.700
that he'd heard a terrible noise

01:35:40.733 --> 01:35:44.330
like screaming
from inside the mountain.

01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:46.466
And as Creon got nearer,
he heard it too,

01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:49.366
faint but audible,

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:54.100
a kind of weird screaming
or moaning,

01:35:54.133 --> 01:35:55.366
low and unearthly,

01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:59.633
as though grief was speaking
its own naked language.

01:35:59.666 --> 01:36:02.366
When the king heard it,
he groaned aloud,

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.633
and we all heard him say,

01:36:04.666 --> 01:36:06.600
"Oh, God,

01:36:06.633 --> 01:36:08.833
"this is what I was afraid of.

01:36:08.866 --> 01:36:11.330
"Am I a prophet too?

01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:14.660
"This path up to the tomb,
these last few steps

01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:16.800
"is the most agonizing journey
I shall ever make.

01:36:16.833 --> 01:36:19.800
"I can hear my son's voice
in there.

01:36:19.833 --> 01:36:21.666
"You, quickly!
Guards, anybody, get in there!

01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:22.900
"Squeeze between the rocks

01:36:22.933 --> 01:36:24.900
"where somebody
has already forced an entrance.

01:36:24.933 --> 01:36:26.666
"Get into the main chamber
of the cave

01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:29.233
"and tell me if it is
my son's voice I recognized

01:36:29.266 --> 01:36:30.333
"or whether the guards

01:36:30.366 --> 01:36:34.166
are playing
some cruel trick with me."

01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:36.300
So we went in and looked

01:36:36.333 --> 01:36:38.500
as the half-crazed king
had told us to,

01:36:38.533 --> 01:36:41.266
and there
in the darkest corner,

01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:43.366
we saw her,

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.933
strung up by the neck,

01:36:45.966 --> 01:36:47.700
hanging from an improvised rope

01:36:47.733 --> 01:36:52.500
of twisted linen strips
torn from her own dress.

01:36:52.533 --> 01:36:54.300
Haemon was right beside her,

01:36:54.333 --> 01:36:57.533
cuddling her body
as it dangled there

01:36:57.566 --> 01:37:00.466
and sobbing, brokenheartedly,
at his wife's death

01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:01.600
and the marriage

01:37:01.633 --> 01:37:03.933
bad luck
and his father's cruelty

01:37:03.966 --> 01:37:07.233
had made certain
would never take place.

01:37:07.266 --> 01:37:09.100
When Creon saw them,

01:37:09.133 --> 01:37:11.466
he staggered into the cave,

01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:13.666
crying like a child,

01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:16.433
and sobbed aloud,
"My boy, my poor boy!

01:37:16.466 --> 01:37:18.433
What are you doing here?"

01:37:18.466 --> 01:37:20.330
And then,
"Have you gone mad coming here?

01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:21.600
"There's nothing here for you
but death

01:37:21.633 --> 01:37:23.833
"and annihilation
and despair.

01:37:23.866 --> 01:37:25.330
"Come away from there, my son!

01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:26.133
"I'm begging you, come away!

01:37:26.166 --> 01:37:30.633
For god's sake, come away!"

01:37:30.666 --> 01:37:33.300
The boy just looked at him,

01:37:33.333 --> 01:37:36.330
and his eyes were terrifying,

01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:40.366
with an anger
like I've never seen before.

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:44.600
Without a word,
he spat in his father's face

01:37:44.633 --> 01:37:46.833
and drew his sword

01:37:46.866 --> 01:37:49.833
and lunged
straight for the old man,

01:37:49.866 --> 01:37:51.733
but Creon was quick
and skipped out of distance.

01:37:51.766 --> 01:37:54.133
And the poor lad,

01:37:54.166 --> 01:37:56.500
hysterical with grief,

01:37:56.533 --> 01:37:58.466
braced his sword against a rock

01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:00.466
and thrust himself upon it
so fiercely,

01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.666
it pierced his belly
and came out through his back.

01:38:12.330 --> 01:38:15.733
There was blood everywhere.

01:38:15.766 --> 01:38:18.266
His life flooded away
before our eyes

01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:21.733
as he clutched the dead girl.

01:38:21.766 --> 01:38:25.800
Then his arms slowly slackened,

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:28.330
and the pumping blood
soaked her body

01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:30.333
so that her dead cheek

01:38:30.366 --> 01:38:32.866
flushed red again
with the bloodstain.

01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:47.233
So now they're together,

01:38:47.266 --> 01:38:52.466
two corpses married at last.

01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:56.633
Whom death hath joined,
no man can put asunder.

01:38:56.666 --> 01:39:00.633
They looked like honeymooners
together in one bed,

01:39:00.666 --> 01:39:03.400
evidence of the havoc
man can bring upon man

01:39:03.433 --> 01:39:06.566
by his own pigheadedness
and arrogance.

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:07.600
- Just a moment.

01:39:07.633 --> 01:39:09.666
- The queen has gone
without a word.

01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:12.533
- We've no indication of her feelings,
one way or the other.

01:39:12.566 --> 01:39:14.233
- I'm sure
she had good reasons.

01:39:14.266 --> 01:39:16.433
A public demonstration of grief
would be unlike her.

01:39:16.466 --> 01:39:18.900
She'll suffer like any other mother
for her son's death

01:39:18.933 --> 01:39:20.700
but in private, with her women.

01:39:20.733 --> 01:39:22.600
She'd never do anything
foolish or indiscreet.

01:39:22.633 --> 01:39:23.633
I'm sure of that.

01:39:23.666 --> 01:39:24.666
She's far too sensible.

01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:26.000
- I hope you're right.

01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:28.133
- Her silence was unnerving...

01:39:28.166 --> 01:39:30.366
- Dangerously unlike
what one would expect.

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.000
- That kind of silence
is sometimes

01:39:32.330 --> 01:39:34.100
more frightening
than screaming or tears.

01:39:34.133 --> 01:39:35.933
- I'll go in after her,

01:39:35.966 --> 01:39:37.733
just to make sure
that grief doesn't tempt her

01:39:37.766 --> 01:39:40.566
to anything silly or excessive.

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.233
You're right;
the silence was unnerving.

01:39:42.266 --> 01:39:44.566
She seemed to feel nothing,

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:46.800
and in my opinion,
that can be dangerous.

01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:09.366
- Look there.

01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:11.466
The king is coming

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:13.533
but not alone.

01:40:13.566 --> 01:40:17.000
A silent witness
comes before him,

01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:20.133
dead as stone...

01:40:20.166 --> 01:40:23.633
- Unspeaking evidence
that the crime,

01:40:23.666 --> 01:40:25.133
like the grief,

01:40:25.166 --> 01:40:27.433
is all his own.

01:40:27.466 --> 01:40:31.400
He suffers now
for his wrongdoing.

01:41:03.733 --> 01:41:07.330
- [sobbing]

01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:12.500
Pain!

01:41:14.666 --> 01:41:17.000
There was hatred inside me.

01:41:17.330 --> 01:41:19.866
The urge to destroy
drove me like a maniac

01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:24.330
in insane plunge towards death,

01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:27.300
your death, my boy.

01:41:27.333 --> 01:41:30.533
See here the victim
and his killer.

01:41:30.566 --> 01:41:34.330
See here the father and his son.

01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:37.166
I was responsible.
My actions killed him.

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:39.100
There is no blame for him,

01:41:39.133 --> 01:41:40.633
none.

01:41:40.666 --> 01:41:43.533
Blasted in the morning
of your life.

01:41:43.566 --> 01:41:49.200
My hope, my joy,
my hand powered the knife.

01:41:49.233 --> 01:41:51.800
My arrogance
determined your fate.

01:41:51.833 --> 01:41:53.666
- You see the truth now...

01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:56.133
- But you see it too late.

01:41:56.166 --> 01:42:00.500
- Suffering is
the only schoolteacher.

01:42:00.533 --> 01:42:03.533
The gods have broken my back,

01:42:03.566 --> 01:42:06.660
whipped me like a beast
up this stony crag

01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:09.600
and destroyed my self-respect.

01:42:09.633 --> 01:42:12.833
All pleasure, all rejoicing,

01:42:12.866 --> 01:42:16.500
they have turned
to anguish and weeping.

01:42:16.533 --> 01:42:20.333
Man is a naked, mortal creature;

01:42:20.366 --> 01:42:23.433
affliction is all
he can expect.

01:42:23.466 --> 01:42:25.600
- My lord,

01:42:25.633 --> 01:42:27.200
you have suffered enough,

01:42:27.233 --> 01:42:31.000
but more suffering
is marked to your name.

01:42:31.330 --> 01:42:34.330
One agony lies here in the open;
another is waiting,

01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:38.133
the same anguish redoubled
behind the door.

01:42:40.666 --> 01:42:43.233
- There can be nothing worse.

01:42:43.266 --> 01:42:44.733
My heart is broken.

01:42:44.766 --> 01:42:47.100
- But your wife,

01:42:47.133 --> 01:42:49.533
the mother
of this slaughtered son;

01:42:49.566 --> 01:42:50.933
her wound is still fresh,

01:42:50.966 --> 01:42:52.866
but the breath of life is gone.

01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:00.133
- Hades is deep, bottomless,

01:43:00.166 --> 01:43:01.833
the abyss of the dead.

01:43:01.866 --> 01:43:02.933
Will you kill me again

01:43:02.966 --> 01:43:04.500
or bring me to my knees
to suffer longer,

01:43:04.533 --> 01:43:07.366
beating my head insensible
with pain?

01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:09.133
What can you say,
messenger of death

01:43:09.166 --> 01:43:11.400
with a sad face,
more than you've said already?

01:43:11.433 --> 01:43:13.533
My way is towards the darkness.

01:43:13.566 --> 01:43:16.333
My case can be no worse
than it is.

01:43:16.366 --> 01:43:17.766
Can you kill me again?

01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:21.166
I'm dead already.

01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:23.500
Will there be more blood,

01:43:23.533 --> 01:43:25.200
more hacking of flesh,

01:43:25.233 --> 01:43:28.966
more savagery, more pain?

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.466
First the son, then the mother.

01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:33.100
No end to this grief?

01:43:33.133 --> 01:43:36.466
- Open the door
and see for yourself.

01:43:51.466 --> 01:43:53.966
- Unending,

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.666
unendurable pain.

01:43:57.700 --> 01:43:59.866
This is the second time
I'm forced to see

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:05.366
what no man's eyes
should ever see even once.

01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:07.660
Is this how it ends,

01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:10.200
or will there be more torture,
more suffering?

01:44:10.233 --> 01:44:13.166
A few moments ago, my trembling
arms embraced a dead son.

01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:16.500
Now grief has snatched
the mother from my hands.

01:44:16.533 --> 01:44:19.166
- It was there,
by the household shrine she stood,

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:20.933
still holding
the razor-sharp knife

01:44:20.966 --> 01:44:23.266
and as darkness drew down

01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:26.133
its slow blinds
and her eyes closed,

01:44:26.166 --> 01:44:27.500
she spoke of Megareus,

01:44:27.533 --> 01:44:30.000
who died in the fullness
of his youth,

01:44:30.330 --> 01:44:32.133
her elder boy.

01:44:32.166 --> 01:44:34.800
Nothing but good
was ever said of him.

01:44:34.833 --> 01:44:37.433
And she wept for the son
whose life ended today

01:44:37.466 --> 01:44:39.733
and with her last dying breath,

01:44:39.766 --> 01:44:42.660
cursed you as his murderer

01:44:42.100 --> 01:44:45.733
who drove him to this death.

01:44:45.766 --> 01:44:51.000
- I think I shall go mad
with terror.

01:44:51.330 --> 01:44:53.600
There must be a sword somewhere,

01:44:53.633 --> 01:44:56.766
a sharp two-edged knife
to cut away my life!

01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:58.666
Living is misery for me now,

01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:00.666
forever!

01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:03.933
Where I look,
I see blood everywhere.

01:45:03.966 --> 01:45:05.533
- It's no more
than the truth I've told.

01:45:05.566 --> 01:45:07.800
Her last word was to blame you

01:45:07.833 --> 01:45:10.766
for both deaths: mother and son.

01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:17.966
- How did she die?

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.333
Did she do it alone?

01:45:19.366 --> 01:45:20.833
- She heard them weeping;

01:45:20.866 --> 01:45:22.633
for Haemon, cried aloud

01:45:22.666 --> 01:45:26.333
and skewered herself
with her own small sword.

01:45:29.233 --> 01:45:33.333
- She spoke the truth.

01:45:33.366 --> 01:45:36.900
All the guilt is mine.

01:45:36.933 --> 01:45:40.133
I am the murderer.

01:45:40.166 --> 01:45:41.766
Make that plain.

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:50.166
Somebody,

01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:52.766
anybody, take me away.

01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:56.300
I disgrace
the decent light of day.

01:45:56.333 --> 01:45:58.400
I am nothing now.

01:45:58.433 --> 01:46:00.833
I have become nothing.

01:46:00.866 --> 01:46:03.800
Nothing can happen
to the man who is nothing.

01:46:03.833 --> 01:46:08.400
- How can we judge the best
in times like these?

01:46:08.433 --> 01:46:11.100
- Prompt action is safest.

01:46:11.133 --> 01:46:12.766
What more is there to lose?

01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:15.330
- I look for a friend now,

01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:17.500
the shadowy messenger
who runs swifter than the wind,

01:46:17.533 --> 01:46:21.330
to wrap me in darkness
as a friend should.

01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:23.133
Why waste another day?

01:46:23.166 --> 01:46:25.000
What good is daylight to me?

01:46:25.330 --> 01:46:29.766
Why should my misery darken
the face of another dawn?

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.600
Pull down the blind.

01:46:31.633 --> 01:46:34.400
- Tomorrow is a mystery.

01:46:34.433 --> 01:46:38.166
No man can say
what time will make plain.

01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:41.660
- We live day by day.

01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:44.100
The future is
in greater hands than ours.

01:46:44.133 --> 01:46:46.800
- I am nothing.

01:46:46.833 --> 01:46:49.233
I want nothing,

01:46:49.266 --> 01:46:52.660
my last simplest prayers.

01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:54.633
- Prayers are a waste of time.

01:46:54.666 --> 01:46:55.933
Why pray?

01:46:55.966 --> 01:46:58.933
- What must come will come

01:46:58.966 --> 01:47:01.200
tomorrow or today.

01:47:01.233 --> 01:47:05.500
- I'm nothing.

01:47:05.533 --> 01:47:07.330
Take me then:

01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:08.633
the man who killed
without knowing it

01:47:08.666 --> 01:47:12.100
his wife and son.

01:47:12.133 --> 01:47:14.300
Where should I go then?

01:47:14.333 --> 01:47:19.566
Left or right,
all wrong turnings now.

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:21.866
Into the night.

01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:25.100
Darkness hide me.

01:47:25.133 --> 01:47:27.566
There is blood on my hands.

01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:30.633
My head is split.

01:47:30.666 --> 01:47:34.133
My back is broken.

01:47:34.166 --> 01:47:35.933
I should be dead.

01:48:19.366 --> 01:48:21.833
- The key to human happiness

01:48:21.866 --> 01:48:24.333
is to nurture wisdom

01:48:24.366 --> 01:48:26.500
in your heart.

01:48:26.533 --> 01:48:29.700
- For man
to attend to man's business

01:48:29.733 --> 01:48:32.600
and let the gods
play their part.

01:48:32.633 --> 01:48:34.330
- Above all,

01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:35.933
to stand in awe

01:48:35.966 --> 01:48:39.500
of the eternal unalterable law.

01:48:39.533 --> 01:48:43.233
- The proud man may pretend,
in his arrogance,

01:48:43.266 --> 01:48:47.833
to despise everything
but himself.

01:48:47.866 --> 01:48:49.233
- In the end,

01:48:49.266 --> 01:48:52.833
the gods will bring him
to grief.

01:48:52.866 --> 01:48:55.500
- Today it has happened here.

01:48:55.533 --> 01:48:56.866
With our own eyes,

01:48:56.900 --> 01:49:00.766
we have seen an old man,
through suffering,

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.800
become wise.
