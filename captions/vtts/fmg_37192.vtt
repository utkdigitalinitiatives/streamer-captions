00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I'm Simran Sethi, and this is

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Ethical Markets the financial

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
lifestyle program reporting on

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the people and institutions

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
redefining success in the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.000
global marketplace.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
"We are what we eat."  And this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
week we'll look at how

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
individuals and enterprises

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
from all over

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the world are transforming the

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
way we grow and consume foods

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
through organic, sustainable,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
delicious and profitable

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
methods.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
* Frightening stories keep *

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
emerging in the media

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
about the safety of the food we

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
eat whether it's mad cows,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
mercury in fish, or dioxins in

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
breast milk the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
industrialization

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
of our food supplies, use

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
of persistent pesticides,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and disconnect between what we

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
eat and how our food is raised

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
has led

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
to the explosive growth

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
of clean,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
non-genetically-modified foods,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
organics,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and sustainable agriculture.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
For example, sales

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
of organic food increased by

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
over ten percent in the U.K.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
in 2004 and in America the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
organic market is projected to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
reach thirty-point-seven

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
billion dollars by 2007.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Rodale Press and Institute have

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
lead the way for decades.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Anthony Rodale, Chairman

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.000
of the Rodale Institute

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Our intention today here at the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Rodale Institute is

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to have more farmers transition

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
into organic farming

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
to meet the demand.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.000
We're committed to helping

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to train and educate farmers

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
to make the transition to a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
much more environmentally

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
friendly, regenerative way

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
of farming.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
In establishing the scientific

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
understanding

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
for organic farming,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
there was a realization that,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Wow, the soil is actually

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
improving while we are using

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
organic methods and techniques.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Simran Sethi

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.000
There are

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
currently a little over twelve

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
thousand organic farmers

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
in the United States which

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
represents

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
about point-five percent of the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
domestic farming population.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
This percentage can't keep up

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
with the demand

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
for organic food, so much of

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
the organics that are consumed

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
come from abroad.   And this

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
sets up an interesting dilemma

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
people want to eat well,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
but also want to support local

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
farmers and reduce the amount

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
of fossil fuel it takes

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
for food to get from the farm

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
to their forks.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Anthony Rodale, Chairman

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
of the Rodale Institute Food,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
when it's harvested, it begins

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
to change.  The life is cut

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
once the food is harvested

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
from the ground.   The

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
nutrients change as well.  And

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
if we eat foods that are grown

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
locally the food hasn't

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
traveled a long distance.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
The local and regional

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
agriculture and food system

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
provides an incredible security

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
for that region as well. So

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
it's something that people can

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
feel good about.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Gary Hirshberg, President &

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.000
CEO, Stonyfield Farm

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
If we all

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
could purchase everything

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
within fifteen miles,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
or even a hundred miles,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and it was organic,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
meaning produced

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
in a manner that's consistent

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
with natural principles, then

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
of course we should do that.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Unfortunately, 85%

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
of humanity is urban,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and most people can't do that.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So, it's important to us

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
at this stage in societal

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
evolution that we get organic

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
foods out there.  Ultimately as

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
fossil fuels costs go up, as

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
transportation  miles become

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
really expensive, as we start,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
like Europe has for decades,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
recognizing the true costs

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
of transportation, I think

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
agriculture will become more

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and more local or bioregional.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Anthony Rodale, Chairman

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.000
of the Rodale Institute

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
There's a lot of opportunities

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
for agribusinesses

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
to get involved, um,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
but it's really important

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
to understand that, you know,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
organic farming was not created

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
just to become a niche industry.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It was really created

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
to change all of agriculture

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
in this country and

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
around the world.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And I think that organic

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
farming standards can really

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
bring much more transparency to

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the agricultural industry as a

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
whole.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Thomas Fricke, Co-Founder,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Forestrade, Inc.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.000
We have to be certified

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
organic, that means we're

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
required really to work

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
at the grass roots and

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
from the ground up.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So we work actually with, now,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
over 8,000 individual farmers

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
in hundreds of locations

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
around the world.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Organics for us,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
it is a whole systems approach,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
it really allows us to make a

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
connection as a consumer. It

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
enables us to really make a

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
personal relationship and

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
to really have an impact on

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
protecting and preserving the

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
way of life

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
of the producers and also,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
helping to protect some very

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
important natural eco-systems,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
so we really need to be

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
attentive and really very much

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.000
engaged with local cultural

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
practices, mores, and

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
values.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Anthony Rodale, Chairman

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.000
of the Rodale Institute

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Many people believe that organic

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.000
farming cannot get the

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
appropriate yields.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Well, we found through one

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
of the worst droughts ever on

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
our farm that the organic

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
yields were superior

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
to the conventional yields.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And, also, too, this year we

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
realized being a very wet year

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
that the organic crop actually

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
outperformed the conventional

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
crop.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.000
In general, an average year, we

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
see that the crop yields are

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
pretty much the same.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Supermarkets have only been

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
in existence for 40 years.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Before that, people got most of

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
their food locally and

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
regionally. They lived

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
within seasons and cycles.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Today, you can get foods

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
at anytime of the year because

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
people are demanding it.   The

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
importance of the local and the

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
regional movement that is

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
happening today is people

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
wanting to reconnect. The story

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
of someone buying a great

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
cheese that's grown locally

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
that has a story behind the

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
farm provides an incredible

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
educational awareness.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
People love to talk

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
about food, and it provides

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
another great way

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
to connect other people to

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
foods that are grown locally

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
originally.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Simran Sethi

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Witnessing the

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.000
exponential growth

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
of the natural food industry,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
agribusiness has also entered

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the arena, creating its own

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
healthy products and buying up

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
smaller organic and clean-food

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
companies.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Seeds of Change is now owned

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
by M & M Mars, Ben and Jerry's

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
is owned by Unilever, Boca

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Foods is owned by Altria and

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Horizon Organics and Silk Soy

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Milk are owned by Dean

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Foods.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Gary Hirshberg explains how the

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
sale of Stonyfield Farm

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
to consumer products giant

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Danone has impacted his

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
business.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Gary Hirshberg, President &

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.000
CEO, Stonyfield Farm

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
One of my

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.000
proudest achievements

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
in 22 years of running this

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
company has been the marriage

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
with Group Danone, and I use

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
the word "marriage"

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
intentionally.  This has most

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
definitely not been an

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
acquisition.  We have an

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
independent Board of

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Directors, I still have a

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
majority of board seats, even

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
though I'm only now a twenty

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
percent owner.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.000
But truly, in three years,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Danone has proven that they are

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
much more sitting

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
in the bleachers cheering us

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
on than anything else.   They

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
put no money

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
into the company, the money

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that they used...that they

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
spent, was

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
to take our investors out,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and they got an excellent

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
return on investment. Now where

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I spend the bulk

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
of my time is working

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
on a number of organic

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
initiatives globally. I,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Danone is a global company.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
I really do believe that we are

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
one of those little spores

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
inside Danone that will really

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
greatly change the way that

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
they do business.   I believed

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
deeply from the

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
beginning that

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Stoneyfield

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
by ourselves was not going

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
to save the planet. That what

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
we needed to do was

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
to serve as a model,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that we can show large

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
companies,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
established companies the way.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Frankly, McDonalds,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Coca-Cola, General Mills,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Danone can do more good

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
with one purchase order than I

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
may do in a lifetime.  And

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
indeed, if any one of those

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
companies made a real

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
aggressive commitment

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
to organic,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
it would change the world.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Now, Stoneyfield is changing

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
the world also, just on a much

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
slower scale. I really believe

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
it's our moral obligation and

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
mandate to change these

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
companies. And

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
it's a great opportunity

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
for these companies, and

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Danone has really recognized

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
that, and that's why they left

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
us so independent.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Simran Sethi

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
The nutritional

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.000
food company Clif Bar has

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
sustained and succeeded

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
without corporate backing.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.000
The company's Luna Nutrition

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Bar For Women has outsold

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Nestlé's power-bars to become

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
the best-selling energy and

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
nutrition bars

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
in grocery stores,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
which supports founder Gary

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Erickson's commitment

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
to private ownership.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Gary Erickson, Founder, Clif

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Bar

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I got Clif Bar started

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
because I was a consumer

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.000
of a product that wasn't

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
working for me.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I was bicycle racing,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and doing tours in the Alps,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
and one day I was

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
on a long bike ride,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and I took on this ride, 6

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
of the only energy bar

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
on the market in 1990, and

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
after about 125 miles

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
on this ride, I had eaten 5

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
of the 6 bars, and I had 50

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
miles to go on this ride,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and I needed fuel, I needed

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
to eat something, but I looked

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
at this last one,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and I just couldn't do it,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
so that was

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
for me that was both a moment

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
of inspiration and an epiphany,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
that I could make something

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
better than this, and I did.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
The business grew from a 700

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
thousand dollar business in

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
1992 to 40 million dollars

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
by the year 1999,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
in annual sales

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
without any investors.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
So privately held, 2 partners

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
50/50.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Our two largest competitors,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Power Bar and Balance Bar were

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
purchased by the two largest

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
food companies in the world

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Nestle and Kraft.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
So now we're this small

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Berkley, hippie-company sort

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
of competing against the two

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
largest food companies

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
in the world.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.000
The experts from the outside

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
world were telling us, You're

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
never going to be able

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
to compete,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I mean you did a great job,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
you're an entrepreneur,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
you built your company,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
but it is time you think

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
about exiting or bringing

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
on some investors.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So in an uncharacteristic

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
moment for myself,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
because I am willing to take

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
on risk, I fell into the trap

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
of believing that we couldn't

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
make it,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and the company was put up

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
for sale.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Here's a guy who used to live

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
in a garage,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
down the street here in

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Berkley

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
with no heat and no bathroom,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
making 10 thousand dollars a

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
year.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And now I have a chance

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
to walk away with 60 million

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
dollars.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
In my heart, at the last

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
minute, literally 2 hours

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
before walking away

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
with the money, I took a walk

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
down around the block here and

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
half way

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
around the block I decided not

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
to do it.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I feel the only way to make

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
sure that this vision stays

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
alive and is sustained is

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
to remain privately held, and

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
in our case, we believe that

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
having 100% ownership makes it

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
even that much easier.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Simran Sethi

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Clif bars are

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
never made with genetically

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
modified ingredients.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Genetically modified organisms

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
or GMOs have been heralded as

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
the answer

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
to poverty and malnutrition

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
by industrial food companies.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
However, fears over the health

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
and environmental risks

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
associated with these

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
genetically modified foods have

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
escalated the public debate.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Large-scale food manufacturers

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
GMO, organic or otherwise -

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
have not only impacted

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
small-scale providers in the

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
United States,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
but have deeply affected

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
farmers

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
in developing nations such as

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Thailand where agriculture

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
remains the primary source

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
of livelihood.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Nicola Bullard, Focus

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.000
on the Global South

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
The important thing to

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.000
know about

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Thailand is that more than 60%

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
of the people are engaged

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
in agricultural production.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
In the past 20 or 25 years

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
there has been a real

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
transformation

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
in the agricultural sector.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
It's become very oriented

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
towards exporting food,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
rather than growing food

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
for local production.  What

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
this has meant is that

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
agribusiness, and large scale

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
agriculture production has

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
become the norm.   Now of

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
course the local farmers are

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
really suffering the

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
consequences of this, in many

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
respects because they are

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
losing a lot of autonomy.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
They're being pushed

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
into producing food

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
for exports.   They have very

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
little control

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
over the market,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
they have no say

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
over the price

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
of what they grow.  Obviously

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
if the price of rice,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
or the price of soybean,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
or the price of onions falls,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
then the farmer still has the

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
same cost for putting

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
in the fertilizers,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
the labor they put in, the

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
seeds, and so

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
on and so forth.   Many

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
of them are much more

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
in debt now than they were even

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
20 years ago.  In the 60's 20%

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
of rural households had debt

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and now 80%

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
of rural households have debt.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
So the farmers have really

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
tried to organize themselves,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
to find solutions

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
to this problem, to find ways

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
to feed their families,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
to get good prices

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
for their food

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
to resist the imposition

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
of certain kinds of seeds,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
certain kinds of pesticides and

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
fertilizers and so on.

scientist Vandana Shiva has

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
also helped inspire farmers and

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
consumers to action and is

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
shaping public policy and

corporate procedure

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
in the process.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Vandana Shiva, Founder,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Navdanya

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.000
The vicious cycle

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
of industrialized,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
globalized agriculture is based

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
on three very,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
very big myths. First that

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
industrial agriculture with

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
chemicals and genetically

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
engineered seed produces more

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
food.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
It does not. I spent 15 years

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
of my scientific life working

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
on ecosystems and farming

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
systems that are biodiverse,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
organic,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
ecological and they have tens

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
to 100s

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
of times more productivity

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
without using any external

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
resources. The second big myth

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
is that globalized agriculture

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
is based on competition. No,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
it's based on five giant

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
agri-business corporations

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
controlling input, distribution

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
and the consumer price. The

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
third very big myth is it's

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
based on self-generating

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
surpluses.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Even the United States is not a

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
food surplus country. It is

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
importing more food than it's

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
exporting. What the system has

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
done is created what we call a

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
great food swap.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Everyone is exporting and

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
everyone is importing. Only the

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
trading agribusiness are making

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
a buck

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
in exporting and importing.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Their profits shoot up. But

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
meantime the small farmer

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
disappears. Consumer health is

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
destroyed with one third of

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
America suffering

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
from the obesity epidemic.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Nicola Bullard, Focus on the

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Global South In Thailand you

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
really have fantastic movements

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
of farmers organized in

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
alternative production systems,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
creating local markets,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000
re-capturing a lot

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
of the old technologies,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
the diversity

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
in the seed production,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
in the kinds

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
of rice that they grow.   And

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.000
they're really trying

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
to carve out, if you like,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
not a direct challenge

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
to the agribusiness,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
but they're trying

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
to find a way

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
for them not only to survive

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
but to prosper.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Vandana Shiva, Founder,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Navdanya

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I think every one

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
of us has an obligation

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
to be a co-producer

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
of a sustainable healthy, just,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
peaceful economy of food.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
The small farmer still accounts

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
for the largest number

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
of producers. But every one

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
of us,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
even those who don't live on

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
the land are co-producer

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
because the moment we make a

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
choice about what food we eat

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
we are choosing the production

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
system we support.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
In the very act of eating we

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
are shaping the economy.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
In the very act of eating we

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
decide whether the small farmer

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
will survive or agribusiness

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
will have more profits.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
We're really creating a new

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
model, which is,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
that doesn't fit into the neat

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
boxes such as a broker, or a

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
trader, or importer.  We are

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
really catalysts for what I

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
call multi-stakeholder

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
partnerships - farmers,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
entrepreneurs, co-operatives,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
warehouses, and a number,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
a number of companies in both

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
U.S. and Europe that are our

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
partners, that are helping

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
to really get the story out,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
that are really helping

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
to build the market.

of the Rodale Institute The

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
more that people get

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
into growing food organically

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
to meet the incredible demand

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
prices will start

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
to come down.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
How do we get healthier,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
fresher foods

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
into the urban areas, into the

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
rural areas where people's

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
diets aren't always the best?

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
And it is

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
by farmer's markets, by getting

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
your local supermarket

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
to have local foods, and also

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
to the direct connection

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
with the farmer

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
to the local consumer.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
There's an abundant, diverse

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
ways where we can show these

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
examples of success around the

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
country and internationally.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.000
* Simran Sethi

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
In North America *

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
the largest organic farming

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
co-operative is Organic

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Valley.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
The company is the only organic

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.000
brand solely owned and operated

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
by organic farmers.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And today we're joined

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
by its CEO, George Siemon and

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Hewson Baltzell, our

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
stakeholder analyst and the

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Co-Founder of Innovest

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Strategic Value Advisors.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.000
I wonder if you could start

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
off just telling us

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
about co-operative structure?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
What exactly does that mean?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.000
George Siemon

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Well, a co-op is

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.000
much like any corporation

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
except that it's built on

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
serving its owners rather than

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
serving them

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
through building valuation.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Hewson Baltzell

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
George, how

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
does the actual governance

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
structure work in the co-op?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
George Siemon

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Well, of course,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
we're like any

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:19.000
business where we have a

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
corporate board, and that kind

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
of thing,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
which is all farmers.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:23.000
But besides that we,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
of course, our co-op has milk

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
and eggs and juice and a wide

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
variety of products and food

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
products and so each of those

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
groups has there own governance

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
board and so they all sit

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
down and talk about all the

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
issues that affect them whether

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
it be quality standards or

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
organic standards or supply

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
management or their contracts,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
their agreements, their pay

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
price,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
so it really gives them a place

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
to really engage

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
in the business

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
on a monthly basis.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
And then we go through a lot,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
we send out very good minutes

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
that describe the processes

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
because we believe the educated

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
farmer is the one that best

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
will make it to the future.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Hewson Baltzell

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
You have

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
something called the We The

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Farmers Pledge, so what exactly

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
is that?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.000
George Siemon

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.000
We have different

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
standards that we have come up

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
with, we have a pledge, we have

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
a membership agreement and we

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
have an affidavit process.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.000
We make sure farmers that

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
really understand they're

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
really signing up for more than

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
just a marketplace they're

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
joining something.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:15.000
As well we make them invest in

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
our co-op and that really is a

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
sign of commitment.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Simran Sethi

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
George, what do

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
you do to ensure that the

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
farmers are adhering

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
to the organic standards?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.000
George Siemon

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.000
The most

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
important thing, I think, is

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
just the peer pressure they get

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.000
from their own farmers, you

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
know, so

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
by having the regional reps

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.000
in every region there's a lot

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
of contact.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
If there are issues,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
we've got a person near

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
by that can check into it.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Of course, rumors is a great

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
integrity check.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Hewson Baltzell

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
You also have

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
some programs that help

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
stabilize income, that is

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
to say that

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
in the market the price

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
of milk moves up and down and

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
that can be destabilizing

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
for the family farm.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Can you talk about that?

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
George Siemon

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Sure, one

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
of our biggest goals when we

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.000
set out was to try to make

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
farmers have a sustainable

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
living, have a stable income so

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
they can plan their life.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
And, so, one of our greatest

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
accomplishments has been just

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
that and it's part of the whole

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
organic dairy industry rewards,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
and so farmers can literally

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
plan on what they're going

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
to get paid this year

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
for their business purposes.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Sure, there might be a little

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
variation here or there

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.000
but not anything noticeable.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Simran Sethi

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
And your regional

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.000
distribution system allows

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
people to purchase their goods

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
locally, right?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
So the farmers the organic

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
family products that they're

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
purchasing are actually created

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
by farmers that are

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
in the region.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
George Siemon

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:25.000
People want

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
to reward farmers

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
for doing something right.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
And that's so unique and

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
farmers are eager to be part

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
of that so one of the things

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
our farmers really want

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
to do is

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
to have local production.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
So, if we're in the New

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
England area, we have,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
our milk is labeled New

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
England Pastures.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
So farmers can take pride

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
in having their milk

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
at the local store.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.000
We get them involved in the

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
marketing; we have them go

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
to demos or speak at trade

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
shows or anything we can do

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
to get them

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
out there and really put

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
on their local face.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
The natural infrastructure we

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
have enables us to work with

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
all the bigger chains and all

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
the regulations and all that

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
but then by having the regional

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
pools and the regional

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
governance we're able also to

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
address the needs that people

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
have in their region and make

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
that connection between the

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
consumers and the farmers right

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
there.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Simran Sethi

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:09.000
What is your

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
relationship with chains?

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Would Organic Valley products

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
be available in a place like

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
WalMart?

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.000
George Siemon

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
We focus

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:16.000
on the natural food trade.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
That's our natural home, you

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
know, but we certainly sell

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
to the bigger chains as well.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Hewson Baltzell

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.000
What about

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
actual certification? I know

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
there are debates

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
about how rigorous organic is.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Does that affect your business

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
and do you have an opinion

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
about that regulation?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:35.000
George Siemon

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Well, certification, I think,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.000
is a very valid system.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
We're now part of the USDA

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
which has given us some merit

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
and recognition as a mature

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
industry.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Of course, it's brought its own

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
headaches, too, to work

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
within the government.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
But I feel the certification

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
system works.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Hewson Baltzell

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
What about

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
the premium that you have

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
to pay for, let's say,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
a gallon of milk that's organic

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
versus the commercial brand?

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
How do you justify that

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
to consumers?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:04.000
George Siemon

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Well, there's

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:05.000
three issues, basically.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
One, there's additional costs

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
if you buy feed, for example,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
or whatever, your organic

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
feed's quite expensive and

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
quite in short supply,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
so there are additional costs.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Two, unfortunately,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
we're trying to overcome what

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
might be called a bankrupt food

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
system of farmers going out

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
of business every day.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
So we're trying

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
to get those people up

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
to a sustainable living.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.000
And three,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
we're still inefficient.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
People are charging higher

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.000
margins,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
we've got more hauling miles,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
we've got more line losswe're

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
still at this stage.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
I mean, we're quite proud,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
we're 3% of the organic milk

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
mar - of the milk market now -

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
is organic milk and that's a

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
huge accomplishment compared

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
to where we were 10 years ago,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
but still we are suffering from

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
&ome inefficiencies we hope

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
and higher margins along the

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
way that we hope might

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
decrease over time.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Simran Sethi

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Well, I want

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
to thank both of you

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
for joining us today.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Now a commentary from Hazel

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Henderson futurist, author

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
of Building a Win-Win World and

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
the creator of this series.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Hazel Henderson

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Today, industrially-processed

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:01.000
food -

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
whether canned, dried, frozen

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
or preserved is losing favor

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
among upscale consumers.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Even cooking food reduces its

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
nutritional value somewhat.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
So salad bars and raw natural

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
organically grown foods are

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
featured in many trendy

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
restaurants.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
All this means that such foods

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
must be meticulously grown and

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
cleaned.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Many still need pasteurizing,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
including milk and fruit

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
juices.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Upscale, health-conscious

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
consumers are also looking for

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
produce and foods

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
uncontaminated with pesticides

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
and toxics,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
like mercury,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
which concentrates

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
in the food chain.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Britain's National Consumer

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Counsel offers a

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Health-Responsibility Index

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
rating supermarkets

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
to protect children from junk

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
foods and growing childhood

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
obesity.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Many parents have succeeded

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
in ridding schools of junk

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
foods and sugar filled soft

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
drink vending machines.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Today, as you learned

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
on this show, organically grown

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
produce cannot keep up

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
with consumer demand, growing

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
at 20% per year!

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
The U.S. still has

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
to import organics.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
The irony is that just as

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
people know their health

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
benefits, they must battle

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
to get clear labels

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
on other foods to know whether

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
they contain

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
genetically-modified organisms

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
GMOs.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
European consumers, unlike

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Americans, have so far been

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
vigilant about GMO labeling.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Laws there prevent sale

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
of GMO-containing foods.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Now, large GMO producers are

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
also buying up seed companies.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
In today's globalized economy,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
all these changes

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
in our food supply affect

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
people in perverse and very

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
different ways.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000
The patenting of native plants

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
has provoked many national

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
movements to protect them.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
In the USA, Europe and Japan,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
contract agriculture is

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
growing. Consumers form groups

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
and contract

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
with local farmers to grow

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
customized organic crops.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Markets for clean food are

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
growing

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
at 16% annually versus 4%

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
for supermarket chains.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Luckily, healthy alternatives

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
are now widely available

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
in health food stores,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
supermarkets, restaurants, your

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
local farmers market and ask

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
for them in supermarkets,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
too.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Bon appetit!

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
I'm Hazel Henderson.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.000
And that will conclude this

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
edition of Ethical Markets.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Thanks for watching.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Keep being the change you wish

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
to see in the world,

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
and we'll see you soon.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Coming up on future episodes:

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
socially responsible investing

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
and healthy living.
