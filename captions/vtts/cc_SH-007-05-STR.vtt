00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200


2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.400
How bloodily the sun begins topeer above yon busky hill.

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.770
The day looks pale at hisdistemperature.

4
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.270
The southern wind doth play thetrumpet to his purposes,

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.230
and, by his hollow whistling inthe leaves,

6
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.930
foretells a tempest and ablustering day.

7
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.500
Then with the losers let itsympathize,

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.330
for nothing can seem foul tothose that win.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.630
How now, my Lord of Worcester.

10
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.170
'Tis not well that you and Ishould meet

11
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.900
upon such terms as now we meet.

12
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.430
You have deceived our trust

13
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.900
and made us doff our easy robesof peace

14
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.670
to crush our old limbs inungentle steel.

15
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.730
This is not well, my lord.

16
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.300
This is not well.

17
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.000
What say you to it?

18
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.970
Will you again unknit thischurlish knot

19
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.970
of all-abhorred war

20
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.800
And move in that obedient orbagain

21
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.870
where you did give a fair andnatural light

22
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.600
and be no more an exhaledmeteor,

23
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.300
a prodigy of fear and a portentof mischief

24
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.470
to the unborn times?

25
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.170
Hear me, my liege.

26
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.400
For mine own part, I could bewell content

27
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.800
to entertain the lag-end of mylife with quiet hours,

28
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.900
for I protest,

29
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.400
I have not sought the day ofthis dislike.

30
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.730
You have not sought it?

31
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.630
How comes it, then?

32
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.870
Rebellion lay in his way, and hefound it.

33
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.030
Peace, chewet, peace!

34
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.130
It pleased your majesty to turnyour looks of favor

35
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.370
from myself and all our house.

36
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.500
And yet I must remember you, mylord,

37
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.070
we were the first and dearest ofyour friends.

38
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.270
For you, my staff of office didI break In Richard's time

39
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.230
and posted day and night to meetyou on the way

40
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.400
and kiss your hand,

41
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.230
while yet you were in place andin account

42
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.000
nothing so strong and fortunateas I.

43
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It was myself, my brother, andhis son

44
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.200
who brought you home

45
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.400
and boldly did outdare thedangers of the time.

46
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.370
And being fed by us, you used usso

47
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.700
as that ungentle gull, thecuckoo's bird,

48
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.770
useth the sparrow: did oppressour nest,

49
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.070
grew by our feeding to so greata bulk

50
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.200
that even our love durst notcome near your sight

51
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.500
for fear of swallowing.

52
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.270
But with nimble wing, we wereenforced,

53
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.670
for safety sake, to fly out ofyour sight

54
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.370
and raise this present head,

55
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.070
whereby we stand opposed by suchmeans

56
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.200
as you yourself have forgedagainst yourself

57
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.770
by unkind usage, dangerouscountenance,

58
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.770
and violation of all faith andtroth

59
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.670
sworn to us in your youngerenterprise!

60
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.930
These things indeed you havearticulate,

61
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.000
proclaim'd at market-crosses,read in churches,

62
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.970
to face the garment of rebellionwith some fine color

63
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.200
that may please the eye

64
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.900
of fickle changelings and poordiscontents,

65
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.730
which gape and rub the elbow atthe news

66
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.270
o hurlyburly innovation.

67
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.130
And never yet did insurrectionwant

68
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.370
such water-colors to impaint hiscause,

69
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.770
nor moody beggars, starving fora time

70
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.100
of pellmell havoc and confusion.

71
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.770
In both our armies, there ismany a soul

72
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.630
shall pay full dearly for thisencounter

73
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.500
if once they join in trial.

74
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.600
Tell your nephew the Prince ofWales

75
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.770
doth join with all the world inpraise of Henry Percy.

76
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.900
By my hopes, this presententerprise set off his head,

77
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.030
I do not think a bravergentleman,

78
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.270
more active-valiant or morevaliant-young,

79
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.670
more daring or more bold, is nowalive

80
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.600
to grace this latter age withnoble deeds.

81
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.970
For my part, I may speak it tomy shame,

82
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.900
I have a truant been tochivalry,

83
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.470
and so I hear he doth account metoo.

84
00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.500
Yet this before my father'smajesty.

85
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.500
I am content that he shall takethe odds

86
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.400
of his great name and estimation

87
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.630
and will, to save the blood oneither side,

88
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.430
try fortune with him in a singlefight.

89
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.500
And, Prince of Wales, so dare weventure thee,

90
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.130
albeit considerations infinitedo make against it.

91
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.300
No, good Worcester, no.

92
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.470
We love our people well.

93
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.430
Even those we love

94
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.430
that are misled upon yourcousin's part.

95
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.430
And, will they take the offer ofour grace,

96
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.500
both he and they and you,yea,every man,

97
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.000
shall be my friend again andI'll be his.

98
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.930
So tell your cousin,

99
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.470
and bring me word what he willdo.

100
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.200
But if he will not yield,

101
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.170
rebuke and dread correction waiton us,

102
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.630
and they shall do their office.

103
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.870
So be gone.

104
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.430
We will not now be troubled withreply.

105
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.500
We offer fair.

106
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.330
Take it advisedly.

107
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.600
It will not be accepted, on mylife.

108
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.870
The Douglas and the Hotspur bothtogether

109
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.470
are confident against the worldin arms.

110
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.100
Hence, therefore, every leaderto his charge,

111
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.970
for, on their answer, will weset on them.

112
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.470
And God befriend us,as our causeis just!

113
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:42.600
Hal, if thou see me down in thebattle and bestride me, so.

114
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.700
'Tis a point of friendship.

115
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.400
Nothing but a colossus can dothee that friendship.

116
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.300
Say thy prayers, and farewell.

117
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.500
I--

118
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.030
I would 'twere bed-time, Hal,and all well.

119
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.000
Why, thou owest God a death.

120
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.130
'Tis not due yet!

121
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.800
I would be loath to pay himbefore his day.

122
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.270
What need I be so forward withhim that calls not on me?

123
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.270
Well, 'tis no matter; honorpricks me on.

124
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.770
Yea, but how if honor prick meoff when I come on?

125
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.400
How then?

126
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.900
Can honor set to a leg?

127
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.300
No, or an arm?

128
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:32.270
No, or take away the grief of awound?

129
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.500
No.

130
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.100
Honor hath then no skill insurgery?

131
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.100
No.

132
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.330
What is honor?

133
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.770
A word.

134
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.070
What is in that word "honor"?

135
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.500
What is that honor?

136
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.400
Air.

137
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.770
A trim reckoning.

138
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.200
Who hath it?

139
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.000
He that died o' Wednesday.

140
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.230
Doth he feel it?

141
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.900
No.

142
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.530
Doth he hear it?

143
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.470
No.

144
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.370
'Tis insensible, then

145
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.100
Yea, to the dead.

146
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.730
But will it not live with theliving?

147
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.430
No.

148
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.530
Why?

149
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.570
Detraction will not suffer it.

150
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.170
Therefore, I'll none of it.

151
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.530
Honor is a mere scutcheon.

152
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.600
And so ends my catechism.

153
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.930
O, no, Sir Richard, my nephewmust not know

154
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.070
the liberal and kind offer ofthe king.

155
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.100
'Twere best he did.

156
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.430
Then are we all undone.

157
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.170
It is not possible, it cannotbe,

158
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.070
the king should keep his word inloving us.

159
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.330
He will suspect us still andfind a time

160
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.170
to punish this offense in otherfaults.

161
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.670
Therefore, dear cousin, let notHarry know,

162
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:05.000
in any case, the offer of theking.

163
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Deliver what you will; I'll say'tis so.

164
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.670
My uncle is return'd.

165
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.730
Deliver up my Lord ofWestmoreland.

166
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:15.870
Uncle, what news?

167
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.600
The king will bid you battlepresently.

168
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.670
Defy him by the Lord ofWestmoreland.

169
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.030
Lord Douglas, go you and tellhim so.

170
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.300
Marry, I shall, and verywillingly.

171
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.000
There's no seeming mercy in theking.

172
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Did you beg any?

173
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.200
God forbid.

174
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.830
I told him gently of ourgrievances,

175
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.770
of his oath-breaking, which hemended thus

176
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.530
by now forswearing that he isforsworn.

177
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.470
He calls us rebels, traitors,

178
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.800
will purge with haughty armsthis hateful name in us.

179
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.030
Arm, gentlemen; to arms.

180
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.330
I have thrown a brave defiancein King Harry's teeth,

181
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.530
and Westmoreland, that wasengaged, did bear it.

182
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.200
This cannot choose but bring himquickly on.

183
00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.000
The Prince of Wales stepp'dforth before the king

184
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.830
and, nephew, challenged you tosingle fight.

185
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.400
Oh, would to God the quarrel layupon our heads

186
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.900
and that no man might draw shortbreath today

187
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.530
but I and Harry Monmouth.

188
00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:12.130
Tell me, tell me, how show'd histasking?

189
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:13.400
Seem'd it in contempt?

190
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.330
No, by my soul, I never in mylife

191
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.200
did hear a challenge urged moremodestly,

192
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.100
unless a brother should abrother dare

193
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.130
to gentle exercise and proof ofarms.

194
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:22.700
He gave you all the virtues of aman,

195
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.070
trimm'd up your praises with aprincely tongue,

196
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:26.930
spoke to your deserving like achronicle,

197
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.200
making you ever better than hispraise

198
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.730
by still dispraising praisevalued with you.

199
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.900
And, which became him like aprince indeed,

200
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.500
he made a blushing cital ofhimself

201
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.430
and chid his truant youth withsuch a grace

202
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.700
as if he master'd there a doublespirit,

203
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.770
of teaching and of learninginstantly.

204
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.000
There did he pause.

205
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.070
But let me tell the world,

206
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.600
if he outlive the envy of thisday,

207
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.600
England did never own so sweet ahope,

208
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.870
so much misconstrued in hiswantonness.

209
00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.500
Cousin, I think thou artenamored of his follies.

210
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.970
Never did I hear of any princeso wild a libertine.

211
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.330
But be he as he will, yet onceere night

212
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.630
I will embrace him with asoldier's arm

213
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.700
that he shall shrink under mycourtesy.

214
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.000
Arm, arm with speed.

215
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And, fellows, soldiers, friends,

216
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.530
better consider what you have todo than I,

217
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.630
that have not well the gift oftongue,

218
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.400
can lift your blood up withpersuasion.

219
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.470
My lord, here are letters foryou.

220
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.570
I cannot read them now.

221
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.730
Oh, gentlemen, the time of lifeis short.

222
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:40.330
To spend that shortness baselywere too long,

223
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:41.970
if life did ride upon a dial'spoint,

224
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.730
still ending at the arrival ofan hour.

225
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.170
An if we live, we live to treadon kings;

226
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:51.670
if die, brave death, whenprinces die with us.

227
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.130
Now, for our consciences, thearms are fair

228
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.270
when the intent of bearing themis just.

229
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.730
My lord, prepare.

230
00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.500
The king comes on apace.

231
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.300
I thank him that he cuts me frommy tale,

232
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.730
for I profess not talking, onlythis:

233
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:10.270
let each man do his best.

234
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:15.970
And here draw I a sword, whosetemper I intend to stain

235
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.100
with the best blood that I canmeet withal

236
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.570
in the adventure of thisperilous day.

237
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.500
Now, Esperance.

238
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.930
Percy.

239
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.700
And set on.

240
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.530
Sound all the lofty instrumentsof war,

241
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:43.970
and, by that music, let us allembrace.

242
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.800
For, heaven to earth, some of usnever shall

243
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.970
a second time do such acourtesy.

244
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.930
What is thy name,

245
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.030
that in this battle thus thoucrossest me?

246
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.070
What honors dost thou seek uponmy head?

247
00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.370
Know then, my name is Douglas;

248
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.230
and I do haunt thee in battlethus

249
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.900
because some tell me thou art aking.

250
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.070
They tell thee true.

251
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.970
My Lord of Stafford dear todayhath bought thy likeness,

252
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.130
for instead of thee, King Harry,this sword has ended him,

253
00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.670
which shall it thee,

254
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.570
unless thou yield thee as myprisoner.

255
00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:57.570
I was not born a yielder, thouproud Scot,

256
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.370
and thou shalt find a king

257
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.830
that will revenge LordStafford's death.

258
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.870
Ohm Douglas, hadst thou foughtat Holmedon thus,

259
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.400
never had triumph'd upon a Scot.

260
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.970
All's done. All's won.

261
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.170
See; here, breathless lies theking.

262
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.170
Where?

263
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:31.830
Here.

264
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.130
This, Douglas?

265
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.970
No, I know this face full well.

266
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.030
A gallant knight he was.

267
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.000
His name was Blunt.

268
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.270
Semblably furnish'd like theking himself.

269
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.530
A fool go with thy soul, whitherit will.

270
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.470
A borrow'd title hast thoubought too dear.

271
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.730
Why didst thou tell me thou werta king?

272
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.570
The king has many marching inhis coats.

273
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:54.800
Then, by my sword, I will killall his coats.

274
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.800
I'll murder all his wardrobe,piece by piece,

275
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.600
until I find the king.

276
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.770
Up, and away!

277
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.800
Our soldiers stand full fairlyfor the day!

278
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.670
This way! Follow me!

279
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.700
Follow him, lads!

280
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.270
Come on! Hurry!

281
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.830
Come on, men!

282
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.730
Though I could 'scape shot-freeat London,

283
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:15.970
yet I fear the shot here.

284
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:17.870
Here's no scoring but upon thepate.

285
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:18.900
Soft!

286
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.570
Who are you?

287
00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.670
Sir Walter Blunt.

288
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.700
There's honor for you.

289
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.130
I'm as hot as molten lead and asheavy.

290
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.000
God keep lead out of me!

291
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.300
I need no more weight than mineown bowels.

292
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.530
I have led my ragamuffins wherethey are peppered.

293
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.830
There's not three of my hundredand fifty left alive.

294
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.100
And they are for the town's end,to beg during life.

295
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.570
But who comes here?

296
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:42.630
What?

297
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:43.970
Stand'st thou idle here?

298
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:44.970
What?

299
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.670
Lend me thy sword.

300
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.430
Many a nobleman lies stark andstiff

301
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.100
under the hoofs of vauntingenemies,

302
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.870
whose deaths are yet unrevenged.

303
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.170
I prithee, lend me thy sword!

304
00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.570
Oh, Hal, I prithee, give meleave to breathe awhile.

305
00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.470
Turk Gregory never did suchdeeds in arms

306
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:58.700
as I have done this day.

307
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.500
I have paid Percy. I have madehim sure.

308
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.230
He is, indeed, and living tokill thee.

309
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:03.530
I prithee, lend me thy sword!

310
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.300
Nay, before God, Hal, if Percybe alive,

311
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.430
thou get'st not my sword.

312
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.170
Take my pistol, if thou wilt.

313
00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.200
Give it to me.

314
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.600
What, is it in the case?

315
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.030
Ay, 'tis hot. 'Tis hot.

316
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.330
There's that will sack a city.

317
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.470
What?

318
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:20.030
Is it a time to jest and dallynow?

319
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:23.900
Well, if Percy be alive, I'llpierce him.

320
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.230
If he do come in my way, so.

321
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.470
If he do not, if I come in hiswillingly,

322
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.200
let him make a carbonado of me.

323
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.070
I like not such grinning honoras Sir Walter hath.

324
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.730
Give me life, which, if I cansave, so.

325
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.400
If not, honor comes unlookedfor,

326
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.530
and there's an end.

327
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.300
This way! Follow me!

328
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.030
I prithee, Harry, withdrawthyself.

329
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.270
Thou bleed'st too much.

330
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.070
Lord John of Lancaster, go youwith him.

331
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.500
Not I, my lord, unless I didbleed too.

332
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.770
I do beseech your majesty, makeup,

333
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.270
lest your retirement do amazeyour friends.

334
00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.270
I will do so.

335
00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.170
My Lord of Westmoreland, go youwith him.

336
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.870
Come, come, my lord; I'll leadyou to your tent.

337
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:02.900
Lead me, my lord?

338
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.300
I do not need your help.

339
00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.130
And God forbid a shallow scratchshould drive the Prince of Wales

340
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.000
from such a field as this,

341
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.270
where stain'd nobility liestrodden on

342
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.230
and rebels' arms triumph inmassacres.

343
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.270
We breathe too long.

344
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.730
Come, cousin Westmoreland.

345
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:16.930
Our duty this way lies.

346
00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.130
For God's sake, come.

347
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.630
By God, thou hast deceived me,Lancaster.

348
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.770
I did not think thee lord ofsuch a spirit.

349
00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.830
Before, I loved thee as abrother, John.

350
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.270
Now I do respect thee as mysoul.

351
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.670
I saw him hold Lord Percy at thepoint

352
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.030
with lustier maintenance than Idid look for

353
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.600
of such an ungrown warrior.

354
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.600
Oh, this boy lends mettle to usall.

355
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.570
Another king.

356
00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:48.970
They grow like Hydra's heads.

357
00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.300
I am the Douglas, fatal to allthose

358
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.930
that wear those colors on them.

359
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:56.130
Who art thou that counterfeit'stthe person of a king?

360
00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:59.970
The king himself, who, Douglas,

361
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.100
grieves at heart so many of hisshadows

362
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.000
thou hast met and not the veryking.

363
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.200
I have two boys seek Percy andthyself about the field.

364
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.330
But, seeing thou fall'st on meso luckily,

365
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.770
I will assay thee, so defendthyself.

366
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.300
I fear thou art anothercounterfeit.

367
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.230
Yet thou bear'st thee like aking.

368
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:41.170
But mine thou art, whoe'er thoube,

369
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.830
and thus I win thee.

370
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.330
Hold up thy head, vile Scot,

371
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.170
or thou art like never to holdit up again,

372
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.270
The spirits of valiant Shirley,Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms.

373
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.300
It is the Prince of Wales thatthreatens thee,

374
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.300
who never promiseth but he meansto pay.

375
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.500
Cheerly, my lord, how fares yourgrace?

376
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.230
Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath forsuccor sent,

377
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:04.300
and so hath Clifton.

378
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.500
I'll to Clifton straight.

379
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.800
Stay, and breathe awhile.

380
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.430
Thou hast redeem'd thy lostopinion

381
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.630
and show'd thou makest sometender of my life

382
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.030
in this fair rescue thou hastbrought to me.

383
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.200
O God!

384
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.430
They did me too much injury

385
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.300
that ever said I hearken'd foryour death.

386
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.870
If it were so, I might have letalone

387
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.630
the insulting hand of Douglasover you,

388
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:25.470
which would have been as speedyin your end

389
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.330
as all the poisonous potions inthe world

390
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.570
and saved the treacherous laborof your son!

391
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:31.770
Make up to Clifton.

392
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.100
I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.

393
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:45.000
If I mistake not, thou art HarryMonmouth.

394
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.800
Thou speak'st as if I would denymy name.

395
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:52.170
My name is Harry Percy.

396
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.730
Why, then I see a very valiantrebel of the name.

397
00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.330
I am the Prince of Wales, andthink not, Percy,

398
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.630
to share with me in glory anymore.

399
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.430
Two stars keep not their motionin one sphere,

400
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.630
nor can one England brook adouble reign

401
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.630
of Harry Percy and the Prince ofWales.

402
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.030
Nor shall it, Harry,

403
00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.270
for the hour is come to end theone of us.

404
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.700
And would to God thy name inarms were now

405
00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.970
as great as mine.

406
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.170
I'll make it greater ere I partfrom thee,

407
00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:22.900
and all the budding honors onthy crest I'll crop

408
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.370
to make a garland for my head.

409
00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:28.300
I can no longer brook thyvanities.

410
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.900
Oh!

411
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.000
Well said, Hal!

412
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.370
To it, Hal!

413
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.100
Nay, you shall find no boy'splay here,

414
00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.100
I can tell you.

415
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:30.570
Oh, Harry, thou hast robb'd meof my youth.

416
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.470
I better brook the loss ofbrittle life

417
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.730
than those proud titles thouhast won of me.

418
00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:42.070
They wound my thoughts worsethan thy sword my flesh.

419
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:48.270
But thoughts the slaves of life,and life time's fool.

420
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.630
And time itself, that takessurvey of all the world,

421
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.630
must have a stop.

422
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:05.470
Oh, I could prophesy,

423
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:09.530
but that the earthy and co--

424
00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:14.000
cold hand of death lies on mytongue.

425
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.400
No, Percy, thou art dust andfood for--

426
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.670
For worms, brave Percy.

427
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.330
Fare thee well, great heart.

428
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.230
Ill-weaved ambition, how muchart thou shrunk.

429
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:58.230
When that this body did containa spirit,

430
00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.430
a kingdom for it was too small abound.

431
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:05.000
But now two paces of the vilestearth

432
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.630
is room enough.

433
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:12.070
This earth that bears thee dead

434
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:14.230
bears not alive so stout agentleman.

435
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.200
If thou wert sensible ofcourtesy,

436
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.400
I should not make so dear a showof zeal.

437
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.830
But let my favors hide thymangled face.

438
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.130
And, even in thy behalf, I'llthank myself

439
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:40.170
for doing these fair rites oftenderness.

440
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:49.170
Adieu, and take thy praise withthee to heaven.

441
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:55.200
Thy ignominy sleep with thee inthe grave

442
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.570
but not remember'd in thyepitaph.

443
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:14.100
What, old acquaintance?

444
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:25.570
Could not all this flesh keep ina little life?

445
00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:29.900
Poor Jack, farewell.

446
00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:35.700
I could have better spared abetter man.

447
00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.530
Oh, I should have a heavy missof thee

448
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:40.730
if I were much in love withvanity.

449
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:44.530
Death hath not struck so fat adeer today,

450
00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:49.000
though many dearer, in thisbloody fray.

451
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.570
Embowell'd will I see thee byand by.

452
00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:01.470
Till then, in blood by noblePercy lie.

453
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.470
Embowelled?

454
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.100
If thou embowel me to-day,

455
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.330
I'll give you leave to powder meand eat me too tomorrow.

456
00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:18.070
'Sblood, twas time tocounterfeit,

457
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:21.000
or that hot termagant Scot hadpaid me scot and lot too.

458
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.870
Counterfeit?

459
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.570
I lie; I am no counterfeit.

460
00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.330
To die is to be a counterfeit,

461
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:27.970
for he is but the counterfeit ofa man

462
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.600
who hath not the life of a man.

463
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.570
But to counterfeit dying when aman thereby liveth

464
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:33.870
is to be no counterfeit

465
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:37.670
but the true and perfect imageof life indeed.

466
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.670
The better part of valor isdiscretion,

467
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:43.700
in the which better part I havesaved my life.

468
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.470
'Zounds, I'm afraid of thisgunpowder Percy,

469
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:04.900
though he be dead.

470
00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.870
How, if he should counterfeittoo and rise?

471
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:09.500
By my faith, I'm afraid

472
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.630
he'd prove the bettercounterfeit.

473
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.970
Therefore I'll make him sure.

474
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.930
Yea, and I'll swear I killedhim.

475
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.970
Why may not he rise as well asI?

476
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.630
Nothing confutes me but eyes,and nobody sees me.

477
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:24.730
Therefore, sirrah...

478
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.630
with a new wound in your thigh,come you along with me.

479
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:39.100
Come, brother John.

480
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.600
Full bravely hast thou flesh'dthy maiden sword.

481
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.600
But soft.

482
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.770
Whom have we here?

483
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.300
Did you not tell me this fat manwas dead?

484
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.300
I did.

485
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.430
I saw him dead.

486
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:51.970
Breathless and bleeding on theground.

487
00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.870
Art thou alive?

488
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.100
Or is it some fantasy that playsupon our eyesight?

489
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.330
I prithee, speak.

490
00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.870
We will not trust our eyeswithout our ears.

491
00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:01.970
Thou art not what thou seem'st.

492
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:03.470
No, that's certain.

493
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:05.870
I am no double man.

494
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:08.630
But if I be not Jack Falstaff,then am I a Jack.

495
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.300
There is Percy.

496
00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.300
If your father will do me anyhonor, so.

497
00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.000
If not, let him kill the nextPercy himself.

498
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.200
I look to be either earl orduke,

499
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.430
I can assure you.

500
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:23.330
Percy I killed myself and sawthee dead.

501
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:24.570
Didst thou?

502
00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:27.230
Lord, Lord, how this world isgiven to lying.

503
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.200
I grant, I was down and out ofbreath,

504
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.270
and so was he.

505
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.170
But we rose both at an instant

506
00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:35.200
and fought a long hour byShrewsbury clock.

507
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.630
If I may be believed, so.

508
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:39.900
If not, let them that shouldreward valor

509
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.400
take the sin upon their ownheads.

510
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.570
I'll take it upon my death,

511
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.270
I gave him this wound in thethigh.

512
00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.870
If the man were alive and woulddeny it,

513
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:49.530
'zounds, I'd make him eat apiece of my sword.

514
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:52.530
This is the strangest tale thatever I heard.

515
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.900
It is the strangest fellow,brother John.

516
00:27:54.900 --> 00:28:00.130
Come; bring your luggage noblyon your back.

517
00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.800
If a lie may do thee grace,

518
00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.800
I'll gild it with the happiestterms I have.

519
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.370
The trumpet sounds retreat.

520
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:14.100
The day is ours.

521
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.800
Come, brother; let us to thehighest of the field

522
00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.730
to see what friends are living,who are dead.

523
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:24.200
I'll follow, as they say, forreward.

524
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.030
He that rewards me, God rewardhim.

525
00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:32.170
If I do grow great, I'll growless,

526
00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:34.870
for I'll purge and leave sack

527
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:38.500
and live cleanly as a noblemanshould do.

528
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:47.030
Thus ever did rebellion findrebuke.

529
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.930
Ill-spirited Worcester.

530
00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:55.700
Did not we send grace, pardon,and terms of love to all of you?

531
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.500
And wouldst thou turn our offerscontrary,

532
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.330
misuse the tenor of thykinsman's trust?

533
00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.270
Three knights upon our partyslain today,

534
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.700
a noble earl and many a creatureelse

535
00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.870
had been alive this hour if,like a Christian,

536
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.500
thou hadst truly borne betwixtour armies

537
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.830
true intelligence.
