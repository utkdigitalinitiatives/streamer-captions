00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000



00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.030

        [MUSIC PLAYING]


00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.800

        It's the most fundamental
        act of human life.
      

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.990

        And though we may have come
        a long way from our early
      

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.670

        ancestors, one thing hasn't
        changed much.
      

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.620

        Sex.


00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.840

        Yet despite being widely
        practiced, sex has always been
      

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.430

        a bit of a mystery.


00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.060

        But science is starting to
        unlock its secrets, literally
      

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.760

        getting under our skin to reveal
        a new, bizarre world.
      

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.350



00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.780

        A world where the truly
        unexpected can happen.
      

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.960



00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.870

        For the first time on
        television, we follow a woman
      

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.090

        under the influence of hormones,
        acquiring the body,
      

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.080

        the mind, and facial
        hair of a man.
      

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.240



00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.070

        Understanding sex is the
        key to understanding
      

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.610

        how to build a human.


00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:47.750



00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.260

        All humans are built in bits far
        too small to be seen with
      

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.590

        the naked eye.


00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.840

        We're made up of cells.


00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.670



00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.410

        And inside every cell is exactly
        the same mix of genes.
      

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.660

        Our DNA.


00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.870



00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.520

        Until recently, reproduction
        was regarded as pretty
      

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.150

        straightforward.


00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.630

        To build a new human, you first
        take the genes that make
      

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.100

        up a woman, then the genes that
        make up a man, and then
      

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.100

        enthusiastically mix them up.


00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.730

        But things aren't quite
        that simple.
      

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.590

        We might have been doing it
        since the dawn of time, but
      

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.080

        scientists know very little
        about the basic processes.
      

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:38.410



00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.040

        Reproductive physiologist Dr.
        Roy Levin has struggled with
      

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.020

        the technical limitations of
        studying sex for decades.
      

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.640

        We didn't really have the
        apparatus to allow us to do
      

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.210

        the measurements.


00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.810

        And there was a long period of
        time when you only could guess
      

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.680

        what was happening from the
        external appearances of the
      

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.230

        men and women in coitus.


00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.750

        So that you couldn't really
        tell what was happening
      

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.700

        inside, because you
        just can't see.
      

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.640

        Our understanding of sex hasn't
        moved on much since
      

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.770

        Leonardo da Vinci first started
        dissecting corpses and
      

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.290

        studying them over
        500 years ago.
      

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.930

        The Queen holds this drawing
        by Leonardo in her very own
      

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.180

        private collection.


00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.690



00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.740

        Dr. Levin's life long quest to
        reveal the secrets of sex is
      

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.560

        taking him to Germany.


00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.280

        What I've come for
        is a machine.
      

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.980

        This is a machine that makes
        the body transparent.
      

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.920

        You can look inside and see
        movements and the secrets,
      

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.880

        really, of coitus and how people
        get sexually aroused.
      

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.830

        There are very few machines like
        this in the world, and
      

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.150

        one of them is here in the town
        called Krefeld, quite a
      

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.390

        few miles outside
        of Dusseldorf.
      

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.180

        And the machine Dr. Levin's
        come to see
      

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.020

        is this fMRI scanner.


00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.280

        It's basically a camera which
        uses magnetic fields to
      

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.560

        penetrate human flesh.


00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.400

        Today, in the interest of
        science, Michael DeGroot and
      

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.040

        his girlfriend Liz Leahy are
        going to attempt to have sex
      

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.340

        in its cramped confines.


00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.330

        Well, this is the machine.


00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.680

        As you can see inside, it's
        got, like, two donuts.
      

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.990

        Those are the very
        large magnets.
      

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.210

        And in between is the space
        that you'll lie
      

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.910

        down and have coitus.


00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.090

        It's been specially adapted,
        that means just a single board
      

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.060

        has been put down.


00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.990

        And you'll lay in between
        the two magnets.
      

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.450

        And hopefully that will capture
        the images of what's
      

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.510

        going on during sexual
        intercourse.
      

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.890

        The other thing that has to
        happen is, Liz, is that you
      

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.380

        have to wear this girdle.


00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.350

        It won't do much for your
        figure, but it will hopefully
      

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.160

        capture the images from what's
        happening inside your body.
      

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.530

        So you have to put around you,
        in the pelvic area, and then
      

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.970

        you lay on top of that.


00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.560

        And so that's really basically
        all there is to it.
      

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.070

        The other thing is, though,
        Michael, that will help you to
      

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.790

        perform with this pharmaceutical
        support for it.
      

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.270

        So hopefully it will help
        you to do this.
      

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.510

        Let's go and get changed, OK?


00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.390

        Dr. Levin is well aware of the
        problems that need to be
      

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.800

        overcome if this experiment
        is to be successful.
      

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.470

        It's not the easiest thing in
        the world to maintain an
      

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.740

        erection and have intercourse
        in terms of this
      

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.580

        particular set up.


00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.860

        They're brave people that
        go into these machines.
      

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.460

        We've seen the machine and I'm
        interested to see how we're
      

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.420

        going to maneuver ourselves in
        there, because it looks like a
      

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.340

        pretty constricted space.


00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.010

        And I know they want us in
        one certain position.
      

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.910

        I hope that we're able to
        situate ourselves so that they
      

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.710

        get the images that they want.


00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.300

        That's my main concern.


00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.980

        Michael has a personal interest
        in taking part in
      

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.540

        this study.


00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.880

        I have a small background in
        human sexuality in the
      

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.560

        psychology aspect, because I'm
        a psychology undergraduate.
      

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.430

        With my background, I just got
        an interest in hearing about
      

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.840

        these images that would be one
        of the first times that these
      

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.680

        would ever be recorded.


00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.600

        I just thought it would
        be really fun to be a
      

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.850

        part of this work.


00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.680



00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.290

        OK.


00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.040

        We're ready to go, you
        can start now.
      

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:11.460



00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.430

        The scanner takes a picture
        every three seconds, and
      

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.660

        produces images of the body
        from top to bottom.
      

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.880

        This is the first time that such
        images have been seen on
      

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.570

        British television.


00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.600

        You can see the penis here.


00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.640

        That's outside of the body from
        about here and this is
      

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.480

        the root of the penis
        inside the body.
      

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.470

        And this is inside the
        female's body.
      

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.870

        That's her pubic symphysis, the
        bone, and here would be
      

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.140

        the pubic hair, just
        around here.
      

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.650

        And that's, of course,
        a bottom.
      

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.680

        And this is the vagina
        that the penis is in.
      

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.520

        The top here is the gland.


00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.140

        And the thing that's obvious in
        this cross section is the
      

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.180

        unusual shape of the penis
        during intercourse.
      

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.210

        It's like a boomerang.


00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.440

        That's what we found out by
        these machines, actually.
      

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.640

        That, in fact, the penis does
        look like a boomerang.
      

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.850

        It isn't straight like they drew
        it in the early times.
      

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.150

        In fact, it is bent, as you
        can see, quite clearly.
      

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.740

        It's actually incredible
        because, as far as when you
      

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.160

        have an erection, you think it's
        hard and solid as a rock
      

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.260

        or wood or something.


00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.840

        But when you look at those
        pictures, it's unbelievable.
      

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.600

        You have the 90 degree angle,
        you can't even imagine that it
      

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.730

        would bend that way.


00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:19.480

        It's really fascinating
        to see--
      

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.710

        It's just incredible.


00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:21.750

        -- what the body does.


00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.410

        It's not something you really
        think about when you're
      

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.190

        actually in an act like that.


00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.110

        And to actually have the
        pictures to see what's going
      

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.070

        on, it's just extremely
        interesting.
      

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.770

        Nobody knows why the penis
        has to go through such
      

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.120

        extraordinary contortions.


00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.460

        One theory is that it's a relic
        from our past, when sex
      

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.260

        was more commonly done on all
        fours, and not face to face.
      

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.020



00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.120

        Dr. Levin is aware these
        experiments might be seen as
      

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.710

        prurient or trivial.


00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.970

        But he believes that
        understanding the mechanics
      

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.590

        has important practical
        applications.
      

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.310

        One possibility is that when
        we get a bank of normal
      

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.180

        images, of functional, normal
        reproduction, and the
      

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.880

        movements that occur, and we
        have a whole range of images--
      

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.530

        because this is just one couple
        that we've done--
      

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.830

        we can then possibly look at
        people who are abnormal, that
      

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.120

        they can't have children.


00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.820

        And maybe the dysfunctions that
        are there might be in the
      

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.750

        movements, might be in the
        motility that we can pick up
      

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.690

        and then we'll be able to look
        at it, and possibly have
      

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:23.330

        treatments for it.


00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.910

        But that's really looking
        into the future.
      

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.330

        We're just starting out.


00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.880

        Really, the first
        step this is.
      

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.170

        Understanding anatomy is
        important if you really want
      

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:36.350

        to understand what makes
        men and women tick.
      

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.650

        But there's also much that
        can be learned by
      

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.700

        studying their cells.


00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.940

        Down at this level, men and
        women are all very similar.
      

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.110

        Each cell holds a nucleus,
        which, in turn, contains DNA,
      

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.470

        the substance that builds us.


00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:57.710

        Each cell contains over two
        meters of DNA, divided and
      

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.310

        packaged neatly into
        chromosomes.
      

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.550

        There are 46 of these.


00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:08.360

        The real difference between men
        and women is that women
      

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.300

        normally have two x
        sex chromosomes.
      

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:18.280

        While men have an x and a y.


00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.670

        But it's not always that
        straightforward.
      

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:24.060



00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.900

        Look at Jan Johnson, she's
        an athletic, feminine,
      

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.170

        42-year-old woman.


00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.330

        She's also a six foot three
        inches tall, a distinct
      

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.810

        advantage when you are
        playing volleyball.
      

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.350

        The other thing that's different
        about Jen is that
      

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.570

        she's genetically male.


00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.470

        There's a huge stigma attached
        to my condition.
      

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.930

        I think a lot of people don't
        want to talk about their
      

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.540

        personal conditions, and, you
        know, no one's perfect.
      

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:58.290

        Lots of people have problems.
        And it's just a matter of
      

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.270

        facing your deepest darkest
        secrets in and bringing them
      

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.810

        out in the open.


00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.580

        She had no idea that there was
        anything strange about her
      

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.910

        when she was growing up.


00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:15.660

        The only thing that I remember
        is that I was just very active
      

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.520

        and I just had a
        lot of energy.
      

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.820

        In terms of feeling different,
        no, I didn't.
      

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:26.040

        I just felt like a normal
        little girl.
      

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.960

        I had girlfriends and I had all
        my dolls and everything
      

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.490

        was just normal.


00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.490

        It wasn't until she went to
        college to study anatomy that
      

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.890

        she realized something
        was wrong.
      

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:43.050

        Quite simply, at the age of
        nineteen, she still hadn't
      

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:43.950

        gone through puberty.


00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.400

        I felt self-conscious, because
        I wasn't developing like all
      

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.990

        my girlfriends were
        developing.
      

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.470

        It's painful to stand up and be
        different, and I wanted to
      

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.120

        find out why I wasn't
        starting my period.
      

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.240

        So I ended up going to
        the gynecologist
      

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.350

        for the first time.


00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.320

        I came into class one
        day very upset and--
      

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.130

        because I had gone to the doctor
        a few days before.
      

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.530

        And they had very simply just
        written x, y on a piece of
      

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.450

        paper and gave that to me.


00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.770

        And that was supposed to be the
        explanation of why I was
      

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.100

        the way I was.


00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.060

        So why did Jan become a
        woman, when her genes
      

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.360

        were those of a man?


00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.110

        The answer lies in understanding
        how the male sex
      

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.480

        chromosome, the y chromosome,
        works.
      

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.520



00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.240

        The most obvious thing
        about the y is that
      

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.580

        it isn't very big.


00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.720

        The y has around 60 genes,
        and the x around 3,000.
      

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.710

        The y chromosome is the
        smallest chromosome.
      

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.160

        And when you look at it in
        detail, only a very small part
      

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.680

        of it actually codes
        for anything.
      

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.830

        So most of it's a dessert.


00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:55.030

        Peter Goodfellow knows the
        y chromosome intimately.
      

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.690

        He found the gene responsible
        for turning embryos into men.
      

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.240



00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.330

        It's on the y chromosome,
        and it's called the SRY.
      

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.420

        It's hugely influential
        in how men develop.
      

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.170

        And this is it.


00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.120

        But being very important
        doesn't mean it's big.
      

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.170

        Imagine that your DNA was
        a piece of string, so
      

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:22.340

        you could see it.


00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.970

        So we've magnified the DNA,
        which is present in every cell
      

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:28.590

        in your body, so it's visible.


00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.140



00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.720

        And that piece of string
        now would stretch
      

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.300

        from here to Moscow.


00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.190

        Now if we were to start a
        journey from here to Moscow on
      

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:47.330

        foot, the y chromosome would
        represent the first 20 miles
      

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.480

        of that journey.


00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.940

        And the SRY gene would
        be the first step on
      

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.240

        the journey to Moscow.


00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.870

        It takes 30,000 genes
        to build a human.
      

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:05.550

        But just one gene, the
        SRY, to build a man.
      

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.750

        The SRY is a switch, which
        clicks on when the fetus is
      

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.470

        around six weeks old.


00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.730

        Until then, the baby could
        become either male or female.
      

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.530

        When the SRY is switched on, it
        fires up the development of
      

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:19.930

        the male sex organs.


00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.870

        There's a tiny genetic
        difference.
      

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.690

        That genetic difference leads
        to one key difference, and
      

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:30.860

        that one key difference
        is men have testes
      

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.630

        and women have ovaries.


00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.760

        And it's what produced by the
        testes, and what's produced by
      

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.020

        the ovaries, which is
        responsible for the
      

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.750

        differences you see between
        males and females.
      

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:47.940

        But Jan Johnson has a copy
        of the SRY gene, so
      

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.290

        why isn't she a man?


00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:55.150

        Well, the SRY triggers
        development of the testes.
      

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:59.510

        And they produce a versatility
        hormone called testosterone.
      

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:03.190

        Testosterone is a steroid
        hormone and, one of the things
      

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.000

        that steroid hormones are
        excellent at is going in lots
      

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.920

        of different places in the body
        and instigating lots of
      

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.740

        different changes.


00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.630

        And testosterone is a beautiful
        example of that.
      

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.770

        Testosterone rampages through
        the male embryo, building
      

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:21.970

        muscle and developing the
        cardiovascular system.
      

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.780

        It's this hormone which
        makes men so very
      

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.000

        different from women.


00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.600

        To a remarkable extent,
        testosterone is responsible
      

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.390

        for the masculinization
        of the human body.
      

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.230

        It's really--


00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:34.720

        in some ways, it's kind of
        surprising that this one agent
      

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.140

        seems to start this cascade
        that has so
      

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.390

        many different affects.


00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.500



00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.510

        And it's testosterone this is
        the answer to the riddle of
      

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.830

        Jan Johnson's unusual
        genetic makeup.
      

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.640



00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.080

        Jan has a condition called
        AIS, androgen
      

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.970

        insensitivity syndrome.


00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.850

        Her genes make testosterone,
        but her body
      

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.180

        can't respond to it.


00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.840

        If it can't react to
        testosterone, the fetus
      

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.710

        assumes the default position,
        which is female.
      

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.990

        And that's exactly what happened
        to Jan Johnson.
      

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.510

        The discovery that she's
        genetically male was so
      

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:20.980

        traumatizing that she couldn't
        even tell her then boyfriend
      

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.940

        and, future husband, Peter.


00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.390

        I told him, well, I'm unable
        to have children, and, you
      

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:30.700

        know, here's my situation,
        I don't have my period.
      

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.700

        But I never really got
        into the nuts and
      

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.100

        bolts of it with him.


00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:40.520

        Because it was embarrassing
        for me.
      

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.080

        I didn't want to
        talk about it.
      

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.060

        And I didn't think anyone
        wanted to hear about it.
      

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.880



00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.910

        The only person she felt would
        listen and understand was her
      

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.300

        anatomy professor,
        Kris Blodget.
      

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:58.010

        I said, that's well, the first
        thing I want to know is,
      

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.620

        you're a normal girl.


00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.980

        You're not a boy, you're
        definitely a girl, you're a
      

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.700

        very feminine girl.


00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.680

        This should not change
        your life.
      

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.050

        It was devastating to know that
        I had x y chromosomes,
      

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.440

        and those are the same
        chromosomes a man would have.
      

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.720

        Then I said, well, you can't
        respond to testosterone so
      

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:22.720

        actually you are more feminine
        than an actual, x, x female
      

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.460

        who can respond to
        testosterone too.
      

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:32.380

        So I said, the people that
        have this, develop this,
      

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.810

        normal females, usually above
        average in attractiveness.
      

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.970

        They're tall, they're
        very feminine.
      

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:45.570

        Professor Blodget then got Jan
        to check her our own genes, so
      

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.520

        she could see there was nothing
        to be frightened of.
      

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.610

        She was probably the strongest
        female person in
      

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.480

        my life back then.


00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.870

        My mom couldn't really
        offer any support.
      

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.410

        And, you know, my siblings
        certainly
      

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:02.750

        couldn't offer support.


00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:07.060

        So I really didn't have anyone
        who could explain it to me the
      

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.680

        way she explained it to me.


00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.340

        And the pain and the hurt to
        the discovery that she was
      

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:16.640

        genetically male came flooding
        back when they met for the
      

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:38.820

        first time since Jan left
        college, 25 years ago.
      

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.370

        I was hoping that she'd put it
        behind her, and was leading a
      

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.770

        normal life, and
        not considering
      

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.070

        it a deep dark secret.


00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:49.230

        And realize that she is totally
        feminine and normal.
      

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.740

        She really made me feel a lot
        better about myself, so it was
      

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.990

        great to see her again.


00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:58.290



00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:02.590

        Jan's unusual genetic makeup
        means she can't have children,
      

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:06.940

        the things she wants most. She
        doesn't have a womb, or
      

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.900

        ovaries, and that's
        put an inevitable
      

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.150

        strain on her marriage.


00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.770



00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.490

        We've been together for 23
        years, we've been married for
      

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.470

        13 years and we certainly
        had our ups and downs.
      

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:28.050

        And some of the deepest lows
        were over, you know, adoption.
      

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:32.220

        And that's unfortunate.


00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.890

        I hoped back then that I would
        meet someone that would want
      

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:36.460

        to adopt children.


00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.980

        And it just didn't work out.


00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.710

        It was not the right time.


00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:45.590

        And we didn't have
        the money, or--
      

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.720

        for some reason or another
        it just never worked out.
      

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.050



00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.110

        Ironically, Jan Johnson works
        for a company which makes high
      

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:56.360

        tech medical equipment.


00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.020



00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.710

        But there's no technological
        solution to her
      

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:02.960

        inability to conceive.


00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.240



00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.630

        She just doesn't have
        the right genes.
      

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:14.130

        Instead of a y, she'd
        need another x.
      

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.670

        That's because the second
        x sends out
      

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.560

        instructions to make ovaries.


00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.490

        These produced the female
        hormone, estrogen, which
      

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:26.500

        builds a womb and
        fallopian tubes.
      

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.340



00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.830

        The discovery that men are
        created from a female
      

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.400

        blueprint was certainly a big
        surprise, and contradicts
      

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.440

        previously held notions
        about the relative
      

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.790

        importance of men and women.


00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:45.200

        Societies have decided the
        relative importance of men and
      

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.260

        women for thousands of years.


00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.400

        By and large, the men are
        regarded as more important
      

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.550

        than the women.


00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.970

        So when biology started to catch
        up, at first they looked
      

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:55.820

        to reinforce that.


00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.040

        The idea was that the sperm
        contend the little person and
      

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:04.110

        the woman was just the soil in
        which the man would grow, they
      

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:05.100

        baby would grow.


00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.300

        Gradually, as we've learned more
        about it, we've realized
      

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.910

        that the mum is rather more
        important, that the woman's
      

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.030

        rather more important.


00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:15.860

        And the big shock came when it
        was realized that if you don't
      

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.610

        have a sex chromosome, or one
        of the sex chromosomes, you
      

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:20.700

        don't come out as a boy.


00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.950

        You come out as a girl.


00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:25.530

        So what that tells us is that
        the Bible was fundamentally
      

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.250

        the wrong way around.


00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.980

        Woman was not born of
        man's rib, it's
      

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:30.960

        the other way around.


00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.080

        Adam, if anything, came
        from Eve's rib.
      

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.770

        So the male is an adapted
        form of the female.
      

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.400



00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.200

        One very obvious remnant of our
        female past can be found
      

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:48.460

        on every male chest. Nipples.


00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.470

        The reason men have nipples is
        because they developed in the
      

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:55.370

        fetus before testosterone
        kicked in.
      

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:58.690

        But if a hit of testosterone
        is all it takes to turn the
      

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:06.820

        female form into the male, what
        would happen if a genetic
      

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.190

        female were to be
        exposed to it?
      

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.470

        Max Toth, a software programmer,
        is physically and
      

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.430

        genetically a woman.


00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.550

        She wants to see if
        testosterone can
      

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.820

        turn her into a man.


00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.350

        I remembered having this
        distinct moment where I
      

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.960

        thought that God had made a
        mistake and that I should have
      

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.520

        been a boy.


00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.200

        Which I thought was interesting
        because I grew up
      

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.590

        in an atheist household.


00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.340

        I didn't really have a good
        conception of what God was, or
      

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.790

        that there was an entity that
        could have made a mistake.
      

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.310

        But I remembered having this
        very clear moment.
      

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:43.650



00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.340

        Science can't explain why she
        feels like this, but she knows
      

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.660

        she's not right the
        way she is.
      

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.880

        She wants the body and
        looks of a man.
      

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.450

        The idea that I could do this,
        that I could change something
      

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:57.910

        about the way that
        I was made up.
      

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.740

        That it could change the way
        that my body had been born was
      

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:02.990

        very exciting to me.


00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.770



00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:10.790

        To masculinize her body, Max is
        planning to take a close of
      

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.350

        testosterone.


00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.960

        I'm taking my life into my own
        hands in a lot of ways,
      

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.220

        because there aren't a lot of
        studies about the long term
      

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.470

        effects of testosterone.


00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:21.080



00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.480

        But Max really wanted
        to do it, and
      

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.460

        have it properly evaluated.


00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.140

        So we followed her testosterone
        treatment for six
      

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.640

        months, to see what effect it
        would have, not only on her
      

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.700

        body, but also on her mind.


00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.090

        Three, two, one.


00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:42.530

        The body changes will
        be the most obvious.
      

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:45.410

        Testosterone should build her
        muscles and make her more
      

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:49.040

        powerful, which should mean
        that she'll run faster.
      

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.040



00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.750

        To test this effect, we set up
        a round course of just over a
      

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.770

        mile in Panhandle Park, in the
        middle of San Francisco, and
      

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.190

        recorded her time.


00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:08.560

        11 minutes exactly.


00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.030

        We'll come back and check that
        time as we monitor the
      

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.450

        progress of her testosterone
        treatment.
      

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.380



00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.560

        Apart from the rather obvious
        physical effects, testosterone
      

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.440

        might also change the
        way her brain works.
      

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.180

        So we had her brain scanned by
        Dr. Rubin Gur, one of the
      

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.360

        world's leading scientists
        on the effects of
      

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.970

        hormones on the brain.


00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.220

        Go.


00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:36.830



00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:40.000

        Dr. Gur also put Max through
        a battery of practical and
      

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.660

        psychological tests, designed
        to see just how feminine Max
      

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.910

        currently is.


00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:49.290



00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:50.770

        Stop.


00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:58.160

        Max shows a fairly typical
        female profile, cognitively.
      

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.060

        And I'd be curious to
        see whether there
      

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:06.140

        is a change in that.


00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.880

        At the moment, by any, measure
        Max is a woman.
      

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.670



00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.200

        But that's about to change.


00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.100



00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.680

        I had a birthday
        party recently.
      

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.130

        And I thought as part of the
        festivities that I would allow
      

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:23.900

        people to express themselves
        artistically by drying my
      

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.020

        future facial hair.


00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:30.550

        So I gave people this form and
        this is some of the stuff they
      

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:31.370

        came up with.


00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:33.580

        Trucker Max.


00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.910

        Flaming Max.


00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:38.280

        Spit curls.


00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.990

        Bad 80s rock star.


00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.140

        Funky shimmer boy.


00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:48.050

        My absolute favorite, the I'm
        secure in my masculinity Max.
      

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.100



00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:54.110

        Today's the day when Max
        receives her first shot of
      

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:55.360

        testosterone.


00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.350



00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:59.600

        Hey, Max, come on in.


00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.020



00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:06.950

        From now on, she wants to
        be referred to as he.
      

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.720

        So this is the big day, huh?


00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.400

        I'm starting you on a
        really small dose.
      

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.050

        It's a very small volume,
        so it's not a problem.
      

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:16.450

        I actually still have to go draw
        it up, I just wanted to
      

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:19.450

        check what dose that we're
        starting you on.
      

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:23.020

        Max will soon be exposed to the
        same level of testosterone
      

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.890

        as a young boy going
        through puberty.
      

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:25.970

        Okee-doke.


00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.490

        Here we go.


00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:29.360

        There you go.


00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:29.840

        On three.


00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.750

        One, two, three.


00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.620



00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.010

        There you go, that's it.


00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.580

        Yay.


00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.960

        Put an band-aid on there.


00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.530



00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:44.470

        Thank you.


00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:45.400

        You're very welcome.


00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.540

        It was kind of exciting, and
        it was kind of scary.
      

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.880

        And my arm hurt.


00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.640

        Ow.


00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.570

        I'm rolling the dice and
        seeing what it is
      

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.010

        that's going to happen.


00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:59.810

        And I have my own personal
        beliefs about how much one's
      

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.270

        personality shifts aren't
        biochemical.
      

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:05.880

        I'm kind of in the camp of, I
        think that a lot of stuff is
      

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.740

        sociological, and I'm willing
        to stake my life on it.
      

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:13.020

        And the better part of
        my biochemistry.
      

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.440

        We're going to see, at
        the end of this.
      

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.150

        I don't want to wake up and
        be knuckle-dragging and
      

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.330

        chest-thumping and
        things like that.
      

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.970

        It does make me nervous, but
        I don't think I will.
      

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:27.110

        Women naturally have some
        testosterone in their bodies.
      

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:30.080

        But men have 10 times as much.


00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.750

        And some have more
        than others.
      

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.660

        But does it really matter
        what your level is?
      

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.950



00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:41.460

        Take a look at these athletes.


00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.310

        They're all highly trained 100
        meter specialists, and about
      

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.480

        the same age.


00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.610

        But if they raced, could you
        tell, just by looking
      

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:50.860

        at them who'd win?


00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:55.840



00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.650

        Well, this man, Dr. John Manning
        says he can, just by
      

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:01.770

        measuring their fingers.


00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:04.200

        And that's because testosterone
        levels and finger
      

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.100

        lengths are intimately linked.


00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.280

        We've known for a long time that
        there's a sex difference
      

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.010

        in the fingers.


00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.020

        That it's quite a subtle
        difference and, in general,
      

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:18.580

        people don't talk about and
        don't know about it even.
      

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.310

        It starts in the womb.


00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:24.360

        Hormones rush through the
        developing embryo, building
      

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.060

        and shaping the body, including
        the fingers.
      

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:31.310

        And the effects can be
        seen years later.
      

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:34.650

        Compare the hand of the man on
        the left, with that of the
      

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.880

        woman on the right.


00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.360

        The man's ring finger is longer
        than his index finger.
      

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.560

        In the case of the woman,
        it's the opposite.
      

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:48.710

        The index finger is longer
        than the ring finger.
      

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:52.710

        We think that the length of the
        ring finger is a direct
      

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:55.270

        indicator of the amount
        of testosterone one's
      

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.140

        exposed to in utero.


00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.370

        And the length of the index
        finger indicates the amount of
      

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:03.240

        estrogen you've been exposed
        to in utero.
      

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.370

        So it's the relative lengths
        of these two
      

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.300

        fingers that are important.


00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.530

        If you've got a longer ring
        finger than your index finger,
      

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:13.320

        you've been exposed to
        high testosterone.
      

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.520

        If you've got a longer index
        finger than ring finger,
      

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.740

        you've been exposed to low


00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.660

        testosterone and high estrogen.


00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.660

        Dr. Manning is one of the
        world's leading experts on
      

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.170

        testosterone.


00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.850

        In the course of his
        investigations, he's worked
      

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:31.070

        both with infertile
        men, and with
      

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.270

        professional football players.


00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:36.570

        He believes prenatal
        testosterone plays a big part
      

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:39.210

        in determining future athletic
        performance.
      

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.140

        OK, lads.


00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.760

        All I'm going to do is measure
        your fingers on your left hand
      

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:43.590

        and your right hand--


00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:46.250

        But he's never put his
        considerable reputation on the
      

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:49.250

        line by trying to predict the
        result of a race between
      

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:54.170

        athletes he's never
        met, or seen run.
      

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.190

        If I can have your right
        hand first. This
      

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.120

        is a high risk business.


00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.750

        It would be nice to have 10
        races, with 10 different
      

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:02.730

        groups of athletes.


00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:07.300

        And I think we would probably
        be able to predict eight out
      

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.840

        of the 10 winners of
        those 10 races.
      

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:15.750

        One race is highly chance-y,
        but I'll give it a go.
      

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.870

        So, why should it work?


00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:21.180

        Well, testosterone helps develop
        the heart and lungs.
      

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.310

        The engine of any athlete.


00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:27.130

        Crudely speaking, the bigger the
        hit of testosterone in the
      

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:31.630

        womb, the greater the physical
        potential of the fetus.
      

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.180

        It's obviously impossible to
        say with any certainty how
      

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.900

        much testosterone these men were
        exposed to when in their
      

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.490

        mother's wombs.


00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:41.950

        Instead, Dr. Manning is using
        their fingers as a guide to
      

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:45.410

        the size of their
        in utero hit.
      

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:49.890

        The runners and their coach
        aren't entirely convinced.
      

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.130

        Don't think it's
        going to work.
      

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.620

        Not confident at all about it.


00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.100

        We're all probably a bit
        skeptical about it.
      

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.510

        But it's got [? undue ?]


00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:59.070

        possibilities if there's
        something in it.
      

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:00.300

        I cannot see it.


00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.210

        Why your hand measurements
        would predict
      

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:03.890

        how fast you run.


00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:05.500

        Can't see any connection
        between the two.
      

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.940



00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.620

        While the lads get ready to run,
        Dr. Manning finds a quiet
      

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.940

        corner to make his
        calculations.
      

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:19.970



00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:22.760

        So has he found a winner?


00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.020

        These are fine, very,
        very fine young men.
      

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.580

        They are excellent athletes.


00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:30.270

        And they've all had quite high
        testosterone levels before
      

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.100

        birth, as one would expect.


00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.100

        But there are clear differences
        between them.
      

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.590

        As far as he's concerned, these
        are the winning fingers.
      

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:43.270

        They belong to Tim
        [? Abeyu ?].
      

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.070

        And you can see the difference
        between his ring finger and
      

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:49.970

        his index finger is
        quite marked.
      

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:53.020

        Compare his head to one
        of the other runners.
      

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.460

        This is Ian [? Deeth's ?]


00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:58.170

        hand, and the difference
        is obvious.
      

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:01.540

        Tim's got a still very low
        ratio and, I think, has
      

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.920

        tremendous potential.


00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.750

        I think he's a very,
        very fast runner.
      

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:07.810

        So I'd go for Tim.


00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:11.270

        As they prepare to race, none
        of the athletes know Dr.
      

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:13.250

        Manning's selection.


00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:16.990

        So, the moment of truth.


00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.570

        They line up from the left.


00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:19.310

        In lane one it's Lawrence
        [? Aubry ?].
      

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:22.590

        In lane two, it's Jonathan
        [? Beaches ?], three is Ian
      

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:25.770

        [? Deeth, ?] four James
        Ellington, and in five, Dr.
      

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:27.390

        Manning's selection,
        Tim [? Abeyu. ?]
      

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:36.050

        be


00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:38.740

        And Abeyu's got an absolute
        fly out, he
      

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.550

        storms out of the blocks.


00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:41.210

        C'mon, Tim.


00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:43.290

        Dr. Manning looks like he's
        picked a winner here, but
      

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:43.520

        [? Aubry ?]


00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.310

        in lane one is fighting back.


00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:46.580

        But the big man in lane five
        is pouring it on and
      

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.800

        [? Abeyu's ?] got too much
        and [? Abeyu ?] wins.
      

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.360



00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.500

        So the prediction was spot on.


00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.940

        Which was a huge relief
        for Dr. Manning.
      

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.750

        I was very, very pleased to see
        Tim go across that line
      

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:04.320

        first. And in great
        style as well.
      

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.090

        Be interested to know if they
        ever research on elite
      

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:11.230

        athletes, at the very top of
        their game, if the same
      

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:13.410

        principle applies.


00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:15.970

        Dr. Manning is conducting
        similar research with the
      

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.820

        British Ski Federation, helping
        to select potential
      

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.250

        downhill champions.


00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:24.290

        Men are engineered in such a way
        as to be able to compete
      

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:26.160

        physically against other men.


00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:30.400

        So the more testosterone a fetus
        has-- a male fetus has--
      

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.130

        the more efficient his
        cardiovascular system is going
      

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:34.330

        to be after birth.


00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:38.850

        If you don't get exposure early,
        and to high amounts of
      

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:43.490

        testosterone, then it will
        affect your physical
      

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:45.620

        competitive abilities
        later in life.
      

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.870



00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:52.880

        In the light of such findings,
        parents might be tempted to
      

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.040

        add a touch of testosterone to
        their growing fetuses, in the
      

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.850

        hope this will make them
        more athletic.
      

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:02.930

        But building super athletes by
        manipulating testosterone
      

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.080

        would be dangerous.


00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.290

        And, anyway, there's much more


00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:10.410

        sophisticated technology available.


00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:12.780

        You can definitely create super
        athletes in the future,
      

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:16.540

        and there's a much easier way to
        do that than to muck around
      

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.600

        with the embryo itself.


00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.410

        The better way to do this is
        to create the cassette of
      

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.550

        genes that you want
        in the laboratory.
      

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:26.970

        So even before you come near an
        embryo, in your laboratory
      

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:29.910

        you put together each of the
        genes that you want to put
      

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:31.030

        into your future child.


00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.130

        You put them together, you make
        sure that they're working
      

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:36.350

        properly, and you put them on
        to a brand new chromosome.
      

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.240

        And then you take this
        chromosome, which has already
      

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.960

        been vetted for perfection, you
        take this chromosome and
      

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.710

        put it into the embryo.


00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:46.930

        And that's a much more efficient
        way of changing a
      

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:47.890

        large number of genetic


00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:51.090

        characteristics at the same time.


00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:52.800

        If you think that sounds
        like science
      

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.240

        fiction, you'd be wrong.


00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.760



00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.940

        Artificial chromosomes are
        not just figments in the
      

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.910

        imagination of scientists, they
        have already been created
      

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:02.640

        in the laboratory.


00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.440

        They have already been placed
        into mouse embryos.
      

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.200

        We already have mice born with
        these extra chromosomes.
      

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.600

        And if you can do it in mice,
        you can do it in humans.
      

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:17.960



00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:23.720

        But doing it in humans would be
        big and disturbing advance.
      

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.610

        The differences, on a genetic
        level, between us and our
      

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:30.830

        early ancestors, like
        Australopithecus, are tiny.
      

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:32.080

        Less than 1%.


00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.210



00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:40.360

        If it only took a few tiny
        changes in our DNA to go from
      

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:44.280

        Australopithecus to us, imagine
        where implanting an
      

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.550

        array of artificial chromosomes
        might lead to.
      

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:56.550



00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:00.140

        But perhaps it will
        never happen.
      

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:03.760

        We've got to be aware that
        it' not easy to do.
      

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.920

        Even if you achieve it, you've
        then got to say, can
      

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.120

        I keep doing it?


00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.030

        We've been to the moon once, but
        there's no hotels there.
      

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:13.950

        So the ability to do it once is
        not the same as being able
      

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:15.940

        to do it on a wet Wednesday
        in Doncaster.
      

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:19.520

        And I have great concerns about
        the complexity of these
      

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.270

        techniques, and their
        applicability.
      

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:24.710

        Even for severe diseases.


00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:27.850

        But even if you got it to the
        stage where you could make it
      

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:31.000

        work, and you could cure some
        rare diseases, or some serious
      

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.940

        diseases, would you actually use
        that very precious, very
      

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:39.370

        expensive and challenging
        technology to do something as
      

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:43.890

        trivial as social modification
        of a person to make them
      

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.390

        bigger, smarter, or whatever.


00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:49.320

        Which island full of mad
        scientists is actually going
      

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.090

        to do that?


00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:52.520

        I don't think they exist. I
        don't think that would allow
      

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.130

        their precious reserves
        and resources to be
      

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:57.380

        used for that purpose.


00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:01.130



00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:04.590

        But expensive and challenging
        technology is being used all
      

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:09.020

        the time for purposes its
        makers did not intend.
      

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.160

        Testosterone wasn't
        synthesized to
      

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.660

        turn women into men.


00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:15.010

        Yet it's being used for that.


00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:20.900



00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.230

        It's six months since Max
        first started taking
      

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:26.010

        testosterone.


00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.260

        So, what are the changes?


00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.650



00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:33.560

        Well, he sings in a synagogue.


00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.580

        And his voice is certainly
        different.
      

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.920

        My voice is starting
        to get deeper.
      

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.560

        It fluctuates where--


00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.200

        depending on where I
        am with the dose--
      

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.960

        it can go farther down
        when I'm singing.
      

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.920

        But my speaking voice can be
        anywhere from exactly normal
      

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.250

        to slightly lower than normal.


00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:54.090



00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.510

        And he's also getting
        much hairier.
      

00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:00.860

        I'm getting more body hair in
        traditionally male patterns.
      

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.630

        Hair is coming in on the
        back of my calves.
      

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.290

        Hair's coming in on the edge
        of my hands in a way that
      

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.930

        never happened before.


00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:11.920

        I'm starting to get darker
        facial hair here, and a little
      

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.410

        bit more here.


00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:16.710

        Some on the sides, but
        it's really subtle.
      

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:19.130

        My whole body is changing
        slightly.
      

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:20.700

        My weight's redistributing.


00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.420

        My hips are getting smaller.


00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.540

        And my shoulders are starting
        to get more broad, and I am
      

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.410

        starting to get more
        shoulder muscles.
      

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:29.170

        Which, I have been working out
        a lot, so it's clearly not
      

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:31.090

        from what I've been doing.


00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:34.880

        Five, four, three, two, one.


00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.600



00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.660

        And those physical changes
        are having an
      

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:43.050

        impact on his running.


00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:47.410

        He's a full minute faster than
        when he was a woman.
      

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:52.570

        Exactly 10 minutes.


00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:55.870

        There's no doubt that
        testosterone can change the
      

00:37:55.870 --> 00:38:01.000

        body, but what effect does
        it have on the brain?
      

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.810

        Anyone who spends time with
        children is well aware that
      

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:06.550

        boys and girls tend to behave
        differently, and play
      

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:09.240

        differently.


00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.630

        It's always been assumed that
        these differences are largely
      

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:14.980

        driven by cultural and social
        pressures, but there's
      

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:19.170

        mounting evidence that this
        doesn't explain everything.
      

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:21.900

        Scientists are only just
        beginning to understand the
      

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.700

        role biology plays in shaping
        children's behavior.
      

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:30.310



00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:33.430

        There's no question, the
        children themselves know from
      

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.620

        a very early age what
        separates the
      

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.660

        boys from the girls.


00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:41.570



00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:44.990

        We don't like running,
        we like being gentle.
      

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:46.950

        We can play rough
        all the time.
      

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.980

        Girls put make-up
        and boys don't.
      

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:51.470

        My daddy always drives.


00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:55.360

        Boys do naughty things and we
        would do naughty things.
      

00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:00.290



00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:04.770

        Play behavior fascinates
        scientists like Melissa Hines.
      

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:07.470

        She's one of the leading figures
        in a unique long-term
      

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:10.320

        British study following children
        as they grow up.
      

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:14.420



00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.990

        The study is examining all
        aspects of developmental
      

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:21.450

        behavior, and has followed
        14,000 mothers and their
      

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:27.640

        children for the
        last 10 years.
      

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:31.290

        And it's uncovered intriguing
        evidence about biological
      

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:32.940

        influences.


00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.580

        The early indications are
        that testosterone
      

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.070

        influences play behavior.


00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:42.410



00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:45.350

        Boys and girls play differently
        because their
      

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:47.310

        brains are sexed differently.


00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:52.960



00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.050

        Just like the body, there are
        parts of the brain-- not the
      

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:58.090

        whole brain, but certain
        parts of it--
      

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:01.560

        that have receptors, or
        receiving units, for hormones,
      

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.240

        including testosterone.


00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.240

        And in other species, including
        non-human primates,
      

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:10.580

        like Rhesus monkeys, hormones
        program development of these
      

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.430

        brain regions.


00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:16.390

        If that's the case, what
        would testosterone
      

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:19.130

        due to a female brain?


00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:22.390

        Can the apparently cultural
        phenomenon of tomboys be
      

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:25.380

        explained by exposure to higher
        than average levels of
      

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:28.010

        testosterone in the womb?


00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:31.700

        There's some evidence that high
        levels of testosterone in
      

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:35.850

        the womb are one factor that
        influences the development of
      

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.210

        play behavior in human beings.


00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:41.540

        We know, for instance, that
        girls exposed to higher than
      

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.170

        normal levels of androgen--


00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:45.250

        male hormone, prenatally--


00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:49.540

        on the average show more male
        typical toy choices, like to
      

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:53.030

        play more often with
        boys, and show male
      

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:54.280

        typical activity patterns.


00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.980



00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:00.430

        If that's true, it will be
        fascinating to see what effect
      

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:02.270

        testosterone has on Max Toth.


00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:05.660



00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.120

        Hold on, you all right, Max?


00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.090

        Yep.


00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.030

        All right, we'll get you
        out of there now.
      

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:13.640

        Well, remember six months ago,
        Max was tested and had his
      

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:18.380

        brain scanned by
        Dr. Rubin Gur.
      

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:22.460

        Today Max has come back to be
        retested, to see if there have
      

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.270

        been any changes in the
        way that he thinks.
      

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:27.530



00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:30.850

        He will repeat the test he did
        in the brain scanner to see if
      

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:34.570

        testosterone he's been taking
        has produced any alterations
      

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:36.590

        in the structure and function
        of his brain.
      

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:41.900



00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.250

        Next test, it's called
        finger tapping.
      

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:45.480

        Ready?


00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.530

        He'll also repeats the
        other tests he did,
      

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:50.060

        when he was a woman.


00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.620

        Like finger tapping.


00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:55.800

        Men tend to have better motor
        skills and can, on average, do
      

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.460

        more finger taps per
        minute than women.
      

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:03.190

        Men are also stronger, and
        better at manipulating objects
      

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:05.990

        in three dimensions.


00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.940

        Women, however, tend to have
        better verbal skills and
      

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:12.220

        better visual memories.


00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:15.400

        These are standard scientific
        tests, and will show if,
      

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.780

        mentally, Max has become
        more like a man
      

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.810

        and less like a woman.


00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:25.470

        What I would expect to find
        is improved performance on
      

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:30.320

        functions, on tasks where
        males do better.
      

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:36.240

        And worsening performance on
        tests where women do better.
      

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.400

        They know they've never really
        studied this before.
      

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.170

        I'm interested to see if
        there's any difference,
      

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:42.250

        because, you know I've heard
        about the androgenizing
      

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:44.960

        effects of testosterone on the
        brain, so I'm interested to
      

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.420

        see, well, is anything
        changing?
      

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.390

        But I'm fairly dubious
        that anything will.
      

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:52.090



00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:55.170

        The first test measures Max's
        emotional response
      

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:58.590

        to a series of faces.


00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:02.070

        The machine takes pictures of
        Max's brain activity as he
      

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:05.530

        looks at faces, which can then
        be compared with his emotional
      

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:10.290

        response when he performed
        the same test as a woman.
      

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:11.760

        The results are startling.


00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:16.620



00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:20.620

        What we're seeing really is a
        female brain turning into a
      

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:21.260

        male brain.


00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:26.620

        It was quite amazing to see
        it on a single individual.
      

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.970

        This is a scan of Max's brain
        when he was a woman.
      

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:33.650

        The red area show which parts
        of the brain are used when
      

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:35.800

        trying to read emotions.


00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.850

        And this is a scan of Max's
        brain doing the same
      

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:42.060

        task, but as a man.


00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.890

        The more red in the scan
        picture, the harder the brain
      

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:46.810

        is working.


00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:49.970

        As you can see, he found it much
        easier to read emotions
      

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:52.780

        when he was a woman
        than he does now.
      

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:53.960

        Woman.


00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.080

        Man.


00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.330

        Woman.


00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:57.230

        Man.


00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:00.900

        In his case, the second
        time he had more
      

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.300

        difficulties with the task.


00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.720

        He had to put in more effort
        in order to perform that
      

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.110

        particular task.


00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:13.260

        So his brain responds more like
        a male brain to the task
      

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:14.780

        of trying to distinguish
        the emotions.
      

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:21.800



00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.760

        But how did Max do in
        the practical tests?
      

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:29.310



00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:33.870

        All the changes are in the
        direction that we expected, in
      

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:36.040

        terms of becoming
        more masculine.
      

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.190

        Interesting.


00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:39.520

        So, remember the
        finger tapping?
      

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:45.190

        You managed to squeeze in
        another three taps per minute.
      

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:46.540

        Woo-hoo.


00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:49.160

        Max is also much stronger.


00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:53.670

        You pushed another four kilos.


00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.560

        So that's significant.


00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:59.780

        His spatial awareness has
        dramatically improved.
      

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:04.960

        Last time you did 75 correct,
        this time you did 118 correct.
      

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.170

        That's pretty much the
        end of the good news.
      

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:13.830

        Because with becoming a male,
        you also lost a little bit.
      

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:17.320

        Max's visual memory has
        deteriorated, and he's not as
      

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.960

        good with words.


00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.740

        I was actually surprised.


00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:28.010

        I was thinking maybe one or
        two tests will change.
      

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:30.570



00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:34.120

        This is, after all, a fairly
        brief period of time.
      

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:38.280

        You would expect changes on
        those tests to take place over
      

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.860

        a longer period.


00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:44.490

        Max is still skeptical about
        the extent to which
      

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:48.920

        testosterone has changed his
        brain, but acknowledges that
      

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:52.590

        it has affected how he feels.


00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:53.710

        My body is changing.


00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:56.510

        And it has been surprising
        to go through that.
      

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:59.030

        It's been kind of exciting, and
        there were changes that I
      

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:00.290

        wasn't so--


00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:01.700

        that I didn't expect
        to go through.
      

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:03.480

        There was a period of
        time where I had a
      

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.070

        really hard time crying.


00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:07.420

        And it felt biological to me.


00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.430

        And by that, I mean I've gone
        through different periods in
      

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:14.780

        my life where I had a harder
        time crying, and had an easier
      

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:15.750

        time crying.


00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:18.430

        And this was the first time
        where I felt like I really
      

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:21.560

        wanted to cry, and there was
        something biochemical
      

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.140

        preventing me from doing it.


00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:25.150

        Like it really felt
        like a big block.
      

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:27.930

        And that was kind of a
        scary moment for me.
      

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:30.620



00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:34.560

        For Max, there's now
        no going back.
      

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.880

        As you can see, this time lapse
        sequence, he's already
      

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.010

        undergone remarkable changes
        in just six months.
      

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:44.960



00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.820

        In another year, he will
        look like this.
      

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:53.540



00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:57.700

        Further down the line, Max might
        consider having surgery
      

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.550

        to enhance his masculinity.


00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:03.010

        But, for now, he's
        happy with what
      

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:06.020

        testosterone alone has done.


00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:07.280

        I'm very excited.


00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:10.200

        Like, I didn't think I would
        be that excited about it.
      

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:14.230

        But the way that my body is
        changing shape, the way that
      

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:17.340

        my fat's redistributing, that
        my shoulders are getting
      

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:18.960

        broader, the facial hair.


00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.870

        It's really exciting for me.


00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:24.160

        It's starting to feel much more
        comfortable for me to be
      

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.720

        in my body.


00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:27.420

        And even some of my friends
        have noticed.
      

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:29.940

        They're like, wow, you're
        much more comfortable.
      

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:32.240

        And I just present more
        comfortable and more confident
      

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.260

        because I feel better.


00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:38.720

        Manipulating sex hormones has
        allowed Max Toth to make a
      

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:39.970

        choice about his gender.


00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:43.680



00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:46.920

        But science is only just
        beginning to explore what can
      

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.170

        be done to humans.


00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:53.270



00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:56.680

        Manipulating DNA to build
        super athletes, or even
      

00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:00.660

        radically redesigned humans,
        may be a long way off.
      

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:02.850

        But the future has
        a way of arriving
      

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:04.680

        faster than we imagine.


00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:09.280

        The question for society in the
        21st century is no longer,
      

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:13.480

        what can we do, but how far
        are we prepared to go?
      

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:19.240



00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:22.930

        Next week, aging.


00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:26.650

        Thanks to recent advances in
        molecular biology, it's now
      

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:30.670

        possible to explain exactly
        why we age.
      

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:34.170

        Scientists have now identified
        the rogue elements that cause
      

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:37.740

        aging, and have developed drugs
        that, for the first
      

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:39.480

        time, truly extend life.


00:48:39.480 --> 00:50:09.780
