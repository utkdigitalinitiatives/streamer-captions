MOYERS:
For 20 years now,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the artist and architect
Maya Lin has produced

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
a stunning body of work:

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
sculpture, earthworks,
memorials,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
interiors, buildings.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Her designs blend
the aesthetics of East and West

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
into a reverence for nature
and the evocation

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
of our human relationship
with our environment.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Born in Athens, Ohio,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Maya Lin was an undergraduate
at Yale University in 1981,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
when she won
the international competition

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to design the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial in Washington, D.C.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The choice hurled her into
the storm of the controversy

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
over the simplicity
of her design

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and over her own ethnicity.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
T!

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and today her work stands

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
as one of the great
public monuments of America.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I met Maya Lin recently

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
after reading her book,
 Boundaries,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and asked her about
how she came to design

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
the Civil Rights Memorial
in Montgomery, Alabama.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
LIN:
I got a phone call

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
from the Southern Poverty
Law Center,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and they asked me
over the phone,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
you know,
"Would you be interested

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
in designing
a civil rights memorial?"

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And I thought,
"Well, isn't there one already?"

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And he said,
"No, no, no, there isn't.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
"There's one for Martin
Luther King, but actually,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
"no one has really tackled
the Civil Rights Memorial

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
"as a piece.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Would you be interested?"

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And I had two feelings
at the time.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
One, I really did not want to be
typecast as a memorial designer.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Two, I could not believe

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that there hadn't been a
national civil rights memorial.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And so I asked them
to send me materials.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I was stunned

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
at how there was this part
of American history that, say...

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and I know now it's absolutely
covered in textbooks,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
but could I offer something out
as an information table

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
that would give people
a brief glimpse of that era

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
the way I had been...

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
sort of after having
looked at this material

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
been given a glimpse?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And of course, the idea is

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
you look at this,
you'll want to study it more,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
because the one thing
about sculptures,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the one thing about memorials is
I can draw you in.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I can make you think
for 15 minutes, whatever,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
then it's really about
where you go after that.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It starts with the 1954
 Brown v. Board of Education.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You walk around clockwise,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
it chronicles the history,
people's deaths,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
legislative events.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It was a sort
of cause and effect--

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
sometimes a person's action
led to better legislation,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
sometimes legislation led
to a riot and someone's death.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But what I wanted to stress here
is this was a people's movement,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and one person's actions
could really change history.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Because I think in the end,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
a lot of my works deal
with history and teaching.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It's not so much about death;

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
it's really
about sharing a history

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
so that we don't forget it,
so we can improve upon it.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
( water running softly )

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
MOYERS:
Where did the water come from,
the idea of the water?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
LIN:
The water was literally

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
on my first plane ride
down to see the site.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I came across
Martin Luther King's quote

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
from the Book of Amos
in his "I have a dream" speech:

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
"We are not satisfied.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
"We shall not be satisfied

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
"until justice rolls down
like waters

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and righteousness
like a mighty stream."

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I knew right then and there,
before the plane even landed,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
the piece was going to be
about water.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And what bothered me

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
about going down thinking
about the past in this one

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
is that it's not done.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
It's not a closed timeline.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
It's ongoing.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
What the Southern Poverty Law
Center is struggling with

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
is the ongoing, is the future.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So I needed something
to connect the past

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
which would be the history,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
which became the water table
with the talk about the future,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
which is the quote.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And then the water pulls them
together symbolically.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
One of my favorite pieces is
a piece called Wave Field.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
It's on the University
of Michigan north campus,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and the building surrounding it

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
teaches aerospace
and engineering,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
so, of course,
being site-specific,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I wanted to connect it

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
to what was going on
behind the building.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So I started talking
to the scientists,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
talking to the professors.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
They started giving me books
on aerodynamics, fluid dynamics.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And one of the books,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I came across this
repetitive water wave,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and I said, "That's the piece."

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Now, of course, I presented it
to the engineers,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and they were going,
"Well, that belongs

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
"over in naval engineering.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
It doesn't belong over here."

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
MOYERS:
Makes me want
to lie down there.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
LIN:
And kids do...

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Really?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Until the sprinklers come up.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I'm beginning to understand
the last line of your book,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
where you say,
"Maybe I'm just asking you

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
to pay closer attention
to the land..."

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Yeah. Definitely.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
"Whether the land is
a cemetery

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
or a sports
coliseum."

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Right.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Or in the middle of nowhere.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Where did this come from,
this intrigue about the land?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Growing up, southeastern Ohio--

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
it's very hilly,
very rural, beautiful.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
When I was growing up,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
we were going through
a very large campaign...

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I think Rachel Carson
had put out Silent Spring.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Lake Erie was catching on fire.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
DDT was decimating
bird populations.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I think at a very,
very early age,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I understood what it means
to have a species go extinct.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I was horrified

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that one species could do
this to another species.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And I think
what my work is about

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
is about appreciating and
being respectful of nature,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
which, again, ties in

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
to an inherent love
for the natural environment.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I will go to sites that are just
so beautiful beyond compare,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and I know that nothing I do
can ever be better.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
My favorite line from your book
comes very close to the end,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
where you write,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
"I do not think
you can find a reason

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
for everything
you make."

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Talk to me about that.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Everything you make is being
made by every single experience

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
you've ever had
in your whole life.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
On top of that, things you were
born with, just, you know,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I think...
your personality comes out.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
There's no way
of really saying, I...

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
it's like "If A, then B"

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
or "A plus B equals C"
in creativity.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And I think the true strength
of the creative arts

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
is that you allow yourself
to think about something,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and then how it finds its way
in your mind

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
to the surface
through your hands to...

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
whether it's paint, sculpture...

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I mean, others
outside the creative

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
might say it's intuited.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I mean, I think
there's reason to it,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
but could you extrapolate?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Could you actually formulate
a mathematical theorem?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Absolutely not.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
You couldn't put a pin
on a map of an idea.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
No, you could never do
that, nor would you want

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
to do that.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Somewhere I read

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
that an idea comes to you
like an egg.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Yeah.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Then the
question is,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
where does it get hatched?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
You know, I've never
thought about that.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
It's sort of the idea
of being...

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I will... I can work
on a project for three years,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
but you'll never see me
working on it.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I'll be designing other things,
doing other this...

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Generally, the first concept,
the initial idea,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
I can just wake up one morning--

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
after having not worked on it
for a year--

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
get up, do a sketch,
make a model,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and I know that's
what it is.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I'll sit down and
I'll just write

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
what I want to say here,
what needs to be said,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
how to do it.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And I try not to second-guess it
by finding a form

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and then trying to apply meaning
or function to the form,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
because then you're
trying to make...

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
if you have
the preconceived idea

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
of what you think it looks like

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
before you really
shape it verbally,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
then you're trying
to stuff function

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
into a pre-existing form.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So, I think what I love doing
in a lot of my works

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
is I like to write about it,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
because you can get
a conceptual sketch

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
of what you think you want
without any form.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And then usually
the form finds me.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Tell me about your
family background.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
LIN:
My mother was born in Shanghai;

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
my father, Fukien and Beijing--
he grew up in both places.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And they immigrated separately
to the States.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
They both ostensibly came out

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
because of the
communist takeover.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
My mother came out on
a scholarship to go to Smith.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
She got smuggled out on
a junk boat in Shanghai harbor

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
when the communists... when
the harbor was being bombed...

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
That was 1949.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
That would
have been '49.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Imagine you get sent out

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
with, I think, $50 sewn
into the neck of her coat,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
with a suitcase, never to see
your family ever again,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
never to see your country

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
until, you know, 30, 40...
you know, 40 years later.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I don't know
how they both did it.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
My father had a career in China.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
He was an academic
administrator.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And he came out midcareer,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
decided that he would never get
a comparable position in America

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
because he was Chinese,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
so at the age...
you know, I think late 30s

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
decided to study ceramics.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Goes to University
of Washington, takes up pottery.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
My father was brought up
fairly strictly.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
He wasn't allowed
to go into art in China.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And there he was,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
finally being able to get to do
what he wanted to do in America.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
But I think, again, the side of
the Chinese-American experience

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
which is arts-based,
scholar-based, education-based

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
is almost the... it's a
different side, and I think...

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
To the science
and the engineering?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Exactly.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And I think with it came
this unusual psyche

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
that we're not going
to force Tan or Maya

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
to do anything
they don't want to do.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
What were your parents'
expectations of you?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Education was key;
you had to study.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
But, again, we were never
forced to study,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
we sort of did it on our own.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I think there was
always an assumption

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
that our education was
what mattered.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
You could have done science,
you were good in science,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
you were good in math, you...

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I happen to know you were
first in your class.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
You could have become anything.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
You chose to be
an artist.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
The funny thing is there were
two sides growing up.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
There was a very academic...
this love of academia.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
I mean, books everywhere,
just...

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
My mother was a professor--

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
English professor,
Asian lit. professor.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And I think that was
what we assumed...

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
we're going to study,
study, study.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Meanwhile, my brother and I go
into my dad's ceramic studio

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
every day after school,
throwing clay at the clock

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
to cover it up--
drove my dad crazy.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I took it for granted.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Every day of my life,
I was making something.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I never thought
I would be an artist,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
because in a weird way...

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Oh, I was going to... I had
to get my doctorate, you know.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Everyone... We go, "We've
got to get our Ph.D.s."

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
I mean that was sort of what
I assumed would happen.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And so it's almost like,
oh, the bookish side

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
was technically supposed
to win out, right?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
But ironically, you know,
I chose architecture, in a way,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
because I thought it was
this perfect combination

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
of science, math and art.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
But the weird thing is

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
even though I love building
buildings, I'm an artist.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I've been an artist
from probably the first time

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I stepped into my dad's
ceramic studio.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Your home was full of ideas,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
it was full of art
and full of living.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Yeah, and I think
that's the other side

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
of the Chinese culture.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
How so?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
It was always

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
"As long as you're happy."

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
It wasn't, like, "In order
for you to be happy,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
you should do
this, this and this."

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
You don't have to be
a scientist.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
But that flies in the face
of the cliché

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
about Americans
of Chinese descent,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
because we're told
over and over again,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
"My mother and father said
I had to be a scientist,"

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
"I had to become a doctor,"

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
"I had to go
to graduate school."

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I mean, I think
my brother and I had

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
a really good giggle
about, you know, ten years ago,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
you know,
a poet and a sculptor--

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
technically
not great professions

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
in which to feed yourself.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And we were joking,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
"Gee, maybe Mom and Dad
should have made us worry

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
about, you know,
the realities of life."

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
But they were really
firmly believing

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
that we had
to kind of... grow here,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and that was
what was really important.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
You had to... you had to pursue

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
something that you really
had a passion for.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Did you fit in in Athens?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Did anybody ever make you feel
uncomfortable there?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
I was
so miserable

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
by the time
I got to high school,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and so I had pretty much
retreated into my own world.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Miserable because?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I was really out of place

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and didn't understand
why was out of place.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I mean, it seems so obvious.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
But if you're going through it,
you don't have a clue.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
I was... you know,
I was, you know...

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
if I look back, I was probably
an incredible, um...

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
you know, misfit.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
I had friends, but it was...
it wasn't like I belonged.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And I didn't...
I didn't want to date.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
I didn't...
I just wanted to study.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I loved to study.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
I had a really
hard time

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
with my identity.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And I think...
How so?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I really was in denial
about being Chinese American.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I wanted to fit in,
I wanted to be American.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And I think for the first
20 years of my life

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I really... I remember
when I was at Yale,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
like, I was try...
you know, you were recruited

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
by the Asian-American
society, AASA,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
and I was so uncomfortable.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
I was foreign in that group.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
I was the only...

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
If you think about it,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I was the only Chinese American
growing up,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
so I looked out at everyone,
and everyone is white.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
So what would make me
more uncomfortable is...

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and it...
so it was this horrible...

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
What would make you
more uncomfortable?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Hanging out with... a group
of Chinese Americans--

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and I knew that this was bad,
but at the same time...

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
You mean, feeling bad...

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Feeling bad,
like, "What is
wrong with you?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
You're Chinese American."

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And... and I remember
just politely declining

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
becoming part of...
of AASA at the time.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And it's taken me my next
20 years to really understand.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And what is ironic is
my work is so much inspired

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
as much by, I would say,
an Eastern sensibility,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
and that's coming from my father
and probably my mother.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
My mother
was a writer.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
So, even though
they didn't set you down

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
and talk about your Chinese
heritage or Asian heritage,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
they lived their heritage

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
in such a way

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
that it was
naturally imparted?

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Absolutely, I think.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I mean, that's the only way
I can reason it.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Was there a moment of awareness,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
a moment when you had to claim
your Chineseness?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I think
technically

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
not until my late 20s
did I really begin to see,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
as my body of work
began to grow,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
how my voice is a voice

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
that is very much coming out
of bicultural experience.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And I think it's my art that
kind of guided me to see it.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
It was never, like,
an intellectual...

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
like, "Oh, my work
is going to be

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
about
my Asian-American identity."

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
It was more like I just
make work, this is what I do.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And then I look back
and I go, "Oh, I get it."

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And is that
Eastern sensibility--

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
is that a preference, a taste
for simplicity, for the natural,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
for connecting to the flow
of the earth, the harmony of...?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I think so,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
and yet the funny thing is
I've never read

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
about Taoist thought,
I've never read about Zen.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Again, it's always
like I don't want to...

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I don't want
to make it conscious.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
If you look at any
of the works that I do,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
I'm very much against sort of
a didactic, teaching method,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
where you come in and I tell you

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
exactly what you should be
getting out of this piece.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Everything that I do
will be about...

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
I will put this out here,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
and it's up to you to come
to your own conclusions.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
That's
very Taoist.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And that's
so Taoist--

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
never trained.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And I think what's so funny
is I got into so much trouble.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And I think the main flak
with the Vietnam memorial came

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
after the Washington Post--

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
great headline: "An Asian
Memorial for an Asian War."

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
It was written by a journalist

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
who happened
to really know Taoism.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And he was going crazy, because
he was looking at this work

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
and going, "It is so Taoist,"

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
talking to me,
and I'm, like, going,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
"I... I don't know
anything about that."

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
But, of course, it's all there
because my parents--

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
the way we lived.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Think about it, um--
they never told us what to do,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000
they never tried to, like,
ever say, "You can't do this."

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
I mean, it was
a very unusual upbringing.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Would you read this?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
This is from...

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
This is from, um...
describing...

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
the design of
the Vietnam memorial:

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
"I had a simple impulse
to cut into the earth.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
"I imagined taking a knife
and cutting into the earth,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
"opening it up,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
"an initial violence and pain
that in time would heal.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
"The grass would grow back,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
"but the initial cut would
remain a pure, flat surface.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
"There was no need to embellish
the design further.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
"The people and their names
would allow everyone

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
"to respond and remember.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
"It would be an interface
between our world

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and the quieter, darker,
more peaceful world beyond."

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Where did that impulse to cut
into the earth come from?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
What I was studying

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
for the three months leading up
to the design of the memorial

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
was this funereal class.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
One of
the problems was

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
design a memorial
to World War III.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
One was design like a funeral...

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
like a cemetery cherub
or something.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
And so I had been
thinking about--

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
when I was designing a memorial
to World War III--

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
what is the nature
of a memorial?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
And I studied
World War I memorials.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
I went back to Trajan's Column.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
So again, research-- studied
something for a couple months,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
put it all away,
went to visit the site.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
No thinking,
just had an impulse.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
You didn't think metaphorically
about how the Vietnam War

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
had cut a great gash
in the psyche of this country?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
No.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And see, the...

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
I'm so naive that way
that especially when...

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
because I was, like, "Oh, yeah,
it's like cutting open the earth

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
and opening it up,"
and everyone said, "Scar?"

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
And the minute you say "scar"
in the media,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
it's, like,
"We don't want a scar."

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
The other thing
they read into

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
is that it's a "V" for victory.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And I kept going,
"Well, if you tried to do that

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
"as big as the memorial,
you'd break your fingers.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
It's really not that."

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
And the third one was
they read into the image

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
the color, black,
as being, again,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
a very negative statement.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Well, it was not only political,
Maya Lin,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
it was... it was personal.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
I mean, the most vicious
and venomous things

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
were said about you.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
You were called a gook.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
You were called,
you know...

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
making a tribute to Jane Fonda.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
I had no idea that there
was a problem with my race.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And I was so naive

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
that I remember at the very
first press conference,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
some reporter said,
"Don't you think it's ironic

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
"that the memorial is
the Vietnam memorial

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
and you're of Asian descent?"

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
And I looked at him, and I was,
like, "Well, that's irrelevant.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
"You know, this is America.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
That's irrelevant."

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Because I was brought up
in a very rarefied world

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
where what mattered
was what you thought.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
It's academia,
it's what you're thinking,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
and your gender didn't matter,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
your age didn't matter,
your race didn't matter.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
And I knew
I was right,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
and once it was up,
they would get it.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Well, how were you
so sure of that?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Because
I just knew.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
When you're so young,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
what do you have going for you?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Total belief
in what you've done.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
There was no doubt.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
I think as you get older, we...
we all begin to have doubts.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
I think when you're 20 years
old, you... you're right.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
What fascinates
me is

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
how I was never afraid
that it wouldn't work,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
whereas I think now,
absolutely, you'd be terrified.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
You'd be thinking, "Oh, my God,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
what if they're right
and I'm wrong?"

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
You don't have that

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
when you're
that age.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
I mean, but here
they were calling...

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
one of your competitors
called it an "open urinal..."

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
That one
I didn't see.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
You didn't
see that?
No.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Right-wingers called it
an "Orwellian..."

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
"Glop."

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
I love that one.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
I think that critic actually...

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
What I thought was fascinating
is after it was built,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
the letters I got from...

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
I think, the critic
of "Orwellian glop"--

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
because I remember that one--

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
actually wrote
a letter to apologize.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Of course, the... the bigotry
and the hatred and the racism

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
did not have the last word.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
The monument is the last word.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Yeah.
It is.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
And people who visit it
are visibly moved.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I go there many times,
and I never go there

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
without being moved myself

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
and without seeing everyone
who is passing by deeply moved.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Why do you think
they are so moved by it?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
I think because it's tapping
into some very important,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
I would say ancient needs.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
I think fundamentally, um...
when I was designing it,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
I thought
about the nature of death

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
and acknowledging
death.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
It's extraordinary to watch
people touch the names.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
It's as if something
were passing

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
back and forth

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
between the name
and the touch.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
And there's something very quiet
and very intimate.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
I didn't grasp the pow... why
it was so powerful to be there

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
until I actually read
the sentence from your essay

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
where you say,
looking at that black marble,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
"It would be an interface
between our world

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
and the quieter, darker,
more peaceful world beyond."

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
LIN:
Right.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
And it's a world we can't enter,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
because we can't pass
through those names.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
And it's painful.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
But again, I mean...

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
And I had not known
anyone who had died.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
I just had a feeling
that it's got to be

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
the most painful, um, experience
that you will ever go through.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
But what you have is the memory.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
And you have to accept it,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
and then you have to turn around
and walk back into the light.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
But if you don't accept it,
you'll never get over it.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Maya Lin,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
thank you very much.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Oh, you're welcome.
