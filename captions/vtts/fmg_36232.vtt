One of science's
greatest theories,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
evolution,
is under attack.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The threat is emerging

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
from the only scientific
superpower on earth,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
provoking some of the biggest
names in science to hit back.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
(Dawkins)
It's enormously damaging

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
if the world's leading
economic power was subverted

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and undermined by this kind
of antiscientific tendency.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
(narrator)
The controversy surrounds
a new explanation

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
for the diversity
of life on Earth.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
For many, it threatens
to replace science with God.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
(Attenborough)
It is so
fundamentally against

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
every scientific principle
that you can think of,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that to put it
in the same bracket

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
is to seriously
confuse thinking.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
(narrator)
And yet, this new idea

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is gaining
powerful support.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000

This is the story of a battle

a defining moment
in the scientific landscape

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
of the 21st century.

(Miller)
I truly regard

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
America's scientific soul
to be at stake

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in this struggle.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And losing that, I think,
would be a great tragedy.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and it's about the ridiculous
theory of evolution

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000

In September 2005,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
a landmark legal case
began in America.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
On trial was one of
the greatest names in science,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Charles Darwin.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
[shutters clicking]

There is, in fact, a legitimate
scientific controversy

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
over Darwin's
theory of evolution.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
(narrator)
What started as
a local high school dispute

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
has spiraled
into a battle

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
that pitted God
against science.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The spark for this conflict
is a controversial new idea

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
that directly
challenges Darwin.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It is called
"intelligent design."

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
(man)
What's your opinion
on intelligent design?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
(man)
 My opinion on
 intelligent design

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
is that it is a legitimate
 scientific theory.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
(narrator)
The supporters
of intelligent design

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
make an extraordinary claim:

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
to have found
scientific evidence

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
for a supernatural
creator of life.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
All of the leading
scientific organizations

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
have taken a position
that intelligent design

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
is not science,
that it injects a conflict

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
between science and religion
where none need exist.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000

From America to Europe,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
the popularity
of the movement is growing.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
For many,
it could mark the beginning

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
of a scientific dark age.

to the American public
about science,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
you can lie to them
about anything.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And that's why this case
is so important.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
(narrator)
This case is the latest
in a battle

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
that stretches
back almost 150 years,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
to a single book,
 On the Origin of Species.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
With his theory of evolution,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Charles Darwin shattered the
fundamental beliefs of his time.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
He hypothesized
that all life on Earth

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
had descended from the first
simple organisms,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
that we were just another animal
on a great tree of life.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
For the first time,
science had directly challenged

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the biblical story
of creation.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
The conflict continues
to this day.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
(Attenborough)
Quite a lot of people
are upset

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
that the findings
of evolutionary science

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
don't coincide with what
is written in Genesis.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And there are people
who think that Genesis

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
should be
taken literally,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
that, according to Genesis,
a creator God took mud

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and blew into it
and created the first man.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Now, there are people who
believe that is literally so.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And if they do so, the basis
that they think it is so

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
is a manuscript,
is a human document.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It's nothing to do
with the world out here.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
(narrator)
The logical consequences
of Darwin's findings

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
were even more
unsettling.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
If the story of creation
could be doubted,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
so too could the existence
of the Creator.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Darwin had given rise
to a disturbing vision:

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
a world without God.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
(Miller)
To many people,
if we are just material beings,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
any notion of a grand purpose,
of a meaning to their lives,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
is merely an illusion,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
an illusion that Charles Darwin
smashed in 1859.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
(Attenborough)
The notion that we are masters
of our destiny

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
is one which they found
abhorrent.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And that was why Darwin's views

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
were so heretical
and so upsetting.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
He found them
upsetting himself.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
(narrator)
Darwin likened his theory
to confessing to a murder.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
But it was
the scientific evidence,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
not his religious belief,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
that Darwin
was compelled to accept.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
The battle lines
had been drawn.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Throughout the 20th century,
religious communities in America

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
fought to prevent the spread
of Darwin's dangerous idea.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
In 1925, in an infamous
court case in Tennessee,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
high school teacher John Scopes
was tried

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
for teaching evolution.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
(male announcer)
All attention focuses now
on the prospect

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
of an epic debate
of science versus religion,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
reason versus faith.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
(narrator)
Scopes was found guilty
and fined $100.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Now millions
of American children

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
learned nothing
of evolution.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Biblical creationism
dominated the classroom.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And it just seems that the birth
of every individual child

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
is a miracle right there,
a miracle that you can behold...

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
even though
 it's a miracle...

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
(woman)
I believe

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
that God created the world
in seven days,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
exactly, literally,
just how He said He did.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
(narrator)
It took 60 years

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
for the creationists
to finally lose their battle.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
In 1987, the highest court
in America ruled

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
that teaching creationism
was unconstitutional.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
It violated the required
separation of church and state.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Creationism was banned
from the science curriculum.

Despite the change
in the law,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
the resistance to evolution
never went away.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
In June 2004, no one
in the small town of Dover

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
could have imagined
that they would trigger

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
the next great battle
over the teaching of evolution.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
It all began
with a struggle for control

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
of the local high school.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Casey and Jeff Brown were
members of the governing board

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
when something changed.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
(Jeff Brown)
I didn't notice it
at the time,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
because I didn't think
it was important.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
But what
had happened,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
without me ever considering
that it should matter, was,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
we were getting
an overwhelming number

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
of fundamentalist Christians
on the board.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
These people are convinced
that evolution is a hoax.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
In their opinion,
nothing can contradict

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
anything in the Bible
and possibly be true.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000

The flashpoint came
when the board came to review

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
the school's
new biology textbook.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
One member immediately
objected to what he read.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
12 mentions of Charles Darwin
in a 1,400-page textbook.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
He objected
to those 12 mentions,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and he claimed the book
was "laced with Darwinism,"

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
quote, unquote.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000

Brian Rehm was
a science teacher at the school

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
when the new board members
began to exert their influence.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
(Rehm)
I was hired at Dover
in September of 2002.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I would say, by October,
I heard rumblings,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
coming through
the assistant superintendent,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
that the school board
had problems with evolution.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
On one hand, I was shocked
when I heard about this.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
On the other hand,
I wanted to laugh.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
(narrator)
When Rehm discussed the issue
with the board chairman,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
he was met
with more concerns.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
(Rehm)
He said,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000

"and they've had evolution
biology class,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
"we're going to sit down
at the dinner table,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
"and I'm going to have to tell
them that you, the teacher,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
has lied
to my children."

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I left this meeting thinking,
I can't believe

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
that somebody thinks that
the teachers teaching science

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
are actually intentionally lying
to the children.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
It just blows
my mind.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
(narrator)
The wave of antievolutionary
sentiment

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
continued to take over.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
(Jeff Brown)
At our next meeting,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
some of us were discussing
the drawbacks

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
of teaching creationism,
mainly that it is illegal,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
at which point Mr. Buckingham
looked at me and said,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
"2,000 years ago,
someone died on a cross for us.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Isn't it about time
we do something for him?"

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
(Rehm)
At that point in time,
I saw where they were going.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
The school board
is anti-teacher,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
anti-public education.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
They're antiscience.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And I said,
"I'm getting out."

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
(Casey Brown)
My feeling,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
coming out of the meeting,
was fear.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
I knew we were in
the minority at that point.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
(narrator)
This was just a prelude.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Dover was to become
the focus for a new battle

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
between Darwin's
theory of evolution

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and its most
formidable opponent yet,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
intelligent design.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
The man behind the latest
challenge to Darwin

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
is Phillip Johnson,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
celebrated lawyer
and born-again Christian.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
In the late 1980s,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Johnson began developing
a strategy to overthrow Darwin,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
to reclaim
the story of creation.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
For Johnson, the theory of
evolution was not just science;

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
it was the cornerstone
of Western culture.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
(Johnson)
The Darwinian theory
of evolution

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
is the grand creation story
of our culture.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Every culture
has a creation story--

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
creation myth,
if you like.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Now, the creation story
is the basis

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
for every kind of knowledge
in that culture.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And for that reason,
the experts

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
who have the authority
to tell the creation story

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
to the public
have great power.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And they always have--
or at least want--

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
a monopoly of that power.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
They don't want
to share it to anybody.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
(narrator)
As a lawyer,
there was an obvious way

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
for Johnson
to challenge Darwin.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
He would put him
on trial.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
(Johnson)
How much of this
grand creative story

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
has anybody
ever actually seen?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
How much can be tested
by experiment,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and what have
the experiments been?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
(narrator)
To defeat Darwin,
Johnson would have to unravel

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
the driving force behind
his theory, natural selection.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Natural selection explained
how life evolved

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000
from the first
simple organisms...

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:49.000
how in nature,
the fittest win out...

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
leaving more offspring

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
with more of their
desirable characteristics.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
This survival of the fittest
would, over time,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
allow a species
to change and develop,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
until eventually,
new species could arise.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Given billions of years,
natural selection could create,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
unguided, the diversity
of life on Earth.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
But like many before him,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Johnson was unconvinced
by the evidence.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
(Johnson)
The problem
with the Darwinian story

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
is not that it's altogether
false, certainly;

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
it's that perhaps it's true
within a much more limited scale

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
than is usually claimed.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
(narrator)
Johnson believed
Darwin's theory

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
was just part of a much greater
problem with science.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
By attempting
to explain the world

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
solely through
natural causes,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
science was excluding
the supernatural.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Science was
inherently antireligious.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
(Johnson)
The Darwinists claim
we must keep God

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and any form
of supernatural creation

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
out of science,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and nature
had to be capable

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
of doing all
of its own creating.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
(narrator)
Johnson thought science
unfairly ruled out God

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
as a creator.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
It couldn't even entertain
the possibility.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Johnson didn't know if anyone
would take him seriously,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
but a fortuitous encounter
would change everything.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
(Meyer)
I got a call from
a fellow graduate student.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And he told me
that he had a friend

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
who was a quirky law professor,
who was drop-dead brilliant.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And he'd gotten obsessed
with evolution.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
He said, "Would you
talk to him?"

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And he said it in such a way
that led me to think

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
that I probably needed
to straighten this poor guy out.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
We got about 15 minutes
into the conversation

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
before I realized,
this quirky law professor

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
was indeed drop-dead brilliant,
and he had put his finger

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
on the pulse
of the central issue

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
in the debate
about biological origins.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
(Johnson)
Here's somebody
getting a doctorate

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
in the philosophy of science
at Cambridge University

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
and studying these issues
at a professional level,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
who has come to
much the same conclusions

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
through much the same process
of thinking that I have.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
And we started asking
the question among ourselves:

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
how many more people
are there like this?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
(narrator)
Together, Johnson and Meyer
went in search of scientists

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
who could share
their vision.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
One of them was biochemist
Michael Behe.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
(Behe)
Meeting other people who were
skeptical of Darwinian evolution

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
was really wonderful,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
because if you think
something is wrong

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
and the whole world
thinks it's right, well,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
maybe you're crazy.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
But meeting
just one other person

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
who thinks the way that you do
and sees your reasons

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
and is willing to talk
about this, well,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
that means
that you're not crazy.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
(narrator)
Inspired by Johnson,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Behe focused
on the weakness

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
that Darwin had highlighted
in his theory.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
(Behe)
He wrote at one point
that if it could be demonstrated

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
that any complex organ existed
which could not be put together

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
by numerous, successive,
slight modifications,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
he said, my theory
would absolutely break down.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
(narrator)
Darwin's theory relied
on the step-by-step evolution

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
of complex organisms
from simpler ones.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Behe went in search
of an organism

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
that didn't fit
the theory.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
He became intrigued
by a mechanism

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
found amongst a family
of microscopic bacteria,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
the flagellum.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
(Behe)
Bacterial flagellum
is literally an outboard motor

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
that bacteria
use to swim.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
(narrator)
Although on the surface the
flagellum appeared to be simple,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
when Behe looked inside,
he saw a mechanism

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
made of 50 different
interacting parts.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
You can just see from the way
that the parts are situated

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
that this is a machine.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
(narrator)
If just one part
was missing,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
the flagellum
appeared to be useless.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Anything less than the whole
simply wouldn't work.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
It pointed to one thing:

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
that this machine had not
evolved from a simpler organism.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
(Behe)
It's really, really
difficult to see

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
how it could be
put together gradually,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
with the thing working
and getting better

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
at each step
of the way.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
I thought to myself,
"That's it. That's the problem.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
That's what Darwin's theory
has problems with."

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
(narrator)
Behe was certain
he had the evidence

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
to challenge
Darwin's theory.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
If the flagellum
could not have come about

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
through gradual stages,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
it must have been created
in its complete form.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
And for that to happen,
Behe concluded

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
that there must have been
some form of creator,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
an intelligence.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
(Behe)
Eventually I came
up with a name for it.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
I called it
"irreducible complexity."

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
(narrator)
Irreducible complexity

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
was a simple
but provocative idea.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
It was based on the observation
of natural machines

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
whose parts were
so interdependent

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
that they could not
have evolved.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And irreducible complexity
appeared to be everywhere,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
right down
to the design

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
of some of the smallest
building blocks of life.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
(Behe)
You have to look down
to the molecular level,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
and when you do that,
you see machinery.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
And when you put
those two concepts together,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
of looking
at molecules

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
and worrying about
irreducible complexity,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
you can really understand
that Darwinian theory

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
can't explain life,
at least not all of it.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
(narrator)
With the addition of
mathematician William Dembski,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
the next assault on Darwin
was about to begin.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
(Dembski)
I was really going solo.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
I had these intuitive doubts
about Darwinian theory.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
It just seemed to me
very implausible

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
that the sorts of things

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
that evolution
was supposed to explain--

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
the large-scale changes
in organisms--

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
that those could be
within the reach

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
of these sorts
of chance mechanisms.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
(narrator)
Dembski would challenge
a concept

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
at the center
of evolutionary theory:

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
the mathematical probability
of life evolving by chance.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
To do this, he would unpick
the blueprint of life,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
the extraordinarily
complex code of DNA.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
It's a rather
elegant molecule--

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
I think one might almost say
a beautiful molecule--

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
that carries us all
through our lives,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
makes us what we are, regulates
 our brains and bodies.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
(narrator)
As DNA is passed from
one generation to the next,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
tiny, random changes
take place.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
According to
evolutionary theory,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
it is these chance
genetic mutations

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
that generate variation
within a species

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
and allow evolution
to work,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
over time,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
creating the diversity
of life on Earth.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
But Dembski doubted
the probability

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
of that really happening.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
According to his calculations,
the complexity of nature

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
was beyond
the limits of chance.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Even relatively simple
organisms such as a moth

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
have DNA sequences hundreds
of millions of units long.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
And they have to be
in such precise order

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
that chance alone
could not explain.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
(Dembski)
There's a point at which

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
there's a breakdown,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
and these chance-based
mechanisms cannot explain

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
the sorts of complexities
we see in biological systems.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
(narrator)
The theory of evolution
was not just improbable;

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
it appeared to be
mathematically impossible.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
For Dembski, there had to be
something else shaping life.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
(Dembski)
The only causal power
that we know

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
that could produce
something like this

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
is intelligence.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Engineers,
human engineers,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
have produced
systems like this.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
(narrator)
Dembski had put together
a mathematical case

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
to rule out the chance mechanism
of Darwin

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
and rule in the organizing power
of an intelligence.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Now the movement
had a new hypothesis

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
to set alongside Behe's idea
of irreducible complexity.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Together,
they claimed it was evidence

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
for a supernatural power.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
They had forged
the seemingly impossible:

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
evidence of a creator
based on science, not religion.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Intelligent design
had arrived.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
(Johnson)
We saw an opportunity
to change the world

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
by moving debate away from this
Bible-versus-science stereotype

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
and into the question of whether
the scientific evidence,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
when examined
impartially,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
really justified and supported
the grand claims of Darwinism.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
(narrator)
Out of Johnson's group
came a stream of books,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
gatherings,
and media presentations,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
each advancing
the intelligent design argument.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Many welcomed the return
of the supernatural

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
to the story
of creation.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
They weren't the ones
they needed to convince most.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
The response from
the scientific community

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
has been almost--
not completely but almost--

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
uniformly negative.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
(narrator)
One of the most dismissive
responses has come

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
from one of Darwin's
most staunch defenders,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Richard Dawkins.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
(Dawkins)
What this does
to science is,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
it wastes
a lot of time

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
of scientists who could be
getting on with their work.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
As far as I'm aware,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
in no other field of science
does this happen.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Physicists don't have to fight
a kind of rearguard action

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
against sort of yapping terriers
of ignorance

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
the way biologists do.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
(narrator)
For the past 30 years,
Dawkins has been on a mission

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
to explain evolution
and its impact

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
on the existence of God...

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Because people cannot come
to terms with evolution,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
the blind designer...

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
(narrator)
For Dawkins, there was only
one way to treat this assault

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
on his science
and his beliefs.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
He simply snubbed them.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
(Dawkins)
The debate format
gives the false impression

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
that there are here two sides
of a scientific disagreement.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
That's not the case.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Creationists have
in effect won their goal

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
when a real scientist agrees
to have a debate with them.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
And that, immediately,
carries the propaganda victory

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
that they crave.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
(narrator)
But the proponents
of intelligent design

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
were more than ready
to defend their claims.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
(Dembski)
This is a spirited
scientific discussion.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
The problem is
that the other side

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
does not want to admit that
it is a scientific discussion,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
because as soon
as they do,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
then we have a place
at the table.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
And then the critique
of evolutionary theory

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
that we offered
has to be taken seriously.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Scientific revolutions
have happened in the past.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
We're thinking that this
is going to be one of them.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
The other side thinks
that we're hopelessly misguided.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
(narrator)
Despite the lack
of credibility

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
amongst the vast majority
of scientists,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
the movement launched
by Johnson 1 1/2 decade ago

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
yields more power
than ever.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
From his base
in Seattle,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Meyer runs a
multimillion-dollar think tank,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
the Discovery Institute's
Center for Science and Culture.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
It is the most
formidable force

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
in the battle
against evolutionary theory.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
(Meyer)
There is a growing group
of dissenting scientists

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
around the world
who are dissenting

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
from Darwinian evolution.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Now over 450 scientists
have signed a list

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
saying that they doubt
that natural selection

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
can produce
the complexity of life.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
It may be a minority position
within science,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
but it's
a growing minority

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
and one which we think
has the support

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
of an enormous amount
of evidence

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
about the complexity
and interworkings

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
of cellular life.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
(Dawkins)
When one says
that in America,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
intelligent design
is getting a hold,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
it is not getting a hold
in the scientific community,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
in the intellectual
community.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
It's getting a hold

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
only among those parts
of the population

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
who don't know anything.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
(narrator)
Many critics see
in intelligent design

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
a greater purpose
than their stated pursuit

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
of science alone.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Barbara Forrest has charted
the rise of the movement

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
and studied the Discovery
Institute's tactics.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Their underlying aims
were exposed when, in 1999,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
a fundraising document,
 The Wedge, was leaked.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
(Forrest)
It is designed to have

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
the idea of intelligent
design permeate

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
all of the academic
disciplines,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
to change social
and political policy,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
really to radically alter
the nature of American life.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
And it is a very clear statement
of the religious nature

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
of what they're doing--

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
in their own words.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
(narrator)
The revelations
of the leaked document

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
haven't held back
the movement.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
(Forrest)
They have developed
a very successful PR slogan.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
It's called
"teach the controversy."

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
That's a good little sound bite
that they use,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
and it appeals to the basic
sense of fairness

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
that's characteristic
of the American public.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
And it's the idea
that schoolchildren

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
should hear both sides
of a genuine controversy,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
as they tell it,
that it's not fair

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
to deny them
this opportunity

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
to hear about an alternative
scientific theory.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
(narrator)
And powerful people
are listening.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
In August 2005,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
intelligent design
received the backing

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
of President George W. Bush.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
In an interview
with newspaper journalists,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
he stated, "Both sides
ought to be taught."

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
(Bush)
We have a calling
from beyond the stars

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
to stand for freedom,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
and America will always
be faithful to that cause.

A world away in Dover,
Pennsylvania,

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
the battle over the high school
science curriculum

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
was still raging.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Throughout the summer of 2004,
a faction of the school board

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
had been trying to get
creationism

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
back into
the science class

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
but had come up against
a stumbling block.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
(Jeff Brown)
The Dover school board
did not initially discuss

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
teaching
intelligent design.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Initially they wanted to teach
creationism,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
the book of Genesis,
side-by-side with evolution,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
give them equal time.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
And we kept pointing out,
"This is illegal.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
the Supreme Court has said
you can't do that.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
(narrator)
The dispute had already driven
science teacher Brian Rehm

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
out of his job.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
But he and his wife,
Christy, still had

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
three children
attending the school.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
(Christy Rehm)
We just made the decision

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
that we would attend
school board meetings

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
and we would, you know, question
everything that was happening

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
and made sure that they had
answers for everything.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
(Rehm)
If you walked in that door
for 30 seconds,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
you knew what was going
on was not the way

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
it's supposed to happen.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
It was that bad
and out of control.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
(narrator)
The board were trying to drive
through a new proposal

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
to introduce a textbook

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
that contained the theory
of intelligent design.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
(Jeff Brown)
At the very next meeting,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
that's when they proposed
that we change the curriculum

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
to make a special reference
to this book.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
The room was hot;
it was crowded,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
and there were just people
lined up along the wall,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
waiting for their turn
to speak to this board

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
and plead with them,
"Don't do this."

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
(Jeff Brown)
Finally the board voted,
six to three,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
to change the curriculum,
at which point,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
my wife and I
both resigned.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000
We couldn't stop these clowns.
That was the feeling I had.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
They crossed a line
with that vote.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
They went from protecting
their religion

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
to promoting
their religion,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
and that I could not
countenance.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
We couldn't.
We couldn't.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
(narrator)
For the Rehms and other parents
opposed to the policy,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
they still had
a chance: the law.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
They would sue the board
for promoting religion

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
in the science class.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000

* When God dips His love
in my heart. *

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
(Weinstock)
11 parents of Dover students
are now in court,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
suing the Dover school district

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
over exposing their children
to a controversial concept

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
called "intelligent design,"

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
a theory that they say
promotes religion

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
and creates false doubts
about evolution.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
(Rehm)
We need to do this
for the community.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
These people,
this small minority

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
that's on
the school board,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
has really hijacked
this town

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
and taken it down
the wrong pathway.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
And nobody seems to be
stopping it.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Nobody seems to be trying
to stop them, and it's wrong.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
So if no one else is going to do
it, it's my last shot.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
I'm going to try and stop them,
because I know it's wrong.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
People are starting
to wake up,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
and I'm hoping we can change it
before it's too late.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
(narrator)
The stage was set for the latest
round of the evolution wars.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
The world's media
descended.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
May I have
your name, sir?

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Yeah, my name is
Matthew Chapman.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
And what is your relationship
 with Charles Darwin?

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
He was my great-great
grandfather.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
(woman)
At this courthouse,
evolution and intelligent design

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
are at the center
of a national debate,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
and it's not the first time
evolution has been put on trial.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Some say it's the Scopes trial
all over again,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
just reversed.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
(narrator)
The local spat
had gone global.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000
The board members were advised
to stay silent by their lawyer.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
He would present
their case to the world.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
(man)
Should the ninth grade
biology students

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
be made aware
of the fact

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
that there is a controversy
in the scientific community

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
about Darwin's
theory of evolution?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
(narrator)
Finally, the scientific claims
of intelligent design

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
would be put
to the ultimate test.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
The positive proposition that
life could have been created

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
by an intelligent designer
is not science.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
(narrator)
If intelligent design was found
to be based on religion,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
it would not only be barred
from the Dover classroom,

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
but its scientific validity
would be ruined.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
(male announcer)
The first witness called
by attorneys for the parents

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
was Dr. Kenneth Miller.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
(narrator)
One of the scientists leading
the defense of Darwin's theory

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
was biologist
Kenneth Miller.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
[applause]

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
For years,
Miller had lectured nationwide,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
alerting audiences
to the perceived threat he saw

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
in intelligent design.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Right now we are losing
the battle for public opinion

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
on this issue.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
These guys have had
 a field day,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
and they've captured
the popular imagination.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
(narrator)
Miller had drawn together
the scientific evidence

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000
to respond to
intelligent design's claims.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
(Miller)
 Many bacterium
 have little flagella,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
whiplike structures

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
that propel them
through the cell,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
and you can see them
in this electron micrograph.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
(narrator)
Miller targeted the pillar
of intelligent design,

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Michael Behe's argument
of irreducible complexity

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
and its most vivid example,
the flagellum.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
(Miller)
 The notion

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
of intelligent design
or irreducible complexity

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
makes a prediction

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
that if intelligent design
is the proper explanation,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
the parts of these
complex machines

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
should be useless
on their own,

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
because all the parts
have to be there

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
to have any function
whatsoever.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
(narrator)
Miller quickly discovered,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
amongst the scientific
literature,

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
evidence that
challenged Behe.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Within the flagellum

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
there was a simpler
functioning mechanism,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
a bacterial syringe.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
(Miller)
 This system

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
is missing 40
of its 50 parts--

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
80%--and it is
perfectly functional.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
So the kindest thing
one can say about this claim,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
which is
the essential claim

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
of irreducible
complexity/intelligent design,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
is that it's wrong.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
It is simply wrong
on the basis of the science.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
(narrator)
For Miller, the prediction
of irreducible complexity

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000
was disproved.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
The flagellum
could be broken down

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
into other simpler
biological mechanisms.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
In two days
of testimony,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Miller attempted to knock
down the arguments

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
for intelligent design,
one by one.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Also on his hit list:

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Dembski's criticism
of evolution

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
that it was simply
too improbable.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000
(Miller)
One of the mathematical tricks
employed by intelligent design

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
involves taking
the present-day situation

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
and calculating
probabilities

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
that the present
would have appeared randomly

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
from events in the past.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
And the best example
I can give

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
is to sit down
with four friends,

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
shuffle a deck of 52 cards
and deal them out

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
and keep
an exact record

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
of the order in which
the cards were dealt.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
We could then
look back and say,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
"My goodness,
how improbable this is.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
"We could play cards
for the rest of our lives,

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
"and we would never,
ever deal the cards

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
out in this
exact same fashion."

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
You know what?
That's absolutely correct.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Nonetheless,
you dealt them out,

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
and nonetheless,
you got the hand that you did.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
(narrator)
For Miller,

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Dembski's maths
did not add up.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
The chances
of life evolving,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
just like the chance of getting
a particular hand of cards,

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
could not be
calculated backwards.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
By doing so, the odds
were unfairly stacked.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Played that way, cards and life
would always appear impossible.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
With the trial
reaching a climax,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
the argument intensified.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Contrary to Professor Miller,
I think Darwinism,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000
to a large degree,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
acts to stifle science
in some respects.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
The scientific evidence
from the bacterial flagellum,

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
from the molecular machinery
in the cell,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000
just points to design.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
It doesn't address
the question

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
of how that design
was put in place.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
By the terms
of the advocates

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
of intelligent design
themselves,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
the designer creates
outside of nature,

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
supernaturally, by means
that are undetectable.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
And if those means
are undetectable,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
they're not susceptible
to scientific observation

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000
or analysis.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
And therefore,
the whole idea is not science.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
A theory that explains
everything,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
in fact,
explains nothing.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
And that's the central flaw
of intelligent design.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
(narrator)
The destiny
of intelligent design

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
would now be in the hands
of the judge.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Scientists round the world
waited.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
(Dawkins)
Design needs
to postulate an entity

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
at least
as complicated,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
at least as
high-information content,

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000
at least
as irreducibly complex,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
as that which it
is supposed to explain.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
It therefore is a total lack
of explanation.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
It doesn't explain
anything,

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
because it can't
explain itself.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:11.000
(Attenborough)
Science is an observation-based
way of thinking.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
If you then move
from that and say,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
"We can't find
any evidence,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
and therefore it was made
by God or something or other,"

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
that simply moves
into a totally different kind

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
of intellectual discourse
and is utterly different.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
It becomes
not objective,

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
which all science is,
but subjective.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
(narrator)
The stakes
couldn't be higher.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
The conflict had spread

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
to the world's largest
Christian congregation,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
the Roman Catholic Church.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
In July 2005, one of the most
powerful men in the church,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
the archbishop of Vienna,
wrote an article

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
in one of America's
most influential newspapers.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
These few words
supporting intelligent design

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
had broken the church's silence
over the issue.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
It triggered a crisis.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
(Coyne)
He's a high churchman.
He's close to the pope.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
He had to know that it
would have ramifications.

Father George Coyne

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
has devoted his life
to reconciling the findings

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
of science with God.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
A Jesuit priest
and astrophysicist,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
he is also director

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
of one of the key scientific
bodies within the faith,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
the Vatican Observatory.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
(Coyne)
Churchmen above all

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
are tired of this materialistic
interpretation of science.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
And so when they hear the word
"God designed it,"

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
they're immediately
on the hook.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
A lot of them are not capable
of distinguishing

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
that that hook
is double-barbed.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
So the ground is fertile
for the influence

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
of intelligent design,
to my mind.

Darwin's theory has never sat
easily with Catholic belief,

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
but over
a 50-year period,

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
culminating
with Pope John Paul II,

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
the church
came to accept

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000
that Darwin's theory
was no obstacle to faith.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Then came the article
from Cardinal Schoenborn.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
(Coyne)
I don't think he appreciated
what an uproar he would create

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
by saying--which he said
very clearly--

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
neo-Darwinian evolution
is not compatible

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
with Catholic doctrine.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
And that's wrong.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
It is compatible
with Catholic doctrine.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
(narrator)
Months after
Pope John Paul II's death,

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Schoenborn was reigniting
the argument over evolution.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
He was embracing
intelligent design.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
(Coyne)
If the pope was living,

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000
he could have never gotten
away with that, okay?

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
He would have been
called in.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
(narrator)
But behind Schoenborn's article,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
there appeared to be
other forces at work.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000
He was known to be in contact
with an official

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
of the leading
intelligent design think tank,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
the Discovery Institute.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
There is one
Discovery fellow who knew him

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000
and encouraged him
to write on this.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
And you asked if that was
beyond the remit

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000
of a scientific organization.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Beyond a strictly
scientific organization, yes.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
The--our--we have a think tank;
we're concerned--

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
the Discovery Institute
is concerned--

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
about developing
the scientific research

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
but also about the cultural
implications of the issues.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
(narrator)
Later, it came to light
that the article

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
had been passed
to The New York Times

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
by the institute's
public relations agency.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
The move provoked outrage
amongst Catholic scientists

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
the world over.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
(Coyne)
Intelligent design
is a movement.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
They use every opportunity
they can to--

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
it's a scare word;
it's not a nice word to use--

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
to manipulate.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000
There was some report
that, you know,

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
the Discovery Institute
had used him as a puppet

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000
or something, but this was
clearly his own initiative.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
He has been used,
Cardinal Schoenborn,

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
has been used by the
intelligent design movement,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
to the extent
that I'm not sure

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
he wrote The New York Times
op-ed piece himself.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
(narrator)
Cardinal Schoenborn has since
qualified his criticism

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
of evolutionary theory.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.000
(Coyne)
Intelligent design is a movement
on behalf of religion,

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000
and it's going to destroy
not just science but religion.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
(narrator)
Through the whole affair,

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
proponents of intelligent
design stood by their claim

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
that it is science

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
and have never stated
who the designer is.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
(Meyer)
People who uphold a traditional
theistic perspective

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
certainly welcome the results
of our scientific work,

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
because the God of theism
is one possible candidate

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
for who the designer
might be.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Well, when you say,
"Who's the designer,"

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000
if we're asking, for instance,
with the bacterial flagellum,

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000
did God specifically toggle
those DNA or those proteins,

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
I would say I don't know.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
It's a possibility.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
I certainly find it, you know,
convenient to think

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
that God is the designer,
and certainly

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
He has to be considered
a major candidate

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
if you're a theist,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000
but other people
might have other ideas.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
(narrator)
In December 2005,
the movement came face to face

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000
with its delicate balancing
of science and religion.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
A judgment on the Dover school
case was finally handed down.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Well, Kirsten,
this 139-page opinion

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
that was released today
reads like a searing indictment

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
of the concept
of intelligent design,

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
the Dover-area
school board,

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
and its implementation of that
intelligent design policy.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
And this is absolutely
an early Christmas present

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
for those Dover parents
who brought the lawsuit.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
(narrator)
The judge had identified
a clear religious purpose

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
behind the scientific claims
of intelligent design.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
It was an
unequivocal defeat.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Intelligent design was no more
scientific than creationism.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000
But this war on science
is far from over.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000
(Miller)
The Dover case may just be
the first in many battles

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
to follow on the issue
of intelligent design.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
But I think ultimately
the battle in this country

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
is not going to be won or lost
in the courtroom.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000
It's going to be won or lost
in the hearts and minds

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
of the American people
in how they regard science.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
We could lose
our scientific soul

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
and cease being a country
that is hospitable,

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
warm, welcoming,
and nurturing to science.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
And losing that, I think,
would be a great tragedy.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000
(Dawkins)
Evolution has a massive amount
of evidence in its favor,

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
and it explains, let's say,
99% of what we know about life.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000
The remaining 1%
remains to be discovered.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Intelligent design
explains precisely zero.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000
(Attenborough)
We would be wrong to suppose
that evolution

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
is the ultimate answer
to everything.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000
But nonetheless,

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
nobody has yet demonstrated
there's a failing.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
If you find something
you don't understand,

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000
of course you can say,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
"Well, it was created
by a divine spirit,"

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
but that, of course,
answers nothing, really.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
That simply says
we don't know.
