00:00:00.000 --> 00:02:06.470


2
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.230
As I remember, Adam,

3
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.700
it was upon this fashionbequeathed me by will

4
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.670
but poor 1,000 crowns

5
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.170
and, as thou sayest,

6
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.830
charged my brother on hisblessing

7
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.930
to breed me well:

8
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.600
and there begins mysadness.

9
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.370
My brother Jaques he keepsat school,

10
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.100
and report speaks goldenlyof his profit.

11
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.670
For my part, he keeps merustically at home,

12
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.270
or, to speak moreproperly, stays me here athome unkept;

13
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.730
for call you that keepingfor a gentleman of mybirth

14
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.370
that differs not from thestalling of an ox?

15
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.030
Oh, his horses are bredbetter,

16
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.400
for besides that they arefair with their feeding,

17
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.770
they are taught theirmanage

18
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.530
and to that end ridersdearly hired.

19
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.070
But I his brother gainnothing under him butgrowth,

20
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.170
for the which his animalson his dunghills

21
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.770
are as much bound to himas I.

22
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.600
Besides this nothing thathe so plentifully givesme,

23
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.200
the something that naturegave me

24
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.170
his countenance seems totake from me.

25
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.770
He lets me feed with hishinds, bars me the placeof a brother,

26
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.300
and as much as in him lies

27
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.230
mines my gentility with myeducation.

28
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.030
This is it, Adam, thatgrieves me;

29
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.900
and the spirit of myfather, which I think iswithin me,

30
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.470
begins to mutiny againstthis servitude.

31
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.200
I will no longer endureit,

32
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.800
though yet, I know no wiseremedy how to avoid it.

33
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.430
Yonder comes my master,your brother.

34
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.700
Now, sir, what make youhere?

35
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.870
Nothing.

36
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.430
I am not taught to makeanything.

37
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.000
What mar you then, sir?

38
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.100
Marry, sir, I am helpingyou to mar that which Godmade,

39
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.100
a poor unworthy brother ofyours with idleness.

40
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.600
Marry, sir, be betteremployed, and be naughtawhile.

41
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.730
Shall I keep your hogs andeat husks with them?

42
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.400
What prodigal portion haveI spent

43
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.000
that I should come to suchpenury?

44
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.770
Know you where your are,sir?

45
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.400
O, sir, very well: here inyour orchard.

46
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.230
Know you before whom, sir?

47
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.170
Aye, better than him I ambefore knows me.

48
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.930
I know that you are myeldest brother;

49
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.900
and in the gentlecondition of blood, youshould so know me.

50
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.030
The courtesy of nationsallows you my better,

51
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.500
in that you are thefirst-born;

52
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.700
but the same traditiontakes not away my blood

53
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.470
were there 20 brothersbetwixt us.

54
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.230
I have as much of myfather in me as you,

55
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.370
albeit, I confess, yourcoming before me is nearerto his reverence.

56
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.730
What, boy.

57
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.600
Come, come, elder brother,you are too young in this.

58
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.300
Wilt thou lay hands on me,villain?

59
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.570
I am no villain.

60
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.600
I am the youngest son ofSir Rowland de Boys.

61
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.000
He was my father,

62
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.200
and he is thrice a villain

63
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.070
that says such a fatherbegot villains.

64
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.100
Wert thou not my brother,I would not take this handfrom thy throat

65
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.870
till this other hand hadpulled out thy tongue forsaying so.

66
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.270
Thou hast railed onthyself.

67
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.570
Sweet masters, be patient.

68
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.170
For your father'sremembrance, be at accord.

69
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.500
Let me go, I say!

70
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.630
I shall not till I please.

71
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.870
You shall hear me.

72
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.870
Ah!

73
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.270
My father charged you inhis will to give me goodeducation.

74
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.930
You have trained me like apeasant,

75
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.100
obscuring and hiding fromme all gentleman-likequalities.

76
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.100
The spirit of my fathergrows strong in me,

77
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.500
and I will no longerendure it!

78
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.530
Therefore,

79
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.200
allow me such exercises asmay become a gentleman,

80
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.270
or give me the poorallottery my father leftme by testament.

81
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.000
With that, I will go buymy fortunes.

82
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.270
And what wilt thou do?

83
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.600
Beg when that is spent?

84
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.900
Well, sir, get you in.

85
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.230
I will not long betroubled with you.

86
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.030
You shall have some partof your will.

87
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.100
I pray you, leave me.

88
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.900
I shall no further offendyou than becomes me for mygood.

89
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.430
Get you with him, you olddog.

90
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.970
Is "old dog" my reward?

91
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.330
Most true, I have lost myteeth in your service.

92
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.170
God be with my old master.

93
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.830
He would not have spokesuch a word.

94
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.900
Is it e'en so?

95
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.400
Begin you to grow upon me?

96
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.870
I will physic yourrankness,

97
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.730
and yet give no thousandcrowns neither.

98
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.370
Holla, Dennis!

99
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.700
Calls your worship?

100
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.230
Was not Charles, theduke's wrestler, here tospeak with me?

101
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.500
So please you,

102
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.830
he is here at the door andimportunes access to you.

103
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.170
Call him in.

104
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.770
'Twill be a good way, fortomorrow the wrestling is.

105
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.970
Good morrow to yourworship.

106
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.000
Good Monsieur Charles,

107
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.530
what's the new news at thenew court?

108
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.900
There's no news at thecourt, sir, but the oldnews.

109
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.730
That is, the old duke hasbeen banished

110
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.470
by his younger brother thenew duke,

111
00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:56.870
and three or four lovinglords

112
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.300
have put themselves intovoluntary exile with him,

113
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.700
whose lands and revenuesenrich the new duke.

114
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.900
Therefore, he gives themgood leave to wander.

115
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.100
Can you tell if Rosalind,the duke's daughter,

116
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.470
be banished with herfather?

117
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.230
Oh, no, for the duke'sdaughter, her cousin, soloves her,

118
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.570
being ever from theircradles bred together,

119
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.030
that she would havefollowed her exile or havedied to stay behind her.

120
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.300
She is at the court

121
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.800
and no less beloved of heruncle than his owndaughter,

122
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.770
and never two ladies lovedas they do.

123
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.770
Where will the old dukelive?

124
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.800
They say he is already atthe forest of Arden

125
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.670
and a many merry men withhim,

126
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.330
and there they live likethe old Robin Hood ofEngland.

127
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.730
They say many younggentlemen flock to himevery day

128
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.530
and fleet the timecarelessly as they did inthe golden world.

129
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.630
What, you wrestle tomorrowbefore the new duke?

130
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.770
Marry, do I, sir,

131
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.000
and I came to acquaint youwith a matter.

132
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.570
I am given, sir, secretly,to understand

133
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.230
that your younger brotherOrlando

134
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.430
hath a disposition to comein disguised against me totry a fall.

135
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.900
Tomorrow, sir, I wrestlefor my credit;

136
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.230
and he that escapes mewithout some broken limb

137
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.400
shall acquit him well.

138
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.000
Your brother is but youngand tender;

139
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.570
and, for your love, Iwould be loath to foil him

140
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.970
which I must for my ownhonour if he come in.

141
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.500
Therefore, out of my loveto you, I came hither toacquaint you withal

142
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.030
that either you might stayhim from his intendment

143
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.730
or brook such disgracewell as he shall run into,

144
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.870
in that it is a thing ofhis own search

145
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.030
and altogether againstmy will.

146
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.700
Charles, I thank thee forthy love to me,

147
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.500
which thou shalt find Iwill most kindly requite.

148
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.170
I had myself notice of mybrother's purpose herein

149
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:38.600
and have by underhandmeans laboured to dissuadehim from it,

150
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.730
but he is resolute.

151
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.570
And thou wert best lookto't,

152
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.730
for if thou dost him anyslight disgrace,

153
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.400
or if he do not mightilygrace himself on thee,

154
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.800
he will practise againstthee by poison,

155
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.370
entrap thee by sometreacherous device

156
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.300
and never leave thee tillhe hath ta'en thy life

157
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.630
by some indirect means orother;

158
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.270
for, I assure thee--

159
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.870
and almost with tears Ispeak it--

160
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.270
there is not one so youngand so villainous

161
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.570
this day living.

162
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:17.170
I am heartily glad I camehither to you.

163
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.000
If he come tomorrow, I'llgive him his payment.

164
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.800
And so, God keep yourworship.

165
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.670
Farewell, good Charles.

166
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.070
Now will I stir thisgamester:

167
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.370
I hope I shall see an endof him,

168
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.970
for my soul, yet I knownot why, hates nothingmore than he.

169
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.770
Yet he's gentle, neverschooled yet learned,

170
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:49.400
full of noble device, allsorts enchantinglybeloved--

171
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.370
indeed, so much in theheart of the world

172
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.130
and especially of mine ownpeople, who best know him,

173
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.070
that I am altogethermisprized.

174
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.670
But it shall not be solong.

175
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.030
This wrestler shall clearall.

176
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.170
Nothing remains but that Ikindle the boy hither,

177
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.100
which now I'll go about.

178
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.130
Oh.

179
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.970
I pray thee, Rosalind,sweet my coz, be merry.

180
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.030
Dear Celia, I show moremirth than I am mistressof,

181
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.800
and would you yet I weremerrier?

182
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.330
Unless you could teach meto forget a banishedfather,

183
00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:03.600
you must not learn me toremember any extraordinarypleasure.

184
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:09.830
Herein, I see thou lovestme not with the fullweight that I love thee.

185
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.930
If my uncle, thy banishedfather,

186
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.530
had banished thy uncle,the duke my father,

187
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.200
so thou hadst still beenwith me,

188
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.530
I could have taught mylove to take thy fatherfor mine.

189
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.930
So wouldst thou if thetruth of thy love to me

190
00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.170
were so righteouslytempered as mine is tothee.

191
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.530
Well, I will forget thecondition of my estate

192
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.530
to rejoice in yours.

193
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.500
You know my father hath nochild but I,

194
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.070
nor none is like to have;

195
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.570
and truly, when he dies,thou shalt be his heir,

196
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.370
for what he hath takenaway from thy fatherperforce,

197
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.500
I will render thee againin affection.

198
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.900
By mine honour, I will,

199
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:57.930
and when I break thatoath, let me turn monster.

200
00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.470
Therefore, my sweet Rose,

201
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.300
my dear Rose...

202
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.770
be merry.

203
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.870
From henceforth, I will,coz,

204
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.830
and devise sports.

205
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.100
Ah.

206
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.230
Let me see.

207
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:20.230
What think you of fallingin love?

208
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:25.700
Marry, I prithee, do, tomake sport withal,

209
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.800
ah, but love no man ingood earnest

210
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.200
nor no further in sportneither

211
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.000
than with the safety of apure blush

212
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.270
thou mayst in honour comeoff again.

213
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.300
What shall be our sport,then?

214
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.870
Let us sit and mock

215
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.230
the good housewife Fortunefrom her wheel

216
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.170
that her gifts henceforthmay be bestowed equally.

217
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.570
I would we could do so,

218
00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.670
for her benefits aremightily misplaced,

219
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.330
and the bountiful blindwoman doth most mistake

220
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:53.630
in her gifts to women.

221
00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:54.930
'Tis true,

222
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.130
for those she makes fair,she scarce makes honest,

223
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.230
and those she makeshonest, she makes veryill-favoredly.

224
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:06.530
Nay, now thou goest fromFortune's office toNature's.

225
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.530
Fortune reigns in thegifts of the world,

226
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.300
not in the lineaments ofNature.

227
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.070
No?

228
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.400
How now, wit!

229
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.000
Whither wander you?

230
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.270
Mistress, you must comeaway to your father.

231
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.930
Were you made themessenger?

232
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.670
No, by mine honour, but Iwas bid to come for you.

233
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.330
Where learned you thatoath, fool?

234
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.530
Of a certain knight

235
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.800
that swore by his honourthey were good pancakes

236
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.000
and swore by his honourthe mustard was naught.

237
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.300
Now I'll stand to it.

238
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.700
The pancakes were naught,and the mustard was good,

239
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.430
and yet was not the knightforsworn.

240
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:36.730
How prove you that

241
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.800
in the great heap of yourknowledge?

242
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.630
Aye, marry, now unmuzzleyour wisdom.

243
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.100
Stand you both forth now.

244
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.470
Oh.

245
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.030
Stroke your chins,

246
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.000
and swear by your beardsthat I am a knave.

247
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.530
By our beards, if we hadthem, thou art.

248
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.600
By my knavery, if I hadit, then I were;

249
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.230
but if you swear by thatthat is not,

250
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.500
you are not forsworn.

251
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.530
No more was this knightswearing by his honour,

252
00:13:58.530 --> 00:13:59.770
for he never had any;

253
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.470
or if he had, he had swornit away

254
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.430
before ever he saw thosepancakes or that mustard.

255
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.700
Prithee, who is't thatthou meanest?

256
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.170
One that old Frederick,your father, loves.

257
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.100
My father's love is enoughto honour him.

258
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.470
Enough; speak no more ofhim.

259
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.770
You'll be whipped fortaxation, one of thesedays.

260
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.130
The more pity that foolsmay not speak wisely

261
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.770
what wise men dofoolishly.

262
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.230
By my troth, thou sayesttrue,

263
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.230
for since the little witthat fools have wassilenced,

264
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:28.530
the little foolery thatwise men have

265
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.900
makes a great show.

266
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.800
Ah, here comes Monsieur LeBeau.

267
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.100
With his mouth full ofnews.

268
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.030
Which he will put on us aspigeons feed their young.

269
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.500
Then shall we benews-crammed.

270
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.700
All the better.

271
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.270
We shall be the moremarketable.

272
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.870
Bon jour, Monsieur LeBeau.

273
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.030
What is the news?

274
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.170
Fair princess, you havelost much good sport.

275
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.500
Sport!

276
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.870
Of what color?

277
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.070
What color, madam?

278
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.170
How shall I answer you?

279
00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.300
As wit and fortune will.

280
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.600
Or as the Destiniesdecree.

281
00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.730
Well said.

282
00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.130
That was laid on with atrowel.

283
00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.030
You amaze me, ladies.

284
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.930
I would have told you ofgood wrestling

285
00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.530
which you have lost thesight of.

286
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.570
Yet tell us the manner ofthe wrestling.

287
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.270
I will tell you thebeginning,

288
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.030
and if it please yourladyships, you may see theend;

289
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:17.470
for the best is yet to do.

290
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.700
Well, the beginning, thatis dead and buried.

291
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.630
There comes an old man andhis three sons.

292
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.770
I could match thisbeginning with an oldtale.

293
00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.730
Three proper young men ofexcellent growth andpresence.

294
00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.870
The eldest of the threewrestled with Charles, theduke's wrestler,

295
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:31.230
which Charles, in amoment,

296
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.970
threw him and broke threeof his ribs

297
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.130
that there is little hopeof life in him.

298
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:37.630
So he served the secondand so the third.

299
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.230
Yonder they lie,

300
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.730
the poor old man, theirfather, making suchpitiful dole over them

301
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.200
that all the beholderstake his part withweeping.

302
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.900
Alas.

303
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.600
But what is the sport,monsieur, that the ladieshave lost?

304
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.970
Why, this that I speak of.

305
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.900
Thus men may grow wiserevery day.

306
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.630
It is the first time thatever I heard

307
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.500
breaking of ribs was sportfor ladies.

308
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.900
Or I, I promise thee.

309
00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.030
But is there any else

310
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.430
longs to see this brokenmusic in his sides?

311
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:05.470
Is there yet another dotesupon rib breaking?

312
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.230
Shall we see thiswrestling, cousin?

313
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.630
They are ready to performit.

314
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.700
Come on.

315
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.530
Since the youth will notbe entreated,

316
00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:28.330
his own peril on hisforwardness.

317
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:34.970
Is yonder the man?

318
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:36.200
Even he, madam.

319
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.900
Alas, he is too young,

320
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.330
and yet he lookssuccessfully.

321
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.830
How now, daughter andcousin.

322
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:45.270
Are you crept hither tosee the wrestling?

323
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.230
Aye, my liege, so pleaseyou give us leave.

324
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:48.900
You will take littledelight in it,

325
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.000
I can tell you.

326
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.370
There is such odds in theman.

327
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.670
In pity of thechallenger's youth, Iwould fain dissuade him,

328
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.070
but he will not beentreated.

329
00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.230
Speak to him, ladies.

330
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.130
See if you can move him.

331
00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.100
Call him hither, goodMonsieur Le Beau.

332
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.670
Do so; I'll not be by.

333
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:07.030
Monsieur the challenger,the princess calls foryou.

334
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.300
I attend them with allrespect and duty.

335
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.770
Young sir, have youchallenged Charles thewrestler?

336
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.070
No, fair princess.

337
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:20.470
He is the generalchallenger.

338
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:21.770
I come but in as others do

339
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.630
to try with him thestrength of my youth.

340
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.270
Young gentleman,

341
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.900
your spirits are too boldfor your years.

342
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.200
You have seen cruel proofof this man's strength.

343
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.630
If you saw yourself withyour eyes

344
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.170
or knew yourself with yourjudgment,

345
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:39.600
the fear of this adventure

346
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.170
would counsel you to amore equal enterprise.

347
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:47.370
We pray you, for your ownsake,

348
00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:51.270
to embrace your own safetyand give over thisattempt.

349
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.900
Do, young sir.

350
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.700
Your reputation shall nottherefore be misprized.

351
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.370
We shall make it our suitto the duke

352
00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.200
that the wrestling may notgo forward.

353
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.400
I beseech you, punish menot with your hardthoughts,

354
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.330
wherein I confess me muchguilty

355
00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.230
to deny so fair andexcellent ladies anything,

356
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.900
but let your fair eyes andgentle wishes

357
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.030
go with me to my trial,

358
00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.800
wherein if I be foiled,

359
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.070
there is but one shamedthat was never gracious;

360
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:19.500
if killed, but one deadthat was willing to be so.

361
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.730
I shall do my friends nowrong, for I have none tolament me;

362
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.630
the world no injury, forin it I have nothing;

363
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.270
only in the world I fillup a place

364
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:32.630
which may be bettersupplied when I have madeit empty.

365
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:37.130
The little strength Ihave, I would it were withyou.

366
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.670
And mine to eke out hers.

367
00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.870
Fare you well.

368
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.300
Pray heaven I be deceivedin you.

369
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.330
Your heart's desires bewith you.

370
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.270
Come, where is this younggallant

371
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.700
that is so desirous to liewith his mother earth?

372
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.670
Ready, sir,

373
00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.830
but his will hath in it amore modest working.

374
00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.170
You shall try but onefall.

375
00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.630
No, I warrant, your grace,

376
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.400
you shall not entreat himto a second

377
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.700
that have so mightilypersuaded him from afirst.

378
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.930
You mean to mock me after.

379
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.600
You should not have mockedme before.

380
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.070
But come your ways.

381
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:18.370
Now Hercules be thy speed,young man!

382
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.730
I would I were invisible,

383
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.100
to catch the strong fellowby the leg.

384
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.300
Hold.

385
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.270
O excellent, young man!

386
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.900
If I had a thunderbolt inmine eye,

387
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.600
I can tell who shoulddown.

388
00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.130
No more. No more.

389
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.030
Yes, I beseech your grace.

390
00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.600
I am not yet wellbreathed.

391
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.030
How dost thou, Charles?

392
00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:11.100
He cannot speak, my lord.

393
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.070
Bear him away.

394
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:16.670
What is thy name, youngman?

395
00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.070
Orlando, my liege,

396
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.130
the youngest son of SirRowland de Boys.

397
00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.570
I would thou hadst beenson to some man else.

398
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:29.200
The world esteem'd thyfather honourable,

399
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.270
but I did find him stillmine enemy.

400
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.700
Thou shouldst have betterpleased me with this deed

401
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.130
hadst thou descended fromanother house,

402
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:37.470
now fare thee well.

403
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.770
Thou art a gallant youth.

404
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.870
I would thou hadst told meof another father.

405
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.000
Were I my father, coz,would I do this?

406
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.900
I am more proud to be SirRowland's son,

407
00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.330
his youngest son,

408
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.030
and would not change thatcalling to be adopted heirto Frederick.

409
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.670
My father loved SirRowland as his soul,

410
00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.800
and all the world was ofmy father's mind.

411
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.300
Had I before known thisyoung man his son,

412
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.530
I should have given himtears unto entreaties

413
00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.130
ere he should thus haveventured.

414
00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.630
Gentle cousin,

415
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:10.430
let us go thank him andencourage him.

416
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.470
My father's rough andenvious disposition

417
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:14.170
sticks me at heart.

418
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:24.070
Sir...

419
00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.600
you have well deserved.

420
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.530
If you do keep yourpromises in love

421
00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.830
but justly as you haveexceeded all promise,

422
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.030
your mistress shall behappy.

423
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.100
Gentleman, wear this forme...

424
00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:57.670
one out of suits withfortune,

425
00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.930
that would give more butthat her hand lacks means.

426
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.030
Shall we go, coz?

427
00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.730
Aye.

428
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.730
Fare you well, fairgentleman.

429
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.770
Can I not say I thank you?

430
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.600
My better parts are allthrown down,

431
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.900
and that which here standsup is but a quintain,

432
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.200
a mere lifeless block.

433
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.070
He calls us back.

434
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.730
My pride fell with myfortunes.

435
00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:34.130
I'll ask him what hewould.

436
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.030
Did you call, sir?

437
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.400
Sir, you have wrestledwell

438
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.330
and overthrown more thanyour enemies.

439
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Will you go, coz?

440
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.500
Have with you.

441
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.500
Fare you well.

442
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:09.070
What passion hangs theseweights upon my tongue?

443
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:12.570
I cannot speak to her, yetshe urged conference.

444
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:16.870
O poor Orlando, thou artoverthrown,

445
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:22.570
or Charles or somethingweaker masters thee.

446
00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:23.600
Good sir...

447
00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:27.270
I do in friendship counselyou to leave this place.

448
00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.400
Albeit you have deservedhigh commendation,

449
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.670
true applause, and love,

450
00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:32.400
yet such is now the duke'scondition

451
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.470
that he misconstrues allthat you have done.

452
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:35.830
The duke is humorous.

453
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:39.230
What he is indeed moresuits you to conceive thanI to speak of.

454
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.300
I thank you, sir, and prayyou, tell me this:

455
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.170
which of the two wasdaughter of the duke

456
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:44.630
that here was at thewrestling?

457
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.730
Neither his daughter if wejudge by manners,

458
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.800
and yet indeed, thesmaller is his daughter.

459
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.770
The other is daughter tothe banish'd duke

460
00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.930
and here detain'd by herusurping uncle to keep hisdaughter company,

461
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.530
whose loves are dearerthan the natural bond ofsisters;

462
00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:57.900
but I can tell you that oflate

463
00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.670
this duke hath ta'endispleasure 'gainst hisgentle niece

464
00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:02.170
grounded upon no otherargument

465
00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.300
but that the people praiseher for her virtues

466
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.170
and pity her for her goodfather's sake;

467
00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:07.370
and on my life,

468
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.970
his malice 'gainst thelady will suddenly breakforth.

469
00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:11.070
Sir, fare you well.

470
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.930
Hereafter, in a betterworld than this,

471
00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.070
I shall desire more loveand knowledge of you.

472
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:18.730
I rest much bounden toyou; fare you well.

473
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.400
Thus must I from the smokeinto the smother,

474
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:26.670
from tyrant duke unto atyrant brother,

475
00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:32.330
but heavenly Rosalind--

476
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.470
Why, cousin!

477
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.100
Why, Rosalind!

478
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:52.130
Cupid have mercy, not aword?

479
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:53.630
Not one to throw at a dog.

480
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.570
Perth, no, thy words aretoo precious

481
00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:59.100
to be cast away upon curs.

482
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.330
Throw some of them at me.

483
00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:02.500
Come, lame me withreasons.

484
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.530
Then there were twocousins laid up

485
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.470
when the one should belamed with reasons

486
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.230
and the other mad withoutany.

487
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.470
But is all this for thyfather?

488
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:15.300
No, some of it is for mychild's father.

489
00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.200
Ah.

490
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:23.100
O, how full of briers isthis working-day world!

491
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.130
They are but burs, cousin,

492
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.630
thrown upon thee inholiday foolery.

493
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:30.270
If we walk not in thetrodden paths,

494
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.130
our very petticoats willcatch them.

495
00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:33.770
I could throw them off mycoat.

496
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:36.100
These burs are in myheart.

497
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.370
Ahem-- hem them away.

498
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:38.830
I would try,

499
00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:42.030
if I could cry "hem" andhave him.

500
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.930
Come, come, wrestle withthy affections.

501
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:48.800
O, they take the part of abetter wrestler thanmyself.

502
00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.730
O, a good wish upon you,

503
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:55.000
and you shall try in timein despite of a fall;

504
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.630
but turning these jestsout of service,

505
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.130
let us talk in goodearnest.

506
00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.800
Is it possible on sucha sudden

507
00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.370
that you should fall intoso strong a liking

508
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.130
with old Sir Rowland'syoungest son?

509
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:10.200
The duke my father lovedhis father dearly.

510
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.600
But does it thereforeensue that you should lovehis son dearly?

511
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.630
By this kind of chase, Ishould hate him,

512
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.070
for my father hated hisfather dearly.

513
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.470
Yet, I hate not Orlando.

514
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.300
No, faith, hate him not,for my sake.

515
00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.830
Why should I not?

516
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:26.000
Does he not deserve well?

517
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.370
Let me love him for that.

518
00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:28.700
Do you love him because Ido.

519
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.930
Mistress,

520
00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.270
dispatch you with yoursafest haste,

521
00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.670
and get you from ourcourt.

522
00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:53.770
Me, uncle?

523
00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:55.230
You, cousin.

524
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:57.700
Within these 10 days,

525
00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.070
if that thou be'st found

526
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:02.330
so near our public courtas 20 miles,

527
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.130
thou diest for it.

528
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:05.530
I do beseech your grace,

529
00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:07.600
let me the knowledge of myfaultbear with me.

530
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.870
If with myself I holdintelligence

531
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:15.830
or have acquaintance ofmine own desires,

532
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.200
if that I do not dream orbe not frantic--

533
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.070
as I do trust I am not--

534
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:23.400
then, dear uncle, never somuch as in a thoughtunborn

535
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.830
did I offend yourhighness.

536
00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.330
Thus do all traitors.

537
00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:30.530
If their purgation didconsist in words,

538
00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:33.300
they are as innocent asgrace itself.

539
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.170
Let it suffice thee that Itrust thee not.

540
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.900
Yet your mistrust cannotmake me a traitor.

541
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.000
Tell me whereon thelikelihood depends.

542
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.070
Thou art thy father'sdaughter;there's enough.

543
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:49.070
So was I when yourhighness took his dukedom.

544
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.470
So was I when yourhighness banish'd him.

545
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.230
Treason is not inherited,my lord;

546
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:55.230
or if we did derive itfrom our friends,

547
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.430
what's that to me?

548
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.400
My father was no traitor.

549
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.930
Then, good my liege,

550
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.170
mistake me not so much tothink my poverty istreacherous.

551
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.330
Dear sovereign, hear mespeak.

552
00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:13.000
Aye, Celia; we stay'd herfor your sake,

553
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.170
else had she with herfather ranged along.

554
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.930
I did not then entreat tohave her stay.

555
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:22.370
It was your pleasure andyour own remorse.

556
00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:24.730
I was too young that timeto value her,

557
00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:26.470
but now I know her.

558
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:29.830
If she be a traitor, why,then so am I,

559
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:33.400
for still, we slepttogether, rose in aninstant,

560
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.300
learn'd, play'd, eattogether;

561
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.700
and wheresoever we went,like Juno's swans,

562
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:42.970
still we went coupled andinseparable.

563
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:48.530
She is too subtle forthee;

564
00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:51.700
and her smoothness, hervery silence,

565
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.470
and her patience speak tothe people;

566
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:54.670
and they pity her.

567
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:55.900
Thou art a fool.

568
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.930
She robs thee of thy name,

569
00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:01.230
and thou wilt show morebright and seem morevirtuous

570
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:02.430
when she is gone.

571
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:04.130
Open not thy lips!

572
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:06.900
Firm and irrevocable is mydoom which I have pass'dupon her.

573
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.100
She is banish'd.

574
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.670
Pronounce that sentencethen on me, my liege.

575
00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:12.500
I cannot live out of hercompany.

576
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.700
You are a fool.

577
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.170
You, niece, provideyourself.

578
00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.370
If you outstay the time,

579
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.900
upon mine honour and inthe greatness of my word,

580
00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.600
you die.

581
00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.370
O my poor Rosalind...

582
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.330
whither wilt thou go?

583
00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:49.670
Wilt thou change fathers?

584
00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.070
I will give thee mine.

585
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:52.270
Oh, I charge thee,

586
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:54.070
be thou not more grievedthan I am.

587
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.930
I have more cause.

588
00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:58.770
Thou hast not, cousin.

589
00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.230
Prithee, be cheerful.

590
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:02.370
Know'st thou not,

591
00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:06.930
the duke hath banish'd me,his daughter?

592
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:08.330
That he hath not.

593
00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:11.030
No, hath not?

594
00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:13.630
Rosalind lacks then thelove which teaches thee

595
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.500
that thou and I am one.

596
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.970
Therefore, devise with mehow we may fly,

597
00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:24.600
whither to go and what tobear with us;

598
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.470
and do not seek to takeyour charge upon you,

599
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:32.730
to bear your griefsyourself and leave me out,

600
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.530
for by this heaven,now atour sorrows pale,

601
00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.430
say what thou canst; I'llgo along with thee.

602
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:41.470
Why, whither shall we go?

603
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:46.900
To seek my uncle in theforest of Arden.

604
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.330
Alas, what danger will itbe to us,

605
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:53.500
maids as we are, to travelforth so far?

606
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:57.130
Beauty provoketh thievessooner than gold.

607
00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:01.270
I'll put myself in poorand mean attire

608
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.630
and with a kind of umbersmirch my face;

609
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:04.900
the like will you.

610
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.670
So shall we pass along andnever stir assailants.

611
00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:10.330
Would it not be better,

612
00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:13.530
because that I am morethan common tall,

613
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:18.300
that I should suit me allpoints like a man?

614
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:22.670
A gallant curtle-axe uponmy thigh,

615
00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:24.600
a boar spear in my hand;

616
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.170
and in my heart lie there

617
00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:28.600
what hidden woman's fearthere will.

618
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.300
We'll have a swashing anda martial outside

619
00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.500
as many other mannishcowards have

620
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.930
that do outface it withtheir semblances.

621
00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:40.670
What shall I call theewhen thou art a man?

622
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:43.830
I'll have no worse a namethan Jove's own page,

623
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:47.100
and look you therefore,call me Ganymede,

624
00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.870
but what will you becall'd?

625
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:53.070
Something that hath areference to my state.

626
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:56.530
No longer Celia, butAliena.

627
00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.630
Oh, shh.

628
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:04.800
But, cousin,

629
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.300
what if we assay'd tosteal the clownish fool

630
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.000
out of your father'scourt?

631
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.470
Would he not be a comfortto our travels?

632
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:14.500
He'll go o'er the wideworld with me.

633
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.000
Leave me alone to woo him.

634
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.330
Let's away and get ourjewels and our wealthtogether,

635
00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:24.470
devise the fittest timeand safest way to hide usfrom pursuit

636
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:27.470
that will be made after myflight.

637
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:30.800
Now go we in content

638
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.270
to liberty and not tobanishment.

639
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:09.270
Now, my co-mates andbrothers in exile,

640
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:13.700
hath not old custom madethis life more sweet

641
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.300
than that of painted pomp?

642
00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.500
Are not these woods morefree from peril

643
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.200
than the envious court?

644
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.330
Here feel we but thepenalty of Adam,

645
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:24.730
the seasons' difference,

646
00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:29.000
as the icy fang andchurlish chiding of thewinter's wind,

647
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.030
which, when it bites andblows upon my body,

648
00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:33.230
even till I shrink withcold,

649
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:37.730
I smile and say, "This isno flattery.

650
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:39.000
"These are counsellors

651
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.430
that feelingly persuade mewhat I am."

652
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:45.730
Sweet are the uses ofadversity,

653
00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:49.200
which, like the toad, uglyand venomous,

654
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:53.270
wears yet a precious jewelin his head,

655
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.730
and this our life exemptfrom public haunt

656
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:59.070
finds tongues in trees,

657
00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:02.200
books in the runningbrooks,

658
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.370
sermons in stones,

659
00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:08.430
and good in every thing.

660
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:10.630
I would not change it.

661
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:11.870
Happy is your Grace

662
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:14.130
that can translate thestubbornness of fortune

663
00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:17.300
into so quiet and so sweeta style.

664
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.570
Come, shall we go and killus venison?

665
00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:25.470
And yet it irks me thepoor dappled fools,

666
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:29.300
being native burghers ofthis desert city,

667
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.530
should in their ownconfines with the forkedheads

668
00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.070
have their round haunchesgored.

669
00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:36.330
Indeed, my lord,

670
00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:38.200
the melancholy Jaquesgrieves at that,

671
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.530
and in that kind

672
00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:40.670
swears you do more usurp

673
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:42.870
than doth your brotherthat hath banish'd you.

674
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:45.300
Today, my Lord of Amiensand myself

675
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.230
did steal behind him as helay along

676
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:49.170
under an oak whose antiqueroot peeps out

677
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:51.400
upon the brook that brawlsalong this wood,

678
00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.000
to the which place a poorsequester'd stag

679
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.970
that from the hunter's aimhad ta'en a hurt

680
00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:57.400
did come to languish,

681
00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.670
and indeed, my lord,

682
00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.900
the wretched animal heavedforth such groans

683
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.630
that their discharge didstretch his leathern coatalmost to bursting,

684
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.270
and the big round tears

685
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:08.370
coursed one another downhis innocent nose

686
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:09.600
in piteous chase;

687
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.500
and thus, the hairy fool

688
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.930
much marked of themelancholy Jaques,

689
00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:16.400
stood on the extremestverge of the swift brook,

690
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.770
augmenting it with tears.

691
00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:19.030
But what said Jaques?

692
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:21.330
Did he not moralize thisspectacle?

693
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:24.100
O, yes, into a thousandsimiles:

694
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.070
first, for his weepinginto the needless stream,

695
00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:28.670
"Poor deer," quoth he,

696
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:31.070
"thou makest a testamentas worldlings do,

697
00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:34.200
giving thy sum of more tothat which had too much";

698
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.030
then, being there alone,

699
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:38.870
left and abandon'd of hisvelvet friends,

700
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:40.230
"'Tis right," quoth he,

701
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:42.730
"thus misery doth part theflux of company"

702
00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:45.470
anon a careless herd fullof the pasture,

703
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:47.700
jumps along by him andnever stays to greet him;

704
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:52.330
"Aye," quoth Jaques,"Sweep on, you fat andgreasy citizens;

705
00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:53.570
"'tis just the fashion.

706
00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:54.670
"Wherefore do you look

707
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:57.430
upon that poor and brokenbankrupt there?"

708
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:59.270
Thus most invectively,

709
00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:02.900
he pierceth through thebody of the country, city,court,

710
00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.700
yea, and of this, ourlife,

711
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.830
swearing that we are mereusurpers, tyrants,

712
00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.100
and what's worse,

713
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.000
to fright the animals andto kill them up

714
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.030
in their assign'd andnative dwelling place.

715
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.600
And did you leave him inthis contemplation?

716
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.800
We did, my lord,

717
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.030
weeping and commentingupon the sobbing deer.

718
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.600
Show me the place.

719
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.770
I love to cope him inthese sullen fits,

720
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:24.600
for then he's full ofmatter.

721
00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:37.600
Can it be possible that noman saw them?

722
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.000
It cannot be.

723
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.730
Some villains of my court

724
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:43.230
are of consent andsufferance in this.

725
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:44.970
I cannot hear of any thatdid see her.

726
00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:47.570
The ladies, her attendantsof her chamber, saw herabed,

727
00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:48.830
and in the morning early,

728
00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:51.170
they found the beduntreasured of theirmistress.

729
00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:52.470
My lord, the roynishclown,

730
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.500
at whom so oft your gracewas wont to laugh,

731
00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.730
is also missing.

732
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:57.600
Hisperia, the princess'gentlewoman,

733
00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.470
confesses that shesecretly o'erheard

734
00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:00.900
your daughter and hercousin

735
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.200
much commend the parts andgraces of the wrestler

736
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.570
that did but lately foilthe sinewy Charles;

737
00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:07.530
and she believes, whereverthey are gone,

738
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:10.900
that youth is surely intheir company.

739
00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.400
Send to his brother.

740
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.770
Fetch that gallant hither.

741
00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.700
I'll make him find him.

742
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.670
Do this expediently!

743
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:22.330
And let not search andinquisition

744
00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:27.070
quail to bring again thesefoolish runaways.

745
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.170
Who's there?

746
00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:40.570
What? My young master?

747
00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:42.300
O, my gentle master,

748
00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.700
your praise is come tooswiftly home before you.

749
00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.900
Know you not, master, tosome kind of men

750
00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.870
their graces serve thembut as enemies?

751
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:50.000
No more do yours.

752
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.700
Your virtues, gentlemaster,

753
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.500
are sanctified and holytraitors to you.

754
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:55.930
O, what a world is this

755
00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:58.800
when what is comelyenvenoms him that bearsit?

756
00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.330
Why, what's the matter?

757
00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:03.330
O unhappy youth, come notwithin these doors.

758
00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:05.800
Within this roof, theenemy of all your graceslives.

759
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.670
Your brother--no, nobrother-- yet the son--yetnot the son--

760
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:11.370
I will not call him son ofhim I was about to callhis father--

761
00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:12.570
hath heard your praises,

762
00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:13.830
and this night,

763
00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:16.030
he means to burn thelodging where you use tolie

764
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:17.200
and you within it.

765
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.330
If he fail in that,

766
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:19.930
he hath other means to cutyou off.

767
00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:21.630
I overheard him and hispractises.

768
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:23.030
This is no place.

769
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:24.600
This house is but abutchery.

770
00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.830
Abhor it; fear it; do notenter it.

771
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:28.900
Why, whither, Adam,wouldst thou have me go?

772
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.130
No matter whither so youcome not here.

773
00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:34.300
What, wouldst thou have mego and beg my food?

774
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.970
Or with a base andboisterous sword

775
00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:38.100
enforce a thievish livingon the common road?

776
00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.770
Oh, but do not so.

777
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:42.530
I have 500 crowns,

778
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.730
the thrifty hire I savedunder your father,

779
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:46.630
which I did store to be myfoster nurse

780
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.800
when service should in myold limbs lie lame

781
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.470
and unregarded age incorners thrown.

782
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:52.970
Take that,

783
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.230
and he that doth theravens feed,

784
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:58.030
yea, providently catersfor the sparrow,

785
00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:00.270
be comfort to my age.

786
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:01.470
Here is the gold.

787
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:03.770
All this I give you.

788
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:05.400
Let me be your servant.

789
00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.270
Though I look old, yet Iam strong and lusty.

790
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.170
I'll do the service of ayounger man

791
00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:12.430
in all your business andnecessities.

792
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:16.470
O good old man,

793
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:17.730
how well in thee appears

794
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:19.970
the constant service ofthe antique world,

795
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:24.200
when service sweat forduty, not for meed!

796
00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.570
But, poor old man,

797
00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:29.600
thou prunest a rotten treethat cannot so much as ablossom

798
00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.600
yield in lieu of all thypains and husbandry,

799
00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:39.100
but come thy ways.

800
00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.630
We'll go along together.

801
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:42.500
Master, go on,

802
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.630
and I will follow thee tothe last gasp

803
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:47.500
with truth and loyalty.

804
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:50.830
From 17 years till nowalmost fourscore herelived I

805
00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:53.770
but now live here no more.

806
00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:56.500
At 17 years, many theirfortunes seek,

807
00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:00.630
but at fourscore, it istoo late a week.

808
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:02.570
Yet fortune cannotrecompense me better

809
00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:06.930
than to die well and notmy master's debtor.

810
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:27.900
O Jupiter, how weary aremy spirits.

811
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:31.870
I care not for my spiritsif my legs were not weary.

812
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:35.700
I could find it in myheart to disgrace my man'sapparel

813
00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.930
and cry like a woman,

814
00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:40.370
but I must comfort theweaker vessel

815
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:41.670
as doublet and hose

816
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:44.600
ought to show itself morecourageous to petticoat.

817
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.470
Therefore courage, goodAliena!

818
00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:48.730
Pray you, bear with me.

819
00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:50.370
I cannot go no further.

820
00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:51.530
For my part,

821
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:53.900
I'd rather bear with youthan bear you,

822
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.370
yet I should bear no crossif I did bear you,

823
00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:58.330
for I think you have nomoney in your purse.

824
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:03.200
Well...

825
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.670
this is the forest ofArden.

826
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:09.830
Aye, now am I in Arden,themore fool I.

827
00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:12.700
When I was at home, I wasin a better place,

828
00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.730
but travellers must becontent.

829
00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:18.670
Aye, be so, goodTouchstone.

830
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:21.070
Look you, who comes here--

831
00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:24.200
a young man and an old insolemn talk.

832
00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:28.100
That is the way to makeher scorn you still.

833
00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:36.900
O Corin, that thou knew'sthow I do love her.

834
00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.830
I partly guess, for I haveloved ere now.

835
00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:45.870
No, Corin, being old, thoucanst not guess,

836
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:47.200
though in thy youth

837
00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.570
thou wast as true a lover

838
00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:51.330
as ever sigh'd upon amidnight pillow.

839
00:42:56.530 --> 00:43:00.230
But if your love were everlike to mine--

840
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:04.200
as sure I think did neverman love so--

841
00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.570
how many actions mostridiculous

842
00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:09.530
hast thou been drawn to bythy fantasy?

843
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:13.900
Into a thousand that Ihave forgotten.

844
00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:18.530
O, thou didst then neverlove so heartily.

845
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:21.470
If thou remember'st notthe slightest folly

846
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:23.230
that ever love did makethee run into,

847
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:26.070
thou hast not loved.

848
00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:29.270
Or if thou hast not sat asI do now,

849
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:32.330
wearying thy hearer in thymistress' praise,

850
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:36.200
thou hast not loved.

851
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.770
Or if thou hast not brokefrom company abruptly

852
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:41.370
as my passion now makesme,

853
00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:44.200
thou hast not loved.

854
00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:50.430
O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!

855
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:56.530
Alas, poor shepherd.

856
00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.100
Searching of thy wound,

857
00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:02.630
I have by hard adventurefound mine own.

858
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:04.400
And I mine.

859
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.470
I remember, when I was inlove,

860
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:09.430
I broke my sword upon astone and bid him takethat

861
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:12.400
for coming a-night to JaneSmile;

862
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:15.430
and I remember the kissingof her batlet

863
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:16.900
and the cow's dugs

864
00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.900
that her pretty chopp'dhands had milked;

865
00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.700
and I remember the wooingof a peascod instead ofher,

866
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.970
from whom I took two codsand, giving her themagain,

867
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:30.730
said with weeping tears,"Wear these for my sake."

868
00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:35.700
Ah, we that are truelovers run into strangecapers;

869
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.970
but as all is mortal innature,

870
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:41.430
so is all nature in lovemortal in folly.

871
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:43.700
Thou speakest wiser thanthou art ware of.

872
00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.600
Nay, I shall ne'er be wareof mine own wit

873
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.930
till I break my shinsagainst it.

874
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:51.270
Oh, Jove, Jove,

875
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:54.500
this shepherd's passion ismuch after my own fashion.

876
00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:55.730
And mine,

877
00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:58.800
but it grows somethingstale with me.

878
00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.270
I pray you,

879
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:02.370
one of you question yondman

880
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:05.130
if he for gold will giveus any food.

881
00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:06.630
I faint almost to death.

882
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.900
Holla, you clown!

883
00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:10.070
Peace, fool.

884
00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:11.500
He's not thy kinsman.

885
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.700
Who calls?

886
00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.200
Your betters, sir.

887
00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.930
Else are they verywretched.

888
00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:19.000
Peace, I say.

889
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.030
Good even to you, friend.

890
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:28.270
And to you, gentle sir,

891
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:29.600
and to you all.

892
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:33.730
I prithee, shepherd,

893
00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.800
if that love or gold

894
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.200
could in this desert placebuy entertainment,

895
00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.970
bring us where we may restourselves and feed.

896
00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:45.670
Here's a maid with travelmuch oppress'd

897
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:47.670
and almost faints forsuccor.

898
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:48.970
Fair sir,

899
00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:52.970
I pity her and wish forher sake more than formine own

900
00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:55.330
mine fortunes were moreable to relieve her,

901
00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:57.570
but I am shepherd toanother man

902
00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:00.230
and do not shear thefleeces that I graze.

903
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:02.900
My master is of churlishdisposition

904
00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.070
and little reaks to findthe way to heaven

905
00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:07.000
by doing deeds ofhospitality.

906
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.570
Besides, his cote, hisflocks, and bounds of feed

907
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:14.000
are now on sale,

908
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.270
and at our sheepcote now,

909
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:17.030
by reason of his absence,

910
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:19.130
there is nothing that youwill feed on;

911
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:22.430
but what is, come see;

912
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:25.430
and in my voice, mostwelcome shall you be.

913
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:27.730
What is he shall buy theflock and pasture?

914
00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:30.500
That young swain that yousaw here but erewhile,

915
00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.970
that little cares forbuying any thing.

916
00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:37.430
I pray thee, if it standwith honesty,

917
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:40.670
buy thou the cottage,pasture, and the flock,

918
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:42.430
and thou shalt have to payfor it of us.

919
00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:45.130
And we will mend thywages.

920
00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:46.900
I like this place

921
00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.100
and willingly could wastemy time in it.

922
00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.700
Assuredly, the thing is tobe sold.

923
00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:54.070
Go with me.

924
00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:57.000
If you like upon reportthe soil, the profit,

925
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.100
and this way of life,

926
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.800
I will your very faithfulfeeder be

927
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.700
and buy it with your goldright suddenly.

928
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.570
Under the greenwood tree

929
00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:16.430
who loves to lie with me

930
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:18.830
and turn his merry note

931
00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:21.600
unto the sweet bird'sthroat.

932
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.430
Come hither, come hither,come hither.

933
00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:27.170
Here shall he see no enemy

934
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:31.830
but winter and roughweather.

935
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:39.500
More, more, I prithee,more.

936
00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.000
It will make youmelancholy, MonsieurJaques.

937
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.870
I thank it.

938
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:46.000
More, I prithee, more.

939
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.970
I can suck melancholy outof a song

940
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.700
as a weasel sucks eggs.

941
00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.600
More, I prithee, more.

942
00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:54.900
My voice is ragged.

943
00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.470
I know I cannot pleaseyou.

944
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:58.170
I do not desire you toplease me;

945
00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:00.400
I do desire you to sing.

946
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:04.430
Come, more; anotherstanzo.

947
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:05.670
Call you 'em stanzos?

948
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:07.170
What you will, MonsieurJaques.

949
00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:09.100
Nay, I care not for theirnames.

950
00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:10.600
They owe me nothing.

951
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.000
Will you sing?

952
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.430
More at your request thanto please myself.

953
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:16.030
Well then, if ever I thankany man,

954
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:18.230
I'll thank you.

955
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:19.430
Come, sing,

956
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:21.400
and you that will not,holdyour tongues.

957
00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.900
Well, I'll end the song.

958
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.300
Sirs, cover the while.

959
00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.630
The duke will drink underthis tree.

960
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:29.070
He hath been all this dayto look you.

961
00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:32.730
And I have been all thisday to avoid him.

962
00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:34.700
He is too disputable formy company.

963
00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:38.370
I think of as many mattersas he,

964
00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:41.970
but I give heaven thanksand make no boast of them.

965
00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:44.170
Come, warble, come.

966
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:50.030
Who doth ambition shun

967
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:52.630
and loves to live i' thesun,

968
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:55.270
seeking the food he eats

969
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:58.100
and pleased with what hegets?

970
00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:01.100
Come hither, come hither,come hither.

971
00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.500
Here shall he see no enemy

972
00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:07.670
but winter and roughweather.

973
00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.030
I'll give you a verse

974
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:12.930
to this note that I madeyesterday

975
00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:14.670
in despite of myinvention.

976
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:16.330
And I'll sing it.

977
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:18.970
Thus it goes:

978
00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:21.970
If it do come to pass

979
00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:26.030
that any man turn ass,

980
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:27.800
leaving his wealth andease,

981
00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.970
a stubborn will toplease--

982
00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:35.130
ducdame, ducdame,ducdame--

983
00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:39.470
there shall he see grossfools as he,

984
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:42.370
and if he will, come tome.

985
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:45.670
What's that "ducdame"?

986
00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:54.330
'Tis a Greek invocation tocall fools into a circle.

987
00:49:57.530 --> 00:50:00.030
Oh, I'll go sleep if Ican.

988
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.900
If I cannot,

989
00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:05.830
I'll rail against all thefirst-born of Egypt.

990
00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:11.370
If it do come to pass

991
00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:13.930
that any man turn ass,

992
00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.770
leaving his wealth andease,

993
00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:19.600
a stubborn will toplease--

994
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:22.470
ducdame, ducdame,ducdame--

995
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:25.000
here shall he see grossfools as he,

996
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.300
and if he will, come tome.

997
00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:53.470
Dear master, I can go nofurther.

998
00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:56.130
O, I die for food.

999
00:50:56.130 --> 00:51:02.530
Here lie I down andmeasure out my grave.

1000
00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:06.900
Farewell, kind master.

1001
00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.400
How now, Adam.

1002
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.970
No greater heart in thee?

1003
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:15.730
Live a little; comfort alittle; cheer thyself alittle.

1004
00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:17.970
If this uncouth forestyield any thing savage,

1005
00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:20.670
I will either be food forit or bring it for food tothee.

1006
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.370
For my sake, becomfortable.

1007
00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:29.570
Hold death awhile at thearm's end.

1008
00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:32.230
I will here be with theepresently,

1009
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:34.100
and if I bring thee notsomething to eat,

1010
00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:35.500
I will give thee leave todie.

1011
00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:38.300
But if thou diest before Icome, thou art a mocker ofmy labour.

1012
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:41.000
Well said.

1013
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.700
Thou lookest cheerly,

1014
00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.070
and I will be with theequickly.

1015
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:49.870
Yet thou liest in thebleak air.

1016
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:53.930
Come, I will bear thee tosome shelter,

1017
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:55.930
and thou shalt not die forlack of a dinner

1018
00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:58.830
if there live any thing inthis desert.

1019
00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:01.230
Cheerly, good Adam.

1020
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:13.730
I think he be transform'dinto a beast,

1021
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:15.530
for I can no where findhim like a man.

1022
00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:17.400
My lord, he is but evennow gone hence.

1023
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.130
Here was he merry, hearingof a song.

1024
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:22.570
If he, compact of jars,grows musical,

1025
00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:25.770
we shall have shortlydiscord in the spheres.

1026
00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:27.870
How now, monsieur.

1027
00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:29.630
What a life is this,

1028
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:32.500
that your poor friendsmust woo your company?

1029
00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.170
What?

1030
00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:35.730
You look merrily.

1031
00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:42.600
A fool, a fool.

1032
00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:45.970
I met a fool in theforest,

1033
00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:48.200
a motley fool.

1034
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.430
Oh, a miserable world.

1035
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:52.200
As I do live by food,

1036
00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:56.200
I met a fool who laid himdown and bask'd him inthe sun

1037
00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:00.130
and rail'd on Lady Fortunein good terms,

1038
00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:01.730
in good set terms,

1039
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:03.800
and yet a motley fool.

1040
00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:06.530
"Good morrow, fool," quothI.

1041
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:08.570
"No, sir," quoth he.

1042
00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:12.830
"Call me not fool tillheaven hath sent mefortune,"

1043
00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:15.730
and then he drew a dialfrom his poke,

1044
00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:18.030
and, looking on it withlackluster eye,

1045
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:22.270
says very wisely, "It isten o'clock.

1046
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:26.730
Thus we may see," quothhe, "how the world wags.

1047
00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:28.870
"'Tis but an hour agosince it was nine,

1048
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:30.970
"and after one hour more'twill be eleven,

1049
00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:34.600
"and so from hour to hour,we ripe and ripe,

1050
00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:39.230
"and then from hour tohour, we rot and rot,

1051
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:42.200
and thereby hangs a tale."

1052
00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.070
But when I did hear themotley fool

1053
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:45.730
thus moral on the time,

1054
00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:48.370
my lungs began to crowlike chanticleer

1055
00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:52.230
that fools should be sodeep-contemplative,

1056
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:55.830
and I did laugh sansintermission

1057
00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:58.430
an hour by his dial.

1058
00:53:58.430 --> 00:54:00.770
O noble fool.

1059
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:02.730
A worthy fool.

1060
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:05.070
Motley's the only wear.

1061
00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:06.430
What fool is this?

1062
00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:09.730
A worthy fool, one thathath been a courtier,

1063
00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:12.870
and says if ladies be butyoung and fair,

1064
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:16.070
they have the gift toknow it.

1065
00:54:16.070 --> 00:54:17.670
And in his brain,

1066
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:20.100
which is as dry as theremainder biscuit

1067
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.270
after a voyage,

1068
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:25.330
he hath strange placescramm'd with observation

1069
00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:29.430
the which he vents inmangled forms.

1070
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:32.900
O that I were a fool.

1071
00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:36.330
I am ambitious for amotley coat.

1072
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:37.530
Thou shalt have one.

1073
00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:40.330
It is my only suit,

1074
00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:44.230
I must have libertywithal, as large a charteras the wind,

1075
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:46.700
to blow on whom I please,

1076
00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.370
for so fools have.

1077
00:54:48.370 --> 00:54:50.970
Invest me in my motley.

1078
00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:53.130
Give me leave to speak mymind,

1079
00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:54.670
and I will, through andthrough,

1080
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:58.630
cleanse the foul body ofthe infected world

1081
00:54:58.630 --> 00:55:01.330
if they will patientlyreceive my medicine.

1082
00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:02.530
Fie on thee.

1083
00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:05.170
I can tell thee what thouwouldst do.

1084
00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:07.970
What, for a counter, wouldI do but good?

1085
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:12.730
Most mischievous foul sinin chiding sin,

1086
00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:17.370
for thou thyself hast beena libertine

1087
00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:20.430
as sensual as the brutishsting itself,

1088
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:24.200
and all the embossed soresand headed evils

1089
00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.830
which thou with licence offree foot hast caught

1090
00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:29.670
wouldst thou disgorge intothe general world.

1091
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:31.530
Why, who cries out onpride

1092
00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:34.730
that can therein tax anyprivate party?

1093
00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:37.230
Doth it not flow as hugelyas the sea

1094
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:40.270
till that the wearer'svery means do ebb?

1095
00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:41.900
What woman in the city doI name

1096
00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:44.900
when that I say the citywoman bears the cost ofprinces

1097
00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:46.100
on unworthy shoulders?

1098
00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:48.630
Who can come in and saythat I mean her

1099
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:51.430
when such a one as shesuch is her neighbour?

1100
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:53.900
Or what is he of basestfunction

1101
00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:56.700
that says his bravery isnot of my cost

1102
00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:58.100
thinking that I mean him

1103
00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:01.600
but therein suits hisfolly to the mettle of myspeech?

1104
00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.070
There then;

1105
00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:04.330
how then?

1106
00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:05.570
What then?

1107
00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:08.470
Let me see wherein mytongue hath wrong'd him.

1108
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:11.200
If it do him right, thenhe hath wrong'd himself.

1109
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.630
If he be free,

1110
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:15.530
why then my taxing, like awild goose, flies,

1111
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:17.830
unclaim'd of any man.

1112
00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:19.900
Forbear, and eat no more!

1113
00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:21.230
Why, I have eat none yet.

1114
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:23.500
Nor shalt not tillnecessity be served.

1115
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:26.400
Of what kind should thiscock come of?

1116
00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.530
Art thou thus bolden'd,man, by thy distress

1117
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:32.100
or else a rude despiser ofgood manners

1118
00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:34.600
that in civility thouseem'st so empty?

1119
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.100
You touch'd my vein atfirst.

1120
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.730
The thorny point of baredistress

1121
00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:40.070
hath ta'en from me theshow of smooth civility.

1122
00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:42.630
Yet, am I inland bred andknow some nurture.

1123
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:44.270
But forbear, I say.

1124
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:46.430
He dies that touches anyof this fruit

1125
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:48.300
till I and my affairs areanswered.

1126
00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:51.370
And you will not beanswered with reason, Imust die.

1127
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:55.470
What wouldst thou have?

1128
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:57.630
Thy gentleness shall force

1129
00:56:57.630 --> 00:57:00.470
more than your force moveus to gentleness.

1130
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:03.670
I almost die for food, andlet me have it!

1131
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:07.230
Sit down and feed, andwelcome to our table.

1132
00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:10.870
Speak you so gently?

1133
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:12.330
Pardon me, I pray you.

1134
00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:14.470
I thought that all thingshad been savage here

1135
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:15.700
and therefore put I on

1136
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.570
the countenance of sterncommandment.

1137
00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:21.400
But whate'er you are thatin this desert inaccessible

1138
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.200
under the shade ofmelancholy boughs

1139
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.700
lose and neglect thecreeping hours of time,

1140
00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.130
if ever you have look'd onbetter days,

1141
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:31.530
if ever been where bellshave knoll'd to church,

1142
00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:33.200
if ever sat at any goodman's feast,

1143
00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.100
if ever from your eyelidswiped a tear

1144
00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:37.870
and know what 'tis to pityand be pitied,

1145
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:41.570
let gentleness my strongenforcement be.

1146
00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:46.030
In the which hope I blushand hide my sword.

1147
00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:50.070
True is it that we haveseen better days,

1148
00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:52.230
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

1149
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:54.630
Therefore, sit you down ingentleness

1150
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:56.770
and take upon command whathelp we have

1151
00:57:56.770 --> 00:57:58.670
that to your wanting maybe minister'd.

1152
00:57:58.670 --> 00:58:00.800
Then but forbear your fooda little while

1153
00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.700
whiles, like a doe, I goto find my fawn and giveit food.

1154
00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:05.200
There is an old poor man

1155
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.700
who after me hath many aweary step limp'd in purelove.

1156
00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:09.030
Till he be first sufficed,

1157
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:11.270
oppress'd with two weakevils, age and hunger,

1158
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:12.470
I will not touch a bit.

1159
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:13.930
Go find him out,

1160
00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:15.970
and we will nothing wastetill you return.

1161
00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:17.570
I thank ye,

1162
00:58:17.570 --> 00:58:20.070
and be blessed for yourgood comfort.

1163
00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:28.030
Thou seest we are not allalone unhappy.

1164
00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:32.130
This wide and universaltheater presents morewoeful pageants

1165
00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:33.900
than the scene wherein weplay in.

1166
00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:37.270
All the world's a stage

1167
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:41.200
and all the men and womenmerely players.

1168
00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.400
They have their exits andtheir entrances,

1169
00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:48.200
and one man in his timeplays many parts,

1170
00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:51.400
his acts being seven ages:

1171
00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:53.100
at first the infant,

1172
00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:57.130
mewling and puking in thenurse's arms;

1173
00:58:57.130 --> 00:58:58.730
and then the whiningschoolboy

1174
00:58:58.730 --> 00:59:01.170
with his satchel andshining morning face,

1175
00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:05.200
creeping like snailunwillingly to school;

1176
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.300
and then the lover,sighing like furnace,

1177
00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:13.030
with a woeful ballad madeto his mistress' eyebrow;

1178
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:14.600
then a soldier,

1179
00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:18.230
full of strange oaths andbearded like the pard,

1180
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:21.070
jealous in honor, suddenand quick in quarrel,

1181
00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:25.970
seeking the bubblereputation even in thecannon's mouth;

1182
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:27.500
and then the justice,

1183
00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:31.800
in fair round belly withgood capon lined,

1184
00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:35.700
with eyes severe and beardof formal cut,

1185
00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:41.030
full of wise saws andmodern instances,

1186
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:44.270
and so he plays his part.

1187
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:46.630
The sixth age shifts

1188
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:50.170
into the lean andslipper'd pantaloon,

1189
00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:54.470
with spectacles on noseand pouch on side,

1190
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:57.530
his youthful hose,well-saved,

1191
00:59:57.530 --> 01:00:02.470
the world too wide for hisshrunk shank,

1192
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:04.700
and his big, manly voice

1193
01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.830
turning again towardchildish treble,

1194
01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:13.900
pipes and whistles in hissound.

1195
01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.100
Last scene of all

1196
01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:22.670
that ends this strange,eventful history,

1197
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:25.970
is second childishness

1198
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:29.430
and mere oblivion,

1199
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:32.470
sans teeth,

1200
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:34.400
sans eyes,

1201
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.430
sans taste,

1202
01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:40.630
sans everything.

1203
01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:52.500
Set down your venerableburden.

1204
01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.230
And let him feed.

1205
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:04.170
I thank you most for him.

1206
01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:07.000
So had you need.

1207
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I scarce can speak tothank you for myself.

1208
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.670
Welcome; fall to.

1209
01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:20.230
I will not trouble you asyet

1210
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:24.100
to question you about yourfortunes.

1211
01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.230
Give us some music,

1212
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:28.170
and, good cousin, sing.

1213
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:40.300
Blow, blow, thou winterwind.

1214
01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:44.630
Thou art not so unkind

1215
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:48.300
as man's ingratitude.

1216
01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:53.530
Thy tooth is not so keen

1217
01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:58.230
because thou art not seen,

1218
01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:01.000
although thy breath berude.

1219
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.200
Heigh-ho.

1220
01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:06.400
Sing, heigh-ho

1221
01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:11.130
unto the green holly.

1222
01:02:11.130 --> 01:02:16.470
Most friendship isfeigning.

1223
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:21.800
Most loving, mere folly.

1224
01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:25.200
Then, heigh-ho, the holly,

1225
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:30.530
this life is most jolly.

1226
01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:37.500
Freeze, freeze, thoubitter sky,

1227
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:42.030
that dost not bite so nigh

1228
01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:45.370
as benefits forgot.

1229
01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:50.730
Though thou the waterswarp,

1230
01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:55.170
thy sting is not so sharp

1231
01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:58.230
as friend remember'd not.

1232
01:02:58.230 --> 01:03:00.470
Heigh-ho.

1233
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:03.730
Sing, heigh-ho

1234
01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:08.230
unto the green holly.

1235
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:13.470
Most friendship isfeigning.

1236
01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:18.600
Most loving, mere folly.

1237
01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.000
Then, heigh-ho, the holly,

1238
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.730
this life is most jolly.

1239
01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:33.870
If that you were the goodSir Rowland's son

1240
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:37.130
as you have whisper'dfaithfully you were,

1241

I am the duke that lovedyour father.

1245
01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:51.700
Good old man,

1246
01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:56.000
thou art right welcome asthy master is.

1247
01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.100
Not see him since?

1248
01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:12.570
Sir, sir, that cannot be!

1249
01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:16.500
But were I not the betterpart made mercy,

1250
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.900
I should not seek

1251
01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:22.430
an absent argument of myrevenge, thou peasant.

1252
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:24.570
So look to it!

1253
01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:28.130
Find out thy brotherwheresoe'er he is!

1254
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:30.330
Seek him with candle!

1255
01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:34.530
Bring him dead or livingwithin this twelvemonth,

1256
01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:36.270
or turn thou no more

1257
01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:38.030
to seek a living in ourterritories.

1258
01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:40.170
Thy lands and all things

1259
01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:42.970
that thou dost call thineworth seizure

1260
01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:44.700
do we seize into our hands

1261
01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:49.630
till thou canst quit theeby thy brother's mouth

1262
01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:51.400
of what we think againstthee.

1263
01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:54.130
O that your highness knewmy heart in this.

1264
01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:56.330
I never loved my brotherin my life.

1265
01:04:56.330 --> 01:04:58.330
More villain thou.

1266
01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:02.570
Well, push him out ofdoors!

1267
01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.700
And let my officers ofsuch a nature

1268
01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:10.170
make an extent upon hishouse and lands.

1269
01:05:10.170 --> 01:05:15.230
Do this expediently, andturn him going!

1270
01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:27.270
Hang there, my verse, in witnessof my love:

1271
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:31.100
And thou, thrice-crowned queenof night, survey

1272
01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:34.900
with thy chaste eye from thypale sphere above

1273
01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:39.870
thy huntress' name that my fulllife doth sway.

1274
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:47.170
O Rosalind,

1275
01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:50.070
these trees shall be my books,

1276
01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:53.500
and in their barks, my thoughtsI'll character

1277
01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:57.000
that every eye which in thisforest looks

1278
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:02.400
shall see thy virtue witness'deverywhere.

1279
01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.930
Run, run, Orlando.

1280
01:06:04.930 --> 01:06:06.930
Carve on every tree

1281
01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:13.970
the fair, the chaste, andunexpressive she.

1282
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:29.070
Uh.

1283
01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:31.170
And how like you this shepherd'slife,

1284
01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:32.930
Master Touchstone?

1285
01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:34.930
Truly, shepherd, in respect ofitself,

1286
01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:36.530
it is a good life,

1287
01:06:36.530 --> 01:06:39.730
but in respect that it is ashepherd's life,

1288
01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:41.700
it is naught.

1289
01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:44.530
In respect that it is solitary,I like it very well,

1290
01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:47.970
but in respect that it isprivate,

1291
01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:50.100
it is a very vile life.

1292
01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:52.030
Now, in respect it is in thefields,

1293
01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:53.500
it pleaseth me well;

1294
01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:56.530
but in respect it is not in thecourt, it is tedious.

1295
01:06:56.530 --> 01:06:59.470
As is it a spare life, look you,it fits my humor well;

1296
01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:01.800
but as there is no more plentyin it,

1297
01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.830
it goes much against my stomach.

1298
01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:08.130
Hast any philosophy in thee,shepherd?

1299
01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:11.600
No more but that I know the moreone sickens,

1300
01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.670
the worse at ease he is

1301
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:16.730
and that he that wants money,means, and content

1302
01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:19.930
is without three good friends;

1303
01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:24.200
the property of rain is to wetand fire to burn;

1304
01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:27.070
that good pasture makes fatsheep

1305
01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:31.470
and that a great cause of thenight is lack of the sun;

1306
01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:35.070
that he that hath learned no witby nature nor art

1307
01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:40.630
may complain of good breeding orcomes of a very dull kindred.

1308
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:42.730
Such a one is a naturalphilosopher.

1309
01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:44.500
Wast ever in court, shepherd?

1310
01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.800
No, truly.

1311
01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.470
Then thou art damned.

1312
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:48.730
Nay, I hope.

1313
01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:50.970
Truly, thou art damned like anill-roasted egg,

1314
01:07:50.970 --> 01:07:52.200
all on one side.

1315
01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.870
For not being at court?

1316
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:56.100
Oh, your reason?

1317
01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.670
Why, if thou never wast atcourt,

1318
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:59.170
thou never sawest good manners;

1319
01:07:59.170 --> 01:08:02.400
if thou never sawest goodmanners, thy manners must bewicked;

1320
01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.500
and wickedness is sin, and sinis damnation.

1321
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.430
Thou art in a parlous state,shepherd.

1322
01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:08.570
Not a whit, Touchstone:

1323
01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:10.570
those that are good manners atthe court

1324
01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:12.070
are as ridiculous in the country

1325
01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:15.830
as the behavior of the countryis most mockable at the court.

1326
01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:18.630
You told me that you salute notat the court,

1327
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:20.300
but you kiss your hands.

1328
01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:24.030
That courtesy would be uncleanlyif courtiers were shepherds.

1329
01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:26.670
Instance, briefly; come,instance.

1330
01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:29.900
Why, we are still handling ourewes,

1331
01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:31.900
and their fells, you know, aregreasy.

1332
01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:33.930
Why, do not your courtier'shands sweat?

1333
01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:35.930
And is not the grease of amutton

1334
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:37.800
as wholesome as the sweat of aman?

1335
01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:38.930
Shallow, shallow.

1336
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:40.730
A better instance, I say; come.

1337
01:08:40.730 --> 01:08:43.400
Besides, our hands are hard.

1338
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.200
Your lips will feel them thesooner.

1339
01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.400
Shallow again.

1340
01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.530
A more sounder instance, come.

1341
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:52.030
And they are often tarred overwith the surgery of our sheep:

1342
01:08:52.030 --> 01:08:55.030
and would you have us kiss tar?

1343
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:58.170
The courtier's hands areperfumed with civet.

1344
01:08:59.370 --> 01:09:01.700
Most shallow man,

1345
01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:05.570
thou worm's meat in respect of agood piece of flesh indeed.

1346
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:08.670
Learn of the wise, and perpend.

1347
01:09:08.670 --> 01:09:11.700
Civet is of a baser birth thantar,

1348
01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:14.600
the very uncleanly flux of acat.

1349
01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.600
Mend the instance, shepherd.

1350
01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:19.570
You have too courtly a wit forme.

1351
01:09:19.570 --> 01:09:20.870
I'll rest.

1352
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:22.330
Wilt thou rest damned?

1353
01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:28.500
God help thee, shallow man.

1354
01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:31.130
God make incision in thee.

1355
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:33.230
Thou art raw.

1356
01:09:33.230 --> 01:09:37.470
Sir, I am a true laborer.

1357
01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:39.430
I earn that I eat,

1358
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:40.900
get that I wear,

1359
01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:42.100
owe no man hate,

1360
01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:44.070
envy no man's happiness,

1361
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:45.970
glad of other men's good,

1362
01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:48.600
content with my harm,

1363
01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.970
and the greatest of my pride

1364
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:53.770
is to see my ewes graze and mylambs suck.

1365
01:09:53.770 --> 01:09:55.930
That is another simple sin inyou,

1366
01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:58.700
to bring the ewes and the ramstogether

1367
01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:02.070
and to offer to get your livingby the copulation of cattle.

1368
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:03.670
If thou beest not damned forthis,

1369
01:10:03.670 --> 01:10:05.630
the devil himself will have noshepherds.

1370
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:08.000
I cannot see else how thoushouldst 'scape.

1371
01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:27.930
"From the east to western Ind,

1372
01:10:27.930 --> 01:10:32.470
"no jewel is like Rosalind.

1373
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:35.430
"Her worth, being mounted on thewi--

1374
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:36.970
"wind,

"through all the world bearsRosalind.

"All the pictures fairest lined

1377
01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.770
"are but black to Rosalind.

1378
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:48.130
"Let no face be kept in mind

1379
01:10:48.130 --> 01:10:51.470
but the fair of Rosalind."

1380
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:53.670
I'll rhyme you so eight yearstogether,

1381
01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:56.230
dinners and suppers andsleeping-hours excepted.

1382
01:10:56.230 --> 01:10:59.370
This is the right butter-women'srank to market.

1383
01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:00.670
Out, fool.

1384
01:11:00.670 --> 01:11:01.870
For a taste:

1385
01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:04.100
If a hart do lack a hind,

1386
01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:06.400
let him seek out Rosalind.

1387
01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.030
If the cat will after kind,

1388
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:10.670
so be sure will Rosalind.

1389
01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:12.600
Winter garments must be lined.

1390
01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.130
so must slender Rosalind.

1391
01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:17.300
They that reap must sheaf andbind;

1392
01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:19.570
then to cart with Rosalind.

1393
01:11:19.570 --> 01:11:21.470
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind.

1394
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:23.430
Such a nut is Rosalind.

1395
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:25.870
He that sweetest rose will find

1396
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:29.500
must find love's prick andRosalind.

1397
01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.370
This is the very false gallop ofverses.

1398
01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:34.500
Why do you infect yourself withthem?

1399
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.270
Peace, you dull fool.

1400
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:38.100
I found them on a tree.

1401
01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.830
Truly, the tree yields badfruit.

1402
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:42.100
I'll graff it with you,

1403
01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:43.930
and then I shall graff it with amedlar.

1404
01:11:43.930 --> 01:11:46.970
and then, it will be theearliest fruit of the country;

1405
01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:49.230
for you'll be rotten ere you behalf ripe,

1406
01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:51.200
and that's the right virtue ofthe medlar.

1407
01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.570
Ooh, you have said,but whetherwisely or no,

1408
01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:55.600
let the forest judge.

1409
01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.570
Peace, here comes my sister,reading.

1410
01:11:57.570 --> 01:11:58.570
Let's stand aside.

1411
01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:04.430
"Why should this a desert be?

1412
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:06.070
"For it is unpeopled?

1413
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:07.800
"No.

1416
01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:14.870
Hmm.

"Atalanta's better part,

1429
01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:49.300
"sad Lucretia's modesty.

1430
01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:53.270
"Thus Rosalind of many parts

1431
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:55.670
"by heavenly synod was devised

1432
01:12:55.670 --> 01:12:58.570
"of many faces, eyes, and hearts

01:12:58.570 --> 01:13:01.770
"to have the touches dearestprized.

1434
01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:04.300
"Heaven would that she thesegifts should have

1435
01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:08.670
and I to live and die herslave."

1436
01:13:08.670 --> 01:13:11.230
O most gentle pulpiter!

1437
01:13:11.230 --> 01:13:12.770
What tedious homily of love

1438
01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:14.830
have you wearied yourparishioners withal

1439
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:17.600
and never cried, "Have patience,good people."

1440
01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.230
How now.

1441
01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:20.830
Back, friends.

1442
01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:23.400
Shepherd, go off a little.

1443
01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.400
Go with him, sirrah.

1444
01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:28.270
Come, shepherd, let us make anhonorable retreat,

1445
01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:30.000
though not with bag and baggage,

1446
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.430
yet with scrip and scrippage.

1447
01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:34.930
Didst thou hear these verses?

1448
01:13:34.930 --> 01:13:37.200
O, yes, I heard them all andmore too,

1449
01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:40.730
for some of them had in themmore feet than the verses wouldbear.

1450
01:13:40.730 --> 01:13:42.700
But didst thou hear withoutwondering

1451
01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:46.470
how thy name should be hangedand carved upon these trees?

1452
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:48.830
I was seven of the nine days outof the wonder

1453
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:50.330
before you came,

1454
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:53.730
for look you here what I foundon a palm tree.

1455
01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:57.400
I was never so be-rhymed sincePythagoras' time

1456
01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.330
that I was an Irish rat that Ican hardly remember.

1457
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:04.170
Trow you who hath done this?

1458
01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:06.470
Is it a man?

1459
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:07.630
Mm-hmm.

1460
01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:11.870
And a chain, that you once wore,about his neck.

1461
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:14.230
Change you color?

1462
01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:15.470
I prithee, who?

1463
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:16.730
O Lord, Lord.

1464
01:14:16.730 --> 01:14:18.570
It is a hard matter for friendsto meet,

1465
01:14:18.570 --> 01:14:21.270
but mountains may be removedwith earthquakes

1466
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:22.630
and so encounter.

1467
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:25.300
Nay, but who is it?

1468
01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:26.570
Is it possible?

1469
01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:29.900
Nay, I prithee now with mostpetitionary vehemence,

1470
01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.200
tell me who it is.

1471
01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.900
O wonderful, wonderful, and mostwonderful.

1472
01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.200
Wonderful, and yet againwonderful,

1473
01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:39.730
and after that, out of allhooping.

1474
01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:41.830
Good my complexion, dost thouthink,

1475
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:43.530
though I am caparisoned like aman,

1476
01:14:43.530 --> 01:14:46.370
I have a doublet and hose in mydisposition?

1477
01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:50.330
One inch of delay more is aSouth sea of discovery.

1478
01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:53.900
I prithee, tell me who is itquickly, and speak apace.

1479
01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:56.670
I prithee, take the cork out ofthy mouth

1480
01:14:56.670 --> 01:14:58.930
that I may drink thy tidings.

1481
01:14:58.930 --> 01:15:01.900
So you may put a man in yourbelly.

1482
01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.470
Is he of God's making?

1483
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:04.830
What manner of man?

1484
01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:07.600
Is his head worth a hat or hischin worth a beard?

1485
01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.270
Nay, he hath but a little beard.

1486
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:13.630
Why, God will send him more ifthe man will be thankful.

1487
01:15:13.630 --> 01:15:15.530
Let me stay the growth of hisbeard

1488
01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:19.830
if you delay me not theknowledge of his chin.

1489
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:20.830
No.

1490
01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:26.130
It is young Orlando

1491
01:15:26.130 --> 01:15:28.000
that tripped up the wrestler'sheels

1492
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.870
and your heart both in aninstant.

1493
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:32.570
Nay, but the devil take mocking.

1494
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:35.430
Speak, sad brow and true maid.

1495
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:37.400
I' faith, coz, 'tis he.

1496
01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:40.830
Orlando?

1497
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:42.830
Orlando.

1498
01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:46.570
Oh.

1499
01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:49.900
Oh.

1500
01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:51.600
Alas the day!

1501
01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.730
What shall I do with my doubletand hose?

1502
01:15:53.730 --> 01:15:55.300
Oh.

1503
01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.870
What did he when thou sawesthim?

1504
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:58.070
What said he?

1505
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:59.270
How looked he?

1506
01:15:59.270 --> 01:16:00.530
Wherein went he?

1507
01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:01.770
What makes he here?

1508
01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:03.000
Did he ask for me?

1509
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.170
Where remains he?

1510
01:16:04.170 --> 01:16:05.430
How parted he with thee?

1511
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:07.430
And when shalt thou see himagain?

1512
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:09.600
Answer me in one word.

1513
01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:12.570
You must borrow me Gargantua'smouth first.

1514
01:16:12.570 --> 01:16:13.870
'Tis a word too great

1515
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:15.430
for any mouth of this age'ssize.

1516
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:19.630
Oh, but--but doth he know that Iam in this forest?

1517
01:16:19.630 --> 01:16:21.530
And in man's apparel?

1518
01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:25.070
Looks he as freshly as he didthe day he wrestled?

1519
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:27.830
It's as easy to count atomies

1520
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:29.800
as to resolve the propositionsof a lover,

1521
01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.600
but take a taste of my findinghim,

1522
01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.770
and relish it with goodobservance.

1523
01:16:35.770 --> 01:16:40.400
I found him under a tree, like adropped acorn.

1524
01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:44.800
It may well be called Jove'stree

1525
01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.170
when it drops forth such fruit.

1526
01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:49.300
Give me audience, good madam.

1527
01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.770
Proceed.

1528
01:16:51.770 --> 01:16:56.070
There lay he, stretched alonglike a wounded knight.

1529
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:58.030
Oh, though it be pity to seesuch a sight,

1530
01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:01.270
yet it well becomes the ground.

1531
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:02.970
Cry holla to thy tongue, Iprithee.

1532
01:17:02.970 --> 01:17:06.000
It curvets unseasonably.

1533
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.670
He was furnished like a hunter.

1534
01:17:09.670 --> 01:17:10.830
O, ominous.

1535
01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:12.600
He comes to kill my heart.

1536
01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:15.030
I would sing my song without aburden.

1537
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:16.600
Thou bringest me out of tune.

1538
01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:18.400
Do you not know I am a woman?

1539
01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.800
When I think, I must speak.

1540
01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.630
Sweet, say on.

1541
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:23.970
You bring me out.

1542
01:17:24.970 --> 01:17:26.170
Soft.

1543
01:17:26.170 --> 01:17:28.300
Comes he not here?

1544
01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:32.630
'Tis he.

1545
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:38.630
Slink by, and note him.

1546
01:17:40.570 --> 01:17:41.770
Oh!

1547
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:44.470
I thank you for your company,

1548
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:47.070
but, good faith, I had as liefhave been myself alone.

1549
01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:49.370
And so had I, but yet, forfashion sake,

1550
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:50.970
I thank you too for yoursociety.

1551
01:17:50.970 --> 01:17:52.200
God by you.

1552
01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.770
Let's meet as little as we can.

1553
01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:57.830
I do desire we may be betterstrangers.

1554
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:59.730
I pray you,

1555
01:17:59.730 --> 01:18:01.100
mar no more trees

1556
01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:04.970
with writing love songs in theirbarks.

1557
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:07.830
I pray you, mar no more of myverses

1558
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:11.430
with reading them ill-favoredly.

1559
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:13.270
Rosalind is your love's name?

1560
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:15.430
Yes, just.

1561
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:16.730
I do not like her name.

1562
01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:18.470
There was no thought of pleasingyou

1563
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:20.900
when she was christened.

1564
01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:22.400
What stature is she of?

1565
01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:25.900
Just as high as my heart.

1566
01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:27.470
You are full of pretty answers.

1567
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:29.900
Have you not been acquaintedwith goldsmiths' wives

1568
01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:31.270
and conned them out of rings?

1569
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:33.870
Not so; but I answer you rightpainted cloth

1570
01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:36.000
from whence you have studiedyour questions.

1571
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.300
You have a nimble wit.

1572
01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:41.500
I think 'twas made of Atalanta'sheels.

1573
01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:42.800
Will you sit down with me?

1574
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.130
And we two will rail against ourmistress the world

1575
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:48.070
and all our misery.

1576
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:50.830
I will chide no breather in theworld except myself,

1577
01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:52.970
against whom I know most faults.

1578
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:56.100
The worst fault you have is tobe in love.

1579
01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:59.530
'Tis a fault I will not changefor your best virtue.

1580
01:18:59.530 --> 01:19:01.500
I am weary of you.

1581
01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:04.030
By my troth, I was seeking for afool when I found you.

1582
01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:05.300
He is drowned in the brook.

1583
01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:07.530
Look but in, and you shall seehim.

1584
01:19:09.170 --> 01:19:11.530
There I shall see mine ownfigure.

1585
01:19:11.530 --> 01:19:15.200
Which I take to be either a foolor a cipher.

1586
01:19:17.730 --> 01:19:20.930
I'll tarry no longer with you.

1587
01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:23.770
Farewell, good Signior Love.

1588
01:19:23.770 --> 01:19:25.270
I am glad of your departure.

1589
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:27.200
Adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy.

1590
01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.530
I'll speak to him like a saucylackey

1591
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:38.470
and under that habit play theknave with him.

1592
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:39.870
Do you hear, forester?

1593
01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.270
Very well.

1594
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:44.370
What would you?

1595
01:19:44.370 --> 01:19:48.930
I pray you, what is't o'clock?

1596
01:19:48.930 --> 01:19:51.900
You should ask me what time o'day.

1597
01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:54.130
There's no clock in the forest.

1598
01:19:54.130 --> 01:19:56.470
Then there is no true lover inthe forest,

1599
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:59.370
else sighing every minute andgroaning every hour

1600
01:19:59.370 --> 01:20:00.970
would detect the lazy foot ofTime

1601
01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:02.200
as well as a clock.

1602
01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:05.130
And why not the swift foot ofTime?

1603
01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:07.070
Had not that been as proper?

1604
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:08.730
By no means, sir.

1605
01:20:08.730 --> 01:20:12.600
Time travels in divers paceswith divers persons.

1606
01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.600
I'll tell you who Time ambleswithal,

1607
01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:18.830
who Time trots withal, who Timegallops withal,

1608
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:20.630
and who he stands still withal.

1609
01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:25.070
I prithee, who doth he trotwithal?

1610
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:28.330
Marry, he trots hard with ayoung maid

1611
01:20:28.330 --> 01:20:30.100
between the contract of hermarriage

1612
01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.700
and the--the--and the day thatit is solemnized,

1613
01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:35.070
for if the interim be but ase'nnight,

1614
01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:38.630
Time's pace is so hard it seemsthe length of seven year.

1615
01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:41.600
Who ambles Time withal?

1616
01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.530
With a priest that lacks Latin

1617
01:20:43.530 --> 01:20:45.700
and a rich man that hath not thegout,

1618
01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:49.330
for the one sleeps easilybecause he cannot study;

1619
01:20:49.330 --> 01:20:52.670
the other lives merrily becausehe feels no pain,

1620
01:20:52.670 --> 01:20:56.130
the one lacking the burden oflean and wasteful learning,

1621
01:20:56.130 --> 01:20:59.630
the other feeling no burden ofheavy tedious penury.

1622
01:20:59.630 --> 01:21:02.830
These, Time ambles withal.

1623
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.270
Who doth he gallop withal?

1624
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:06.600
With a thief to the gallows,

1625
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.930
for though he go as soft as footcan fall,

1626
01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:11.170
he thinks himself too soonthere.

1627
01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:15.330
Who stays it still withal?

1628
01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:22.530
With lawyers in the vacation,

1629
01:21:22.530 --> 01:21:24.400
for they sleep between term andterm

1630
01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:27.570
and then they perceive not howTime moves.

1631
01:21:27.570 --> 01:21:29.670
Where dwell you, pretty youth?

1632
01:21:29.670 --> 01:21:35.930
With this shepherdess,

1633
01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:37.030
my sister,

1634
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:38.870
here in the skirts of the forest

1635
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:41.070
like fringe upon a petticoat.

1636
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:43.230
Are you native of this place?

1637
01:21:43.230 --> 01:21:45.830
As the cony you see dwell whereshe is kindled.

1638
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:47.330
Your accent is something finer

1639
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:51.400
than you could purchase in soremoved a dwelling.

1640
01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:54.500
I have been told so of many,

1641
01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.370
and indeed, an old religiousuncle of mine

1642
01:21:57.370 --> 01:21:58.830
taught me to speak,

1643
01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:00.870
who was in his youth an inlandman,

1644
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:03.870
one that knew courtship toowell,

1645
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:05.170
for there he fell in love,

1646
01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:07.500
and I have heard him read manylectures against it,

1647
01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:12.330
and indeed, I thank God I am nota woman,

1648
01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:14.730
to be touched with so many giddyoffences

1649
01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:17.330
as he hath generally taxed theirwhole sex withal.

1650
01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:19.470
Can you remember any of theprincipal evils

1651
01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:21.070
that he lay to the charge ofwomen?

1652
01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:22.370
There were none principal.

1653
01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:24.630
They were all like one anotheras half pence are,

1654
01:22:24.630 --> 01:22:26.230
the one fault seeming monstrous

1655
01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:28.130
till his fellow fault came tomatch it.

1656
01:22:28.130 --> 01:22:30.270
I prithee, recount some of them.

1657
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:33.070
No, I will not cast away myphysic

1658
01:22:33.070 --> 01:22:35.300
but upon those that are sick.

1659
01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:39.930
There is a man haunts the forestthat abuses our young plants

1660
01:22:39.930 --> 01:22:43.330
with carving "R-R-Rosalind" ontheir barks,

1661
01:22:43.330 --> 01:22:48.130
hangs odes upon hawthorns,elegies upon brambles,

1662
01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:51.730
all, forsooth, deifying the nameof Rosalind.

1663
01:22:51.730 --> 01:22:54.670
If I could meet thatfancy-monger,

1664
01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:56.430
I would give him some goodcounsel,

1665
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:59.330
for he hath the quotidian oflove upon him.

1666
01:22:59.330 --> 01:23:02.000
I am he that is so love-shaked.

1667
01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.200
I pray you, tell me your remedy.

1668
01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:09.300
There is none of my uncle'smarks upon you.

1669
01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.570
He taught me how to know a manin love,

1670
01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:14.570
in which cage of rushes I amsure you are not prisoner.

1671
01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:16.100
And what were his marks?

1672
01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:18.730
A lean cheek, which you havenot;

1673
01:23:18.730 --> 01:23:21.200
a blue eye and sunken, which youhave not;

1674
01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:23.670
an unquestionable spirit, whichyou have not;

1675
01:23:23.670 --> 01:23:26.630
a beard neglected, which youhave not;

1676
01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:29.170
but I pardon you for that,

1677
01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:32.270
for simply your having in beardis a younger brother's revenue.

1678
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:35.030
Then your hose should beungartered,

1679
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:37.470
your bonnet unbanded, yoursleeve unbuttoned,

1680
01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:38.600
your shoe untied,

1681
01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.870
everything about you

1682
01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:44.930
demonstrating a carelessdesolation;

1683
01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:47.300
but you are no such man.

1684
01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:50.370
You are rather point-device inyour accoutrements

1685
01:23:50.370 --> 01:23:51.830
as loving yourself

1686
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:53.600
than seeming the lover of anyother.

1687
01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.730
Fair youth, I would I could makethee believe,

1688
01:23:55.730 --> 01:23:57.130
I love.

1689
01:23:57.130 --> 01:24:01.370
Me, believe it?

1690
01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:05.130
You may as soon make her thatyou love believe it,

1691
01:24:05.130 --> 01:24:08.200
which, I warrant, she is apterto do

1692
01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:09.800
than to confess that she does.

1693
01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.770
That is one of the points inwhich women

1694
01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:15.300
still give the lie to theirconsciences.

1695
01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:20.900
But in good sooth, are you hethat hangs the verses on thetrees

1696
01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:23.470
wherein Rosalind is so admired?

1697
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:26.200
I swear to thee, youth, by thewhite hand of Rosalind,

1698
01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:28.870
I am that he,

1699
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:30.700
that unfortunate he.

1700
01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:37.200
But are you so much in love asyour rhymes speak?

1701
01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:40.870
Neither rhyme nor reason canexpress how much.

1702
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:42.970
Ah, ha, ha!

1703
01:24:42.970 --> 01:24:46.870
Love is merely a madness and, Itell you,

1704
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:50.270
deserves as well a dark houseand a whip as madmen do,

1705
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:53.370
and the only reason they are notso punished and cured

1706
01:24:53.370 --> 01:24:55.330
is that the lunacy is soordinary

1707
01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:58.870
the whippers are in love too.

1708
01:24:58.870 --> 01:25:04.600
Yet I profess curing it bycounsel.

1709
01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.600
Did you ever cure any so?

1710
01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:13.430
Yes, one, and in this manner:

1711
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:16.900
he was to imagine me his love,

1712
01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:18.970
his mistress,

1713
01:25:18.970 --> 01:25:23.200
and I set him every day to woome,

1714
01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:29.770
at which time would I, being buta moonish youth,

1715
01:25:29.770 --> 01:25:34.630
grieve, be effeminate,changeable, longing and liking,

1716
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:38.700
proud, fantastical, full oftears, full of smiles,

1717
01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:41.670
for every passion something andfor no passion truly anything

1718
01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:44.470
as boys and women are for themost part

1719
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:47.570
cattle of this color;

1720
01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:49.300
now like him, now loathe him;

1721
01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:51.170
then entertain him, thenforswear him;

1722
01:25:51.170 --> 01:25:53.630
now weep for him, then spit athim

1723
01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:57.800
that I drave my suitor from hismad humor of love

1724
01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:00.670
to a living humor of madness,

1725
01:26:00.670 --> 01:26:04.470
which was to forswear the fullstream of the world

1726
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:06.700
and live in a nook merelymonastic.

1727
01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:08.770
And thus did I cure him,

1728
01:26:08.770 --> 01:26:12.770
and so will I take it on me

1729
01:26:12.770 --> 01:26:16.900
to wash your liver as clean as asound sheep's heart,

1730
01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:20.770
that there shall not be one spotof love in it.

1731
01:26:20.770 --> 01:26:22.700
I would not be cured, youth.

1732
01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:30.070
I would cure you if you wouldbut call me Rosalind

1733
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:34.970
and come to my cote every dayand woo me.

1734
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:43.470
Now, by the faith of my love, Iwill.

1735
01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:46.300
Tell me where it is.

1736
01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:48.300
Go with me to it, and I willshow it to you,

1737
01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:49.570
and by the way,

1738
01:26:49.570 --> 01:26:52.830
you shall tell me where in theforest you live.

1739
01:26:52.830 --> 01:26:54.270
Come; will you go?

1740
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:56.470
With all my heart, good youth.

1741
01:26:56.470 --> 01:27:01.500
Nay, you must call me Rosalind.

1742
01:27:02.770 --> 01:27:05.800
Come, sister, will you go?

1743
01:27:19.170 --> 01:27:21.070
Come apace, good Audrey.

1744
01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:23.400
I will fetch up your goats,Audrey.

1745
01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:33.600
And how, Audrey?

1746
01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.200
Am I the man yet?

1747
01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.500
Doth my simple feature contentyou?

1748
01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:39.970
Your features! Lord warrant us!

1749
01:27:39.970 --> 01:27:41.730
What features?

1750
01:27:41.730 --> 01:27:43.530
I am here with thee and thygoats

1751
01:27:43.530 --> 01:27:45.600
as the most capricious poet,honest Ovid,

1752
01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:46.900
was among the Goths.

1753
01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:48.970
O knowledge ill-inhabited,

1754
01:27:48.970 --> 01:27:50.900
worse than Jove in a thatchedhouse.

1755
01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:54.470
When a man's verses can't beunderstood

1756
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:55.830
or a man's good wit seconded

1757
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:57.800
with the forward childunderstanding,

1758
01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.770
it strikes a man more dead

1759
01:27:59.770 --> 01:28:03.070
than a great reckoning in alittle room.

1760
01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:06.530
Truly, I would the gods had madethee poetical.

1761
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:08.900
I do not know what "poetical"is.

1762
01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:10.930
Is it honest in deed and word?

1763
01:28:10.930 --> 01:28:12.230
Is it a true thing?

1764
01:28:12.230 --> 01:28:15.730
No, truly, for the truest poetryis the most feigning;

1765
01:28:15.730 --> 01:28:18.570
and lovers are given to poetry,

1766
01:28:18.570 --> 01:28:20.370
and what they swear in poetry

1767
01:28:20.370 --> 01:28:23.600
may be said as lovers they dofeign.

1768
01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:26.530
Do you wish then that the godshad made me poetical?

1769
01:28:26.530 --> 01:28:30.100
I do, truly; for thou swearestto me thou art honest.

1770
01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:32.130
Now, if thou wert a poet,

1771
01:28:32.130 --> 01:28:35.030
I might have some hope thoudidst feign.

1772
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:36.630
Oh, would you not have mehonest?

1773
01:28:36.630 --> 01:28:38.830
No, truly--

1774
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:40.700
unless thou wert hard-favored,

1775
01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:42.630
for honesty coupled to beauty

1776
01:28:42.630 --> 01:28:44.830
is to have honey a sauce tosugar.

1777
01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:46.300
A material fool!

1778
01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:48.370
Well, I am not fair,

1779
01:28:48.370 --> 01:28:51.300
and therefore, I pray the godsmake me honest.

1780
01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:53.500
Truly, and to cast away honestyupon a foul slut

1781
01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:55.830
were to put good meat into anunclean dish.

1782
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:57.630
I am not a slut,

1783
01:28:57.630 --> 01:28:59.700
though I thank the gods I amfoul.

1784
01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:03.330
Well, praised be the gods forthy foulness.

1785
01:29:03.330 --> 01:29:05.600
Sluttishness may come hereafter.

1786
01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:09.000
But be it as it may be,

1787
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.630
I will marry thee,

1788
01:29:11.630 --> 01:29:14.200
and to that end, I have beenwith Sir Oliver Martext,

1789
01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:15.730
the vicar of the next village,

1790
01:29:15.730 --> 01:29:18.230
who hath promised to meet me inthis place of the forest

1791
01:29:18.230 --> 01:29:20.100
and to couple us.

1792
01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:21.670
I would fain see this meeting.

1793
01:29:21.670 --> 01:29:23.400
Well, the gods give us joy!

1794
01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.830
Amen.

1795
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:27.670
Oh, a man may, if he were of afearful heart,

1796
01:29:27.670 --> 01:29:29.800
stagger in this attempt,

1797
01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:32.530
for here we have no temple butthe wood,

1798
01:29:32.530 --> 01:29:35.000
no assembly but horn-beasts.

1799
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.570
But what though?

1800
01:29:36.570 --> 01:29:37.700
Courage.

1801
01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:39.830
As horns are odious, they arenecessary.

1802
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:43.430
No, as a walled town is moreworthier than a village,

1803
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:45.170
so is the forehead of a marriedman

1804
01:29:45.170 --> 01:29:47.830
more honorable than the barebrow of a bachelor.

1805
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:49.100
Sir Oliver Martext,

1806
01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:50.700
you are well met.

1807
01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:52.770
Will you dispatch us here underthis tree?

1808
01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:54.530
Or shall we go with you to yourchapel?

1809
01:29:54.530 --> 01:29:57.430
Yes, yes, yes.

1810
01:29:57.430 --> 01:30:00.400
I-I-Is there none here to givethe woman?

1811
01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:02.300
I will not take her on gift ofany man.

1812
01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:03.930
Truly, sir, she must be given,

1813
01:30:03.930 --> 01:30:06.170
or the marriage is not lawful.

1814
01:30:06.170 --> 01:30:09.330
Proceed, proceed.

1815
01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:10.570
I'll give her.

1816
01:30:10.570 --> 01:30:12.500
Good even, good MasterWhat-ye-call't.

1817
01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:13.600
How do you, sir?

1818
01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:14.900
You are very well met.

1819
01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:17.100
I am very glad to see you--

1820
01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:19.030
even a toy in hand here, sir.

1821
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:20.500
Nay, pray be covered.

1822
01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:21.870
Will you be married, motley?

1823
01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:23.400
As the ox hath his bow, sir,

1824
01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.600
and the horse his curb and thefalcon her bells,

1825
01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.200
so a man hath his desires;

1826
01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:31.700
and as pigeons bill, so wedlockwould be nibbling.

1827
01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:33.600
Will you, being a man of yourbreeding,

1828
01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.900
be married under a bush like abeggar?

1829
01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:37.770
Get you to church, and have agood priest

1830
01:30:37.770 --> 01:30:40.230
that can tell you what marriageis.

1831
01:30:40.230 --> 01:30:42.200
This fellow will but join youtogether

1832
01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:44.000
as they join wainscot,

1833
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.470
and then one of you will prove ashrunk panel

1834
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:49.830
and, like green timber, warp--

1835
01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:53.800
warp.

1836
01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:55.530
I am not in the mind,

1837
01:30:55.530 --> 01:30:57.970
but I were better to be marriedof him than of another,

1838
01:30:57.970 --> 01:30:59.930
for he is not like to marry mewell,

1839
01:30:59.930 --> 01:31:01.600
and not being well-married,

1840
01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:03.600
it will be a good excuse for mehereafter

1841
01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:06.570
to leave my wife.

1842
01:31:06.570 --> 01:31:09.270
Go thou with me, and let mecounsel thee.

1843
01:31:10.670 --> 01:31:12.070
'Come, sweet Audrey.

1844
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:14.370
We must be married, or we mustlive in bawdry.

1845
01:31:14.370 --> 01:31:16.200
Farewell, good Master Oliver,

1846
01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:18.030
not, "O sweet Oliver, O braveOliver,

1847
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:19.270
leave me not behind thee,"

1848
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:20.430
but, "Wind away;

1849
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:21.630
"Begone, I say,

1850
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:23.670
I will not to wedding withthee."

1851
01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:28.870
'Tis no matter.

1852
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:32.000
There's ne'er a fantasticalknave of them all

1853
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.600
shall flout me out of mycalling.

1854
01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:48.070
Never talk to me.

1855
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:49.270
I will weep.

1856
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:51.170
Do, I prithee,

1857
01:31:51.170 --> 01:31:52.770
and yet have the grace toconsider

1858
01:31:52.770 --> 01:31:56.070
that tears do not become a man.

1859
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:58.300
Have I not cause to weep?

1860
01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:00.800
As good a cause as one coulddesire.

1861
01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:02.330
Therefore, weep.

1862
01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:05.970
His very hair is of thedissembling color.

1863
01:32:05.970 --> 01:32:08.800
Something browner than Judas'smarry.

1864
01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.800
His kisses are Judas's ownchildren.

1865
01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.730
I' faith, his hair is of a goodcolor.

1866
01:32:13.730 --> 01:32:16.000
An excellent color.

1867
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.030
Your chestnut was ever the onlycolor.

1868
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:22.370
And his kissing is as full ofsanctity

1869
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:24.500
as is the touch of holy bread.

1870
01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:29.470
A nun of winter's sisterhoodkisses not more religiously.

1871
01:32:29.470 --> 01:32:31.700
There is the ice of chastity inthem.

1872
01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:37.530
But why did he swear he wouldcome this morning

1873
01:32:37.530 --> 01:32:39.270
and comes not?

1874
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:42.230
Nay, certainly, there is notruth in him.

1875
01:32:42.230 --> 01:32:43.800
Not true in love?

1876
01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:46.170
When he is in, but I think he isnot in.

1877
01:32:46.170 --> 01:32:48.530
But you have heard him sweardownright he was.

1878
01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:50.330
"Was" is not "is."

1879
01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:54.900
Besides, the oath of a lover

1880
01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:57.630
is no stronger than the words ofa tapster.

1881
01:32:57.630 --> 01:33:02.670
They are both the confirmer offalse reckonings.

1882
01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:05.230
Oh, he attends here in theforest

1883
01:33:05.230 --> 01:33:06.870
on the duke thy father.

1884
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:10.370
I met the duke yesterday and hadmuch question with him.

1885
01:33:10.370 --> 01:33:12.200
He asked me of what parentage Iwas.

1886
01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:16.700
I told him of as good as he, andso he laughed and let me go.

1887
01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:19.570
But what talk we of fathers

1888
01:33:19.570 --> 01:33:22.330
when there is such a man asOrlando?

1889
01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:25.070
O, there's a brave man.

1890
01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:28.170
He writes brave verses, speaksbrave words,

1891
01:33:28.170 --> 01:33:31.800
swears brave oaths, and breaksthem bravely,

1892
01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:35.900
quite traverse, athwart theheart of his lover.

1893
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:38.270
But all's brave

1894
01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:41.000
that youth mounts and follyguides.

1895
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.070
Mistress and master,

1896
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:44.630
you have oft inquired

1897
01:33:44.630 --> 01:33:46.600
after the shepherd whocomplain'd of love

1898
01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:48.800
who you saw sitting by me on theturf,

1899
01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:51.030
praising the proud disdainfulshepherdess

1900
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:52.130
that was his mistress.

1901
01:33:52.130 --> 01:33:53.670
Well, and what of him?

1902
01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:55.730
If you would see a pageant trulyplay'd

1903
01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:57.900
between the pale complexion oftrue love

1904
01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:01.200
and the red glow of scorn andproud disdain,

1905
01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.500
go hence a little, and I shallconduct you

1906
01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:05.170
if you will mark it.

1907
01:34:05.170 --> 01:34:07.000
O, come, let us remove.

1908
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.400
The sight of lovers feedeththose in love.

1909
01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:10.430
Oh.

1910
01:34:13.170 --> 01:34:16.270
Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me.

1911
01:34:18.630 --> 01:34:19.870
Do not.

1912
01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:23.970
Phebe.

1913
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.970
Say that you love me not,

1914
01:34:29.970 --> 01:34:32.070
but say not so in bitterness.

1915
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:34.070
The common executioner,

1916
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:36.570
whose heart the accustom'd sightof death makes hard,

1917
01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:38.430
falls not the axe upon thehumbled neck

1918
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:40.330
but first begs pardon.

1919
01:34:40.330 --> 01:34:42.270
Will you sterner be than he

1920
01:34:42.270 --> 01:34:45.100
that dies and lives by bloodydrops?

1921
01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:47.000
I would not be thy executioner.

1922
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.600
I fly thee, for I would notinjure thee.

1923
01:34:55.570 --> 01:34:57.930
Thou tell'st me there is murderin mine eye.

1924
01:34:57.930 --> 01:34:59.800
'Tis pretty, sure, and veryprobable,

1925
01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:02.870
that eyes, that are the frail'stand softest things

1926
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:04.800
who shut their coward gates onatomies

1927
01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.970
should be call'd tyrants,butchers, murderers.

1928
01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:10.700
Now I do frown on thee with allmy heart,

1929
01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:15.600
and if mine eyes can wound, nowlet them kill thee.

1930
01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:17.900
Counterfeit to swoon.

1931
01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:19.600
Why now, fall down.

1932
01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:25.400
Or if thou canst not, O, forshame, for shame.

1933
01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:28.730
Lie not to say mine eyes aremurderers.

1934
01:35:28.730 --> 01:35:31.500
Now show the wound mine eye hathmade in thee.

1935
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:34.370
No, I am sure,

1936
01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:37.370
there is no force in eyes thatcan do hurt.

1937
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:40.100
O dear Phebe,

1938
01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:42.670
if ever as that ever may be near

1939
01:35:42.670 --> 01:35:46.500
you meet in some fresh cheek thepower of fancy,

1940
01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:48.530
then shall you know the woundsinvisible

1941
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:50.230
that love's keen arrows make.

1942
01:35:50.230 --> 01:35:54.400
But till that time, come notthou near me,

1943
01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:55.930
and when that time comes,

1944
01:35:55.930 --> 01:35:57.730
afflict me with thy mocks.

1945
01:35:57.730 --> 01:35:59.300
Pity me not,

1946
01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:01.770
as till that time, I shall notpity thee.

1947
01:36:01.770 --> 01:36:03.730
And why, I pray you?

1948
01:36:03.730 --> 01:36:07.100
Who might be your mother

1949
01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:10.100
that you insult, exult-- and allat once--

1950
01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:12.230
over the wretched?

1951
01:36:12.230 --> 01:36:13.870
What though you have no beauty--

1952
01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:15.430
as, by my life, I see no more inyou

1953
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:18.870
than without candle may go darkto bed--

1954
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:21.230
must you be therefore proud andpitiless?

1955
01:36:23.070 --> 01:36:24.700
Why, what means this?

1956
01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:26.300
Why do you look on me?

1957
01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:27.470
I see no more in you

1958
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:30.770
than in the ordinary of nature'ssale-work.

1959
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:35.300
'Od's my little life,

1960
01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:38.500
I think she means to tangle myeyes too.

1961
01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:41.570
No, faith, proud mistress, hopenot after it.

1962
01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:46.370
'Tis not your inky brows, yourblack silk hair,

1963
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:49.130
your bugle eyeballs, nor yourcheek of cream

1964
01:36:49.130 --> 01:36:52.570
that can entame my spirits toyour worship.

1965
01:36:52.570 --> 01:36:55.630
You foolish shepherd,

1966
01:36:55.630 --> 01:36:57.130
why do you follow her

1967
01:36:57.130 --> 01:37:01.430
like foggy south puffing withwind and rain?

1968
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:05.200
You are a thousand times aproperer man than she a woman.

1969
01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:06.530
'Tis such fools as you

1970
01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:09.870
as makes the world full ofill-favor'd children:

1971
01:37:09.870 --> 01:37:12.900
'Tis not her glass but you thatflatters her;

1972
01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:15.530
and out of you, she sees herselfmore proper

1973
01:37:15.530 --> 01:37:17.700
than any of her lineaments canshow her.

1974
01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:20.000
But, mistress, know yourself.

1975
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.970
Down on your knees and thankheaven, fasting,

1976
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:26.030
for a good man's love,

1977
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:31.170
for I must tell you friendly inyour ear,

1978
01:37:31.170 --> 01:37:32.830
sell when you can.

1979
01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:35.330
You are not for all markets.

1980
01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:37.100
Cry the man mercy.

1981
01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:38.400
Love him.

1982
01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:39.630
Take his offer.

1983
01:37:39.630 --> 01:37:45.470
Foul is most foul being foul tobe a scoffer.

1984
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:47.230
So take her to thee, shepherd.

1985
01:37:47.230 --> 01:37:48.500
Fare thee well.

1986
01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:53.330
Sweet youth, I pray you, chide ayear together.

1987
01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:56.170
I'd rather hear you chide thanthis man woo.

1988
01:37:56.170 --> 01:37:58.570
He's fallen in love with yourfoulness,

1989
01:37:58.570 --> 01:38:00.400
and she'll fall in love with myanger.

1990
01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:01.630
If it be so,

1991
01:38:01.630 --> 01:38:03.870
as fast as she answers thee withfrowning looks,

1992
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:07.270
I'll sauce her with bitterwords.

1993
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:08.930
Why look you so on me?

1994
01:38:08.930 --> 01:38:11.270
For no ill will I bear you.

1995
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:16.070
I pray you, do not fall in lovewith me,

1996
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:19.730
for I am falser than vows madein wine.

1997
01:38:19.730 --> 01:38:21.000
Besides, I like you not.

1998
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.470
I-If you will know my house,

1999
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:24.730
'tis at the tuft of olives herehard by.

2000
01:38:26.770 --> 01:38:30.130
Sister, will you go?

2001
01:38:30.130 --> 01:38:32.230
Shepherd, ply her hard.

2002
01:38:32.230 --> 01:38:33.630
Come, sister.

2003
01:38:33.630 --> 01:38:35.200
Shepherdess, look on him better,

2004
01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:36.870
and be not proud.

2005
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:38.870
Though all the world could see,

2006
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:41.230
none could be so abused in sightas he.

2007
01:38:41.230 --> 01:38:44.370
Come, to our flock.

2008
01:38:47.930 --> 01:38:53.930
Dead shepherd, now I find thysaw of might,

2009
01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:57.770
"Whoever loved that loved not atfirst sight?"

2010
01:39:00.630 --> 01:39:02.470
Sweet Phebe--

2011
01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:04.500
Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?

2012
01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:08.930
Sweet Phebe, pity me.

2013
01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:12.030
Why, I am sorry for thee, gentleSilvius.

2014
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:14.670
Wherever sorrow is, relief wouldbe.

2015
01:39:14.670 --> 01:39:17.470
If you do sorrow at my grief inlove,

2016
01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:18.970
then by giving love,

2017
01:39:18.970 --> 01:39:22.200
your sorrow and my grief wereboth extermined.

2018
01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.730
Thou hast my love.

2019
01:39:23.730 --> 01:39:25.400
Is not that neighborly?

2020
01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:26.830
I would have you.

2021
01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:29.970
Why, that were covetousness.

2022
01:39:29.970 --> 01:39:33.670
Silvius, the time was that Ihated thee,

2023
01:39:33.670 --> 01:39:36.000
and yet it is not that I bearthee love,

2024
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.830
but since that thou canst talkof love so well,

2025
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:40.800
thy company, which erst wasirksome to me,

2026
01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:41.970
I will endure,

2027
01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:44.070
and I'll employ thee too.

2028
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:46.130
But do not look for furtherrecompense

2029
01:39:46.130 --> 01:39:48.530
than thine own gladness thatthou art employ'd.

2030
01:39:48.530 --> 01:39:53.930
So holy and so perfect is mylove

2031
01:39:53.930 --> 01:39:56.270
and I in such a poverty of grace

2032
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:59.330
that I shall think it a mostplenteous crop

2033
01:39:59.330 --> 01:40:00.500
to glean the broken ears

2034
01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:04.170
after the man that the mainharvest reaps.

2035
01:40:04.170 --> 01:40:07.870
Loose now and then a scatter'dsmile,

2036
01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:09.130
and that I'll live upon.

2037
01:40:09.130 --> 01:40:11.970
Know'st now the youth that spoketo me erewhile?

2038
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:19.300
Not very well, but I have methim oft,

2039
01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:21.370
and he hath bought the cottageand the bounds

2040
01:40:21.370 --> 01:40:23.430
that the old carlot once wasmaster of.

2041
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:26.830
Think not I love him, though Iask for him.

2042
01:40:26.830 --> 01:40:29.130
'Tis but a peevish boy.

2043
01:40:29.130 --> 01:40:31.670
Yet he talks well.

2044
01:40:31.670 --> 01:40:34.930
But what care I for words?

2045
01:40:34.930 --> 01:40:38.200
Yet words do well when he thatspeaks them

2046
01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:41.470
pleases those that hear.

2047
01:40:41.470 --> 01:40:45.000
It is a pretty youth-- not verypretty--

2048
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.730
but, sure, he's proud,

2049
01:40:46.730 --> 01:40:48.830
and yet his pride becomes him.

2050
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:50.730
He'll make a proper man.

2051
01:40:50.730 --> 01:40:55.600
The best thing in him is hiscomplexion,

2052
01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.970
and faster than his tongue didmake offence,

2053
01:40:57.970 --> 01:41:00.130
his eye did heal it up.

2054
01:41:00.130 --> 01:41:01.330
He is not very tall.

2055
01:41:01.330 --> 01:41:04.170
Yet for his years, he's tall.

2056
01:41:04.170 --> 01:41:08.570
His leg is but so-so, and yet'tis well.

2057
01:41:08.570 --> 01:41:11.800
There was a pretty redness inhis lip,

2058
01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:14.930
a little riper and more lustyred than that mix'd in hischeek.

2059
01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:16.170
'Twas just the difference

2060
01:41:16.170 --> 01:41:21.130
betwixt the constant red andmingled damask.

2061
01:41:21.130 --> 01:41:22.630
There be some women, Silvius,

2062
01:41:22.630 --> 01:41:25.030
had they mark'd him in parcelsas I did,

2063
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:27.200
would have gone near to fall inlove with him,

2064
01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:30.800
but, for my part, I love him notnor hate him not,

2065
01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:35.270
and yet I have more cause tohate him than to love him.

2066
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:38.970
For what had he to do to chideat me?

2067
01:41:38.970 --> 01:41:44.530
He said mine eyes were black andmy hair black

2068
01:41:44.530 --> 01:41:47.300
and, now I am remember'd,scorn'd at me.

2069
01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:51.070
I marvel why I answer'd notagain.

2070
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:52.470
But that's all one.

2071
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:54.970
Omittance is no quittance.

2072
01:41:54.970 --> 01:41:57.030
I'll write to him a verytaunting letter,

2073
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:58.370
and thou shalt bear it.

2074
01:41:58.370 --> 01:41:59.470
Wilt thou, Silvius?

2075
01:41:59.470 --> 01:42:00.800
Phebe, with all my heart.

2076
01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:01.970
I'll write it straight.

2077
01:42:01.970 --> 01:42:03.500
Go with me, Silvius.

2078
01:42:10.170 --> 01:42:12.170
I prithee, pretty youth,

2079
01:42:12.170 --> 01:42:14.470
let me be better acquainted withthee.

2080
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:16.670
They say you are a melancholyfellow.

2081
01:42:16.670 --> 01:42:17.930
I am so.

2082
01:42:17.930 --> 01:42:20.300
I do love it better thanlaughing.

2083
01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:24.600
Those that are in extremity ofeither are abominable fellows

2084
01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:27.500
and betray themselves to everymodern censure

2085
01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:28.770
worse than drunkards.

2086
01:42:28.770 --> 01:42:30.900
Why, 'tis good to be sad and saynothing.

2087
01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:32.970
Why then, 'tis good to be apost.

2088
01:42:32.970 --> 01:42:35.030
I have neither the scholar'smelancholy,

2089
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:37.130
which is emulation;

2090
01:42:37.130 --> 01:42:40.130
nor the musician's, which isfantastical;

2091
01:42:40.130 --> 01:42:42.630
nor the courtier's, which isproud;

2092
01:42:42.630 --> 01:42:45.100
nor the soldier's, which isambitious;

2093
01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:48.030
nor the lawyer's, which ispolitic;

2094
01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:51.400
nor the lady's, which is nice;

2095
01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:56.200
nor the lover's, which is allthese;

2096
01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.870
but it is a melancholy of mineown,

2097
01:42:58.870 --> 01:43:01.870
compounded of many simples,

2098
01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:05.000
extracted from many objects,

2099
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.230
and, indeed, the sundrycontemplation of my travels,

2100
01:43:09.230 --> 01:43:12.300
in which my often rumination

2101
01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:17.070
wraps me in a most humoroussadness.

2102
01:43:17.070 --> 01:43:19.170
A traveller.

2103
01:43:19.170 --> 01:43:23.030
By my faith, you have greatreason to be sad.

2104
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:25.230
I fear you have sold your ownlands

2105
01:43:25.230 --> 01:43:26.670
to see other men's.

2106
01:43:26.670 --> 01:43:28.800
Then, to have seen much and tohave nothing,

2107
01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:31.270
is to have rich eyes and poorhands.

2108
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:33.730
Yes, I have gained myexperience.

2109
01:43:33.730 --> 01:43:35.930
And your experience makes yousad.

2110
01:43:35.930 --> 01:43:38.300
I'd rather have a fool to makeme merry

2111
01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:40.470
than experience to make me sad--

2112
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:42.330
and to travel for it too--

2113
01:43:42.330 --> 01:43:45.370
Good day and happiness, dearRosalind.

2114
01:43:45.370 --> 01:43:47.870
Nay, then, God by you, and youtalk in blank verse.

2115
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:49.470
Farewell, Monsieur Traveller.

2116
01:43:49.470 --> 01:43:52.500
Look you, lisp and wear strangesuits,

2117
01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:54.630
disable all the benefits of yourown country,

2118
01:43:54.630 --> 01:43:56.230
be out of love with yournativity,

2119
01:43:56.230 --> 01:43:58.670
and almost chide God for makingyou

2120
01:43:58.670 --> 01:44:00.170
that countenance you are,

2121
01:44:00.170 --> 01:44:03.570
or I will scarce think you haveswam in a gondola.

2122
01:44:03.570 --> 01:44:07.470
How now, Orlando.

2123
01:44:07.470 --> 01:44:10.230
Where have you been all thiswhile?

2124
01:44:10.230 --> 01:44:11.700
You, a lover,

2125
01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:13.430
and you serve me such anothertrick,

2126
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:14.730
never come in my sight more.

2127
01:44:14.730 --> 01:44:15.930
My fair Rosalind,

2128
01:44:15.930 --> 01:44:20.100
I come within an hour of mypromise.

2129
01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:22.900
Break an hour's promise in love?

2130
01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:26.800
He that will divide a minuteinto a thousand parts

2131
01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:28.030
and break but a part

2132
01:44:28.030 --> 01:44:30.900
of the thousandth part of aminute in the affairs of love,

2133
01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:32.130
it may be said of him

2134
01:44:32.130 --> 01:44:34.530
that Cupid hath clapped him o'erthe shoulder,

2135
01:44:34.530 --> 01:44:36.400
but I'll warrant himheart-whole.

2136
01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:39.500
Pardon me, dear Rosalind.

2137
01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:42.070
Nay, and you be so tardy,

2138
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:44.000
come no more in my sight.

2139
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.770
I had as lief be wooed of asnail.

2140
01:44:46.770 --> 01:44:48.000
Of a snail?

2141
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.230
Ay, of a snail,

2142
01:44:49.230 --> 01:44:50.570
for though he comes slowly,

2143
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:52.230
he carries his house on hishead--

2144
01:44:52.230 --> 01:44:53.630
a better jointure, I think,

2145
01:44:53.630 --> 01:44:55.570
than you make a woman.

2146
01:44:55.570 --> 01:44:58.800
Besides, he carries his destinywith him.

2147
01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:00.130
What's that?

2148
01:45:00.130 --> 01:45:02.670
Why, horns, which such as you

2149
01:45:02.670 --> 01:45:05.270
are fain to be beholding to yourwives for.

2150
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:06.800
Virtue is no horn maker,

2151
01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:09.200
and my Rosalind is virtuous.

2152
01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:11.930
And I am your Rosalind.

2153
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:14.130
It pleases him to call you so.

2154
01:45:14.130 --> 01:45:16.500
He hath a Rosalind of a betterleer than you.

2155
01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:23.030
Come, woo me, woo me,

2156
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:29.500
for now I am in a holiday humorand like enough to consent.

2157
01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:31.570
What would you say to me now,

2158
01:45:31.570 --> 01:45:36.170
an I were your very, veryRosalind?

2159
01:45:36.170 --> 01:45:38.030
I would kiss before I spoke.

2160
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:40.770
Nay, you were better to speakfirst,

2161
01:45:40.770 --> 01:45:42.970
and when you were gravelled forlack of matter,

2162
01:45:42.970 --> 01:45:45.070
then you might take occasion tokiss.

2163
01:45:45.070 --> 01:45:47.400
Very good orators, when they areout, they spit,

2164
01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:49.830
and for lovers lacking-- Godwarn us--matter,

2165
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:52.300
the cleanliest shift is to kiss.

2166
01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:54.300
How if the kiss be denied?

2167
01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:57.000
Then she puts you to entreaty,and there begins new matter.

2168
01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.300
What, of my suit?

2169
01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:02.170
Not out of your apparel, and yetout of your suit.

2170
01:46:02.170 --> 01:46:04.900
Am not I your Rosalind?

2171
01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:06.670
I take some joy to say you are,

2172
01:46:06.670 --> 01:46:09.800
because I would be talking ofher.

2173
01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:14.070
Well then, in her person,

2174
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:16.300
I say I will not have you.

2175
01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:19.900
Then, in mine own person, I die.

2176
01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:25.630
No, faith, die by attorney.

2177
01:46:25.630 --> 01:46:29.170
The poor world is almost 6,000years old,

2178
01:46:29.170 --> 01:46:30.700
and in all that time,

2179
01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:33.800
there was not any man died inhis own person,

2180
01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:36.170
videlicet, in a love-cause.

2181
01:46:36.170 --> 01:46:39.130
Troilus had his brains dashedout with a Grecian club,

2182
01:46:39.130 --> 01:46:41.170
although he did what he could todie before,

2183
01:46:41.170 --> 01:46:43.930
and he is one of the verypatterns of love.

2184
01:46:43.930 --> 01:46:47.330
Leander, he would have lived formany a fair year,

2185
01:46:47.330 --> 01:46:48.630
though Hero had turned nun,

2186
01:46:48.630 --> 01:46:50.930
had it not been for a hotmidsummer night,

2187
01:46:50.930 --> 01:46:52.900
for, good youth, he went butforth

2188
01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:54.270
to wash him in the Hellespont

2189
01:46:54.270 --> 01:46:57.170
and there being taken of a crampwas drowned,

2190
01:46:57.170 --> 01:46:59.000
and the foolish chronicles ofthat age

2191
01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.400
did find it "Hero of Sestos."

2192
01:47:02.930 --> 01:47:05.200
But these are all lies.

2193
01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:08.630
Men have died from time to time,

2194
01:47:08.630 --> 01:47:12.130
and worms have eaten them, butnot for love.

2195
01:47:12.130 --> 01:47:14.700
I would not have my rightRosalind of this mind,

2196
01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:17.370
for, I protest, her frown mightkill me.

2197
01:47:17.370 --> 01:47:22.170
By this hand, it will not kill afly.

2198
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:26.400
But come,

2199
01:47:28.930 --> 01:47:31.970
now I will be your Rosalind

2200
01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:36.400
in a more coming-on disposition,

2201
01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:38.070
and ask me what you will.

2202
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:39.600
I will grant it.

2203
01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:43.070
Then love me, Rosalind.

2204
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:49.630
Yes, faith, will I, Fridays andSaturdays and all.

2205
01:47:49.630 --> 01:47:51.300
And wilt thou have me?

2206
01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:53.570
Aye, and 20 such.

2207
01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:55.970
What sayest thou?

2208
01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:57.100
Are you not good?

2209
01:47:57.100 --> 01:47:58.230
I hope so.

2210
01:47:58.230 --> 01:48:00.230
Why, can one desire too much ofa good thing?

2211
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:08.400
Come, sister, you must be thepriest and marry us.

2212
01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:10.070
Give me your hand, Orlando.

2213
01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:17.670
Well, sister, what do you say?

2214
01:48:17.670 --> 01:48:18.900
Pray thee, marry us.

2215
01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:20.270
Well, I cannot say the words.

2216
01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:24.000
You must begin, "Will you,Orlando"--

2217
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.500
Go to.

2218
01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:33.930
Will you, Orlando, have to wifethis Rosalind?

2219
01:48:33.930 --> 01:48:35.170
I will.

2220
01:48:35.170 --> 01:48:36.370
Aye, but when?

2221
01:48:36.370 --> 01:48:38.030
Why now; as fast as she canmarry us.

2222
01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:39.630
Why, then, you must say,

2223
01:48:39.630 --> 01:48:43.800
"'I take thee, Rosalind, forwife."

2224
01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:50.000
I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.

2225
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.730
I might ask you for yourcommission,

2226
01:48:51.730 --> 01:48:59.400
but I do take thee, Orlando, formy husband.

2227
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:02.400
Oh.

2228
01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:04.830
There's a girl goes before thepriest,

2229
01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:07.530
and certainly a woman's thoughtruns before her actions.

2230
01:49:07.530 --> 01:49:08.530
So do all thoughts.

2231
01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:11.300
They are winged.

2232
01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:19.200
How long would you have herafter you have possessed her?

2233
01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:21.370
Forever and a day.

2234
01:49:21.370 --> 01:49:24.470
Say the "day" without the"ever."

2235
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:26.730
No, no,

2236
01:49:26.730 --> 01:49:29.530
Orlando, men are April when theywoo,

2237
01:49:29.530 --> 01:49:31.100
December when they wed.

2238
01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:33.530
Maids are May when they aremaids,

2239
01:49:33.530 --> 01:49:38.330
but the sky changes when theyare wives.

2240
01:49:38.330 --> 01:49:41.330
I will be more jealous of thee

2241
01:49:41.330 --> 01:49:43.870
than a Barbary cock-pigeon overhis hen,

2242
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:46.230
more clamorous than a parrotagainst rain,

2243
01:49:46.230 --> 01:49:48.270
more new-fangled than an ape,

2244
01:49:48.270 --> 01:49:50.570
more giddy in my desires than amonkey.

2245
01:49:50.570 --> 01:49:54.870
I will weep for nothing, likeDiana in the fountain,

2246
01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:59.000
and I will do that when you aredisposed to be merry.

2247
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.730
I will laugh like a hyena,

2248
01:50:02.730 --> 01:50:05.370
and that when you are inclinedto sleep.

2249
01:50:05.370 --> 01:50:07.130
But will my Rosalind do so?

2250
01:50:07.130 --> 01:50:09.570
By my life, she will do as I do.

2251
01:50:09.570 --> 01:50:11.130
O, but she is wise.

2252
01:50:11.130 --> 01:50:13.800
Else she would not have the witto do this.

2253
01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:15.330
The wiser, the waywarder.

2254
01:50:15.330 --> 01:50:16.970
Make the doors upon a woman'swit,

2255
01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:18.500
and it will out at the casement.

2256
01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:20.800
Shut that, 'twill out throughthe keyhole.

2257
01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:22.370
Stop that,

2258
01:50:22.370 --> 01:50:25.630
'twill fly with the smoke out ofthe chimney.

2259
01:50:25.630 --> 01:50:30.200
For these two hours, Rosalind, Iwill leave thee.

2260
01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:33.830
Alas, dear love, I cannot lackthee two hours.

2261
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:35.400
I must attend the duke atdinner.

2262
01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:37.330
By two o'clock, I will be withthee again.

2263
01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:40.670
Well...

2264
01:50:40.670 --> 01:50:44.630
go your ways, go your ways.

2265
01:50:44.630 --> 01:50:46.600
I knew what you would prove.

2266
01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:50.970
My friends told me as such, andI-I-I thought no less:

2267
01:50:50.970 --> 01:50:54.270
'Twas that flattering tongue ofyours won me.

2268
01:50:55.770 --> 01:51:01.900
Well, 'tis but one cast off, andso, come, death!

2269
01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:03.170
Two o'clock is your hour?

2270
01:51:03.170 --> 01:51:04.870
Aye, sweet Rosalind.

2271
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:07.270
By my troth, and so God mend me,

2272
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:10.030
and by all pretty oaths that arenot dangerous,

2273
01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:12.730
if you break one jot of yourpromise

2274
01:51:12.730 --> 01:51:14.500
or come one minute behind yourhour,

2275
01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:17.170
I will think you the mostpathetical break-promise,

2276
01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:18.730
the most hollow lover,

2277
01:51:18.730 --> 01:51:21.070
and the most unworthy of her youthat call Rosalind

2278
01:51:21.070 --> 01:51:23.930
that may be chosen out of thegross band of the unfaithful,

2279
01:51:23.930 --> 01:51:26.570
and so, beware my censure,

2280
01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:28.800
and keep your promise.

2281
01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:30.930
With no less religion

2282
01:51:30.930 --> 01:51:34.830
than if thou wert indeed myRosalind.

2283
01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:36.600
So, adieu.

2284
01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:43.700
Well, Time is the old justicethat examines all suchoffenders,

2285
01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:46.070
and let Time try. Adieu.

2286
01:52:02.530 --> 01:52:06.570
You have simply misused our sexin your love-prate.

2287
01:52:06.570 --> 01:52:08.170
We must have your doublet andhose

2288
01:52:08.170 --> 01:52:09.570
plucked over your head

2289
01:52:09.570 --> 01:52:12.270
to show the world what the birdhath done to her own nest.

2290
01:52:12.270 --> 01:52:19.830
O coz, coz, coz,

2291
01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:23.170
my pretty little coz,

2292
01:52:23.170 --> 01:52:24.730
if thou didst know

2293
01:52:24.730 --> 01:52:30.830
how many fathom deep I am inlove.

2294
01:52:30.830 --> 01:52:33.330
But it cannot be sounded.

2295
01:52:33.330 --> 01:52:37.170
My affection hath an unknownbottom,

2296
01:52:37.170 --> 01:52:39.200
like the bay of Portugal.

2297
01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:41.200
Or rather, bottomless,

2298
01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:43.100
for as fast as you pouraffection in,

2299
01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:44.400
it runs out.

2300
01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:48.900
No, that same wicked bastard ofVenus

2301
01:52:48.900 --> 01:52:51.070
that was begot of thought,

2302
01:52:51.070 --> 01:52:54.000
conceived of spleen, and born ofmadness,

2303
01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.670
that blind rascally boy

2304
01:52:56.670 --> 01:52:59.400
that abuses every one's eyesbecause his own are out,

2305
01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:05.500
let him be judge how deep I amin love.

2306
01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:09.470
Oh...

2307
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:11.830
I tell thee, Aliena,

2308
01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:15.930
I cannot be out of the sight ofOrlando.

2309
01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:24.630
I'll go find a shadow and sighuntil he come.

2310
01:53:24.630 --> 01:53:26.370
And I'll sleep.

2311
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.600
Which is he that killed thedeer?

2312
01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:41.700
Sir, it was I.

2313
01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:44.530
Let's present him to the duke,like a Roman conqueror,

2314
01:53:44.530 --> 01:53:45.800
and it would do well

2315
01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:47.700
to set the deer's horns upon hishead

2316
01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:49.130
for a branch of victory.

2317
01:53:49.130 --> 01:53:51.270
Have you no song, forester, forthis purpose?

2318
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:52.370
Yes, sir.

2319
01:53:52.370 --> 01:53:53.500
Sing it!

2320
01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:55.000
'Tis no matter how it be in tune

2321
01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.700
so it make noise enough.

2322
01:53:56.700 --> 01:54:00.830
What shall he have that kill'dthe deer?

2323
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:03.330
His leather skin and horns towear.

2324
01:54:03.330 --> 01:54:05.930
Then sing him home.

2325
01:54:05.930 --> 01:54:08.570
Take thou no scorn to wear thehorn;

2326
01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:11.230
It was a crest ere thou wastborn.

2327
01:54:11.230 --> 01:54:14.100
Thy father's father wore it,

2328
01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:16.500
and thy father bore it.

2329
01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:19.170
The horn, the horn, the lustyhorn

2330
01:54:19.170 --> 01:54:24.030
is not a thing to laugh toscorn.

2331
01:54:24.030 --> 01:54:25.370
How say you now?

2332
01:54:25.370 --> 01:54:26.630
Is it not past two o'clock?

2333
01:54:26.630 --> 01:54:29.070
And here much Orlando.

2334
01:54:29.070 --> 01:54:30.300
I warrant you,

2335
01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:32.500
with pure love and with troubledbrain,

2336
01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:37.900
he hath ta'en his bow and arrowsand is gone forth to sleep.

2337
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.030
My errand is to you, fair youth;

2338
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:46.700
My gentle Phebe did bid me giveyou this.

2339
01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:49.070
I know not the contents, but, asI guess

2340
01:54:49.070 --> 01:54:51.500
by the stern brow and waspishaction

2341
01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:53.400
that she did use as she waswriting of it,

2342
01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:56.970
it bears an angry tenor.

2343
01:54:56.970 --> 01:54:58.430
pardon me:

2344
01:54:58.430 --> 01:55:01.730
I am but as a guiltlessmessenger.

2345
01:55:01.730 --> 01:55:04.330
Patience herself would startleat this letter

2346
01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:05.670
and play the swaggerer.

2347
01:55:05.670 --> 01:55:08.500
Bear this, bear all.

2348
01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:10.670
She says I am not fair, that Ilack manners.

2349
01:55:10.670 --> 01:55:13.130
She calls me proud and that shecould not love me

2350
01:55:13.130 --> 01:55:16.230
were man as rare as phoenix.

2351
01:55:16.230 --> 01:55:17.900
'Od's my will.

2352
01:55:17.900 --> 01:55:20.970
Her love is not the hare that Ido hunt.

2353
01:55:20.970 --> 01:55:23.370
Why writes she this to me?

2354
01:55:23.370 --> 01:55:26.030
Well, shepherd, well,

2355
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:28.230
this is a letter of your owndevice.

2356
01:55:28.230 --> 01:55:32.470
No, I protest, I know not thecontents.

2357
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:33.930
Phebe did write it.

2358
01:55:33.930 --> 01:55:36.300
Come, come, you are a fool

2359
01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:39.100
and turn'd into the extremity oflove.

2360
01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:40.300
I saw her hand.

2361
01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:41.570
She has a leathern hand,

2362
01:55:41.570 --> 01:55:44.370
a freestone-color'd hand.

2363
01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:46.900
I verily did think that her oldgloves were on,

2364
01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:48.870
but 'twas her hands.

2365
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:52.400
She has a huswife's hand; but'tis no matter.

2366
01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:54.670
I say she never did invent thisletter.

2367
01:55:54.670 --> 01:55:57.900
this is a man's invention andhis hand.

2368
01:55:57.900 --> 01:55:59.100
Sure, it is hers.

2369
01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:03.330
Why, 'tis a boisterous and acruel style.

2370
01:56:03.330 --> 01:56:04.870
A style for challengers.

2371
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:08.130
Why, she defies me as Turk toChristian.

2372
01:56:08.130 --> 01:56:09.430
Will you hear the letter?

2373
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:11.970
So please you, for I never heardit yet,

2374
01:56:11.970 --> 01:56:14.770
yet heard too much of Phebe'scruelty.

2375
01:56:14.770 --> 01:56:17.200
She Phebes me.

2376
01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:19.030
Mark how the tyrant writes.

2377
01:56:21.370 --> 01:56:23.430
"Art thou god to shepherdturn'd,

2378
01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:25.470
that a maiden's heart hathburn'd?"

2379
01:56:25.470 --> 01:56:26.770
Can a woman rail thus?

2380
01:56:26.770 --> 01:56:29.600
Call you this railing?

2381
01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:31.700
"Why, thy godhead laid apart,

2382
01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:34.400
warr'st thou with a woman'sheart?"

2383
01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:37.930
Did you ever hear such railing?

2384
01:56:37.930 --> 01:56:40.730
"Whiles the eye of man did woome,

2385
01:56:40.730 --> 01:56:42.600
"that could do no vengeance tome.

2386
01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:47.100
"Whiles you chid me, I did love.

2387
01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:49.430
"How then might your prayersmove?

2388
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:51.730
"He that brings this love tothee

2389
01:56:51.730 --> 01:56:54.470
"little knows this love in me,

2390
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:57.000
"and by him, seal up thy mind

2391
01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.930
"whether that thy youth and kind

2392
01:56:58.930 --> 01:57:01.000
"will the faithful offer take ofme

2393
01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.300
"and all that I can make,

2394
01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:05.400
"or else by him, my love deny,

2395
01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:09.530
and then I'll study how to die."

2396
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:13.130
Call you this chiding?

2397
01:57:13.130 --> 01:57:14.930
Alas, poor shepherd.

2398
01:57:14.930 --> 01:57:16.730
Do you pity him?

2399
01:57:16.730 --> 01:57:19.230
No, he deserves no pity.

2400
01:57:19.230 --> 01:57:21.200
Wilt thou love such a woman?

2401
01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:23.170
What, to make of thee aninstrument

2402
01:57:23.170 --> 01:57:26.200
and play false strains uponthee?

2403
01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:30.230
Not to be endured.

2404
01:57:30.230 --> 01:57:33.500
Well, go thy ways to her,

2405
01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:37.270
for I see love hath made thee atame snake,

2406
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:38.900
and say this to her.

2407
01:57:38.900 --> 01:57:41.430
If she love me, I charge her tolove thee.

2408
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:43.470
If she will not, I will neverhave her

2409
01:57:43.470 --> 01:57:45.670
unless thou entreat for her.

2410
01:57:45.670 --> 01:57:48.070
If you be a true lover, hence,

2411
01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:51.070
and not a word,

2412
01:57:51.070 --> 01:57:52.500
for here comes more company.

2413
01:57:55.370 --> 01:57:57.730
Good morrow, fair ones.

2414
01:57:57.730 --> 01:57:59.300
Pray you, if you know,

2415
01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:01.130
where in the purlieus of thisforest

2416
01:58:01.130 --> 01:58:03.530
stands a sheep-cote fenced aboutwith olive trees?

2417
01:58:03.530 --> 01:58:08.570
West of this place, down in theneighbour bottom.

2418
01:58:08.570 --> 01:58:11.100
A rank of osiers by themurmuring stream

2419
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:15.070
left on your right hand bringsyou to the place.

2420
01:58:15.070 --> 01:58:17.670
But at this hour the house dothkeep itself.

2421
01:58:17.670 --> 01:58:19.970
There is none within.

2422
01:58:19.970 --> 01:58:22.170
If that an eye may profit by atongue,

2423
01:58:22.170 --> 01:58:24.730
then should I know you bydescription.

2424
01:58:24.730 --> 01:58:28.100
Such garments and such years--

2425
01:58:28.100 --> 01:58:30.570
"The boy is fair, of femalefavor,

2426
01:58:30.570 --> 01:58:32.530
"and bestows himself like a ripesister;

2427
01:58:32.530 --> 01:58:35.730
the woman low and browner thanher brother."

2428
01:58:35.730 --> 01:58:38.370
Are not you the owner of thehouse I did inquire for?

2429
01:58:38.370 --> 01:58:42.230
It is no boast, being ask'd, tosay we are.

2430
01:58:42.230 --> 01:58:44.830
Orlando doth commend him to youboth,

2431
01:58:44.830 --> 01:58:47.100
and to that youth he calls hisRosalind

2432
01:58:47.100 --> 01:58:48.470
he sends this bloody napkin.

2433
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:49.630
Are you he?

2434
01:58:49.630 --> 01:58:50.770
I am.

2435
01:58:50.770 --> 01:58:52.300
What must we understand by this?

2436
01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:54.370
Some of my shame.

2437
01:58:54.370 --> 01:58:56.170
If you will know of me what manI am

2438
01:58:56.170 --> 01:58:59.170
and how and where and why thishandkercher was stain'd.

2439
01:58:59.170 --> 01:59:01.070
I pray you, tell it.

2440
01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:03.900
When last the young Orlandoparted from you,

2441
01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:06.700
he left a promise to returnagain within an hour,

2442
01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:08.200
and pacing through the forest,

2443
01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:10.570
chewing the food of sweet andbitter fancy,

2444
01:59:10.570 --> 01:59:12.430
lo, what befell.

2445
01:59:12.430 --> 01:59:13.870
He threw his eye aside,

2446
01:59:13.870 --> 01:59:17.370
and mark what object did presentitself.

2447
01:59:17.370 --> 01:59:20.400
Under an oak whose boughs weremoss'd with age

2448
01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:22.530
and high top bald with dryantiquity,

2449
01:59:22.530 --> 01:59:24.500
A wretched ragged man o'ergrownwith hair

2450
01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:26.930
lay sleeping on his back.

2451
01:59:26.930 --> 01:59:28.070
About his neck,

2452
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:30.900
a green and gilded snake hadwreathed itself

2453
01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:32.570
who with her head nimble inthreats

2454
01:59:32.570 --> 01:59:34.330
approach'd the opening of hismouth,

2455
01:59:34.330 --> 01:59:36.700
but suddenly, seeing Orlando, itunlink'd itself

2456
01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:40.370
and with indented glides didslip away into a bush,

2457
01:59:40.370 --> 01:59:42.700
under which bush's shade,

2458
01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:45.300
a lioness with udders all drawndry lay couching,

2459
01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:47.500
head on ground with catlikewatch,

2460
01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:49.800
when that the sleeping manshould stir,

2461
01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:51.870
for 'tis the royal dispositionof that beast

2462
01:59:51.870 --> 01:59:55.230
to prey on nothing that dothseem as dead.

2463
01:59:55.230 --> 01:59:57.330
This seen, Orlando did approachthe man

2464
01:59:57.330 --> 01:59:59.870
and found it was his brother,his elder brother.

2465
01:59:59.870 --> 02:00:02.000
O, I have heard him speak ofthat same brother,

2466
02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.900
and he did render him the mostunnatural amongst men.

2467
02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:07.230
And well he might so do,

2468
02:00:07.230 --> 02:00:09.030
for well I know he wasunnatural.

2469
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:11.500
But to Orlando, did he leave himthere,

2470
02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:13.930
food to the suck'd and hungrylioness?

2471
02:00:13.930 --> 02:00:16.930
Twice did he turn his back andpurposed so,

2472
02:00:16.930 --> 02:00:19.170
but kindness, nobler ever thanrevenge,

2473
02:00:19.170 --> 02:00:21.770
and nature, stronger than hisjust occasion,

2474
02:00:21.770 --> 02:00:23.570
made him give battle to thelioness,

2475
02:00:23.570 --> 02:00:25.100
who quickly fell before him

2476
02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:30.470
in which hurtling from miserableslumber,

2477
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:32.170
I awaked.

2478
02:00:32.170 --> 02:00:33.430
Are you his brother?

2479
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:34.700
Wast you he rescued?

2480
02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:37.000
Was't you that did so oftcontrive to kill him?

2481
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.830
'Twas I, but 'tis not I.

2482
02:00:38.830 --> 02:00:40.630
I do not shame to tell you whatI was,

2483
02:00:40.630 --> 02:00:42.700
since my conversion so sweetlytastes,

2484
02:00:42.700 --> 02:00:44.030
being the thing I am.

2485
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:45.570
But, for the bloody napkin?

2486
02:00:45.570 --> 02:00:47.170
By and by.

2487
02:00:47.170 --> 02:00:49.630
When from the first and last,betwixt us two,

2488
02:00:49.630 --> 02:00:52.270
tears our recountments had mostkindly bathed

2489
02:00:52.270 --> 02:00:54.030
as how I came into that desertplace--

2490
02:00:54.030 --> 02:00:55.800
in brief, he led me to thegentle duke,

2491
02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:57.830
who gave me fresh array andentertainment,

2492
02:00:57.830 --> 02:01:00.170
committing me unto my brother'slove,

2493
02:01:00.170 --> 02:01:02.370
who led me instantly unto hiscave,

2494
02:01:02.370 --> 02:01:03.670
there stripp'd himself,

2495
02:01:03.670 --> 02:01:05.000
and here, upon his arm,

2496
02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:06.830
the lioness had torn some fleshaway,

2497
02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:08.530
which all this while had bled,

2498
02:01:08.530 --> 02:01:10.430
and now he fainted

2499
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:13.530
and cried, in fainting, uponRosalind.

2500
02:01:13.530 --> 02:01:15.670
Brief, I recover'd him, bound uphis wound,

2501
02:01:15.670 --> 02:01:18.200
and, after some small space,being strong at heart,

2502
02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:20.630
he sent me hither, stranger as Iam,

2503
02:01:20.630 --> 02:01:22.400
to tell this story

2504
02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:24.330
that you might excuse his brokenpromise

2505
02:01:24.330 --> 02:01:26.200
and to give this napkin dyed inhis blood

2506
02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:30.200
unto that shepherd youth that hein sport doth call his Rosalind.

2507
02:01:33.330 --> 02:01:35.930
Why, how now, Ganymede,

2508
02:01:35.930 --> 02:01:37.070
sweet Ganymede.

2509
02:01:37.070 --> 02:01:39.300
Many will swoon when they dolook on blood.

2510
02:01:39.300 --> 02:01:42.000
There is more in it.

2511
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.800
Cousin Ganymede.

2512
02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:44.970
Look, he recovers.

2513
02:01:44.970 --> 02:01:47.730
Oh.

2514
02:01:47.730 --> 02:01:49.270
Would I were at home.

2515
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:51.230
We'll lead you thither.

2516
02:01:51.230 --> 02:01:54.300
I pray you, will you take him bythe arm?

2517
02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:55.770
Be of good cheer.

2518
02:01:55.770 --> 02:01:58.770
Wert you a man, you lack a man'sheart.

2519
02:01:58.770 --> 02:02:02.170
I do so, I confess it.

2520
02:02:02.170 --> 02:02:05.600
Ah, ah, ha, ha, sirrah,

2521
02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:07.830
a body would think this was wellcounterfeited.

2522
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:11.330
I pray you, tell your brotherhow well I counterfeited.

2523
02:02:11.330 --> 02:02:12.500
Ah!

2524
02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:14.530
This was not a counterfeit.

2525
02:02:14.530 --> 02:02:16.900
There is too great testimony inyour complexion

2526
02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:18.770
that it was a passion ofearnest.

2527
02:02:18.770 --> 02:02:20.500
Counterfeit, I assure you.

2528
02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:23.500
Well then, take a good heart andcounterfeit to be a man.

2529
02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:25.000
Oh.

2530
02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.870
So I do,

2531
02:02:27.870 --> 02:02:29.870
but, in faith,

2532
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:32.530
I should have been a woman byright.

2533
02:02:32.530 --> 02:02:35.000
Come, you look paler and paler.

2534
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:36.700
I pray you, draw homeward.

2535
02:02:36.700 --> 02:02:39.130
Good sir, go with us.

2536
02:02:42.170 --> 02:02:43.900
Will you go?

2537
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.800
We shall find a time, Audrey.

2538
02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:57.600
Patience, gentle Audrey.

2539
02:02:57.600 --> 02:02:59.270
Faith, the priest was goodenough,

2540
02:02:59.270 --> 02:03:01.430
for all the old gentleman'ssaying.

2541
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:03.470
A most wicked Sir Oliver,Audrey,

2542
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:05.270
a most vile Martext.

2543
02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:13.570
But, Audrey, there is a youthhere in the forest

2544
02:03:13.570 --> 02:03:14.800
lays claim to you.

2545
02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:16.270
Aye, I know who 'tis.

2546
02:03:16.270 --> 02:03:19.470
He hath no interest in me in theworld.

2547
02:03:19.470 --> 02:03:20.930
Here comes the man you mean.

2548
02:03:20.930 --> 02:03:22.770
It is meat and drink to me tosee a clown.

2549
02:03:22.770 --> 02:03:24.370
By my troth, we that have goodwits

2550
02:03:24.370 --> 02:03:25.870
have much to answer for.

2551
02:03:25.870 --> 02:03:28.330
We shall be flouting; we cannothold.

2552
02:03:28.330 --> 02:03:29.530
Good even, Audrey.

2553
02:03:29.530 --> 02:03:31.200
God ye good even, William.

2554
02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:32.700
And good even to you, sir.

2555
02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:34.000
Good even, gentle friend.

2556
02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.470
Cover thy head, cover thy head.

2557
02:03:35.470 --> 02:03:36.800
Nay, prithee, be covered.

2558
02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:39.170
How old are you, friend?

2559
02:03:39.170 --> 02:03:40.370
F...

2560
02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:41.900
Five and twenty, sir.

2561
02:03:41.900 --> 02:03:43.300
A ripe age.

2562
02:03:43.300 --> 02:03:44.730
Is thy name William?

2563
02:03:44.730 --> 02:03:45.830
William, sir.

2564
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:46.930
A fair name.

2565
02:03:46.930 --> 02:03:48.370
Wast born i' the forest here?

2566
02:03:48.370 --> 02:03:49.600
Ay, sir, I thank God.

2567
02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:51.030
"Thank God"--a good answer.

2568
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:52.170
Art rich?

2569
02:03:52.170 --> 02:03:54.570
Faith, sir, so-so.

2570
02:03:54.570 --> 02:03:57.270
"So-so" is good, very good, veryexcellent good,

2571
02:03:57.270 --> 02:03:58.570
and yet it is not.

2572
02:03:58.570 --> 02:04:00.070
It is but so-so.

2573
02:04:00.070 --> 02:04:01.200
Art thou wise?

2574
02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:02.870
Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.

2575
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:04.070
Why, thou sayest well.

2576
02:04:04.070 --> 02:04:05.530
You do love this maid.

2577
02:04:05.530 --> 02:04:06.630
I do, sir.

2578
02:04:06.630 --> 02:04:07.770
Give me your hand.

2579
02:04:12.970 --> 02:04:14.200
Art thou learned?

2580
02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:15.300
No, sir.

2581
02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:17.870
Then learn this of me.

2582
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:19.470
To have is to have,

2583
02:04:19.470 --> 02:04:21.830
for it is a figure in rhetoricthat drink,

2584
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:24.070
being poured out of a cup into aglass,

2585
02:04:24.070 --> 02:04:27.270
by filling the one doth emptythe other,

2586
02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:30.630
for all your writers do consentthat ipse is he.

2587
02:04:30.630 --> 02:04:34.300
Now, you are not ipse.

2588
02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:35.430
I am he.

2589
02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:39.800
Which he, sir?

2590
02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:42.330
He, sir, that must marry thiswoman.

2591
02:04:42.330 --> 02:04:44.570
Therefore, you clown, abandon--

2592
02:04:44.570 --> 02:04:46.100
which is in the vulgar "leave"--

2593
02:04:46.100 --> 02:04:48.430
the society--which in theboorish is "company"--

2594
02:04:48.430 --> 02:04:50.730
of this female-- which in thecommon is "woman"--

2595
02:04:50.730 --> 02:04:51.930
which together is

2596
02:04:51.930 --> 02:04:53.700
abandon the society of thisfemale,

2597
02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:55.670
or, clown, thou perishest;

2598
02:04:55.670 --> 02:04:58.670
or, to thy better understanding,diest;

2599
02:04:58.670 --> 02:05:00.400
or, to wit, I kill thee;

2600
02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:01.600
make thee away,

2601
02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:03.100
translate thy life into death,

2602
02:05:03.100 --> 02:05:04.570
thy liberty into bondage.

2603
02:05:04.570 --> 02:05:08.400
I will deal in poison with theeor in bastinado or in steel.

2604
02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:10.270
I will bandy with thee infaction.

2605
02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:11.900
I will o'errun thee with policy.

2606
02:05:11.900 --> 02:05:15.930
I will kill you a hundred andfifty ways!

2607
02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:19.770
Therefore, tremble and depart!

2608
02:05:19.770 --> 02:05:21.130
Do, good William.

2609
02:05:21.130 --> 02:05:23.170
God rest you merry, sir.

2610
02:05:23.170 --> 02:05:26.670
Ah! Oh, Ee-yah!

2611
02:05:26.670 --> 02:05:29.000
Our master and mistress seeksyou.

2612
02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.470
Come, away, away.

2613
02:05:31.470 --> 02:05:36.470
Trip, Audrey. Trip, Audrey.

2614
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:38.630
I attend. I attend.

2615
02:05:42.030 --> 02:05:44.900
Is't possible that on so littleacquaintance

2616
02:05:44.900 --> 02:05:46.170
you should like her?

2617
02:05:46.170 --> 02:05:47.930
That but seeing, you should loveher?

2618
02:05:47.930 --> 02:05:49.370
And loving, woo?

2619
02:05:49.370 --> 02:05:51.370
And wooing, she should grant?

2620
02:05:51.370 --> 02:05:53.230
And will you persever to enjoyher?

2621
02:05:53.230 --> 02:05:55.370
Neither call the giddiness of itin question,

2622
02:05:55.370 --> 02:05:57.700
nor the poverty of her, thesmall acquaintance,

2623
02:05:57.700 --> 02:06:01.000
nor my sudden wooing, nor hersudden consenting;

2624
02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.570
but say with me, I love Aliena.

2625
02:06:04.570 --> 02:06:06.530
Say with her that she loves me.

2626
02:06:06.530 --> 02:06:09.370
Consent to it both that we mayenjoy each other.

2627
02:06:09.370 --> 02:06:11.930
It shall be to your good,

2628
02:06:11.930 --> 02:06:14.130
for my father's house and allthe revenue

2629
02:06:14.130 --> 02:06:17.000
that was old Sir Rowland's willI bestow upon you

2630
02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.500
and here live and die ashepherd.

2631
02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:21.600
You have my consent.

2632
02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:23.070
Let your wedding be tomorrow.

2633
02:06:23.070 --> 02:06:26.870
Thither will I invite the dukeand all's contented followers.

2634
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:29.130
Go you, and prepare Aliena,

2635
02:06:29.130 --> 02:06:30.500
for look you,

2636
02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:32.130
here comes my Rosalind.

2637
02:06:32.130 --> 02:06:34.070
God save you, brother.

2638
02:06:34.070 --> 02:06:37.270
And you, fair sister.

2639
02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:43.830
O, my dear Orlando,

2640
02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:46.930
how it grieves me to see theewear thy heart in a scarf.

2641
02:06:46.930 --> 02:06:48.700
It is my arm.

2642
02:06:48.700 --> 02:06:50.770
I thought thy heart had beenwounded

2643
02:06:50.770 --> 02:06:52.370
with the claws of a lion.

2644
02:06:52.370 --> 02:06:55.470
Wounded it is, but with the eyesof a lady.

2645
02:06:55.470 --> 02:07:00.100
Did your brother tell you how Icounterfeited to swoon

2646
02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:02.400
when he showed me yourhandkerchief?

2647
02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:05.070
Aye, and greater wonders thanthat.

2648
02:07:05.070 --> 02:07:08.600
O, I know where you are.

2649
02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:11.300
Nay, 'tis true.

2650
02:07:11.300 --> 02:07:12.970
There was never anything sosudden

2651
02:07:12.970 --> 02:07:14.930
as the fight of two rams

2652
02:07:14.930 --> 02:07:20.330
or Caesar's thrasonical brag of"I came, saw, and overcame,"

2653
02:07:20.330 --> 02:07:26.700
for your brother and my sisterno sooner met but they looked,

2654
02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:30.330
no sooner looked but they loved,

2655
02:07:30.330 --> 02:07:32.100
no sooner loved but they sighed,

2656
02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:34.800
no sooner sighed but they askedone another the reason,

2657
02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:37.870
no sooner knew the reason butthey sought the remedy;

2658
02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:39.270
and in these degrees

2659
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:42.800
have they made a pair of stairsto marriage

2660
02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:45.170
which they will climbincontinent

2661
02:07:45.170 --> 02:07:47.600
or else be incontinent beforemarriage.

2662
02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:52.230
They are in the very wrath oflove,

2663
02:07:52.230 --> 02:07:55.430
and they will together.

2664
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:57.130
Clubs cannot part them.

2665
02:07:58.370 --> 02:08:00.800
They shall be married tomorrow,

2666
02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:04.100
and I will bid the duke to thenuptial,

2667
02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:05.770
but, O, how bitter a thing it is

2668
02:08:05.770 --> 02:08:08.830
to look into happiness throughanother man's eyes.

2669
02:08:08.830 --> 02:08:10.830
By so much the more shall Itomorrow

2670
02:08:10.830 --> 02:08:12.600
be at the height ofheart-heaviness

2671
02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:14.830
by how much I shall think mybrother happy

2672
02:08:14.830 --> 02:08:17.000
in having what he wishes for.

2673
02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:20.100
Why then, tomorrow I cannotserve your turn for Rosalind?

2674
02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:25.300
I can live no longer bythinking.

2675
02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:32.870
I will weary you then no longerwith idle talking.

2676
02:08:32.870 --> 02:08:38.130
Know of me then, I can dostrange things.

2677
02:08:38.130 --> 02:08:40.600
I have, since I was three yearold,

2678
02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:42.270
conversed with a magician

2679
02:08:42.270 --> 02:08:48.430
most profound in his art and yetnot damnable.

2680
02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:50.800
If you do love Rosalind

2681
02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:54.970
so near the heart as yourgesture cries it out,

2682
02:08:54.970 --> 02:08:57.330
when your brother marriesAliena,

2683
02:08:57.330 --> 02:09:00.770
shall you marry her.

2684
02:09:00.770 --> 02:09:03.830
I know into what straits offortune she is driven,

2685
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:05.800
and it is not impossible to me,

2686
02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:10.970
if it appear not inconvenient toyou,

2687
02:09:10.970 --> 02:09:14.070
to set her before your eyestomorrow,

2688
02:09:14.070 --> 02:09:19.600
human as she is and without anydanger.

2689
02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:21.870
Speakest thou in sober meanings?

2690
02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:24.830
By my life, I do, which I tenderdearly,

2691
02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:26.730
although I say I am a magician.

2692
02:09:26.730 --> 02:09:30.100
Therefore, put you in your bestarray,

2693
02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:31.230
and bid your friends,

2694
02:09:31.230 --> 02:09:33.930
for if you will be marriedtomorrow, you shall,

2695
02:09:33.930 --> 02:09:39.970
and to Rosalind, if you will.

2696
02:09:39.970 --> 02:09:43.900
Here comes a lover of mine and alover of hers.

2697
02:09:45.070 --> 02:09:47.670
Youth, you have done me muchungentleness

2698
02:09:47.670 --> 02:09:49.600
to show the letter that I writto you.

2699
02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:51.770
I care not if I have.

2700
02:09:51.770 --> 02:09:55.330
It is my study to seemdespiteful and ungentle to you.

2701
02:09:55.330 --> 02:09:57.600
You are there followed by afaithful shepherd.

2702
02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:00.070
Look on him; love him.

2703
02:10:00.070 --> 02:10:01.770
He worships you.

2704
02:10:01.770 --> 02:10:05.100
Good shepherd, tell this youthwhat 'tis to love.

2705
02:10:08.030 --> 02:10:12.900
It is to be all made of sighsand tears,

2706
02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:14.700
and so am I for Phebe.

2707
02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:16.330
And I for Ganymede.

2708
02:10:16.330 --> 02:10:17.670
And I for Rosalind.

2709
02:10:17.670 --> 02:10:20.770
And I for no woman.

2710
02:10:20.770 --> 02:10:23.970
It is to be all made of fantasy,

2711
02:10:23.970 --> 02:10:26.100
all made of passion,

2712
02:10:26.100 --> 02:10:28.700
and all made of wishes,

2713
02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:34.730
all adoration, duty, andobservance,

2714
02:10:34.730 --> 02:10:37.670
all humbleness,

2715
02:10:37.670 --> 02:10:43.070
all patience and impatience,

2716
02:10:43.070 --> 02:10:46.830
all purity,

2717
02:10:46.830 --> 02:10:49.700
all trial,

2718
02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:52.500
all obedience;

2719
02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:54.870
and so am I for Phebe.

2720
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:57.100
And so am I for Ganymede.

2721
02:10:57.100 --> 02:10:58.670
And so am I for Rosalind.

2722
02:10:58.670 --> 02:11:03.170
And so am I for no woman.

2723
02:11:03.170 --> 02:11:06.070
If this be so, why blame you meto love you?

2724
02:11:06.070 --> 02:11:08.470
If this be so, why blame you meto love you?

2725
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:10.970
If this be so, why blame you meto love you?

2726
02:11:10.970 --> 02:11:13.370
Who do you speak to, "Why blameyou me to love you?"

2727
02:11:13.370 --> 02:11:15.530
To her that is not here nor dothnot hear.

2728
02:11:15.530 --> 02:11:17.300
I pray you, no more of this.

2729
02:11:17.300 --> 02:11:19.470
It is like the howling of Irishwolves

2730
02:11:19.470 --> 02:11:22.330
against the moon.

2731
02:11:22.330 --> 02:11:25.000
I will help you, if I can.

2732
02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:28.070
I would love you, if I could.

2733
02:11:28.070 --> 02:11:31.970
Tomorrow, meet me all together.

2734
02:11:31.970 --> 02:11:34.400
I will marry you, if ever Imarry woman,

2735
02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:36.470
and I'll be married tomorrow.

2736
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:40.830
I will satisfy you, if ever Isatisfied man,

2737
02:11:40.830 --> 02:11:42.830
and you shall be marriedtomorrow.

2738
02:11:42.830 --> 02:11:44.730
I will content you,

2739
02:11:44.730 --> 02:11:46.370
if what pleases you contentsyou,

2740
02:11:46.370 --> 02:11:48.030
and you shall be marriedtomorrow.

2741
02:11:48.030 --> 02:11:49.530
As you love Rosalind, meet;

2742
02:11:49.530 --> 02:11:50.830
as you love Phebe, meet;

2743
02:11:50.830 --> 02:11:53.170
and as I love no woman, I'llmeet.

2744
02:11:53.170 --> 02:11:54.500
So fare you well.

2745
02:11:54.500 --> 02:11:57.030
I have left you commands.

2746
02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:58.830
I'll not fail, if I live.

2747
02:11:58.830 --> 02:12:00.430
Nor I.

2748
02:12:00.430 --> 02:12:01.430
Nor I.

2749
02:12:04.430 --> 02:12:06.700
Tomorrow is the joyful day,Audrey.

2750
02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:08.330
Tomorrow will we be married.

2751
02:12:08.330 --> 02:12:10.700
I do desire it with all myheart,

2752
02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:13.070
and I hope it is no dishonestdesire

2753
02:12:13.070 --> 02:12:17.270
to desire to be a woman of theworld.

2754
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:19.930
Here comes two of the banishedduke's pages.

2755
02:12:19.930 --> 02:12:21.330
Well met, honest gentleman.

2756
02:12:21.330 --> 02:12:22.600
By my troth, well met.

2757
02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:23.800
Come, sit, sit, in a song.

2758
02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:25.870
We are for you; sit i' themiddle.

2759
02:12:25.870 --> 02:12:28.830
It was a lover and his lass--

2760
02:12:28.830 --> 02:12:32.400
with a hey and a ho and a heynonino

2761
02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:36.400
and a hey noni nonino--

2762
02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:38.830
that o'er the green corn fieldsdid pass

2763
02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:43.430
in springtime, in springtime, inspringtime,

2764
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:46.430
the only pretty ring time,

2765
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:47.830
when birds do sing

02:12:47.830 --> 02:12:49.370
hey ding a ding a ding,

hey ding a ding a ding.

2769
02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:55.900
Sweet lovers love the spring.

2770
02:12:55.900 --> 02:12:59.000
Between the acres of the rye--

2771
02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.830
with a hey and a ho and a heynonino,

2772
02:13:02.830 --> 02:13:06.370
and a hey noni nonino--

2773
02:13:06.370 --> 02:13:09.600
these pretty country folk wouldlie

02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:14.430

02:13:14.430 --> 02:13:17.670
the only pretty ring time

2776
02:13:17.670 --> 02:13:19.530
when birds do sing

2777
02:13:19.530 --> 02:13:21.130
hey ding a ding a ding,

2778
02:13:21.130 --> 02:13:22.800

2780
02:13:24.430 --> 02:13:28.000
Sweet lovers love the spring.

2781
02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.770
This carol they began thathour--

2782
02:13:30.770 --> 02:13:34.930
with a hey and a ho and a heynonino,

2783
02:13:34.930 --> 02:13:38.470
and a hey noni nonino--

2784
02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:41.500
how that a life was but a flower

2785
02:13:41.500 --> 02:13:46.070
in springtime, in springtime, inspringtime,

2786
02:13:46.070 --> 02:13:48.900
the only pretty ring time

2787
02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:50.470
when birds do sing

2788
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:51.970
hey ding a ding a ding,

02:13:51.970 --> 02:13:53.470

hey ding a ding a ding.

2791
02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:58.400
Sweet lovers love the spring.

2792
02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:01.470
And therefore take the presenttime--

2793
02:14:01.470 --> 02:14:05.370
with a hey and a ho and a heynonino,

2794
02:14:05.370 --> 02:14:09.630
and a hey noni nonino--

2795
02:14:09.630 --> 02:14:12.200
for love is crowned with theprime

2796
02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:16.800
in springtime, in springtime, inspringtime,

2797
02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:19.830
the only pretty ring time

2798
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:21.330
when birds do sing

2799
02:14:21.330 --> 02:14:23.200
hey ding a ding a ding,

2800
02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:24.530
hey ding a ding a ding,

2801
02:14:24.530 --> 02:14:25.970
hey ding a ding a ding.

2802
02:14:25.970 --> 02:14:29.770
Sweet lovers love the spring.

2803
02:14:29.770 --> 02:14:30.970
Truly, young gentlemen,

2804
02:14:30.970 --> 02:14:33.100
though there was no great matterin the ditty,

2805
02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:35.030
yet the note was very untunable.

2806
02:14:35.030 --> 02:14:36.330
You are deceived, sir.

2807
02:14:36.330 --> 02:14:37.800
We kept time, lost not our time.

2808
02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:39.070
By my troth, yes,

2809
02:14:39.070 --> 02:14:42.470
I count it but time lost to hearsuch a foolish song.

2810
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:45.870
God by you, and God mend yourvoices.

2811
02:14:45.870 --> 02:14:47.170
Come, Audrey.

2812
02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:56.130
Dost thou believe, Orlando,

2813
02:14:56.130 --> 02:14:59.330
that the boy can do all thisthat he hath promised?

2814
02:14:59.330 --> 02:15:02.000
I sometimes do believe andsometimes do not

2815
02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.870
as those that fear they hope andknow they fear.

2816
02:15:05.870 --> 02:15:10.530
Patience once more, whiles ourcompact is urged.

2817
02:15:14.430 --> 02:15:17.500
You say, if I bring in yourRosalind,

2818
02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:19.530
you will bestow her on Orlandohere?

2819
02:15:19.530 --> 02:15:22.900
That would I, had I kingdoms togive with her.

2820
02:15:22.900 --> 02:15:26.330
You say you will have her when Ibring her?

2821
02:15:26.330 --> 02:15:30.670
That would I, were I of allkingdoms king.

2822
02:15:30.670 --> 02:15:33.030
You say, you'll marry me, if Ibe willing?

2823
02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:36.170
That will I should I die thehour after.

2824
02:15:36.170 --> 02:15:39.230
But if you do refuse to marryme,

2825
02:15:39.230 --> 02:15:42.130
you will give yourself to thismost faithful shepherd?

2826
02:15:42.130 --> 02:15:43.600
So is the bargain.

2827
02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:45.530
You say you'll have Phebe if shewill?

2828
02:15:45.530 --> 02:15:48.130
Though to have her and deathwere both one thing.

2829
02:15:50.630 --> 02:15:54.430
I have promised to make all thismatter even.

2830
02:15:54.430 --> 02:15:57.700
Keep you your word, O duke, togive your daughter;

2831
02:15:57.700 --> 02:16:01.500
You yours, Orlando, to receivehis daughter.

2832
02:16:02.630 --> 02:16:05.100
Keep your word, Phebe, to marryme

2833
02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:07.200
or else, refusing me, to wedthis shepherd.

2834
02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:09.370
Keep your word, Silvius,

2835
02:16:09.370 --> 02:16:11.900
to marry her if she do refuseme.

2836
02:16:13.570 --> 02:16:21.170
And from hence I go to makethese doubts all even.

2837
02:16:21.170 --> 02:16:23.800
I do remember in this shepherdboy

2838
02:16:23.800 --> 02:16:26.600
some lively touches of mydaughter's favor.

2839
02:16:26.600 --> 02:16:29.200
My lord, the first time that Iever saw him

2840
02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:31.500
methought he was a brother toyour daughter.

2841
02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:33.330
There is, sure, another floodtoward,

2842
02:16:33.330 --> 02:16:35.600
and these couples are coming tothe ark.

2843
02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:37.870
Here comes a pair of verystrange beasts

2844
02:16:37.870 --> 02:16:39.730
which in all tongues are calledfools.

2845
02:16:39.730 --> 02:16:43.130
Salutation and greeting to youall!

2846
02:16:43.130 --> 02:16:44.530
Good my lord, bid him welcome.

2847
02:16:44.530 --> 02:16:46.370
This is the motley-mindedgentleman

2848
02:16:46.370 --> 02:16:48.000
I have so often met in theforest.

2849
02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.170
He hath been a courtier, heswears.

2850
02:16:50.170 --> 02:16:53.430
If any man doubt that, let himput me to my purgation.

2851
02:16:53.430 --> 02:16:54.770
I have trod a measure.

2852
02:16:54.770 --> 02:16:56.100
I have flattered a lady.

2853
02:16:56.100 --> 02:16:57.770
I have been politic with myfriend,

2854
02:16:57.770 --> 02:16:59.370
smooth with mine enemy.

2855
02:16:59.370 --> 02:17:01.230
I have undone three tailors.

2856
02:17:01.230 --> 02:17:04.370
I have had four quarrels andlike to have fought one.

2857
02:17:04.370 --> 02:17:05.770
And how was that ta'en up?

2858
02:17:05.770 --> 02:17:08.130
Faith, we met and found ourquarrel

2859
02:17:08.130 --> 02:17:10.030
was upon the seventh cause.

2860
02:17:10.030 --> 02:17:12.330
How seventh cause?

2861
02:17:12.330 --> 02:17:14.030
Good my lord, like this fellow.

2862
02:17:14.030 --> 02:17:15.430
I like him very well.

2863
02:17:15.430 --> 02:17:16.630
God 'ild you, sir.

2864
02:17:16.630 --> 02:17:18.930
I desire you of the like.

2865
02:17:18.930 --> 02:17:20.200
I press in here, sir,

2866
02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:22.370
amongst the rest of the countrycopulatives,

2867
02:17:22.370 --> 02:17:24.130
to swear and to forswear

2868
02:17:24.130 --> 02:17:27.430
according as marriage binds andblood breaks,

2869
02:17:27.430 --> 02:17:29.130
a poor virgin, sir,

2870
02:17:29.130 --> 02:17:31.970
an ill-favored thing, sir, butmine own;

2871
02:17:31.970 --> 02:17:33.670
a poor humor of mine, sir,

2872
02:17:33.670 --> 02:17:37.070
to take that that no man elsewill.

2873
02:17:37.070 --> 02:17:38.900
Rich honesty dwells like amiser, sir,

2874
02:17:38.900 --> 02:17:40.100
in a poor house--

2875
02:17:40.100 --> 02:17:41.870
as your pearl in your fouloyster.

2876
02:17:41.870 --> 02:17:43.900
Faith, he is very swift andsententious.

2877
02:17:43.900 --> 02:17:45.270
But, for the seventh cause--

2878
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:47.570
how did you find the quarrel onthe seventh cause?

2879
02:17:47.570 --> 02:17:50.830
Upon a lie seven times removed--

2880
02:17:50.830 --> 02:17:54.100
bear your body more seeming,Audrey--

2881
02:17:54.100 --> 02:17:55.770
as thus, sir:

2882
02:17:55.770 --> 02:18:00.600
I did dislike the cut of acertain courtier's beard.

2883
02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:02.000
He sent me word

2884
02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.500
if I said his beard was not cutwell,

2885
02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:07.300
he was in the mind it was.

2886
02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:10.400
This is called the RetortCourteous.

2887
02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:12.930
If I sent him word again "It wasnot well cut,"

2888
02:18:12.930 --> 02:18:16.800
he would send me word, he cut itto please himself.

2889
02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:18.800
This is called the Quip Modest.

2890
02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:23.230
If again "It was not well cut,"he disabled my judgment.

2891
02:18:23.230 --> 02:18:26.430
This is called the ReplyChurlish.

2892
02:18:26.430 --> 02:18:27.830
If again "It was not well cut,"

2893
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:30.170
he would answer I spake nottrue.

2894
02:18:30.170 --> 02:18:32.170
This is called the ReproofValiant.

2895
02:18:32.170 --> 02:18:34.630
If again "It was not well cut,"he would say I lie.

2896
02:18:34.630 --> 02:18:36.870
This is called the CounterchequeQuarrelsome,

2897
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:41.100
and so to the Lie Circumstantialand the Lie Direct.

2898
02:18:41.100 --> 02:18:43.370
And how oft did you say hisbeard was not well cut?

2899
02:18:43.370 --> 02:18:45.700
I durst go no further than theLie Circumstantial,

2900
02:18:45.700 --> 02:18:47.570
nor he durst not give me the LieDirect,

2901
02:18:47.570 --> 02:18:50.270
and so we measured swords andparted.

2902
02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:54.800
Is not this a rare fellow, mylord?

2903
02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:58.000
He's as good at anything and yeta fool.

2904
02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.970
He uses his folly like astalking-horse

2905
02:19:00.970 --> 02:19:02.700
and under the presentation ofthat,

2906
02:19:02.700 --> 02:19:04.200
he shoots his wit.

2907
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:51.800
Then is there mirth in heaven

2908
02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:57.170
when earthly things made evenatone together.

2909
02:19:57.170 --> 02:20:01.100
Good duke, receive thy daughter.

2910
02:20:01.100 --> 02:20:03.470
Hymen from heaven brought her,

2911
02:20:03.470 --> 02:20:04.830
yea, brought her hither

2912
02:20:04.830 --> 02:20:07.570
that thou mightst join her handwith his

2913
02:20:07.570 --> 02:20:10.130
whose heart within his bosom is.

2914
02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:15.930
To you, I give myself, for I amyours.

2915
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:22.730
To you I give myself, for I amyours.

2916
02:20:28.630 --> 02:20:34.070
If there be truth in sight, youare my daughter.

2917
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:38.200
If there be truth in sight, youare my Rosalind.

2918
02:20:38.200 --> 02:20:41.230
If sight and shape be true,

2919
02:20:41.230 --> 02:20:44.000
why then, my love, adieu.

2920
02:20:45.770 --> 02:20:49.030
I'll have no father if you benot he.

2921
02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:52.500
I'll have no husband if you benot he...

2922
02:20:54.870 --> 02:20:57.630
nor ne'er wed woman if you benot she.

2923
02:20:58.700 --> 02:20:59.970
Peace, ho.

2924
02:20:59.970 --> 02:21:02.700
I bar confusion.

2925
02:21:02.700 --> 02:21:05.130
'Tis I must make conclusion

2926
02:21:05.130 --> 02:21:09.070
of these most strange events.

2927
02:21:09.070 --> 02:21:11.530
Here's eight that must takehands

2928
02:21:11.530 --> 02:21:13.830
to join in Hymen's bands

2929
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:16.300
if truth holds true contents.

2930
02:21:18.900 --> 02:21:22.570
You and you no cross shall part.

2931
02:21:32.200 --> 02:21:35.370
You and you are heart in heart.

2932
02:21:41.470 --> 02:21:44.330
You to his love must accord

2933
02:21:44.330 --> 02:21:46.570
or have a woman to your lord.

2934
02:21:51.300 --> 02:21:54.330
You and you are sure together

2935
02:21:54.330 --> 02:21:56.970
as the winter to foul weather.

2936
02:22:00.200 --> 02:22:03.300
Whiles a wedlock hymn we sing,

2937
02:22:03.300 --> 02:22:06.270
feed yourselves with questioning

2938
02:22:06.270 --> 02:22:09.200
that reason wonder may diminish

2939
02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:13.900
how thus we met and these thingsfinish.

2940
02:22:16.170 --> 02:22:18.770
Wedding is great Juno's crown,

2941
02:22:18.770 --> 02:22:21.030
O blessed bond of board and bed.

2942
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:23.600
'Tis Hymen peoples every town.

2943
02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:26.170
High wedlock then be honored.

2944
02:22:26.170 --> 02:22:29.570
Honor, high honor, and renown

2945
02:22:29.570 --> 02:22:34.270
to Hymen, god of every town.

2946
02:22:41.100 --> 02:22:44.870
O my dear niece, welcome thouart to me.

2947
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:49.600
Even daughter, welcome in noless degree.

2948
02:22:49.600 --> 02:22:53.000
I will not eat my word now thouart mine.

2949
02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:57.870
Thy faith my fancy to thee dothcombine.

2950
02:23:02.870 --> 02:23:05.030
Let me have audience for a wordor two.

2951
02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:08.200
I am the second son of old SirRowland

2952
02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:10.970
that bring these tidings to thisfair assembly.

2953
02:23:14.700 --> 02:23:16.700
Duke Frederick,

2954
02:23:16.700 --> 02:23:18.100
hearing how that every day

2955
02:23:18.100 --> 02:23:20.400
men of great worth resorted tothis forest,

2956
02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:22.030
address'd a mighty power,

2957
02:23:22.030 --> 02:23:24.730
which were on foot, in his ownconduct,

2958
02:23:24.730 --> 02:23:26.400
purposely to take his brotherhere

2959
02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:28.630
and put him to the sword,

2960
02:23:28.630 --> 02:23:31.370
and to the skirts of this wildwood, he came,

2961
02:23:31.370 --> 02:23:34.100
where, meeting with an oldreligious man,

2962
02:23:34.100 --> 02:23:36.930
after some question with him

2963
02:23:36.930 --> 02:23:38.870
was converted

2964
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:40.800
both from his enterprise

2965
02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:42.730
and from the world,

2966
02:23:42.730 --> 02:23:45.770
his crown bequeathing to hisbanish'd brother

2967
02:23:45.770 --> 02:23:48.200
and all their lands restored tothem again

2968
02:23:48.200 --> 02:23:49.600
that were with him exiled.

2969
02:23:52.170 --> 02:23:53.930
This to be true,

2970
02:23:53.930 --> 02:23:55.770
I do engage my life.

2971
02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:05.630
Welcome, young man.

2972
02:24:05.630 --> 02:24:09.370
Thou offer'st fairly to thybrothers' wedding.

2973
02:24:13.330 --> 02:24:17.800
To the one his lands withheld

2974
02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:21.730
and to the other a land itselfat large,

2975
02:24:21.730 --> 02:24:24.870
a potent dukedom.

2976
02:24:24.870 --> 02:24:27.600
First, in this forest, let us dothose ends

2977
02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:30.330
which here were well begun andwell begot:

2978
02:24:30.330 --> 02:24:33.430
and after, every of this happynumber

2979
02:24:33.430 --> 02:24:36.870
that have endured shrewd daysand nights with us

2980
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:40.530
shall share the good of ourreturned fortune

2981
02:24:40.530 --> 02:24:43.300
according to the measure oftheir states.

2982
02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:47.630
Meantime, forget this new-fall'ndignity

2983
02:24:47.630 --> 02:24:49.670
and fall into our rusticrevelry.

2984
02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:50.800
Play, music!

2985
02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:53.070
And you, brides and bridegroomsall,

2986
02:24:53.070 --> 02:24:55.070
with measure heap'd in joy,

2987
02:24:55.070 --> 02:24:57.430
to the measures fall.

2988
02:24:57.430 --> 02:25:00.670
Sir, by your patience.

2989
02:25:02.300 --> 02:25:06.400
If I heard you rightly, the dukehath put on a religious life

2990
02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:08.770
and thrown into neglect thepompous court?

2991
02:25:08.770 --> 02:25:09.770
He hath.

2992
02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:15.170
To him will I.

2993
02:25:15.170 --> 02:25:16.630
Out of these convertites,

2994
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:21.830
there is much matter to be heardand learn'd.

2995
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:27.170
You to your former honor Ibequeath.

2996
02:25:27.170 --> 02:25:30.000
Your patience and your virtuewell deserves it.

2997
02:25:32.470 --> 02:25:35.530
You to a love that your truefaith doth merit.

2998
02:25:38.470 --> 02:25:43.270
You to your land and love andgreat allies.

2999
02:25:46.500 --> 02:25:49.700
You to a long and well-deservedbed.

3000
02:25:52.730 --> 02:25:54.930
And you to wrangling,

3001
02:25:54.930 --> 02:25:59.230
for thy loving voyage is but fortwo months victuall'd.

3002
02:25:59.230 --> 02:26:02.530
So, to your pleasures.

3003
02:26:02.530 --> 02:26:04.470
I am for other than for dancingmeasures.

3004
02:26:04.470 --> 02:26:08.170
Stay, Jaques, stay.

3005
02:26:08.170 --> 02:26:12.400
To see no pastime I, what youwill have,

3006
02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:16.500
I'll stay to know at yourabandon'd cave.

3007
02:26:22.130 --> 02:26:24.470
Proceed, proceed.

3008
02:26:24.470 --> 02:26:28.870
We will begin these rites as wedo trust they'll end,

3009
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:30.970
in true delights.

3010
02:27:22.830 --> 02:27:25.530
It is not the fashion to see thelady the epilogue,

3011
02:27:25.530 --> 02:27:30.130
but it is no more unhandsomethan to see the lord theprologue.

3012
02:27:30.130 --> 02:27:32.930
If it be true that good wineneeds no bush,

3013
02:27:32.930 --> 02:27:35.230
'tis true that a good play needsno epilogue.

3014
02:27:35.230 --> 02:27:38.930
Yet to good wine, they do usegood bushes,

3015
02:27:38.930 --> 02:27:40.600
and a good play proves thebetter

3016
02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:43.030
by the help of good epilogue.

3017
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:47.070
What a case am I in then that amneither a good epilogue

3018
02:27:47.070 --> 02:27:50.570
nor cannot insinuate with you inthe behalf of a good play.

3019
02:27:50.570 --> 02:27:52.370
I am not furnished like abeggar.

3020
02:27:52.370 --> 02:27:55.630
Therefore, to beg will notbecome me.

3021
02:27:57.600 --> 02:28:01.800
My way is to conjure you,

3022
02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:04.630
and I'll begin with the women.

3023
02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:11.470
I charge you, O women, for thelove you bear to men,

3024
02:28:11.470 --> 02:28:14.100
to like as much of this play asplease you;

3025
02:28:14.100 --> 02:28:18.800
and I charge you, O men, for thelove you bear to women--

3026
02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:22.100
as I perceive by your simperingnone of you hates them--

3027
02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:28.500
that between you and the women,the play may please.

3028
02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:31.300
If I were a woman,

3029
02:28:31.300 --> 02:28:35.730
I would kiss as many of you ashad beards that pleased me,

3030
02:28:35.730 --> 02:28:39.300
complexions that liked me, andbreaths that I defied not;

3031
02:28:39.300 --> 02:28:44.230
and as many of you as have goodbeards or good faces or sweetbreaths

3032
02:28:44.230 --> 02:28:48.970
will, for my kind offer, when Imake curtsy,

3033
02:28:48.970 --> 02:28:50.970
bid me farewell.

3034
02:31:12.070 --> 02:31:15.070
