00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:54.130


2
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.870
You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods

3
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.900
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers

4
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.830
Still seem as does the king's.

5
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.630
But what's the matter?

6
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.730
His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom,

7
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.630
whom he purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow

8
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.870
That late he married--hath referr'd herself

9
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.900
Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;

10
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.970
Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd:

11
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.630
all Is outward sorrow; though I think the king

12
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.230
Be touch'd at very heart.

13
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.700
None but the king?

14
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.170
He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,

15
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.070
That most desired the match; but not a courtier,

16
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.870
Although they wear their faces to the bent

17
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.670
Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not

18
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.700
Glad at the thing they scowl at.

19
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.930
And why so?

20
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.030
He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing

21
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.270
Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--

22
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.700
I mean, that married her, alack, good man!

23
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.200
And therefore banish'd--is a creature such

24
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.230
As, to seek through the regions of the earth

25
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.230
For one his like, there would be something failing

26
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.630
In him that should compare. I do not think

27
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.100
So fair an outward and such stuff within

28
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.670
Endows a man but he.

29
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.200
You speak him far.

30
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.600
I do extend him, sir, within himself,

31
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.370
Crush him together rather than unfold

32
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.670
His measure duly.

33
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.870
What's his name and birth?

34
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.430
I cannot delve him to the root: his father

35
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.300
Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour

36
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.530
Against the Romans with Cassibelan,

37
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.970
But had his titles by Tenantius whom

38
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.270
He served with glory and admired success,

39
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.030
So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;

40
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.300
And had, besides this gentleman in question,

41
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.170
Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time

42
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.030
Died with their swords in hand;

43
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.300
for which their father,

44
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.100
Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow

45
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.900
That he quit being, and his gentle lady,

46
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.370
Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased

47
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.630
As he was born. The king he takes the babe

48
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.530
To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,

49
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.330
Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,

50
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.500
Puts to him all the learnings that his time

51
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.030
Could make him the receiver of; which he took,

52
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.370
As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,

53
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.900
And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--

54
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.530
Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,

55
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.100
A sample to the youngest, to the more mature

56
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.670
A glass that feated them, and to the graver

57
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.100
A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,

58
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.000
For whom he now is banish'd, her own price

59
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.630
Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;

60
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.400
By her election may be truly read

61
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.570
What kind of man he is.

62
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.570
I honour him

63
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.700
Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,

64
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.570
Is she sole child to the king?

65
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.730
His only child.

66
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.170
He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,

67
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.100
Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,

68
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.170
I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery

69
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.930
Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge

70
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.400
Which way they went.

71
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.070
How long is this ago?

72
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.170
Some twenty years.

73
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.070
That a king's children should be so convey'd,

74
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.670
So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,

75
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.830
That could not trace them!

76
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.330
Howsoe'er 'tis strange,

77
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.630
Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,

78
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.830
Yet is it true.

79
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.970
I do well believe you.

80
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.030
No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,

81
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.700
After the slander of most stepmothers,

82
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.670
Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner,

83
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.270
but your gaoler shall deliver you the keys

84
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.000
That lock up your restraint.

85
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.800
For you, Posthumus,

86
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.630
So soon as I can win the offended king,

87
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.930
I will be known your advocate: marry, yet

88
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.670
The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good

89
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.130
You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience

90
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.330
Your wisdom may inform you.

91
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.700
Please your highness,

92
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.700
I will from hence to-day.

93
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.230
You know the peril.

94
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.770
I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying

95
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.330
The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king

96
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.300
Hath charged you should not speak together.

97
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.830
Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant

98
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.430
Can tickle where she wounds!

99
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.000
My dearest husband,

100
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.230
I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--

101
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.230
Always reserved my holy duty--what

102
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.100
His rage can do on me: you must be gone;

103
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.230
And I shall here abide the hourly shot

104
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.230
Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,

105
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.100
But that there is this jewel in the world

106
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.630
That I may see again.

107
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.230
My queen! my mistress!

108
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.200
O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause

109
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.770
To be suspected of more tenderness

110
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.470
Than doth become a man. I will remain

111
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.730
The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:

112
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.300
My residence in Rome at one Philario's,

113
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.700
Who to my father was a friend, to me

114
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.900
Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,

115
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.670
And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,

116
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.670
Though ink be made of gall.

117
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.870
Be brief, I pray you:

118
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.100
If the king come, I shall incur I know not

119
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.230
How much of his displeasure.

120
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.230
Should we be taking leave

121
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.070
As long a term as yet we have to live,

122
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.370
The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!

123
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.700
Nay, stay a little:

124
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.470
Were you but riding forth to air yourself,

125
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.770
Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;

126
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:42.970
This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;

127
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.730
But keep it till you woo another wife,

128
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.000
When Imogen is dead.

129
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.770
How, how! another?

130
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.230
You gentle gods, give me but this I have,

131
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.230
And sear up my embracements from a next

132
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.100
With bonds of death!

133
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.070
Remain, remain thou here

134
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.870
While sense can keep it on.

135
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:11.230
And, sweetest, fairest,

136
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.530
As I my poor self did exchange for you,

137
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.900
To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles

138
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:26.670
I still win of you: for my sake wear this;

139
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.200
It is a manacle of love; I'll place it

140
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.130
Upon this fairest prisoner.

141
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.730
O the gods!

142
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.300
When shall we see again?

143
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.100
Alack, the king!

144
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:47.770
Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!

145
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.330
If after this command thou fraught the court

146
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.670
With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!

147
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.770
Thou'rt poison to my blood.

148
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.570
The gods protect you!

149
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.200
And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.

150
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.070
There cannot be a pinch in death

151
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.570
More sharp than this is.

152
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.330
O disloyal thing,

153
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.430
That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st

154
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.270
A year's age on me.

155
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.130
I beseech you, sir,

156
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.570
Harm not yourself with your vexation

157
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.300
I am senseless of your wrath;

158
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.070
Past grace? obedience?

159
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.630
Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.

160
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.800
That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!

161
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.470
O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,

162
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.930
And did avoid a puttock.

163
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.430
Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne

164
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:34.170
A seat for baseness.

165
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.030
No; I rather added

166
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.500
A lustre to it.

167
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.930
O thou vile one!

168
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.400
Sir, It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:

169
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.130
You bred him as my playfellow, and he is

170
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.630
A man worth any woman, overbuys me

171
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.030
Almost the sum he pays.

172
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.170
What, art thou mad?

173
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.100
Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were

174
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.300
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus

175
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.130
Our neighbour shepherd's son!

176
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.430
Thou foolish thing!

177
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.270
They were again together: you have done

178
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.130
Not after our command. Away with her,

179
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.200
And pen her up.

180
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.770
Beseech your patience. Peace,

181
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:13.630
Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,

182
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.930
Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort

183
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.370
Out of your best advice.

184
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.270
Nay, let her languish

185
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:24.430
A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,

186
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.930
Die of this folly!

187
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.730
Fie! you must give way.

188
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.230
Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?

189
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.800
My lord your son drew on my master.

190
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.530
Ha! No harm, I trust, is done?

191
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.530
There might have been,

192
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:45.700
But that my master rather play'd than fought

193
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.300
And had no help of anger: they were parted

194
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.730
By gentlemen at hand.

195
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.400
I am very glad on't.

196
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.470
Why came you from your master?

197
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.000
On his command: he would not suffer me

198
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.870
To bring him to the haven; left these notes

199
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.370
Of what commands I should be subject to,

200
00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.630
When 't pleased you to employ me.

201
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.070
I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least

202
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.130
Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.

203
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.970
If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it.

204
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.930
Have I hurt him?

205
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.330
No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.

206
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.570
Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass,

207
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.500
if he be not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel,

208
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.400
if it be not hurt.

209
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.870
The villain would not stand me.

210
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.370
No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.

211
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.570
Stand you! You have land enough of your own:

212
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.670
but he added to your having; gave you some ground.

213
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.970
I would they had not come between us.

214
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.130
And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!

215
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.370
Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain

216
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.130
go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen

217
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.670
small reflection of her wit.

218
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.830
She shines not upon fools,

219
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.800
lest the reflection should hurt her.

220
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.300
Come, I'll to my chamber.

221
00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.430
Would there had been some hurt done!

222
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.000
I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,

223
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.770
And question'dst every sail: if he should write

224
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.330
And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,

225
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.830
As offer'd mercy is.

226
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.100
What was the last That he spake to thee?

227
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.070
It was his queen, his queen!

228
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.130
Then waved his handkerchief?

229
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.670
And kiss'd it, madam.

230
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.600
Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!

231
00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:21.770
And that was all?

232
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.730
No, madam; for so long

233
00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.400
As he could make me with this eye or ear

234
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.800
Distinguish him from others, he did keep

235
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.570
The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,

236
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.270
Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind

237
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:40.370
Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,

238
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.870
How swift his ship.

239
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.070
Thou shouldst have made him

240
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.100
As little as a crow, or less, ere left to after-eye him.

241
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.170
Madam, so I did.

242
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.070
I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them,

243
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.070
but to look upon him, till the diminution

244
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.030
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,

245
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.770
Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from

246
00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:01.700
The smallness of a gnat to air, and then

247
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.000
Have turn'd mine eye and wept.

248
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.570
But, good Pisanio, When shall we hear from him?

249
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:11.230
Be assured, madam,

250
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.330
With his next vantage.

251
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.730
I did not take my leave of him, but had

252
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.770
Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him

253
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:23.970
How I would think on him at certain hours

254
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.330
Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear

255
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.730
The shes of Italy should not betray

256
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.470
Mine interest and his honour,

257
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.200
or have charged him,

258
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.430
At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,

259
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.770
To encounter me with orisons, for then

260
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:44.800
I am in heaven for him; or ere I could

261
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.500
Give him that parting kiss which I had set

262
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.970
Betwixt two charming words,

263
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.430
comes in my father

264
00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:00.170
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north

265
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.370
Shakes all our buds from growing.

266
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.200
The queen, madam,

267
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.770
Desires your highness' company.

268
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.500
Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.

269
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.400
I will attend the queen.

270
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.870
Madam, I shall.

271
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.430
Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain:

272
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.100
he was then of a crescent note,

273
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.500
expected to prove so worthy

274
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.700
as since he hath been allowed the name of;

275
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.300
but I could then have looked on him without the help

276
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.100
of admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments

277
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.300
had been tabled by his side

278
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.070
and I to peruse him by items.

279
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.230
You speak of him when he was less furnished than now

280
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.030
he is with that which makes him

281
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.700
both without and within.

282
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.470
I have seen him in France: we had very many there

283
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.730
could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.

284
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.630
This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein

285
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.900
he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,

286
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.770
words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.

287
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:05.970
And then his banishment.

288
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.930
Ay, and the approbation of those that weep

289
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.500
this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully

290
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.270
to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,

291
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.370
which else an easy battery might lay flat,

292
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:20.200
for taking a beggar without less quality.

293
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.700
But how comes it he is to sojourn with you?

294
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.730
How creeps acquaintance?

295
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.730
His father and I were soldiers together;

296
00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:31.900
to whom I have been often bound

297
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.870
for no less than my life.

298
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.630
Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained

299
00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:36.970
amongst you as suits, with gentlemen

300
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.870
of your knowing, to a stranger of his quality.

301
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.730
I beseech you all, be better known

302
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.470
to this gentleman; whom I commend

303
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.330
to you as a noble friend of mine:

304
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.870
how worthy he is I will leave to appear hereafter,

305
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.430
rather than story him in his own hearing.

306
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.600
Sir, we have known together in Orleans.

307
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.830
Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,

308
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.370
which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.

309
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.570
Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness:

310
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.270
I was glad I did atone my countryman and you;

311
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.130
it had been pity

312
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.330
you should have been put together

313
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.330
with so mortal a purpose as then each bore,

314
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.570
upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature.

315
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.770
By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;

316
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.830
rather shunned to go even with what I heard

317
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.100
than in my every action to be guided by others' experiences:

318
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.130
but upon my mended judgment--

319
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.700
if I offend not to say it is mended--

320
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.470
my quarrel was not altogether slight.

321
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:39.000
Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?

322
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.730
Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,

323
00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.030
which may, without contradiction,

324
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.470
suffer the report.

325
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.030
It was much like an argument that fell out last night,

326
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.270
where each of us fell in praise

327
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:50.730
of our country mistresses;

328
00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.570
this gentleman at that time vouching--

329
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:55.470
and upon warrant of bloody affirmation--

330
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.470
his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,

331
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:03.330
chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable

332
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.330
than any the rarest of our ladies in France.

333
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.530
That lady is not now living,

334
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.330
or this gentleman's opinion by this worn out.

335
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:17.500
She holds her virtue still and I my mind.

336
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.030
You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.

337
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.930
Being so far provoked as I was in France,

338
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.530
I would abate her nothing,

339
00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.130
though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.

340
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.370
As fair and as good--

341
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:38.670
a kind of hand-in-hand comparison--

342
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.700
had been something too fair and too good

343
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.500
for any lady in Britain. If she went before others

344
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.270
I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres

345
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.500
many I have beheld. I could not but believe

346
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.930
she excelled many: but I have not seen

347
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:57.000
the most precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.

348
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.230
I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.

349
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.470
What do you esteem it at?

350
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.730
More than the world enjoys.

351
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.670
Either your unparagoned mistress is dead,

352
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.270
or she's outprized by a trifle.

353
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.600
You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given,

354
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.470
if there were wealth enough for the purchase,

355
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:16.930
or merit for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,

356
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.470
and only the gift of the gods.

357
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.370
Which the gods have given you?

358
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:24.370
Which, by their graces, I will keep.

359
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:28.730
You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,

360
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:32.530
strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds.

361
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.170
Your ring may be stolen too: so your brace

362
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.500
of unprizable estimations; the one is but frail

363
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.230
and the other casual; a cunning thief,

364
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.130
or a that way accomplished courtier,

365
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.300
would hazard the winning both of first and last.

366
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.770
Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier

367
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.130
to convince the honour of my mistress,

368
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.170
if, in the holding or loss of that, you term her frail.

369
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.430
I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves;

370
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.470
notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.

371
00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.970
Let us leave here, gentlemen.

372
00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:04.500
Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior,

373
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.400
I thank him, makes no stranger of me;

374
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.700
we are familiar at first.

375
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.630
With five times so much conversation, I should get

376
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.400
ground of your fair mistress,

377
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.270
make her go back, even to the yielding,

378
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.300
had I admittance and opportunity to friend.

379
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.370
No, no.

380
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.600
I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate

381
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.930
to your ring; which, in my opinion,

382
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:23.070
o'ervalues it something:

383
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.100
but I make my wager rather against your confidence

384
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.370
than her reputation:

385
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.530
and to bar your offence herein too,

386
00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.770
I durst attempt it against any lady in the world.

387
00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.030
You are a great deal abused

388
00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.530
in too bold a persuasion;

389
00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:38.470
Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;

390
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:39.800
let it die as it was born,

391
00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.170
and, I pray you, be better acquainted.

392
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.570
Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's

393
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.570
on the approbation of what I have spoke!

394
00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.770
What lady would you choose to assail?

395
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:53.830
Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.

396
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.100
I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,

397
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.270
commend me to the court where your lady is,

398
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.300
with no more advantage than the opportunity

399
00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.630
of a second conference,

400
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:07.700
and I will bring from thence

401
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.330
that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.

402
00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.630
I will wage against your gold, gold to it:

403
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.700
my ring I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.

404
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.700
You are afraid,

405
00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:22.830
and therein the wiser.

406
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.070
If you buy ladies' flesh at a million a dram,

407
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.600
you cannot preserve it from tainting:

408
00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.770
but I see you have some religion in you,

409
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:34.770
that you fear.

410
00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.230
This is but a custom in your tongue;

411
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.670
you bear a graver purpose, I hope.

412
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.370
I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo

413
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.730
what's spoken, I swear.

414
00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:50.070
Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your return:

415
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.100
let there be covenants drawn between's:

416
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.800
my mistress exceeds in goodness

417
00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.000
the hugeness of your unworthy thinking:

418
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.100
I dare you to this match: here's my ring.

419
00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.000
I will have it no lay.

420
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.330
By the gods, it is one. If I bring you

421
00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:07.330
no sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest

422
00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.970
bodily part of your mistress,

423
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.900
my ten thousand ducats

424
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.300
are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,

425
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.230
and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,

426
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.230
she your jewel, this your jewel,

427
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:21.400
and my gold are yours:

428
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.570
provided I have your commendation

429
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:23.870
for my more free entertainment.

430
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:25.870
I embrace these conditions;

431
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:27.400
let us have articles betwixt us.

432
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.470
Only, thus far you shall answer:

433
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:35.870
if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly

434
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.930
to understand you have prevailed,

435
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:39.170
I am no further your enemy;

436
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:40.430
she is not worth our debate:

437
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.130
if she remain unseduced,

438
00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:43.400
you not making it appear otherwise,

439
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.030
for your ill opinion and the assault you have made

440
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.330
to her chastity you shall answer me

441
00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.200
with your sword.

442
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.730
Your hand; a covenant:

443
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.330
we will have these things

444
00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.200
set down by lawful counsel, and straight away

445
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.070
for Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold

446
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.070
and starve.

447
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.130
Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?

448
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.070
Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:

449
00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.970
But I beseech your grace, without offence,--

450
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.970
My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have

451
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.330
Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,

452
00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.700
Which are the movers of a languishing death;

453
00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.000
But though slow, deadly?

454
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:22.900
I wonder, doctor,

455
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.900
Thou ask'st me such a question.

456
00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.170
Have I not been Thy pupil long?

457
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.100
Hast thou not learn'd me how to make perfumes?

458
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.930
distil? preserve? yea, so

459
00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.930
That our great king himself doth woo me oft

460
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:43.930
For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--

461
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:50.000
Unless thou think'st me devilish--

462
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.270
is't not meet that I did amplify my judgment

463
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.700
in other conclusions?

464
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:54.970
I will try the forces

465
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.070
Of these thy compounds on such creatures

466
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.970
as we count not worth the hanging, but none human,

467
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.170
To try the vigour of them and apply

468
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.600
Allayments to their act, and by them gather

469
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.670
Their several virtues and effects.

470
00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:08.730
Your highness

471
00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:11.170
Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:

472
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.070
Besides, the seeing these effects will be

473
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.570
Both noisome and infectious.

474
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:16.870
O, content thee.

475
00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.730
Here comes a flattering rascal;

476
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.330
upon him will I first work:

477
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.900
I do not like her. She doth think she has

478
00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.530
Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,

479
00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.270
And will not trust one of her malice

480
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.730
with a drug of such damn'd nature.

481
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:41.470
Those she has will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;

482
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.930
Which first, perchance, she'll prove on cats and dogs,

483
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:47.130
Then afterward up higher: but there is no danger

484
00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:48.530
in what show of death it makes,

485
00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.970
More than the locking-up the spirits a time,

486
00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.600
To be more fresh, reviving.

487
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.230
Weeps she still, say'st thou?

488
00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:57.370
Dost thou think in time

489
00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.230
She will not quench and let instructions enter

490
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:02.230
Where folly now possesses?

491
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:07.500
Do thou work:

492
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.000
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,

493
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.100
I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then

494
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.230
As great as is thy master,

495
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.100
greater,

496
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.870
for his fortunes all lie speechless and his name

497
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:25.000
Is at last gasp: return he cannot,

498
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.600
nor continue where he is: to shift his being

499
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.330
Is to exchange one misery with another,

500
00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.470
And every day that comes comes to decay

501
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.400
A day's work in him.

502
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.100
What shalt thou expect,

503
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.130
To be depender on a thing that leans,

504
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.800
Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,

505
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.200
So much as but to prop him?

506
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.000
Thou takest up

507
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.500
Thou know'st not what;

508
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.230
but take it for thy labour:

509
00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:07.270
It is a thing I made, which hath the king

510
00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:11.670
Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know

511
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.670
What is more cordial.

512
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.270
Nay, I prethee, take it;

513
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.430
It is an earnest of a further good

514
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:22.930
That I mean to thee.

515
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:26.500
Tell thy mistress how

516
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.000
The case stands with her;

517
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:30.600
do't as from thyself.

518
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.900
Think what a chance thou changest on, but think

519
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.700
Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,

520
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.300
Who shall take notice of thee:

521
00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:43.200
I'll move the king

522
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.670
To any shape of thy preferment such

523
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:49.700
As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,

524
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.830
That set thee on to this desert, am bound

525
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.830
To load thy merit richly.

526
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.900
Call my women:

527
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.700
Think on my words.

528
00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:20.370
A sly and constant knave,

529
00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:25.500
Not to be shaked; the agent for his master

530
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.170
And the remembrancer of her to hold

531
00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:34.100
The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that

532
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:38.000
Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her

533
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.130
Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,

534
00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:48.430
Except she bend her humour, shall be assured

535
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.600
To taste of too.

536
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.930
A father cruel, and a step-dame false;

537
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:19.330
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,

538
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:24.230
That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!

539
00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:31.000
My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated

540
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Vexations of it!

541
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.370
Had I been thief-stol'n,

542
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:41.070
As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable

543
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:44.970
Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,

544
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.270
How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,

545
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:54.630
Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!

546
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.930
Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,

547
00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:58.870
Comes from my lord with letters.

548
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.070
Change you, madam?

549
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.000
The worthy Leonatus is in safety

550
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.870
And greets your highness dearly.

551
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:10.430
Thanks, good sir:

552
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.070
You're kindly welcome.

553
00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:17.700
He is one of the noblest note,

554
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.370
to whose kindnesses I am most infinitely tied.

555
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:23.500
Reflect upon him accordingly, as you value your trust--

556
00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.970
LEONATUS.'

557
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.370
So far I read aloud:

558
00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:28.530
But even the very middle of my heart

559
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.870
Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.

560
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.570
You are as welcome, worthy sir,

561
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:36.370
as I Have words to bid you, and shall find it so

562
00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:37.700
In all that I can do.

563
00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.700
Thanks, fairest lady.

564
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.200
What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes

565
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.200
To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop

566
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.930
Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt

567
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:52.800
The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones

568
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.000
Upon the number'd beach? and can we not

569
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.470
Partition make with spectacles so precious

570
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.830
'Twixt fair and foul?

571
00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.570
What makes your admiration?

572
00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.170
It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys

573
00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.970
'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way

574
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:08.730
and contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,

575
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:10.100
For idiots in this case of favour would

576
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.570
Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;

577
00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.400
Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed

578
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.100
Should make desire vomit emptiness,

579
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.400
Not so allured to feed.

580
00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.230
What is the matter, trow?

581
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:21.970
The cloyed will,

582
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.500
That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub

583
00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.700
Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb

584
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.130
Longs after for the garbage.

585
00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:30.870
What, dear sir,

586
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.800
Thus raps you? Are you well?

587
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:38.930
Thanks, madam; well.

588
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:42.100
Beseech you, sir, desire

589
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.430
My man's abode where I did leave him:

590
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:44.700
he Is strange and peevish.

591
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.800
I was going, sir,

592
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.870
To give him welcome.

593
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.070
Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?

594
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.300
Well, madam.

595
00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:08.730
Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.

596
00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:12.470
Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there

597
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:16.200
So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd

598
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.700
The Briton reveller.

599
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:18.630
When he was here,

600
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:21.600
He did incline to sadness, and oft-times

601
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.600
Not knowing why.

602
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.030
I never saw him sad.

603
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:30.400
There is a Frenchman his companion, one

604
00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.930
An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves

605
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:37.330
A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces

606
00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:41.930
The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--

607
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:45.100
Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,

608
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.970
Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows

609
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.670
By history, report, or his own proof,

610
00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:54.130
What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose

611
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:57.470
But must be, will his free hours languish

612
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:58.700
for assured bondage?

613
00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.700
Will my lord say so?

614
00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.970
Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:

615
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:05.100
It is a recreation to be by and hear him

616
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.100
mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,

617
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.130
Some men are much to blame.

618
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:10.130
Not he, I hope.

619
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:17.630
Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might

620
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:23.300
Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;

621
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.530
In you, which I account his beyond all talents,

622
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:34.130
Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound

623
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:35.030
To pity too.

624
00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:35.770
What do you pity, sir?

625
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.730
Two creatures heartily.

626
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.200
Am I one, sir?

627
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.700
You look on me:

628
00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.100
what wreck discern you in me

629
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.430
Deserves your pity?

630
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.670
Lamentable! What,

631
00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.730
To hide me from the radiant sun and solace

632
00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:55.670
I' the dungeon by a snuff?

633
00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:56.570
I pray you, sir,

634
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:57.800
Deliver with more openness your answers

635
00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.370
To my demands. Why do you pity me?

636
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:01.830
That others do--

637
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:07.030
I was about to say--enjoy your--

638
00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:10.030
But It is an office of the gods to venge it,

639
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:11.400
Not mine to speak on 't.

640
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.400
You do seem to know

641
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.070
Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--

642
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.330
Since doubling things go ill often hurts more

643
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:22.030
Than to be sure they do; for certainties

644
00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:24.400
Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,

645
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.970
The remedy then born--discover to me

646
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:28.900
What both you spur and stop.

647
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.230
Had I this cheek

648
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:38.030
To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,

649
00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:40.230
Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul

650
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.500
To the oath of loyalty; this object, which

651
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.070
Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,

652
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:49.970
Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,

653
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.200
Slaver with lips as common as the stairs

654
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.270
That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands

655
00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:59.070
Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as

656
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:02.270
With labour; then by-peeping in an eye

657
00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.300
Base and unlustrous as the smoky light

658
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.500
That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit

659
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.570
That all the plagues of hell should at one time

660
00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:10.870
Encounter such revolt.

661
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:11.670
My lord, I fear,

662
00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:13.000
Has forgot Britain.

663
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.500
And himself. Not I,

664
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.270
Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce

665
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:23.270
The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces

666
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:25.900
That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue

667
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.370
Charms this report out.

668
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:28.400
Let me hear no more.

669
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.030
O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart

670
00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.100
With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady

671
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.730
So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,

672
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:37.430
Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd

673
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:39.500
With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition

674
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.330
Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures

675
00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:43.970
That play with all infirmities for gold

676
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.900
Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff

677
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.800
As well might poison poison! Be revenged;

678
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.870
Or she that bore you was no queen, and you

679
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:57.100
Recoil from your great stock.

680
00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.330
Revenged!

681
00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:01.930
How should I be revenged? If this be true,--

682
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.000
As I have such a heart that both mine ears

683
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.730
Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,

684
00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:09.830
How should I be revenged?

685
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:10.870
Should he make me

686
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:14.070
Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,

687
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.570
Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,

688
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:25.870
In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.

689
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.930
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,

690
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:35.930
More noble than that runagate to your bed,

691
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.330
And will continue fast to your affection,

692
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:42.830
Still close as sure.

693
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:46.400
What, ho, Pisanio!

694
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.670
Let me my service tender on your lips.

695
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:58.470
Away! I do condemn mine ears that have

696
00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:03.270
So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,

697
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.230
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not

698
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:11.330
For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.

699
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.170
Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far

700
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.270
From thy report as thou from honour, and

701
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:20.100
Solicit'st here a lady that disdains

702
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:25.900
both thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!

703
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.370
The king my father shall be made acquainted

704
00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:32.270
Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,

705
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.800
A saucy stranger in his court to mart

706
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.070
As in a Romish stew and to expound

707
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:39.930
His beastly mind to us, he hath a court

708
00:34:39.930 --> 00:34:41.370
He little cares for and a daughter who

709
00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:44.400
He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!

710
00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.870
O happy Leonatus! I may say

711
00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:49.500
The credit that thy lady hath of thee

712
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.800
Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness

713
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.800
Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!

714
00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.500
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever

715
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.030
Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only

716
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:05.030
For the most worthiest fit!

717
00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.300
Give me your pardon.

718
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:14.930
I have spoke this, to know if your affiance

719
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:20.330
Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,

720
00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:23.800
That which he is, new o'er: and he is one

721
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.670
The truest manner'd; such a holy witch

722
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.200
That he enchants societies into him;

723
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.030
Half all men's hearts are his.

724
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.000
You make amends.

725
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:

726
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.630
He hath a kind of honour sets him off,

727
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:42.100
More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,

728
00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.700
Most mighty princess, that I have adventured

729
00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.700
To try your taking a false report; which hath

730
00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.900
Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment

731
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.670
In the election of a sir so rare,

732
00:35:52.670 --> 00:36:00.130
Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him

733
00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:03.400
Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,

734
00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:10.870
Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.

735
00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:12.830
All's well, sir:

736
00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:17.400
take my power i' the court for yours.

737
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.070
My humble thanks.

738
00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.230
I had almost forgot

739
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.030
To entreat your grace but in a small request,

740
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:35.130
And yet of moment to, for it concerns

741
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:36.930
Your lord; myself and other noble friends,

742
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:37.900
Are partners in the business.

743
00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:38.930
Pray, what is't?

744
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.900
Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--

745
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.170
The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums

746
00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:49.730
To buy a present for the emperor

747
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:51.130
Which I, the factor for the rest, have done

748
00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:55.230
In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels

749
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:57.470
Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;

750
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:58.970
And I am something curious, being strange,

751
00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:02.370
To have them in safe stowage: may it please you

752
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:03.530
To take them in protection?

753
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:04.500
Willingly;

754
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.470
And pawn mine honour for their safety: since

755
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.270
My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them

756
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:12.370
In my bedchamber.

757
00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:13.230
They are in a trunk,

758
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.430
Attended by my men: I will make bold

759
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:17.000
To send them to you, only for this night;

760
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
I must aboard to-morrow.

761
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.030
O, no, no.

762
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.900
Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word

763
00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:24.270
By lengthening my return. From Gallia

764
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:26.000
I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise

765
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.830
To see your grace.

766
00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.200
I thank you for your pains:

767
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:41.030
pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;

768
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:43.170
they dare not fight with me, because of the queen

769
00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:46.730
my mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful

770
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:49.130
of fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock

771
00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:50.670
that nobody can match.

772
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:51.870
Sayest thou?

773
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:53.830
It is not fit your lordship should undertake

774
00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:56.030
every companion that you give offence to.

775
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:58.970
No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit

776
00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:00.700
offence to my inferiors.

777
00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.530
Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.

778
00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:03.770
Why, so I say.

779
00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:06.030
Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?

780
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:07.970
A stranger, and I not know on't!

781
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:10.530
There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought,

782
00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.770
one of Leonatus' friends.

783
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:17.570
Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,

784
00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:21.200
whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?

785
00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.870
One of your lordship's pages.

786
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:26.570
Is it fit I went to look upon him?

787
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.030
is there no derogation in't?

788
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:31.730
You cannot derogate, my lord.

789
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:33.900
Not easily, I think.

790
00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:39.900
Come, I'll go see this Italian: Come, go.

791
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.800
I'll attend your lordship.

792
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:47.300
That such a crafty devil as is his mother

793
00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:51.070
Should yield the world this ass! a woman that

794
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:54.400
Bears all down with her brain; and this her son

795
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.200
Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,

796
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.230
And leave eighteen.

797
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:04.530
Who's there? my woman Helen?

798
00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:06.370
Please you, madam

799
00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:08.900
What hour is it?

800
00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.630
Almost midnight, madam.

801
00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:17.030
I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:

802
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:21.830
Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:

803
00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:33.130
Take not away the taper, leave it burning;

804
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:41.430
And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,

805
00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:43.930
I prithee, call me.

806
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:47.900
Sleep hath seized me wholly

807
00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:56.930
To your protection I commend me, gods.

808
00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.730
From fairies and the tempters of the night

809
00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:06.730
Guard me, beseech ye.

810
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.930
The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense

811
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:40.930
Repairs itself by rest.

812
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:51.530
Our Tarquin thus

813
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:55.270
Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd

814
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:58.230
The chastity he wounded.

815
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:03.070
Cytherea,

816
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:11.000
How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,

817
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:19.770
And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!

818
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:38.770
But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,

819
00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:45.330
How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that

820
00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:50.900
Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper

821
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:54.700
Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,

822
00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.300
To see the enclosed lights, now canopied

823
00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.300
Under these windows, white and azure laced

824
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:09.600
With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,

825
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.630
To note the chamber: I will write all down:

826
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:28.200
Such and such pictures; there the window;

827
00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:35.500
such the adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,

828
00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:43.230
Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.

829
00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:49.700
Ah, but some natural notes about her body,

830
00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.730
Above ten thousand meaner moveables

831
00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:54.570
Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.

832
00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:16.000
O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!

833
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.500
And be her sense but as a monument,

834
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.500
Thus in a chapel lying!

835
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:36.170
Come off, come off:

836
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:39.000
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!

837
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.000
'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,

838
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.370
As strongly as the conscience does within,

839
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:50.870
To the madding of her lord.

840
00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:01.470
On her left breast

841
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:05.400
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops

842
00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:11.070
I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,

843
00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.500
Stronger than ever law could make:

844
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:16.270
this secret will force him think

845
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:18.300
I have pick'd the lock and ta'en

846
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.970
The treasure of her honour.

847
00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:29.200
No more. To what end?

848
00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.300
Why should I write this down, that's riveted,

849
00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.300
Screw'd to my memory?

850
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:45.370
She hath been reading late

851
00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:54.100
The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down

852
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:57.930
Where Philomel gave up.

853
00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.530
I have enough:

854
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:09.400
To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.

855
00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:14.630
Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning

856
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:17.000
May bare the raven's eye!

857
00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:21.470
I lodge in fear;

858
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:28.570
Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.

859
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.470
(Clock strikes)

860
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:41.170
One, two, three: time, time!

861
00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:57.670
It's almost morning, is't not?

862
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:58.670
Day, my lord.

863
00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:00.400
I am advised to give this foolish Imogen

864
00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.000
music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate.

865
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.770
Come on; tune: if you can penetrate her

866
00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:10.330
with your fingering, so; we'll try with tongue too:

867
00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:36.870
♪ Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,

868
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:45.830

00:46:55.870 --> 00:47:09.900
And Phoebus 'gins arise,

And winking Mary-buds begin

To ope their golden eyes:

With every thing that pretty is,

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:40.870

Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?

878
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:22.300
Will she not forth?

879
00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.800
I have assailed her with music,

880
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.070
but she vouchsafes no notice.

881
00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:28.530
The exile of her minion is too new;

882
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:30.630
She hath not yet forgot him: some more time

883
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:34.130
Must wear the print of his remembrance out,

884
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:38.600
And then she's yours.

885
00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.700
You are most bound to the king,

886
00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:46.770
Who lets go by no vantages that may

887
00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:49.570
Prefer you to his daughter.

888
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:54.200
So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;

889
00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.600
The one is Caius Lucius.

890
00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.330
A worthy fellow,

891
00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:01.230
Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;

892
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:03.770
But that's no fault of his:

893
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:05.770
Our dear son,

894
00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:08.700
When you have given good morning to your mistress,

895
00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:11.430
Attend the queen and us; we shall have need

896
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:17.500
To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.

897
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:20.430
If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,

898
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:22.330
Let her lie still and dream.

899
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:28.130
By your leave, ho!

900
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:33.300
Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.

901
00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:36.570
Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains

902
00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:38.470
For purchasing but trouble; the thanks I give

903
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:40.800
Is telling you that I am poor of thanks

904
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.370
And scarce can spare them.

905
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:44.100
Still, I swear I love you.

906
00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:45.870
If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me:

907
00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:47.730
If you swear still, your recompense is still

908
00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:49.770
That I regard it not.

909
00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:52.000
This is no answer.

910
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.200
But that you shall not say I yield being silent,

911
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:59.130
I would not speak. I pray you, spare me: 'faith,

912
00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:00.700
I shall unfold equal discourtesy

913
00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:04.500
To your best kindness: one of your great knowing

914
00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.600
Should learn, being taught, forbearance.

915
00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.330
To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin:

916
00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:10.130
I will not.

917
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:12.330
Fools are not mad folks.

918
00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:13.270
Do you call me fool?

919
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:14.500
As I am mad, I do:

920
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:15.970
If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;

921
00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:20.630
That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,

922
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:22.700
You put me to forget a lady's manners,

923
00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:29.800
By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,

924
00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.970
That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,

925
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:39.170
By the very truth of it, I care not for you,

926
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:41.270
And am so near the lack of charity--

927
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:44.470
To accuse myself--I hate you; which I had rather

928
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:47.400
You felt than make't my boast.

929
00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:48.500
You sin against obedience,

930
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.970
which you owe your father.

931
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:53.070
For the contract you pretend with that base wretch,

932
00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:55.170
One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,

933
00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:59.170
With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none:

934
00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:01.130
And though it be allow'd in meaner parties--

935
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:03.700
Yet who than he more mean?--to knit their souls,

936
00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:05.670
On whom there is no more dependency

937
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:07.930
But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;

938
00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:09.470
Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement

939
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:12.000
by the consequence o' the crown, and must not soil

940
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.130
The precious note of it with a base slave.

941
00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:16.770
A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,

942
00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:20.170
A pantler, not so eminent.

943
00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:22.730
Profane fellow

944
00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:27.230
Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more

945
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:30.500
But what thou art besides, thou wert too base

946
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:36.200
To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,

947
00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.770
Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made

948
00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:40.800
Comparative for your virtues, to be styled

949
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.670
The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated

950
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:45.500
For being preferred so well.

951
00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:46.470
The south-fog rot him!

952
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:47.800
He never can meet more mischance than come

953
00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:53.930
To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,

954
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:57.830
That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer

955
00:51:57.830 --> 00:52:01.800
In my respect than all the hairs above thee,

956
00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:05.500
Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!

957
00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.170
'His garment!' Now the devil--

958
00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:08.700
To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--

959
00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:09.370
'His garment!'

960
00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:11.470
I am sprited with a fool.

961
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:16.100
Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman

962
00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.530
Search for a jewel that too casually

963
00:52:17.530 --> 00:52:20.230
Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,

964
00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:22.270
If I would lose it for a revenue

965
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:24.700
Of any king's in Europe. I do think

966
00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:26.370
I saw't this morning:

967
00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:31.070
confident I am Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:

968
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:35.200
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord

969
00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.600
That I kiss aught but he.

970
00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:37.370
'Twill not be lost.

971
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:38.730
I hope so: go and search.

972
00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:42.470
You have abused me:

973
00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:45.170
'His meanest garment!'

974
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:46.870
Ay, I said so, sir:

975
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:49.330
If you will make't an action, call witness to't.

976
00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:51.930
I will inform your father.

977
00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:53.300
Your mother too:

978
00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.670
She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,

979
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:59.700
But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,

980
00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:01.600
To the worst of discontent.

981
00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:06.330
I'll be revenged:

982
00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:09.670
'His meanest garment!' Well.

983
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:13.700
Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sure

984
00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.700
To win the king as I am bold her honour

985
00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.000
Will remain hers.

986
00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.870
What means do you make to him?

987
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:22.970
Not any, but abide the change of time,

988
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:25.000
Quake in the present winter's state and wish

989
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.100
That warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes,

990
00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:32.330
I barely gratify your love; they failing,

991
00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:34.130
I must die much your debtor.

992
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:36.630
Your very goodness and your company

993
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:41.970
O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king

994
00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:45.600
Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius

995
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:47.870
Will do's commission throughly: and I think

996
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:50.030
He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,

997
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:53.630
Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance

998
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:54.800
Is yet fresh in their grief.

999
00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.730
I do believe,

1000
00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:58.230
Statist though I am none, nor like to be,

1001
00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:00.900
That this will prove a war; and you shall hear

1002
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.900
The legions now in Gallia sooner landed

1003
00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.600
In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings

1004
00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.500
Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen

1005
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.530
Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar

1006
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:11.600
Smiled at their lack of skill, but found

1007
00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.100
their courage

1008
00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:15.900
Worthy his frowning at: their discipline,

1009
00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:17.970
Now mingled with their courages, will make known

1010
00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:19.470
To their approvers they are people such

1011
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:20.530
That mend upon the world.

1012
00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:21.830
See! Iachimo!

1013
00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:26.530
The swiftest harts have posted you by land;

1014
00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:28.800
And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,

1015
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.270
To make your vessel nimble.

1016
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:31.170
Welcome, sir.

1017
00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:32.630
I hope the briefness of your answer made

1018
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:34.500
The speediness of your return.

1019
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:36.330
Your lady

1020
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:38.200
Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.

1021
00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.270
And therewithal the best; or let her beauty

1022
00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:42.330
Look through a casement to allure false hearts

1023
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:43.470
And be false with them.

1024
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:44.600
Here are letters for you.

1025
00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:45.600
Their tenor good, I trust.

1026
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:46.870
'Tis very like.

1027
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:49.030
Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court

1028
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:50.200
When you were there?

1029
00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:51.230
He was expected then,

1030
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:52.570
But not approach'd.

1031
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:55.430
All is well yet.

1032
00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:09.700
Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not

1033
00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:11.970
Too dull for your good wearing?

1034
00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:12.930
If I had lost it,

1035
00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:14.500
I should have lost the worth of it in gold.

1036
00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:19.400
I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy

1037
00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.970
A second night of such sweet shortness which

1038
00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:25.570
Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.

1039
00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:27.100
The stone's too hard to come by.

1040
00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:27.670
Not a whit,

1041
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:28.570
Your lady being so easy.

1042
00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:29.570
Make not, sir,

1043
00:55:29.570 --> 00:55:31.270
Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we

1044
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:32.900
Must not continue friends.

1045
00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:33.970
Good sir, we must,

1046
00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:37.930
If you keep covenant. Had I not brought

1047
00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:39.400
The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant

1048
00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.030
We were to question further: but I now

1049
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:44.170
Profess myself the winner of her honour,

1050
00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:46.830
Together with your ring; and not the wronger

1051
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:48.630
Of her or you, having proceeded but

1052
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:50.030
By both your wills.

1053
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:51.170
If you can make't apparent

1054
00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:55.630
That you have tasted her in bed, my hand

1055
00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:58.400
And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion

1056
00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.770
You had of her pure honour gains or loses

1057
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:02.970
Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both

1058
00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:03.800
To who shall find them.

1059
00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.000
Sir, my circumstances,

1060
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.370
Being so near the truth as I will make them,

1061
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:09.470
Must first induce you to believe: whose strength

1062
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:13.430
I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,

1063
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:15.070
You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find

1064
00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:16.500
You need it not.

1065
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.230
Proceed.

1066
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:21.130
First, her bedchamber,--

1067
00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:24.100
Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess

1068
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.970
Had that was well worth watching--it was hang'd

1069
00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:29.530
With tapesty of silk and silver; the story

1070
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:33.200
Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,

1071
00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:36.000
And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for

1072
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.200
The press of boats or pride: a piece of work

1073
00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:42.000
So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive

1074
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.030
In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd

1075
00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:47.400
Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,

1076
00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.570
Since the true life on't was--

1077
00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:50.200
This is true;

1078
00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:53.730
And this you might have heard of here, by me,

1079
00:56:53.730 --> 00:56:55.430
Or by some other.

1080
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:56.070
More particulars

1081
00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:57.000
Must justify my knowledge.

1082
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:57.670
So they must,

1083
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:59.470
Or do your honour injury.

1084
00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:00.530
The chimney

1085
00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:03.230
Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece

1086
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:07.930
Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures

1087
00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:11.370
So likely to report themselves: the cutter

1088
00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:15.600
Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,

1089
00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:18.430
Motion and breath left out.

1090
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:19.400
This is a thing

1091
00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:21.300
Which you might from relation likewise reap,

1092
00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:23.470
Being, as it is, much spoke of.

1093
00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:26.770
The roof o' the chamber

1094
00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:30.430
With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--

1095
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:33.200
I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids

1096
00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.600
Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely

1097
00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.600
Depending on their brands.

1098
00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:39.400
This is her honour!

1099
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:44.770
Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise

1100
00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:47.730
Be given to your remembrance--the description

1101
00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:49.500
Of what is in her chamber nothing saves

1102
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:52.030
The wager you have laid.

1103
00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:53.030
Then, if you can,

1104
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:57.830
Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!

1105
00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:00.830
And now 'tis up again: it must be married

1106
00:58:00.830 --> 00:58:02.430
To that your diamond; I'll keep them.

1107
00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:03.970
Jove!

1108
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:10.330
Once more let me behold it:

1109
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:16.900
is it that which I left with her?

1110
00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:20.270
Sir--I thank her--that:

1111
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:25.630
She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;

1112
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:29.370
Her pretty action did outsell her gift,

1113
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:32.770
And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said

1114
00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:34.770
She prized it once.

1115
00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:37.900
May be she pluck'd it off

1116
00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:39.230
To send it me.

1117
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:41.070
She writes so to you, doth she?

1118
00:58:55.530 --> 00:59:06.130
O, no, no, no! 'tis true.

1119
00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:10.030
Here, take this too;

1120
00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:14.600
It is a basilisk unto mine eye,

1121
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:20.670
Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour

1122
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:27.970
Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,

1123
00:59:27.970 --> 00:59:30.470
Where there's another man: the vows of women

1124
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:32.700
Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,

1125
00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:36.600
Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing.

1126
00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.470
O, above measure false!

1127
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:40.670
Have patience, sir,

1128
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:44.800
And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:

1129
00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:47.370
It may be probable she lost it;

1130
00:59:47.370 --> 00:59:49.870
or who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,

1131
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:51.730
Hath stol'n it from her?

1132
00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.400
Very true;

1133
00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:02.100
And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:

1134
01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:08.930
Render to me some corporal sign about her,

1135
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:13.630
More evident than this; for this was stolen.

1136
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:19.070
By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.

1137
01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:25.170
Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.

1138
01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:34.370
'Tis true:--nay, keep the ring--'tis true: I am sure

1139
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:38.470
She would not lose it: her attendants are all

1140
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:43.170
sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!

1141
01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:49.430
And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her:

1142
01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:53.500
The cognizance of her incontinency

1143
01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:58.400
Is this: she hath bought the name of whore

1144
01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.730
thus dearly.

1145
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:04.870
There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell

1146
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:05.970
Divide themselves between you!

1147
01:01:05.970 --> 01:01:07.700
Sir, be patient:

1148
01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.770
This is not strong enough to be believed

1149
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:11.030
Of one persuaded well of--

1150
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.730
Never talk on't;

1151
01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:13.600
She hath been colted by him.

1152
01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.530
If you seek

1153
01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:16.930
For further satisfying, under her breast--

1154
01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:23.900
Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud

1155
01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.100
Of that most delicate lodging:

1156
01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:29.700
I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger

1157
01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:33.670
To feed again, though full. You do remember

1158
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:34.730
This stain upon her?

1159
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:37.330
Ay, and it doth confirm

1160
01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:39.670
Another stain, as big as hell can hold,

1161
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:41.630
Were there no more but it.

1162
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:42.630
Will you hear more?

1163
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:48.800
Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;

1164
01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.700
Once, and a million!

1165
01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:50.300
I'll be sworn--

1166
01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:52.200
No swearing.

1167
01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:56.200
If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;

1168
01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.130
And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny

1169
01:01:58.130 --> 01:01:59.600
Thou'st made me cuckold.

1170
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.700
I'll deny nothing.

1171
01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:05.270
O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!

1172
01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:17.200
I will go there and do't, i' the court,

1173
01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:24.230
before her father. I'll do something--

1174
01:02:35.830 --> 01:02:36.900
Quite besides

1175
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:43.130
The government of patience! You have won:

1176
01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.770
Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath

1177
01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:49.600
He hath against himself.

1178
01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:53.970
With all my heart.

1179
01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:59.300
Is there no way for men to be but women

1180
01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:05.300
Must be half-workers? We are all bastards;

1181
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:10.370
And that most venerable man which I

1182
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.830
Did call my father, was I know not where

1183
01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:19.970
When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools

1184
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:25.270
Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd

1185
01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:29.330
The Dian of that time so doth my wife

1186
01:03:29.330 --> 01:03:41.200
The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!

1187
01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.630
Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd

1188
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:47.700
And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with

1189
01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:51.170
A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't

1190
01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:55.830
Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her

1191
01:03:55.830 --> 01:04:02.300
As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!

1192
01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:10.600
This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,--wast not?--

1193
01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:17.100
Or less,--at first?--perchance he spoke not, but,

1194
01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:21.330
Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,

1195
01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:26.930
Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition

1196
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:29.100
But what he look'd for should oppose and she

1197
01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:35.570
Should from encounter guard. Could I find out

1198
01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:40.370
The woman's part in me! For there's no motion

1199
01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:44.930
That tends to vice in man, but I affirm

1200
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:50.770
It is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,

1201
01:04:50.770 --> 01:04:56.670
The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;

1202
01:04:56.670 --> 01:05:02.170
Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;

1203
01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:05.030
Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,

1204
01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:07.270
Nice longing, slanders, mutability,

1205
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:10.030
All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,

1206
01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:16.270
Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all;

1207
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
For even to vice

1208
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.670
They are not constant but are changing still

1209
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:21.470
One vice, but of a minute old, for one

1210
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:27.570
Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,

1211
01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:34.800
Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill

1212
01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.970
In a true hate, to pray they have their will:

1213
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:43.970
The very devils cannot plague them better.

1214
01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:51.070
Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?

1215
01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:55.330
When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet

1216
01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:59.400
Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues

1217
01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:03.400
Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain

1218
01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.870
And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--

1219
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:08.900
Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less

1220
01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.830
Than in his feats deserving it--for him

1221
01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:14.930
And his succession granted Rome a tribute,

1222
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:19.930
Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately

1223
01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:22.230
Is left untender'd.

1224
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:24.600
And, to kill the marvel,

1225
01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:27.170
Shall be so ever.

1226
01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:27.970
There be many Caesars,

1227
01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:30.570
Ere such another Julius. Britain is

1228
01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:33.430
A world by itself; and we will nothing pay

1229
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:35.370
For wearing our own noses.

1230
01:06:35.370 --> 01:06:36.430
That opportunity

1231
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:39.830
Which then they had to take from 's, to resume

1232
01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:44.130
We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,

1233
01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:46.200
The kings your ancestors, together with

1234
01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.630
The natural bravery of your isle, which stands

1235
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:51.930
As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in

1236
01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:57.570
With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,

1237
01:06:57.570 --> 01:07:00.130
With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,

1238
01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:05.430
But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest

1239
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:09.030
Caesar made here; but made not here his brag

1240
01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:13.100
Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--

1241
01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:15.800
That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried

1242
01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:20.300
From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--

1243
01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:24.200
Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,

1244
01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:28.670
Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd

1245
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:32.430
As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof

1246
01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:35.570
The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--

1247
01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:40.030
O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,

1248
01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:43.070
Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright

1249
01:07:43.070 --> 01:07:45.630
And Britons strut with courage.

1250
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:48.670
Come, there's no more tribute to be paid:

1251
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:51.200
our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,

1252
01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.730
as I said, there is no moe such Caesars:

1253
01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:57.270
other of them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such

1254
01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:59.130
straight arms, none.

1255
01:07:59.130 --> 01:08:01.100
Son, let your mother end.

1256
01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.830
We have yet many among us can gripe as hard

1257
01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:08.600
as Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a hand.

1258
01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:12.630
Why tribute? why should we pay tribute?

1259
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:14.970
If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket,

1260
01:08:14.970 --> 01:08:16.970
or put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute

1261
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:21.300
for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.

1262
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:24.500
You must know,

1263
01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:29.600
Till the injurious Romans did extort

1264
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.970
This tribute from us, we were free:

1265
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:38.070
Caesar's ambition,

1266
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:41.500
Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch

1267
01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:45.470
The sides o' the world, against all colour here

1268
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:49.030
Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off

1269
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:51.400
Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon

1270
01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.230
Ourselves to be.

1271
01:08:53.230 --> 01:08:54.700
I am sorry, Cymbeline,

1272
01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:57.500
That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--

1273
01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:00.230
Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than

1274
01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:04.630
Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy:

1275
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:12.930
Receive it from me, then: war and confusion

1276
01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:16.170
In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee:

1277
01:09:16.170 --> 01:09:19.270
look for fury not to be resisted.

1278
01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:25.600
Thus defied, I thank thee for myself.

1279
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.530
How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not

1280
01:09:31.530 --> 01:09:35.930
What monster's her accuser? Leonatus,

1281
01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:40.000
O master! what a strange infection

1282
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.730
Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,

1283
01:09:43.730 --> 01:09:45.700
As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd

1284
01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:51.230
On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:

1285
01:09:51.230 --> 01:09:52.700
She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,

1286
01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:54.730
More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults

1287
01:09:54.730 --> 01:09:59.070
As would take in some virtue. O my master!

1288
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:03.400
Thy mind to her is now as low as were

1289
01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:18.800
Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?

1290
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:24.230
Upon the love and truth and vows which I

1291
01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:31.470
Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?

1292
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:39.270
If it be so to do good service, never

1293
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:44.500
Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,

1294
01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:45.970
That I should seem to lack humanity

1295
01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:48.300
so much as this fact comes to?

1296
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:51.330
'Do't: the letter

1297
01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:53.570
that I have sent her, by her own command

1298
01:10:53.570 --> 01:11:01.330
Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!

1299
01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:06.670
Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,

1300
01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:09.570
Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st

1301
01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:13.600
So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.

1302
01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.400
I am ignorant in what I am commanded.

1303
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:17.670
How now, Pisanio!

1304
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:24.900
Madam, here is a letter from my lord.

1305
01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.900
'Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me

1306
01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:36.870
in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me,

1307
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:38.570
as you, O the dearest of creatures,

1308
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:41.970
would even renew me with your eyes.

1309
01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:46.730
Take notice that I am in Cambria,

1310
01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:52.070
at Milford-Haven: what your own love

1311
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:53.600
will out of this advise you, follow.

1312
01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.430
So he wishes you all happiness,

1313
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:57.630
that remains loyal to his vow, and your,

1314
01:11:57.630 --> 01:11:59.000
increasing in love,

1315
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.770
LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'

1316
01:12:04.930 --> 01:12:10.200
O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?

1317
01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:15.030
He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me

1318
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:17.070
How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs

1319
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:18.900
May plod it in a week, why may not I

1320
01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.500
Glide thither in a day?

1321
01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:23.570
Prithee, speak,

1322
01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:25.470
How many score of miles may we well ride

1323
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:26.830
'Twixt hour and hour?

1324
01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:28.500
One score 'twixt sun and sun,

1325
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.530
Madam, 's enough for you:

1326
01:12:29.530 --> 01:12:31.200
and too much too.

1327
01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.630
Why, one that rode to's execution, man,

1328
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:34.270
Could never go so slow:

1329
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:37.170
But this is foolery:

1330
01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:39.400
Go bid my woman feign a sickness;

1331
01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.930
say she'll home to her father: and provide me presently

1332
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:44.670
A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit

1333
01:12:44.670 --> 01:12:46.230
A franklin's housewife.

1334
01:12:46.230 --> 01:12:49.800
Madam, you're best consider.

1335
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.170
I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,

1336
01:12:53.170 --> 01:12:55.700
Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,

1337
01:12:55.700 --> 01:13:00.670
That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;

1338
01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:02.730
Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,

1339
01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:05.530
Accessible is none but Milford way.

1340
01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:21.300
A goodly day not to keep house, with such

1341
01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:25.900
Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate

1342
01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.830
Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you

1343
01:13:28.830 --> 01:13:31.630
To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs

1344
01:13:31.630 --> 01:13:35.230
Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through

1345
01:13:35.230 --> 01:13:37.700
And keep their impious turbans on, without

1346
01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:41.700
Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!

1347
01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:45.070
Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;

1348
01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:47.170
Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats.

1349
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:51.600
Consider, when you above perceive me like a crow,

1350
01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:55.400
That it is place which lessens and sets off;

1351
01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:57.400
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you

1352
01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.570
Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:

1353
01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:05.770
Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,

1354
01:14:05.770 --> 01:14:08.670
Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not

1355
01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:13.130
What air's from home. Haply this life is best,

1356
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:16.100
If quiet life be best; sweeter to you

1357
01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:18.670
That have a sharper known; well corresponding

1358
01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:21.930
With your stiff age: but unto us it is

1359
01:14:21.930 --> 01:14:24.930
A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;

1360
01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:26.830
A prison for a debtor, that not dares

1361
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:28.500
To stride a limit.

1362
01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:29.430
What should we speak of

1363
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:32.270
When we are old as you? when we shall hear

1364
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:35.300
The rain and wind beat dark December, how,

1365
01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.630
In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse

1366
01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:41.970
The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;

1367
01:14:41.970 --> 01:14:43.770
We are beastly.

1368
01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:46.230
How you speak!

1369
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:49.500
Did you but know the city's usuries

1370
01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:53.370
And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court

1371
01:14:53.370 --> 01:14:57.130
As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb

1372
01:14:57.130 --> 01:15:00.670
Is certain falling, or so slippery that

1373
01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:06.230
The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,

1374
01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:09.200
O boys, this story

1375
01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:13.830
The world may read in me: my body's mark'd

1376
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:16.100
With Roman swords, and my report was once

1377
01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:19.370
First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,

1378
01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:21.170
And when a soldier was the theme, my name

1379
01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:25.770
Was not far off: then was I as a tree

1380
01:15:25.770 --> 01:15:30.630
Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,

1381
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:34.330
A storm or robbery, call it what you will,

1382
01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:38.470
Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,

1383
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:40.470
And left me bare to weather.

1384
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:41.530
Uncertain favour!

1385
01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:45.170
My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--

1386
01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:48.200
But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd

1387
01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:51.670
Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline

1388
01:15:51.670 --> 01:15:56.130
I was confederate with the Romans: so

1389
01:15:56.130 --> 01:16:00.170
Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years

1390
01:16:00.170 --> 01:16:03.830
This rock and these demesnes have been my world;

1391
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.870
But up to the mountains!

1392
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:07.700
This is not hunters' language:

1393
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:23.470
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!

1394
01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:28.400
These boys know little they are sons to the king;

1395
01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:32.230
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.

1396
01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.930
They think they are mine;

1397
01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.630
This Polydore,

1398
01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:43.430
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who

1399
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:46.770
The king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!

1400
01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:52.570
When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell

1401
01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:56.430
The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out

1402
01:16:56.430 --> 01:17:01.030
Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,

1403
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:03.830
And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then

1404
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:06.900
The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,

1405
01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:09.430
Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture

1406
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:19.200
That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,

1407
01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:23.500
Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,

1408
01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:28.670
Strikes life into my speech and shows much more

1409
01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:37.870
His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!

1410
01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:47.230
O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows

1411
01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:51.800
Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,

1412
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.570
At three and two years old, I stole these babes;

1413
01:17:54.570 --> 01:17:56.730
Thinking to bar thee of succession,

1414
01:17:56.730 --> 01:18:00.430
as Thou reft'st me of my lands.

1415
01:18:03.630 --> 01:18:07.770
Euriphile, Thou wast their nurse;

1416
01:18:07.770 --> 01:18:11.530
they took thee for their mother,

1417
01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:14.770
And every day do honour to her grave:

1418
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:24.330
Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,

1419
01:18:25.230 --> 01:18:28.730
They take for natural father.

1420
01:18:31.670 --> 01:18:33.270
The game is up.

1421
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:40.930
Where is Posthumus?

1422
01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:47.000
What is in thy mind,

1423
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.830
That makes thee stare thus?

1424
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.930
One, but painted thus,

1425
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:52.300
Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd

1426
01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.170
Beyond self-explication:

1427
01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:55.570
What's the matter. man?

1428
01:18:56.970 --> 01:18:58.400
Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with

1429
01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:03.700
A look untender?

1430
01:19:04.930 --> 01:19:06.400
My husband's hand!

1431
01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:11.170
That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,

1432
01:19:11.170 --> 01:19:14.630
And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue

1433
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:16.330
May take off some extremity, which to read

1434
01:19:16.330 --> 01:19:18.000
Would be even mortal to me.

1435
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.230
Please you, read;

1436
01:19:19.230 --> 01:19:21.400
And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing

1437
01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.730
The most disdain'd of fortune.

1438
01:19:28.570 --> 01:19:31.500
'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played

1439
01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:36.730
the strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof

1440
01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:42.130
lie bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,

1441
01:19:42.130 --> 01:19:45.170
but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain

1442
01:19:45.170 --> 01:19:50.070
as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,

1443
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:53.000
must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with

1444
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away

1445
01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
her life:

1446
01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:08.230
I shall give thee opportunity

1447
01:20:08.230 --> 01:20:12.630
at Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose

1448
01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:14.800
where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain

1449
01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:18.670
it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour

1450
01:20:18.670 --> 01:20:20.830
and equally to me disloyal.'

1451
01:20:23.370 --> 01:20:26.830
What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper

1452
01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:28.930
Hath cut her throat already.

1453
01:20:28.930 --> 01:20:34.630
False to his bed! What is it to be false?

1454
01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:39.500
To lie in watch there and to think on him?

1455
01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:43.800
To weep 'twixt clock and clock?

1456
01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:45.630
if sleep charge nature,

1457
01:20:45.630 --> 01:20:48.330
To break it with a fearful dream of him

1458
01:20:48.330 --> 01:20:50.770
And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?

1459
01:20:50.770 --> 01:20:51.700
Alas, good lady!

1460
01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:59.800
I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,

1461
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:03.800
Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;

1462
01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:08.430
Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks

1463
01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:10.270
Thy favour's good enough.

1464
01:21:12.130 --> 01:21:15.970
Some jay of Italy

1465
01:21:15.970 --> 01:21:19.630
Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:

1466
01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.930
Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;

1467
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:29.870
And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,

1468
01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:34.870
I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,

1469
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:39.370
Men's vows are women's traitors!

1470
01:21:42.770 --> 01:21:43.700
All good seeming,

1471
01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:46.430
By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought

1472
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:48.870
Put on for villany; not born where't grows,

1473
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:50.570
But worn a bait for ladies.

1474
01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:51.300
Good madam, hear me.

1475
01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:52.430
Come, fellow, be thou honest:

1476
01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:57.470
Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,

1477
01:21:58.370 --> 01:22:01.370
A little witness my obedience: look!

1478
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:03.030
I draw the sword myself: take it,

1479
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:05.830
and hit the innocent mansion of my love, my heart;

1480
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:07.630
Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;

1481
01:22:07.630 --> 01:22:09.170
Thy master is not there, who was indeed

1482
01:22:09.170 --> 01:22:11.170
The riches of it:

1483
01:22:13.330 --> 01:22:16.170
do his bidding; strike!

1484
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:19.070
Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;

1485
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:20.770
But now thou seem'st a coward.

1486
01:22:22.670 --> 01:22:24.530
Hence, vile instrument!

1487
01:22:25.330 --> 01:22:26.970
Thou shalt not damn my hand.

1488
01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:32.730
Why, I must die;

1489
01:22:34.630 --> 01:22:36.130
And if I do not by thy hand, thou art

1490
01:22:36.130 --> 01:22:39.170
No servant of thy master's.

1491
01:22:39.170 --> 01:22:40.770
Come, here's my heart.

1492
01:22:42.970 --> 01:22:49.500
Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;

1493
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.930
Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?

1494
01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:59.830
The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,

1495
01:22:59.830 --> 01:23:08.870
All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,

1496
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:13.400
Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more

1497
01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:19.030
Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools

1498
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:21.130
Believe false teachers:

1499
01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:24.630
though those that are betray'd

1500
01:23:24.630 --> 01:23:27.030
Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor

1501
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:29.300
Stands in worse case of woe.

1502
01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:35.170
And thou, Posthumus,

1503
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:43.330
Come, strike!

1504
01:23:44.970 --> 01:23:50.470
The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?

1505
01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:56.400
Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,

1506
01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.200
When I desire it too.

1507
01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:02.200
O gracious lady,

1508
01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:05.870
Since I received command to do this business

1509
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:08.270
I have not slept one wink.

1510
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:10.530
Do't, and to bed then.

1511
01:24:10.530 --> 01:24:13.230
I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.

1512
01:24:20.730 --> 01:24:22.630
Wherefore then didst undertake it?

1513
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.600
Why hast thou abused

1514
01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.170
So many miles with a pretence?

1515
01:24:29.170 --> 01:24:31.130
But to win time

1516
01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:35.000
To lose so bad employment; in the which

1517
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.570
I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,

1518
01:24:37.570 --> 01:24:38.800
Hear me with patience.

1519
01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.300
Talk thy tongue weary;

1520
01:24:42.170 --> 01:24:45.770
I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear

1521
01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:48.000
Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,

1522
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.870
Nor tent to bottom that.

1523
01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:55.430
But speak.

1524
01:24:56.330 --> 01:24:57.070
It cannot be

1525
01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:58.770
But that my master is abused:

1526
01:24:58.770 --> 01:25:01.900
Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.

1527
01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:03.330
Hath done you both this cursed injury.

1528
01:25:03.330 --> 01:25:04.830
Some Roman courtezan.

1529
01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:06.130
No, on my life.

1530
01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:11.430
I'll give but notice you are dead and send him

1531
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:13.600
Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded

1532
01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:16.670
I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,

1533
01:25:16.670 --> 01:25:18.270
And that will well confirm it.

1534
01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:24.170
What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?

1535
01:25:24.170 --> 01:25:27.100
Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven

1536
01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:31.570
To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind

1537
01:25:31.570 --> 01:25:34.770
Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise

1538
01:25:34.770 --> 01:25:36.800
That which, to appear itself, must not yet be

1539
01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:41.670
But by self-danger, you should tread a course

1540
01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:46.570
Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near

1541
01:25:46.570 --> 01:25:47.800
The residence of Posthumus;

1542
01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:50.970
O, for such means! I would adventure.

1543
01:25:50.970 --> 01:25:54.070
Well, then, here's the point:

1544
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:56.870
You must forget to be a woman;

1545
01:25:56.870 --> 01:26:02.900
change command into obedience: fear and niceness

1546
01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:04.230
into a waggish courage:

1547
01:26:04.230 --> 01:26:09.500
I see into thy end, and am almost

1548
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:11.330
A man already.

1549
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:14.430
First, make yourself but like one.

1550
01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:16.530
Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--

1551
01:26:16.530 --> 01:26:19.130
'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, all

1552
01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:20.730
That answer to them:

1553
01:26:20.730 --> 01:26:22.530
'fore noble Lucius

1554
01:26:22.530 --> 01:26:26.370
Present yourself, desire his service, tell him

1555
01:26:26.370 --> 01:26:27.370
wherein you're happy,

1556
01:26:27.370 --> 01:26:30.970
With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable

1557
01:26:30.970 --> 01:26:31.970
Thou art all the comfort

1558
01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:34.170
The gods will diet me with.

1559
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:43.000
This attempt I am soldier to, and will abide it

1560
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.930
with a prince's courage. Away, I prithee.

1561
01:26:51.570 --> 01:26:55.670
Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,

1562
01:26:56.930 --> 01:26:58.130
Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected

1563
01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:00.730
of your carriage from the court.

1564
01:27:01.170 --> 01:27:03.070
My noble mistress,

1565
01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:07.770
Here is a box; I had it from the queen:

1566
01:27:07.770 --> 01:27:12.030
What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,

1567
01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:14.800
Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this

1568
01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:17.330
Will drive away distemper.

1569
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:20.000
To some shade,

1570
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.330
And fit you to your manhood.

1571
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:27.270
May the gods direct you to the best!

1572
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:30.830
Amen: I thank thee.

1573
01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:07.400
Thanks, royal sir.

1574
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:11.330
My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence;

1575
01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:13.130
And am right sorry that I must report ye

1576
01:28:13.130 --> 01:28:14.630
My master's enemy.

1577
01:28:14.630 --> 01:28:16.300
Our subjects, sir,

1578
01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:20.100
Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself

1579
01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:24.200
To show less sovereignty than they, must needs

1580
01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.070
Appear unkinglike.

1581
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:29.030
So, sir: I desire of you

1582
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:31.370
A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.

1583
01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:35.200
Madam, all joy befal your grace!

1584
01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.400
And you!

1585
01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:40.000
My lords, you are appointed for that office;

1586
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.330
The due of honour in no point omit.

1587
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:47.770
So farewell, noble Lucius.

1588
01:28:49.230 --> 01:28:51.130
Your hand, my lord.

1589
01:28:51.130 --> 01:28:54.930
Receive it friendly; but from this time forth

1590
01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:56.630
I wear it as your enemy.

1591
01:28:56.630 --> 01:28:57.800
Sir, the event

1592
01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:01.430
Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.

1593
01:29:03.170 --> 01:29:05.630
Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,

1594
01:29:05.630 --> 01:29:11.170
Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!

1595
01:29:20.230 --> 01:29:23.170
He goes hence frowning: but it honours us

1596
01:29:23.170 --> 01:29:24.900
That we have given him cause.

1597
01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:26.830
'Tis all the better;

1598
01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:29.170
Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.

1599
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:32.000
Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor

1600
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.530
How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely

1601
01:29:34.530 --> 01:29:37.400
Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:

1602
01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.470
The powers that he already hath in Gallia

1603
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:41.800
Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves

1604
01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.900
His war for Britain.

1605
01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:45.070
'Tis not sleepy business;

1606
01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:48.430
But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.

1607
01:29:48.430 --> 01:29:50.800
Our expectation that it would be thus

1608
01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:55.830
Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,

1609
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:58.300
Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd

1610
01:29:58.300 --> 01:29:59.930
Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd

1611
01:29:59.930 --> 01:30:01.270
The duty of the day: she looks us like

1612
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:04.230
A thing more made of malice than of duty:

1613
01:30:04.230 --> 01:30:06.900
We have noted it. Call her before us; for

1614
01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:09.630
We have been too slight in sufferance.

1615
01:30:09.630 --> 01:30:10.570
Royal sir,

1616
01:30:10.570 --> 01:30:12.200
Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired

1617
01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:14.530
Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,

1618
01:30:14.530 --> 01:30:17.170
'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,

1619
01:30:17.170 --> 01:30:20.270
Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady

1620
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:22.700
So tender of rebukes that words are strokes

1621
01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.270
And strokes death to her.

1622
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:25.070
Where is she, sir?

1623
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:26.600
How can her contempt be answer'd?

1624
01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:27.700
Please you, sir,

1625
01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:30.630
Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer

1626
01:30:30.630 --> 01:30:33.230
That will be given to the loudest noise we make.

1627
01:30:33.230 --> 01:30:34.970
My lord, when last I went to visit her,

1628
01:30:34.970 --> 01:30:37.170
She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,

1629
01:30:37.170 --> 01:30:39.130
Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,

1630
01:30:39.130 --> 01:30:41.330
She should that duty leave unpaid to you,

1631
01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:43.600
Which daily she was bound to proffer:

1632
01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:46.900
This she wish'd me to make known; but our great court

1633
01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:48.730
Made me to blame in memory.

1634
01:30:48.730 --> 01:30:50.330
Her doors lock'd?

1635
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:53.030
Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear

1636
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:54.300
Prove false!

1637
01:30:59.730 --> 01:31:02.300
Son, I say, follow the king.

1638
01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:09.300
That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,

1639
01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:11.430
have not seen these two days.

1640
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:14.530
Go, look after.

1641
01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:20.000
Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!

1642
01:31:21.530 --> 01:31:25.400
He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence

1643
01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:29.300
Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes

1644
01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:31.430
It is a thing most precious.

1645
01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:38.170
But for her, where is she gone?

1646
01:31:39.070 --> 01:31:42.300
Haply, despair hath seized her,

1647
01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:45.600
Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown

1648
01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:51.400
To her desired Posthumus: gone she is

1649
01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:55.970
To death or to dishonour; and my end

1650
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:58.530
Can make good use of either:

1651
01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:09.330
She being down, I have the placing of the British crown.

1652
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:12.630
How now, my son!

1653
01:32:12.630 --> 01:32:14.470
'Tis certain she is fled.

1654
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:16.330
Go in and cheer the king: he rages;

1655
01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:17.330
none dare come about him.

1656
01:32:17.330 --> 01:32:22.770
All the better: may this night forestall him

1657
01:32:22.770 --> 01:32:24.500
of the coming day!

1658
01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:33.030
I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,

1659
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:36.070
And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite

1660
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:42.170
Than lady, ladies, woman; from every one

1661
01:32:42.170 --> 01:32:47.400
The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,

1662
01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:53.330
Outsells them all; I love her therefore:

1663
01:32:56.170 --> 01:32:58.130
but disdaining me and throwing favours on

1664
01:32:58.130 --> 01:33:01.400
The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment

1665
01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:05.430
That what's else rare is choked; and in that point

1666
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:09.400
I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,

1667
01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:12.000
To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--

1668
01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:14.270
Who is here?

1669
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:19.970
What, are you packing, sirrah?

1670
01:33:22.570 --> 01:33:23.570
Come hither:

1671
01:33:32.530 --> 01:33:35.200
ah, you precious pander!

1672
01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:39.930
Villain, Where is thy lady? In a word; or else

1673
01:33:39.930 --> 01:33:41.800
Thou art straightway with the fiends.

1674
01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:42.800
O, good my lord!

1675
01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:46.870
Where is thy lady? Is she with Posthumus?

1676
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:48.770
From whose so many weights of baseness cannot

1677
01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:50.530
A dram of worth be drawn.

1678
01:33:50.530 --> 01:33:51.800
O, my all-worthy lord!

1679
01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:53.600
All-worthy villain!

1680
01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.470
Discover where thy mistress is at once,

1681
01:33:55.470 --> 01:33:59.230
At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'

1682
01:34:00.330 --> 01:34:03.600
Speak, or thy silence on the instant is

1683
01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:07.330
Thy condemnation and thy death.

1684
01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:11.400
Then, sir,

1685
01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.630
This paper is the history of my knowledge

1686
01:34:14.630 --> 01:34:15.900
Touching her flight.

1687
01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:19.630
Let's see't. I will pursue her

1688
01:34:19.630 --> 01:34:22.500
Even to Augustus' throne.

1689
01:34:24.230 --> 01:34:28.070
I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,

1690
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:31.670
Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!

1691
01:34:32.370 --> 01:34:35.670
Sirrah, is this letter true?

1692
01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:37.030
Sir, as I think.

1693
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:39.100
It is Posthumus' hand; I know't.

1694
01:34:43.130 --> 01:34:47.270
Sirrah, if thou wouldst not be a villain,

1695
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:49.770
but do me true service,

1696
01:34:49.770 --> 01:34:51.630
undergo those employments wherein I should have

1697
01:34:51.630 --> 01:34:55.200
cause to use thee with a serious industry,

1698
01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:57.870
that is, what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it

1699
01:34:57.870 --> 01:35:03.300
directly and truly, I would think thee an honest man:

1700
01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:04.800
thou shouldst neither want my means

1701
01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.430
for thy relief nor my voice for thy preferment.

1702
01:35:08.130 --> 01:35:10.270
Well, my good lord.

1703
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:12.930
Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently

1704
01:35:12.930 --> 01:35:15.670
and constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune

1705
01:35:15.670 --> 01:35:18.570
of that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not,

1706
01:35:18.570 --> 01:35:21.130
in the course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower

1707
01:35:21.130 --> 01:35:24.800
of mine: wilt thou serve me?

1708
01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:28.430
Sir, I will.

1709
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:35.230
Give me thy hand; here's my purse.

1710
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.700
Hast any of thy late master's garments in thy possession?

1711
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.630
I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit

1712
01:35:47.630 --> 01:35:50.170
he wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.

1713
01:35:50.170 --> 01:35:53.230
The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit hither:

1714
01:35:53.230 --> 01:35:56.970
let it be thy lint service; go.

1715
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:59.900
I shall, my lord.

1716
01:36:04.630 --> 01:36:06.570
Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--

1717
01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:10.400
I forgot to ask him one thing;

1718
01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:11.830
I'll remember't anon:--

1719
01:36:14.170 --> 01:36:19.270
even there, thou villain Posthumus, will I kill thee.

1720
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:21.770
I would these garments were come.

1721
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:24.230
She said upon a time--the bitterness of it

1722
01:36:24.230 --> 01:36:26.900
I now belch from my heart--that she

1723
01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:30.970
held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect

1724
01:36:30.970 --> 01:36:34.000
than my noble and natural person together

1725
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.970
with the adornment of my qualities.

1726
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:39.700
With that suit upon my back,

1727
01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:42.200
will I ravish her:

1728
01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.800
Be those the garments?

1729
01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.600
Ay, my noble lord.

1730
01:36:51.570 --> 01:36:54.270
How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?

1731
01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:57.270
She can scarce be there yet.

1732
01:36:57.900 --> 01:36:59.930
Bring this apparel to my chamber;

1733
01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:05.600
that is the second thing that I have commanded thee:

1734
01:37:06.930 --> 01:37:12.170
the third is,

1735
01:37:12.170 --> 01:37:16.470
that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design.

1736
01:37:21.670 --> 01:37:24.700
Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee

1737
01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:28.530
Were to prove false, which I will never be,

1738
01:38:52.230 --> 01:38:54.730
How fit his garments serve me.

1739
01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:56.730
Why should his mistress

1740
01:38:56.730 --> 01:38:58.400
who was made by him  that made the tailor

1741
01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:00.370
not be fit too?

1742
01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.800
I dare speak it to myself

1743
01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:05.000
where it is not vain glory

1744
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.500
for a man and his glass to confer

1745
01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:09.600
in his own chambers.

1746
01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:14.170
The lines of my body are as well-drawn as his,

1747
01:39:14.170 --> 01:39:16.870
no less young, more strong,

1748
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:18.900
not beneath him in fortunes,

1749
01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:21.600
beyond him in the advantage of the time

1750
01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.470
above him in birth

1751
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:25.530
alike conversant in general services

1752
01:39:25.530 --> 01:39:29.130
and more remarkable in single oppositions.

1753
01:39:30.170 --> 01:39:33.800
Yet this imperceiverant thing loves him in my despite.

1754
01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:36.100
What mortality is!

1755
01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:38.470
Stay; come not in.

1756
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:39.730
But that it eats our victuals, I should think

1757
01:39:39.730 --> 01:39:41.400
Here were a fairy.

1758
01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:42.670
What's the matter, sir?

1759
01:39:42.670 --> 01:39:44.500
By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,

1760
01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:46.970
An earthly paragon!

1761
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:53.100
Good masters, harm me not:

1762
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:59.070
I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found

1763
01:39:59.070 --> 01:40:03.900
Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:

1764
01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:08.900
I would have left it on the board so soon

1765
01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:10.330
As I had made my meal, and parted

1766
01:40:10.330 --> 01:40:11.800
With prayers for the provider.

1767
01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:13.870
Money, youth?

1768
01:40:15.730 --> 01:40:18.430
All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!

1769
01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:19.700
As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those

1770
01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:21.300
Who worship dirty gods.

1771
01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:23.070
I see you're angry:

1772
01:40:23.930 --> 01:40:27.100
Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should

1773
01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:28.970
Have died had I not made it.

1774
01:40:28.970 --> 01:40:30.770
Whither bound?

1775
01:40:30.770 --> 01:40:32.030
To Milford-Haven.

1776
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.900
What's your name?

1777
01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:34.400
Fidele, sir.

1778
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:39.400
I have a kinsman who Is bound for Italy;

1779
01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.570
he embark'd at Milford;

1780
01:40:40.570 --> 01:40:43.830
To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,

1781
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:45.730
I am fall'n in this offence.

1782
01:40:45.730 --> 01:40:46.730
Prithee, fair youth,

1783
01:40:46.730 --> 01:40:49.930
Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds

1784
01:40:49.930 --> 01:40:55.000
By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!

1785
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.100
'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer

1786
01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:01.630
Ere you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it.

1787
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:04.470
Boys, bid him welcome.

1788
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:07.230
I'll love him as my brother:

1789
01:41:07.230 --> 01:41:08.830
And such a welcome as I'd give to him

1790
01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:12.170
After long absence, such is yours: most welcome!

1791
01:41:12.730 --> 01:41:16.500
The night to the owl and morn to the lark

1792
01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:18.330
less welcome.

1793
01:41:18.770 --> 01:41:24.370
Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon

1794
01:41:24.370 --> 01:41:29.130
thy shoulders, shall within this hour be off;

1795
01:41:29.130 --> 01:41:31.070
thy mistress enforced;

1796
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:35.100
thy garments cut to pieces before thy face:

1797
01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:38.770
and all this done, spurn her home to her father;

1798
01:41:38.770 --> 01:41:40.430
who may haply be a little angry

1799
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:42.770
for my so rough usage;

1800
01:41:43.670 --> 01:41:47.800
but my mother, having power of his testiness,

1801
01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:49.930
shall turn all into my commendations.

1802
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:56.370
Out, sword, and to a sore purpose!

1803
01:41:56.370 --> 01:41:58.800
Fortune, put them into my hands!

1804
01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:04.400
You are not well: remain here in the cell;

1805
01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:06.330
We'll come to you after hunting.

1806
01:42:06.330 --> 01:42:08.200
Brother, stay here

1807
01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:09.530
Are we not brothers?

1808
01:42:12.130 --> 01:42:14.370
So man and man should be;

1809
01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:19.530
But clay and clay differs in dignity,

1810
01:42:19.530 --> 01:42:26.570
Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.

1811
01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:29.500
Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.

1812
01:42:30.130 --> 01:42:33.500
So sick I am not, yet I am not well;

1813
01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:34.870
But not so citizen a wanton as

1814
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:38.570
To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me;

1815
01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:40.430
Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom

1816
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:41.970
Is breach of all.

1817
01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:45.970
I am ill, but your being by me

1818
01:42:45.970 --> 01:42:50.230
Cannot amend me; society is no comfort

1819
01:42:50.230 --> 01:42:54.630
To one not sociable: I am not very sick,

1820
01:42:54.630 --> 01:42:58.270
Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:

1821
01:42:58.270 --> 01:43:03.730
I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,

1822
01:43:03.730 --> 01:43:05.670
Stealing so poorly.

1823
01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:08.600
Brother, farewell.

1824
01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.030
I wish ye sport.

1825
01:43:10.030 --> 01:43:12.800
You health. So please you, sir.

1826
01:43:24.730 --> 01:43:26.630
These are kind creatures.

1827
01:43:28.230 --> 01:43:32.570
Gods, what lies I have heard!

1828
01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:36.730
Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:

1829
01:43:36.730 --> 01:43:38.900
Experience, O, thou disprovest report!

1830
01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:46.900
The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish

1831
01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:49.800
Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.

1832
01:43:55.300 --> 01:44:01.430
I am sick still; heart-sick.

1833
01:44:03.630 --> 01:44:11.530
Pisanio, I'll now taste of thy drug.

1834
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:15.570
I cannot find those runagates;

1835
01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:23.170
That villian hath mocked me. I am faint!

1836
01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:32.800
What slave art thou?

1837
01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:33.800
Thou art a robber,

1838
01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:37.100
A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.

1839
01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:41.800
To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I

1840
01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:44.600
An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?

1841
01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:46.870
Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not

1842
01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:50.170
My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,

1843
01:44:50.170 --> 01:44:51.830
Why I should yield to thee?

1844
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:54.000
Thou villain base,

1845
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.670
Know'st me not by my clothes?

1846
01:44:57.770 --> 01:44:59.730
Thou art some fool;

1847
01:44:59.730 --> 01:45:01.300
I am loath to beat thee.

1848
01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:03.500
Thou injurious thief,

1849
01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:06.800
Hear but my name, and tremble.

1850
01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.070
What's thy name?

1851
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:10.330
Cloten, thou villain.

1852
01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:15.700
Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,

1853
01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:17.930
I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad,

1854
01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:19.070
or Adder, Spider,

1855
01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:20.230
'Twould move me sooner.

1856
01:45:20.230 --> 01:45:21.530
To thy further fear,

1857
01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:25.470
Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know

1858
01:45:25.470 --> 01:45:28.000
I am son to the queen.

1859
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.870
I am sorry for 't; not seeming

1860
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:32.130
So worthy as thy birth.

1861
01:45:32.130 --> 01:45:33.270
Art not afeard?

1862
01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:36.530
Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise:

1863
01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:39.000
At fools I laugh, not fear them.

1864
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.630
Die the death:

1865
01:45:43.730 --> 01:45:46.330
Yield, rustic mountaineer.

1866
01:45:50.530 --> 01:45:52.030
What hast thou done?

1867
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:59.870
I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,

1868
01:45:59.870 --> 01:46:03.000
Son to the queen, after his own report;

1869
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.530
Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore

1870
01:46:06.530 --> 01:46:09.030
With his own single hand he'ld take us in

1871
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:10.870
Displace our heads where--

1872
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:12.470
thank the gods!--they grow,

1873
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:14.230
And set them on Lud's-town.

1874
01:46:14.230 --> 01:46:16.230
We are all undone.

1875
01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:20.930
Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,

1876
01:46:20.930 --> 01:46:23.130
But that he swore to take, our lives?

1877
01:46:23.970 --> 01:46:27.030
The law protects not us: then why should we be tender

1878
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:30.370
To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,

1879
01:46:30.370 --> 01:46:32.570
Play judge and executioner all himself,

1880
01:46:32.570 --> 01:46:34.400
For we do fear the law?

1881
01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:38.930
What company discover you abroad?

1882
01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:39.870
No single soul

1883
01:46:39.870 --> 01:46:42.070
Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason

1884
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:44.000
He must have some attendants.

1885
01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:47.400
then on good ground we fear,

1886
01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:49.430
If we do fear this body hath a tail

1887
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:50.770
More perilous than the head.

1888
01:46:50.770 --> 01:46:51.630
Let ordinance

1889
01:46:51.630 --> 01:46:54.000
Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,

1890
01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.970
My brother hath done well.

1891
01:46:55.970 --> 01:46:56.970
I had no mind

1892
01:46:56.970 --> 01:46:58.930
To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness

1893
01:46:58.930 --> 01:47:01.130
Did make my way long forth.

1894
01:47:02.830 --> 01:47:03.900
With his own sword,

1895
01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:06.030
Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en

1896
01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:09.830
His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek

1897
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:13.100
And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:

1898
01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:15.430
That's all I reck.

1899
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:17.330
I fear 'twill be revenged:

1900
01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:22.530
Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't!

1901
01:47:22.530 --> 01:47:24.700
though valour becomes thee well enough.

1902
01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:25.870
Would I had done't

1903
01:47:25.870 --> 01:47:28.000
So the revenge alone pursued me!

1904
01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.800
Well, 'tis done:

1905
01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:33.270
We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger

1906
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:36.530
Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our cell;

1907
01:47:36.530 --> 01:47:38.900
Poor sick Fidele!

1908
01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:41.400
I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour

1909
01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:44.030
I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,

1910
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:46.700
And praise myself for charity.

1911
01:47:48.330 --> 01:47:50.600
O thou goddess,

1912
01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:55.030
Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st

1913
01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:57.800
In these two princely boys!

1914
01:47:58.500 --> 01:47:59.500
'Tis wonder

1915
01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:02.300
That an invisible instinct should frame them

1916
01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:05.300
To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,

1917
01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:08.470
Civility not seen from other,

1918
01:48:09.130 --> 01:48:13.770
valour that wildly grows in them, but yields a crop

1919
01:48:13.770 --> 01:48:16.130
As if it had been sow'd.

1920
01:48:16.130 --> 01:48:17.770
Where's my brother?

1921
01:48:19.230 --> 01:48:22.500
I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,

1922
01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:24.670
In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage

1923
01:48:24.670 --> 01:48:26.230
For his return.

1924
01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:29.370
(Solemn music plays)

1925
01:48:29.370 --> 01:48:32.100
My ingenious instrument!

1926
01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:36.670
Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasion

1927
01:48:36.670 --> 01:48:40.670
Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!

1928
01:48:42.130 --> 01:48:43.670
Is he at home?

1929
01:48:43.670 --> 01:48:46.500
He went hence even now.

1930
01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:50.130
What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother

1931
01:48:50.130 --> 01:48:53.130
it did not speak before.

1932
01:48:53.130 --> 01:48:57.970
All solemn things should answer solemn accidents.

1933
01:48:57.970 --> 01:48:59.730
The matter?

1934
01:48:59.730 --> 01:49:00.630

And cordial to me, have I not found it

O! Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,

2047
01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:19.870
O! Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,

Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!

2050
01:59:42.770 --> 01:59:45.330

01:59:45.330 --> 01:59:47.130
of this war's purpose?

2052
01:59:48.330 --> 01:59:52.370
Last night the very gods show'd me a vision--

2053
01:59:52.370 --> 01:59:59.230
I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus:

2054
01:59:59.230 --> 02:00:01.930
I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd

2055
02:00:01.930 --> 02:00:06.570
From the spongy south to this part of the west,

2056
02:00:06.570 --> 02:00:13.670
There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--

2057
02:00:13.670 --> 02:00:17.930
Unless my sins abuse my divination--

2058
02:00:17.930 --> 02:00:21.170
Success to the Roman host.

2059
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:24.200
Dream often so,

2060
02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:26.630
And never false.

2061
02:00:26.630 --> 02:00:29.300
Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her.

2062
02:00:43.970 --> 02:00:46.500
A fever with the absence of her son,

2063
02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:49.970
A madness, of which her life's in danger.

2064
02:00:55.700 --> 02:01:00.870

2065

2076
02:01:32.770 --> 02:01:35.300

you're ready:

2081
02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:41.800
The want is but to put those powers in motion

2082
02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:43.600
That long to move.

2083
02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:49.100
I thank you. Let's withdraw;

2084
02:01:49.470 --> 02:01:51.030
I heard no letter from my master since

2085
02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:55.730

Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise

2087
02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:00.830

Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.

2091

Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them

2094
02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:42.100

Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd

2097

2098

2099
02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:05.570
If each of you should take this course, how many

2100

No bond but to do just ones.

2108
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:43.130
Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,

2109
02:03:43.130 --> 02:03:48.000
You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,

2110
02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.600
To have them fall no more: you some permit

2111
02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:53.970
To second ills with ills, each elder worse,

2112
02:03:53.970 --> 02:03:57.530
And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.

2113
02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:04.670
But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,

2114
02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:09.200
And make me blest to obey!

2115
02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:13.300
I am brought hither

2116
02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:16.900
Among the Italian gentry, and to fight

2117
02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:19.830
Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough

2118
02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:24.930
That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!

2119
02:04:24.930 --> 02:04:27.370
I'll give no wound to thee.

2120
02:04:27.370 --> 02:04:28.930
Let's see the boy's face.

2121
02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:32.970
He's alive, my lord.

2122
02:04:32.970 --> 02:04:35.100
He'll then instruct us of this body.

2123
02:04:36.330 --> 02:04:40.130
Young one, inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems

2124
02:04:40.130 --> 02:04:43.330
They crave to be demanded. Who is this

2125
02:04:43.330 --> 02:04:45.270
Thou makest thy bloody pillow?

2126
02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:49.170
How came it? Who is it?

2127
02:04:49.170 --> 02:04:50.570
What art thou?

2128
02:04:51.770 --> 02:04:54.270
I am nothing: or if not,

2129
02:04:54.270 --> 02:04:57.100
Nothing to be were better.

2130
02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:00.970
I may wander

2131
02:05:00.970 --> 02:05:02.900
From east to occident,

2132
02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:10.400
Try many, all good, serve truly,

2133
02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:13.200
never find such another master.

2134
02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:15.230
'Lack, good youth!

2135
02:05:15.230 --> 02:05:17.600
Thou movest no less with thy complaining than

2136
02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:20.100
Thy master in bleeding:

2137
02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:21.230
Thy name?

2138
02:05:21.230 --> 02:05:22.770
Fidele, sir.

2139
02:05:22.770 --> 02:05:25.030
Thou dost approve thyself the very same:

2140
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:29.930
Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.

2141
02:05:34.130 --> 02:05:38.200
Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say

2142
02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:40.630
Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,

2143
02:05:40.630 --> 02:05:43.130
No less beloved.

2144
02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:48.230
I'll follow, sir.

2145
02:05:48.230 --> 02:05:50.470
So please you entertain me.

2146
02:05:50.470 --> 02:05:53.170
Ay, good youth!

2147
02:05:53.170 --> 02:05:56.430
And rather father thee than master thee.

2148
02:05:58.800 --> 02:05:59.700
I'll disrobe me

2149
02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:02.500
Of these Italian weeds and suit myself

2150
02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:05.600
As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight

2151
02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:08.700
Against the part I come with; so I'll die

2152
02:06:08.700 --> 02:06:13.200
For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life

2153
02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:17.770
Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,

2154
02:06:17.770 --> 02:06:20.730
Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril

2155
02:06:20.730 --> 02:06:23.130
Myself I'll dedicate.

2156
02:06:27.730 --> 02:06:29.470
Let me make men know

2157
02:06:29.470 --> 02:06:32.330
More valour in me than my habits show.

2158
02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:37.970
Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!

2159
02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:42.330
To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin

2160
02:06:42.330 --> 02:06:48.900
The fashion, less without and more within.

2161
02:06:49.970 --> 02:06:52.170
The noise is round about us.

2162
02:06:53.130 --> 02:06:54.200
Let us from it.

2163
02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:55.430
What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it

2164
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:56.870
From action and adventure?

2165
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:57.430
Nay, what hope

2166
02:06:57.430 --> 02:06:58.630
Have we in hiding us?

2167
02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:02.270
We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.

2168
02:07:02.570 --> 02:07:04.830
To the king's party there's no going:

2169
02:07:04.830 --> 02:07:06.170
This is, sir, a doubt

2170
02:07:06.170 --> 02:07:08.600
In such a time nothing becoming you,

2171
02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:09.970
Nor satisfying us.

2172
02:07:09.970 --> 02:07:11.770
It is not likely

2173
02:07:11.770 --> 02:07:14.070
That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,

2174
02:07:14.070 --> 02:07:16.400
Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes

2175
02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:18.900
And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,

2176
02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:21.200
That they will waste their time upon our note,

2177
02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:23.100
To know from whence we are.

2178
02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:24.030
O, I am known

2179
02:07:24.030 --> 02:07:25.970
Of many in the army: many years,

2180
02:07:25.970 --> 02:07:27.770
Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him

2181
02:07:27.770 --> 02:07:29.630
From my remembrance.

2182
02:07:32.570 --> 02:07:34.530
Pray, sir, to the army:

2183
02:07:34.530 --> 02:07:37.370
I and my brother are not known; yourself

2184
02:07:37.370 --> 02:07:39.400
So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,

2185
02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:40.900
Cannot be question'd.

2186
02:07:40.900 --> 02:07:42.030
By this sun that shines,

2187
02:07:42.030 --> 02:07:44.600
I'll thither: what thing is it that I never

2188
02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:48.600
Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,

2189
02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:51.970
But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!

2190
02:07:51.970 --> 02:07:54.100
Never bestrid a horse, save one that had

2191
02:07:54.100 --> 02:07:55.600
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel

2192
02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:59.200
Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed

2193
02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:01.870
To look upon the holy sun, to have

2194
02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:04.470
The benefit of his blest beams, remaining

2195
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:08.330
So long a poor unknown.

2196
02:08:08.330 --> 02:08:10.130
By heavens, I'll go:

2197
02:08:11.230 --> 02:08:13.100
If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,

2198
02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:17.000
I'll take the better care, but if you will not,

2199
02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.900
The hazard therefore due fall on me

2200
02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:20.730
by the hands of Romans!

2201
02:08:20.730 --> 02:08:22.430
So say I amen.

2202
02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:31.670
No reason I, since of your lives you set

2203
02:08:31.670 --> 02:08:35.870
So slight a valuation, should reserve

2204
02:08:35.870 --> 02:08:42.500
My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!

2205
02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:45.800
If in your country wars you chance to die,

2206
02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:49.400
That is my bed too, lads, an there I'll lie:

2207
02:08:50.830 --> 02:08:52.600
Camest thou from where they made the stand?

2208
02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:54.930
I did.

2209
02:08:54.930 --> 02:08:57.700
Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.

2210
02:08:57.700 --> 02:08:59.370
I did.

2211
02:08:59.370 --> 02:09:02.800
No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,

2212
02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:07.370
But that the heavens fought: the king himself

2213
02:09:07.370 --> 02:09:10.530
Of his wings destitute, the army broken,

2214
02:09:10.530 --> 02:09:12.900
And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying

2215
02:09:12.900 --> 02:09:16.430
Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,

2216
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:19.030
Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work

2217
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:21.600
More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down

2218
02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:24.830
Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling

2219
02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:28.530
Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd

2220
02:09:28.530 --> 02:09:32.900
With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living

2221
02:09:32.900 --> 02:09:35.200
To die with lengthen'd shame.

2222
02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:36.870
Where was this lane?

2223
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:41.570
Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;

2224
02:09:41.570 --> 02:09:45.000
Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,

2225
02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.800
An honest one, I warrant; who deserved

2226
02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:49.400
So long a breeding as his white beard came to,

2227
02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:53.730
In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,

2228
02:09:53.730 --> 02:09:56.600
He, with two striplings-lads more like to run

2229
02:09:56.600 --> 02:09:58.970
The country base than to commit such slaughter

2230
02:09:58.970 --> 02:10:01.930
With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer

2231
02:10:01.930 --> 02:10:05.570
Than those for preservation cased, or shame--

2232
02:10:05.570 --> 02:10:09.500
Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,

2233
02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:12.870
'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:

2234
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:16.770
To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;

2235
02:10:16.770 --> 02:10:18.870
Or we are Romans and will give you that

2236
02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:22.130
Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,

2237
02:10:22.130 --> 02:10:25.100
But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'

2238
02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:26.730
These three,

2239
02:10:26.730 --> 02:10:29.400
Three thousand confident, in act as many--

2240
02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:31.330
For three performers are the file when all

2241
02:10:31.330 --> 02:10:35.900
The rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand, stand,'

2242
02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:37.600
Accommodated by the place, more charming

2243
02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:39.430
With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd

2244
02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:42.970
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,

2245
02:10:42.970 --> 02:10:45.700
Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,

2246
02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:46.470
turn'd coward

2247
02:10:46.470 --> 02:10:49.170
But by example--O, a sin in war,

2248
02:10:49.170 --> 02:10:51.470
Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look

2249
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:54.830
The way that they did, and to grin like lions

2250
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:58.170
Upon the pikes o' the hunters.

2251
02:10:58.170 --> 02:10:59.900
This was strange chance

2252
02:11:00.670 --> 02:11:04.300
A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.

2253
02:11:05.370 --> 02:11:09.200
Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made

2254
02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:11.530
Rather to wonder at the things you hear

2255
02:11:11.530 --> 02:11:15.170
Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,

2256
02:11:15.170 --> 02:11:20.070
And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:

2257
02:11:20.070 --> 02:11:25.470
'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,

2258
02:11:25.470 --> 02:11:29.100
Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'

2259
02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:30.500
Nay, be not angry, sir.

2260
02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:32.670
'Lack, to what end?

2261
02:11:32.670 --> 02:11:36.230
Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;

2262
02:11:36.230 --> 02:11:38.000
For if he'll do as he is made to do,

2263
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.870
I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.

2264
02:11:42.830 --> 02:11:44.530
You have put me into rhyme.

2265
02:11:44.530 --> 02:11:45.830
Farewell; you're angry.

2266
02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:51.100
Still going?

2267
02:11:52.370 --> 02:11:58.330
This is a lord! O noble misery,

2268
02:11:58.330 --> 02:12:02.230
To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!

2269
02:12:04.330 --> 02:12:08.130
To-day how many would have given their honours

2270
02:12:08.130 --> 02:12:12.800
To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,

2271
02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:20.200
And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,

2272
02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:25.000
Could not find death where I did hear him groan,

2273
02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:28.570
Nor feel him where he struck:

2274
02:12:28.570 --> 02:12:31.530
being an ugly monster,

2275
02:12:31.530 --> 02:12:38.470
'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,

2276
02:12:38.470 --> 02:12:42.400
Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we

2277
02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:45.130
That draw his knives i' the war.

2278
02:12:46.570 --> 02:12:51.770
Well, I will find him

2279
02:12:51.770 --> 02:12:53.930
For being now a favourer to the Briton,

2280
02:12:53.930 --> 02:12:56.400
No more a Briton, I have resumed again

2281
02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:59.770
The part I came in: fight I will no more,

2282
02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:03.630
But yield me to the veriest hind that shall

2283
02:13:03.630 --> 02:13:06.770
Once touch my shoulder.

2284
02:13:07.170 --> 02:13:08.170
Great the slaughter is

2285
02:13:08.170 --> 02:13:10.970
Here made by the Roman; great the answer be

2286
02:13:10.970 --> 02:13:18.500
Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;

2287
02:13:19.230 --> 02:13:22.630
On either side I come to spend my breath;

2288
02:13:23.230 --> 02:13:26.100
Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,

2289
02:13:27.170 --> 02:13:32.830
But end it by some means for Imogen.

2290
02:13:32.830 --> 02:13:34.900
Stand! who's there?

2291
02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:36.100
A Roman,

2292
02:13:36.100 --> 02:13:38.800
Lay hands on him; a dog!

2293
02:13:47.530 --> 02:13:49.830
You shall not now be stol'n,

2294
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:53.770
you have locks upon you;

2295
02:13:55.330 --> 02:14:01.970
Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,

2296
02:14:01.970 --> 02:14:08.570
I think, to liberty: yet am I better

2297
02:14:08.570 --> 02:14:11.030
Than one that's sick o' the gout;

2298
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.900
since he had rather

2299
02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:14.670
Groan so in perpetuity than be cured

2300
02:14:14.670 --> 02:14:17.970
By the sure physician, death, who is the key

2301
02:14:17.970 --> 02:14:19.930
To unbar these locks.

2302
02:14:21.970 --> 02:14:25.170
My conscience, thou art fetter'd

2303
02:14:25.170 --> 02:14:28.030
More than my shanks and wrists:

2304
02:14:29.130 --> 02:14:31.670
you good gods, give me

2305
02:14:31.670 --> 02:14:34.900
The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,

2306
02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:42.900
Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?

2307
02:14:44.530 --> 02:14:48.530
So children temporal fathers do appease;

2308
02:14:48.530 --> 02:14:54.500
Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?

2309
02:14:54.500 --> 02:14:57.130
I cannot do it better than in gyves,

2310
02:14:57.130 --> 02:15:02.030
Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,

2311
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:05.070
If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take

2312
02:15:05.070 --> 02:15:08.430
No stricter render of me than my all.

2313
02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:12.070
I know you are more clement than vile men,

2314
02:15:12.070 --> 02:15:14.070
Who of their broken debtors take a third,

2315
02:15:14.070 --> 02:15:16.670
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again

2316
02:15:16.670 --> 02:15:20.530
On their abatement: that's not my desire:

2317
02:15:22.070 --> 02:15:29.770
For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though

2318
02:15:29.770 --> 02:15:36.030
'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it:

2319
02:15:36.030 --> 02:15:39.700
'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;

2320
02:15:39.700 --> 02:15:42.370
Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:

2321
02:15:42.370 --> 02:15:46.600
You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,

2322
02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:50.430
If you will take this audit, take this life,

2323
02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:54.430
And cancel these cold bonds.

2324
02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:00.070
O Imogen!

2325
02:16:02.570 --> 02:16:08.030
I'll speak to thee in silence.

2326
02:16:14.930 --> 02:16:18.000
No more, thou thunder-master, show

2327
02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:21.600
Thy spite on mortal flies:

2328
02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:25.170
With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,

2329
02:16:25.170 --> 02:16:27.000
That thy adulteries

2330
02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:30.470
Rates and revenges.

2331
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:36.330
Hath my poor boy done aught but well,

2332
02:16:36.330 --> 02:16:39.330
Whose face I never saw?

2333
02:16:39.330 --> 02:16:42.870
I died whilst in the womb he stay'd

2334
02:16:42.870 --> 02:16:45.200
Attending nature's law:

2335
02:16:45.530 --> 02:16:47.970
Lucina lent not me her aid,

2336
02:16:47.970 --> 02:16:50.500
But took me in my throes;

2337
02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:53.230
That from me was Posthumus ript,

2338
02:16:53.230 --> 02:16:55.970
Came crying 'mongst his foes,

2339
02:16:56.830 --> 02:16:58.270
A thing of pity!

2340
02:17:00.830 --> 02:17:03.830
With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,

2341
02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:05.230
To be exiled, and thrown

2342
02:17:05.230 --> 02:17:07.170
From Leonati seat, and cast

2343
02:17:07.170 --> 02:17:09.070
From her his dearest one,

2344
02:17:09.070 --> 02:17:10.930
Sweet Imogen?

2345
02:17:10.930 --> 02:17:13.700
Why did you suffer Iachimo,

2346
02:17:13.700 --> 02:17:15.870
Slight thing of Italy,

2347
02:17:15.870 --> 02:17:18.170
To taint his nobler heart and brain

2348
02:17:18.170 --> 02:17:20.130
With needless jealosy;

2349
02:17:20.130 --> 02:17:22.500
And to become the geck and scorn

2350
02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:24.530
O' th' other's villany?

2351
02:17:24.530 --> 02:17:27.730
Since, Jupiter, our son is good,

2352
02:17:27.730 --> 02:17:29.600
Take off his miseries.

2353
02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:35.000
Peep through thy marble mansion; help;

2354
02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.400
Or we poor ghosts will cry

2355
02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:39.870
To the shining synod of the rest

2356
02:17:39.870 --> 02:17:42.600
Against thy deity.

2357
02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:45.200
Help, Jupiter; or we appeal,

2358
02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:48.230
And from thy justice fly.

2359
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:51.800
No more, you petty spirits of region low,

2360
02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:58.870
Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts

2361
02:17:58.870 --> 02:18:02.500
Accuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,

2362
02:18:02.500 --> 02:18:09.000
Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?

2363
02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.870
Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest

2364
02:18:13.870 --> 02:18:17.470
Upon your never-withering banks of flowers:

2365
02:18:17.470 --> 02:18:19.570
Be not with mortal accidents opprest;

2366
02:18:19.570 --> 02:18:24.000
No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.

2367
02:18:24.830 --> 02:18:30.900
Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,

2368
02:18:30.900 --> 02:18:35.570
The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;

2369
02:18:35.570 --> 02:18:39.200
Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:

2370
02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:43.700
His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.

2371
02:18:44.470 --> 02:18:48.300
Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in

2372
02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:54.400
Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.

2373
02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:57.700
He shall be lord of lady Imogen,

2374
02:18:57.700 --> 02:19:01.470
And happier much by his affliction made.

2375
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:08.570
This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein

2376
02:19:08.570 --> 02:19:11.870
Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine:

2377
02:19:12.730 --> 02:19:16.970
and so, away: no further with your din

2378
02:19:16.970 --> 02:19:21.700
Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.

2379
02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:30.070
Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot

2380
02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:34.170
A father to me; and thou hast created

2381
02:19:34.170 --> 02:19:37.000
A mother and two brothers:

2382
02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:45.270
but, O scorn!

2383
02:19:46.570 --> 02:19:51.970
Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:

2384
02:19:53.970 --> 02:20:00.430
And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend

2385
02:20:00.430 --> 02:20:04.400
On greatness' favour dream as I have done,

2386
02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:07.600
Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:

2387
02:20:07.600 --> 02:20:10.200
Many dream not to find, neither deserve,

2388
02:20:10.200 --> 02:20:14.470
And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,

2389
02:20:14.470 --> 02:20:19.030
That have this golden chance and know not why.

2390
02:20:22.500 --> 02:20:34.900
What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!

2391
02:20:36.470 --> 02:20:39.700
Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment

2392
02:20:39.700 --> 02:20:43.900
Nobler than that it covers: let thy effects

2393
02:20:43.900 --> 02:20:48.770
So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,

2394
02:20:48.770 --> 02:20:50.730
As good as promise.

2395
02:20:54.370 --> 02:21:01.500
'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,

2396
02:21:01.500 --> 02:21:06.200
without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of

2397
02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:11.970
tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be

2398
02:21:11.970 --> 02:21:15.530
lopped branches, which, being dead many years,

2399
02:21:15.530 --> 02:21:20.200
shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock

2400
02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:28.170
and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,

2401
02:21:28.170 --> 02:21:34.300
Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.'

2402
02:21:36.270 --> 02:21:40.730
'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen

2403
02:21:40.730 --> 02:21:45.170
Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing;

2404
02:21:45.170 --> 02:21:48.870
Or senseless speaking or a speaking such

2405
02:21:48.870 --> 02:21:54.800
As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,

2406
02:21:57.800 --> 02:22:00.870
The action of my life is like it,

2407
02:22:01.900 --> 02:22:06.130
which I'll keep, if but for sympathy.

2408
02:22:07.630 --> 02:22:09.800
Come, sir, are you ready for death?

2409
02:22:09.800 --> 02:22:12.600
Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.

2410
02:22:12.600 --> 02:22:14.130
Hanging is the word, sir:

2411
02:22:14.130 --> 02:22:16.770
if you be ready for that, you are well cooked.

2412
02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:21.570
So, if I prove a good repast to the spectators,

2413
02:22:21.570 --> 02:22:23.800
the dish pays the shot.

2414
02:22:23.800 --> 02:22:26.900
A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is,

2415
02:22:26.900 --> 02:22:29.400
you shall be called to no more payments,

2416
02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:32.230
fear no more tavern-bills; which are often the sadness

2417
02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:35.470
of parting, as the procuring of mirth:

2418
02:22:35.470 --> 02:22:38.900
of this contradiction you shall now be quit.

2419
02:22:38.900 --> 02:22:41.000
O, the charity of a penny cord!

2420
02:22:42.130 --> 02:22:44.730
Knock off his manacles;

2421
02:22:44.730 --> 02:22:47.100
bring your prisoner to the king.

2422
02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:52.570
Thou bring'st good news; I am called to be made free.

2423
02:22:52.570 --> 02:22:54.070
I'll be hang'd then.

2424
02:22:54.430 --> 02:22:58.200
Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made

2425
02:22:58.200 --> 02:23:02.530
Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart

2426
02:23:02.530 --> 02:23:05.870
That the poor soldier that so richly fought,

2427
02:23:05.870 --> 02:23:11.430
Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast

2428
02:23:11.430 --> 02:23:15.930
Stepp'd before larges of proof, cannot be found:

2429
02:23:15.930 --> 02:23:17.670
He shall be happy that can find him, if

2430
02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:20.170
Our grace can make him so.

2431
02:23:20.170 --> 02:23:20.970
I never saw

2432
02:23:20.970 --> 02:23:24.070
Such noble fury in so poor a thing;

2433
02:23:24.070 --> 02:23:26.470
Such precious deeds in one that promises nought

2434
02:23:26.470 --> 02:23:28.770
But beggary and poor looks.

2435
02:23:28.770 --> 02:23:30.530
No tidings of him?

2436
02:23:30.530 --> 02:23:32.770
He hath been search'd among the dead and living,

2437
02:23:32.770 --> 02:23:34.800
But no trace of him.

2438
02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:36.800
To my grief, I am

2439
02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:40.100
The heir of his reward;

2440
02:23:40.100 --> 02:23:41.430
which I will add

2441
02:23:41.430 --> 02:23:45.230
To you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,

2442
02:23:45.230 --> 02:23:50.130
By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time

2443
02:23:50.130 --> 02:23:53.830
To ask of whence you are. Report it.

2444
02:23:53.830 --> 02:23:54.700
Sir,

2445
02:23:54.700 --> 02:23:57.230
In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:

2446
02:23:57.230 --> 02:24:00.370
Further to boast were neither true nor modest,

2447
02:24:00.370 --> 02:24:03.700
Unless I add, we are honest.

2448
02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:05.330
Bow your knees.

2449
02:24:10.730 --> 02:24:15.900
Arise my knights o' the battle: I create you

2450
02:24:15.900 --> 02:24:19.330
Companions to our person and will fit you

2451
02:24:19.330 --> 02:24:23.870
With dignities becoming your estates.

2452
02:24:27.130 --> 02:24:32.470
There's business in these faces. Why so sadly

2453
02:24:32.470 --> 02:24:36.030
Greet you our victory? you look like Romans,

2454
02:24:36.030 --> 02:24:37.400
And not o' the court of Britain.

2455
02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:38.700
Hail, great king!

2456
02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:40.800
To sour your happiness, I must report

2457
02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:42.900
The queen is dead.

2458
02:24:46.770 --> 02:24:50.170
Who worse than a physician

2459
02:24:50.170 --> 02:24:58.030
Would this report become? But I consider,

2460
02:24:58.030 --> 02:25:02.000
By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death

2461
02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:09.870
Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?

2462
02:25:09.870 --> 02:25:13.030
With horror, madly dying, like her life,

2463
02:25:13.030 --> 02:25:15.400
Which, being cruel to the world, concluded

2464
02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:18.600
Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd

2465
02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:21.230
I will report, so please you: these her women

2466
02:25:21.230 --> 02:25:23.770
Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks

2467
02:25:23.770 --> 02:25:26.300
Were present when she finish'd.

2468
02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:28.100
Prithee, say.

2469
02:25:28.100 --> 02:25:31.130
First, she confess'd she never loved you, only

2470
02:25:31.130 --> 02:25:34.470
Affected greatness got by you, not you:

2471
02:25:34.470 --> 02:25:37.370
Married your royalty, was wife to your place;

2472
02:25:37.370 --> 02:25:39.330
Abhorr'd your person.

2473
02:25:39.330 --> 02:25:42.470
She alone knew this;

2474
02:25:44.500 --> 02:25:46.170
And, but she spoke it dying, I would not

2475
02:25:46.170 --> 02:25:51.900
Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.

2476
02:25:51.900 --> 02:25:54.500
Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love

2477
02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:56.930
With such integrity, she did confess

2478
02:25:56.930 --> 02:25:59.700
Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,

2479
02:25:59.700 --> 02:26:01.200
But that her flight prevented it, she had

2480
02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:04.130
Ta'en off by poison.

2481
02:26:04.130 --> 02:26:07.130
O most delicate fiend!

2482
02:26:08.270 --> 02:26:16.000
Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?

2483
02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:19.430
More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had

2484
02:26:19.430 --> 02:26:22.730
For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,

2485
02:26:22.730 --> 02:26:25.770
Should by the minute feed on life and lingering

2486
02:26:25.770 --> 02:26:29.370
By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,

2487
02:26:29.370 --> 02:26:33.700
By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to

2488
02:26:33.700 --> 02:26:36.700
O'ercome you with her show, and in time,

2489
02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:39.400
When she had fitted you with her craft, to work

2490
02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:42.130
Her son into the adoption of the crown:

2491
02:26:42.130 --> 02:26:44.870
Heard you all this, her women?

2492
02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:48.230
We did, so please your highness.

2493
02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:55.430
Mine eyes

2494
02:26:55.430 --> 02:26:58.670
Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;

2495
02:27:01.630 --> 02:27:11.170
Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,

2496
02:27:11.170 --> 02:27:14.630
That thought her like her seeming;

2497
02:27:16.470 --> 02:27:17.530
it had been vicious

2498
02:27:17.530 --> 02:27:25.770
To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!

2499
02:27:25.770 --> 02:27:29.330
That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,

2500
02:27:30.730 --> 02:27:39.100
And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!

2501
02:27:51.070 --> 02:27:55.370
Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute

2502
02:27:55.370 --> 02:27:58.970
Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day

2503
02:27:58.970 --> 02:28:03.900
Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,

2504
02:28:03.900 --> 02:28:05.930
We should not, when the blood was cool,

2505
02:28:05.930 --> 02:28:07.000
have threaten'd

2506
02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:10.900
Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods

2507
02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:13.270
Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives

2508
02:28:13.270 --> 02:28:16.600
May be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficeth

2509
02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:19.330
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:

2510
02:28:19.330 --> 02:28:23.530
Augustus lives to think on't: and so much

2511
02:28:23.530 --> 02:28:27.530
For my peculiar care.

2512
02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:29.530
This one thing only

2513
02:28:29.530 --> 02:28:32.870
I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,

2514
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:35.870
Let him be ransom'd:

2515
02:28:36.730 --> 02:28:42.030
never master had a page so kind, so duteous, diligent,

2516
02:28:42.030 --> 02:28:45.500
So tender over his occasions, true,

2517
02:28:45.500 --> 02:28:52.370
So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join

2518
02:28:52.370 --> 02:28:54.970
With my request, which I make bold your highness

2519
02:28:54.970 --> 02:28:58.400
Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,

2520
02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:03.000
Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,

2521
02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.370
And spare no blood beside.

2522
02:29:05.370 --> 02:29:07.400
I have surely seen him:

2523
02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:09.470
His favour is familiar to me.

2524
02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:18.930
Boy, Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,

2525
02:29:18.930 --> 02:29:23.630
And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,

2526
02:29:23.630 --> 02:29:29.600
To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:

2527
02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:32.700
And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,

2528
02:29:32.700 --> 02:29:35.970
Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;

2529
02:29:35.970 --> 02:29:38.000
Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,

2530
02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:38.870
The noblest ta'en.

2531
02:29:38.870 --> 02:29:40.400
I humbly thank your highness.

2532
02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:42.170
I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;

2533
02:29:42.170 --> 02:29:43.230
And yet I know thou wilt.

2534
02:29:43.230 --> 02:29:45.000
No, no: alack,

2535
02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.770
There's other work in hand: I see a thing

2536
02:29:46.770 --> 02:29:49.270
Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,

2537
02:29:49.270 --> 02:29:50.830
Must shuffle for itself.

2538
02:29:50.830 --> 02:29:52.170
The boy disdains me,

2539
02:29:52.170 --> 02:29:55.600
He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys

2540
02:29:55.600 --> 02:29:58.400
That place them on the truth of girls and boys.

2541
02:29:59.300 --> 02:30:03.500
What wouldst thou, boy? Speak.

2542
02:30:03.500 --> 02:30:05.070
Know'st him thou look'st on?

2543
02:30:05.070 --> 02:30:06.930
Is he thy kin? thy friend?

2544
02:30:06.930 --> 02:30:09.800
He is a Roman; no more kin to me

2545
02:30:09.800 --> 02:30:12.800
Than I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,

2546
02:30:12.800 --> 02:30:14.430
Am something nearer.

2547
02:30:14.430 --> 02:30:16.300
Wherefore eyest him so?

2548
02:30:16.300 --> 02:30:17.700
I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please

2549
02:30:17.700 --> 02:30:19.300
To give me hearing.

2550
02:30:19.300 --> 02:30:20.330
Ay, with all my heart,

2551
02:30:20.330 --> 02:30:24.270
And lend my best attention. What's thy name?

2552
02:30:24.270 --> 02:30:25.770
Fidele, sir.

2553
02:30:25.770 --> 02:30:27.970
Thou'rt my good youth, my page;

2554
02:30:27.970 --> 02:30:32.330
I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.

2555
02:30:33.230 --> 02:30:35.770
Is not this boy revived from death?

2556
02:30:35.770 --> 02:30:36.630
One sand another

2557
02:30:36.630 --> 02:30:38.300
Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad

2558
02:30:38.300 --> 02:30:41.330
Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?

2559
02:30:41.330 --> 02:30:42.570
The same dead thing alive.

2560
02:30:42.570 --> 02:30:45.970
Peace, peace! see further; he eyes us not; forbear;

2561
02:30:45.970 --> 02:30:48.500
It is my mistress:

2562
02:30:48.500 --> 02:30:51.230
Since she is living, let the time run on

2563
02:30:51.230 --> 02:30:52.870
To good or bad.

2564
02:30:53.070 --> 02:30:55.070
Stand thou by our side;

2565
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:57.430
Make thy demand aloud.

2566
02:30:59.930 --> 02:31:03.100
Sir, step you forth;

2567
02:31:05.800 --> 02:31:08.730
Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;

2568
02:31:08.730 --> 02:31:10.770
Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,

2569
02:31:10.770 --> 02:31:14.930
Which is our honour, bitter torture shall

2570
02:31:14.930 --> 02:31:19.000
Winnow the truth from falsehood.

2571
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:21.730
On, speak to him.

2572
02:31:21.730 --> 02:31:23.770
My boon is, that this gentleman may render

2573
02:31:23.770 --> 02:31:25.830
Of whom he had this ring.

2574
02:31:25.830 --> 02:31:27.030
What's that to him?

2575
02:31:27.030 --> 02:31:29.530
That diamond upon your finger, say

2576
02:31:29.530 --> 02:31:31.400
How came it yours?

2577
02:31:33.800 --> 02:31:35.400
Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that

2578
02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:37.300
Which, to be spoke, would torture thee.

2579
02:31:37.300 --> 02:31:38.970
How! me?

2580
02:31:40.830 --> 02:31:42.370
I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that

2581
02:31:42.370 --> 02:31:46.100
Which torments me to conceal.

2582
02:31:46.100 --> 02:31:51.800
By villany I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;

2583
02:31:51.800 --> 02:31:53.930
Whom thou didst banish;

2584
02:31:54.800 --> 02:31:57.330
and--which more may grieve thee,

2585
02:31:57.330 --> 02:32:01.500
As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived

2586
02:32:01.500 --> 02:32:03.770
'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?

2587
02:32:03.770 --> 02:32:05.900
All that belongs to this.

2588
02:32:05.900 --> 02:32:08.730
That paragon, thy daughter,--

2589
02:32:08.730 --> 02:32:11.300
For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits

2590
02:32:11.300 --> 02:32:20.230
Quail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.

2591
02:32:20.230 --> 02:32:23.070
My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:

2592
02:32:23.070 --> 02:32:24.730
I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will

2593
02:32:24.730 --> 02:32:29.300
Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.

2594
02:32:31.200 --> 02:32:33.530
Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock

2595
02:32:33.530 --> 02:32:37.430
That struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursed

2596
02:32:37.430 --> 02:32:42.770
The mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, would

2597
02:32:42.770 --> 02:32:44.470
Our viands had been poison'd, or at least

2598
02:32:44.470 --> 02:32:47.230
Those which I heaved to head!

2599
02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:49.430
--the good Posthumus--

2600
02:32:51.230 --> 02:32:55.230
What should I say? he was too good to be

2601
02:32:55.230 --> 02:32:59.200
Where ill men were; and was the best of all

2602
02:32:59.200 --> 02:33:04.870
Amongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,

2603
02:33:04.870 --> 02:33:06.570
Hearing us praise our loves of Italy

2604
02:33:06.570 --> 02:33:08.330
For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast

2605
02:33:08.330 --> 02:33:10.530
Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming

2606
02:33:10.530 --> 02:33:12.800
The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.

2607
02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:16.170
Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,

2608
02:33:16.170 --> 02:33:17.700
A shop of all the qualities that man

2609
02:33:17.700 --> 02:33:20.700
Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,

2610
02:33:20.700 --> 02:33:22.130
Fairness which strikes the eye--

2611
02:33:22.130 --> 02:33:23.370
I stand on fire:

2612
02:33:23.370 --> 02:33:24.830
Come to the matter.

2613
02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:26.370
All too soon I shall,

2614
02:33:27.630 --> 02:33:31.130
Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly.

2615
02:33:31.900 --> 02:33:34.030
This Posthumus,

2616
02:33:34.030 --> 02:33:36.600
Most like a noble lord in love and one

2617
02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:38.900
That had a royal lover, took his hint;

2618
02:33:38.900 --> 02:33:41.400
And, not dispraising whom we praised,--therein

2619
02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:44.170
He was as calm as virtue--he began

2620
02:33:44.170 --> 02:33:45.900
His mistress' picture; which by his tongue

2621
02:33:45.900 --> 02:33:46.830
being made,

2622
02:33:46.830 --> 02:33:49.930
And then a mind put in't, either our brags

2623
02:33:49.930 --> 02:33:51.230
Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls,

2624
02:33:51.230 --> 02:33:53.870
or his description Proved us unspeaking sots.

2625
02:33:53.870 --> 02:33:56.070
Nay, nay, to the purpose.

2626
02:33:56.070 --> 02:34:02.270
Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.

2627
02:34:03.430 --> 02:34:07.030
He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,

2628
02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:10.670
And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,

2629
02:34:10.670 --> 02:34:12.670
Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him

2630
02:34:12.670 --> 02:34:16.530
Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore

2631
02:34:16.530 --> 02:34:18.270
Upon his honour'd finger, to attain

2632
02:34:18.270 --> 02:34:21.570
In suit the place of's bed and win this ring

2633
02:34:21.570 --> 02:34:24.470
By hers and mine adultery.

2634
02:34:24.770 --> 02:34:26.830
He, true knight,

2635
02:34:26.830 --> 02:34:28.330
No lesser of her honour confident

2636
02:34:28.330 --> 02:34:31.030
Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;

2637
02:34:31.030 --> 02:34:32.630
And would so, had it been a carbuncle

2638
02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:34.270
Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it

2639
02:34:34.270 --> 02:34:37.070
Been all the worth of's car.

2640
02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:39.570
Away to Britain

2641
02:34:39.570 --> 02:34:41.930
Post I in this design: well may you, sir,

2642
02:34:41.930 --> 02:34:43.870
Remember me at court; where I was taught

2643
02:34:43.870 --> 02:34:46.300
Of your chaste daughter the wide difference

2644
02:34:46.300 --> 02:34:49.870
'Twixt amorous and villanous.

2645
02:34:51.130 --> 02:34:52.070
Being thus quench'd

2646
02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:56.700
Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain

2647
02:34:56.700 --> 02:35:00.170
'Gan in your duller Britain operate

2648
02:35:00.170 --> 02:35:04.830
Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:

2649
02:35:04.830 --> 02:35:08.900
And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,

2650
02:35:08.900 --> 02:35:10.830
That I return'd with simular proof enough

2651
02:35:10.830 --> 02:35:14.300
To make the noble Leonatus mad,

2652
02:35:14.970 --> 02:35:17.100
By wounding his belief in her renown

2653
02:35:17.100 --> 02:35:21.730
With tokens thus, and thus;

2654
02:35:23.630 --> 02:35:25.330
averting notes of chamber-hanging,

2655
02:35:25.330 --> 02:35:27.470
pictures, this her bracelet,--

2656
02:35:28.500 --> 02:35:34.000
O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks

2657
02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:35.700
Of secret on her person, that he could not

2658
02:35:35.700 --> 02:35:38.630
But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,

2659
02:35:40.130 --> 02:35:43.400
I having ta'en the forfeit.

2660
02:35:44.170 --> 02:35:49.500
Whereupon-- Methinks, I see him now--

2661
02:35:49.500 --> 02:35:53.600
Ay, so thou dost,

2662
02:35:53.600 --> 02:36:03.530
Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,

2663
02:36:03.530 --> 02:36:07.770
Egregious murderer, thief, any thing

2664
02:36:07.770 --> 02:36:11.130
That's due to all the villains past, in being,

2665
02:36:11.130 --> 02:36:17.670
To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,

2666
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:22.970
Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send out

2667
02:36:22.970 --> 02:36:25.830
For torturers ingenious: it is I

2668
02:36:25.830 --> 02:36:28.730
That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend

2669
02:36:28.730 --> 02:36:34.800
By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,

2670
02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:37.770
That kill'd thy daughter:

2671
02:36:37.770 --> 02:36:39.100
--villain-like, I lie--

2672
02:36:39.100 --> 02:36:41.130
That caused a lesser villain than myself,

2673
02:36:41.130 --> 02:36:44.930
A sacrilegious thief, to do't:

2674
02:36:44.930 --> 02:36:51.630
the temple Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.

2675
02:36:51.630 --> 02:36:57.100
Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me,

2676
02:36:57.100 --> 02:37:01.270
set the dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain

2677
02:37:01.270 --> 02:37:03.800
Be call'd Posthumus Leonitus;

2678
02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:08.070
and be villany less than 'twas!

2679
02:37:08.070 --> 02:37:10.930
O Imogen!

2680
02:37:10.930 --> 02:37:19.370
My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,

2681
02:37:19.370 --> 02:37:23.600
Imogen, Imogen!

2682
02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:30.930
Peace, my lord; hear, hear--

2683
02:37:31.570 --> 02:37:36.370
Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,

2684
02:37:36.370 --> 02:37:37.370
There lie thy part.

2685
02:37:37.370 --> 02:37:39.130
O, gentlemen, help!

2686
02:37:39.130 --> 02:37:42.600
Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!

2687
02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:45.800
You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!

2688
02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:47.130
Mine honour'd lady!

2689
02:37:47.130 --> 02:37:48.770
Does the world go round?

2690
02:37:48.770 --> 02:37:51.100
How come these staggers on me?

2691
02:37:51.100 --> 02:37:52.600
Wake, my mistress!

2692
02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:55.630
If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me

2693
02:37:55.630 --> 02:37:58.070
To death with mortal joy.

2694
02:37:58.070 --> 02:38:00.730
How fares thy mistress?

2695
02:38:00.730 --> 02:38:03.300
O, get thee from my sight;

2696
02:38:03.300 --> 02:38:06.470
Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!

2697
02:38:06.470 --> 02:38:08.200
Breathe not where princes are.

2698
02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:09.270
The tune of Imogen!

2699
02:38:09.270 --> 02:38:10.400
Lady,

2700
02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:12.330
The gods throw stones of sulphur on me,

2701
02:38:12.330 --> 02:38:13.900
if that box I gave you was not thought by me

2702
02:38:13.900 --> 02:38:16.730
A precious thing: I had it from the queen.

2703
02:38:16.730 --> 02:38:18.230
It poison'd me.

2704
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:19.470
O gods!

2705
02:38:19.470 --> 02:38:21.230
I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.

2706
02:38:21.230 --> 02:38:23.770
Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio

2707
02:38:23.770 --> 02:38:26.130
Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection

2708
02:38:26.130 --> 02:38:28.600
Which I gave him for cordial, she is served

2709
02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:30.970
As I would serve a rat.'

2710
02:38:30.970 --> 02:38:32.330
Have you ta'en of it?

2711
02:38:32.330 --> 02:38:35.330
Most like I did, for I was dead.

2712
02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.300
My boys, There was our error.

2713
02:38:38.300 --> 02:38:40.830
This is, sure, Fidele.

2714
02:38:40.830 --> 02:38:44.000
Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?

2715
02:38:44.630 --> 02:38:47.470
Think that you are upon a rock;

2716
02:38:47.470 --> 02:38:49.730
and now throw me again.

2717
02:38:51.130 --> 02:38:54.170
Hang there like a fruit, my soul,

2718
02:38:54.170 --> 02:38:56.430
Till the tree die!

2719
02:38:57.370 --> 02:39:00.800
How now, my flesh, my child!

2720
02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:03.200
What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?

2721
02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:05.400
Wilt thou not speak to me?

2722
02:39:06.270 --> 02:39:07.570
Your blessing, sir.

2723
02:39:11.070 --> 02:39:12.770
My tears that fall

2724
02:39:12.770 --> 02:39:15.670
Prove holy water on thee!

2725
02:39:16.930 --> 02:39:22.170
Imogen, Thy mother's dead.

2726
02:39:22.170 --> 02:39:24.030
I am sorry for't, my lord.

2727
02:39:24.030 --> 02:39:26.500
O, she was nought; and long of her it was

2728
02:39:26.500 --> 02:39:30.330
That we meet here so strangely: but her son

2729
02:39:30.330 --> 02:39:33.500
Is gone, we know not how nor where.

2730
02:39:33.500 --> 02:39:34.930
My lord,

2731
02:39:34.930 --> 02:39:39.130
Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,

2732
02:39:39.130 --> 02:39:40.700
Upon my lady's missing, came to me

2733
02:39:40.700 --> 02:39:44.070
With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,

2734
02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:45.730
If I discover'd not which way she was gone,

2735
02:39:45.730 --> 02:39:47.200
It was my instant death.

2736
02:39:48.030 --> 02:39:51.200
By accident, had a feigned letter of my master's

2737
02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:52.530
Then in my pocket; which directed him

2738
02:39:52.530 --> 02:39:54.830
To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;

2739
02:39:54.830 --> 02:39:58.400
Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,

2740
02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:01.300
Which he enforced from me, away he posts

2741
02:40:01.300 --> 02:40:05.200
With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate

2742
02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:07.770
My lady's honour: what became of him

2743
02:40:07.770 --> 02:40:09.070
I further know not.

2744
02:40:09.070 --> 02:40:11.100
Let me end the story:

2745
02:40:11.100 --> 02:40:12.670
I slew him there.

2746
02:40:12.670 --> 02:40:15.530
Marry, the gods forfend!

2747
02:40:15.530 --> 02:40:18.130
I would not thy good deeds should from my lips

2748
02:40:18.130 --> 02:40:21.300
Pluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,

2749
02:40:21.300 --> 02:40:22.300
Deny't again.

2750
02:40:22.300 --> 02:40:23.900
I have spoke it, and I did it.

2751
02:40:23.900 --> 02:40:24.870
He was a prince.

2752
02:40:24.870 --> 02:40:28.270
A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me

2753
02:40:28.270 --> 02:40:32.030
Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me

2754
02:40:32.030 --> 02:40:34.300
With language that would make me spurn the sea,

2755
02:40:34.300 --> 02:40:37.770
If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;

2756
02:40:37.770 --> 02:40:39.670
And am right glad he is not standing here

2757
02:40:39.670 --> 02:40:41.270
To tell this tale of mine.

2758
02:40:41.270 --> 02:40:42.200
I am sorry for thee:

2759
02:40:42.200 --> 02:40:44.200
By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd,

2760
02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:45.330
and must endure our law.

2761
02:40:45.330 --> 02:40:46.230
Bind the offender,

2762
02:40:46.230 --> 02:40:47.600
And take him from our presence.

2763
02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:49.400
Stay, sir king:

2764
02:40:49.400 --> 02:40:51.630
This man is better than the man he slew,

2765
02:40:51.630 --> 02:40:53.200
As well descended as thyself; and hath

2766
02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:55.600
More of thee merited than a band of Clotens

2767
02:40:55.600 --> 02:40:57.770
Had ever scar for.

2768
02:40:57.770 --> 02:40:59.330
Let his arms alone;

2769
02:41:00.230 --> 02:41:02.100
They were not born for bondage.

2770
02:41:03.230 --> 02:41:05.300
Why, old soldier,

2771
02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:09.070
Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,

2772
02:41:09.070 --> 02:41:11.300
By tasting of our wrath?

2773
02:41:11.570 --> 02:41:13.830
How of descent as good as we?

2774
02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:15.330
In that he spake too far.

2775
02:41:15.330 --> 02:41:16.900
And thou shalt die for't.

2776
02:41:16.900 --> 02:41:19.730
We will die all three:

2777
02:41:19.730 --> 02:41:21.770
But I will prove that two on's are as good

2778
02:41:21.770 --> 02:41:24.930
As I have given out him.

2779
02:41:25.730 --> 02:41:27.870
My sons, I must,

2780
02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:32.070
For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,

2781
02:41:32.070 --> 02:41:33.770
Though, haply, well for you.

2782
02:41:33.770 --> 02:41:34.630
Your danger's ours.

2783
02:41:34.630 --> 02:41:36.630
And our good his.

2784
02:41:36.630 --> 02:41:38.670
Have at it then, by leave.

2785
02:41:40.730 --> 02:41:43.570
Thou hadst, great king, a subject who

2786
02:41:43.570 --> 02:41:45.600
Was call'd Belarius.

2787
02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:46.830
What of him?

2788
02:41:46.830 --> 02:41:48.470
He is a banish'd traitor.

2789
02:41:48.470 --> 02:41:49.530
He it is that hath

2790
02:41:49.530 --> 02:41:53.970
Assumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;

2791
02:41:53.970 --> 02:41:55.500
I know not how a traitor.

2792
02:41:55.500 --> 02:41:56.770
Take him hence:

2793
02:41:56.770 --> 02:41:59.070
The whole world shall not save him.

2794
02:41:59.070 --> 02:42:01.570
Not too hot:

2795
02:42:01.570 --> 02:42:05.500
First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;

2796
02:42:05.500 --> 02:42:07.970
And let it be confiscate all, so soon

2797
02:42:07.970 --> 02:42:09.870
As I have received it.

2798
02:42:09.870 --> 02:42:12.870
Nursing of my sons!

2799
02:42:13.730 --> 02:42:21.100
I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:

2800
02:42:21.100 --> 02:42:25.230
Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;

2801
02:42:25.230 --> 02:42:31.600
Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,

2802
02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:36.370
These two young gentlemen, that call me father

2803
02:42:36.370 --> 02:42:42.700
And think they are my sons, are none of mine;

2804
02:42:42.700 --> 02:42:47.200
They are the issue of your loins, my liege,

2805
02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:50.770
And blood of your begetting.

2806
02:42:51.330 --> 02:42:53.500
How! my issue!

2807
02:42:53.500 --> 02:42:59.330
So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,

2808
02:42:59.330 --> 02:43:04.330
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:

2809
02:43:04.330 --> 02:43:06.030
These gentle princes--

2810
02:43:06.030 --> 02:43:10.570
For such and so they are--these twenty years

2811
02:43:10.570 --> 02:43:14.230
Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I

2812
02:43:14.230 --> 02:43:18.130
Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as

2813
02:43:18.130 --> 02:43:23.570
Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,

2814
02:43:23.570 --> 02:43:26.900
Whom for the theft I wedded,

2815
02:43:26.900 --> 02:43:28.870
stole these children

2816
02:43:28.870 --> 02:43:33.300
Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,

2817
02:43:33.300 --> 02:43:35.400
Having received the punishment before,

2818
02:43:35.400 --> 02:43:40.870
For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty

2819
02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:46.570
Excited me to treason: their dear loss,

2820
02:43:46.570 --> 02:43:50.570
The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped

2821
02:43:50.570 --> 02:44:00.600
Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,

2822
02:44:00.600 --> 02:44:06.170
Here are your sons again; and I must lose

2823
02:44:06.170 --> 02:44:09.700
Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.

2824
02:44:14.430 --> 02:44:17.000
The benediction of these covering heavens

2825
02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:21.370
Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy

2826
02:44:21.370 --> 02:44:24.770
To inlay heaven with stars.

2827
02:44:26.930 --> 02:44:32.800
Thou weep'st, and speak'st.

2828
02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:35.730
The service that you three have done is more

2829
02:44:35.730 --> 02:44:44.130
Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:

2830
02:44:44.130 --> 02:44:46.530
If these be they, I know not how to wish

2831
02:44:46.530 --> 02:44:48.800
A pair of worthier sons.

2832
02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:51.330
Be pleased awhile.

2833
02:44:53.900 --> 02:44:58.670
This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,

2834
02:44:58.670 --> 02:45:06.830
Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:

2835
02:45:06.830 --> 02:45:13.600
This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,

2836
02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:18.770
Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd

2837
02:45:18.770 --> 02:45:21.970
In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand

2838
02:45:21.970 --> 02:45:26.030
Of his queen mother, which for more probation

2839
02:45:26.030 --> 02:45:28.130
I can with ease produce.

2840
02:45:28.130 --> 02:45:29.170
Guiderius had

2841
02:45:29.170 --> 02:45:36.370
Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;

2842
02:45:36.370 --> 02:45:38.170
It was a mark of wonder.

2843
02:45:38.170 --> 02:45:40.230
This is he;

2844
02:45:40.230 --> 02:45:44.730
Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:

2845
02:45:44.730 --> 02:45:46.970
It was wise nature's end in the donation,

2846
02:45:46.970 --> 02:45:50.470
To be his evidence now.

2847
02:45:50.470 --> 02:45:52.430
O, what, am I

2848
02:45:52.430 --> 02:45:57.300
A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother

2849
02:45:57.300 --> 02:46:02.000
Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,

2850
02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.900
That, after this strange starting from your orbs,

2851
02:46:04.900 --> 02:46:07.200
may reign in them now!

2852
02:46:07.200 --> 02:46:10.800
O Imogen, thou hast lost by this a kingdom.

2853
02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:12.600
No, my lord;

2854
02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:19.870
I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,

2855
02:46:19.870 --> 02:46:23.970
Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter

2856
02:46:23.970 --> 02:46:26.670
But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,

2857
02:46:26.670 --> 02:46:33.030
When I was but your sister; I you brothers,

2858
02:46:33.030 --> 02:46:34.200
When ye were so indeed.

2859
02:46:34.200 --> 02:46:35.470
Did you e'er meet?

2860
02:46:35.470 --> 02:46:36.670
Ay, my good lord.

2861
02:46:36.670 --> 02:46:39.300
And at first meeting loved;

2862
02:46:39.670 --> 02:46:42.130
O rare instinct!

2863
02:46:42.130 --> 02:46:46.530
See, Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,

2864
02:46:46.530 --> 02:46:50.630
And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye

2865
02:46:50.630 --> 02:46:57.000
On him, her brothers, me, her master,

2866
02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.730
hitting each object with a joy:

2867
02:46:59.730 --> 02:47:01.970
Let's quit this ground,

2868
02:47:01.970 --> 02:47:05.830
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.

2869
02:47:05.830 --> 02:47:10.070
Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.

2870
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:11.870
My good master,

2871
02:47:11.870 --> 02:47:13.970
I will yet do you service.

2872
02:47:13.970 --> 02:47:15.770
Happy be you!

2873
02:47:15.770 --> 02:47:19.500
The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,

2874
02:47:19.500 --> 02:47:22.130
He would have well becomed this place, and graced

2875
02:47:22.130 --> 02:47:23.600
The thankings of a king.

2876
02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:25.330
I am, sir,

2877
02:47:25.330 --> 02:47:27.970
The soldier that did company these three

2878
02:47:27.970 --> 02:47:31.700
In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for

2879
02:47:31.700 --> 02:47:35.500
The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,

2880
02:47:35.500 --> 02:47:39.700
Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might

2881
02:47:39.700 --> 02:47:42.200
Have made you finish.

2882
02:47:45.770 --> 02:47:48.670
I am down again:

2883
02:47:48.670 --> 02:47:50.730
But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,

2884
02:47:50.730 --> 02:47:58.600
As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,

2885
02:47:58.600 --> 02:48:09.030
Which I so often owe: but your ring first;

2886
02:48:09.030 --> 02:48:11.270
And here the bracelet of the truest princess

2887
02:48:11.270 --> 02:48:12.530
That ever swore her faith.

2888
02:48:12.530 --> 02:48:15.600
Kneel not to me:

2889
02:48:17.330 --> 02:48:20.030
The power that I have on you is, to spare you;

2890
02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:28.070
The malice towards you to forgive you:

2891
02:48:29.830 --> 02:48:36.400
Live, and deal with others better.

2892
02:48:47.430 --> 02:48:49.000
Nobly doom'd!

2893
02:48:50.070 --> 02:48:53.700
We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;

2894
02:48:53.700 --> 02:48:57.370
Pardon's the word to all.

2895
02:48:58.700 --> 02:48:59.630
You holp us, sir,

2896
02:48:59.630 --> 02:49:01.900
As you did mean indeed to be our brother;

2897
02:49:01.900 --> 02:49:03.730
Joy'd are we that you are.

2898
02:49:03.730 --> 02:49:08.530
Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,

2899
02:49:08.530 --> 02:49:11.530
Call forth your soothsayer:

2900
02:49:13.370 --> 02:49:15.030
as I slept, methought

2901
02:49:15.030 --> 02:49:17.030
Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,

2902
02:49:17.030 --> 02:49:20.100
Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows

2903
02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:24.630
Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found

2904
02:49:24.630 --> 02:49:27.500
This label on my bosom; whose containing

2905
02:49:27.500 --> 02:49:29.570
Is so from sense in hardness, that I can

2906
02:49:29.570 --> 02:49:32.570
Make no collection of it:

2907
02:49:33.570 --> 02:49:36.630
let her show her skill in the construction.

2908
02:49:37.870 --> 02:49:40.600
Read, and declare the meaning.

2909
02:49:43.970 --> 02:49:46.130
'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself

2910
02:49:46.130 --> 02:49:49.300
unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a

2911
02:49:49.300 --> 02:49:54.000
piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar

2912
02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:57.200
shall be lopped branches, which, being dead

2913
02:49:57.200 --> 02:49:59.100
many years, shall after revive,

2914
02:49:59.100 --> 02:50:03.930
be jointed to the old stock, and freshly grow;

2915
02:50:03.930 --> 02:50:08.200
then shall Posthumus end his miseries,

2916
02:50:08.200 --> 02:50:13.000
Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.'

2917
02:50:15.370 --> 02:50:18.500
Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;

2918
02:50:18.500 --> 02:50:20.930
The fit and apt construction of thy name,

2919
02:50:20.930 --> 02:50:25.530
Being Leonatus, doth import so much.

2920
02:50:26.630 --> 02:50:31.800
The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,

2921
02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:34.330
Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'

2922
02:50:34.330 --> 02:50:37.170
We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divine

2923
02:50:37.170 --> 02:50:40.970
Is this most constant wife; who, even now,

2924
02:50:40.970 --> 02:50:42.800
Answering the letter of the oracle,

2925
02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:46.400
Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about

2926
02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:48.870
With this most tender air.

2927
02:50:48.870 --> 02:50:50.670
This hath some seeming.

2928
02:50:50.670 --> 02:50:52.570
The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,

2929
02:50:52.570 --> 02:50:54.800
Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches point

2930
02:50:54.800 --> 02:50:58.570
Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,

2931
02:50:58.570 --> 02:51:01.200
For many years thought dead, are now revived,

2932
02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:03.430
To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue

2933
02:51:03.430 --> 02:51:06.900
Promises Britain peace and plenty.

2934
02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:09.830
Well

2935
02:51:09.830 --> 02:51:13.470
My peace we will begin.

2936
02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.030
And, Caius Lucius,

2937
02:51:16.030 --> 02:51:20.270
Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,

2938
02:51:20.270 --> 02:51:22.570
And to the Roman empire; promising

2939
02:51:22.570 --> 02:51:24.870
To pay our wonted tribute, from the which

2940
02:51:24.870 --> 02:51:28.000
We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;

2941
02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:31.870
Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,

2942
02:51:31.870 --> 02:51:35.330
Have laid most heavy hand.

2943
02:51:35.330 --> 02:51:37.700
The fingers of the powers above do tune

2944
02:51:37.700 --> 02:51:40.800
The harmony of this peace. The vision

2945
02:51:40.800 --> 02:51:43.500
Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke

2946
02:51:43.500 --> 02:51:46.430
Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant

2947
02:51:46.430 --> 02:51:51.930
Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,

2948
02:51:51.930 --> 02:51:56.430
From south to west on wing soaring aloft,

2949
02:51:56.430 --> 02:52:00.930
Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun

2950
02:52:00.930 --> 02:52:07.000
So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,

2951
02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:10.570
The imperial Caesar, should again unite

2952
02:52:10.570 --> 02:52:14.030
His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,

2953
02:52:14.030 --> 02:52:16.430
Which shines here in the west.

2954
02:52:16.430 --> 02:52:18.770
Laud we the gods;

2955
02:52:18.770 --> 02:52:22.630
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils

2956
02:52:22.630 --> 02:52:25.130
From our blest altars.

2957
02:54:35.770 --> 02:54:38.770
