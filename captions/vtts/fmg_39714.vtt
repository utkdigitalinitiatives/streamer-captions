WEBVTT

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.630
WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH
A DIFFERENT KIND OF FUEL.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.130
WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUT OF GAS.
THERE'S JUST NO QUESTION.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.930
BIG COMPANIES, THEY'VE BEEN
REALLY PUSHING SINCE THE 1950s,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.830
TRYING TO MAKE A COMMERCIAL
FUEL-CELL PRODUCT.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.130
WE WOULD MAKE MORE ENERGY THAN
WE COULD EVER DREAM OF USING

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.700
AS A CIVILIZATION.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.960
WHOA!

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.900
CANCER IS NO JOKE,
BUT TREATMENT IS WORSE.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.760
THERE'S GOT TO BE
A BETTER WAY.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.100
CANCER--WHAT DID I
KNOW ABOUT IT?

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.900
COULD WE INJECT A NANOPARTICLE
DRUG INTO A HUMAN?

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.630
IT'S JUST NOT A BUNCH OF NUMBERS
ON A PIECE OF PAPER.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.200
IT'S REALLY PERSONAL.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.630
FIRST IN A HUMAN, FIRST
PATIENT--IS IT GOING TO WORK?

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.330
"SURVIVAL," ON THIS EPISODE
OF "CURIOUS."

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.560
"CURIOUS" IS MADE POSSIBLE
BY TIAA-CREF.

WELCOME TO powerof.org.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.030
WELCOME TO TIAA CREF.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.700
WE'RE A $400 BILLION
FINANCIAL SERVICES .org

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.400
WITH THE HEART
OF A NONPROFIT,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.000
SERVING THOSE
WHO SERVE THE GREATER GOOD.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.460
WE ARE COMMITTED
TO PROVIDING THEM

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.900
HONEST, OBJECTIVE
RETIREMENT ADVICE.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.930
THAT'S powerof.org.
THAT'S TIAA CREF.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.060
Man: WE ARE ALL
SCIENTISTS.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.260
EVERY ONE OF US
IS A SCIENTIST.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.430
WE ARE DOING
THE BIGGEST EXPERIMENT

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.430
EVER.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.160
THE EXPERIMENT IS TAKING
CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.600
TO A PLACE
THEY'VE NEVER BEEN

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.330
IN AT LEAST THE LAST
3/4 OF A MILLION YEARS.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.060
THE DEBATES ARE NOT WHETHER
CO2 IS CONTRIBUTING

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.900
TO GLOBAL WARMING.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.800
THE QUESTIONS ARE HOW MUCH
IS IT GOING TO CONTRIBUTE,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.530
AND WHAT'S IT GOING TO DO?

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.430
THAT'S AN EXPERIMENT
WE MAY NOT WANT TO RUN.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.760
IT'S CLEAR THAT WE HAVE
A LOOMING ENERGY CRISIS.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.230
WE'VE BURNT THROUGH

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.830
HALF THE WORLD'S, YOU KNOW,
STORED ENERGY RESOURCES

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.900
FOR THE LAST
5 BILLION YEARS

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.830
IN, YOU KNOW,
BASICALLY 130.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.700
WE'RE GOING TO
RUN OUT OF GAS.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.230
THERE'S JUST NO QUESTION.
IT'S GOING TO RUN OUT.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.160
WHICH IS GOING TO
GET US FIRST--

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.700
ARE WE GOING TO
RUN OUT OF OIL,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.530
OR ARE WE GOING TO BURN ALL
THAT OIL AND MAKE ALL THAT CO2?

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.600
WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO DO
THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.460
WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH
A DIFFERENT KIND OF FUEL.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.560
WHEN HUMANS EXIST, WE ARE
GLOWING 100-WATT LIGHT BULBS.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.230
A 2,000-CALORIE DIET PER DAY
IS EQUIVALENT TO US

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.730
GLOWING LIKE
A 100-WATT LIGHT BULB.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.400
NOW, IT TAKES 10 TIMES
THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.230
TO BRING THAT FOOD
FROM THE FARM

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.230
AND TO PUT IT INTO A TRUCK
AND PUT IT INTO A REFRIGERATOR

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.400
AND GET IT
INTO YOUR MOUTH.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.160
IF YOU JUST ADD UP
THE ENERGY IT TAKES

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.000
TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE
AND EAT,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.600
THAT'S ALREADY
10 TRILLION WATTS.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.430
AND THEN WE ACTUALLY
HAVE TO DO OTHER THINGS

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.200
LIKE GET TO WORK,
LIKE TURN ON THE LIGHTS.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.460
AS POPULATION GROWS,
WE'RE GOING TO NEED

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.060
BETWEEN 20 AND 25 TRILLION
WATTS OF ENERGY.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.930
SO WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GET
20 TO 25 TRILLION WATTS

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.160
OF CARBON-FREE ENERGY
WITHIN OUR LIFETIMES?

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.560
Woman: WE CAN THINK ABOUT
LOTS OF RENEWABLES,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.900
LIKE TIDAL AND WIND
AND GEOTHERMAL AND SO ON,

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.230
BUT THOSE ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT
ENERGY INPUTS.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.530
Lewis: NUCLEAR COULD BE
A SLICE OF THIS PUZZLE.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.900
BUT EVEN TO BE A SLICE...

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.400
WE WOULD HAVE TO BUILD
10,000 NUCLEAR REACTORS

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.400
OVER THE NEXT 50 YEARS.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.200
Woman: DO WE WANT TO PUT
NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.000
IN COUNTRIES THAT WE'RE ALREADY
SAYING, "DON'T DO THIS"?

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.600
Lewis: YOU COULD GET TO MAYBE
PIECING TOGETHER A LITTLE PUZZLE

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.560
THAT BARELY GETS YOU TO HALF
OF WHAT YOU MIGHT NEED,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.960
BUT IF YOU WANT TO
BRIDGE THAT GAP,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.660
WE NEED TO GO
TO THE SUN.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.430
MORE ENERGY FROM THE SUN
HITS THE EARTH IN ONE HOUR

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.260
THAN ALL THE ENERGY CONSUMED
BY HUMANS ON OUR PLANET

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
IN AN ENTIRE YEAR.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.560
THAT MEANS EVEN IF WE ONLY
TOOK A TINY FRACTION

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.800
OF WHAT HITS THE EARTH,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.400
WE WOULD STILL MAKE MORE ENERGY
THAN WE COULD EVER DREAM

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.700
OF USING
AS A CIVILIZATION.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.530
Haile: WE LOVE SOLAR BECAUSE
WE HAVE SO MUCH OF IT.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.400
Man: THE ONLY SOLUTION
THAT SEEMS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.960
IS TO SOMEHOW USE SUNLIGHT
TO POWER THE PLANET.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.260
Lewis: THE PROBLEM WITH THE SUN
IS IT HAS THIS NASTY HABIT--

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.500
IT GOES OUT LOCALLY
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.430
AND PEOPLE NEED ENERGY
AT NIGHT, TOO.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.960
SO UNLESS YOU CAN
STORE SUNLIGHT,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.730
YOU CAN NEVER USE IT
TO MAKE PRIMARY ENERGY

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.660
FOR THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY NEED IT
AND WHERE THEY NEED IT.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.400
SOLAR CELLS ARE ONE PART
OF THE SOLUTION.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.560
SO SOLAR CELLS
PROVIDE ELECTRICITY.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.230
BUT UNLESS WE STORE IT,

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.260
THAT MEANS WE CAN ONLY
PROVIDE PEOPLE ENERGY

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
BETWEEN 10 A.M.
AND 4 P.M.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.900
ON A SUNNY DAY IN ARIZONA
OR IN CALIFORNIA.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.400
[THUNDER]

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.230
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT
RAINS IN BOSTON?

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.300
[HORNS HONKING]

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.100
Man: THERE'S A BIG CHUNK
OF ENERGY

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.960
THAT WON'T BE DERIVED
FROM SOLAR CELLS.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.930
BUT IT MIGHT BE DERIVED
FROM SOMETHING HOOKED UP TO,

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.600
YOU KNOW, SORT OF A CREATIVE
ADAPTATION OF SOLAR CELLS

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.460
THAT CAN ALSO BE USED
TO THEN MAKE FUEL.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.260
Haile: WHAT THAT MEANS IS
TAKING THAT SOLAR ENERGY

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.760
AND CONVERTING IT
INTO A CHEMICAL FUEL

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.260
RATHER THAN CONVERTING IT
TO ELECTRICITY.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.930
Peters: AND THAT FUEL IN ITS
SIMPLEST FORM IS HYDROGEN.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.760
THE SUN ALREADY POWERS THE
PLANET THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS,

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.230
AND WE ALL SEE THAT
EVERY DAY.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.930
THE SUN SHINES
ON THE EARTH,

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.130
AND PLANTS TAKE SUNLIGHT,
WATER, AND CARBON DIOXIDE

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.800
AND TURN THAT INTO A FUEL.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.700
IT SOUNDS PRETTY SIMPLE,

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.500
BUT THE MACHINERY
THAT THEY USE TO DO THAT

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.200
IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX
CHEMICAL MACHINE.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.660
THE QUESTION IS, CAN YOU EXTRACT
THE ESSENCE OF HOW IT WORKS

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.960
AND PROVIDE A FUEL SOURCE FOR
THE PLANET FOR THE LONG HAUL?

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.800
AND THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY COOL
PROBLEM TO SOLVE.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.100
Lewis: WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO
IS ARTIFICIAL PHOTOSYNTHESIS,

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:41.260
IN ESSENCE, BUILD A MECHANICAL
VERSION OF A LEAF.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.600
FIND A SYSTEM
THAT TAKES SUNLIGHT

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.900
AND WATER AS THE ONLY
TWO INPUTS,

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.760
AND OUT COMES HYDROGEN
AS THE FUEL.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.100
Peters: IN ESSENCE,
TAKE H2O

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.430
AND STRIP THE HYDROGEN
OUT OF H2O,

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.760
WHICH TAKES ENERGY,

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:02.130
AND THE ENERGY TO PULL THAT H2
OUT OF H20 IS JUST SUNLIGHT.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.230
THIS IS AN AREA THAT'S
REALLY CAUGHT IN BETWEEN

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.260
2 THINGS THAT PEOPLE
HEAR ABOUT ON THE STREET.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
EVERYBODY'S SEEN SOLAR CELLS.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.400
EVERYBODY'S SEEN PLANTS.
AND WE'RE TRYING

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.160
TO GET INTO
THE MIDDLE GROUND,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.560
WHERE PEOPLE REALLY
HAVEN'T GONE BEFORE.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.630
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JUST TRYING
TO USE PLANTS AND MAKE FUEL.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.560
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE FUEL,

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.530
BUT WITH THE MATERIALS
THAT MAKE SOLAR CELLS.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.130
THIS PROBLEM HAS
MANY PIECES TO IT.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.360
THE FIRST IMPORTANT PIECE

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.830
IS TO TAKE THE SUNLIGHT
DIRECTLY BY ABSORBING IT

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.830
AND TO CONVERT ITS ENERGY
INTO ELECTRIC CHARGES.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.830
AND THE THING THAT GIVES US
THAT ELECTRIC CHARGE

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.500
WILL BE SOME REALLY CHEAP
IMPLEMENTATION,

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.360
LIKE SOLAR PAINT.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.600
THOSE PARTICLES
IN THAT PASTE

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.660
ARE THE PIGMENT
IN WHITE PAINT--TITANIA.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.660
WHEN HE DRAGS
THAT SQUEEGEE

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.030
ACROSS THAT
SILK-SCREENING PRINTER,

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.260
SOME OF THOSE PARTICLES
GO THROUGH,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:02.060
AND THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE
A FILM ONTO A GLASS SLIDE.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.160
THE SECRET TO GET THIS
TO ABSORB SUNLIGHT

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.830
IS THIS DYE.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:12.660
WE TAKE THAT WHITE PAINT
AND DUNK IT INTO A SOLUTION

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.000
THAT GETS SUCKED
ONTO THAT WHITE MATERIAL

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.130
AND MAKES IT COLORED.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.800
AND THIS DYE, ON THIS SMALL,
TINY TITANIA PARTICLE

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.700
CAN TAKE THE ENERGY
FROM SUNLIGHT,

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.230
CAPTURE THAT ENERGY,
AND IT PRODUCES ELECTRICITY.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.900
AND IT'S REALLY CHEAP.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.600
Peters: SO WHAT
WE WANT TO BUILD

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.430
IS AN ARTIFICIAL
PHOTOSYNTHESIS DEVICE

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.930
THAT HAS 4 COMPONENTS.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:45.930
IT HAS SUNLIGHT, A MEMBRANE,
CATALYSTS, AND WATER.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.460
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
IS SPLIT WATER.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.600
AND SO YOU NEED CATALYSTS
THAT FACILITATE

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.630
SPLITTING WATER.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.260
A CATALYST IS SOMETHING TH

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.800
HAPPEN FASTER,R.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.560
SO LET'S SAY YOU'RE
SITTING THERE IN BED

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.930
AND YOU NEED TO GO TO SCHOOL,
AND YOUR MOM COMES IN

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.530
AND TELLS YOU,
"GET OUT OF BED,

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.160
BECAUSE YOU NEED
TO GO TO SCHOOL."

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.130
THAT'S THE CATALYST
DURING THAT SCENARIO. OK?

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.230
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.360
BUT JUST NEEDED
TO BE SPEEDED UP.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.400
SO THAT'S WHAT
THE CATALYST DOES.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.900
Peters: WHEN YOU SPLIT WATER,
YOU REMOVE ELECTRONS AND PROTONS

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.060
FROM WATER, AND THOSE
PROTONS AND ELECTRONS

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.330
FLOW ACROSS THE MEMBRANE

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.830
AND GET RECOMBINED
ON THE OTHER SIDE

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.430
OF THE MEMBRANE
TO FORM HYDROGEN.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:39.100
THAT IS YOUR ULTIMATE
FUEL SOURCE.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.430
YOU CAN THINK OF THAT DEVICE
AS BUBBLE WRAP...

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:47.260
THAT YOU WOULD JUST GET
FROM THE HARDWARE STORE

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.500
WITH THE SOLAR PAINT IN IT...

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.730
UNROLL THE BUBBLE WRAP
ON YOUR ROOF,

00:11:54.730 --> 00:12:01.130
FEED IN WATER, AND OUT WILL COME
HYDROGEN AS THE FUEL.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.400
THESE SYSTEMS--YOU'D
PUT THEM ON A FARM,

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.460
YOU COULD PUT THEM ON TOP
OF A FACTORY BUILDING,

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.400
PUT THEM ALL OVER
THE PLACE

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.330
TO GENERATE ALL OF OUR ENERGY
FOREVER FROM THE SUN.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.730
Haile: SO WE'VE GOT
HYDROGEN AS A FUEL.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.100
WELL, WHAT DO WE
DO WITH IT?

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.100
THAT'S WHERE
FUEL CELLS COME IN.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.400
SO WE GOT SOLAR ENERGY

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.500
INTO OUR ADVANCED SOLAR
PANELS OF THE FUTURE.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.830
THEY GIVE US, THEN,
THE FUEL, WHICH IS HYDROGEN.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.260
WE THEN TAKE THAT FUEL,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.760
AND WE PUT IT
INTO THIS OTHER BOX,

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.760
AND OUT COMES ELECTRICITY.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.760
THAT BOX IS CALLED
A FUEL CELL.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.700
[BELL DINGING]

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.500
SO IT'S LIKE A BATTERY,
IN THE SENSE THAT YOU

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.330
PUT YOUR LEADS ON THERE
AND YOU GET ELECTRICITY,

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.530
JUST LIKE
IN YOUR CAR BATTERY.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.930
BUT IT'S LIKE
A COMBUSTION ENGINE

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.930
IN THE SENSE
THAT YOU PUT FUEL IN.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.600
Haile: FUEL CELLS ARE DEFINITELY
NOT A NEW TECHNOLOGY.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.160
IT'S OVER A HUNDRED YEARS
SINCE THEY'VE BEEN NOW.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.900
SAME TIME AS BATTERIES,

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.730
SORT OF THE ELECTRIC CHEMISTRY
WAS UNDERSTOOD.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.900
IN FACT, THE FIRST FUEL CELL
WAS INVENTED IN 1839

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.560
BY SIR WILLIAM GROVE,

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.530
AND SINCE THEN, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
WORKING ON FUEL CELLS A LOT.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.760
INSIDE OF IT ESSENTIALLY
IS 2 CHAMBERS--

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:21.400
THE FUEL CHAMBER
AND THEN THE AIR CHAMBER.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.400
SO WE HAVE HYDROGEN HERE,
WE HAVE OXYGEN HERE,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.230
AND WE KEEP THEM
SEPARATED BY A MEMBRANE.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.330
NOW, HERE YOU POTENTIALLY
HAVE WATER, H2O,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.960
LIKE BOYS AND GIRLS
AT A HIGH-SCHOOL DANCE,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.500
THEY REALLY WANT
TO GET BACK TOGETHER.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.600
THIS MEMBRANE IS
BASICALLY JUST A SHEET

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.760
OF A SPECIAL MATERIAL.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.730
AND THE WAY THAT
OUR MATERIAL WORKS

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.430
IS THAT THIS MEMBRANE IS WHAT'S
CALLED A PROTON CONDUCTOR.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:49.100
ONLY PROTONS CAN GO ACROSS,
NOTHING ELSE.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.560
WELL, KEEP IN MIND THAT HYDROGEN
REALLY IS JUST A PROTON

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.760
PLUS AN ELECTRON.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.600
IF THAT HYDROGEN CAN
DROP OFF ITS ELECTRON,

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.600
IT CAN NOW BECOME
A PROTON

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.560
THAT CAN GET THROUGH
THE MEMBRANE.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.930
BUT BASICALLY, WHEN THE ELECTRON
WANTS TO GO THROUGH,

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.060
IT'S, "NO. NO, YOU CAN'T
COME THROUGH HERE."

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.900
SO THE ELECTRONS GO THROUGH
SOME EXTERIOR CIRCUIT,

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.330
AND ON THEIR WAY, WE MAKE THEM
DO SOME WORK FOR US.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.060
YOU'VE GOT TO TURN ON
MY LIGHT BULB.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.730
OK? YOU GOT TO
MAKE MY COMPUTER WORK.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.400
YOU GOT TO MAKE
MY TV WORK.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.060
YOU GOT TO MAKE
MY STEREO WORK.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.060
YOU GOT TO TURN ON
THE HEATER.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:27.060
NOW THE ELECTRONS GO AROUND,
AND AT THE SAME TIME,

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.830
THE PROTONS ARE MAKING THEIR WAY
ACROSS THE MEMBRANE,

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.660
AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE MEMBRANE,

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.760
THE ELECTRONS, THE PROTONS,
THE OXYGEN ALL MEET TOGETHER,

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.500
AND WE PRODUCE WATER
AS A BY-PRODUCT.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.600
IF HYDROGEN IS USED
AS THE FUEL INPUT,

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.360
THEN THE EXHAUST
IS PURE, CLEAN WATER.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.760
WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT BE
ADDING TO GLOBAL WARMING

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.100
IN THAT SCENARIO.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT A FUEL CELL,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.860
ESSENTIALLY IT ALL
BOILS DOWN TO--

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.430
WHAT IS THIS MEMBRANE
MATERIAL MADE OUT OF, OK?

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.230
WE WERE ACTUALLY
SOSSINA'S FIRST
2 GRAD STUDENTS,

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.960
NUMBER ONE
AND NUMBER TWO.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.560
SHE SHOWED US THESE
PARTICULAR MATERIALS

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.760
THAT HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED
SUPERPROTONIC PHASE TRANSITIONS.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.230
AND I WAS, LIKE, "WHOA!"

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.000
IT'S A NEW CLASS
OF MATERIALS,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.860
WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN
INVESTIGATED BEFORE.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.300
IT'S SUPERPROTONIC.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.900
THAT'S ALL
I NEED TO KNOW.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.660
THAT WAS THE SELLING
POINT, FOR SURE.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.730
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
WE REALLY WORKED ON

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.930
UNDERSTANDING
THE THERMODYNAMICS

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:32.030
THAT MAKE THESE MATERIALS
DO WHAT THEY DO.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.860
AND WE ACTUALLY TOOK
THE MATERIALS,

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.930
SMASHED THEM TOGETHER TO MAKE
THIS SPECIAL MEMBRANE,

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.130
AND CREATED ELECTRICITY
FROM HYDROGEN.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.460
AND RIGHT NOW, WE'RE
DEFINITELY DOING THIS

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.730
IN A CRUDE MANNER,

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.230
BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.030
TO BASICALLY MAKE THIS

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.360
A HIGHLY REFINED
COMMERCIAL PROCESS.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.100
SO YOU'RE BASICALLY
MAKING A SANDWICH--

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.300
MEMBRANE, AND THEN WE HAVE
HYDROGEN ELECTRODE

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.600
AND OXYGEN ELECTRODE, OK?

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.300
THINK OF THEM
AS PIECES OF THE BREAD.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.700
AND WE'VE JUST
SMASHED IT ALL TOGETHER.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.560
GO, BESSIE.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.530
HA HA HA.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.200
THIS IS BESSIE,
BESSIE THE PRESS.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.060
SHE DOES
ALL OUR HARD WORK.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.400
Chisholm: BIG COMPANIES,
THEY'VE BEEN REALLY PUSHING

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:20.800
SINCE THE LATE 1950s TO MAKE
A COMMERCIAL FUEL CELL PRODUCT.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.730
WHY DON'T WE HAVE ONE?

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:27.060
WELL, THE PROBLEM IS
THAT ESSENTIALLY...

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.930
THAT SPECIAL MATERIAL,
THAT MEMBRANE.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.000
MANY DIFFERENT TYPES
OF MEMBRANES THEY'VE USED,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.760
BUT THEY ALL HAD BASICALLY
AN ACHILLES HEEL,

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.630
EITHER NOT BEING
VERY DURABLE

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.530
OR MAYBE HAVING
VERY LOW PERFORMANCE OR--

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.930
AND THIS IS THE ONE THAT
PRETTY MUCH KILLS THEM ALL--

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:43.130
COSTING WAY TOO MUCH.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.900
OURS IS THE FIRST
NEW TYPE OF MEMBRANE
IN HALF A CENTURY.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.100
OUR MISSION IS TO GET
OUR FUEL CELLS, YOU KNOW,

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.430
INTO EVERY HOUSEHOLD.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:58.930
ONE CELL WOULD POWER MAYBE
YOUR PORTABLE CELL PHONE.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.830
BUT IF YOU WANT MORE POWER,

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.730
YOU PUT THOSE CELLS TOGETHER
IN WHAT'S CALLED A STACK.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:07.400
AND THAT STACK THEN GETS PUT
INTO YOUR FUEL CELL GENERATOR

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.400
AND GENERATES ELECTRICITY
FOR YOUR HOME.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.660
YOU CAN USE IT
IN YOUR CAR

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.530
OR AT YOUR LOCAL
POWER PLANT

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.360
TO GIVE POWER
TO YOUR CITY.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.230
Peters: LEARNING HOW
TO TAKE WATER

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.600
TO A STORABLE CHEMICAL FUEL
VIA SUNLIGHT

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.200
IS PROBABLY THE GRAND CHALLENGE
OF THE 21st CENTURY.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.700
WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY
BRIDGE THAT GAP

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.960
BETWEEN INNOVATION
AND COMMERCIALIZATION.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.200
IT'S ONE THING
TO MAKE IT IN THE LAB.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.800
IT'S ANOTHER THING TO
MAKE THOUSANDS OF THEM

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.000
REPRODUCIBLY
FOR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.330
I'M HOPEFUL
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT,

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.930
BUT WE WON'T
FIGURE OUT SOMETHING

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.100
THAT WILL BE WORKABLE
IN THE SHORT-TERM FUTURE.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.200
THIS IS A LONG-TERM GOAL.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.560
WE WILL INDEED
HAVE TO USE FOSSIL FUELS.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.960
WE'RE GOING TO USE IT
FOR THE NEXT 20 OR 30 YEARS,

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.560
BECAUSE THESE SOLUTIONS
AREN'T HAPPENING

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.500
IN A TIME FRAME
FASTER THAN THAT.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.160
Lewis: WE'VE GOT TO KEEP
PLUGGING AWAY AT THIS PROBLEM

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.300
WITH THE SMARTEST PEOPLE
WE'VE GOT

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.900
TO SEE IF WE CAN SEE
OUR WAY CLEAR.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.260
Peters: I MEAN,
IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.860
SECURITY FOR
THE UNITED STATES,

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.800
WELL, HOW ABOUT MAKING
THE UNITED STATES

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.160
TOTALLY
ENERGY-INDEPENDENT

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.400
AND DOING IT IN A WAY
THAT DOESN'T HARM

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.130
THE GLOBE AND IMPACT
GLOBAL WARMING?

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.360
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW LONG
IT'S GOING TO TAKE.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.860
IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DO,
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T DO IT,

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.330
THE CONSEQUENCES
ARE TOO DIRE.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.730
WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO CITY OF HOPE NOW,

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:53.500
AND IT'S ALMOST 9:30
IN THE MORNING.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.200
THE PATIENT SHOULD BE ARRIVING
AT CITY OF HOPE AS WELL.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.930
[WATER RUNNING]

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:12.330
OH, IT WAS
A FAIRLY RESTLESS NIGHT,

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.000
BUT I JUST KEPT ROLLING
THROUGH IN MY MIND

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.060
ABOUT THIS NEW
NANOPARTICLE DRUG.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.700
DID WE DO
EVERYTHING RIGHT?

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.100
YOU KNOW, WE PREPARED.
EVERYTHING IS READY TO GO.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.160
BUT IT'S STILL,
YOU KNOW,

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.930
THE FIRST TIME
IN THE FIRST HUMAN.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.100
BYE.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.230
THIS MORNING
REMINDED ME A LOT--

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.000
I WAS A TRACK RUNNER.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.160
IT'S KIND OF THAT, YOU KNOW,
YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.760
WHEN THERE'S
A BIG COMPETITION,

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.460
AND YOU KIND OF HAVE
THAT JITTERS...

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:50.500
THAT CAUTIOUS NERVOUSNESS.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.900
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATION]

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.330
DR. YEN ARRIVED
WAY BEFORE I DID.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.500
HE'S THE ONE
WHO HAS TO MAKE SURE

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.660
THAT THE TRIAL RUNS THE WAY
IT'S SUPPOSED TO RUN.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.900
Yen: EVERYBODY'S EXCITED.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.860
THERE IS SOME ANXIETY.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.830
I DID MENTION TO MY WIFE

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:26.230
ANTY
FOR ME, TOO.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.430
WHO'S YOUR PROTOCOL NURSE?
IS IT MARY?
YES.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.530
I'M 53 YEARS OLD.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:37.000
IN THE YEAR 2002,
THEY DIAGNOSED ME WITH CANCER.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.100
YOU ARE TOO QUICK
TO WANT TO JAB ON ME.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.160
2002 WAS AN IMPORTANT YEAR
BECAUSE I GOT MARRIED.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.760
OK,
AND BREATHE OUT.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.930
AND 2 MONTHS LATER,
THEY DIAGNOSED ME

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.360
WITH PANCREATIC CANCER.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.600
AND IT'S OVER
IN A JIFF.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.860
I HAD THE SURGERY,

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.200
AND FOR ABOUT A YEAR
AND A HALF, I WAS OK.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.200
AND THEN IT CAME BACK AGAIN,
AND NOW IT'S IN A LUNG.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.300
I WAS TAKING CHEMO.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.830
IT WORKED FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS,
AND THEN IT DID NOT WORK

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.060
ON MY CANCER,
PARTICULAR CANCER.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.700
SO I WAS SUGGESTED
TO GO IN A STUDY.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:26.330
Davis: THE PHASE-ONE TRIAL
IS ALL ABOUT SAFETY.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.330
PEOPLE WHO GO
INTO THESE TRIALS,

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.130
YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM
A LOT OF CREDIT.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:34.600
THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.100
THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.430
YOU'RE PUTTING THIS NEW THING
INTO A HUMAN.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:39.930
HOW SAFE IS IT?

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.360
OK.
SO, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.930
I'M DOING FINE.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.260
Yen: HE UNDERSTANDS
THAT THE STANDARD TREATMENT

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.460
PROBABLY MAY NOT BENEFIT HIM
ANYTHING MORE.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.060
SO HE'S WILLING
TO TRY ANYTHING NEW.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:54.430
THIS IS A NEW THING,

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.930
AND LOTS OF STORIES
AND INVENTION BEHIND THAT,

00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:00.860
AND DR. MARK DID
THE RESEARCH FOR 10 YEARS.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.830
SO THIS IS
AN EXCITING MOMENT.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:05.300
HE'S SHARING THE SAME
EXCITEMENT AS US.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.830
MINE'S HIGH. MY BLOOD
PRESSURE IS HIGH.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.560
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO SEE WHAT IT DOES

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.160
TO A HUMAN BODY,
TO MY BODY,

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.800
AND THIS HOPEFULLY
WILL WORK.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:32.500
Yen: ABOUT 11:25,
WE START TO INFUSE

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:38.000
THE IT-101 NANOPARTICLE
TO OUR VERY FIRST PATIENT.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.600
Davis: I WAS CONSTANTLY
WATCHING THE MONITORS,

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.330
WATCHING HIM.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.230
FIRST IN HUMANS, YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.760
DO YOU HAVE
ANY PAIN?

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.930
NO.

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.100
A HEADACHE?

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.330
NO.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.130
ANY ITCH?
NO. NOTHING.

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.600
Yen: FOR THERAPEUTIC
RESEARCH,

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.460
WE ARE ALWAYS FACING
SO MUCH UNCERTAINTIES

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.300
BECAUSE THAT'S SO NEW.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.900
Davis: YOU GO DOWN
IN A LAB AND CREATE

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.960
A LITTLE BIT
OF THIS STUFF.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.400
BUT IT'S JUST EXCEEDINGLY RARE
TO BE A FACULTY MEMBER

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.230
AT A UNIVERSITY AND TO BE
SITTING THERE

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:24.900
CHATTING WITH
THE FIRST PATIENT.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.930
SO, YOU KNOW, YOU
WENT ALL THE WAY
THROUGH THE TRIAL.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.360
IT'S REALLY PERSONAL NOW.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.600
IT'S JUST NOT A BUNCH OF NUMBERS
ON A PIECE OF PAPER.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.860
TREMENDOUS EXCITEMENT
TO GET IT IN THAT DAY

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.530
AND NOT SEE THAT WE WERE
HAVING ANY PROBLEMS.

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:55.460
BUT THE QUESTION IS REALLY...

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.900
IS IT GOING TO WORK?

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.330
10 YEARS WAS A LONG TIME
TO GET INTO PATIENTS,

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.230
AND NOW THAT YOU'RE
THERE, YOU KNOW,

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.900
YOU'RE IN A HURRY,
YOU WANT TO SEE IT.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.900
YOU WANT TO SEE WHETHER
WE WERE GOING TO HAVE

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.130
ANY EFFECTS ON THE TUMOR.

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.560
BUT THAT'S THE ONE THING
CANCER TEACHES YOU,

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.060
IS IT TEACHES YOU
TO BE PATIENT.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.760
IN NINTH GRADE, I RAN
THE FASTEST TIME IN THE COUNTRY

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.260
FOR THE 400, WHICH IS
ONE LAP AROUND.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.160
AND SO FROM THAT TIME,

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.760
THE ONLY THING I WORRIED ABOUT
WAS I WANTED TO GET AROUND

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.560
THAT TRACK FASTER THAN
ANYBODY ELSE IN THE COUNTRY,

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.400
BUT WHEN I GOT TO COLLEGE,

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.830
IT JUST SEEMED LIKE,
FOR A LITTLE GUY LIKE ME,

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:55.430
I WAS OK, BUT I WASN'T
WORLD-CLASS.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.500
I KNEW AT SOME POINT IN TIME,

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.600
I WAS GOING TO
HAVE TO QUIT THAT

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.360
AND ACTUALLY GO GET
A REAL JOB.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.400
I'M A CHEMICAL ENGINEER.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.400
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
IS KIND OF A MARRIAGE

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.560
OF CHEMISTRY
AND MATHEMATICS.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.300
I REMEMBER WHEN I
STARTED AS A STUDENT,

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.360
I SAID, "WELL,
THAT'S KIND OF COOL.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.230
I WANT TO DO
BOTH OF THOSE THINGS."

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:20.900
THEN WHEN I HEARD
IT'S USUALLY

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.500
THE MOST CHALLENGING
DISCIPLINE ON CAMPUS,

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.060
I SAID, "THAT'S FOR ME."

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.100
I CHOSE TO GO
THE RESEARCH PATHWAY.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.230
OVER THE YEARS,
WE'VE BUILT THINGS

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.800
LIKE CRYSTALS
AND POLYMERS,

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.430
AND THEY'RE USED IN A VARIETY
OF DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS,

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:38.160
SUCH AS PLASTICS.

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:42.000
TODAY WE WOULD CALL THIS
NANOTECHNOLOGY.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.500
BACK THEN, WE REALLY
DIDN'T HAVE A NAME FOR IT.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.760
THIS ONE IS BETTER.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.860
IF SOMEONE HAD SAID
10 YEARS AGO

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.100
THAT MY EXPERIENCE
AS A CHEMICAL ENGINEER

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.830
WOULD HELP ME COME UP
WITH A NEW CANCER TREATMENT,

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.760
I WOULD HAVE SAID NO WAY.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.560
I HAD A SUCCESSFUL CAREER.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.230
YOU KNOW, I HAD
A BIG RESEARCH PROGRAM.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.530
EVERYTHING WAS
GOING ALONG FINE.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.300
BUT THAT WAS BEFORE
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY WIFE.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.430
Woman: SO I WAS PUTTING
ON SOME DRESSES,

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:20.000
AND MY LUMP WAS
WAY UNDER MY ARM,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.560
AND IT WASN'T A LUMP
ON MY BREAST.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.560
IT WAS JUST A LUMP
UNDER MY ARM,

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.430
AND YOU COULD
HARDLY FEEL IT.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:32.730
I WENT TO THE DOCTOR,
AND THEY DID A NEEDLE BIOPSY.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:37.500
I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM
THE DOCTOR SAYING IT'S CANCER.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.930
AND IT JUST TOTALLY,
TOTALLY SHOCKED ME.

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:45.930
I HAD TWIN BOYS WHO WERE 3
AND STILL IN DIAPERS,

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:50.700
AND I HAD A DAUGHTER
WHO WAS 5 AND IN KINDERGARTEN.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.260
AND YOU THINK ABOUT
HOW OLD THEY'RE GOING TO BE

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.660
WHEN YOU DIE.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.260
I MEAN, MARK CAME HOME,

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.500
IMMEDIATELY CANCELED EVERYTHING
THAT HE HAD ON HIS DOCKET.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.330
Mark: YOU GO FROM BEING
SOMEONE WHO'S A CONTROL--

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.800
WE'RE ALL CONTROL FREAKS;

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.060
BELIEVE ME, EVERY FACULTY MEMBER
IS A CONTROL FREAK--

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:14.730
TO ACTUALLY HAVING EVERYTHING
TAKEN OUT OF YOUR CONTROL.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:18.060
YOU KNOW, YOUR NICE
COMFORTABLE LIFE

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.560
GETS, YOU KNOW,
ALL OF A SUDDEN DESTROYED.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.730
Mary: WITHIN A 2-WEEK PERIOD,

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:25.730
I HAD GONE THROUGH
ALL KINDS OF TESTS

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:28.660
AND HAD A MASTECTOMY.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.800
AND THEN THE THIRD
DOCTOR I SAW

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.830
JUST RECOMMENDED A REALLY,
REALLY AGGRESSIVE

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:35.230
FORM OF CHEMOTHERAPY.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.500
I HAD A DRUG
CALLED ADRIAMYCIN,

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.860
AND IT'S NICKNAMED
"THE RED DEATH."

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.000
AND THAT'S WHAT
IT REALLY FELT LIKE.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:51.730
I WOULD LAY IN BED AND THROW UP
CONTINUOUSLY FOR 2 DAYS,

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:55.530
NOT EAT, HAIR LOSS.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:59.930
YOU'RE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE
TO INFECTION.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:03.400
I MEAN, YOU JUST GET SO WEAK.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.460
Mark: YOUR FOCUS TURNS INTO
BATTLING THE TREATMENT.

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:11.230
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
IS SURVIVE THE TREATMENTS.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:14.900
Mary: IT'S REALLY HARD TO GO
INTO A DOCTOR'S OFFICE

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.900
AND TO PUT SOMETHING
IN YOUR VEINS

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.930
THAT YOU KNOW IS
GOING TO MAKE YOU SICK.

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:22.400
YEAH, THINKING
ABOUT IT NOW,

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.460
JUST, YOU KNOW, BRINGING UP
THESE MEMORIES, I...

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.830
YOU LIKE TO THINK THERE'S
A REASON FOR EVERYTHING,

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:33.760
AND SOMETIMES
I LIKE TO THINK

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.000
THAT THERE'S A REASON
THAT I GOT SICK.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
WHEN I WAS LITERALLY
THROWING UP EVERY DAY,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
ALMOST EVERY HOUR
FOR A WHOLE MONTH.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.730
I WOULD TURN
TO HIM AND SAY,

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:46.530
"MARK, THERE'S GOT TO BE
A BETTER WAY.

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:49.430
"YOU KNOW, YOU'VE
GOT TO FIND OUT

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.500
"HOW TO HAVE THE TREATMENT,
GET RID OF THE CANCER,

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.960
BUT NOT GO THROUGH
ALL THESE SIDE EFFECTS."

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.200
Mark: WHEN SHE SAID,
"THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY,"

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.100
THAT WAS REALLY
THE TURNING POINT.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:03.900
CANCER--WHAT DID
I KNOW ABOUT IT?

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.330
IT WAS WAY OUT
OF MY COMFORT ZONE

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:08.830
FROM A SCIENTIFIC
POINT OF VIEW.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:13.100
MARY SAID, "WELL, WHAT KIND
OF EXCUSE IS THAT?

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.160
"YOU PEOPLE OVER AT CALTECH
ARE SMART.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.000
"YOU GUYS
HAVE A HISTORY

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.760
"OF BEING ABLE TO SOLVE
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:22.000
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T YOU
WORK ON IT?"

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.730
EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:37.660
Ray: CANCER IS NO JOKE,

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.430
BUT TREATMENT IS WORSE.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.330
AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE CANCER,

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:44.300
I TOOK ABOUT
3 MONTHS CHEMO.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:48.330
MORE OR LESS, YOU'RE WALKING
LIKE A LIVING ZOMBIE.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:51.030
IT WAS HELL ON EARTH FOR ME.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.760
CHEMO WASN'T WORKING.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.600
MY CELLS WAS DOUBLING.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.360
MY CANCER WAS
SPREADING SO FAST.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:02.000
I'M IN ONE DAY FOR CHEMO,
SO I ASKED THE ONCOLOGIST,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.060
"WHY AM I GOING THROUGH THIS
WHEN IT'S NOT WORKING?"

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:10.630
WELL, THEY FOUND IT HARD
TO BREAK IT TO ME, BUT I KNEW.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:12.560
THEY TOLD ME
2 TO 6 MONTHS.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.160
THE WAY I WAS FEELING,

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:18.230
I KNEW THAT I WOULDN'T EVEN
LAST 6 MONTHS.

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:20.900
AND I JUST WENT HOME
WITH MY WIFE,

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.230
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT SPENDING
A COUPLE OF MONTHS,

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.630
WHAT I HAVE
WITH MY WIFE.

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:28.700
AND I WAS MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT HER WELL-BEING,

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.160
MY MOTHER'S WELL-BEING.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.000
I CALLED MY CHILDREN FROM
NEW ZEALAND, FROM AUSTRALIA.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.630
EVERYBODY CAME THAT TIME.

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.960
SO IT WAS TIME TO ORGANIZE
EVERYTHING FOR THEM

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:41.000
SO THAT THEY DON'T SUFFER
AFTER I'M GONE.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.760
ABOUT 2 MONTHS,
2 1/2 MONTHS PASS,

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.500
AND MY ONCOLOGIST
CALLED ME.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.660
HE ASKED ME IF I WANTED
TO JOIN A STUDY.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.860
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I WASN'T HOPEFUL

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.660
THAT IT'S GOING TO HELP ME.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.930
BUT AT LEAST IT WILL
HELP SOMEBODY ELSE.

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:57.260
AND YOUR LAST NAME?

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.660
NATHA. N-A-T-H-A.

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.760
OK. AND DO YOU HAVE
AN ARM BAND ON?

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.400
NO, I HAVEN'T.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.200
OK. LET ME
GET YOU ONE.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.830
OK. HAVE A SEAT,
AND I'LL LET THEM

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:09.700
KNOW YOU'RE HERE, OK?
THANK YOU.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.660
HA HA HA!

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:35.430
NOW, WHEN I GOT TO HOSPITAL,
VERY FIRST TREATMENT,

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.760
THEY'RE LOCKING EVERYBODY ELSE
IN A SMALL ROOM--

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.260
NURSES, DOCTORS,
EVERYBODY CHECKING.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:42.100
I WAS SECOND, AND THEY WERE
TAKING BLOOD, WHAT,

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.900
EVERY HALF AN HOUR?

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.230
ONLY IN TIME I LEARNED,

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:48.260
"YOU ARE THE FIRST ONE."

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.800
BY THEN I WAS ALREADY
UNDER THE TREATMENT.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.760
I KNEW
THAT IT WAS A STUDY,

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.900
BUT I THOUGHT SOMEBODY
MUST BE BEFORE ME.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.160
IT WAS A HAIR-RAISING MOMENT.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.000
IF THE MEDICATION
OR SOMETHING GOES WRONG,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.360
I FORGOT TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO MY WIFE.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.400
IF THEY'D TOLD ME,
I WOULD HAVE DONE IT,

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.230
PUT MY LIVING TRUST PROPERLY,

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:10.460
CALL MY CHILDREN
THE NIGHT BEFORE, AND THEN GO.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.630
Man: THIS TRIAL IS
REALLY ABOUT SEEING

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:21.400
WHAT IS IT LIKE TO INJECT
A NANOPARTICLE-CONTAINING DRUG

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.260
INTO A HUMAN.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:29.000
Mary: DR. FORMAN WAS MY DOCTOR
AT THE CITY OF HOPE.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.260
MARK JUST STARTED
TALKING TO HIM,

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:34.160
AND THAT'S HOW
IT ALL STARTED.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.760
Forman: WHILE MARY WAS HERE
AT CITY OF HOPE

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.800
UNDERGOING
A REALLY PROLONGED

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.760
AND INTENSIVE
AND HARSH TREATMENT,

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.230
MARK WOULD GO
TO THE LIBRARY

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:46.100
UNBEKNOWNST TO ANY OF US
AND BEGAN TO STUDY

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.600
WHAT WE KNEW,
NAMELY ABOUT CANCER.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.800
Mark: THE THING
IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.330
THE LITERATURE
IS ENORMOUS.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.560
IT'S LIKE THE NIAGARA FALLS.
IF YOU WANTED TO TRY

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.260
TO GET A DRINK AND YOU WERE
UNDERNEATH NIAGARA FALLS,

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:00.830
HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT?

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.600
BECAUSE IT WOULD JUST,
YOU KNOW, FLOOD YOU TO DEATH.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.060
Forman: WHAT HE WAS REALLY AFTER
WAS TO SEE

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:09.560
WHETHER WHAT HE WAS EXPERT AT
COULD BE USED TO DEVELOP

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.300
A BETTER APPROACH
TO TREATING CANCER.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.060
THERE WAS A POINT AT WHICH
HE ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTIONS

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.430
IN A VERY QUIET,
UNDERSTATED WAY.

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:22.230
Mark: STEVE CAME OVER
TO MY OFFICE AT CALTECH,

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:25.960
AND WE WENT ON THE WHITEBOARD
AND STARTED WORKING ON THINGS.

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:29.160
Forman: I REMEMBER
VERY DISTINCTLY

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:33.660
HIS DRAWING ON THE BOARD--
THE NANOPARTICLE.

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.430
I KNEW I HAD TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO MAKE A DRUG

00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:38.100
DO 2 MAJOR THINGS--

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.930
FIRST, IT HAD TO BE EFFECTIVE
AGAINST THE CANCER,

00:34:40.930 --> 00:34:44.700
AND SECOND, IT HAD TO HAVE
MINIMAL SIDE EFFECTS.

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:46.760
THE MAIN REASON
CONVENTIONAL CHEMO DRUGS,

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.430
LIKE THE ONE MARY TOOK,

00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:50.700
CAUSE SO MANY OF THESE
AWFUL SIDE EFFECTS

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:53.300
IS BECAUSE THEY'RE MADE UP
OF TINY MOLECULES,

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.430
SO TINY THAT THEY TRAVEL
THROUGH YOUR BLOODSTREAM,

00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:58.430
AND THEY LEAK OUT
OF YOUR BLOOD VESSELS

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:00.730
TO GO ALL OVER
YOUR BODY.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:04.060
SO THE STUFF YOU'RE TAKING
TO KILL THE CANCER CELLS

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.800
ALSO THEN CAN KILL
HEALTHY CELLS.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.560
BUT NANOPARTICLES ARE HUGE.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.060
COMPARE THAT TO, SAY,
A MOLECULE

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.630
OF A CONVENTIONAL CHEMO DRUG,

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.800
YOU CAN REALLY
SEE THE DIFFERENCE.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.730
IT-101, SINCE IT'S
A NANOPARTICLE,

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:22.900
IS TOO BIG TO LEAK OUT
OF NORMAL BLOOD VESSELS

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.230
AND GO INTO
THESE HEALTHY TISSUES.

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:27.560
AND SO HOPEFULLY
THAT WILL HELP ALLEVIATE

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.100
SOME OF THESE
SIDE EFFECTS.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.230
THE THING IS, TUMORS DON'T HAVE
NORMAL BLOOD VESSELS.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:38.760
WHEN TUMORS GET BIGGER
THAN A FEW MILLIMETERS,

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.430
WHICH IS ABOUT THE THICKNESS
OF A CREDIT CARD,

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.330
NOW THEY NEED
NEW BLOOD VESSELS

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:46.730
TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO GROW
AND GET MORE NUTRIENTS.

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.330
THEY'RE SMART, AND THEY
SEND OUT SIGNALS SAYING,

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:50.760
"GROW ME SOME NEW
BLOOD VESSELS.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.330
"BRING ME SOME MORE FOOD

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:54.760
SO I CAN CONTINUE
TO GROW AND GROW."

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.700
SO THESE NEW BLOOD VESSELS
ARE STRANGE.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.500
THEY ARE CHAOTIC. THEY'RE NOT
LIKE OUR NORMAL BLOOD VESSELS,

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.060
AND THEY HAVE
BIG HOLES IN THEM

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:08.230
THAT ALLOW THINGS LIKE IT-101
TO ESCAPE OUT OF THEM.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:13.500
OUR EXPECTATION IS, ONCE IT-101
GETS INSIDE OF A CANCER CELL,

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.860
IT'S A DONE DEAL.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:18.230
IT'S ALL OVER
FOR THE CANCER CELL.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.800
Forman: I WAS CONVINCED.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.600
YOU KNOW, WHAT HE THOUGHT OF,
WHAT HE DREW ON THE BOARD,

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.130
THERE'S SOMETHING HERE,
AND WE'VE GOT TO DO IT,

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:25.860
WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.430
Ray: SO I DID CHECK IN.
ARE MY FOLDERS HERE?

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.730
MY DREAM IS TO TRAVEL.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:36.530
IT'S THE BIGGEST DREAM--

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.600
TO TRAVEL
THE TRANS-ALASKAN HIGHWAY,

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.360
TO GO TO ALASKA,
ANCHORAGE, ALASKA.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.530
I WAS JUST PREPARING FOR THAT,
AND THE CANCER CAME,

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:46.530
AND I COULDN'T DO IT.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:48.660
SO I'M WAITING FOR NOW,

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:53.500
HOPING THAT IF THIS WORKS,
THIS IS MY DREAM.

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.260
Woman: HI.
COME ON IN.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.730
HI. THANKS.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:06.300
A C.T. SCAN TODAY?
YES.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.560
Mark: AS THE 2-MONTH MARK
WAS APPROACHING,

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.730
RAY WAS GOING TO GO IN
FOR HIS SCANS.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:12.330
I REALLY WANTED TO SEE
THE RESULTS.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.900
THE MACHINE'S
GOING TO BE TELLING YOU

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.730
TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN
AND HOLD IT.

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:18.030
AND EVERYONE WAS TELLING ME
TO STAY CALM, STAY CALM,

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:20.300
THAT YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE SOMETHING

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.430
THIS EARLY
IN A CLINICAL TRIAL.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:26.330
YOU KNOW, THE FIRST IN HUMAN,
FIRST PATIENT, LOWEST DOSE,

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:29.830
BUT I WANTED TO SEE IT
REAL BAD.

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:31.330
YEAH.
GOOD.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:33.360
SO, ANY PAIN?

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.600
NO. NO PAIN,
NOTHING.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.030
FEELING
VERY NICE.

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.600
THE GOOD NEWS WAS
WE WEREN'T SEEING SIDE EFFECTS.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.530
BUT IN THE BACK
OF MY MIND,

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:43.200
I'M REALLY WORRIED
THAT, GREAT,

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.700
MAYBE WE HAVE SOMETHING
THAT DOESN'T HAVE SIDE EFFECTS,

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.260
BUT IT ALSO DOESN'T DO
ANYTHING TO THE TUMOR.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.700
EXCELLENT.

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:54.760
THIS IS THE C.T. SCAN
DONE SEPTEMBER 15,

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.760
AND A RADIOLOGIST
HAS INTERPRETED THAT

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.330
AND COMPARED IT
TO THE PREVIOUS C.T. SCAN

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:02.400
DONE BEFORE THE TREATMENT.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.060
AND WE ARE
VERY GLAD TO SEE

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.260
THERE IS A NOTHING
PROGRESS AT ALL.

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:11.430
THERE IS NO...
ANY LESION BECOME BIGGER.

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:13.400
THAT'S VERY GOOD. YEAH.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.360
A C.T. SCAN SHOWED
THAT ALL THE LESIONS

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:20.100
REMAINED STABLE, AND THERE IS
NO NEW LESION CAN BE IDENTIFIED.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.560
AND WE WOULD LIKE
TO CONTINUE TO SEE

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.800
THIS KIND
OF A GOOD RESULT.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.600
Mark: FOR NOW,
JUST THE FACT

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.500
THAT YOU'VT BAY

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:37.060
AND NOT HAVE ANY OTHER NEW ONES
IN THIS FIRST SCAN

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.800
REALLY SHOWS YOU THAT YOU HAD
A REAL EFFECT ON THE DISEASE,

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.430
BECAUSE YOU WOULD
HAVE EXPECTED

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.160
THAT NOT ONLY WOULD THEY
HAVE INCREASED IN SIZE,

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:48.500
BUT THEY COULD HAVE ALSO
HAD NEW ONES GROW IN AS WELL.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:52.300
YOU HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN,
LIKE, DRAMATIC CHANGES,

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.930
SUCH AS DISAPPEAR
OR ANYTHING,

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:56.400
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
THAT'S TOO EARLY.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.260
AND WE ARE GOING TO
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.530
SO, NEXT C.T. SCAN,
2 MONTHS?

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:03.560
2 MONTHS FROM NOW.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.800
OK.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.560
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW,
KNOCK ON WOOD,

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.960
THINGS ARE PROGRESSING WELL.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.230
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.730
THIS IS GOOD NEWS.

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:14.160
WE WERE ACTUALLY HAVING
AN EFFECT ON HIM,

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:19.930
WHERE WE'RE NOT TAKING AWAY,
YOU KNOW, HIS QUALITY OF LIFE.

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:25.360
Yen: SO THEN I'LL LEAVE
THIS FILM HERE.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.030
HE'S NOT OUT
OF THE WOODS YET, OK?

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:30.200
HE'S STILL GOT
A LONG WAY TO GO. WE WON'T KNOW.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.500
HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE
TO GET TREATMENT,

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.530
AND, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE
WILL KEEP THEIR FINGERS CROSSED

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:41.330
THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'LL
CONTINUE TO SEE EFFECTS.

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:45.000
Ray: THIS IS
THE BEGINNING.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.560
THIS IS A BEGINNING.
YEAH.

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:07.530
Mark: AND IF YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS...

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:11.030
I MEAN, THERE WAS
NO REACTION, NOTHING.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.100
SO WE'LL GET
2 MORE INFUSIONS IN

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.000
NEXT TUESDAY
AND THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.500
INSERT THERAPEUTICS
IS THE COMPANY THAT WE FOUNDED

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.830
TO MAKE THE TRANSITION
FROM LABORATORY

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:22.430
TO EARLY CLINICAL TRIALS.

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:25.900
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
THAT HAVE TO BE DONE

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.660
NOT APPROPRIATE TO BE DONE
AT A UNIVERSITY,

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.130
LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE GAZILLION
PAGES OF REGULATIONS

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:36.260
THAT WE'D NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO
TO TAKE IT THROUGH THE F.D.A.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.930
AND SO WHEN YOU COME UP
WITH SOMETHING REALLY NEW,

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:40.600
YOU HAVE SEVERAL OPTIONS--

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.100
GO TAKE IT TO A BIG
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:46.930
AND JUST SAY, "HERE IT IS.
YOU GUYS GO TAKE IT."

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:49.230
OR THE OTHER IS--
THE APPROACH THAT WE LIKE IS,

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:52.300
YOU GO AND YOU START
A SMALL COMPANY.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.760
Mary: WE TALKED ABOUT IT,
AND WE TALKED TO OTHER PEOPLE

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.260
WHO HAD STARTED COMPANIES,
AND I REMEMBER ONE COMMENT

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:01.200
THAT A WIFE SAID TO ME.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.900
SHE SAID, "IS YOUR MARRIAGE
READY FOR IT?"

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.900
AND I WAS THINKING,
"YEAH. WELL, WHY NOT?"

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.430
YOU KNOW, WE GOT THROUGH CANCER,
AND WE GOT THROUGH THE TWINS,

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:15.030
AND WHAT'S...YOU KNOW, WHY WOULD
A COMPANY BE A PROBLEM?

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:17.930
IT WAS A ROUGH
DECADE, BELIEVE ME.

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:21.060
I FELT LIKE
A SINGLE MOM.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:25.400
IT WAS 10 YEARS
OF MARK WORKING DAY AND NIGHT,

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.400
EITHER AT CALTECH
OR WITH THE COMPANY.

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:33.160
WE REALLY HAD
NO EXPERIENCE AT ALL.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:37.100
WE STARTED FROM, YOU KNOW,
THE DONUT, FROM ZERO.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.000
WE DIDN'T HAVE
THE RIGHT LAB.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.430
WE DIDN'T HAVE
THE RIGHT BACKGROUND.

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:43.930
BUT IT WAS LIKE,
JUST WITH, LIKE, TRACK

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:45.930
AND WITH GOING INTO
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING,

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:48.760
IT WAS ANOTHER
BIG CHALLENGE.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:53.260
WITH IT-101, THE ENGINEERING
PART OF THE PROBLEM

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.100
WAS TO COMBINE
A POTENT CANCER DRUG

00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:02.260
WITH MATERIALS THAT GET IT
RIGHT INTO CANCER CELLS.

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:04.530
WE WANTED TO BUILD SOMETHING
LIKE A CUSTOM HOTROD.

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:06.900
THERE WERE PARTS
THAT PEOPLE KNEW OF,

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.060
BUT WE PUT THEM
TOGETHER IN A WAY

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:12.230
THAT NO ONE WAS ABLE
TO DO IN THE PAST.

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:15.500
THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCK
OF IT-101 IS A SUGAR.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.400
IT'S CALLED CYCLODEXTRIN,

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.330
AND IT WAS FIRST
DISCOVERED IN 1891.

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:23.230
IT'S NOW USED TO MAKE
LOW-CHOLESTEROL FOODS

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:26.400
AND TO MAKE HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS,
LIKE ODOR NEUTRALIZERS.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:30.130
BUT A SUGAR POLYMER
IS NOT GOING TO KILL A TUMOR.

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:33.500
THE CANCER-KILLING POWER
COMES FROM A PLANT EXTRACT

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:36.030
PRODUCED FROM
THE CAMPTOTHECA TREE,

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:39.660
WHICH GROWS MAINLY
IN CHINA AND TIBET.

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:41.430
ITS MEDICINAL PROPERTIES
HAVE BEEN KNOWN

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:43.630
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS
TO TREAT THINGS

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:46.260
LIKE PSORIASIS, COLDS,
AND STOMACH AILMENTS.

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.100
CAMPTOTHECA LEAVES
PRODUCE A MOLECULE

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.500
CALLED CAMPTOTHECIN.

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.100
IT'S EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.560
AGAINST A LOT OF DIFFERENT
TYPES OF CANCERS.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:58.030
BUT IT'S ALSO
EXTREMELY TOXIC.

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:01.000
SO CAMPTOTHECIN CAN'T BE
USED IN HUMANS

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.160
UNLESS YOU FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO KEEP IT FROM BEING SO TOXIC

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:07.900
UNTIL IT GETS
INTO THE TUMOR,

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.730
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU ATTACH IT

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:12.900
TO THE CYCLODEXTRIN POLYMER.

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.730
WHEN WE PUT IT IN WATER,
THESE POLYMER STRANDS

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:20.300
ZIP TOGETHER AND BECOME
THE IT-101 NANOPARTICLE.

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:24.900
THE CAMPTOTHECIN IS
CHEMICALLY TRANSFORMED,

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:27.730
MAKING IT WAY LESS TOXIC.

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:29.560
IF IT WORKS,
THE WHOLE THING

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.600
IS GOING TO BE
LIKE A TROJAN HORSE.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.600
LOOKS LIKE A SUGAR, BUT INSIDE
IT'S A LETHAL WEAPON.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.430
Forman: MARK RECOGNIZED
IT WAS A CHEMISTRY PROBLEM.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:40.630
HE SAW THE CHEMISTRY
OF THE DRUG.

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:45.600
HE KNEW THE CHEMISTRY
OF THE POLYMER.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.430
HIS INSIGHT WAS
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:49.360
TO PUT THOSE TWO THINGS
TOGETHER IN A WAY

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.330
THAT NOBODY HAD THOUGHT
TO DO BEFORE.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:00.330
Mark: THE OBJECTIVE
OF PHASE-ONE TRIAL

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:02.230
IS ALL ABOUT SAFETY.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:05.730
BUT IN TODAY'S WORLD,

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:07.330
YOU'RE DOING
EVERYTHING YOU CAN

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:10.400
TO SEE IF, IN FACT,
YOU'RE HAVING EFFICACY.

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:14.830
IF WE DON'T SEE INDICATIONS
THAT THIS THING

00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:16.860
IS GOING TO WORK IN A PHASE-ONE,
EVERYONE WOULD KIND OF GO,

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:20.360
"WHY GO TO A PHASE-TWO?"

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.460
SO IT WOULD BE ALL OVER.

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.130
10 YEARS AND OUT.

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:32.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:34.260
I HAVE TO THINK FORWARD.

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.060
HE'S ALWAYS
THINKING POSITIVE.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:38.760
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
TO FIND OUT

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.730
FROM THE RESULTS
TOMORROW?

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:43.430
TOMORROW, MAINLY TO SEE
IF IT'S IMPROVED,

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:48.000
THE CANCER, IS TREATING IT
OR IS STABLE.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.160
THE LAST RESULT,
IT WAS STABLE.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.700
I WANT TO SEE IT
STILL STABLE

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:57.260
OR IT'S ACTUALLY
TREATING THE CANCER.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.100
THE C.T. SCAN SHOWS
ALL THAT, RIGHT?

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.660
YEAH.

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.230
YOU SAW ME LAST YEAR.
YOU SAW ME A YEAR BEFORE.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:04.900
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:06.260
A BIG IMPROVEMENT.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.460
YOU LOOK
MUCH HEALTHIER.

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:12.930
YEAH? SHE'S THE GIRL
THAT WORRIES TOO MUCH FOR ME.

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:15.230
IT'S HARD BEING ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD.

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:17.400
TOMORROW,
I WANT YOU TO MEET

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.400
A VERY INTERESTING PERSON, OK?
HIS NAME IS DR. MARK DAVIS.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.130
HE WORKS FOR THE CALTECH.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:24.900
I'VE TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.730
HIS WIFE HAD BREAST CANCER,
AND SHE WAS TAKING CHEMO,

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:30.460
AND SHE SAID, "NO, IT HAS TO
BE BETTER THAN THIS."

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:32.730
SHE ENCOURAGED HIM TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:35.000
AND HE DID IT.
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.530
I RESPECT HER
AND HIM SO MUCH.

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:41.100
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
EVERYBODY LIVES AND DIES,

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:46.200
BUT SOME PEOPLE LEAVE
AN IMPRESSION FOR GENERATIONS.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.260
YOU KNOW, THEY'LL NEVER
BE FORGOTTEN.

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:52.160
AND THIS IS
ONE OF THE STORIES.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:07.460
Mark: THERE'S ALWAYS REASON
TO QUESTION YOURSELF.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:12.060
YOU KNOW, YOU TAKE IT
ONE STEP AT A TIME.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:15.500
YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO JUST
STAY CALM, RUN THE COURSE,

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:20.130
IN HOPES THAT, YOU KNOW,
WE CAN DO BETTER.

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:23.330
Ray: I FINISHED
THE SIXTH MONTH.

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:26.700
IT'S AN IMPORTANT DAY.

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:30.900
Lisa: GOT BUTTERFLIES.

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.830
I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT
CALLING MY SIBLINGS

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:36.600
TO LET THEM KNOW
THE RESULTS AND...

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:40.260
YOU UNDERSTAND, LISA,
THAT THIS IS ONLY RESEARCH?

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.100
OK?

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.930
SO NOTHING FOOLPROOF.

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:46.130
YEAH, I KNOW.
I KNOW.

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:48.260
SO BE PREPARED
FOR ANY NEWS, OK?

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:50.860
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE
THE BAD WITH THE GOOD.

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:52.660
YEAH, I KNOW.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.400
CITY OF HOPE.

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.960
HI, RAY.
HOW ARE YOU?

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.900
HI, DOC.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.060
YOU KNOW MY WIFE.
YOU KNOW MY DAUGHTER?

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.230
THAT YOUR DAUGHTER
FROM NEW ZEALAND?

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:19.730
GLAD TO MEET YOU.

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:21.900
TODAY, AS YOU KNOW,

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.460
YOU FINISH 6 MONTHS
OF THE TREATMENT,

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:29.300
AND I WOULD LIKE TO
SHOW YOU THE RESULTS.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.500
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT
IN PARTICULAR

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.160
IS YOUR LUNG LESION.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.830
YOU SEE THESE DOTS?

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:36.360
YES.

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.100
THESE MULTIPLE DOTS,
BOTH SIDES OF THE LUNG,

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:41.260
AS YOU KNOW BEFORE,
AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH,

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.160
TO SHOW YOU
SEVERAL THINGS.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:46.100
FIRST, THERE'S NOT
ANY NEW LESION COME OUT,

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.700
WHICH IS GOOD.

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.360
THAT'S VERY GOOD,
YEAH.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.930
YEAH. AND THE SECOND THING IS
THAT THEY'RE ALL VERY STABLE.

00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:54.700
NONE OF THEM SHOW
ANY ENLARGEMENT AT ALL.

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:56.200
THAT'S ALSO GOOD.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:02.730
THE THIRD THING IS, THERE'S
SOME LESION HAS BEEN CAVITATED.

00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:05.460
THAT MEANS
THEY'RE LIKE A HOLE NOW.

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:07.730
SO THIS USED TO BE
A TUMOR MASS

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:09.300
AS A SOLID TUMOR MASS.

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.560
NOW THE INSIDE
BECOMES A HOLE.

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:14.660
SAME THING HERE.

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:17.530
THAT USUALLY MEANS THAT THE
INSIDE OF THE TUMOR IS DYING.

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:20.030
SO THAT IS
A VERY GOOD SIGN FOR US.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:22.560
Ray: WHEN I JOINED
THE STUDY,

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.400
I HAD TUMORS
ALL OVER MY LUNGS.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.260
BOTH LUNGS WERE COMPLETELY
COVERED WITH HUNDREDS OF TUMORS.

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:31.700
RIGHT NOW, MOST OF THE TUMORS
ARE HEALING.

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:36.860
THE REST OF THEM
IS DORMANT, HAS STOPPED DEAD.

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:41.360
EXCELLENT. THAT'S REALLY
EXCELLENT RESULTS HERE. YEAH.

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.060
I'M HAPPY
WITH THAT, TOO.

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.960
YEAH, WE ARE
HAPPY FOR YOU.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.160
THANKS.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.200
THAT'S VERY GOOD RESULT.

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.100
WOULDN'T HOPE FOR
ANY BETTER THAN THIS

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:53.400
AT THIS STAGE
IN 6 MONTHS.

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.760
AH. IS THAT GOOD
NEWS OR WHAT?

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.460
SEE? I TOLD YOU.

00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:59.860
TIME TO CELEBRATE,
RIGHT?

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.260
NOW YOU CAN
CALL, OK?

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:07.460
LUCKY. YEAH?

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.300
STOP IT.

00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:26.060
HI, EVERYBODY.

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:27.560
HI.

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:29.160
HEY,
HOW ARE YOU?

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:31.830
HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:33.660
YOU KNOW MY WIFE.

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:36.330
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER
FROM NEW ZEALAND.

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:37.830
DID YOU SEE
THE CHANGE

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:39.600
FROM LAST TIME
TILL NOW?

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.330
STILL SMILING.
THAT'S GREAT.

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:43.000
I GOT UP A LOT
OF WEIGHT NOW.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.500
OH, MORE WEIGHT?

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.730
WHEN I CAME HERE,
WHEN YOU MET ME,

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:48.430
I WAS TIRED,
I COULDN'T WORK.

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:49.830
RIGHT NOW,
IT'S ALL THAT GONE.

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:52.000
SO I'VE BEEN LIVING
A VERY ACTIVE LIFE

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.830
FOR THE LAST
4 OR 5 MONTHS.

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:55.830
YOUR HARD WORK
WASN'T FOR NOTHING.

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:57.630
NO. NOT AT ALL.

00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:59.830
YEAH. HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THIS RESULT?

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:01.830
I FEEL GREAT NOW,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:04.660
NOT ONLY YOU, BUT THERE
ARE MANY OTHER PEOPLE

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.100
NOW ON THIS.

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:07.630
WE'RE GETTING A LOT
OF EXPERIENCE NOW WITH IT

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:10.500
AND SO FORTH, SO WE'RE ALL
PRETTY HAPPY ABOUT IT.

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:12.500
YEAH. A THOUSAND
SHARES ARE MINE.

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:19.960
1,000 SHARES IS MINE
IN THIS COMPANY.

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:23.600
HE'S A BUSINESS GUY.

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:25.260
IF I'M GOING TO
LIVE LONGER,

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:28.630
I'M GOING TO NEED
MONEY, OK?

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:30.730
LISTEN,
KEEP IT UP, OK?

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:32.160
REALLY GREAT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.160
VERY NICE TO SEE YOU.
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.630
AND SAY HI
TO YOUR WIFE, TOO.

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:37.030
BECAUSE SOMETHING
HAPPENED GOOD.

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:38.760
OK? DON'T
FORGET THAT.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.260
ALL RIGHT. GREAT.

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:42.100
OK.

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:45.530
AMAZING THAT ONE MINUTE,
I WAS LOOKING AT MY OWN DEMISE,

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:48.430
AND NOW I'M SITTING HERE,
AND I KNOW NOW

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:50.900
THAT I DO HAVE
TIME ON MY HAND,

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:56.000
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SEE YOUR
DEATH RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.600
YOU OK?

00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.760
OK.

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.800
Yen: BEFORE THE START
OF THE TREATMENT,

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:05.560
THE LIFE EXPECTANCY
IS ABOUT 3 MONTHS OR EVEN LESS.

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.400
NOW WITH THIS KIND
OF RESULTS,

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:12.830
WE PREDICT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE
A MUCH LONGER LIFE EXPECTANCY,

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:18.860
AND WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO SEE
HE'S GETTING GOOD RESPONSE.

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:22.730
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATION
AND LAUGHTER]

00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:26.200
WHAT KIND OF WOMAN
WANTS TO MARRY THIS GUY?

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.930
LET'S GO AHEAD AND BOOK
TICKETS FOR ALASKA.

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:31.330
HOW MANY FAMILIES ARE GOING?
15 SO FAR?

00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:33.860
Mark: MY PERSONAL HOPE
FOR RAY IS THAT, YOU KNOW,

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:35.330
ULTIMATELY HIS TUMORS
WOULD GO AWAY,

00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:40.000
BUT I MEAN, THAT'S ASKING
A HUGE, HUGE AMOUNT.

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:44.930
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M GREEDY.
I WANT TO GO FOR EVERYTHING.

00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:53.260
I AM A SPRINTER,
NOT A LONG-DISTANCE RUNNER,

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:55.330
AND SO THIS IS NOT
A FAST RACE.

00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:59.560
THIS HAS BEEN A 10-YEAR,
DRAWN-OUT PROCESS

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.660
TO GET JUST
WHERE WE'RE AT,

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.560
AND WE STILL HAVE
MANY YEARS TO GO

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.000
BEFORE WE WOULD CONSIDER

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.030
WE'RE ANYWHERE NEAR
THE END OF THE ROAD.

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:12.400
Mary: I GUESS MARK HAS ALWAYS
SOLVED A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:16.660
YOU JUST...YOU MENTION
EVEN CASUALLY SOMETHING,

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:20.900
LIKE, TURN TO YOUR HUSBAND
AND SAY, "GO CURE CANCER."

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:24.400
YOU KNOW, AND HE WENT
AND IS DOING IT.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:29.560
WHEN I ASKED MARK THIS,
I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF IT

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:32.030
AS, LIKE, A LOVE STORY,

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:36.100
BECAUSE HE SAW ME
BEING SO SICK

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:41.830
AND HE WANTED TO
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:43.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.530
TO THE HEALTH
AND PROSPERITY OF MR. RAY.

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:47.260
YES!

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:50.360
TO SEE IT GOING INTO A PATIENT
AND ACTUALLY WORKING,

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:52.200
IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE.

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:53.760
SEE THAT?

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.400
Ray: THIS IS THE VERY FIRST DAY.
I WAS THE FIRST HUMAN.

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:59.130
AND FROM A SELFISH
POINT OF VIEW,

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:02.900
I THINK, OK,
IF MY DAUGHTER GETS SICK,

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.060
I HAVE A DRUG
THAT MY HUSBAND DEVELOPED

00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.560
TO GIVE TO HER.

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.460
STILL CURIOUS?
