00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.800
BIOTECHNOLOGY: THE USE
OF BIOLOGICAL ORGANISMS

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.960
AND PROCESSES TO
PROVIDE USEFUL PRODUCTS

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.200
IN INDUSTRY
AND MEDICINE.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.660
IT HAS BEGUN TO AFFECT
SO MANY ASPECTS

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.100
OF OUR 21ST
CENTURY LIVES.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.530
BIOTECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS
CAN BE SEEN IN AGRICULTURE,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.430
PHARMACEUTICAL DEVELOPMENT,
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING,

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.130
AND EVEN THE
HUMAN GENOME.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.930
THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY
EXPANDS AND GROWS EACH DAY.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.500
BUT WHAT EXACTLY
IS BIOTECHNOLOGY?

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.060
HOW DOES IT AFFECT
EVERYDAY LIFE?

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.000
WHERE WILL IT TAKE
US IN THE FUTURE?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.530
BIOTECHNOLOGY IN THE 21ST
CENTURY WILL HELP DE-MYSTIFY

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.160
THIS SEEMINGLY LIMITLESS AND
VITAL SCIENCE BY PROVIDING

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.530
CONCRETE ANSWERS TO
THESE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.230
LIFE ON PLANET EARTH
ALL STARTED WITH A BANG.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.960
FROM A SINGLE POINT
OF COMPRESSED MATTER

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.730
TO THE VAST AND INFINITE
DEPTHS OF SPACE AND TIME,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.060
MILLIONS OF YEARS OF
EVOLUTION AND GROWTH

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.400
HAVE LED SCIENTISTS
TO THE DISCOVERY

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.200
OF THE BASIS OF
ALL LIFE: THE CELL.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.760
BUT IT IS INSIDE
THE CELL ITSELF

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.930
WHERE THE TRULY
REMARKABLE THINGS HAPPEN.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.100
IN ORDER TO
UNDERSTAND THE GENOME

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.600
WE MUST FIRST
UNDERSTAND DNA.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.460
SHORTHAND FOR
DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.430
DNA IS WHAT
SCIENTISTS CALL

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.360
THE BUILDING
BLOCKS OF ALL LIFE.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.560
INSIDE EACH CELL OF AN
ORGANISM IS THE NUCLEUS,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.160
AND THE NUCLEUS CONTAINS THE
CELL'S CHROMOSOMES AND DNA.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.730
DNA IS A LONG, STRING-LIKE
MOLECULE THAT HOLDS A SIMPLE

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.630
BUT IMPORTANT INFORMATIONAL
CODE USED TO DIRECT THE CELL

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.530
TO PERFORM
CERTAIN FUNCTIONS.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.800
WE'VE KNOWN FOR OVER
A HUNDRED YEARS NOW

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.160
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING
INSIDE THE NUCLEUS,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.660
OR THE CENTER, OF EVERY
CELL IN THE HUMAN BODY

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.700
AND OTHER CELLS IN
OTHER ORGANISMS,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.700
EVEN BACTERIA,
THAT CODES FOR LIFE.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.200
THE IDEA OF DNA,
DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.460
HAS BEEN AROUND NOW FOR
SOME 50 OR 60 OR 70 YEARS.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.960
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
YOU AND ME IS ACTUALLY

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.160
A SMALL NUMBER, A RELATIVELY
SMALL NUMBER OF BASES

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:06.630
WITHIN THAT STRAND OF
DNA THAT WE BOTH CARRY.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.760
ALL OF OUR CELLS HAVE THE
SAME, OR MOSTLY THE SAME,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.260
DNA, BUT BETWEEN
TWO INDIVIDUALS

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.230
THERE'S A REMARKABLY SMALL
NUMBER OF DIFFERENCES.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.930
A GENOME IS THE ENTIRE DNA IN AN
ORGANISM, INCLUDING ITS GENES.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.960
GENES CARRY INFORMATION
FOR MAKING ALL THE PROTEINS

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.600
REQUIRED BY
THE ORGANISM.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.900
THESE PROTEINS DETERMINE
HOW THE ORGANISM WILL LOOK,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.130
HOW WELL ITS BODY METABOLIZES
FOOD OR FIGHTS INFECTION,

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.400
AND SOMETIMES
EVEN HOW IT BEHAVES.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.930
THE GENOME IS
ESSENTIALLY THE SEQUENCE

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.300
OF ALL THE DNA OF A
SPECIES, LIKE HUMANS,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.660
AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE
GENES WITHIN THAT SEQUENCE.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.130
DOGS AND CATS AND
RATS ALL HAVE GENOMES.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.730
THAT'S THAT STRING OF DNA THAT
MAKES UP ALL THE CHROMOSOMES

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.200
IN THE NUCLEUS
OF ALL OUR CELLS.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.130
IT CODES FOR WHO WE ARE, WHAT WE
ARE, HAS ALL THE INFORMATION

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.930
FROM THE PAST ABOUT OUR
PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS,

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.800
AND IT'S REALLY THE SECRET
TO CODING FOR THE PROTEINS,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.200
CODING FOR THE MACHINERY
THAT CREATE THE CELLS

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.560
AND THE TISSUES AND THE
ORGANS THAT LIFE EMERGES FROM.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.600
GENOMES ARE A REALLY
SIMPLE CONCEPT.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.030
IT'S THE SETS OF CHROMOSOMES
IN THE NUCLEUS OF YOUR CELLS.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.760
YOU RECEIVED ONE SET OF
CHROMOSOMES FROM YOUR MOTHER,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.430
ONE SET FROM YOUR FATHER,
SO IT'S THE CONSTITUENT

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.100
BOTH SETS THAT
COMPRISE THE GENOME.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.430
THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY
SUGGESTS THAT THE TERM "GENOME"

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.100
MAY BE A COMBINATION OF THE
WORDS "GENE" AND "CHROMOSOME".

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.800
BUT SCIENTISTS NOW KNOW THAT THE
GENOME IS MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.030
HOW GENOMICS STARTED
AS A FIELD OF SCIENCE

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.600
IS RELATED TO THE CREATION
OF A BIOTECHNOLOGY

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.930
INDUSTRY CAPABILITY
CALLED DNA SEQUENCING.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.000
THAT CAPABILITY TO MEASURE THE
GENOME, TO SEQUENCE THE DNA,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.130
IS CALLED "GENOMICS".

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.200
GENOMICS IS THE
STUDY OF THE GENOME.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.160
SO IT IS UNDERSTANDING
CHROMOSOME STRUCTURE,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.100
IT'S UNDERSTANDING HOW GENES
ARE ALIGNED ON THE CHROMOSOME,

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.430
HOW THE CHROMOSOME FIBERS
ARE PACKED AROUND PROTEINS,

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.430
HOW ALL OF THE BIOLOGY
SURROUNDING THE GENETIC

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.730
MATERIAL IN THE NUCLEUS
OF YOUR CELLS BEHAVES,

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.900
AND FROM A
BIOLOGICAL SENSE.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.100
IN 1990, THE ADVANCEMENTS IN
GENOMICS AND THE STUDY OF GENES

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.300
LED SCIENTISTS TO ONE
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.160
RESEARCH ENDEAVORS
IN HISTORY:

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.530
THE HUMAN GENOME PROJECT IS
BASICALLY A LARGE CATALOGING

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.100
OF ALL THE DNA SEQUENCE
OF A HUMAN BEING.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.260
BASICALLY LOOKING AT
ALL THE CHROMOSOMES,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.530
SEQUENCING THEM AND
THEN MAKING AN INDEX.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.000
EVERY GENE IN YOUR BODY
THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.400
HOW TALL YOU ARE,
HOW FAST YOU RUN,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.600
WHAT COLOR YOUR NAILS ARE,
HOW FAST YOUR HEART BEATS,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.500
EVERY GENE THAT'S
RESPONSIBLE FOR A FUNCTION

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.230
WAS IDENTIFIED
IN THIS PROJECT.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.830
BY FIRST SEQUENCING
AN AVERAGE PERSON

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.930
AND THEN GOING THROUGH AND
BEING ABLE TO FIND GENES

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.030
IN THAT AVERAGE PERSON
WE CAN BEGIN TO STUDY

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.430
THEIR EFFECT AND THEIR
PURPOSE IN THE BODY.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.460
BY IDENTIFYING, OR SEQUENCING,
EACH HUMAN GENOME,

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.860
SCIENTISTS HOPE TO
TAKE AN IN-DEPTH LOOK

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.930
AT THE FUNCTION
OF THE GENES.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.360
STUDYING DIFFERENCES OR
MUTATIONS WITHIN THE GENES,

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.960
THEY REVEAL THE CAUSES
OF DISEASES LIKE CANCER

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.530
AND AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT
OF POTENTIAL TREATMENTS.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.830
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOU AND
ME - MY GENETICS, MY INHERITANCE

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.430
OF GENES IS DIFFERENT FROM YOURS
AS WELL, AND THAT CERTAINLY

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.560
DOES PREDISPOSE ME FOR
CERTAIN DISEASES MORE THAN YOU

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.260
AND YOU FOR CERTAIN
DISEASES MORE THAN ME.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.360
AND ONCE WE FIND THOSE
DIFFERENCES - AND IT SOUNDS

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.330
LIKE A SIMPLE PROCESS BUT
IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ONE

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.300
- ONCE WE FIND
THOSE DIFFERENCES

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.430
WE CAN START ASKING
QUESTIONS LIKE "WHY?"

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.760
WHY DO THOSE DIFFERENCES
MAKE A DIFFERENCE

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.230
IN TERMS OF
DEVELOPMENT OF CANCER?

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:28.600
NOW THAT WE HAVE A BASE LINE
OF WHAT THE GENOME LOOKS LIKE,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.260
IT'S MUCH EASIER TO LOOK AT
DISEASE STATES, SAY CANCER,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.360
AND FIND OUT IF THERE HAVE BEEN
BREAKS IN PARTS OF THE GENOMES

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.030
AND THE PIECES WERE PUT BACK
TOGETHER IN A MIXED UP SENSE.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.000
SO YOU CAN SEE KIND OF
WHAT THE UNDERLYING REASONS

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.360
THAT SOME OF THESE
CANCERS ARE OCCURRING.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.600
IT HELPS US UNDERSTAND
DOWNSTREAM WHERE THE

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.660
PROTEIN'S MALFUNCTIONING,
WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.760
SO THE HOPE WAS THAT IF
WE DEFINED WHAT GENES

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.530
WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT
FUNCTIONS WE COULD THEN

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.500
EASILY IDENTIFY WHEN
SOMETHING WAS AWRY.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:12.960
SO IF A NORMAL PERSON WHO WAS
NOT PREDISPOSED TO ANY DISEASES

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.360
THAT WE KNOW OF, SUCH AS
DIABETES, IF THAT PERSON'S

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.630
GENOME WAS COMPARED WITH A
PERSON WHO WAS PREDISPOSED

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.530
TO AN INHERITABLE DISEASE,
THEN WE COULD IDENTIFY

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.100
WHAT PART OF THE GENE
WAS ABERRANT OR NOT

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.630
FUNCTIONING PROPERLY AND
THEN TREAT THOSE DISEASES.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.900
AND IT GOES BEYOND
CANCER TO OTHER DISEASES.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.500
DIABETES IS AN AREA THAT'S
VERY ACTIVE IN LOOKING AT WHAT

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.700
CAUSES DIABETES - PARTICULARLY
THINGS LIKE JUVENILE ONSET

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.830
WHICH IS A
GENETIC DISEASE.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.530
BUT WHEN WE REALLY LOOK
IN MICROSCOPIC DETAIL

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.360
AT THE DNA TO UNDERSTAND
THE GENES WE FIND OUT

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.230
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF
VARIATION IN THE GENES

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.230
HAVING TO DO WITH MUTATIONS,
HAVING TO DO WITH SPLICING

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.260
OF THE GENES TO ONE ANOTHER
AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.460
COPYING OF THE GENES AND
DIFFERENT KINDS OF IMPRINTING

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.930
FROM THE ENVIRONMENT
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.500
THAT THE COMPLEXITY OF
UNDERSTANDING THE GENOME

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.330
IS SIGNIFICANT, BUT THE REWARDS
OF STUDYING THE GENOME

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.360
TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE
DIVERSITY AND ITS COMPLEXITY

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.430
CAN BENEFIT SOCIETY
IN UNDERSTANDING

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.300
HEALTH AND DISEASE.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.560
IT'S REALLY ENDLESS WHAT
WE CAN DO WITH GENOMICS

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.300
IF WE STUDY IT
APPROPRIATELY.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.600
ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING
DEVELOPMENTS TO COME FROM

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.130
THE STUDY OF HUMAN GENES
AND PROTEINS HAS BEEN

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.560
THE IDENTIFICATION OF
POTENTIAL NEW DRUGS

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.700
FOR THE TREATMENT
OF DISEASE.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.830
PROTEOMICS IS THE STUDY
OF PROTEIN EXPRESSION

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.300
AS IT RELATES TO HUMAN
DISEASES AND NORMAL FUNCTION.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.600
MANY HAVE PROPOSED THAT BY
STUDYING THE HUMAN GENOME

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.600
AND THE EXPRESSION
OF THOSE GENES

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.800
WE CAN AFFECT
HUMAN DISEASE.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.260
PROTEOMICS IS
SIMILAR TO GENOMICS.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.030
YOU MIGHT NOTICE THAT
THERE'S THIS "OMICS"

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.460
AT THE END OF GENOMICS
AND PROTEOMICS.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.460
GENOMICS
MEASURES THE GENES.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.860
PROTEOMICS MEASURES
THE PROTEINS

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.300
AND BY USING
PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.660
WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW
THE PROTEINS ARE CHANGED

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.400
AND MODIFIED AND LINKED
TOGETHER AND INTERACT

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.300
SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE
BASIC MACHINERY OF A CELL.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.700
SO PROTEOMICS AND GENOMICS ARE
REALLY QUITE LINKED TOGETHER.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.100
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND
PROTEINS BETTER,

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.760
LET'S TAKE ANOTHER
LOOK AT OUR DNA STRAND.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.360
DNA CONTAINS INFORMATION TO
MAKE EVERY PART OF OUR BODIES.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.100
EACH OF OUR THOUSANDS OF GENES
CODES FOR A SPECIFIC PART.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.330
RNA, A TYPE OF NUCLEIC
ACID, WORKS TO TRANSFER

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.030
THE INFORMATION USED
TO BUILD PROTEINS.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:57.330
BUT WHILE DNA STAYS INSIDE THE
NUCLEUS, A TYPE OF RNA CALLED

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.500
"MESSENGER RNA" COPIES THE
INFORMATION IN THE GENE

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.130
AND TRAVELS OUT
TO THE CYTOPLASM.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.460
THERE, A PROTEIN MAKING
MACHINE CALLED A "RIBOSOME"

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.030
WILL READ THE RNA TO
MAKE A PARTICULAR PROTEIN.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.330
PART OF THE RNA MOLECULE
CODES FOR AN AMINO ACID.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.700
PROTEINS ARE MADE
FROM AMINO ACIDS.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.760
ONCE THE AMINO ACIDS ARE
COMBINED IN A SPECIFIC WAY

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.700
WITH THE LANGUAGE OF DNA
AND RNA, A PROTEIN IS CREATED.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.130
SOME PROTEINS FORM STRUCTURES
LIKE TEETH, HAIR, AND SKIN.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:33.960
OTHERS CAN CREATE SENSES BY
BEING CODED TO READ LIGHT,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.700
SOUND, OR FLAVOR.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.860
WE STUDY HOW THOSE
PROTEINS ARE MANUFACTURED

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.760
AND SECRETED AND THE
FUNCTIONS THAT THEY

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.760
PROMOTE WITHIN
AND WITHOUT THE CELL.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.930
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PROTEINS,
THOSE ARE THE THINGS

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.060
WHICH OUR
BODIES RUN ON.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.500
THAT'S THE CHEMISTRY
THAT MAKES US HAPPEN

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.600
IS PROTEIN-PROTEIN
INTERACTIONS.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.000
WE ARE NOTHING OTHER
THAN PROTEIN INTERACTIONS.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.200
SO IN PROTEOMICS THERE ARE
VASTLY COMPLEX WAYS THAT WE

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.800
MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF A NUMBER
OF PROTEINS PRESENT IN THE BODY.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.200
PROTEOMICS CAN ANALYZE WHAT
MAKES EACH HUMAN'S GENES

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.100
DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER
ON A CELLULAR LEVEL.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.030
THESE DIFFERENCES, CALLED
"SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.030
POLYMORPHISMS" ARE WHAT
SCIENTISTS ARE NOW STUDYING

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:27.530
IN ORDER TO BETTER
UNDERSTAND DISEASE.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.700
SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE
POLYMORPHISMS ARE

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.160
SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE
CHANGES IN THE GENOME,

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.230
AND WHEN YOU ANALYZE
USING VERY SOPHISTICATED

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:43.260
TECHNIQUES YOU CAN IDENTIFY
"SNIPS" - SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.860
POLYMORPHISMS ARE ALSO CALLED
"SNIPS"; IT'S EASIER TO SAY.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.930
IN CANCER SNIPS HAVE BEEN
UTILIZED TO START TO DEVELOP

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.530
NONPROTEIN BASED
BIOMARKERS TO WHAT

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:58.100
PARTICULAR TYPE OF DISEASE
CANCER YOU HAVE, WHETHER

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.260
YOU'LL BE SUSCEPTIBLE
TO CERTAIN TREATMENTS.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.800
ONE OF THE UNTOLD STORIES
IN HUMAN HEALTH IS THAT

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.360
OUR CELLS KNOW WHEN
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DIE.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.030
WELL, IF THEY LOSE THIS ABILITY,
WHICH IS POSSIBLE WITH THE

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:15.400
SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE
POLYMORPHISM, YOU HAVE CANCER.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:22.130
FOR MANY YEARS THERE'S BEEN AN
UNDERSTANDING THAT CANCERS BEGIN

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:27.230
OFTENTIMES BECAUSE THERE'S
A MUTATION IN A SIGNIFICANT

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:32.660
CONTROL PROTEIN THAT
RESULTS IN ALTERED CELL GROWTH

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.800
AND OFTENTIMES IT IS AN
UNCONTROLLED CELL GROWTH.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.930
MOST OF THE TIME WE HAVE
PROCESSES WITHIN THE CELL

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.160
THAT ARE SELF-CHECKING AND
CAUSE THE CELL TO GO THROUGH

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.160
PROCESSES OF CELL DEATH AND
MOST CANCERS GO UNDETECTED

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.130
BECAUSE THEY ARISE AND
THE CHECKS AND BALANCES

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:54.800
IN OUR CELLS NATURALLY CAUSE
THE CANCEROUS CELL TO DIE.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.000
OCCASIONALLY YOU GET A
MUTATION THAT GOES UNDETECTED

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.530
AND STARTS TO GROW.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.060
THEN YOU GET AN ACCUMULATION
OF MUTATIONS IN A CELL

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.100
AND THE CANCER BECOMES
EVEN MORE DIFFICULT.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.500
AS THE LATEST APPLICATIONS
OF PROTEOMICS AND GENOMICS

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.030
BEGIN TO EMERGE, IT SEEMS AS
THOUGH A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.760
IN DISEASE TREATMENT COULD
BE JUST BEYOND THE HORIZON.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.200
GENOMICS AND PROTEOMICS
HOLD A GREAT DEAL OF POTENTIAL

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.130
AND HAVE ALREADY
HELPED US UNDERSTAND

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.060
IN FUNDAMENTALLY NEW
WAYS MANY DISEASES.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:32.560
IN CANCER, FOR EXAMPLE, GENOMIC
AND BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSIS

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.500
HAVE HELPED US TO IDENTIFY
GENES THAT ARE DIRECTLY

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.300
RELATED TO THE CAUSE OF
CANCER, LIKE THE B53 GENE

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:45.960
OR THE BRCA GENES FOR
BREAST CANCER AND OTHERS.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.730
THESE ARE THINGS WE'VE STARTED
TO RESEARCH AND UNDERSTAND

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.560
BY USING BIOINFORMATICS IN
COLLABORATION WITH GENOMICS

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:58.530
AND GENETICS WHICH IS LOOKING
FOR DIFFERENCES AND MUTATIONS

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:03.300
BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND TRY
TO PIECE THEM TOGETHER TO

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.100
CONSTRUCT THE WHOLE STORY OF
WHAT'S CAUSING THESE CANCERS.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.300
FROM THAT EVENTUALLY
WE MAY BE ABLE TO ALTER

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.430
OR FIX THE MUTATIONS
THAT ARE CAUSING THESE

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.360
IN ORDER TO PREVENT
THE ONSET OF CANCER.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.660
BUT AT A MINIMUM RIGHT NOW IF
WE KNOW SOMEBODY'S PREDISPOSED

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.500
- WHETHER THEY SHOW IT IN
THEIR FAMILY HISTORY OR NOT -

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.600
THEY KNOW THEY'RE PREDISPOSED
FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCER,

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.800
THAT MAY SUGGEST
CERTAIN LIFESTYLE CHANGES

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.030
THEY MAY
WANT TO TAKE.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.500
TYPE 2 DIABETES WAS JUST
AN EPIDEMIC IN THIS COUNTRY

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.760
WITH MORE THAN 30
MILLION PEOPLE SUFFERING.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.030
SO WHAT THE GOAL OFTEN IS, IS TO
UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEX DISEASE,

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:45.430
UNDERSTAND THE GENETICS, USE
PROTEOMICS TO FIND THE MARKERS

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:51.800
BUT HAVE THAT INFORMATION
PROVIDE US, FRANKLY, INFORMATION

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.000
ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF THE
DISEASE, HOW IT FITS IN WITH OUR

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.030
FAMILY AND WHERE WE CAME FROM,
AND GIVES US A WAY TO WORK

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:09.260
TO PREVENT, WORK TO INTERVENE
EARLY, AND WORK TO REVERSE

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:16.260
THE LONG-TERM CHRONIC DISEASE
PROCESS THAT OFTEN FACES US.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.530
WE KNOW HOW
TO KILL A CELL.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.700
WHETHER IT'S A CANCEROUS
CELL OR A NORMAL CELL,

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.660
WE PRETTY MUCH
KNOW HOW TO KILL IT.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.030
THE QUESTION IS CAN WE
KILL IT WITHOUT KILLING

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.030
ALL THE CELLS
THAT SURROUND IT?

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:31.060
SO AS WE DEVELOP SMARTER
DRUGS AND USE NANOTECHNOLOGY

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.030
AND BIOTECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS
TO DO THAT, WE CAN TREAT,

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.930
HOPEFULLY, ANY CANCER
AT ANY STAGE IN ANY BODY.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:42.100
THAT WOULD BE A
REAL NICE THING.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.360
ONCE THE RESEARCH IS
COMPLETE, WHAT'S NEXT?

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.200
WHAT DO RESEARCHERS DO WITH
ALL THIS NEW INFORMATION?

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.400
ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES
IN PROTEOMICS AND GENOMICS

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.860
AND ALL THE OTHER SCIENCES
THAT END WITH "OMICS"

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.200
HAS TO DO WITH THE ENORMOUS
AMOUNT OF DATA THAT'S CREATED.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.060
THE HUMAN GENOME, TO
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE,

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:06.060
HAS THREE AND A HALF
BILLION BASE PARENTS OF DNA.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.760
AND SO WHEN WE MEASURE
THAT WITH THE NEW SEQUENCING

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.000
DEVICES WE GET UP TO A
TERABYTE OR MORE OF DATA.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.630
A TERABYTE IS A
THOUSAND GIGABYTES.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:38.860
BIOINFORMATICS IS BASICALLY
BEING ABLE TO TAKE LARGE AMOUNTS

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:43.100
OF BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION,
WHETHER IT BE PROTEINS OR EVEN

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:47.300
LOOKING AT THE ECOLOGY, AND
BEING ABLE TO CATEGORIZE IT

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.160
AND SIFT THROUGH A LOT OF
THE DATA WITH COMPUTERS

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.100
AND COME UP WITH
COMMONALITIES.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.660
THE ONLY WAY IT CAN BE DONE IS
WITH A LOT OF COMPUTER POWER.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.400
IT'S TAPPING INTO THE DATA,
IT'S ANALYZING THAT DATA

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.230
WITH COMPUTERS, IT'S
RELATING THAT ANALYSIS

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.860
TO OTHER ANALYSES THAT
ARE DONE WITH COMPUTERS.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.400
THAT'S WHAT
BIOINFORMATICS IS ABOUT.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.600
IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU CAN'T
DO GENOMICS OR PROTEOMICS

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.030
WITHOUT THE BIOINFORMATICS
AND COMPUTING TO SUPPORT IT.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:20.030
TO PUT IT SIMPLY, BIOINFORMATICS
USES COMPUTERS TO SIFT THROUGH

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.960
MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF
SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.160
IT THEN CROSS REFERENCES ALL OF
THIS DATA IN HOPES OF FINDING

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.400
COMMONALITIES OR PATTERNS THAT
COULD SIGNIFY NEW DISCOVERIES.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.400
WE CAN USE BIOINFORMATICS TO
HELP US DETERMINE WHETHER

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.430
WE'RE SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARIOUS
CANCERS OR OTHER DISEASES,

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:38.960
AS AN EXAMPLE.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.030
IN SOCIETY AT LARGE WE
CAN USE BIOINFORMATICS

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.330
TO HELP THE POLICE FIGURE
OUT WHO DID A CRIME.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:49.960
WE CAN USE BIOINFORMATICS TO
HELP MEASURE THE HEALTH EFFECTS

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.560
OF EXHAUST COMING OUT
OF CARS ON THE FREEWAYS.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.360
ALL OF THIS CAN BE
INFORMED BY APPLYING

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.660
BIOINFORMATICS
ANALYSIS.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:03.460
A LOT OF CANCERS, ONCE
THEY'RE REMOVED SURGICALLY,

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.860
THE NEXT STEP IS TO
DECIDE WHAT NEXT?

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.500
DO WE WAIT
AND WATCH?

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:12.030
DO WE GIVE TREATMENT TO TRY AND
PREVENT A RECURRENCE OF CANCER?

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:15.630
THAT'S A MORE DIFFICULT QUESTION
THAN IT MIGHT APPEAR BECAUSE

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:19.360
A LOT OF CANCER TREATMENTS
ARE VERY DIRE, VERY DIFFICULT,

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.830
SO YOU HAVE THIS DIFFICULT
DECISION TO MAKE.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:25.300
SO THE TESTS WE'RE WORKING
ON FROM ANALYZING THIS DATA

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.100
ARE DESIGNED TO ADD
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.700
TO HELP MAKE
THESE DECISIONS.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.630
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IF I
WAS UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:40.560
TO HAVE LIVER CANCER, MY
CANCER WOULD BE UNIQUE TO ME

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.330
AND EACH PATIENT'S
WOULD BE UNIQUE TO THEM.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.630
HOWEVER, YOU CAN APPLY
THE TOOLS OF BIOINFORMATICS

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.500
TO EXAMINE EXPRESSION
OF MANY GENES ACROSS

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.030
ALL OF THE GENOME AND
COMPARE MULTIPLE PATIENTS

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.330
AND YOU BEGIN TO
GET INFORMATION

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.300
AND SO BIOINFORMATICS
IS REALLY CHANGING

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:04.060
THE WAY IN WHICH CANCERS
ARE BEING TREATED TODAY.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:09.700
WE KNOW THAT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
TENDS TO RUN IN FAMILIES...

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.200
AND SO MANY DISEASES
RUN IN FAMILIES.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.700
BUT IT JUST HASN'T TURNED
OUT TO BE THAT SIMPLE

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.760
TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE
GENES ARE PASSED THROUGH

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.560
AND WHAT THE EFFECT
OF THE ENVIRONMENT IS.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.500
AND BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSIS
AND GENOMICS AND PROTEOMICS

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.000
ANALYSIS ARE HELPING US TO
UNRAVEL WHAT'S GOING ON

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.960
IN THE PROGRESSION
OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.530
AND ALZHEIMER'S, LIKE MANY
DISEASES, LIKE DIABETES AND

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:38.730
OTHER DISEASES, ARE WHAT
WE CALL COMPLEX DISEASES.

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.530
THEY'RE NOT JUST
CAUSED BY ONE GENE,

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.630
THEY'RE CAUSED BY THE
COMBINATION OF MANY GENES

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.230
INTERACTING WITH
THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:50.960
AND SO WE ARE USING COMPUTERS
AND MODELING AND ANALYSIS

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.160
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE
CALL COMPLEX DISEASES

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.030
THAT HAVE MANY
GENETIC CONTRIBUTIONS.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.530
THE CRUCIAL ELEMENT
IS TO TAKE ALL THIS DATA

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.700
AND EXTRACT SOMETHING
FROM IT AND THAT'S WHAT

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.360
THE COMPUTATIONAL PART
OF BIOINFORMATICS IS.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.200
THAT'S WHY IT'S SUCH A
FASCINATING COMPUTER PROBLEM.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.400
TO TAKE THIS HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA
WHICH IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.960
AND EXTRACT THE KEY FEATURES
WITH IT AND THEN TO WORK WITH

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.660
THE SCIENTISTS TO SAY
HERE'S WHAT WE FOUND,

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.030
CAN WE PUT IT
IN A CONTEXT?

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.430
DOES THAT LEAD US
TO OTHER QUESTIONS?

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.860
EVERYBODY TRIES TO LOOK FOR
THEIR OWN ANSWER, BUT WITH A

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:32.260
COMPUTER IT'S PURELY NUMBERS,
IT'S PURELY ONES AND ZEROS

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.900
ONCE IT'S ALL PUT IN AND SIFTED
THROUGH AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.660
BIAS SO YOU CAN FIND UNKNOWN
CORRELATIONS THAT YOU WOULDN'T

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:44.260
HAVE THOUGHT TO LOOK FOR IF YOU
WERE JUST PUTTING PEN AND PENCIL

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.530
TO PAPER AND TRYING TO SIFT
THROUGH ALL THESE CHARTS.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.230
SO IT HAS THE POTENTIAL
TO UNLOCK QUITE A FEW

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:53.900
UNKNOWN PATHWAYS WE
HADN'T SEEN BEFORE.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:57.830
ACROSS THE GLOBE, SCIENTISTS,
DOCTORS, AND RESEARCHERS

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.460
HAVE DEDICATED THEIR PRACTICE
TO THE STUDY OF GENOMICS,

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.000
PROTEOMICS, AND
BIOINFORMATICS.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.060
THROUGH THEIR STUDIES WE ARE
ABLE TO SEE BEYOND THE LIMITS

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:10.500
OF OUR OWN PHYSICALITY TO THE
VERY STRUCTURE OF LIFE ITSELF.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.060
AND ONE DAY THEY MAY
MAKE THE DISCOVERY

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.700
THAT CHANGES
EVERYTHING.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.760
THE 20TH CENTURY WAS ALL ABOUT
PHYSICS AND THE NUCLEAR AGE.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.500
THE 21ST CENTURY IS ALL
ABOUT BIOLOGY, MEDICINE,

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:29.560
LIFE SCIENCES, BIOINFORMATICS,
GENOMICS, PROTEOMICS.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.430
WHETHER WE WILL EVER
HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO IN

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.530
AND FIX A GENE IS - I MEAN,
EVER IS A LONG TIME.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.600
I SUSPECT THE
ANSWER IS YES,

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.500
WE WILL EVER HAVE
THE ABILITY TO DO THAT.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.230
HOW SOON THAT IS,
IS THE QUESTION.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:46.400
IT'S AN INTERESTING FACT
THAT WHEN THE HUMAN GENOME

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.960
WAS SEQUENCED EVERYBODY
SAID, GREAT, SO TOMORROW

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.260
WE'LL HAVE NEW DRUGS TO
CURE ALL THESE DISEASES.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.830
AND THERE WAS THIS PERIOD WHERE
THEY SAID, WELL, WHERE ARE THEY?

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.360
WE'RE FIVE YEARS ON, TEN YEARS
ON, WHATEVER, WHERE ARE THEY?

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.300
BUT PEOPLE HAVE TO REMEMBER
IT TAKES TEN OR 20 YEARS

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.860
TO GO FROM THE CONCEPT
OF A POSSIBLE DRUG

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.700
TO A DRUG THAT CAN BE
SAFELY SOLD TO PEOPLE.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.730
AND SO WE ARE JUST NOW
CREEPING UP ON THAT TIMEFRAME

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:16.200
WHERE WE'LL START TO
SEE THE BENEFITS OF IT.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.430
IT'S AN EVER CHANGING FIELD
AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO EXCITING

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.800
ABOUT IT, THAT YOU'RE
FINDING OUT NEW THINGS.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.930
BEING A PHD, ONE OF THE
THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.060
IT'S MORE OF HOW
MUCH YOU DON'T KNOW.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.600
AND THAT'S THE ENORMITY OF IT
IS HOW MUCH WE DON'T KNOW

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.600
AND WE'RE ALL WORKING
TO UNDERSTAND EVEN MORE.
