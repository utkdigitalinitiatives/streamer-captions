00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.230


2
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.400
Will not King Richard let me speak with him?

3
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.870
No, my good lord.

4
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.770
Therefore, be patient.

5
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.930
Hastings and Edward's children,

6
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.430
Grey and Rivers, holy King Henry,

7
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.030
and thy fair son Edward, Vaughan,

8
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.100
and all that hath miscarried

9
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.730
by underhand, corrupted foul injustice,

10
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.000
if that your moody, discontented souls

11
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.870
do through the clouds behold this present hour,

12
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.400
even for revenge, mock my destruction.

13
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.930
This is All Souls' Day, fellow, is it not?

14
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.300
It is.

15
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.230
Why, then, All Souls' Day is my body's doomsday.

16
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.470
This is the day which in King Edward's time

17
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.070
I wished might fall on me

18
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.400
when I was found false to his children and his wife's allies.

19
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.730
This is the day wherein I wished to fall

20
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.070
by the false faith of him whom most I trusted.

21
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.100
This, this All Souls' Day

22
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.070
to my fearful soul is the determined respite of my wrongs.

23
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.400
That high All-Seer which I dallied with

24
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.200
hath turned my feigned prayer on my head

25
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.970
and given in earnest what I begged in jest.

26
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.800
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men

27
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.230
to turn their own points in their masters' bosoms.

28
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.930
Thus Margaret's curse falls heavy on my neck.

29
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.800
"When he," quoth she,

30
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:43.030
"shall split thy heart with sorrow,

31
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.030
remember Margaret was a prophetess."

32
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.370
Come, Ratcliffe.

33
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.630
Lead me to the block of shame.

34
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.270
Wrong hath but wrong

35
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.930
and blame the due of blame.

36
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.330
Fellows in arms and my most loving friends,

37
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.830
bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,

38
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.500
thus far into the bowels of the land

39
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.770
have we marched on without impediment.

40
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.430
And here receive we from our father, Stanley,

41
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.070
lines of fair comfort and encouragement.

42
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.000
The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar

43
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.330
that spoiled your summer fields and fruitful vines,

44
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.770
swills your warm blood like wash

45
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.700
and makes his trough in your emboweled bosoms--

46
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.100
this foul swine is now even in the center of this isle

47
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.830
near to the town of Leicester, as we learn.

48
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.770
From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.

49
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.900
In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,

50
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.800
to reap the harvest of perpetual peace

51
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.830
by this one bloody trial of sharp war.

52
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.270
Every man's conscience is a thousand men

53
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.400
to fight against this guilty homicide.

54
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.530
I doubt not but his friends will turn to us.

55
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.600
He hath no friends but what are friends for fear,

56
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.430
which in his dearest need will fly from him.

57
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.700
All for our vantage.

58
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.930
Then in God's name, march.

59
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.330
True hope is swift and flies with swallow's wings.

60
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.730
Kings it makes gods and meaner creatures kings.

61
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.030
Here pitch our tent, even here in Bosworth Field.

62
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.270
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?

63
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.770
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.

64
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:33.770
My Lord of Norfolk.

65
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.130
Here, most gracious liege.

66
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.130
Norfolk, we must have knocks. Huh, must we not?

67
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.130
We must both give and take, my loving lord.

68
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.930
Up with my tent!

69
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.430
Here will I lie tonight.

70
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.270
But where tomorrow?

71
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.770
Well, all's one for that.

72
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.600
Who hath descried the number of the traitors?

73
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.370
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.

74
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.600
Why, our battalion trebles that account.

75
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.970
Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength

76
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.400
which they upon the adverse faction want.

77
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:17.900
Up with the tent!

78
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.530
Come, noble gentlemen.

79
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.500
Let us survey the vantage of the ground.

80
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.700
Call for some men of sound direction.

81
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.630
Let's lack no discipline, make no delay.

82
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.130
For, lords, tomorrow is a busy day.

83
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:57.370
The weary sun hath made a golden set,

84
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.400
and by the bright track of his fiery car

85
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.570
gives token of a goodly day tomorrow.

86
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.270
Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.

87
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.970
Give me some ink and paper in my tent.

88
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.870
I'll draw the form and model of our battle.

89
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.230
Limit each leader to his several charge,

90
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.130
and part in just proportion our small power.

91
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.530
My Lord of Dorset, you, Sir William Brandon,

92
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.970
and you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.

93
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.130
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment.

94
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.500
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him,

95
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.600
and by the second hour in the morning,

96
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.230
desire the earl to see me in my tent.

97
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.030
Yet one thing more, good Captain, do for me.

98
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.900
Where is Lord Stanley quartered?

99
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.600
Do you know?

100
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.770
Unless I have mista'en his colors much,

101
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.570
which well I am assured I have not done,

102
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.570
his regiment lies half a mile at least

103
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.500
south from the mighty power of the king.

104
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.900
If without peril it be possible, sweet Blunt,

105
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.330
make some good means to speak with him,

106
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.470
and give him from me this most needful note.

107
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.900
Upon my life, my lord, I'll undertake it.

108
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.770
So God give you quiet rest tonight.

109
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.770
Good night, good Captain Blunt.

110
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.600
Come, gentlemen.

111
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.700
Let us consult upon tomorrow's business.

112
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.430
Into my tent.

113
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.670
The dew is raw and cold.

114
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.600
What is't o'clock?

115
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.230
It's suppertime, my lord.

116
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.600
It's nine o'clock.

117
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.200
I will not sup tonight.

118
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.670
Give me some ink and paper.

119
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.470
What, is my armor easier than it was?

120
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.300
It is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.

121
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.270
Good Norfolk.

122
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.500
Hie thee to thy charge.

123
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.470
Use careful watch. Choose trusty sentinels.

124
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:06.700
I go, my lord.

125
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.230
Stir with the lark tomorrow, gentle Norfolk.

126
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.570
I warrant you, my lord.

127
00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:20.130
Catesby.

128
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.630
My lord?

129
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.970
Send out a pursuivant at arms to Stanley's regiment.

130
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.800
Bid him bring his power before sunrising,

131
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.170
lest his son George

132
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.570
fall into the blind cave of eternal night.

133
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.800
Fill me a bowl of wine.

134
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.670
Give me a watch!

135
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.570
Saddle white Surrey for the field tomorrow.

136
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.230
Look that my staves be sound and not too heavy.

137
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.500
Ratcliffe.

138
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.570
My lord.

139
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.330
Sawest thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?

140
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.600
Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself,

141
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.630
much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop

142
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.200
went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.

143
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.300
So I am satisfied.

144
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.770
Give me a bowl of wine.

145
00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.000
I have not that alacrity of spirit

146
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.330
nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have.

147
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:28.770
Set it down.

148
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.500
Is ink and paper ready?

149
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.870
It is, my lord.

150
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.800
Bid my guard watch.

151
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.230
Leave me.

152
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.300
Ratcliffe.

153
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.070
About the mid of night,

154
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.770
come to my tent and help to arm me.

155
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.530
Leave me, I say.

156
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.430
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm.

157
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.930
All comfort that the dark night can afford

158
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.200
be to thy person, noble father-in-law.

159
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.500
Tell me, how fares our loving mother?

160
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.430
I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,

161
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.470
who prays continually for Richmond's good.

162
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:34.530
So much for that.

163
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.270
The silent hours steal on,

164
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.330
and flaky darkness breaks within the east.

165
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
In brief, for so the season bids us be,

166
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.330
prepare thy battle early in the morning,

167
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.300
and put thy fortune to the arbitraments

168
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.800
of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.

169
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.670
I, as I may-- that which I would I cannot--

170
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.870
with best advantage will deceive the time

171
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.530
and aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms.

172
00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.370
But on thy side, I may not be too forward

173
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.800
lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,

174
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.930
be executed in his father's sight.

175
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.130
Farewell.

176
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.400
The leisure and the fearful time

177
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.500
cuts off the ceremonious vows of love

178
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.900
which so long-sundered friends should dwell upon.

179
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.270
God give us leisure for these rites of love.

180
00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.970
Once more, adieu.

181
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.970
Be valiant, and speed well.

182
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.230
Good lords, conduct him to his regiment.

183
00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:34.670
I'll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap,

184
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.300
lest leaden slumber peise me down tomorrow,

185
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.600
when I should mount with wings of victory.

186
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.170
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.

187
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.700
O Thou, whose captain I account myself,

188
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.470
look on my forces with a gracious eye.

189
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.170
Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,

190
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.070
that they may crush down with a heavy fall

191
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.600
the usurping helmets of our adversaries.

192
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.370
Make us thy ministers of chastisement,

193
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.900
that we may praise thee in the victory.

194
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.000
To thee I do commend my watchful soul,

195
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.130
ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes.

196
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.500
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still.

197
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:14.230
My prayers on the adverse party fight.

198
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:17.630
And there the little souls of Edward's children

199
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.330
whisper the spirits of thine enemies

200
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:24.630
and promise them success and victory.

201
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.700
Bloody thou art.

202
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.530
Bloody will be thy end.

203
00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:34.630
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.

204
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.570
Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow.

205
00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.070
Think how thou stabbest me

206
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.270
in my prime of youth at Tewksbury.

207
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.230
Despair, therefore, and die.

208
00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.170
Be cheerful, Richmond,

209
00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:00.630
for the wronged souls of butchered princes

210
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.730
fight in thy behalf.

211
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:06.430
King Henry's issue, Richmond, comforts thee.

212
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.600
When I was mortal, my anointed body

213
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.530
by thee was punched full of deadly holes.

214
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.670
Think on the Tower and me.

215
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.670
Despair, and die.

216
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:24.470
Harry the Sixth bids thee despair, and die.

217
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.900
Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror.

218
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.300
Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be king,

219
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.170
doth comfort thee in thy sleep.

220
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.600
Live, and flourish.

221
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:43.170
Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow.

222
00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.000
I, that was washed to death with fulsome wine,

223
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.500
poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death.

224
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.400
Tomorrow in the battle, think on me,

225
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.030
and fall thy edgeless sword.

226
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.970
Despair, and die.

227
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.800
Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster,

228
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.000
the wronged heirs of York, do pray for thee.

229
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.800
Good angels guard thy battle.

230
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.630
Live, and flourish.

231
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.070
Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow:

232
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:21.430
Rivers, that died at Pomfret.

233
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.800
Despair, and die.

234
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:31.730
Think upon Grey, and let thy soul despair.

235
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.330
Think upon Vaughan,

236
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.830
and with guilty fear, let fall thy lance.

237
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.300
Despair, and die.

238
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.070
Awake, and think our wrongs

239
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:47.130
in Richard's bosom will conquer him.

240
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.670
Awake, and win the day.

241
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:57.570
Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake,

242
00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:02.300
and in a bloody battle, end thy days.

243
00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.570
Think on Lord Hastings.

244
00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:08.430
Despair, and die.

245
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:15.530
Quiet, untroubled soul, awake, awake.

246
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:20.870
Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake.

247
00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:25.930
Dream on thy cousins, smothered in the Tower.

248
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:30.070
Let us be led within thy bosom, Richard,

249
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:35.370
and weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death.

250
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:39.630
Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die.

251
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.730
Sleep, Richmond.

252
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:46.030
Sleep in peace, and wake in joy.

253
00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.630
Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy.

254
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:54.170
Live, and beget a happy race of kings.

255
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:58.330
Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.

256
00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:03.330
Richard, thy wife,

257
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.670
that wretched Anne, thy wife,

258
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.130
that never slept a quiet hour with thee,

259
00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.900
now fills thy sleep with perturbations.

260
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.030
Tomorrow in the battle, think on me,

261
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.830
and fall thy edgeless sword.

262
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.700
Despair, and die.

263
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.970
Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep.

264
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:29.600
Dream of success and happy victory.

265
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.430
Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.

266
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
The first was I that helped thee to the crown.

267
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.170
The last was I that felt thy tyranny.

268
00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.530
O, in the battle, think of Buckingham.

269
00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.370
Die in terror of thy guiltiness.

270
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.970
Dream on.

271
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:07.130
Dream on of bloody deeds and death.

272
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:09.200
Fainting, despair.

273
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.870
Despairing, yield thy breath.

274
00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.300
I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid.

275
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.900
But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismayed.

276
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:28.970
God and good angels fight on Richmond's side.

277
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.230
And Richard fall, in height of all his pride.

278
00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.330
Give me another horse!

279
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.830
Bind up my wounds!

280
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.400
Have mercy, Jesu.

281
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.870
Soft, I did but dream.

282
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.830
Coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me.

283
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.930
The lights burn blue.

284
00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.970
'Tis now dead midnight.

285
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.100
Cold, fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.

286
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:12.600
What do I fear?

287
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.230
Myself?

288
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.270
There's none else by.

289
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.600
Richard loves Richard.

290
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.600
That is I and I.

291
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.930
Is there a murderer here?

292
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:23.600
No. Yes, I am.

293
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.130
Then fly.

294
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.300
What, from myself?

295
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.270
Great reason why, lest I revenge.

296
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.600
What, myself upon myself?

297
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.970
Alack, I love myself.

298
00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.030
Wherefore?

299
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.100
For any good that I myself have done unto myself?

300
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.100
O, no! Alas, I rather hate myself

301
00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.630
for hateful deeds committed by myself.

302
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:40.830
I am a villain.

303
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.130
Yet I lie. I am not.

304
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:43.300
Fool, of thyself speak well.

305
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.900
Fool, do not flatter!

306
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.300
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,

307
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.530
and every tongue brings in a several tale,

308
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.530
and every tale condemns me for a villain.

309
00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:55.630
Perjury, perjury, in the highest degree.

310
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.130
Murder, stern murder, in the direst degree.

311
00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.800
All several sins, all used in each degree,

312
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.700
throng to the bar, crying all, "Guilty, guilty."

313
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.830
I shall despair.

314
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.670
There is no creature loves me.

315
00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:17.170
And if I die, no soul will pity me.

316
00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:22.900
And wherefore should they,

317
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.200
since that I myself find in myself no pity to myself?

318
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:35.070
Methought the souls of all that I'd murdered came to my tent,

319
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.870
and every one did threat tomorrow's vengeance

320
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:39.030
on the head of Richard.

321
00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.030
My lord?

322
00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.230
'Zounds. Who is there?

323
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.700
Ratcliffe, my lord.

324
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.900
'Tis I.

325
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.170
The early village cock

326
00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:49.200
hath twice done salutation to the morn.

327
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.200
Your friends are up and buckle on their armor.

328
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.400
O Ratcliffe, I have dreamed a fearful dream.

329
00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:58.800
What thinkest thou?

330
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.570
Will our friends prove all true?

331
00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:02.770
No doubt, my lord.

332
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.370
O Ratcliffe, I fear.

333
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:07.900
I fear.

334
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.730
Nay, good my lord.

335
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.830
Be not afraid of shadows.

336
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:14.870
By the apostle Paul, shadows tonight

337
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.230
have struck more terror to the soul of Richard

338
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.100
than can the substance of a thousand soldiers

339
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.030
armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.

340
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:32.070
'Tis not yet near day.

341
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:33.570
Come, go with me.

342
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:35.730
Under our tents, I'll play the eavesdropper,

343
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.230
to see if any mean to shrink from me.

344
00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:56.230
Good morrow, my lord.

345
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.270
Oh.

346
00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.130
Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,

347
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.630
that you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.

348
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.370
How have you slept, my lord?

349
00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.930
The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams

350
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.600
that ever entered in a drowsy head

351
00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.000
have I since your departure had, my lords.

352
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.630
Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murdered

353
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:20.700
came to my tent and cried on victory.

354
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.800
I promise you, my soul is very jocund

355
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.500
in the remembrance of so fair a dream.

356
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.470
How far into the morning is it, lords?

357
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:31.500
Upon the stroke of four.

358
00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:35.530
Why, then, 'tis time to arm and give direction.

359
00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:38.800
More than I have said, loving countrymen,

360
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.170
the leisure and enforcement of the time forbids to dwell upon.

361
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.970
Yet remember this:

362
00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:49.700
God and our good cause fight upon our side.

363
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.930
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,

364
00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:56.430
like high-reared bulwarks, stand before our faces,

365
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.100
Richard except.

366
00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.230
Those whom we fight against

367
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:04.500
had rather have us win than him they follow.

368
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.030
For what is he they follow?

369
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:12.770
Truly, gentlemen, a bloody tyrant and a homicide,

370
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:17.330
one raised in blood and one in blood established,

371
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.400
one that made means to come by what he hath

372
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.170
and slaughtered those that were the means to help him.

373
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:25.400
A base, foul stone,

374
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.530
made precious by the foil of England's chair,

375
00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.270
where he is falsely set.

376
00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:35.200
One that hath ever been God's enemy.

377
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.470
Then, if you fight against God's enemy,

378
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:42.300
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers.

379
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.770
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,

380
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:49.430
you sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain.

381
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.530
If you do fight against your country's foes,

382
00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:56.430
your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire.

383
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.800
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,

384
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.830
your wives shall welcome home the conquerors.

385
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.030
If you do free your children from the sword,

386
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:10.400
your children's children quits it in your age.

387
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.170
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,

388
00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.700
advance your standards; draw your willing swords.

389
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:23.230
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt

390
00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.530
shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face.

391
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.730
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt

392
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:35.200
the least of you shall share his part thereof.

393
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.800
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully.

394
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.930
God and Saint George.

395
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.800
Richmond and victory!

396
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.430
Richmond and victory!

397
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:57.330
And what said Northumberland as touching Richmond?

398
00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.100
That he was never trained up in arms.

399
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.500
He said the truth.

400
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.170
And what said Surrey then?

401
00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:04.330
He smiled and said, "The better for our purpose."

402
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:05.330
He was in the right.

403
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.770
And so indeed it is.

404
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:09.100
Ten the clock there.

405
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.230
Give me a calendar.

406
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.330
Who saw the sun today?

407
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.130
Not I, my lord.

408
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:27.770
Then he disdains to shine,

409
00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.730
for by the book, he should have braved the east an hour ago.

410
00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:33.600
A black day will it be to somebody.

411
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:37.800
Ratcliffe.

412
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.800
My lord?

413
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.230
The sun will not be seen today.

414
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.870
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.

415
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.700
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.

416
00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.270
Not shine today.

417
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.330
Why, what is that to me more than to Richmond?

418
00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:58.330
For the selfsame Heaven that frowns on me

419
00:27:58.330 --> 00:27:59.530
looks sadly upon him.

420
00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:02.130
Arm! Arm, my lord!

421
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.570
The foe vaunts in the field.

422
00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.200
Come! Bustle, bustle.

423
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.970
Caparison my horse.

424
00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:10.330
Call up Lord Stanley; bid him bring his power.

425
00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:13.030
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,

426
00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:17.270
and thus my battle shall be ordered:

427
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.800
My forward shall be drawn out all at length,

428
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.170
consisting equally of horse and foot.

429
00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:24.300
Our archers shall be placed in the midst.

430
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.500
John, Duke of Norfolk, Thomas, Earl of Surrey

431
00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.600
shall have the leading of this foot and horse.

432
00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.530
They thus directed, we will follow in the main battle,

433
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:33.230
whose puissance on either side

434
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:35.770
shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.

435
00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:37.930
This, and Saint George to boot.

436
00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:39.530
What think'st thou, Norfolk?

437
00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.670
A good direction, warlike sovereign.

438
00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.330
This I found on my tent this morning.

439
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:49.270
"Jockey of Norfolk, be not so bold,

440
00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:52.330
for Dickon, thy master, is bought and sold."

441
00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:59.770
A thing devised by the enemy.

442
00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.630
Go, gentleman, every man unto his charge.

443
00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:08.230
Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls.

444
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:10.570
Conscience is but a word that cowards use,

445
00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.000
devised at first to keep the strong in awe.

446
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.530
Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.

447
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:18.400
March on; join bravely.

448
00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.370
Let us to it pell-mell,

449
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:23.830
if not to heaven, then hand in hand to Hell.

450
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:30.570
What shall I say more than I have inferred?

451
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:33.030
Remember whom you are to cope withal:

452
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.430
a sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,

453
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:39.830
a scum of Bretons and base lackey peasants,

454
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.630
whom their o'ercloyed country vomits forth

455
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.570
to desperate adventures and assured destruction.

456
00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:49.300
You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest.

457
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.570
You having lands and blest with beauteous wives,

458
00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:56.070
they would restrain the one, disdain the other.

459
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:59.130
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,

460
00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.830
a milksop, one that never in his life

461
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:04.770
felt so much cold as overshoes in snow?

462
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.770
Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again.

463
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.870
Lash hence these overweening rags of France,

464
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:14.530
these famished beggars, weary of their lives,

465
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:17.700
who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,

466
00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.670
for want of means, poor rats, had hanged themselves.

467
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.070
If we be conquered, let men conquer us,

468
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:27.130
and not these bastard Bretons,

469
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.130
whom our fathers have in their own lands

470
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:30.830
beaten, bobbed, and thumped,

471
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:33.430
and in record, left them the heirs of shame.

472
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.070
Shall these enjoy our lands?

473
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:37.600
Lie with our wives?

474
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.800
Ravish our daughters?

475
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.900
No!

476
00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:41.700
Hark. I hear their drum.

477
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.500
Fight, gentlemen of England.

478
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.970
Fight, bold yeomen.

479
00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.730
Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head.

480
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:51.100
Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood.

481
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.030
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves.

482
00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:56.100
What says Lord Stanley? Will he bring his power?

483
00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.530
My lord, he doth deny to come.

484
00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:59.330
Off with his son George's head!

485
00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.570
My lord, the enemy is past the marsh!

486
00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:04.100
After the battle, let George Stanley die.

487
00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.570
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom.

488
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.370
Advance our standards.

489
00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:09.830
Set upon our foes.

490
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.570
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,

491
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.770
inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons.

492
00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:17.170
Upon them!

493
00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:20.970
Victory sits on our helms!

494
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:25.000
Rescue.

495
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.430
My Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!

496
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:29.570
The king enacts more wonders than a man,

497
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:31.900
daring an opposite to every danger.

498
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:36.570
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,

499
00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:39.670
seeking for Richmond in the throat of death!

500
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:44.300
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!

501
00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.570
A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!

502
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:48.570
Withdraw, my lord.

503
00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:49.730
I'll help you to a horse.

504
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:51.000
Slave!

505
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.970
I'll set my life upon a cast,

506
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.500
and I will stand the hazard of the die.

507
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.070
I think there be six Richmonds in the field.

508
00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:00.670
Five have I slain today instead of him.

509
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:02.870
A horse! A horse!

510
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:04.370
My kingdom for a horse!

511
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:05.730
Richard!

512
00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.170
For Richmond!

513
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:13.330
For Richmond!

514
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.830
Richmond!

515
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.270
For Richmond!

516
00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:12.870
God and your arms be praised, victorious friends.

517
00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:16.200
The day is ours.

518
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.270
The bloody dog is dead.

519
00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:32.770
Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.

520
00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:38.100
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty.

521
00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:42.330
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.

522
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.100
Great God of Heaven, say Amen to all.

523
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.670
But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?

524
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:06.530
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town,

525
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.730
whither, if it please you, we will now withdraw us.

526
00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.900
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled

527
00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.270
that in submission will return to us.

528
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:20.600
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,

529
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.530
we will unite the white rose and the red.

530
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.570
Smile, Heaven, upon this fair conjunction

531
00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:29.700
that long have frowned upon their enmity.

532
00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.130
What traitor hears me and says not Amen?

533
00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:37.830
Amen.

534
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:48.070
England hath long been mad and scarred herself.

535
00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:52.000
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,

536
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.470
the father rashly slaughtered his own son,

537
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:58.470
the son, compelled, been butcher to the sire.

538
00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:02.070
All this divided York and Lancaster,

539
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:04.030
delighted in their dire division.

540
00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:15.200
O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth,

541
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.830
the true succeeders of each royal house,

542
00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:21.800
by God's fair ordinance conjoin together.

543
00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.670
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so,

544
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:27.830
enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,

545
00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:31.400
with smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days.

546
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:35.300
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,

547
00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.630
that would reduce these bloody days again

548
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:41.130
and make poor England weep in streams of blood.

549
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:45.130
Let them not live to taste this land's increase

550
00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:48.700
that would with treason wound this fair land's peace.

551
00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.100
Now civil wounds are stopped.

552
00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.300
Peace lives again.

553
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.430
That she may long live here, God say amen!

554
00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:51.730
