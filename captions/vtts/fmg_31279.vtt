00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000



00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:08.560

        [MUSIC PLAYING]


00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.840

        The planet's got a lot
        of people on it.
      

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.070

        It has six billion today, but
        in the next 25 years, we'll
      

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.750

        add two billion people
        to the planet.
      

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.970

        So it becomes a extremely
        important issue that all of us
      

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.610

        should join together to protect
        the planet that
      

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.860

        we're living on.


00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.560



00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.860

        The world is growing in terms
        of its population, and
      

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.530

        people's aspiration to have a
        better tomorrow than today is,
      

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.370

        I believe, in the minds
        of everybody.
      

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:54.660



00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.210

        Each citizen, each entrepreneur
        in miniature, and
      

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.960

        each politician is responsible
        to keep our planet wealth to
      

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.810

        live on for our children for
        the next generations.
      

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.050



00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.960

        Every life support system that
        together make up the
      

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.610

        biosphere--


00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.760

        they're all in decline.


00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.960

        And it is the externalization
        of cost that's
      

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.070

        allowing that to happen.


00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.420

        The trashing of the biosphere.


00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:54.360



00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.360

        We are losing our biodiversity
        at a very rapid rate, and this
      

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.780

        is as a result of the human
        pressures on the environment
      

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.890

        in which we're living.


00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.260

        We lose, as an example, timber
        holdings the extent of the
      

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.350

        size of Switzerland
        every year.
      

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.550

        The economy is truly the wholly
        owned subsidiary of the
      

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.390

        environment.


00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.610

        The economy takes in from
        the environment air--
      

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.040

        fancy getting along
        without air--
      

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.990

        water, food, energy.


00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.630

        And it gives off in the other
        direction waste, pollution,
      

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.460

        carbon dioxide, greenhouse
        gases, et cetera, et cetera.
      

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.840

        And the result of all of that
        is the economy grows and the
      

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.750

        environment shrinks.


00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.060

        How long can that go on?


00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.960

        There is most certainly a limit,
        and it's in businesses
      

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.080

        interest to be sure that
        that stability is
      

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.300

        achieved in those flows.


00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.040

        That equilibrium is achieved--


00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.280

        that is, sustainability.


00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.070

        The key driving force for
        unsustainability, in my view,
      

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.290

        is a system of economics that
        allows the externalization of
      

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.400

        cost. A system that attaches
        focus only on exchange value
      

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.660

        without regard to use value
        and puts no value
      

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.410

        whatsoever on nature.


00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.500

        You have to act in a
        sustainable way.
      

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.820

        That means that we should
        not use more nature
      

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.040

        than it can be recreated.


00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.660

        And therefore, I think,
        sustainable practices are very
      

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.490

        important--


00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.040

        for companies, but, I think,
        for the society at all.
      

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.750

        Everyone must recognize that the
        world which surrounds them
      

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.440

        isn't free.


00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.890

        So we can't actually go and use
        the environment as if it's
      

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.550

        someone else's problem
        to sort out.
      

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.250

        It belongs to everybody, and
        so we've got to take
      

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.970

        proportionate share in making
        sure that whatever we do with
      

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.310

        the external world, the
        externalities of activity are
      

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.180

        somehow incorporated in the full
        cost of the activity that
      

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.170

        takes place.


00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.230

        And something is done to reduce
        the impact on things
      

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.380

        which belong to everybody.


00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.610

        No normal person, be he rich or
        poor, would prefer to live
      

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.320

        in an arid desert without access
        to forests or without
      

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.170

        access to clean water or in a
        polluted environment which
      

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.950

        affects their health rather than
        live in an environment
      

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.340

        which can promote not only their
        financial wealth but
      

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.310

        their personal wealth in
        terms of the way in
      

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.640

        which they're living.


00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.330

        But poor people are not very
        different than rich people.
      

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.240

        They, again, know the difference
        between a good life
      

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.150

        and a bad life.


00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.750

        They know the difference
        between clean
      

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.750

        air and unclean air.


00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.660

        They know the difference between
        putting their health
      

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.090

        at risk and being able to drink
        the water or to live in
      

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.820

        a noxious-free environment.


00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.540

        And so the issue is really
        answered by you asking
      

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.360

        yourself, why would you want to
        live in an environment that
      

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.840

        is being ruined?


00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.810

        In terms of the way the
        corporations conduct
      

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.720

        themselves, they need to
        recognize that spewing out
      

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.980

        noxious fumes into the
        atmosphere or putting acid
      

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.760

        into water or putting toxic
        materials in the ground may be
      

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.170

        a short-term expediency, but in
        the long term, will affect
      

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.800

        the people around them, who
        sometimes get so mad that they
      

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.490

        turn the factory into rubble
        by tearing it down.
      

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.140



00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:43.140

        So there is a connection between
        what is both ethically
      

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.060

        and morally and even
        economically indefensible and
      

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.130

        the pressure which comes
        on companies.
      

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.210

        And that is being demonstrated
        now in quite a number of
      

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:57.530

        ways-- both by a push on the
        companies and by consumers
      

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.990

        taking products for companies
        which adopt what they call a
      

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.860

        triple bottom line of social
        responsibility, environmental
      

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.460

        responsibility, as
        well as profits.
      

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.090



00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.720

        For us, there are two things
        that we focus on which make
      

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.640

        our business, I think, better
        for the future.
      

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.210

        And these are the natural
        environment and the way in
      

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.510

        which we deal with communities
        and human rights.
      

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.390



00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.870

        I think it's all
        about progress.
      

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.460

        Technology, of course, is so
        critical in this area.
      

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.770

        I mean, the rate of progress
        of technology is
      

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.480

        not going to stop.


00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.020

        We look over the last
        200 years--
      

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.960

        there's been continuous
        progress.
      

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.260

        I can't possibly believe that
        it's not going to carry on.
      

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.160

        The gasoline that we make today
        bears no relationship to
      

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160

        the gasoline made
        10 years ago.
      

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.040

        It has no benzene, no sulfur,
        no lead in most
      

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.530

        parts of the world.


00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.460

        And so it's about progress.


00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.720

        And curiously, I believe that
        all the problems that people
      

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.360

        see with development are best
        solved by more development
      

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.590

        rather than less.


00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.890

        Every single way you look at
        the world, it's clear the
      

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.940

        world's going to consume more
        hydrocarbons every day as
      

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.900

        peoples of the world develop.


00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.320

        One of the fundamentals of
        development is its energy.
      

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.140

        It gives people the aspiration
        to have light and heat or cool
      

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.620

        and mobility.


00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.960

        And this is a very, very
        important component of the
      

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.760

        world's future progress.


00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.290

        However we look at energy, a
        large bulk of it will come
      

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.730

        from hydrocarbons for the
        foreseeable future.
      

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:44.150

        I'm sure there'll be other types
        of engines added to the
      

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.990

        overall fleet of cars and
        trucks, but there's a lot of
      

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:54.360

        room still for huge efficiency
        gains and hugely better output
      

00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:00.940

        of emissions from the internal
        combustion engine.
      

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.210

        Now, first question to ask is,
        why on earth should we bother?
      

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.680

        And indeed, some readings of the
        way in which the economics
      

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.880

        of business work is to
        say, well, we're
      

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.740

        in shareholder value.


00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.830

        We're in the business of
        increasing shareholder value.
      

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.610

        And people look very short-range
        and say, and
      

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.030

        that's a quarterly thing.


00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.800

        Every 90 days you have to do
        something, so let's not bother
      

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.710

        with any of this.


00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.070

        We're in the business of being
        in business, and if the
      

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.850

        world's free, let's
        use it that way.
      

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.320

        This, I think, is a deep
        misconception of
      

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.370

        the nature of business.


00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.160

        First of all, the value of
        a business is set by its
      

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.840

        long-term growth rate.


00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.870

        Long-term.


00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.820

        All the value is
        in the future.
      

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.350

        Not in the past and not
        in the quarter.
      

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.530

        And in all my business in
        particular, we have to deal
      

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.470

        with 50 to 100 year
        time scales.
      

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.450

        Having a sense of social
        responsibility and
      

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.100

        environmental responsibility
        does not by any means mean
      

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.670

        that you make less money than
        you do if you are behaving in
      

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.310

        an appropriate way.


00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.780

        I believe personally that we
        will only realize real value
      

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.920

        by doing what we do in an


00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.580

        environmentally responsible way.


00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.740



00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.860

        In the summer of 1994,
        the company was
      

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.990

        already 21 years old.


00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.400

        And for the first time, we began
        to hear a whisper from
      

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.070

        our marketplace--


00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.260

        mainly from interior designers
        and architects--
      

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.260

        asking, what is your company
        doing for the environment?
      

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.080

        And we really had no
        answers for that.
      

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.000

        And while I was sweating, Paul
        Hawken's book, The Ecology of
      

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.270

        Commerce, landed on my desk.


00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:44.030

        And I began to read it, and
        very quickly it became, as
      

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.860

        I've described it many times,
        a spear in the chest. A real
      

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.650

        emotional, epiphanal
        experience.
      

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.090

        And it convicted me
        on the spot as a
      

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.760

        plunderer of the earth.


00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.170

        And I knew immediately what I
        had to say to our people, and
      

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.800

        that is that we should be the
        company that leads the
      

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.220

        industrial world toward
        sustainability.
      

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.570

        Somebody has to lead.


00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:06.820

        Why not us?


00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:14.580



00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.030

        We've eliminated half the waste
        in our company over the
      

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.040

        last six years, and that's
        measuring waste against
      

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.180

        perfection.


00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.280

        That says, do it right the
        first time, every time.
      

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.100

        No scrap, no off-quality.


00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:27.850

        Perfection.


00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:31.720

        And against that very harsh
        standard, we've
      

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.820

        reduced waste by half.


00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.380

        And there's much, much more to
        be done there as we move ahead
      

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.310

        on closed-loop production
        processes, including
      

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.910

        retrieving our products at the
        end of their useful life and
      

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.280

        giving them life after life.


00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.720

        Capturing those precious organic
        molecules and giving
      

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.280

        them life after life.


00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.000

        We've studied Mount
        Sustainability very, very
      

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000

        carefully, and so far,
        we've found seven
      

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.630

        faces of the mountain.


00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.670

        And we're intent on climbing
        all seven and
      

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.850

        meeting at the top.


00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.630

        And that defines, for
        us, sustainability.
      

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:05.920

        Zero footprint--


00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.680

        picture the point at the
        top of that mountain.
      

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.800

        The seven faces of the mountain
        are: eliminate waste.
      

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.110

        Benign emissions--


00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.930

        to be sure whatever we emit is
        benign and harmless to the
      

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:18.890

        environment.


00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.080

        Renewable energy--


00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.050

        first efficiency, and
        then switching
      

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.590

        to renewable sources.


00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.190

        Closing the loop on
        material flows.
      

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.080

        Carbon-neutral transportation.


00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.940

        When we've sited our factors
        near their markets, which we
      

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.990

        do in planned logistics for
        maximum efficiency, which we
      

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.790

        try to do when we
        videoconference to save them
      

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:38.590

        this [UNINTELLIGIBLE].


00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:42.380

        When we've done it all, there
        will still be a carbon gap.
      

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.970

        And truly, only the automotive
        industry can close that gap.
      

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.750

        We'll do our best with
        carbon offsets.
      

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.400

        Today we plant trees--


00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.520

        trees for travel.


00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.390

        I'm told that a tree, in its
        lifetime, will sequester the
      

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:58.620

        carbon generated by 4,000
        passenger miles in a
      

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.200

        commercial jet.


00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.240

        So every time one of our people
        flies 4,000 miles, we
      

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.510

        plant a tree.


00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.580

        Sensitizing our people and the
        whole community of interest--
      

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.570

        customers, suppliers,
        the communities
      

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.500

        from which were come.


00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.360

        Creating, if you will, an
        ecosystem around interface
      

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.240

        where cooperation is the
        prevailing mode, as opposed to
      

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.910

        confrontation.


00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.520

        And finally, reinventing
        commerce.
      

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.100

        When all the rest of this is in
        place, it will be possible
      

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.740

        for us to sell the service that
        our product delivers,
      

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.230

        rather than selling the
        product itself.
      

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.530

        And that is good ecology.


00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:41.180

        We started, of course, with the
        question of sustainability
      

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.600

        in the late '70s and
        also in the '80s.
      

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:49.000

        There we had mainly single
        projects within our company.
      

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.500

        But in the second half of the
        '80s, we started to act more
      

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.350

        systematically.


00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.420

        And there, we started
        to analyze all
      

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.210

        areas of the company.


00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:07.470

        And that means, of course, all
        processes within company were
      

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.280

        analyzed, and we changed
        the processes.
      

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:17.000

        Another area had been the
        assortment of our catalogs--
      

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.940

        that we have 120,000 articles
        in a way that's open.
      

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.410

        So it's an ongoing process to
        analyze all products and to
      

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:29.410

        change them to environmentally
        friendly products.
      

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:33.360

        Wood and cotton are very
        sensitive areas, so it would
      

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.180

        take wooden products like
        furniture or paper-- how does
      

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.890

        the wood come from?


00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:42.740

        And how is the whole
        production chain?
      

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:49.570

        It is very important that we
        use sustainable forestry.
      

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.020

        We must also, for the
        question, how
      

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.800

        can we secure this?


00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.480

        And there we found the label
        for Stewardship Council,
      

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.970

        that's the national organization
        supported by many
      

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:08.270

        NGOs which is giving
        certificates to forests which
      

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.970

        are having a sustainable
        forestry policy.
      

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:16.330



00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.490

        The same with cotton.


00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:25.320

        I think there, we know that
        cotton is using a lot of
      

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:31.010

        water, and it's spoiling water
        by fertilizer, by chemicals.
      

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:36.460

        And therefore, we have also to
        start with the cotton plants.
      

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:41.390

        We helped to change cotton
        plants into environmentally
      

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.820

        friendly production of plants.


00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:51.090



00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:55.250

        As you will see on television,
        many, many of the ads that are
      

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.900

        now appearing showing little
        children running across a
      

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.350

        carefree country scene saying,
        my dad works for such and such
      

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.900

        a company, and they make
        this possible.
      

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.080

        If you're a hard-headed
        businessman and you're looking
      

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.010

        about marketing, those ads
        would not be going on
      

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:14.550

        television unless it was
        having an impact.
      

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.460

        So it's very clear in the
        behavior of companies that
      

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:23.900

        they are anxious to project not
        only a profitable future,
      

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.750

        but also a morally and ethically
        sound future.
      

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:31.810

        And there's a lot of reason to
        think that the two are not
      

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:32.860

        incompatible.


00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:41.570

        If your company acts
        sustainable, then I think it
      

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:45.260

        gets, of course, a positive
        reputation which will help
      

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.930

        also for the public relation
        of the company.
      

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:56.100



00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.910

        We have many cases where we
        can do environmentally
      

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:04.010

        friendly things and
        even save costs.
      

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.170

        For example, if we save
        energy, we save costs.
      

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.610

        And on the other hand, also
        it's positive for the
      

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:10.860

        environment.


00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:16.000



00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.450

        Trade, of course, is
        always done frankly
      

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.450

        for economical reasons--


00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.460

        that the trading company
        wants to make profits.
      

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:32.850

        And therefore, trading companies
        are importing from
      

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.080

        companies and from countries
        where they
      

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.620

        get the best prices.


00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.410

        So we have to have define
        standards, which frankly can
      

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:44.720

        be reached also by companies
        of the third world.
      

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.310

        And what is very important--


00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:52.020

        we have to support our
        manufacturers to reach these
      

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.860

        social standards.


00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.160

        As we have a certain size and
        therefore a certain buying
      

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.980

        power, this is going to affect
        choice, of course, and trusted
      

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.590

        to meet our standards.


00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:07.310

        These standards, of course,
        are required--
      

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:14.030

        no child labor, and minimum
        wages, and walking hours, and
      

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:19.040

        the no discrimination and
        respect of gender and the
      

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.870

        respect of religion
        or ethnic groups.
      

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.820

        It is very important.


00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.700

        They don't have the feuding that
        we are just dictate them
      

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:32.470

        what they have to do, but
        that we are cooperative.
      

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:37.380

        That we want to work together
        with them to help the
      

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.510

        environment, to help the people,
        and finally, to make a
      

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:41.760

        good business together.


00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:47.320



00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.790

        Well, the role of the private
        sector is incredibly
      

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:53.190

        important, because first and
        foremost, if you can provide
      

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.040

        jobs to people, that's the
        first key out of poverty.
      

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.040

        You need to have growth.


00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.250

        And people that live in an
        atmosphere where they have
      

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.990

        opportunity and where they can
        improve their life standards
      

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.050

        are obviously much better able
        to cater to the environment
      

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.740

        around in which they live.


00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.720

        I think behind all this is a
        growing recognition on the
      

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:20.480

        part of individual human beings
        that it is an economic
      

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:25.930

        and social cost not to take
        advantage sensible practices
      

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:27.260

        for sustainable development.


00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.250

        And of course the bank plays
        a partnership role
      

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.660

        with all the players.


00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:37.680

        For example, after the
        discussions on the various
      

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.610

        environmental treaties--


00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:43.660

        Kyoto being a turning point--


00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:49.940

        we started a carbon fund in
        which we could offer companies
      

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:54.980

        the possibility of reducing
        their exposure in terms of
      

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:59.760

        carbon emissions by buying
        certificates that would in
      

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.930

        fact appreciate the environment
        rather than
      

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.950

        depreciate it.


00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:09.890

        That was a prototype fund with
        about $145 million in it,
      

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.260

        bringing governments and private
        sector together.
      

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.490

        What we're trying to do, and
        the real test of our
      

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:19.990

        organization, will be less the
        specific initiatives that we
      

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:23.970

        can point to in a box, but much
        more importantly, how
      

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.760

        they integrated into
        every activity in
      

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.710

        which you're engaged.


00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.780

        All business, I think, in
        some way or another, has
      

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.910

        to think about it.


00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.390

        All business, I believe, is
        beginning to think about it.
      

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.780

        There are degrees and
        degrees of thought.
      

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.820

        And of course, the
        counterbalance to all this is
      

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.550

        what governments do.


00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.790

        And governments are there to
        express some sort of general
      

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.820

        intent of the populations
        that they govern.
      

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.640

        And they, in turn, have to have
        a role in providing a
      

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:56.120

        framework in which business
        can operate, such that one
      

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:01.130

        business cannot take advantage
        of another business.
      

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:04.620

        What we're finding is that in
        the bank we're being asked
      

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:08.370

        more and more to consult with
        governments on the framework
      

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.430

        in which company
        should operate.
      

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:14.800

        And in fact, in our whole
        approach to development now,
      

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.620

        which we call a comprehensive
        approach--
      

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.280

        like a comprehensive development
        framework--
      

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.750

        we try and establish the good
        governance and the framework
      

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:28.700

        of laws and protection
        of rights.
      

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.370

        International standards
        are getting
      

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:31.720

        more and more important.


00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:38.140

        As societies are getting more
        and more global, therefore we
      

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.250

        have to set rules--


00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:45.630

        how they live together, how they
        work together, how they
      

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.030

        play together.


00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:55.890

        Rules in the financial area,
        rules of foreign policy--
      

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.610

        how governments are
        working together--
      

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:06.500

        but also rules how people can
        protect the environment and
      

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.370

        how social standards are set.


00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:15.390

        I think the NGOs are getting
        more and more important,
      

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:21.640

        because the public realized that
        they are more neutral.
      

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:26.050

        They trust the NGOs, and
        therefore the NGOs are, I
      

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:30.190

        think, getting more and more
        influence in all societies.
      

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:34.430

        So you really want to have a
        development of a process in
      

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:35.300

        countries--


00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.990

        both developed and developing
        countries--
      

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:41.510

        where the legal and judicial
        system is such that you can
      

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:46.180

        set up a framework for
        supervision and monitoring.
      

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.470

        Not only through the courts, but
        also, might I add, through
      

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.210

        the regulatory system for the
        strengthening of government.
      

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.550

        But you need a coherent
        system, because just
      

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.900

        regulations, unless you have
        a legal and enforceable
      

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.370

        mechanism, doesn't
        mean anything.
      

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:00.840

        I believe the power is
        with the people.
      

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.430

        I believe people have to lead.


00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.640

        It is the people who are
        the marketplace.
      

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.290

        It's the people who
        are the voters.
      

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:09.670

        Government has its role.


00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.810

        It has taxing power, and it
        would be possible for
      

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:18.510

        governments to redress the
        externalities and internalize
      

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.580

        the externalities through an
        enlightened taxation policy.
      

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:25.330

        Taxing good things that you'd
        like to encourage, like income
      

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.530

        and property, to tax bad
        things you'd like to
      

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:32.050

        discourage, like waste and
        pollution of carbon dioxide.
      

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.030

        So a tax shift in a
        revenue-neutral would change
      

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.660

        the world as we know it.


00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.680

        But ultimately, the


00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.610

        marketplace will move business.


00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:46.370

        I think in very poor countries,
        the individual
      

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:52.210

        sometimes doesn't have the
        possibility to choose between
      

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:53.350

        different offers.


00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.850

        Sometimes they are happy if they
        get some product at all.
      

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:58.860

        But in the industrialized
        countries--
      

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:03.110

        there we have enough competition
        so the consumer
      

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.140

        really plays an important
        role.
      

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:09.480

        Every day, he can decide where
        he wants to buy a product and
      

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.320

        what product he wants to buy.


00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.080



00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.040

        All of us should join together
        to protect the planet that
      

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.740

        we're living on.


00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.870

        It's really a planetary context,
        different from the
      

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.780

        way in which we were
        used to thinking
      

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.950

        when I went to school.


00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.660

        But it's very real, and it
        affects the lives and
      

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:34.870

        opportunities of poor people
        but also rich people.
      

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:37.700

        Can business provide
        the leadership?
      

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.240

        One would like to think so, but
        for sure it cannot happen
      

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.630

        unless business comes
        along, whether
      

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.480

        business leads or follows.


00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.690

        It must be part of the solution
        to the problem.
      

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:54.080

        Otherwise, it can drag the whole
        outfit down and destroy
      

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.110

        the effort, and in the process,
        destroy life on earth
      

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.990

        as we know it.


00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.600

        I mean, that's the
        alternative.
      

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.960

        Wouldn't it be good if all the
        experiences that everybody had
      

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.820

        within a company, or as between
        companies, were
      

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:10.070

        shared, so that the best way
        of doing something was
      

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.760

        immediately applied to the
        next time you did it?
      

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.530

        The key is to find out who
        they are and to have a
      

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:20.690

        dialogue with them to see
        what you can learn.
      

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:21.820

        There are signs--


00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:27.020

        real signs, tangible signs--
        that people are waking up.
      

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.620

        And in my mind, that is that
        the driving force for this.
      

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.120

        It is the hope of the future--


00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.990

        that people will rise up and
        demand the products, the
      

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:41.010

        processes, the approaches
        by government.
      

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:43.620

        What we're doing at the bank is
        trying to bring a number of
      

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.760

        these people together and
        it is not difficult.
      

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.820

        It is not difficult to bring
        them together both to meet
      

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:53.120

        with each other, to meet with
        civil society, to meet with
      

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.140

        environmentalists, to meet with
        our own people, to meet
      

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.110

        with other institutions and
        with government officials,
      

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.630

        just to try and kick things
        around on the basis that if it
      

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:08.090

        doesn't cost you any more to
        do things right, and if it
      

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.550

        preserves also the future, and
        it contributes to the general
      

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:16.350

        good, then that's a better
        decision than one which is to
      

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:19.780

        spoil the general good and make
        people's lives terrible.
      

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.860

        So this is not rocket science.


00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.920

        This is just good sense.


00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.090

        Good sense for an individual and
        good sense for business.
      

00:26:27.090 --> 00:28:14.140
