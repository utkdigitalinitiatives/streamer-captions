00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.667
(dramatic music)

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.900
- [Voiceover] Asia and
Africa are both hosts

00:00:33.458 --> 00:00:35.417
to several early
civilizations of the world.

00:00:35.583 --> 00:00:38.999
They witnessed the
evolution of various species

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:41.999
as well as the
advancements of mankind

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:44.250
in the sciences, politics,

00:00:44.417 --> 00:00:47.834
and, of course, agriculture.

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:51.417
Aside from being a
source of priceless

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:53.667
ancient knowledge
and traditions,

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:55.999
these two continents are
also known pioneer sources

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.709
of a very valuable
crop called millet.

00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:02.959
It is believed that
millet was cultivated

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:05.834
and domesticated
in both continents

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:07.834
around the same time
during the Neolithic Era

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:11.417
around 7,000 to
10,000 years ago.

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:15.291
It then spread to Egypt where
it was grown in the Sahara

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:18.999
to India which is now
the world's top producer,

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:22.667
to Europe at the beginning
of the Common Era,

00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:25.709
and to America in 1875.

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:28.792
Millet actually does not
refer to a specific plant.

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:33.667
It's a generic name
used to categorize

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:35.792
over 6,000 varieties, or species

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.999
of small seeded annual grasses

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:41.500
that grow around the world,

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:43.999
and are harvested for both human

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:45.959
and animal consumption.

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:47.999
Out of these 6,000 species
the widely cultivated are

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:52.750
Pennisetum Glaucum,
or pearl millet;

00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:56.625
Panicum Miliaceum,
or proso millet;

00:01:56.792 --> 00:02:00.792
Eleusine Coracana,
or finger millet;

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.208
and Setaria Italaca,
or foxtail millet.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:10.208
Pearl millet is the most
commonly cultivated specie,

00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:13.667
and is believed to have
originated in West Africa.

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:17.333
It's still grown in the
semi-arid regions of Africa

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.834
specifically from
Senegal to Somalia.

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.917
Pearl millet grows
up to 3 meters tall

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:27.041
with alternating leaves

00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:28.417
that are up to 1.5 meters long.

00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:31.500
Its grains vary in shape
as well as in color

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:34.375
like white, pale
yellow, brown gray,

00:02:34.542 --> 00:02:37.999
blue, and purple.

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:40.999
It's resilient to
heat or drought,

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:42.999
but also thrives well in
areas where annual rainfall

00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:46.417
ranges from 125 to
900 millimeters.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:50.291
Foxtail millet is the second

00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:53.500
most commonly produced millet,

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:55.500
and it's also
believed to be one of

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:57.000
the oldest cultivated
crops dating back

00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:59.959
as far as 5,000
years ago in China.

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.125
It is tolerant to
varying types of soil,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.291
higher altitudes, and
can be easily grown

00:03:06.458 --> 00:03:09.166
in both temperate and
tropical climates.

00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:11.999
It matures easily
around 65 to 90 days

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:15.959
especially in warm areas,

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:17.875
and it grows up to
one meter in height.

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:20.999
Proso millet also
called common millet

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:25.125
is believed to be
domesticated first

00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:27.417
in Manchuria, China,
before it was introduced

00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:30.166
to Europe about 3,000 years ago.

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:33.999
It matures easily
within 60 to 90 days,

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:37.999
and doesn't demand
too much water to grow

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:40.750
which makes it very adaptable

00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:42.417
to the dry and high lands
of China and Russia.

00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:45.959
In the United States, Russia,

00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:49.458
and some South
American countries,

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:51.834
proso millet is primarily
used as livestock feed

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:55.125
and birdseed, and it's not
typically grown in Africa.

00:03:55.291 --> 00:03:59.583
Finger millet is a
specie originating

00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:02.458
from Ethiopia, and
was brought to India

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:05.250
4,000 years ago.

00:04:05.417 --> 00:04:07.959
Like proso millet, it's
tolerant to the dry soils

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.999
of high elevations.

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:13.208
It actually thrives
well in high altitudes

00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:16.250
in Uganda, Kenya,
Zaire, Tanzania,

00:04:16.417 --> 00:04:20.917
Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe,

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:24.208
and even in the Himalayas
at 2,300 meters.

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:28.625
Its cultivation is primarily
for human consumption

00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:31.999
especially to more than
25 countries in Africa

00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:35.208
and Asia where it has
become a staple food.

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:38.999
Today, millet is the sixth
most important cereal crop

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:42.542
in the world, and
with its ability

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:44.834
to thrive in moistureless soils,

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:47.000
and withstand rough climates,

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:49.291
it might not just
be a suitable crop

00:04:49.458 --> 00:04:51.458
in the largely
semi-arid African soil,

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:54.542
but also in many
parts of the world

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:56.875
that are gradually experiencing
warmer temperatures

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:59.583
brought about by climate change.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.999
Whole grain's reputation
as healthy foods

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:22.250
is largely due to
their high protein

00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:24.500
and fiber contents.

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:26.834
Many find it more
practical and efficient

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:29.458
to obtain their
protein requirements

00:05:29.625 --> 00:05:31.208
from whole grains such as
millet rather than meat

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:34.875
because they get more
fiber too in the process.

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:38.999
Finger millet stands out
among the millet varieties

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:43.750
because of its
methionine content.

00:05:43.917 --> 00:05:46.750
Methionine is one of the
eight essential amino acids

00:05:46.917 --> 00:05:49.999
that the body cannot
synthesize on its own

00:05:50.125 --> 00:05:52.875
so it must be included
in one's diet.

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:56.583
It's used to treat
certain liver disorders,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.083
depression, allergies, asthma,

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.999
and even Parkinson's
Disease, and schizophrenia.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.750
Also, together with Vitamin B,

00:06:06.917 --> 00:06:08.999
methionine boosts the
body's sulphur levels

00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:12.083
aiding tissue repair,

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.834
and promoting healthy
joint cartilage

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:15.875
for people with arthritis.

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:18.291
Like most grains,
millet's fiber content

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.999
is beneficial to
people who are at risk

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.583
of hypertension, heart
diseases, and diabetes.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.875
Its insoluble fiber also reduces

00:06:30.917 --> 00:06:32.999
excessive bile acid secretion

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:35.542
thus limiting one's chances
to develop gall stones.

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:39.999
Let's take a look at how
the nutrient profiles

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.333
of different millet
varieties fare

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.417
against wheat and rice.

00:06:46.583 --> 00:06:49.041
First, let's take a look
at their fiber content.

00:06:50.834 --> 00:06:53.834
Wheat has 2 grams,
while rice has only 1.

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:58.834
Now, the millet grains.

00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:01.166
Finger millet has 3.6 grams.

00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:04.041
Pearl millet has 2.

00:07:04.208 --> 00:07:06.083
Foxtail has 6.7.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.333
Proso has 5.2, and the
barnyard variety has

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.083
an impressive 13.6
grams of fiber.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.959
Second, their calcium content.

00:07:19.458 --> 00:07:22.000
Wheat has 30 milligrams,

00:07:22.166 --> 00:07:24.583
and rice has 33 milligrams.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.625
These are low in contrast to
pearl millet's 42 milligrams,

00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:31.999
and finger millet's
staggering 344 milligrams.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.667
Third, their
phosphorous content.

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:41.667
While wheat is leading
in phosphorous content

00:07:41.834 --> 00:07:44.166
at 306 milligrams,

00:07:44.333 --> 00:07:46.999
rice trails behind the
millet grains at 160.

00:07:47.041 --> 00:07:51.542
Proso millet has 206 milligrams.

00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:54.999
Finger millet has 283,

00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:58.458
and foxtail millet is
packed with 290 milligrams.

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:03.458
Fourth, their iron content.

00:08:06.166 --> 00:08:08.667
While some millet
varieties are at par

00:08:08.834 --> 00:08:10.959
with wheat when
it comes to iron,

00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:13.083
there are varieties that
are far more superior.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.417
Wheat has 3.5 milligrams.

00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:19.542
Rice only has 1.8,

00:08:19.709 --> 00:08:22.500
while pearl millet
has 11 milligrams,

00:08:22.667 --> 00:08:25.667
and barnyard millet
has 18.6 milligrams.

00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:30.000
Millet grains are
also rich sources

00:08:30.166 --> 00:08:33.250
of thiamine and niacin,

00:08:33.417 --> 00:08:35.166
and are comparable
to wheat and rice.

00:08:35.333 --> 00:08:37.959
Another fascinating
thing about millet

00:08:39.166 --> 00:08:41.583
is its high
alkalinity which means

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.375
it can help the body
balance its acid levels,

00:08:44.542 --> 00:08:47.375
and in the long run can
prevent osteoporosis.

00:08:47.542 --> 00:08:50.041
How?

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.283
When the body's acid
level goes too high,

00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:55.000
the bones release calcium

00:08:55.166 --> 00:08:56.999
to bring it back
to normal levels.

00:08:56.999 --> 00:08:59.458
Millet's alkaline properties
can prevent the bones

00:08:59.625 --> 00:09:02.250
from releasing too much calcium

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.166
when the acid
levels become high.

00:09:04.333 --> 00:09:07.500
Just a little reminder though,

00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:09.999
millet contains goitrogen,

00:09:10.041 --> 00:09:12.333
a substance that limits
the thyroid glands

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.709
from absorbing iodine
which can lead to goiter.

00:09:14.875 --> 00:09:18.917
So just take caution
if millet is part

00:09:18.999 --> 00:09:21.500
of your regular diet.

00:09:21.667 --> 00:09:23.625
Unlike quinoa which
was almost forgotten,

00:09:33.375 --> 00:09:36.417
millet has never lost
its value and relevance

00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:39.125
all these years.

00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:41.542
It may still be
known as birdseed,

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:46.875
but the increasing
interest of people

00:09:46.999 --> 00:09:48.999
in plant-based
proteins bodes well

00:09:49.083 --> 00:09:51.667
for the future of this grain.

00:09:51.834 --> 00:09:54.667
Hailing from continents
of early civilizations,

00:10:19.875 --> 00:10:23.625
millet has long
established itself

00:10:23.792 --> 00:10:25.999
not just as a
staple food source,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.875
but also as a
significant contributor

00:10:28.999 --> 00:10:31.041
and player in
various traditions,

00:10:31.208 --> 00:10:33.375
customs, and practices.

00:10:33.542 --> 00:10:36.542
The Chinese revered
millet, and considered it

00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:39.125
as one of their
five sacred grains.

00:10:39.291 --> 00:10:42.250
Fan Sheng-Chih Shu,
a text from 2,800 BC

00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:46.583
is the first document to mention

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.542
the five sacred grains.

00:10:48.709 --> 00:10:50.999
There is no exact
list identifying

00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:52.999
what these five grains are,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
but in several
versions of the list,

00:10:55.166 --> 00:10:57.125
millet was always included.

00:10:57.291 --> 00:10:59.750
According to the list written
in the Classic of Rites,

00:10:59.917 --> 00:11:02.999
one of the five
Confucian classics,

00:11:03.125 --> 00:11:05.583
the five grains are
hemp, wheat, soy beans,

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.125
proso millet, and
foxtail millet.

00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:12.250
In some lists, they
are soybeans, wheat,

00:11:12.417 --> 00:11:15.041
broomcorn, hemp,
and foxtail millet.

00:11:15.208 --> 00:11:19.083
In the epic poem "Hei'anzhuan",

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.709
they are rice, adzuki
beans, soybeans,

00:11:21.875 --> 00:11:25.000
barley and wheat, and millet.

00:11:25.166 --> 00:11:28.417
Houji was one of
the Chinese deities,

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:34.834
and was celebrated as
the God of Agriculture.

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:38.000
"Hou" in his name means
sovereign or Lord,

00:11:38.166 --> 00:11:41.083
and "ji" means millet.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.208
His name can be
literally translated

00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:45.458
as Lord of millet.

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:47.583
According to stories,
Houji was responsible

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.417
for distributing grains,

00:11:50.583 --> 00:11:51.999
and teaching people
how to cultivate them.

00:11:51.999 --> 00:11:54.999
Every 15th of July, farmers
would hang bad grains

00:11:54.999 --> 00:11:58.208
outside their houses,

00:11:58.375 --> 00:11:59.999
and pray that Houji
would share more wisdom

00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:02.500
on how they can
grow better crops.

00:12:02.667 --> 00:12:05.125
In Hindu myths and legends,

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:07.291
millet grains and fields
were also often mentioned.

00:12:07.458 --> 00:12:11.000
The grain which is
known as ragi in India

00:12:11.166 --> 00:12:14.542
is closely associated with
the Hindu goddess, Kali.

00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:18.999
During festivals
dedicated to Kali,

00:12:18.999 --> 00:12:21.709
citizens of Tamil
Nadu in Southern India

00:12:21.875 --> 00:12:24.999
would make a millet
porridge called Kuzl,

00:12:25.041 --> 00:12:27.999
and would distribute
it for people to eat.

00:12:28.125 --> 00:12:31.458
There are also
mentions of millet

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:33.500
in the chronicles of
Marco Polo's voyages

00:12:33.667 --> 00:12:36.458
specifically how Kublai
Khan and his subjects

00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:39.291
cultivated and consumed
millet regularly.

00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:42.999
In the Hunza Valley
found in the Himalayas,

00:12:43.041 --> 00:12:45.709
resides the Hunza
people called Hunzacuts

00:12:45.875 --> 00:12:49.125
who are known to have
exceptionally long lives

00:12:49.291 --> 00:12:52.125
up to 115 years old.

00:12:52.291 --> 00:12:55.458
Because of this, many
have become interested

00:12:55.625 --> 00:12:57.999
in the Hunzacuts diet
in hope of unlocking

00:12:58.125 --> 00:13:00.999
their secret to longevity.

00:13:00.999 --> 00:13:03.333
Aside from fruits and
vegetables which they eat raw,

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.041
the Hunzacuts basically consumed

00:13:07.208 --> 00:13:09.125
what was abundant
in their region,

00:13:09.291 --> 00:13:11.208
and that is grains
including millet

00:13:11.375 --> 00:13:13.959
which grows efficiently
under the harsh weather

00:13:13.999 --> 00:13:16.333
of the Himalayas.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.750
Since millet production
is now scattered

00:13:18.917 --> 00:13:20.750
across the globe,
different cultures

00:13:20.917 --> 00:13:22.959
have come up with
their own versions

00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:24.999
of millet breads, and porridges.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.208
In India, Roti is
the most famous bread

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:32.583
made from millet.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.083
The Indians also grind
millet to produce flour

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.125
which they mix with milk
and yogurt to make porridge.

00:13:37.291 --> 00:13:41.166
In Sri Lanka, finger
millet is called kurakkan,

00:13:42.625 --> 00:13:46.125
and they add coconut to
their version of Roti.

00:13:46.291 --> 00:13:49.583
Millet is also boiled
in salted water

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.125
to make a dough called thalapa

00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:54.500
which is eaten along
with meat curry.

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:57.500
In Vietnam, finger millet
has a very interesting

00:13:57.667 --> 00:14:00.458
medicinal use.

00:14:00.625 --> 00:14:02.041
Because of its high
calcium and iron content,

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:05.083
it is given to women
after they give birth

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.999
to help their body replenish
its calcium and iron levels.

00:14:07.999 --> 00:14:11.999
Millet is also used
to make wine or beer.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.792
In Taiwain, before
Taiwanese millet wines

00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:18.375
were exported abroad,

00:14:18.542 --> 00:14:19.999
it was primarily homemade

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:21.999
especially by the
Aboriginal tribes of Taiwan,

00:14:21.999 --> 00:14:24.999
and used only during
special occasions

00:14:25.083 --> 00:14:27.709
such as weddings.

00:14:27.875 --> 00:14:29.625
Other alcoholic drinks
made from fermented millet

00:14:29.792 --> 00:14:32.625
are Rakshi from Napal,

00:14:32.792 --> 00:14:34.667
and Ajono from East Africa

00:14:34.834 --> 00:14:36.999
which is drank using straws.

00:14:37.041 --> 00:14:39.625
Millet's diverse influences
throughout history

00:14:43.375 --> 00:14:46.333
only prove that
it's a powerhouse

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.375
of wonders and wisdom.

00:14:48.542 --> 00:14:50.667
As the world
continues to evolve,

00:14:50.834 --> 00:14:53.125
who knows what other wonders

00:14:53.291 --> 00:14:54.709
will be discovered using millet.

00:14:54.875 --> 00:14:57.542
Today, more and more
efforts to eradicate hunger

00:15:20.709 --> 00:15:24.333
and malnutrition
around the globe

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.291
are being implemented.

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:28.917
International and
non-profit organizations

00:15:43.999 --> 00:15:46.834
along with different
government agencies

00:15:46.999 --> 00:15:49.041
are more proactive than ever

00:15:49.208 --> 00:15:51.041
in researching and conducting
feasibility studies

00:15:51.208 --> 00:15:53.999
to determine other
ways of improving

00:15:54.041 --> 00:15:56.458
the world's nutrition.

00:15:56.625 --> 00:15:58.291
The ancient grains
of millet are playing

00:16:08.583 --> 00:16:10.709
a key role in these researches.

00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:13.667
India and China are
the top two producers

00:16:19.125 --> 00:16:21.999
of millet in the world.

00:16:22.083 --> 00:16:24.583
Based on the 2010 data

00:16:28.709 --> 00:16:30.375
of the International
Crops Research Institute

00:16:30.542 --> 00:16:32.999
for the Semi-Arid Tropics,

00:16:32.999 --> 00:16:34.999
India produced over 9
million metric tons,

00:16:35.083 --> 00:16:38.709
and China follows
at 1.3 million.

00:16:38.875 --> 00:16:42.083
India may be the
number one producer,

00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:47.250
but ironically, the
country saw a decline

00:16:47.417 --> 00:16:50.208
in production and
consumption of millet

00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:52.625
these past years.

00:16:52.792 --> 00:16:54.750
According to a report
presented in 2012

00:16:56.625 --> 00:16:59.125
by Dawn Foundation,

00:16:59.291 --> 00:17:01.000
the contributing factors
to this decline include

00:17:01.166 --> 00:17:04.375
the lack of modern technologies

00:17:05.667 --> 00:17:07.917
to ease production and
post-harvest processes,

00:17:07.999 --> 00:17:10.999
the shifting preference
of the public

00:17:13.208 --> 00:17:14.917
to rice and wheat,

00:17:14.999 --> 00:17:16.917
and the overall minimal support

00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:19.792
in promoting millet
as a health food.

00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:22.709
While millet is
abundant in India,

00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:28.208
it is, however, not
included in the government's

00:17:28.375 --> 00:17:30.583
Public Distribution
System in the past years.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:34.375
The Public Distribution
System, or PDS,

00:17:37.208 --> 00:17:39.999
is a food security system

00:17:40.083 --> 00:17:41.999
that subsidizes the
poor communities

00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:44.542
with basic commodities
such as rice,

00:17:44.709 --> 00:17:47.125
wheat, kerosene, and sugar.

00:17:47.291 --> 00:17:50.834
Fortunately in 2013, the
National Food Security Bill

00:17:52.999 --> 00:17:56.999
was signed into law,

00:17:57.041 --> 00:17:58.999
and millet is finally
among the grain crops

00:17:58.999 --> 00:18:01.417
to be distributed along
with wheat and rice.

00:18:01.583 --> 00:18:05.250
Millet is also a
participant in various

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.959
biofortification projects.

00:18:12.999 --> 00:18:15.291
Biofortification is
a process wherein

00:18:15.458 --> 00:18:18.333
a crop's nutrients are enhanced

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.583
either through conventional

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:22.458
or modern breeding techniques.

00:18:22.625 --> 00:18:24.917
Most crops are fortified
with iron, zinc,

00:18:24.999 --> 00:18:28.999
and Vitamin A.

00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:31.875
In a report published by
the Journal of Nutrition

00:18:34.999 --> 00:18:37.375
in 2013, test subjects
from feeding programs

00:18:37.542 --> 00:18:41.208
conducted in Africa and Asia,

00:18:41.375 --> 00:18:43.875
absorbed two to
three times more iron

00:18:43.999 --> 00:18:46.166
from iron biofortified
pearl millet

00:18:46.333 --> 00:18:49.083
than from the regular millet.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.999
The results are promising

00:18:53.542 --> 00:18:54.999
especially in combating
iron deficiency and anemia

00:18:54.999 --> 00:18:58.625
which contribute to
impaired mental development

00:18:58.792 --> 00:19:01.250
among children, and
increase the risk

00:19:01.417 --> 00:19:03.625
of mortality among
pregnant women

00:19:03.792 --> 00:19:05.999
particularly in
developing countries.

00:19:06.125 --> 00:19:08.999
Biofortification projects
are now being conducted

00:19:16.542 --> 00:19:19.875
around the globe by
international research

00:19:19.999 --> 00:19:22.291
and health organizations.

00:19:22.458 --> 00:19:25.083
Traditional ways of cultivating

00:19:35.999 --> 00:19:37.250
and enjoying millet will remain,

00:19:37.417 --> 00:19:39.834
but consideration of
modern production methods

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.250
and applications of
the grain is necessary

00:19:45.417 --> 00:19:47.999
to unleash millet's
other potentials

00:19:47.999 --> 00:19:50.208
in nutrition and health.

00:19:50.375 --> 00:19:52.750
The ancient grain millet
remains to be a staple food crop

00:20:20.999 --> 00:20:24.583
especially for around 90 million
people in Africa and Asia.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:29.583
Certain millet varieties
are widely made

00:20:29.834 --> 00:20:31.999
into porridge,
flatbreads, pilafs,

00:20:32.041 --> 00:20:34.999
cookies, and beverages.

00:20:34.999 --> 00:20:37.750
Millet's taste
and texture varies

00:20:37.917 --> 00:20:39.709
depending on the preparation
and cooking methods.

00:20:39.875 --> 00:20:42.999
To enjoy a fluffy
and creamy texture,

00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:45.750
simply cook millet
in boiling water

00:20:45.917 --> 00:20:48.333
using the conventional
ratio one is to three;

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.667
one cup of millet to
three cups of liquid.

00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:54.458
Cooking time ranges
from 20 to 30 minutes.

00:20:54.625 --> 00:20:58.291
For a nuttier flavor,
first roast the grains

00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:00.875
on a skillet over medium heat

00:21:00.999 --> 00:21:02.834
until they're golden brown

00:21:02.999 --> 00:21:04.417
before cooking them
in boiling water.

00:21:04.583 --> 00:21:07.125
Always remember to
thoroughly rinse the grains

00:21:07.291 --> 00:21:09.999
before cooking them.

00:21:09.999 --> 00:21:11.917
Here are two recipes you can try

00:21:11.999 --> 00:21:13.917
that will surely
excite your palate.

00:21:13.999 --> 00:21:16.917
The first is Millet
with Spicy Tomato Soup.

00:21:16.999 --> 00:21:20.417
For this recipe, you will
need one cup of millet,

00:21:20.583 --> 00:21:23.999
one teaspoon of salt, and
three to four cups of water

00:21:23.999 --> 00:21:27.667
to cook the millet.

00:21:27.834 --> 00:21:29.875
While for the Tomato Soup,

00:21:29.999 --> 00:21:31.999
you will need one kilogram
of chopped tomatoes,

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:34.999
one large chopped onion,

00:21:35.083 --> 00:21:37.166
two dashes each of
ground cinnamon,

00:21:37.333 --> 00:21:39.041
and ground cloves,

00:21:39.208 --> 00:21:40.750
one teaspoon of ground cumin,

00:21:40.917 --> 00:21:43.250
one-half teaspoon
of chili powder,

00:21:43.417 --> 00:21:45.792
one-half teaspoon of
salt, black pepper,

00:21:45.959 --> 00:21:48.792
two tablespoons of olive oil,

00:21:48.959 --> 00:21:50.875
one tablespoon of chopped
fresh basil leaves,

00:21:50.999 --> 00:21:53.999
and two tablespoons of
toasted pumpkin seeds.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.750
Start by putting the salt
and water in a saucepan,

00:21:59.999 --> 00:22:03.208
and cooking the millet
for 25 to 30 minutes.

00:22:03.375 --> 00:22:06.917
Next, in a large skillet,
combine the chopped tomatoes,

00:22:06.999 --> 00:22:10.750
chopped onion, ground
cinnamon, ground cloves,

00:22:10.917 --> 00:22:14.792
ground cumin,
chili powder, salt,

00:22:14.959 --> 00:22:18.999
black pepper, and olive oil.

00:22:19.041 --> 00:22:21.333
Cook over medium heat
while stirring frequently

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.999
until everything is
soft, about 12 minutes.

00:22:24.999 --> 00:22:28.709
Then to serve,
transfer the millet

00:22:28.875 --> 00:22:30.999
to a serving bowl,
and simply pour

00:22:31.041 --> 00:22:33.417
the tomato sauce on top.

00:22:33.583 --> 00:22:36.083
Garnish with basil
and pumpkin seeds.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.999
The second recipe is a fun snack

00:22:41.542 --> 00:22:43.625
called Millet and Basil Patties.

00:22:43.792 --> 00:22:46.792
Just prepare the following:

00:22:46.959 --> 00:22:48.917
three-quarters cups
of foxtail millet,

00:22:48.999 --> 00:22:51.834
one and three-quarters
cups of water,

00:22:51.999 --> 00:22:54.709
one-half cup of chopped basil,

00:22:54.875 --> 00:22:57.917
two cloves of grated garlic,

00:22:57.999 --> 00:23:00.208
one medium chopped onion,

00:23:00.375 --> 00:23:02.208
one-half cup of bread crumbs,

00:23:02.375 --> 00:23:04.583
one-half cup of grated cheddar,

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.542
one-half teaspoon of
ground black pepper,

00:23:06.709 --> 00:23:09.750
one teaspoon of salt,

00:23:09.917 --> 00:23:12.500
and two tablespoons
of olive oil.

00:23:12.667 --> 00:23:15.458
Boil the millet in the water.

00:23:15.625 --> 00:23:17.709
When it's cooked,
transfer to a mixing bowl,

00:23:17.875 --> 00:23:20.333
and then mash it with a spoon.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.834
Once it's cooled, add all
the other ingredients,

00:23:22.999 --> 00:23:25.750
and using your fingers mix well

00:23:25.917 --> 00:23:28.208
until everything is
evenly incorporated.

00:23:28.375 --> 00:23:31.291
Shape the mixture into
six to eight balls.

00:23:31.458 --> 00:23:34.333
Flatten them using your palm.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.333
Then fry the patties
in a hot non-stick pan.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.083
Cook each side
until golden brown,

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:42.583
and then serve with
ketchup, or marinara sauce.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.999
Some varieties of
millet are currently

00:23:52.417 --> 00:23:54.208
just used as fodder and silage,

00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:57.291
but hopefully further researches

00:23:57.458 --> 00:23:59.250
in millet's
nutritional composition

00:23:59.417 --> 00:24:01.500
will result in
increased market demand,

00:24:01.667 --> 00:24:04.083
and human consumption
throughout the globe.
