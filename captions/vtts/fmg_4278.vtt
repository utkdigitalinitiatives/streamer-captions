00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.999
<br/>

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.999
Channel Nine, Harmony<br/>
Alliance, KCP&L, the

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:36.999
Anti-Defamation League,<br/>
McDonald's, and IBM present

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:38.999
Dancing In Moccasins.<br/>

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:42.999
<br/>

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.709
When it comes to this country's<br/>
1.5 million American

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:49.667
Indians, there is a mystique, a<br/>
sense of intrigue, a shroud

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:50.999
of mystery that is<br/>
unlike the aura

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.999
surrounding any other minority.<br/>

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:57.999
They have lived and maintained<br/>
a sense of pride and dignity,

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:00.999
despite a history of near<br/>
annihilation, the humility of

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:03.667
being stereotyped, and the<br/>
agony of being forced to

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:06.999
accept a value system which<br/>
is not their own.

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:09.999
Tonight, you can meet some of<br/>
these people, find out where

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:12.999
they get their resilience,<br/>
as we look at people

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:14.250
who Dance in Moccasins.<br/>

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:23.999
<br/>

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:27.999
I know every one of those songs<br/>
that is rendered belongs

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:31.125
to a very important person.<br/>

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:35.999
And with that, I dance with<br/>
respect to every song.

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:40.999
<br/>

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:43.999
It makes you real happy and<br/>
proud that you're an Indian.

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:50.167
<br/>

00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:53.042
Used to be a long time, they<br/>
used to fight one another.

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:55.999
Now different tribes, now<br/>
they get together

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.999
and pow-wow and celebrate.<br/>

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:01.999
<br/>

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.999
To understand why they<br/>
celebrate, you have to look

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.999
into their past to see who they<br/>
are, where they've been.

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.999
To see what it's like dancing<br/>
in moccasins.

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.999
Each nation has a different<br/>
story, but you might find that

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:18.083
collectively, they celebrate the<br/>
preservation of a way of

00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:20.999
life as much as life itself.<br/>

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:24.999
To make sense of that, we went<br/>
to the Kickapoo Reservation to

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.999
talk to Paul Guiseppe, a tribal<br/>
elder who is well

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.999
respected because he<br/>
has seen a lot.

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.999
At one time, this whole<br/>
continent, the United States,

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.667
was our country.<br/>

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:40.999
It was taken away from us.<br/>

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.999
We was forced to go on.<br/>

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:48.999
Like my people, they had come<br/>
from round the Great Lakes.

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:53.999
And when we were one nation, one<br/>
tongue called Algonquin.

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.999
The land that was their<br/>
livelihood.

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:00.959
Their's is and was an ecological<br/>
approach to life,

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.999
designed to bring man in<br/>
harmony with nature.

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:06.999
In one person's words,<br/>
the earth is

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:08.999
alive, a living organism.<br/>

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:13.083
Streams of water are her blood,<br/>
the rocks her skeleton,

00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:17.999
the winds her breath, the<br/>
topsoil her skin.

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:21.167
And the Indians felt if treated<br/>
right, it would take

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:22.834
care of them.<br/>

00:03:22.834 --> 00:03:25.999
We had the game, and everything<br/>
was here.

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:29.999
They called it The Paradise,<br/>
until the white man came and

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:33.250
expansion got underway.<br/>

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.999
I've been told by my elders<br/>
what they've done to them,

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:38.999
it's not in history.<br/>

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:44.334
Them things are not<br/>
in the history.

00:03:44.334 --> 00:03:46.999
But today I think about it.<br/>

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:48.542
I don't even like to<br/>
talk about it.

00:03:48.542 --> 00:03:51.167
You don't have to be Kickapoo<br/>
to understand.

00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:57.667
This country is built on<br/>
aggression, wars, fight,

00:03:57.667 --> 00:04:03.334
battles, and they even gave<br/>
it a name, massacres.

00:04:03.334 --> 00:04:05.999
The Kickapoo stemmed<br/>
from the Algonquin

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:07.584
the Great Lakes region.<br/>

00:04:07.584 --> 00:04:10.999
Forced to move from that area,<br/>
they and the Pottawatomie, a

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:13.999
neighboring tribe, were pushed<br/>
to Wisconsin, Illinois,

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:15.999
Indiana, and Missouri.<br/>

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:18.999
As they fought to maintain their<br/>
place in nature amid a

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:22.999
disappearing forest, leveled by<br/>
white settlers who wanted

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:24.999
land for farming and<br/>
agriculture.

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:27.999
My people was from the start,<br/>
from the beginning, were

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:29.375
peaceful people.<br/>

00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:33.999
They would not kill anyone.<br/>

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:37.542
But as they were pushed and<br/>
pushed, it made them angry,

00:04:37.542 --> 00:04:40.999
mad, and they were the<br/>
warlords of this

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:43.999
country at one time.<br/>

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:48.999
And then the white man<br/>
called us savage.

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:50.626
He's the one's that's savage.<br/>

00:04:50.626 --> 00:04:51.999
He invaded this country.<br/>

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:55.999
He discovered but he invaded<br/>
it, took over the whole

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:59.999
country today, put us on what<br/>
they call reservation.

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:04.250
To tell you the fact of it is,<br/>
these reservations are

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.999
something like Fort<br/>
Leavenworth.

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:09.999
Outgunned, outnumbered, and<br/>
facing a diminishing food

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:13.999
supply, within an 18 year period<br/>
the Indians lost 48

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:16.999
million acres of the land<br/>
they called home.

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:18.999
They just kept pushing them<br/>
and forcing them.

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:22.999
In 1940, the Kickapoo came to<br/>
Kansas with a government

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:27.876
promise that they could stay on<br/>
768,000 acres of land, as

00:05:27.876 --> 00:05:29.999
long as the tribe remained<br/>
a tribe.

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:32.083
That treaty was broken.<br/>

00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:34.999
Eight years later, their<br/>
land was reduced.

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:38.999
All but 150,000 acres was sold<br/>
to the US government

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:41.999
for $0.49 an acre.<br/>

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:45.999
In 1877, the land base became<br/>
even smaller as the government

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:47.999
forced the tribe to split<br/>
its property among

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:49.999
individuals of the tribe.<br/>

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:54.999
The chief got 320 acres, the<br/>
head of each household got 160

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:57.999
acres, and everyone<br/>
else received 40.

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:00.999
The rest was sold to Pike's<br/>
Peak Railroad

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:03.999
for $1.25 an acre.<br/>

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:06.999
But it isn't the loss of<br/>
land that hurts most.

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:09.999
I didn't like the way they<br/>
treated my people.

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:14.999
They treated them like dogs and<br/>
cattle, or herd of cattle.

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:19.999
The old couldn't make the trips,<br/>
well the government

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:21.999
soldiers shot them.<br/>

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:26.999
Shot the old people and the<br/>
ladies that had babies

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:30.751
carrying them, they shot them<br/>
like people and they just--

00:06:30.751 --> 00:06:31.999
I don't know.<br/>

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:33.999
I really hate to<br/>
talk about it.

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:38.709
It makes me mad in my<br/>
mind and my heart.

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:41.542
Estimates show battles between<br/>
white settlers and other

00:06:41.542 --> 00:06:44.999
Indians killed off 2/3 of the<br/>
Kickapoo and the Pottawatomie

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:47.792
between the 18th and<br/>
20th centuries.

00:06:47.792 --> 00:06:49.999
And even worse, the<br/>
tribe split.

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:53.999
Some moved to Oklahoma, others<br/>
eventually went to Mexico.

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:56.999
All of them faced hard times.<br/>

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:58.999
The Europeans thought<br/>
of them as savages.

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:01.792
And in addition to taking their<br/>
land, they wanted to

00:07:01.792 --> 00:07:04.999
civilize the Indians, make<br/>
them more American.

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:06.999
Children were the target,<br/>
and religion and

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:09.209
education their methods.<br/>

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:18.042
I got it from the adults, the<br/>
teachers that the Indian was a

00:07:18.042 --> 00:07:20.999
backward way, was paganistic,<br/>
all negative

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:25.083
kinds of, to me, thoughts.<br/>

00:07:25.083 --> 00:07:27.999
<br/>

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:32.999
So I tried to block them out of<br/>
my mind, and tried to pick

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:38.792
up what it was they were<br/>
trying to teach me.

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:41.999
<br/>

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:49.999
And so I made good grades,<br/>
because that was--

00:07:49.999 --> 00:07:53.999
I guess I always thought<br/>
education was my

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:57.999
only way out of here.<br/>

00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:06.751
I know my parents sacrificed a<br/>
lot for us to go to school.

00:08:06.751 --> 00:08:09.999
Dwindling government funding for<br/>
schools on reservations,

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:13.999
and increased money for off<br/>
reservation boarding schools

00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:16.999
pushed many Pottawatomie and<br/>
Kickapoo young people out of

00:08:16.999 --> 00:08:19.999
their closely knit tribal and<br/>
family life and into the

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:23.459
boarding schools of places<br/>
like Lawrence, Kansas and

00:08:23.459 --> 00:08:25.584
Genoa, Nebraska.<br/>

00:08:25.584 --> 00:08:28.999
There the children were lined<br/>
up, scrubbed, given an

00:08:28.999 --> 00:08:32.999
American name, a haircut, and<br/>
a uniform, and told to leave

00:08:32.999 --> 00:08:34.999
their Indian culture behind.<br/>

00:08:34.999 --> 00:08:38.999
A lot of cases, a lot of tribes<br/>
became extinct because

00:08:38.999 --> 00:08:40.999
they lost their language.<br/>

00:08:40.999 --> 00:08:42.999
They began to lose<br/>
their culture.

00:08:42.999 --> 00:08:44.999
Everyone learned the three Rs.<br/>

00:08:44.999 --> 00:08:46.999
Women learned to sew and cook.<br/>

00:08:46.999 --> 00:08:50.999
And men learned the trades of<br/>
blacksmiths and carpenters.

00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:52.999
There are stories of beatings<br/>
for those who

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:54.999
tried to run away.<br/>

00:08:54.999 --> 00:08:57.999
Those who stayed were forced<br/>
to accept Christianity, but

00:08:57.999 --> 00:09:00.999
many held tight to<br/>
Indian ways.

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:02.999
There was nothing<br/>
like my home.

00:09:02.999 --> 00:09:06.999
I wanted to hear the voice and<br/>
the language and the drum and

00:09:06.999 --> 00:09:10.999
the gourd, or whatever it<br/>
might what we used.

00:09:10.999 --> 00:09:12.751
I miss those things.<br/>

00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:15.999
In the Kickapoo faith, it is<br/>
Wisaka that created the world

00:09:15.999 --> 00:09:17.999
and named everything in it.<br/>

00:09:17.999 --> 00:09:20.999
He made the Kickapoo, taught<br/>
them their way of life, how to

00:09:20.999 --> 00:09:23.999
build their houses, and which<br/>
materials to use.

00:09:23.999 --> 00:09:26.999
He also taught them how to dance<br/>
and perform religious

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:28.999
ceremonies, and he<br/>
gave them bundles

00:09:28.999 --> 00:09:30.999
containing sacred objects.<br/>

00:09:30.999 --> 00:09:34.999
It was his father, Kechi Muneto,<br/>
who created everything

00:09:34.999 --> 00:09:37.999
in the universe except<br/>
for this world.

00:09:37.999 --> 00:09:42.999
And Indian way's a god's<br/>
way of worshiping.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:48.999
It's not man made, it's was All<br/>
Mighty, the Supreme Being

00:09:48.999 --> 00:09:51.125
who gave it to us.<br/>

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:54.999
Some say it is their religion,<br/>
their beliefs, their

00:09:54.999 --> 00:09:58.999
Indianness that has kept their<br/>
culture alive until this date.

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:01.834
When we come back, we will<br/>
travel to reservations around

00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:04.999
the country to see what life is<br/>
like today, as we look at

00:10:04.999 --> 00:10:07.999
some of the people who are still<br/>
Dancing in Moccasins.

00:10:07.999 --> 00:10:24.709
<br/>

00:10:24.709 --> 00:10:28.999
It is 1989, and this is<br/>
the rugged desert of

00:10:28.999 --> 00:10:30.999
Northeastern Arizona.<br/>

00:10:30.999 --> 00:10:32.999
It's the kind of place<br/>
most people shun.

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:35.999
At the same time, it's the kind<br/>
of place many American

00:10:35.999 --> 00:10:40.334
Indians dream about, a place<br/>
that offers the ability to

00:10:40.334 --> 00:10:44.999
live off the land and be<br/>
in harmony with nature.

00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:47.999
But there is an underlying<br/>
nightmare created by what the

00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:51.834
Indians see as the white<br/>
man, the US government.

00:10:51.834 --> 00:10:54.999
Like you can't sleep, you<br/>
can't eat, and all that.

00:10:54.999 --> 00:10:59.999
You just got to think about what<br/>
they're going to do next.

00:10:59.999 --> 00:11:04.292
16 years ago, Congress divided<br/>
2 million acres of land among

00:11:04.292 --> 00:11:07.999
the Hopi and Navajo living<br/>
in that area.

00:11:07.999 --> 00:11:10.584
But when the boundary lines<br/>
were drawn, little if any

00:11:10.584 --> 00:11:13.999
consideration was given to<br/>
people staying on the land.

00:11:13.999 --> 00:11:21.999
We feel that the United States<br/>
government has not recognized

00:11:21.999 --> 00:11:26.250
the human rights, the human<br/>
dignity of these people that

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.999
are facing relocation.<br/>

00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:30.999
The government is forcing<br/>
each tribe to relocate

00:11:30.999 --> 00:11:32.999
into its own territory.<br/>

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:34.083
This is not my law.<br/>

00:11:34.083 --> 00:11:38.999
The Indians object, and they are<br/>
protesting loud and long,

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:39.999
but peacefully.<br/>

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:43.834
<br/>

00:11:43.834 --> 00:11:45.999
The Navajo do not<br/>
want to move.

00:11:45.999 --> 00:11:48.999
It would mean leaving their<br/>
homeland and Big Mountain, a

00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:51.999
place that is sacred to them,<br/>
because many of their

00:11:51.999 --> 00:11:54.250
ancestors are buried there.<br/>

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.083
This is a territorial battle,<br/>
one many American Indians know

00:11:58.083 --> 00:12:03.459
about firsthand because of bouts<br/>
on their reservations.

00:12:03.459 --> 00:12:06.751
Some old enough to know say<br/>
it is reminiscent of what

00:12:06.751 --> 00:12:09.999
happened more than<br/>
a century ago.

00:12:09.999 --> 00:12:13.542
In the Dairy State, during the<br/>
predawn hours, it's against

00:12:13.542 --> 00:12:16.999
the peaceful backdrop of just<br/>
about any upper Wisconsin lake

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:20.999
that you find protests<br/>
every year.

00:12:20.999 --> 00:12:24.501
These are townspeople protesting<br/>
against a treaty

00:12:24.501 --> 00:12:27.709
that allows the Chippewa Indians<br/>
to spear fish year

00:12:27.709 --> 00:12:31.417
round, and bring in as much as<br/>
they can catch, as long as

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:34.999
they don't interfere with<br/>
nature's replenishing process.

00:12:34.999 --> 00:12:37.999
Police are taking us in for<br/>
crossing a line in a public

00:12:37.999 --> 00:12:41.876
boat dock, because there are<br/>
some Indians spearing up here

00:12:41.876 --> 00:12:43.999
that have more rights<br/>
than anybody else

00:12:43.999 --> 00:12:45.999
in the United States.<br/>

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:48.000
The Indians say they<br/>
deserve to go.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.999
I blame the governor for not<br/>
getting rid of these people in

00:12:51.999 --> 00:12:53.999
the exercise, the legitimate<br/>
exercise of

00:12:53.999 --> 00:12:54.999
the Chippewa's rights.<br/>

00:12:54.999 --> 00:13:00.999
This is condoning, inciting<br/>
violence, and you're virtually

00:13:00.999 --> 00:13:03.999
sitting on a powder keg.<br/>

00:13:03.999 --> 00:13:06.792
Spear fishing is the livelihood<br/>
of the Chippewa.

00:13:06.792 --> 00:13:08.000
It's their main source<br/>
of food.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.918
<br/>

00:13:12.918 --> 00:13:15.417
The catch is spread among people<br/>
of the reservation.

00:13:15.417 --> 00:13:19.834
Protesters in cold weather<br/>
made the 1989 bounty fall

00:13:19.834 --> 00:13:23.999
short of the goal of 48,000<br/>
fish, only 16,000

00:13:23.999 --> 00:13:24.999
were brought in.<br/>

00:13:24.999 --> 00:13:27.999
It's a small percentage of the<br/>
lake's yield, yet protesters

00:13:27.999 --> 00:13:29.959
lined the docks.<br/>

00:13:29.959 --> 00:13:31.999
They're afraid the Indians<br/>
will deplete the fish

00:13:31.999 --> 00:13:33.999
population and send tourists<br/>
elsewhere.

00:13:33.999 --> 00:13:35.999
So they chant.<br/>

00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:39.999
Goodbye Hopi, goodbye Hopi.<br/>

00:13:39.999 --> 00:13:40.999
And they sing.<br/>

00:13:40.999 --> 00:13:40.999
[SINGING]<br/>

00:13:40.999 --> 00:13:51.999
Land where my fathers died, land<br/>
of the pilgrim's pride.

00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:54.999
Ironically, it's a song the<br/>
Indians could sing too,

00:13:54.999 --> 00:13:56.999
because it's freedom<br/>
they want.

00:13:56.999 --> 00:14:03.751
<br/>

00:14:03.751 --> 00:14:05.999
At the foothills of the Smokies<br/>
on the Cherokee

00:14:05.999 --> 00:14:09.999
Reservation in North Carolina,<br/>
it's higher paying jobs the

00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:11.999
American Indians there want.<br/>

00:14:11.999 --> 00:14:14.999
According to non-Indian<br/>
standards, they are among the

00:14:14.999 --> 00:14:17.999
most developed nations, with<br/>
elected officials, law

00:14:17.999 --> 00:14:20.999
enforcement, a fire department,<br/>
and medical

00:14:20.999 --> 00:14:22.375
facilities.<br/>

00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:25.999
They exist as a sovereign<br/>
nation, but their livelihood

00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:28.999
depends on the money of tourists<br/>
passing through the

00:14:28.999 --> 00:14:30.334
reservation .<br/>

00:14:30.334 --> 00:14:33.999
There is some light industry<br/>
on the reservation.

00:14:33.999 --> 00:14:36.999
A moccasin factory supplies<br/>
shops with souvenirs, and

00:14:36.999 --> 00:14:39.999
people with jobs.<br/>

00:14:39.999 --> 00:14:41.999
Well, it's just a job.<br/>

00:14:41.999 --> 00:14:43.999
Jobs are so hard nowadays,<br/>
you have to hang

00:14:43.999 --> 00:14:45.083
on to what you get.<br/>

00:14:45.083 --> 00:14:47.999
But still, it isn't enough<br/>
for the young.

00:14:47.999 --> 00:14:51.209
I plan on getting away<br/>
from here soon.

00:14:51.209 --> 00:14:55.999
Move to some money<br/>
making area.

00:14:55.999 --> 00:14:59.999
The most recent census figures<br/>
show there are 278 Indian

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:03.501
reservations located within the<br/>
United States, each with

00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:06.999
their own problems.<br/>
Anthropologists say the

00:15:06.999 --> 00:15:09.999
Kickapoo Reservation near Kansas<br/>
City is probably one of

00:15:09.999 --> 00:15:10.999
the most typical.<br/>

00:15:10.999 --> 00:15:13.999
Here at the Kickapoo<br/>
Reservation, the fight today

00:15:13.999 --> 00:15:14.999
is for jobs.<br/>

00:15:14.999 --> 00:15:17.999
Many of the young people have<br/>
to leave the area because of

00:15:17.999 --> 00:15:20.999
the lack of employment, and the<br/>
need for more development.

00:15:20.999 --> 00:15:23.999
US government budget cuts have<br/>
left broken windows and

00:15:23.999 --> 00:15:27.999
boarded businesses scattered<br/>
throughout the reservation.

00:15:27.999 --> 00:15:30.999
But a seven member tribal<br/>
council the Kickapoo elected

00:15:30.999 --> 00:15:33.999
to govern its people is<br/>
working for change.

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:35.999
Tribal manager Fred<br/>
Thomas says,

00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:38.125
it's a matter of survival.<br/>

00:15:38.125 --> 00:15:41.999
Because of the present trend by<br/>
the federal government, I

00:15:41.999 --> 00:15:47.999
see the tribe being pressured<br/>
to enter into agreement with

00:15:47.999 --> 00:15:53.999
the state of Kansas<br/>
or program funds.

00:15:53.999 --> 00:15:59.999
And if that would happen, I<br/>
don't think the reservation

00:15:59.999 --> 00:16:01.999
would exist under state law.<br/>

00:16:01.999 --> 00:16:04.999
To no avail, this sign<br/>
has stood for nine

00:16:04.999 --> 00:16:06.999
years looking for help.<br/>

00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:09.999
The Kickapoo want to<br/>
be self sufficient.

00:16:09.999 --> 00:16:12.999
We wouldn't say no to anything<br/>
that wants to come in.

00:16:12.999 --> 00:16:15.999
I think we'd look at it, and<br/>
right now we're looking at

00:16:15.999 --> 00:16:21.999
employment for the people, and<br/>
if we can help them out, then

00:16:21.999 --> 00:16:23.999
we help ourselves.<br/>

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:26.999
It was a drive for independence<br/>
10 years ago

00:16:26.999 --> 00:16:29.999
under the Self Determination<br/>
Act that the Kickapoo built

00:16:29.999 --> 00:16:34.999
this water treatment plant,<br/>
which employs two people.

00:16:34.999 --> 00:16:38.417
The $1.5 million facility is<br/>
one of their most prized

00:16:38.417 --> 00:16:39.999
possession.<br/>

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:42.000
It pumps water from the Delaware<br/>
River into the

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.999
reservation.<br/>

00:16:43.999 --> 00:16:50.999
Many Indian tribes have an<br/>
agreement or a situation with

00:16:50.999 --> 00:16:54.999
nearby communities or municipal<br/>
operations where the

00:16:54.999 --> 00:16:56.999
water is piped in.<br/>

00:16:56.999 --> 00:17:02.999
But we wanted the responsibility<br/>
and the right

00:17:02.999 --> 00:17:05.999
to take care of our<br/>
own water needs.

00:17:05.999 --> 00:17:09.542
They had to fight the state of<br/>
Kansas to get that right, and

00:17:09.542 --> 00:17:12.334
they used an 1854<br/>
treaty to do so.

00:17:12.334 --> 00:17:15.999
The court decision said the<br/>
Kickapoo were there before

00:17:15.999 --> 00:17:18.999
Kansas was a state, and it<br/>
gave them legal power

00:17:18.999 --> 00:17:20.042
to build the dam.<br/>

00:17:20.042 --> 00:17:22.999
That was just the beginning.<br/>

00:17:22.999 --> 00:17:30.999
I think that what has happened<br/>
in these later years is we've

00:17:30.999 --> 00:17:39.999
had our Kickapoo people who<br/>
have learned, who got an

00:17:39.999 --> 00:17:51.999
education and got some know<br/>
how to operate and develop

00:17:51.999 --> 00:17:55.959
programs, community<br/>
development.

00:17:55.959 --> 00:18:00.999
And we got into a real<br/>
initiative, a real drive for

00:18:00.999 --> 00:18:02.459
self determination.<br/>

00:18:02.459 --> 00:18:05.999
That drive has led the effort to<br/>
build and acquire land for

00:18:05.999 --> 00:18:09.999
the Kickapoo Nation Farm, which<br/>
employs five people, and

00:18:09.999 --> 00:18:13.999
houses eight buffalo and more<br/>
than 200 head of cattle.

00:18:13.999 --> 00:18:16.999
The 3,000 acre facility<br/>
represents just about all of

00:18:16.999 --> 00:18:19.999
the land the tribe now owns.<br/>

00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:23.999
Individual Indians have an<br/>
additional 3,000 acres on the

00:18:23.999 --> 00:18:26.999
19,200 acre reservation.<br/>

00:18:26.999 --> 00:18:28.999
The rest has been sold<br/>
to non-Indians.

00:18:28.999 --> 00:18:33.999
<br/>

00:18:33.999 --> 00:18:36.999
It also led to the purchase of<br/>
heavy equipment used in both

00:18:36.999 --> 00:18:38.999
road and building<br/>
construction.

00:18:38.999 --> 00:18:42.167
Buck Joaquinas does the road<br/>
work, and he's the tribal

00:18:42.167 --> 00:18:43.999
construction foreman.<br/>

00:18:43.999 --> 00:18:45.999
He has a four man crew.<br/>

00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:49.042
The bingo hall was<br/>
built in 1984.

00:18:49.042 --> 00:18:51.999
During the week the place sits<br/>
idle, but Saturday through

00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:54.999
Monday, the place is open to<br/>
the public, and the high

00:18:54.999 --> 00:18:56.999
stakes draw a crowd large<br/>
enough to put

00:18:56.999 --> 00:18:58.999
seven people to work.<br/>

00:18:58.999 --> 00:19:02.999
The bingo hall, the farm, and<br/>
the trading post are major

00:19:02.999 --> 00:19:05.999
employers and sources of income<br/>
on the reservation.

00:19:05.999 --> 00:19:08.999
<br/>

00:19:08.999 --> 00:19:11.999
The gas station slash<br/>
convenience store

00:19:11.999 --> 00:19:13.999
was built in 1977.<br/>

00:19:13.999 --> 00:19:18.999
It closed six years later, but<br/>
was reopened in 1985 and, when

00:19:18.999 --> 00:19:21.999
we were there, there was talk<br/>
of expansion, turning the

00:19:21.999 --> 00:19:24.999
building next door into<br/>
a tire center.

00:19:24.999 --> 00:19:27.999
Mike Mattwaoshe, the manager<br/>
of the store,

00:19:27.999 --> 00:19:28.999
would run the place.<br/>

00:19:28.999 --> 00:19:30.999
The important thing that we<br/>
need right now is jobs out

00:19:30.999 --> 00:19:33.999
here, and that will supply<br/>
at least two more jobs

00:19:33.999 --> 00:19:36.999
for people out here.<br/>

00:19:36.999 --> 00:19:43.792
That's the whole idea of trying<br/>
to get jobs, so we can

00:19:43.792 --> 00:19:44.999
more or less progress further<br/>
than where we

00:19:44.999 --> 00:19:47.834
are at right now.<br/>

00:19:47.834 --> 00:19:50.999
The senior citizens home is a<br/>
meeting place for those who've

00:19:50.999 --> 00:19:54.999
been around the longest and seen<br/>
the most. They've watched

00:19:54.999 --> 00:19:55.999
people come and go.<br/>

00:19:55.999 --> 00:19:59.999
The Census Bureau says close<br/>
to 300 live on the

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:00.999
reservation.<br/>

00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:03.999
The Kickapoo say there's<br/>
twice that many.

00:20:03.999 --> 00:20:07.918
Regardless of the number, just<br/>
about everyone maintains

00:20:07.918 --> 00:20:12.999
images of what once was<br/>
and what can be.

00:20:12.999 --> 00:20:14.999
I don't know, we all<br/>
have their own

00:20:14.999 --> 00:20:16.334
tribal pride, I guess.<br/>

00:20:16.334 --> 00:20:18.999
They talk in terms of<br/>
a brighter future.

00:20:18.999 --> 00:20:21.999
Gwen McKinney wants a silk<br/>
screen business.

00:20:21.999 --> 00:20:23.999
It's difficult, because<br/>
I've got no

00:20:23.999 --> 00:20:25.334
money and I'm not working.<br/>

00:20:25.334 --> 00:20:28.999
But I'm going to the Bureau to<br/>
try to get some assistance

00:20:28.999 --> 00:20:31.999
from them, so that I can<br/>
start on a small scale.

00:20:31.999 --> 00:20:34.999
And then as I go, expand.<br/>

00:20:34.999 --> 00:20:37.501
Charlie Holman moved to the<br/>
reservation with his

00:20:37.501 --> 00:20:39.501
wife four years ago.<br/>

00:20:39.501 --> 00:20:41.999
She works in health services.<br/>

00:20:41.999 --> 00:20:43.999
He wishes others were<br/>
that lucky.

00:20:43.999 --> 00:20:46.999
I think that's the primary<br/>
interest, is to increase the

00:20:46.999 --> 00:20:49.999
standard of living.<br/>

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:56.667
And if we had local jobs, I<br/>
think these people here would

00:20:56.667 --> 00:21:01.999
probably really enjoy that,<br/>
because it'd give them

00:21:01.999 --> 00:21:02.999
something to do.<br/>

00:21:02.999 --> 00:21:06.999
The people here know they have<br/>
a roof over their heads, food

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:09.999
on the table, and<br/>
companionship.

00:21:09.999 --> 00:21:12.999
And they say that's enough<br/>
to keep them here.

00:21:12.999 --> 00:21:15.167
To them, it is home.<br/>

00:21:15.167 --> 00:21:18.042
They can worship as they<br/>
please, perform their

00:21:18.042 --> 00:21:23.751
religious ceremonies, and<br/>
be as one with nature.

00:21:23.751 --> 00:21:26.250
People who've lived on the<br/>
reservation say they have more

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.999
than a lot of people.<br/>

00:21:28.999 --> 00:21:33.999
There's a few people I feel<br/>
like they may be poor in

00:21:33.999 --> 00:21:40.999
material things, but in their<br/>
frame of mind, how they think,

00:21:40.999 --> 00:21:43.999
to me they're rich.<br/>

00:21:43.999 --> 00:21:48.999
But there's more people who<br/>
don't feel good about

00:21:48.999 --> 00:21:50.999
themselves, don't know<br/>
what they want or

00:21:50.999 --> 00:21:52.999
where they're going.<br/>

00:21:52.999 --> 00:21:58.292
And there's too many of them.<br/>

00:21:58.292 --> 00:22:01.334
Starting with the young in<br/>
school, they're trying to cut

00:22:01.334 --> 00:22:01.999
that number.<br/>

00:22:01.999 --> 00:22:05.999
The Kickapoo Indian School is<br/>
attended by about half the

00:22:05.999 --> 00:22:06.999
students on the reservation.<br/>

00:22:06.999 --> 00:22:10.999
The others go to either boarding<br/>
or public schools.

00:22:10.999 --> 00:22:14.375
Those at the Indian School say<br/>
students there receive an

00:22:14.375 --> 00:22:17.501
education more sensitive to<br/>
their needs, through what's

00:22:17.501 --> 00:22:19.999
called the circle of learning.<br/>

00:22:19.999 --> 00:22:24.999
I feel like it's very important<br/>
with self concept of

00:22:24.999 --> 00:22:27.999
any children, and particularly<br/>
with Indian children, that we

00:22:27.999 --> 00:22:33.000
need to emphasize their<br/>
importance and the strength

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.999
that they give to being<br/>
included in

00:22:35.999 --> 00:22:37.834
an educational circle.<br/>

00:22:37.834 --> 00:22:40.999
That their ideas are as<br/>
important as anyone else's in

00:22:40.999 --> 00:22:42.999
that circle.<br/>

00:22:42.999 --> 00:22:45.999
Indian culture is also fostered<br/>
through teacher aides

00:22:45.999 --> 00:22:47.999
of Indian descent.<br/>

00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:51.999
Virginia Potts here was our<br/>
resource person to help with

00:22:51.999 --> 00:22:54.999
our K-12 project in art.<br/>

00:22:54.999 --> 00:22:57.999
And she's the one that was<br/>
responsible for teaching the

00:22:57.999 --> 00:22:59.999
moccasin making.<br/>

00:22:59.999 --> 00:23:02.751
This is the high school level,<br/>
this over here at the grade

00:23:02.751 --> 00:23:03.999
school level.<br/>

00:23:03.999 --> 00:23:06.083
She also helped with the<br/>
beading, and we also had two

00:23:06.083 --> 00:23:07.999
other beading people in.<br/>

00:23:07.999 --> 00:23:12.167
She says she helped so the<br/>
craft would not be lost.

00:23:12.167 --> 00:23:17.999
I just want them to learn, to<br/>
carry that on, so they could

00:23:17.999 --> 00:23:21.209
pass it on to the next<br/>
generations, maybe generations

00:23:21.209 --> 00:23:24.459
after the generations.<br/>

00:23:24.459 --> 00:23:29.999
And if not, who's going<br/>
to tell them?

00:23:29.999 --> 00:23:33.999
14 of the 16 teachers at the<br/>
school are not Indian, and

00:23:33.999 --> 00:23:36.959
they say the aid program<br/>
is a must.

00:23:36.959 --> 00:23:40.375
It's hard I think for us to<br/>
understand a lot of it.

00:23:40.375 --> 00:23:41.999
To understand a lot of?<br/>

00:23:41.999 --> 00:23:44.999
The culture and the heritage,<br/>
because I don't

00:23:44.999 --> 00:23:46.999
know much about it.<br/>

00:23:46.999 --> 00:23:49.999
She and other teachers help the<br/>
students learn every day

00:23:49.999 --> 00:23:53.999
life skills, and the subjects<br/>
taught in public schools.

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:57.999
The school is funded and<br/>
monitored by the Bureau of

00:23:57.999 --> 00:23:58.999
Indian Affairs.<br/>

00:23:58.999 --> 00:24:01.999
Tests of sixth graders show they<br/>
are performing just below

00:24:01.999 --> 00:24:05.999
grade level in all subjects<br/>
checked, except spelling,

00:24:05.999 --> 00:24:07.999
where they're well<br/>
above the norm.

00:24:07.999 --> 00:24:10.999
And unlike the students of<br/>
many reservations, the

00:24:10.999 --> 00:24:13.876
Kickapoo do continue<br/>
their education.

00:24:13.876 --> 00:24:15.999
A self study report<br/>
says most go on to

00:24:15.999 --> 00:24:18.667
college or a trade school.<br/>

00:24:18.667 --> 00:24:20.999
Those who go to college<br/>
have to work harder

00:24:20.999 --> 00:24:22.999
according to teachers.<br/>

00:24:22.999 --> 00:24:26.999
There needs to be more<br/>
discipline stressed, I think.

00:24:26.999 --> 00:24:28.999
They have a lot of trouble with<br/>
dealing with homework and

00:24:28.999 --> 00:24:31.999
skills of that nature, and that<br/>
needs to be stressed.

00:24:31.999 --> 00:24:33.999
Because in college, you're<br/>
on your own.

00:24:33.999 --> 00:24:38.709
Because there are only 40 jobs<br/>
on the reservation, most do

00:24:38.709 --> 00:24:40.999
leave, and there is<br/>
concern about them

00:24:40.999 --> 00:24:42.999
losing their heritage.<br/>

00:24:42.999 --> 00:24:46.999
But some say there is a force<br/>
that brings them back.

00:24:46.999 --> 00:24:50.501
When we continue, we will go to<br/>
the city to meet some urban

00:24:50.501 --> 00:24:52.999
Indians who Dance<br/>
in Moccasins.

00:24:52.999 --> 00:25:02.999
<br/>

00:25:02.999 --> 00:25:04.999
At a distance, it looks fine.<br/>

00:25:04.999 --> 00:25:06.999
But what if you decide<br/>
to move in?

00:25:06.999 --> 00:25:09.999
Imagine coming to a<br/>
city, any city.

00:25:09.999 --> 00:25:13.042
You have no ID, you can't drive,<br/>
you know nothing about

00:25:13.042 --> 00:25:14.999
catching a bus or<br/>
using a phone.

00:25:14.999 --> 00:25:16.834
It can be frightening.<br/>

00:25:16.834 --> 00:25:19.999
And that's the case for many<br/>
American Indians who leave

00:25:19.999 --> 00:25:21.999
reservations.<br/>

00:25:21.999 --> 00:25:25.000
Fears are felt even in a town<br/>
the size of Lawrence.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.999
A nurse who works at the Health<br/>
Services Department of

00:25:27.999 --> 00:25:31.584
Haskell Indian Junior College<br/>
knows all too well.

00:25:31.584 --> 00:25:33.501
She left the Kickapoo<br/>
Reservation

00:25:33.501 --> 00:25:34.999
seeking a better life.<br/>

00:25:34.999 --> 00:25:38.999
One of the big things that I<br/>
noticed when I moved off the

00:25:38.999 --> 00:25:45.999
reservation to go to college,<br/>
everybody there

00:25:45.999 --> 00:25:46.999
seemed to have a phone.<br/>

00:25:46.999 --> 00:25:48.999
I never had a phone.<br/>

00:25:48.999 --> 00:25:49.999
I never could afford one.<br/>

00:25:49.999 --> 00:25:50.999
They say, what's your<br/>
phone number?

00:25:50.999 --> 00:25:51.999
I say, I don't have one.<br/>

00:25:51.999 --> 00:25:54.999
She found adjusting to<br/>
a new culture, a new

00:25:54.999 --> 00:25:57.999
society, is not easy.<br/>

00:25:57.999 --> 00:26:01.999
65% of the American Indians<br/>
make the attempt, and it

00:26:01.999 --> 00:26:04.999
doesn't take long for many who<br/>
thought it would be a smooth

00:26:04.999 --> 00:26:06.999
transition to think again.<br/>

00:26:06.999 --> 00:26:10.999
Indians are not filtered<br/>
into society.

00:26:10.999 --> 00:26:14.999
They're just rushed into it,<br/>
they're just forced into it.

00:26:14.999 --> 00:26:18.999
And a KU professor who has<br/>
studied them says, they often

00:26:18.999 --> 00:26:21.999
find dealing with that pressure<br/>
does not provide the

00:26:21.999 --> 00:26:23.999
life they dreamed of.<br/>

00:26:23.999 --> 00:26:27.999
Many American Indians live<br/>
below the poverty line.

00:26:27.999 --> 00:26:33.626
And I believe the statistics<br/>
were Indians not on

00:26:33.626 --> 00:26:40.375
reservations, 22% of them fell<br/>
below the poverty line, as

00:26:40.375 --> 00:26:43.999
compared to 12% of the US<br/>
population in general.

00:26:43.999 --> 00:26:48.999
And that increased to 40%<br/>
for American Indians on

00:26:48.999 --> 00:26:50.999
reservations,<br/>

00:26:50.999 --> 00:26:53.292
The culture shock and the<br/>
disappointment are often too

00:26:53.292 --> 00:26:53.999
much to take.<br/>

00:26:53.999 --> 00:26:57.459
And a large number, nearly twice<br/>
as high as that of the

00:26:57.459 --> 00:27:01.667
general population, choose<br/>
suicide as a way out.

00:27:01.667 --> 00:27:04.999
Jeanette Biggoose says it was a<br/>
feeling of hopelessness that

00:27:04.999 --> 00:27:06.999
nearly did her in.<br/>

00:27:06.999 --> 00:27:10.999
I thought of giving my children<br/>
up, that somebody

00:27:10.999 --> 00:27:12.999
raise them that could<br/>
afford them.

00:27:12.999 --> 00:27:16.999
But that wasn't what I wanted.<br/>

00:27:16.999 --> 00:27:19.999
So I thought of taking<br/>
my life.

00:27:19.999 --> 00:27:25.999
But I couldn't leave them, and<br/>
I couldn't justify taking

00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:27.999
their lives.<br/>

00:27:27.999 --> 00:27:32.999
So the only thing I had to<br/>
do was I went to church.

00:27:32.999 --> 00:27:35.999
I was raised Catholic,<br/>
and I tried to go

00:27:35.999 --> 00:27:37.999
back to Catholic church.<br/>

00:27:37.999 --> 00:27:46.999
Somehow I just couldn't find<br/>
the comfort that I needed.

00:27:46.999 --> 00:27:49.999
<br/>

00:27:49.999 --> 00:27:55.999
So as a last resort, and it was<br/>
from my thinking, that I

00:27:55.999 --> 00:28:00.999
would go back and pray<br/>
with my parents.

00:28:00.999 --> 00:28:07.999
<br/>

00:28:07.999 --> 00:28:10.999
And I came out, so I went<br/>
to church with them.

00:28:10.999 --> 00:28:13.999
<br/>

00:28:13.999 --> 00:28:14.999
And I came out.<br/>

00:28:14.999 --> 00:28:18.999
I was able to laugh, think<br/>
of the future.

00:28:18.999 --> 00:28:21.999
Making adjustments, she was able<br/>
to achieve what came more

00:28:21.999 --> 00:28:22.999
easily to others.<br/>

00:28:22.999 --> 00:28:25.999
As a nurse, she now helps those<br/>
dealing with everything

00:28:25.999 --> 00:28:29.999
from alcoholism to diabetes,<br/>
a disease some say is at

00:28:29.999 --> 00:28:32.999
epidemic proportions among<br/>
American Indians.

00:28:32.999 --> 00:28:35.876
Her insight is important.<br/>

00:28:35.876 --> 00:28:38.999
If you want to heal your spirit,<br/>
you go to church.

00:28:38.999 --> 00:28:41.999
In the Western thinking, if you<br/>
want to heal your body, go

00:28:41.999 --> 00:28:43.999
see a doctor.<br/>

00:28:43.999 --> 00:28:47.999
But amongst the Indians, it's<br/>
hard to separate them.

00:28:47.999 --> 00:28:50.999
The difficulties in the approach<br/>
to medicine cross

00:28:50.999 --> 00:28:52.999
over into other aspects<br/>
of life.

00:28:52.999 --> 00:28:56.999
In a white man's world, you go<br/>
90 miles an hour, and achieve

00:28:56.999 --> 00:28:59.083
the highest and be the status.<br/>

00:28:59.083 --> 00:29:03.125
<br/>

00:29:03.125 --> 00:29:08.999
The ego takes you beyond<br/>
whom you are.

00:29:08.999 --> 00:29:11.918
<br/>

00:29:11.918 --> 00:29:14.999
The ego says fight and<br/>
excel and beat the

00:29:14.999 --> 00:29:17.918
other guy and do better.<br/>

00:29:17.918 --> 00:29:21.999
For some, the cement, bricks,<br/>
mortar, and fast pace of the

00:29:21.999 --> 00:29:23.999
city are too much.<br/>

00:29:23.999 --> 00:29:26.999
To them, the city is simply<br/>
a place to work.

00:29:26.999 --> 00:29:28.375
That's why I'm here.<br/>

00:29:28.375 --> 00:29:35.999
I have a job here, and I try<br/>
to maintain my ties,

00:29:35.999 --> 00:29:44.542
traditional ties and things<br/>
like that, by going home.

00:29:44.542 --> 00:29:48.999
But others make the<br/>
move permanently.

00:29:48.999 --> 00:29:49.999
I wouldn't want to go<br/>
back to reservation.

00:29:49.999 --> 00:29:51.999
No.<br/>

00:29:51.999 --> 00:29:55.999
Unless something really<br/>
bad come up.

00:29:55.999 --> 00:29:58.999
<br/>

00:29:58.999 --> 00:30:01.999
And the worst thing that could<br/>
have happened to me that would

00:30:01.999 --> 00:30:03.999
have made me go back was my<br/>
mother and father, and they

00:30:03.999 --> 00:30:06.542
died and I didn't go home.<br/>

00:30:06.542 --> 00:30:09.999
Such a commitment has its<br/>
dangers, according to those

00:30:09.999 --> 00:30:10.999
raised by the tribal elders.<br/>

00:30:10.999 --> 00:30:13.999
<br/>

00:30:13.999 --> 00:30:16.999
If you're gone, don't<br/>
be gone too long.

00:30:16.999 --> 00:30:20.999
Because once you leave, your<br/>
children's going to lose a

00:30:20.999 --> 00:30:21.999
little bit.<br/>

00:30:21.999 --> 00:30:28.999
And once your children lose<br/>
a little more, the next

00:30:28.999 --> 00:30:32.999
generation will lose a lot<br/>
more, And by the fifth

00:30:32.999 --> 00:30:40.999
generation, this family here in<br/>
that generation do not want

00:30:40.999 --> 00:30:42.999
to be Indians.<br/>

00:30:42.999 --> 00:30:46.250
Right now, Indians seem to have<br/>
to make a choice between

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.999
the city and their culture.<br/>

00:30:48.999 --> 00:30:52.999
Kansas City has a crying<br/>
need for a

00:30:52.999 --> 00:30:56.959
cultural center for Indians.<br/>

00:30:56.959 --> 00:30:58.999
A place that Indians can<br/>
practice their culture and

00:30:58.999 --> 00:31:03.334
spirituality, and<br/>
identify with--

00:31:03.334 --> 00:31:07.999
not just for emergency<br/>
assistance and poverty, but a

00:31:07.999 --> 00:31:11.999
place where they can tell the<br/>
people of the city who they

00:31:11.999 --> 00:31:15.999
are, and a rallying point.<br/>

00:31:15.999 --> 00:31:17.999
They are a courageous people.<br/>

00:31:17.999 --> 00:31:20.999
They have to be to survive.<br/>

00:31:20.999 --> 00:31:26.999
Real typical in that<br/>
I have diabetes.

00:31:26.999 --> 00:31:29.999
Alcoholism runs rampant<br/>
in our family.

00:31:29.999 --> 00:31:34.999
<br/>

00:31:34.999 --> 00:31:38.459
I went to boarding school, which<br/>
a lot of people in my

00:31:38.459 --> 00:31:41.667
generation did.<br/>

00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:44.999
A lot of them are going to<br/>
college and getting married

00:31:44.999 --> 00:31:45.999
and having kids.<br/>

00:31:45.999 --> 00:31:50.999
So I really feel typical, I'm<br/>
not saying I'm not no

00:31:50.999 --> 00:31:53.999
Superwoman, I'm a survivor.<br/>

00:31:53.999 --> 00:31:57.584
When we come back, we will meet<br/>
the next generation of

00:31:57.584 --> 00:31:58.999
urban Indians.<br/>

00:31:58.999 --> 00:32:00.999
They too are survivors.<br/>

00:32:00.999 --> 00:32:05.584
Each has chosen their own path,<br/>
their own way of dancing

00:32:05.584 --> 00:32:06.999
in moccasins.<br/>

00:32:06.999 --> 00:32:16.999
<br/>

00:32:16.999 --> 00:32:20.999
The city is now home to<br/>
several generations of

00:32:20.999 --> 00:32:23.999
American Indians, and some say<br/>
regretfully, they can see a

00:32:23.999 --> 00:32:28.999
scenario the elders warned<br/>
about coming to life.

00:32:28.999 --> 00:32:31.083
You let your tradition and<br/>
heritage go down the drain,

00:32:31.083 --> 00:32:33.834
become a white man.<br/>

00:32:33.834 --> 00:32:34.999
And the next thing you<br/>
know, you don't know

00:32:34.999 --> 00:32:36.999
who you belong to.<br/>

00:32:36.999 --> 00:32:39.999
You don't know who you are.<br/>

00:32:39.999 --> 00:32:42.999
And we have that problem today<br/>
among a lot of the--

00:32:42.999 --> 00:32:46.999
not only Native Americans, but<br/>
the blacks, hispanics, and the

00:32:46.999 --> 00:32:49.999
rest of your generation.<br/>

00:32:49.999 --> 00:32:52.876
Young people are confused,<br/>
according to him.

00:32:52.876 --> 00:32:55.999
They have their feet in both<br/>
worlds, but don't belong to

00:32:55.999 --> 00:32:56.918
either one.<br/>

00:32:56.918 --> 00:33:00.999
And the Indian culture<br/>
is suffering.

00:33:00.999 --> 00:33:03.999
When it comes to losing Indian<br/>
identity, he could have been

00:33:03.999 --> 00:33:06.042
talking about his stepson.<br/>

00:33:06.042 --> 00:33:08.999
I don't have that<br/>
drive that much.

00:33:08.999 --> 00:33:10.999
I'm more I guess integrated.<br/>

00:33:10.999 --> 00:33:13.250
I'm more of a white person<br/>
I guess you'd say.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:15.999
His decision doesn't<br/>
bother everyone.

00:33:15.999 --> 00:33:18.999
Some say for each person who<br/>
abandons their heritage, there

00:33:18.999 --> 00:33:21.999
is another who keeps it alive.<br/>

00:33:21.999 --> 00:33:24.999
In this case, they work<br/>
side by side.

00:33:24.999 --> 00:33:28.959
Michael Noheart is in search<br/>
of his Indian culture.

00:33:28.959 --> 00:33:31.999
A social service agency took him<br/>
and his sister from their

00:33:31.999 --> 00:33:35.292
parents at an early age, and<br/>
gave them to a white family

00:33:35.292 --> 00:33:38.959
the agency felt could provide<br/>
a better life.

00:33:38.959 --> 00:33:40.999
As he grew older, Michael<br/>
found their cultural

00:33:40.999 --> 00:33:43.626
differences were too<br/>
much to handle.

00:33:43.626 --> 00:33:45.334
Just everything seemed like<br/>
it was falling apart.

00:33:45.334 --> 00:33:47.999
So I just bailed out real<br/>
quick and just left.

00:33:47.999 --> 00:33:50.792
Last year he found someone<br/>
who understood an

00:33:50.792 --> 00:33:52.000
emptiness he was feeling.<br/>

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.584
She says she had no choice but<br/>
to help him find his family.

00:33:56.584 --> 00:33:58.999
I said, if you could have<br/>
anything in this whole world

00:33:58.999 --> 00:34:00.999
you want, what would<br/>
you want most?

00:34:00.999 --> 00:34:03.999
And he said, a family,<br/>
my family.

00:34:03.999 --> 00:34:07.999
I'd like to find out who I am<br/>
and where I came from, and who

00:34:07.999 --> 00:34:09.334
I belong to.<br/>

00:34:09.334 --> 00:34:11.999
Father's Day the search ended.<br/>

00:34:11.999 --> 00:34:14.250
Two weeks later, they<br/>
were together.

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:17.999
They captured the moment on<br/>
videotape, and didn't mind

00:34:17.999 --> 00:34:19.375
sharing it.<br/>

00:34:19.375 --> 00:34:21.501
I'm happy because I<br/>
found our family.

00:34:21.501 --> 00:34:23.959
We found our family.<br/>

00:34:23.959 --> 00:34:26.999
And I'm sad and angry because<br/>
we were taken away.

00:34:26.999 --> 00:34:29.999
And I'm sad and anger<br/>
a lot because it

00:34:29.999 --> 00:34:31.999
confused me a lot too.<br/>

00:34:31.999 --> 00:34:34.999
He also helped his sister<br/>
develop a sense of Indian

00:34:34.999 --> 00:34:37.999
pride she'd never had, because<br/>
she was accepted in the

00:34:37.999 --> 00:34:39.792
non-Indian world.<br/>

00:34:39.792 --> 00:34:40.999
They didn't treat me<br/>
any different.

00:34:40.999 --> 00:34:43.999
<br/>

00:34:43.999 --> 00:34:45.792
I guess in a way,<br/>
a lot of times I

00:34:45.792 --> 00:34:46.999
wished that I was white.<br/>

00:34:46.999 --> 00:34:49.999
<br/>

00:34:49.999 --> 00:34:52.999
But I don't anymore.<br/>

00:34:52.999 --> 00:34:55.999
They chose to keep their life in<br/>
the city, although a piece

00:34:55.999 --> 00:34:58.999
of their heart will remain<br/>
on the reservation.

00:34:58.999 --> 00:35:02.667
But they're finding living in<br/>
the city is not always easy

00:35:02.667 --> 00:35:04.584
for young Indian people.<br/>

00:35:04.584 --> 00:35:07.999
If you look toward education,<br/>
you will find part of the

00:35:07.999 --> 00:35:09.709
reason why.<br/>

00:35:09.709 --> 00:35:13.292
On behalf of the Haskell Indian<br/>
Junior College faculty,

00:35:13.292 --> 00:35:17.999
staff, and students, I welcome<br/>
you to our 1989

00:35:17.999 --> 00:35:20.999
commencement exercises.<br/>

00:35:20.999 --> 00:35:23.250
At a moment when education<br/>
is becoming increasingly

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:27.999
important, there is close to<br/>
a 75% dropout rate among

00:35:27.999 --> 00:35:30.999
American Indians who attend<br/>
non-Indian colleges and

00:35:30.999 --> 00:35:31.999
universities.<br/>

00:35:31.999 --> 00:35:35.999
The number is much lower in<br/>
Indian schools, but they are

00:35:35.999 --> 00:35:36.999
few and far between.<br/>

00:35:36.999 --> 00:35:40.999
Concord Career Institute is<br/>
providing the training Darlene

00:35:40.999 --> 00:35:43.999
Lasley needs to make a living.<br/>

00:35:43.999 --> 00:35:46.999
And I've always wanted to be a<br/>
registered nurse, and I think

00:35:46.999 --> 00:35:48.999
I will make it.<br/>

00:35:48.999 --> 00:35:52.999
She says she left the<br/>
reservation to become an RN so

00:35:52.999 --> 00:35:55.999
she can return and give<br/>
reservation Indians the type

00:35:55.999 --> 00:35:59.999
of care non-Indians are<br/>
unable to provide.

00:35:59.999 --> 00:36:02.999
They just don't open up to them<br/>
as much as they would an

00:36:02.999 --> 00:36:05.999
Indian, another Indian.<br/>

00:36:05.999 --> 00:36:08.999
In addition to scholastic<br/>
problems, young Indians, like

00:36:08.999 --> 00:36:11.626
everyone else, are affected<br/>
by drug abuse,

00:36:11.626 --> 00:36:14.999
alcohol, and teen pregnancy.<br/>

00:36:14.999 --> 00:36:18.999
The percentage of our babies<br/>
that are born to girls 19 or

00:36:18.999 --> 00:36:22.918
younger is about one and a half<br/>
times what it is for the

00:36:22.918 --> 00:36:24.999
whole country.<br/>

00:36:24.999 --> 00:36:29.334
The birth rate among the native<br/>
American girls 19 or

00:36:29.334 --> 00:36:32.999
younger is about double what<br/>
that birthrate is for the

00:36:32.999 --> 00:36:33.999
whole country.<br/>

00:36:33.999 --> 00:36:36.999
Some have found their niche by<br/>
sticking to what the elders

00:36:36.999 --> 00:36:39.751
clung to a long time ago.<br/>

00:36:39.751 --> 00:36:50.999
[CHANTING AND SINGING]<br/>

00:36:50.999 --> 00:36:54.999
They sing the songs, beat the<br/>
drum, and keep the heartbeat

00:36:54.999 --> 00:36:57.999
of the American Indian alive.<br/>

00:36:57.999 --> 00:37:01.999
We're sitting down here trying<br/>
to learn our old ways, trying

00:37:01.999 --> 00:37:05.999
to recover some of what the<br/>
white people tried to take

00:37:05.999 --> 00:37:06.999
away from us.<br/>

00:37:06.999 --> 00:37:10.999
Because in the time of the<br/>
1800s, they told us that we

00:37:10.999 --> 00:37:13.999
couldn't sing our songs, that we<br/>
weren't allowed to practice

00:37:13.999 --> 00:37:14.999
our religion.<br/>

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:19.999
And the way that I've been<br/>
taught is that the

00:37:19.999 --> 00:37:24.999
old people are dying.<br/>

00:37:24.999 --> 00:37:29.999
And the young people, my<br/>
generation and the next

00:37:29.999 --> 00:37:33.999
generation after us, if we don't<br/>
learn these ways from

00:37:33.999 --> 00:37:37.999
these old people, they're<br/>
going to die.

00:37:37.999 --> 00:37:41.999
They say their beliefs are<br/>
spiritual, that when God

00:37:41.999 --> 00:37:45.417
created the Earth, it didn't<br/>
have houses, buildings, and

00:37:45.417 --> 00:37:48.999
cars, because the great spirit<br/>
didn't intend for people to

00:37:48.999 --> 00:37:51.042
seek happiness in<br/>
those things.

00:37:51.042 --> 00:37:54.751
The only thing we believe<br/>
we own is this body.

00:37:54.751 --> 00:37:56.999
And if you can't draw the<br/>
happiness from inside your

00:37:56.999 --> 00:38:00.999
heart here, then you don't<br/>
know what happiness is,

00:38:00.999 --> 00:38:05.999
because it can't be measured<br/>
in any material things.

00:38:05.999 --> 00:38:08.999
One of the places you find<br/>
American Indians at their best

00:38:08.999 --> 00:38:09.999
is at pow-wows.<br/>

00:38:09.999 --> 00:38:12.999
They call the events a public<br/>
relations tool.

00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:15.999
They may be, but there's more<br/>
than what meets the eye.

00:38:15.999 --> 00:38:19.999
They burn in the heart and soul<br/>
of many American Indians.

00:38:19.999 --> 00:38:22.999
When we return, you can meet<br/>
some of them as we go out to

00:38:22.999 --> 00:38:24.999
watch them dancing<br/>
in moccasins.

00:38:24.999 --> 00:38:35.999
<br/>

00:38:35.999 --> 00:38:39.999
The dances and songs and<br/>
everything, they're hundreds

00:38:39.999 --> 00:38:42.667
of years old usually, and<br/>
it means a lot to me.

00:38:42.667 --> 00:38:44.999
It makes me feel closer to the<br/>
ancestors before me that I

00:38:44.999 --> 00:38:46.999
never got a chance to meet.<br/>

00:38:46.999 --> 00:38:52.999
<br/>

00:38:52.999 --> 00:38:55.999
I hope that people will walk<br/>
away with the knowledge, or an

00:38:55.999 --> 00:39:01.999
understanding and awareness and<br/>
sensitivity to the way the

00:39:01.999 --> 00:39:06.709
Native American person,<br/>
Indian person thinks.

00:39:06.709 --> 00:39:13.584
[DRUMS AND CHANTING]<br/>

00:39:13.584 --> 00:39:15.999
I'll tell you something<br/>
about Indians.

00:39:15.999 --> 00:39:17.999
When you make friends to an<br/>
Indian, you got you a friend

00:39:17.999 --> 00:39:19.501
for the rest of your life.<br/>

00:39:19.501 --> 00:39:20.999
That's right.<br/>

00:39:20.999 --> 00:39:24.999
This is a typical Northern<br/>
American Indian pow-wow.

00:39:24.999 --> 00:39:27.999
It is the coming together of<br/>
the past and present, and a

00:39:27.999 --> 00:39:28.999
link to the future.<br/>

00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:33.999
You meet the old friends,<br/>
get new friends,

00:39:33.999 --> 00:39:36.999
all fellowship like.<br/>

00:39:36.999 --> 00:39:39.999
I enjoy it more than<br/>
I do going to

00:39:39.999 --> 00:39:42.999
regular churches myself.<br/>

00:39:42.999 --> 00:39:46.834
The pow-wow unites the Indians<br/>
of two worlds, those of the

00:39:46.834 --> 00:39:50.209
city, and those who choose to<br/>
build their life elsewhere.

00:39:50.209 --> 00:39:53.792
Some are reservation Indians.<br/>

00:39:53.792 --> 00:39:57.542
And they've lived that way so<br/>
long, they just can't adjust

00:39:57.542 --> 00:39:59.999
to a civilized world,<br/>
you might say.

00:39:59.999 --> 00:40:02.999
<br/>

00:40:02.999 --> 00:40:05.999
There is an appreciation for the<br/>
problems faced by many of

00:40:05.999 --> 00:40:06.999
the people here.<br/>

00:40:06.999 --> 00:40:09.999
There is a common belief that<br/>
alcoholism and other diseases

00:40:09.999 --> 00:40:13.999
among Indians is due to the lack<br/>
of time to build up the

00:40:13.999 --> 00:40:16.999
immunity other cultures enjoy.<br/>

00:40:16.999 --> 00:40:19.999
Their understanding creates a<br/>
climate of understanding.

00:40:19.999 --> 00:40:24.042
See, all these people are<br/>
my brothers and sisters.

00:40:24.042 --> 00:40:28.959
And I respect them and<br/>
they respect me.

00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:31.999
It is a respect not only for<br/>
each other, but also for

00:40:31.999 --> 00:40:33.999
tradition that brings<br/>
people together.

00:40:33.999 --> 00:40:36.999
Most pow-wows are three day<br/>
events that start at mid

00:40:36.999 --> 00:40:38.999
afternoon with special dances.<br/>

00:40:38.999 --> 00:40:42.999
<br/>

00:40:42.999 --> 00:40:45.999
The table is open for<br/>
all you dancers.

00:40:45.999 --> 00:40:49.999
<br/>

00:40:49.999 --> 00:40:51.999
They are called Gourd<br/>
Dances, and they are

00:40:51.999 --> 00:40:53.999
done to warrior songs.<br/>

00:40:53.999 --> 00:40:57.751
Out of respect to the drums,<br/>
women who are Fancy Dancers

00:40:57.751 --> 00:41:00.999
wear their shawls, while<br/>
traditional women dancers

00:41:00.999 --> 00:41:01.999
carry theirs.<br/>

00:41:01.999 --> 00:41:04.999
And both groups follow the<br/>
men as they move to the

00:41:04.999 --> 00:41:05.999
rhythm of the gourd.<br/>

00:41:05.999 --> 00:41:09.542
<br/>

00:41:09.542 --> 00:41:11.999
There's what's called a<br/>
Special Dance for the

00:41:11.999 --> 00:41:14.999
drummers, the head dancers<br/>
and the head singers.

00:41:14.999 --> 00:41:18.999
And those people in turn honor<br/>
the people who honored them by

00:41:18.999 --> 00:41:20.999
helping to make their<br/>
day special in

00:41:20.999 --> 00:41:22.999
what's called a giveaway.<br/>

00:41:22.999 --> 00:41:24.999
At this time, she has<br/>
some things that she

00:41:24.999 --> 00:41:26.999
would like to giveaway.<br/>

00:41:26.999 --> 00:41:29.999
She has some people who she'd<br/>
like to acknowledge.

00:41:29.999 --> 00:41:35.375
Calling our Northern Head Men<br/>
Dancer, Lawrence Laflor.

00:41:35.375 --> 00:41:38.999
For this lady, the Head Northern<br/>
Dancer, it is an

00:41:38.999 --> 00:41:40.999
intangible gift that<br/>
is most important.

00:41:40.999 --> 00:41:43.999
It's the coming together of<br/>
Indian people, and them

00:41:43.999 --> 00:41:46.999
enjoying themselves and enjoying<br/>
each other, that

00:41:46.999 --> 00:41:49.250
means a lot to me to see that.<br/>

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:51.999
There's also recognition of<br/>
those who were unable to

00:41:51.999 --> 00:41:53.125
attend the pow-wow.<br/>

00:41:53.125 --> 00:41:56.999
A lone tee-pee sits across<br/>
campus, in this case in

00:41:56.999 --> 00:41:59.999
recognition of a student who<br/>
died days before the event.

00:41:59.999 --> 00:42:03.918
And on the pow-wow grounds, a<br/>
dance is done in tribute to

00:42:03.918 --> 00:42:06.999
him as well as some others.<br/>

00:42:06.999 --> 00:42:12.501
We that are living pay homage<br/>
to our fallen brothers.

00:42:12.501 --> 00:42:15.999
And we also know that there's<br/>
a lot of families that have

00:42:15.999 --> 00:42:22.292
lost members in different wars,<br/>
and that we honor them.

00:42:22.292 --> 00:42:23.999
They also feel they<br/>
honor the great

00:42:23.999 --> 00:42:26.042
spirit with their presence.<br/>

00:42:26.042 --> 00:42:30.999
This is a special occasion for<br/>
all the Native Americans.

00:42:30.999 --> 00:42:33.999
There are some who camp out over<br/>
the three day stretch in

00:42:33.999 --> 00:42:35.999
order to take part.<br/>

00:42:35.999 --> 00:42:39.999
Trying to get our supper ready<br/>
so that we can dance.

00:42:39.999 --> 00:42:41.417
And you're left here to cook?<br/>

00:42:41.417 --> 00:42:42.999
Yes.<br/>

00:42:42.999 --> 00:42:47.999
Trying to get my fire going,<br/>
and my fry bread burning.

00:42:47.999 --> 00:42:50.999
Oh no, it's all right.<br/>

00:42:50.999 --> 00:42:52.999
Those who dance no more<br/>
make sure there

00:42:52.999 --> 00:42:54.959
are others to follow.<br/>

00:42:54.959 --> 00:42:58.667
This family drove 23 hours on<br/>
a Friday night so their four

00:42:58.667 --> 00:43:00.999
year old son could dance<br/>
and gain the

00:43:00.999 --> 00:43:01.999
respect of the elders.<br/>

00:43:01.999 --> 00:43:06.999
<br/>

00:43:06.999 --> 00:43:10.999
Following his dance around the<br/>
arena, they drove 23 hours to

00:43:10.999 --> 00:43:13.999
return to New Mexico for<br/>
work on Monday morning.

00:43:13.999 --> 00:43:18.417
All that day is a vacation,<br/>
an initiation of

00:43:18.417 --> 00:43:21.125
dancing, fancy dancing.<br/>

00:43:21.125 --> 00:43:27.999
And I hope in the future, he<br/>
will want to come here and be

00:43:27.999 --> 00:43:30.999
able to remember what<br/>
happened here today.

00:43:30.999 --> 00:43:33.999
Swift Eagle.<br/>

00:43:33.999 --> 00:43:35.999
To the viewing audience, perhaps<br/>
the most spectacular

00:43:35.999 --> 00:43:39.667
part of the pow-wow comes<br/>
up as the sun goes down.

00:43:39.667 --> 00:43:45.999
<br/>

00:43:45.999 --> 00:43:49.999
It is the Grand Entry, led by<br/>
the American flag, the state

00:43:49.999 --> 00:43:53.959
flag, an Indian flag, and<br/>
the Indian staff.

00:43:53.959 --> 00:43:56.918
Everyone is dressed in<br/>
their native regalia.

00:43:56.918 --> 00:43:58.999
You used to be able to tell<br/>
each Indian nation by the

00:43:58.999 --> 00:44:00.999
colors worn.<br/>

00:44:00.999 --> 00:44:03.999
Because of intermarriage and<br/>
loss of tradition, that's not

00:44:03.999 --> 00:44:05.999
the case anymore.<br/>

00:44:05.999 --> 00:44:08.999
But the reflection of the<br/>
rainbow, the imitation of

00:44:08.999 --> 00:44:10.999
nature is still important.<br/>

00:44:10.999 --> 00:44:13.999
Feathers worn are from<br/>
birds of prey.

00:44:13.999 --> 00:44:17.709
The most prestigious is<br/>
the eagle feather.

00:44:17.709 --> 00:44:20.459
Legally it can only be<br/>
owned by Indians.

00:44:20.459 --> 00:44:21.999
Traditionally, it must<br/>
be earned by

00:44:21.999 --> 00:44:25.999
good or heroic deeds.<br/>

00:44:25.999 --> 00:44:27.999
This part of the pow-wow, the<br/>
sector following the Grand

00:44:27.999 --> 00:44:30.999
Entry, is what's known as the<br/>
preliminary phase of the

00:44:30.999 --> 00:44:32.999
contemporary pow-wow.<br/>

00:44:32.999 --> 00:44:35.999
It sets the stage for<br/>
what's to follow.

00:44:35.999 --> 00:44:38.999
The dancers get warmed up and<br/>
ready for their call.

00:44:38.999 --> 00:44:42.999
Charles Tebow, please come to<br/>
the speaker stand, Charles

00:44:42.999 --> 00:44:43.999
Tebow<br/>

00:44:43.999 --> 00:44:46.999
Some say it's even later, when<br/>
the lights come that the real

00:44:46.999 --> 00:44:49.209
dancing begins.<br/>

00:44:49.209 --> 00:44:52.834
It is contest dancing, where<br/>
people circle the drummers,

00:44:52.834 --> 00:44:55.999
moving to warrior songs,<br/>
competing for anything from

00:44:55.999 --> 00:45:04.999
$50 to thousands of dollars.<br/>

00:45:04.999 --> 00:45:07.999
That is how a number of American<br/>
Indians earn their

00:45:07.999 --> 00:45:11.999
living, traveling from pow-wow<br/>
to pow-wow, sharing their

00:45:11.999 --> 00:45:14.999
expertise of traditional<br/>
dances.

00:45:14.999 --> 00:45:18.042
The prize money and contest<br/>
dancing are also one of the

00:45:18.042 --> 00:45:19.999
most controversial aspects.<br/>

00:45:19.999 --> 00:45:22.999
Some traditional Indians<br/>
consider this to be too

00:45:22.999 --> 00:45:26.167
commercial, too much variation<br/>
from tradition.

00:45:26.167 --> 00:45:29.584
But those who choose to take<br/>
part say their efforts are

00:45:29.584 --> 00:45:31.918
sanctioned by the<br/>
Indian people.

00:45:31.918 --> 00:45:34.999
And if that weren't so, the<br/>
pow-wow would not continue to

00:45:34.999 --> 00:45:37.999
exist. And they say there's<br/>
one other thing

00:45:37.999 --> 00:45:39.999
that keeps it going.<br/>

00:45:39.999 --> 00:45:43.626
The most important person is<br/>
observing us and looking at

00:45:43.626 --> 00:45:44.999
us, and that's Almighty God.<br/>

00:45:44.999 --> 00:45:47.626
And if the dancing and singing<br/>
in good spirit,

00:45:47.626 --> 00:45:49.792
he's going to smile.<br/>

00:45:49.792 --> 00:45:52.999
He says that smile kept the<br/>
Indian people alive in the

00:45:52.999 --> 00:45:55.999
past, and it helps<br/>
them presently.

00:45:55.999 --> 00:45:59.667
And as long as it remains, there<br/>
will be Indian people,

00:45:59.667 --> 00:46:03.667
people of tradition, people<br/>
dancing in moccasins.

00:46:03.667 --> 00:47:34.792
[DRUMS AND CHANTING]<br/>

00:47:34.792 --> 00:47:36.999
American Indians who choose<br/>
to move to the

00:47:36.999 --> 00:47:38.584
city do get some help.<br/>

00:47:38.584 --> 00:47:40.999
One third of those who come<br/>
into a seven county area

00:47:40.999 --> 00:47:43.999
surrounding Kansas City go<br/>
through the Heart of America

00:47:43.999 --> 00:47:44.999
Indian Center.<br/>

00:47:44.999 --> 00:47:46.999
But the Center itself<br/>
is in trouble.

00:47:46.999 --> 00:47:49.999
Government budget cuts have<br/>
limited its resources, and

00:47:49.999 --> 00:47:52.999
it's being forced to move<br/>
because the property it's on

00:47:52.999 --> 00:47:54.417
is being sold.<br/>

00:47:54.417 --> 00:47:57.709
The city has offered a new<br/>
location, provided the Heart

00:47:57.709 --> 00:48:00.999
of American Indian Center<br/>
officials can get funding for

00:48:00.999 --> 00:48:01.999
a new building.<br/>

00:48:01.999 --> 00:48:05.459
