00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.300
Why, that is nothing,

186
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.400
for I tell you, father,

187
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.500
I am as peremptory as sheproud-minded,

188
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.370
and where two raging firesmeet together,

189
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.070
they do consume the thingthat feeds their fury.

190
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.730
Though little fire growsgreat with little wind,

191
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.330
yet extreme gusts willblow out fire and all.

192
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.570
So I to her, and so sheyields to me,

193
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:09.530
for I am rough and woo notlike a babe, hmm?

194
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.070
Well mayst thou woo, andhappy be thy speed,

195
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.030
but be thou arm'd for someunhappy words.

196
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.430
Ay, to the proof;

197
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.530
as mountains are forwinds,

198
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.070
that shake not though theyblow perpetually.

199
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.330
Uh, uh, uh!

200
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.700
How now, my friend, whydost thou look so pale?

201
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.100
For fear, I promise you,if I look pale.

202
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.000
What, will my daughterprove a good musician?

203
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.500
Ah, uh!

204
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.900
I think she'll soonerprove a soldier.

205
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.930
Iron may hold with her butnever lutes.

206
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.070
Why, then thou canst notbreak her to the lute?

207
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.400
Why, no, for she hathbroke the lute to me.

208
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.570
I did but tell her shemistook her frets

209
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.700
and bow'd her hand toteach her fingering

210
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.570
when, with a mostimpatient devilish spirit,

211
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.770
"Frets, call you these?"quoth she,

212
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.270
"I'll fume with them."

213
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.200
And with that word, shestruck me on the head,

214
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.700
and through the instrument,my pate made way;

215
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.970
and there I stood amazedfor a while,

216
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.200
as on a pillory, lookingthrough the lute,

217
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.300
while she did call merascal fiddler

218
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.870
and twangling Jack

219
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.900
and 20 such vile terms

220
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.500
as had she studied tomisuse me so.

221
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.600
Ooh.

222
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.730
Now, by the world, it is alusty wench.

223
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.130
I love her ten times morethan ever I did.

224
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.730
O, how I long to have somechat with her.

225
00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:33.170
Well, go with me, and benot so discomfited.

226
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.030
Proceed in practise withmy younger daughter.

227
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.630
She's apt to learn andthankful for good turns.

228
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.800
Signior Petruchio, willyou go with us?

229
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.800
Or shall I send mydaughter Kate to you?

230
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.800
I pray you do.

231
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:50.430
Come.

232
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.900
I'll attend her here...

233
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:59.300
and woo her with somespirit when she comes.

234
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.200
Say that she rail.

235
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.630
Why, then, I'll tell herplain

236
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:12.130
she sings as sweetly as anightingale.

237
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.800
Say that she frown.

238
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.770
I'll say she looks asclear

239
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:22.570
as morning roses newlywash'd with dew.

240
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.870
Say she be mute and willnot speak a word.

241
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.230
Then I'll commend hervolubility

242
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.930
and say she utterethpiercing eloquence.

243
00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.970
If she do bid me pack,

244
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.470
I'll give her thanks asthough she bid me stay byher a week.

245
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.130
If she deny to wed,

246
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.170
I'll crave the day when Ishall ask the banns

247
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.900
and when be married.

248
00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:01.230
But here she comes, andnow, Petruchio, speak.

249
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.970
Good morrow, Kate...

250
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.400
for that's your name, Ihear.

251
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.730
Well have you heard, butsomething hard of hearing.

252
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.070
They call me Katharinethat do talk of me.

253
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.630
You lie, in faith, for youare call'd plain Kate

254
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:29.730
and bonny Kate andsometimes Kate the cursed,

255
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.470
but Kate, the prettiestKate in Christendom,

256
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.370
Kate of Kate Hall,

257
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.230
my super dainty Kate,

258
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.930
for dainties are allKates--

259
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.670
Ha, ha, ha!

260
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.200
And therefore, Kate,

261
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.100
take this of me, Kate ofmy consolation,

262
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.500
hearing thy mildnesspraised in every town,

263
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.470
thy virtues spoke of, andthy beauty sounded--

264
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.770
yet not so deeply as tothee belongs--

265
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.730
myself am moved to woothee for my wife.

266
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.170
"Moved"--in good time.

267
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:05.230
Let him that moved youhither remove you hence.

268
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.830
I knew you at the firstyou were a moveable.

269
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.870
Why, what's a moveable?

270
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.270
A join'd stool.

271
00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.570
Thou hast hit it.

272
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.030
Come, sit on me.

273
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.600
Asses are made to bear,

274
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.870
and so are you.

275
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.830
Women are made to bear,

276
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.300
and so are you.

277
00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.270
No such jade as you, if meyou mean.

278
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.030
Alas, good Kate, I willnot burden thee,

279
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:36.070
for, knowing thee to bebut young and light--

280
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.370
Too light for such a swainas you to catch

281
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.430
and yet as heavy as myweight should be.

282
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.930
Should be-- should--buzz--

283
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.000
Well ta'en,

284
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.870
and like a buzzard.

285
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:52.170
O slow-wing'd turtle,shall a buzzard take thee?

286
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.500
Ay, for a turtle, as hetakes a buzzard.

287
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.930
Come, come, you wasp, i'faith, you are too angry.

288
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:05.370
If I be waspish, bestbeware my sting.

289
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.270
My remedy is then to pluckit out.

290
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:11.200
Ay, if the fool could findit where it lies.

291
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.330
Who knows not where a waspdoes wear his sting?

292
00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.130
In his tail.

293
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.330
In his tongue.

294
00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.770
Whose tongue?

295
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.700
Yours, if you talk oftails,

296
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.930
and so farewell.

297
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.730
What, with my tongue inyour tail?

298
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.300
Nay, come again, goodKate.

299
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.730
I am a gentleman.

300
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.070
That I'll try.

301
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.600
Mm-hmm.

302
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.870
I swear I'll cuff you ifyou strike again.

303
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.570
So may you lose your arms.

304
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:54.100
If you strike me, you areno gentleman,

305
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.370
and if no gentleman, why,then, no arms.

306
00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.700
A herald, Kate?

307
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.930
Ooh, put me in thy books.

308
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.170
What is your crest?

309
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.470
A coxcomb?

310
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:09.270
A combless cock, so Katewill be my hen.

311
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.900
No cock of mine.

312
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:19.400
You crow too like acraven.

313
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.830
Er-bock, bock, bock, bock.

314
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.700
Nay, come, Kate, come.

315
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.000
You must not look so sour.

316
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.130
It is my fashion when Isee a crab.

317
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.430
Why, here's no crab, andtherefore look not sour.

318
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:35.630
Oh, ho, ho, there is.

319
00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.400
Oh, ho, ho, there is.

320
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.570
Bock, bock, bock, bock.

321
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.070
Then show it me.

322
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.070
Had I a glass, I would.

323
00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.400
What, you mean my face?

324
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.000
Well aim'd of such a youngone.

325
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.930
Now, by Saint George, I amtoo young for you.

326
00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.530
Yet you are wither'd.

327
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.770
'Tis with cares.

328
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.130
I care not.

329
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.600
Nay, hear you, Kate.

330
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.330
In sooth you scape not so.

331
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.930
I chafe you if I tarry.

332
00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.670
Let me go!

333
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:10.800
No, not a whit.

334
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.430
I find you passing gentle.

335
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:16.300
'Twas told me you wererough and coy and sullen,

336
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.170
and now I find report avery liar,

337
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:21.970
for thou are pleasant,gamesome, passing courteous,

338
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.130
but slow in speech

339
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.800
yet sweet as springtimeflowers.

340
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.570
Ah, thou canst not frown.

341
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.630
Thou canst not lookaskance

342
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.470
nor bite the lip as angrywenches will,

343
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.500
nor hast thou pleasure tobe cross in talk,

344
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:40.300
but thou with mildnessentertain'st thy wooers,

345
00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.730
with gentle conference,soft and affable.

346
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:52.170
Why does the world reportthat Kate doth limp?

347
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.900
O slanderous world.

348
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.370
Kate, like the hazel-twig,

349
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.930
is straight and slenderand as brown in hue

350
00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.270
as hazelnuts and sweeterthan the kernels.

351
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.400
Let me see thee walk.

352
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.970
Thou dost not halt.

353
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:07.630
Go, fool, and whom thoukeep'st command.

354
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.900
Did e'er Dian so become agrove as Kate

355
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.770
this chamber with herprincely gait?

356
00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.630
O, be thou Dian, and lether be Kate,

357
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.670
and then let Kate bechaste and Dian sportful.

358
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.230
Where did you study allthis goodly speech?

359
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.670
It is extempore, from mymother wit.

360
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.830
A witty mother...

361
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.230
witless else her son.

362
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.400
Am I not wise?

363
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.000
Yes; keep you warm.

Ahem.

How but well, sir? How butwell?

385
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.700
It were impossible Ishould speed amiss.

386
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.570
Why, how now, daughterKatharine?

387
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:40.830
In your dumps?

388
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.030
Call you me daughter?

389
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:46.170
Now, I promise you, you showa tender fatherly regard

390
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.800
to wish me wed to one halflunatic,

391
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.170
a madcap ruffian, and aswearing Jack

392
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.570
that thinks with oaths toface the matter out.

393
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:55.900
Bock, bock.

394
00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.870
Father, 'tis thus,

395
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.930
yourself and all the worldthat talk'd of her

396
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.230
have talk'd amiss of her.

397
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.370
Bock, bock.

398
00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:05.930
If she be cursed, it isfor policy,

399
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:10.730
for she's not froward butmodest as the dove.

400
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.870
She is not hot buttemperate as the morn.

401
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.300
For patience, she willprove a second Grissel

402
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.830
and Roman Lucrece for herchastity;

403
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.070
and to conclude, we haveagreed so well together

404
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.430
that upon Sunday is thewedding day.

405
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.930
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,ho.

Ha, ha, ha, ha.

408

410
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.530
Is this your speeding?

I choose her for myself.

414
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.400
If she and I be pleased,what's that to you?

415
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.530
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt ustwain, being alone,

416
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.500
that she shall still becursed in company.

417
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.600
Oh, I tell you, 'tisincredible to believe

418
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.700
how much she loves me.

419
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.930
O, the kindest Kate,

420
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.570

Give me thy hand, Kate.

Faith, gentlemen, now Iplay a merchant's part

453

and venture madly on adesperate mart.

454
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.370
'Twas a commodity layfretting by you.

'Twill bring you gain orperish on the seas.

456

The gain I seek is quietin the match.

457
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.800
No doubt but he hath got aquiet catch.

458

But now, Baptista, to youryounger daughter.

Youngling, thou canst notlove so dear as I.

464
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.370
Graybeard, thy love dothfreeze.

465
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:32.570
But thine doth fry.

466
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.670
Skipper, stand back.

467
00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:34.930
'Tis age that nourisheth.

Oh, say, Signior Gremio,what can you assure her?

477
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.900
Oh.

478
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.570
First, as you know,

479
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:08.870
my house within the city

480
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:12.170
is richly furnished withplate and gold,

481
00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:15.300
basins and ewers to laveher dainty hands,

482
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:19.100
my hangings all of Tyriantapestry.

483
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.000
In ivory coffers, I havestuff'd my crowns,

484
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.170
in cypress chests, myarras counterpoints,

485
00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.570
costly apparel, tents, andcanopies,

486
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.970
fine linen,

487
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.330
Turkey cushions boss'dwith pearl,

488
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:35.400
valance of Venice gold inneedlework,

489
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.200
pewter and brass and allthings

490
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.030
that belong to house orhousekeeping.

491
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:43.200
Ahem.

492
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.330
Then, at my farm,

493
00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.370
I have a hundredmilch-kine to the pail,

494
00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.300
sixscore fat oxen standingin my stalls,

495
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.230
and all things answerableto this portion.

496
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.600
Myself am struck in years,I must confess,

497
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.730
and if I die tomorrow,this is hers

498
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.830
if, whilst I live, shewill be only mine.

499
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.470
That "only" came well in.

500
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:09.000
Sir, list to me.

501
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.130
I am my father's heir andonly son.

502
00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.900
If I may have yourdaughter to my wife,

503
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.070
I'll leave her housesthree or four as good

504
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:17.270
within rich Pisa's walls

505
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:20.330
as any one Old SigniorGremio has in Padua

506
00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:24.400
beside 2,000 ducats by theyear of fruitful land,

507
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.670
all which shall be herjointure.

508
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.730
What, have I pinch'd you,Signior Gremio?

509
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.570
2,000 ducats by the yearof land.

510
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.000
My land amounts not to somuch in all.

511
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.200
That she shall havebesides an argosy

512
00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.170
that now is lying inMarseilles' road.

513
00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.900
What, have I choked youwith an argosy?

514
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.200
Gremio, 'tis known myfather

515
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.030
hath no less than 3 greatargosies

516
00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:54.000
beside 2 galliasses and 12tight galleys.

517
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.200
These I will assure her

518
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.800
and twice as much whate'erthou offer'st next.

519
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.900
Nay, I have offer'd all.

520
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.430
I have no more,

521
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.030
and she can have no morethan all I have.

522
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:09.830
If you like me, she shallhave me and mine.

523
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.830
Why, then the maid is minefrom all the world

524
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:13.970
by your firm promise.

525
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:15.130
Gremio is out-vied.

526
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.870
I must confess, your offeris the best,

527
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.430
and let your father makeher the assurance,

528
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:21.600
she is your own,

529
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.770
else, you must pardon me,

530
00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:28.230
if you should die beforehim, where's her dower?

531
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.470
That's but a cavil.

532
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.470
He is old; I, young.

533
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.800
And may not young men dieas well as old?

534
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.500
Well, gentlemen,

535
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.900
I am thus resolved.

536
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.330
On Sunday next, you knowmy daughter Katharine

537
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:43.500

538
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.600
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

539
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.170
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

540
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.530
Now, on the Sundayfollowing shall Bianca bebride to you

541
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.270
if you make thisassurance.

542
00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:56.830
If not, to Signior Gremio.

543
00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:01.870
And so, I take my leave...

544
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.130
and thank you both.

545
00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:05.070
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,ha, ha, ha.

546
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.430
Adieu, good neighbor.

547
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:16.000
Now I fear thee not.

548
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.830
Sirrah young gamester,

549
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:21.070
your father were a fool togive thee all

550
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:24.470
and in his waning age setfoot under thy table.

551
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.770
Tut, a toy!

552
00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:30.300
An old Italian fox is notso kind, my boy.

553
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.230
A vengeance on your craftywither'd hide!

554
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.700
Yet I have faced it with acard of ten.

555
00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:43.300
'Tis in my head to do mymaster good.

556
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.570
Oh, I see no reason butsupposed Lucentio

557
00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:49.530
must get a father call'd"supposed Vincentio,"

558
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:50.800
and that's a wonder.

559
00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.500
Fathers commonly do gettheir children,

560
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.670
but in this case ofwooing,

561
00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:59.500
a child shall get a sire ifI fail not of my cunning.

562
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.200
