00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.070


2
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.200
Uh!

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.300
Cah!

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.300
Ah!

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.300
Mm.

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.300
Ha!

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.100
Mm.

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.100
Ah.

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.170
Uh.

10
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.170
Uh.

11
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.330
Uh.

12
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.970
Uh.

13
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.100
Good sister,

14
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.070
wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,

15
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.830
to make a bondmaid and a slave of me.

16
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.570
That, I disdain--

17
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.130
Ah!

18
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.170
But for these other gawds,

19
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.930
unbind my hands.

20
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.430
I'll pull them off myself,

21
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.170
yea, all my raiment to my petticoat,

22
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.270
or what you will command me will I do

23
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.400
so well do I know my duty to my elders.

24
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.430
Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee,

25
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.830
tell whom thou lovest best.

26
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.130
See thou dissemble not!

27
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.000
Believe me, sister, of all the men alive,

28
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.070
I never yet beheld that special face

29
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.370
which I could fancy more than any other.

30
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.070
Minion, thou liest!

31
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.330
Is't not Hortensio?

32
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.430
Oh, if you affect him, sister, here I swear,

33
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.400
I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have him.

34
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.570
O then, belike, you fancy riches more.

35
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.130
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.

36
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.400
Ah! Aha!

37
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.200
Is it for him you do envy me so?

38
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.930
Nay, then you jest,

39
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.300
and now, I well perceive

40
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.330
you have but jested with me all this while.

41
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.330
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands!

42
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.570
If that be jest, then all the rest was so!

43
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.670
You!

44
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.770
You!

45
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.770
Why, how now, dame!

46
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.600
Bianca!

47
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.670
Whence grows this insolence?

48
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.000
Stand aside.

49
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.530
Poor girl, she weeps.

50
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.730
Go ply thy needle.

51
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.900
Meddle not with her.

52
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.570
For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit.

53
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.870
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?

54
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.070
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?

55
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.430
Her silence flouts me!

56
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.630
And I'll be revenged!

57
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.800
What, in my sight?

58
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.130
Bianca, get thee in.

59
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.230
Oh!

60
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.500
What, will you not suffer me?

61
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.000
Nay, now I see she is your treasure.

62
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.530
She must have a husband.

63
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.130
I must dance barefoot on her wedding day

64
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.230
and for your love to her lead apes in hell!

65
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.730
Oh, talk not to me!

66
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.930
I will go sit and weep

67
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.600
till I can find occasion of revenge.

68
00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.700
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

69
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.900
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

70
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.900
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

71
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.370
Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?

72
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.900
Ahem.

73
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.200
But who comes here?

74
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.330
Good morrow, neighbor Baptista.

75
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.530
Good morrow, Signior Gremio.

76
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.600
God save you, gentlemen.

77
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.870
And you, good sir.

78
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.870
Pray, have you not a daughter call'd Katharina,

79
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.470
fair and virtuous?

80
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.700
Ah!

81
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.370
I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.

82
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.530
You are too blunt.

83
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.170
Go to it orderly.

84
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.770
You wrong me, Signior Gremio.

85
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:52.930
Give me leave.

86
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.230
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,

87
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.670
that, hearing of her beauty and her wit,

88
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.200
her affability and bashful modesty, her--

89
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.830
Oh, ho!

90
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.500
wondrous qualities and mild behavior,

91
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.270
am bold to show myself

92
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.530
a forward guest within your house,

93
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.900
to make mine eye the witness

94
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.030
of that report which I so oft have heard.

95
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.800
Ah, ha!

96
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.030
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,

97
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.900
I do present you with a man of mine,

98
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.870
cunning in music and the mathematics,

99
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.970
to instruct her fully in those sciences,

100
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.130
whereof I know she is not ignorant.

101
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.900
Accept of him, or else you do me wrong.

102
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.500
His name is Licio, born in Mantua.

103
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.730
You're welcome, sir, and he, for your good sake,

104
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.670
but for my daughter Katharine, this I know,

105
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.800
she is not for your turn, the more my grief.

106
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.770
I see you do not mean to part with her,

107
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.370
or else you like not of my company.

108
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.500
Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.

109
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.770
Whence are you, sir?

110
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:46.970
What may I call your name?

111
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.500
Petruchio is my name, Antonio's son,

112
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.400
a man well-known throughout all Italy.

113
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.670
I know him well.

114
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.270
Oh, no.

115
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.100
You are welcome for his sake.

116
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.630
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,

117
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.270
let us that are poor petitioners speak too:

118
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.530
Baccare, you are marvellous forward.

119
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.200
O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.

120
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.470
I doubt it not, sir,

121
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.170
but you will curse your wooing.

122
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.230
Neighbor, this is a gift very grateful,

123
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.570
I am sure of it.

124
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.500
To express the like kindness, myself that have been

125
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.770
more kindly beholding to you than any,

126
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.230
freely give unto you this young scholar,

127
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.230
that hath been long studying at Rheims,

128
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.400
as cunning in Greek and Latin and other languages

129
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.230
as the other in music and mathematics.

130
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.370
His name is--

131
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.500
Cambio.

132
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.630
Cambio.

133
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.970
Pray, accept his service.

134
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.500
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.

135
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.700
You are welcome, good Cambio.

136
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.500
But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger.

137
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.030
May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?

138
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.730
Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,

139
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.870
that, being a stranger in this city here,

140
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.830
do make myself a suitor to your daughter,

141
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.530
unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.

142
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.230
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me

143
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.730
in the preferment of the elder sister.

144
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.870
This liberty is all that I request:

145
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.200
that, upon knowledge of my parentage,

146
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.100
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo

147
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.200
and free access and favour as the rest,

148
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.770
and toward the education of your daughters,

149
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.900
I here bestow a simple instrument,

150
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.570
and this small packet of Greek and Latin books.

151
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.030
If you accept them, then their worth is great.

152
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.600
Lucentio is your name.

153
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.270
Of whence, I pray?

154
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.800
Of Pisa, sir, son to Vincentio.

155
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.330
A mighty man of Pisa.

156
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.930
By report, I know him well.

157
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.730
You are very welcome, sir,

158
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.730
take you the lute and you the set of books.

159
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.600
You shall go see your pupils presently.

160
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.700
Holla, within.

161
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.900
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen to my daughters,

162
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.930
and tell them both these are their tutors.

163
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.900
Bid them use them well.

164
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.370
We will go walk a little in the orchard, and then to dinner.

165
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.600
You are passing welcome,

166
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.470
and so I pray you all to think yourselves.

167
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.470
Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,

168
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.030
and every day, I cannot come to woo.

169
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.070
You knew my father well, and in him me,

170
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.400
left solely heir to all his lands and goods,

171
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.900
which I have better'd rather than decreased.

172
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.530
Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,

173
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.070
what dowry shall I have with her to wife?

174
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.870
After my death, the one half of my lands

175
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.230
and in possession 20,000 crowns.

176
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.600
And for that dowry,

177
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.200
I'll assure her of her widowhood,

178
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.470
be it that she survive me,

179
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.670
in all my lands and leases whatsoever.

180
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.900
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us

181
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.870
that covenants may be kept on either hand.

182
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.500
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd--

183
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.800
that is, her love,

184
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.130
for that is all in all.

185
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.300
Why, that is nothing,

186
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.400
for I tell you, father,

187
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.500
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded,

188
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.370
and where two raging fires meet together,

189
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.070
they do consume the thing that feeds their fury.

190
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.730
Though little fire grows great with little wind,

191
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.330
yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all.

192
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.570
So I to her, and so she yields to me,

193
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:09.530
for I am rough and woo not like a babe, hmm?

194
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.070
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed,

195
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.030
but be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.

196
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.430
Ay, to the proof;

197
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.530
as mountains are for winds,

198
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.070
that shake not though they blow perpetually.

199
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.330
Uh, uh, uh!

200
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.700
How now, my friend, why dost thou look so pale?

201
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.100
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.

202
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.000
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?

203
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.500
Ah, uh!

204
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.900
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier.

205
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.930
Iron may hold with her but never lutes.

206
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.070
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?

207
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.400
Why, no, for she hath broke the lute to me.

208
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.570
I did but tell her she mistook her frets

209
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.700
and bow'd her hand to teach her fingering

210
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.570
when, with a most impatient devilish spirit,

211
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.770
"Frets, call you these?" quoth she,

212
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.270
"I'll fume with them."

213
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.200
And with that word, she struck me on the head,

214
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.700
and through the instrument, my pate made way;

215
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.970
and there I stood amazed for a while,

216
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.200
as on a pillory, looking through the lute,

217
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.300
while she did call me rascal fiddler

218
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.870
and twangling Jack

219
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.900
and 20 such vile terms

220
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.500
as had she studied to misuse me so.

221
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.600
Ooh.

222
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.730
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench.

223
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.130
I love her ten times more than ever I did.

224
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.730
O, how I long to have some chat with her.

225
00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:33.170
Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited.

226
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.030
Proceed in practise with my younger daughter.

227
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.630
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.

228
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.800
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us?

229
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.800
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?

230
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.800
I pray you do.

231
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:50.430
Come.

232
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.900
I'll attend her here...

233
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:59.300
and woo her with some spirit when she comes.

234
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.200
Say that she rail.

235
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.630
Why, then, I'll tell her plain

236
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:12.130
she sings as sweetly as a nightingale.

237
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.800
Say that she frown.

238
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.770
I'll say she looks as clear

239
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:22.570
as morning roses newly wash'd with dew.

240
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.870
Say she be mute and will not speak a word.

241
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.230
Then I'll commend her volubility

242
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.930
and say she uttereth piercing eloquence.

243
00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.970
If she do bid me pack,

244
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.470
I'll give her thanks as though she bid me stay by her a week.

245
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.130
If she deny to wed,

246
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.170
I'll crave the day when I shall ask the banns

247
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.900
and when be married.

248
00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:01.230
But here she comes, and now, Petruchio, speak.

249
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.970
Good morrow, Kate...

250
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.400
for that's your name, I hear.

251
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.730
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing.

252
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.070
They call me Katharine that do talk of me.

253
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.630
You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate

254
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:29.730
and bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the cursed,

255
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.470
but Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,

256
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.370
Kate of Kate Hall,

257
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.230
my super dainty Kate,

258
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.930
for dainties are all Kates--

259
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.670
Ha, ha, ha!

260
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.200
And therefore, Kate,

261
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.100
take this of me, Kate of my consolation,

262
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.500
hearing thy mildness praised in every town,

263
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.470
thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded--

264
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.770
yet not so deeply as to thee belongs--

265
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.730
myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.

266
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.170
"Moved"--in good time.

267
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:05.230
Let him that moved you hither remove you hence.

268
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.830
I knew you at the first you were a moveable.

269
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.870
Why, what's a moveable?

270
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.270
A join'd stool.

271
00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.570
Thou hast hit it.

272
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.030
Come, sit on me.

273
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.600
Asses are made to bear,

274
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.870
and so are you.

275
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.830
Women are made to bear,

276
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.300
and so are you.

277
00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.270
No such jade as you, if me you mean.

278
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.030
Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee,

279
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:36.070
for, knowing thee to be but young and light--

280
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.370
Too light for such a swain as you to catch

281
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.430
and yet as heavy as my weight should be.

282
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.930
Should be-- should--buzz--

283
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.000
Well ta'en,

284
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.870
and like a buzzard.

285
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:52.170
O slow-wing'd turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?

286
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.500
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.

287
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.930
Come, come, you wasp, i' faith, you are too angry.

288
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:05.370
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.

289
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.270
My remedy is then to pluck it out.

290
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:11.200
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.

291
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.330
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?

292
00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.130
In his tail.

293
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.330
In his tongue.

294
00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.770
Whose tongue?

295
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.700
Yours, if you talk of tails,

296
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.930
and so farewell.

297
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.730
What, with my tongue in your tail?

298
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.300
Nay, come again, good Kate.

299
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.730
I am a gentleman.

300
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.070
That I'll try.

301
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.600
Mm-hmm.

302
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.870
I swear I'll cuff you if you strike again.

303
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.570
So may you lose your arms.

304
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:54.100
If you strike me, you are no gentleman,

305
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.370
and if no gentleman, why, then, no arms.

306
00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.700
A herald, Kate?

307
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.930
Ooh, put me in thy books.

308
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.170
What is your crest?

309
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.470
A coxcomb?

310
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:09.270
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.

311
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.900
No cock of mine.

312
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:19.400
You crow too like a craven.

313
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.830
Er-bock, bock, bock, bock.

314
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.700
Nay, come, Kate, come.

315
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.000
You must not look so sour.

316
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.130
It is my fashion when I see a crab.

317
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.430
Why, here's no crab, and therefore look not sour.

318
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:35.630
Oh, ho, ho, there is.

319
00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.400
Oh, ho, ho, there is.

320
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.570
Bock, bock, bock, bock.

321
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.070
Then show it me.

322
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.070
Had I a glass, I would.

323
00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.400
What, you mean my face?

324
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.000
Well aim'd of such a young one.

325
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.930
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.

326
00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.530
Yet you are wither'd.

327
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.770
'Tis with cares.

328
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.130
I care not.

329
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.600
Nay, hear you, Kate.

330
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.330
In sooth you scape not so.

331
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.930
I chafe you if I tarry.

332
00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.670
Let me go!

333
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:10.800
No, not a whit.

334
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.430
I find you passing gentle.

335
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:16.300
'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,

336
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.170
and now I find report a very liar,

337
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:21.970
for thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,

338
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.130
but slow in speech

339
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.800
yet sweet as springtime flowers.

340
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.570
Ah, thou canst not frown.

341
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.630
Thou canst not look askance

342
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.470
nor bite the lip as angry wenches will,

343
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.500
nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,

344
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:40.300
but thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,

345
00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.730
with gentle conference, soft and affable.

346
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:52.170
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?

347
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.900
O slanderous world.

348
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.370
Kate, like the hazel-twig,

349
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.930
is straight and slender and as brown in hue

350
00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.270
as hazelnuts and sweeter than the kernels.

351
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.400
Let me see thee walk.

352
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.970
Thou dost not halt.

353
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:07.630
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.

354
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.900
Did e'er Dian so become a grove as Kate

355
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.770
this chamber with her princely gait?

356
00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.630
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate,

357
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.670
and then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful.

358
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.230
Where did you study all this goodly speech?

359
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.670
It is extempore, from my mother wit.

360
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.830
A witty mother...

361
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.230
witless else her son.

362
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.400
Am I not wise?

363
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.000
Yes; keep you warm.

364
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:51.170
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharine, in thy bed,

365
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.430
and therefore,

366
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:55.930
setting all this chat aside,

367
00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.070
thus in plain terms.

368
00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.870
Your father hath consented that you shall be my wife,

369
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.070
your dowry 'greed on,

370
00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:03.500
and will you, nill you,

371
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.170
I will marry you.

372
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.000
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn,

373
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.800
for, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty--

374
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:17.470
thy beauty that doth make me like thee well--

375
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.300
thou must be married to no man but me,

376
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.430
for I am he am born to tame you, Kate,

377
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.130
and bring you from a wild Kate

378
00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.470
to a Kate conformable as other household Kates.

379
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:26.630
Ahem.

380
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:27.770
Here comes your father.

381
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:28.870
Never make denial,

382
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.300
I must and will have Katharine to my wife.

383
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.270
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?

384
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.770
How but well, sir? How but well?

385
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.700
It were impossible I should speed amiss.

386
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.570
Why, how now, daughter Katharine?

387
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:40.830
In your dumps?

388
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.030
Call you me daughter?

389
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:46.170
Now, I promise you, you show a tender fatherly regard

390
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.800
to wish me wed to one half lunatic,

391
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.170
a madcap ruffian, and a swearing Jack

392
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.570
that thinks with oaths to face the matter out.

393
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:55.900
Bock, bock.

394
00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.870
Father, 'tis thus,

395
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.930
yourself and all the world that talk'd of her

396
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.230
have talk'd amiss of her.

397
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.370
Bock, bock.

398
00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:05.930
If she be cursed, it is for policy,

399
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:10.730
for she's not froward but modest as the dove.

400
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.870
She is not hot but temperate as the morn.

401
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.300
For patience, she will prove a second Grissel

402
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.830
and Roman Lucrece for her chastity;

403
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.070
and to conclude, we have agreed so well together

404
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.430
that upon Sunday is the wedding day.

405
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.930
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

406
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.730
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.

407
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:27.930
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

408
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.330
Hark, Petruchio,

409
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.170
she says she'll see thee hang'd first.

410
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.530
Is this your speeding?

411
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.170
Nay, then, good night our part.

412
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.670
Ah, ha, ha, be patient, gentlemen.

413
00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:38.230
I choose her for myself.

414
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.400
If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?

415
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.530
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,

416
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.500
that she shall still be cursed in company.

417
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.600
Oh, I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe

418
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.700
how much she loves me.

419
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.930
O, the kindest Kate,

420
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.570
she hung about my neck,

421
00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.500
and, kiss on kiss, she vied so fast,

422
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.730
protesting oath on oath,

423
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.300
that in a twink she won me to her love.

424
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.370
O, you are novices.

425
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:09.070
'Tis a world to see how tame,

426
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.530
when men and women are alone,

427
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.400
a meacock wretch can make the cursedest shrew.

428
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.570
Give me thy hand, Kate.

429
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.230
I will unto Venice to buy apparel

430
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.470
'gainst the wedding day.

431
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.670
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests.

432
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:23.630
I will be sure my Katharine will be fine.

433
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.300
I know not what to say,

434
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.900
but give me your hands.

435
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.330
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

436
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:34.400
God send you joy, Petruchio!

437
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.600
Ah, ha, ha!

438
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.730
'Tis a match.

439
00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:37.870
Amen, say we.

440
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:38.970
We will be witnesses.

441
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.070
Witnesses.

442
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.570
Father and wife and gentlemen,

443
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:42.670
adieu.

444
00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:43.770
I will to Venice.

445
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.030
Sunday comes apace.

446
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.100
We will have rings and things and fine array,

447
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.300
and kiss me, Kate.

448
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.530
Ha!

449
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:53.970
We will be married on Sunday.

450
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.670
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

451
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.570
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?

452
00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:03.100
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part

453
00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.000
and venture madly on a desperate mart.

454
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.370
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you.

455
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.400
'Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas.

456
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.130
The gain I seek is quiet in the match.

457
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.800
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.

458
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.330
But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter.

459
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.900
Now is the day we long have looked for.

460
00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.800
I am your neighbor and was suitor first.

461
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.430
And I am one that love Bianca

462
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.070
more than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.

463
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.370
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.

464
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.370
Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.

465
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:32.570
But thine doth fry.

466
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.670
Skipper, stand back.

467
00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:34.930
'Tis age that nourisheth.

468
00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:37.200
Ah, but youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.

469
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.400
Content you, gentlemen.

470
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.770
I will compound this strife.

471
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.530
'Tis deeds must win the prize,

472
00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.970
and he of both that can assure my daughter greatest dower

473
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.800
shall have my Bianca's love.

474
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:55.430
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

475
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

476
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.270
Oh, say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?

477
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.900
Oh.

478
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.570
First, as you know,

479
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:08.870
my house within the city

480
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:12.170
is richly furnished with plate and gold,

481
00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:15.300
basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands,

482
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:19.100
my hangings all of Tyrian tapestry.

483
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.000
In ivory coffers, I have stuff'd my crowns,

484
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.170
in cypress chests, my arras counterpoints,

485
00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.570
costly apparel, tents, and canopies,

486
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.970
fine linen,

487
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.330
Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,

488
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:35.400
valance of Venice gold in needlework,

489
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.200
pewter and brass and all things

490
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.030
that belong to house or housekeeping.

491
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:43.200
Ahem.

492
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.330
Then, at my farm,

493
00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.370
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,

494
00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.300
sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,

495
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.230
and all things answerable to this portion.

496
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.600
Myself am struck in years, I must confess,

497
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.730
and if I die tomorrow, this is hers

498
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.830
if, whilst I live, she will be only mine.

499
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.470
That "only" came well in.

500
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:09.000
Sir, list to me.

501
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.130
I am my father's heir and only son.

502
00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.900
If I may have your daughter to my wife,

503
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.070
I'll leave her houses three or four as good

504
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:17.270
within rich Pisa's walls

505
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:20.330
as any one Old Signior Gremio has in Padua

506
00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:24.400
beside 2,000 ducats by the year of fruitful land,

507
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.670
all which shall be her jointure.

508
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.730
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?

509
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.570
2,000 ducats by the year of land.

510
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.000
My land amounts not to so much in all.

511
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.200
That she shall have besides an argosy

512
00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.170
that now is lying in Marseilles' road.

513
00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.900
What, have I choked you with an argosy?

514
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.200
Gremio, 'tis known my father

515
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.030
hath no less than 3 great argosies

516
00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:54.000
beside 2 galliasses and 12 tight galleys.

517
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.200
These I will assure her

518
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.800
and twice as much whate'er thou offer'st next.

519
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.900
Nay, I have offer'd all.

520
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.430
I have no more,

521
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.030
and she can have no more than all I have.

522
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:09.830
If you like me, she shall have me and mine.

523
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.830
Why, then the maid is mine from all the world

524
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:13.970
by your firm promise.

525
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:15.130
Gremio is out-vied.

526
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.870
I must confess, your offer is the best,

527
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.430
and let your father make her the assurance,

528
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:21.600
she is your own,

529
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.770
else, you must pardon me,

530
00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:28.230
if you should die before him, where's her dower?

531
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.470
That's but a cavil.

532
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.470
He is old; I, young.

533
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.800
And may not young men die as well as old?

534
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.500
Well, gentlemen,

535
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.900
I am thus resolved.

536
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.330
On Sunday next, you know my daughter Katharine

537
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:43.500
is to be married.

538
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.600
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

539
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.170
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

540
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.530
Now, on the Sunday following shall Bianca be bride to you

541
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.270
if you make this assurance.

542
00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:56.830
If not, to Signior Gremio.

543
00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:01.870
And so, I take my leave...

544
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.130
and thank you both.

545
00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:05.070
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

546
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.430
Adieu, good neighbor.

547
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:16.000
Now I fear thee not.

548
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.830
Sirrah young gamester,

549
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:21.070
your father were a fool to give thee all

550
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:24.470
and in his waning age set foot under thy table.

551
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.770
Tut, a toy!

552
00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:30.300
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.

553
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.230
A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!

554
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.700
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.

555
00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:43.300
'Tis in my head to do my master good.

556
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.570
Oh, I see no reason but supposed Lucentio

557
00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:49.530
must get a father call'd "supposed Vincentio,"

558
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:50.800
and that's a wonder.

559
00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.500
Fathers commonly do get their children,

560
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.670
but in this case of wooing,

561
00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:59.500
a child shall get a sire if I fail not of my cunning.

562
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.200
