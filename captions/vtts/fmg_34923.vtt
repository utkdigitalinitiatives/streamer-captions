WEBVTT

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
IT WAS JUST-- EVERYTHING
CAME DOWN ON HER.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Narrator:
 A TEEN, A STUDENT,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
A PARENT.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
CHILDREN HAVING CHILDREN
 NEED OUR HELP.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Woman:
 LABOR AND DELIVERY IS PROBABLY
 ONE DAY IN THEIR LIVES,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
BUT PARENTING IS FOR
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Narrator:
 TODAY, A NEW CONCEPT

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
IN SUPPORT
 FOR TEEN PARENTS

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
AND WHAT THE SCHOOLS
 THEMSELVES CAN DO.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Brazelton:
 IT TAKES A LOT OF GUTS TO GO
 BACK TO YOUR FAMILY AND SAY,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
"I NEED YOU RIGHT NOW."

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
- Narrator:
  "BRAZELTON"...
- SHE NEEDS YOU RIGHT NOW.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Narrator:
 "ON PARENTING."

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
RIGHT NOW OVER A THOUSAND
TEENAGED GIRLS

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
FIND THEMSELVES PREGNANT
EVERY DAY IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
THAT'S AN AMAZING STATISTIC.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
AND WE'VE FOUND
THAT TWO THINGS

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT
A TEEN MOTHER

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
WILL BE SUCCESSFUL
IN RAISING HER CHILD:

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
FIRST, THE SUPPORT
OF HER OWN FAMILY,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
AND SECOND, THE SUPPORT
OF HER LARGER FAMILY

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
OF SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO LOOK
AT AN EXCITING NEW APPROACH

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
TO PROVIDING
THAT SUPPORT

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
AND VISIT WITH SOME
EXTRAORDINARY YOUNG WOMEN

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
COMMITTED TO BEING
THE BEST PARENTS THEY CAN BE

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
FOR THEIR BABIES.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Brazelton:
 LAWRENCE, MASSACHUSETTS,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
- ONE OF AMERICA'S
  OLD INDUSTRIAL CITIES,
- ( bell tolling )

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
ONE THAT,
 AT FIRST GLANCE,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
TIME AND TECHNOLOGY
 SEEM TO HAVE PASSED BY.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
BUT LAWRENCE IS ACTUALLY
 HOME TO A REVOLUTION

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
IN THE TECHNOLOGY

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
OF THE HUMAN HEART.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
YOU SEE, A COALITION
 OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
HAVE COME TOGETHER
 IN A LEADING-EDGE APPROACH

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
TO HELPING
 TEEN FAMILIES.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
( siren wailing )

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
IT ALL STARTS
 WITH SOME SIMPLE TRUTHS.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Millie Robinson:
 ONCE YOU HAVE A CHILD,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
THERE'S THIS IDEA
 THAT YOU AUTOMATICALLY
 ARE BLESSED

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
WITH ALL THIS PARENTING
 KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS
 AND UNDERSTANDING OF THAT,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
AND NONE OF THAT
 IS TRUE.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
ONCE A 16-YEAR-OLD
HAS A CHILD,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
SHE DOESN'T TURN INTO
THE MOTHER OF THE CENTURY.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
WHAT SHE TURNS INTO
IS A TEEN MOM.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
SHE STILL HAS ALL THOSE
ADOLESCENT CONCERNS AND ALL
THOSE ADOLESCENT NEEDS,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
AND NOW WHAT SHE HAS IS
A CHILD IN ADDITION TO THAT.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Brazelton:
 EACH TEEN PARENT
 IS UNIQUE,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
AND SO ARE HER NEEDS.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Sharon Thompson:
 SOME OF THE GIRLS LIVE
 WITH THEIR BOYFRIENDS.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
SOME ARE MARRIED.
 SOME LIVE WITH THEIR FAMILIES.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
SOME ARE IN
VERY GOOD SITUATIONS.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
SOME ARE IN
NOT SO GOOD SITUATIONS.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
SO WE TRY AND GET TO KNOW
EACH OF THEM

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
AND WHAT THEIR ISSUES
OR CONCERNS ARE

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
AND WORK OUT A PLAN
TO WORK WITH THEM.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Brazelton:
 JENNIFER'S STORY IS TYPICAL.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Jennifer Gaznek:
 WHEN I WAS 15,
 I GOT PREGNANT WITH HER.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
YOU KNOW, I WAS 15,
 BUT I KNEW I WAS READY.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
HER FATHER AND I
 ARE FRIENDS.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
YOU KNOW, WE GET ALONG,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
AND CHIARA
VISITS WITH HIM,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
YOU KNOW,
A FEW TIMES A WEEK.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Brazelton:
 JENNIFER'S LUCKY.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
FROM THE BEGINNING,
 SHE'S HAD THE SUPPORT
 OF HER PARENTS,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
A KEY ELEMENT
 TO MAKING IT WORK.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Donna Gaznek:
I FELT THAT SHE WAS
A CHILD HAVING A CHILD,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
BUT I LEFT
THE DECISION UP TO JENNIFER
AND I BASICALLY SAID,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
"LISTEN, YOU'RE PREGNANT
WITH THIS BABY,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
AND LET'S GO FORWARD."

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I DIDN'T WANT HER
TO HAVE THE BABY ABORTED.
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
AND I DIDN'T WANT
HER TO DO ANYTHING
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DO.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I SUPPORTED HER AND SAID,
"WE'LL GET THROUGH IT."

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Brazelton:
 MANY GIRLS CAN'T LIVE AT HOME.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
MAYBE IT'S THE COLOR.
YOU WANT PURPLE?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Brazelton:
 ANOTHER COMMUNITY PROGRAM
 ACTUALLY PROVIDES HOUSING,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
EITHER IN APARTMENTS
 OR GROUP HOMES.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Robinson:
 WE PROVIDE A SAFE
 AND SECURE ENVIRONMENT

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
FOR THESE GIRLS
WHERE THEY CAN RELAX
AND REALLY LEARN AND GROW

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
AND NURTURE THEIR CHILDREN
IN A VERY HEALTHY,
SAFE ENVIRONMENT.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Brazelton:
 THE PROGRAM IS MORE THAN
 JUST A PLACE TO STAY.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Robinson: A LOT OF
 WHAT WE DO IS HELP GIRLS
 TO FILL OUT APPLICATIONS

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
AND KNOW THE PROCESS,
 HOW TO ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
IF YOU GET A PHONE BILL
THAT'S INCORRECT,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT
STRAIGHTENING THAT OUT?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
YOU DON'T JUST NOT PAY
THE BILL BECAUSE YOU'RE MAD
AT THE PHONE COMPANY--

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
YOU KNOW, THOSE KINDS
 OF THINGS.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Brazelton:
 WHATEVER THE INDIVIDUAL
 PROGRAM,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
THERE ARE COMMON GOALS
 FOR THE TEENS.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
WE STARTED THE PROGRAM
TO SEE THAT THE GIRLS

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
COULD GRADUATE
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
ALSO, AT THE SAME TIME,
WE TRY AND PREVENT
A SECOND PREGNANCY

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
BECAUSE WE FEEL,
WITH ONE CHILD,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
IT'S DIFFICULT
BUT DOABLE.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
AND ALTHOUGH
IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
TO BE SUCCESSFUL
WITH TWO CHILDREN,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
IT MAKES IT MUCH MORE
DIFFICULT TO DO THAT.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
YOU TIRED?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Thompson:
 WE LOOK AT THE GIRLS
 AND THE CHILDREN

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
AS HAVING
 TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
AND WE WANT
 TO WORK WITH THEM

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
TO GIVE THEM THE SUPPORT
THAT THEY NEED

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
TO BE SUCCESSFUL
IN WHATEVER THEY CHOOSE.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Brazelton:
 AN IMPORTANT PART
 OF EACH PROGRAM

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
IS QUALITY CHILDCARE.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Jennifer:
 I HATE LEAVING HER
 IN THE MORNING

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
'CAUSE SHE CRIES
 FOR AWHILE.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
- CALL IF YOU NEED TO.
- ( Chiara crying )

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
- CALL ME IF
  THERE'S ANY PROBLEMS.
- I'M SURE SHE'LL BE FINE.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
( laughing )

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Brazelton:
 PARENTING CLASSES
 AND COUNSELING

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
ARE ALSO CRITICAL.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Jenny Delbrey:
 THESE GIRLS LEARN PARENTING
 IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
AND THAT'S WHERE OUR ROLE
IS VERY IMPORTANT,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
ESPECIALLY
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
OUR SYSTEM, FOR EXAMPLE,
WE MEET WITH THE TEEN PARENTS

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
ONCE A WEEK AND PROVIDE
PARENTING CLASSES.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
SOMETIMES I HAVE
A CURRICULUM.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
SOMETIMES MY GROUP TAKES
 A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ROLE
 AND TURN

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
BECAUSE THEY JUST WANT
 TO SPEAK THEIR MIND.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
...HANDLING ANGER,
AND SO...

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Brazelton:
 THESE GIRLS NEED TO FEEL
 THAT THEY CAN SUCCEED.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
SOMETIMES, DURING
GROUP MEETING,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I USE MY PERSONAL LIFE
AS AN EXAMPLE AND SAY,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
"I DO KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FACING

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
BECAUSE I WAS
A TEEN PARENT."

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Brazelton:
 PROVIDING THE SUPPORT
 TEEN PARENTS NEED

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
SO THEY CAN MAKE IT
 ON THEIR OWN.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
...YOU KNOW,
WITH A BOOK...

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Brazelton:
 ONE COMMUNITY'S GIFT
 TO ALL OF US.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Delbrey:
 THESE TEENAGERS ARE
 REALLY SUCCESSFUL

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
AND THEY'RE MAKING IT
 BECAUSE THEY LOVE
 THEIR CHILDREN.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
THEY'RE REALLY
KIND OF AMAZING.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
THEY'RE STUDENTS
IN SCHOOL.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
THEY ARE RAISING
CHILDREN,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
AND THEY'RE DOING
A GREAT JOB.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
THE KIDS ARE
 INCREDIBLE CHILDREN,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
AND THEY LOVE
 THEM DEARLY.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
THEY'RE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE
 WHO DO A LOT OF THINGS,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
AND IT KIND OF AMAZES ME
 ALL THE TIME.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Brazelton:
 NEXT, THE STORY
 OF A HIGH SCHOOL

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
THAT SPECIALIZES
 IN TEEN PARENTS.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
WITH US TODAY IS
CRYSTAL HOLMES,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
OUR INTERNET EXPERT
 FROM IBM.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
WHAT RESOURCES
ARE THERE FOR PARENTS
WHO HAPPEN TO BE TEENS

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
AND WHO ARE GOING THROUGH
THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
WHILE THEY'RE TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND THEIR
CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD
RESOURCES ON THE INTERNET

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
FOR PARENTS OF ANY AGE.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
WE'LL GO TO THE AMERICAN
ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
ON THIS SITE,
 THEY HAVE A WEALTH OF
 INFORMATION FOR PARENTS

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
ON PARTICULAR
 HEALTH CARE CONCERNS.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
IF YOU'RE A TEENAGE PARENT,
 YOU'RE STILL A PARENT.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
THERE'S LOTS OF INFORMATION
AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET
FOR YOU.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
HOWEVER, IF YOU'RE HAVING
SPECIFIC CHALLENGES BECAUSE
YOU ARE A TEENAGER,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
DON'T HESITATE
TO GET SUPPORT

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
FROM YOUR LOCAL
FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER
OR FROM A COUNSELOR.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
EVERYTHING WE KNOW
ABOUT TEENAGE PARENTING

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
SHOWS US THAT IF TEENAGERS
HAVE SUPPORT,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
THEY CAN DO THE BEST JOB
BY THEIR KIDS

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
THAT YOU CAN EXPERIENCE.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000

 NEW YORK CITY
 HAS DEVELOPED

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
A SPECIAL APPROACH
 TO KEEPING ITS TEEN PARENTS

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
IN SCHOOL--

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
A NETWORK OF HIGH SCHOOLS
 DEVOTED SOLELY TO TEEN PARENTS.

Donald K. Amaker:
 WE'RE JUST ONE SCHOOL

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
IN A PROGRAM THAT CONSISTS
 OF FIVE SCHOOLS.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
THERE'S A REAL MARKET

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
FOR SCHOOLS FOR GIRLS
WHO ARE PREGNANT AND GIRLS
WHO ARE PARENTING,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
AND WE'RE HERE TO SORT OF
SERVE THEIR PARTICULAR NEED.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Brazelton:
 ONSITE CHILDCARE
 IS THE FIRST THING

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
THESE KIDS NEED
 TO STAY IN SCHOOL.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
SONIA IS
 A TYPICAL STUDENT.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Sonia:
 IT'S TOUGH HAVING A KID.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
IT'S HARD WORK,
 A BIG RESPONSIBILITY.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
HER FATHER'S
 NOT IN THE PICTURE.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I HAVE TO SACRIFICE
 FOR MYSELF AND FOR HER.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
IN THIS PARTICULAR BUILDING,
WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
FOR HANDLING ABOUT
20 INFANTS, 20 TODDLERS,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
STAFFED BY A GROUP

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
OF LICENSED
 PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
DID SHE HAVE
A GOOD NIGHT?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Brazelton:
 WHILE EVERY COMMUNITY
 IN THE COUNTRY DOESN'T HAVE

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
THE RESOURCES TO CREATE
 A SPECIAL SCHOOL,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
THE PRINCIPLES YOU'LL SEE
 HERE CAN APPLY ANYWHERE.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
( indistinct chatter )

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
IT'S VERY HARD.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
RAISING A BABY IS
NO JOKE AT ALL.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
BUT I CAN COME AND CHECK
 ON HIM WHENEVER I WANT.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
THE SCHOOL IS SMALL,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
SO IT'S EASY TO KNOW
 ALL THE TEACHERS.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Amaker:
 IT'S ALSO STAFFED BY WHAT
 WE CALL A "LIFE TEACHER"

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
WHO DOES
A VERY EFFECTIVE JOB
AT TEACHING THE BABIES,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
PLAYING WITH THE BABIES,
READING TO THE BABIES,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
INTRODUCING THE BABIES
TO THE WHOLE SOCIALIZING
PROCESS.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
JORDAN WAS PROUD
OF HIMSELF...

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Brazelton:
 I BELIEVE THAT EVERY SCHOOL
 SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE ONE,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
NOT ONLY TO HELP
 THE YOUNG MOMS,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
BUT FOR CHILD
 DEVELOPMENT CLASSES

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
TO HELP ALL TEENS LEARN
 ABOUT BABIES FIRSTHAND.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
- YAY, JORDAN!
- CAN YOU CLAP YOUR HAND?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Amaker:
 A TYPICAL DAY,
 THE GIRLS COME IN,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
AND IF THEIR BABIES ARE
 INVOLVED IN THE LIFE CENTER,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
THEY GET THEIR BABIES
READY FOR THE DAY,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
WHICH CONSISTS OF
CHANGING THEIR CLOTHES,
PREPARING THEIR BOTTLES.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Woman:
 BYE-BYE!

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
STASHA, BYE-BYE!

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
- BYE!
- MISS JONES,
  I'M LEAVING.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
- YEAH.
- Jones: ...REPORT
  AND SIGNED IN?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
OKAY, WE'LL SEE
 YOU LATER.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
BYE.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Brazelton:
 ONCE THE SCHOOL
 DAY BEGINS,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
THE TEENS ARE EXPECTED
 TO PERFORM JUST LIKE
 ANY OTHER STUDENT.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Man:
 A BOOK CALLED
 "A MEDIEVAL HOME COMPANION:

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
A GUIDEBOOK FOR WOMEN."

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Girl:
 "ALL THE SPECIAL PLEASURES,
 GREATEST DESIRES

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
AND PERFECT JOYS
ARE IN PLEASING
AND OBEYING EACH OTHER."

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
HERE, HE'S TELLING US
TO LOOK TO NATURE

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
TO DESCRIBE
THE PROPER...

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Brazelton: 
 THIS IS NOT
 A SECOND-CLASS EDUCATION.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE
ABOUT THE SCIENTIFIC NOTATION

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
IS IT KEEPS
YOU FROM WRITING
ALL THE EXCESS ZEROES

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
AND THE EXCESS NUMBERS.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
( laughter, chatter )

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Teacher:
 IT'S RIGHT FOR THE...

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Brazelton:
 THESE TEENS DO HAVE
 SPECIAL ISSUES

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
WHICH EVERY HIGH SCHOOL
 SHOULD TRY TO UNDERSTAND
 AND SUPPORT.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP
 COUNSELING

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
IS SCHEDULED
 FOR EVERY STUDENT.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN
YOU TOLD YOUR MOTHER...

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Brazelton:
 THESE KIDS HAVE GONE
 THROUGH A LOT.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
...OR THE BABY'S FATHER

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
- THAT YOU ARE PREGNANT.
  WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?
- Brazelton: JUST LISTEN.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I WAS TERRIFIED
TO TELL MY MOTHER.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I DIDN'T TELL HER.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I FOUND OUT WHEN I WAS THREE
MONTHS THAT I WAS PREGNANT,
AND I DIDN'T TELL HER.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I TOLD HER
INTO MY FIFTH MONTH.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
SHE WAS LIKE, "YOU
CAN'T STAY HERE ANYMORE.
I'M GOING TO DISOWN YOU."

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
BUT SHE GOT OVER THAT.
IT'S LIKE SHE'S HAPPY NOW.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
MAYBE SHE WAS MAD BECAUSE
I WAS STILL IN SCHOOL.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTED ME
TO DO-- TO FINISH SCHOOL.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I DIDN'T SHOW AT ALL.
I STARTED SHOWING
ONCE I TOLD HER.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
I THOUGHT THAT
MY KID WAS HIDING,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
LIKE FEARING--
THE FEAR I FELT,
I FELT IT FELT THE FEAR.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I HAD A FEAR OF TELLING
MY BOYFRIEND'S MOTHER,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
WHO WE KEPT IT FROM
FOR AWHILE.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
WE DIDN'T WANT TO TELL HER,
BUT SHE SAID SHE FIGURED IT
OUT BY HERSELF

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
BECAUSE MY EATING
HABITS CHANGED.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
SO EVERYBODY KNOWS NOW.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
HE TOOK IT COOL.
HE WAS LIKE, "I'M GOING
TO BE A GRANDFATHER.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
OH, MY GOD, AT 33,
I'M GOING TO BE
A GRANDFATHER!"

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
- HOW ARE YOU ALL GOING TO
  TAKE CARE OF THIS CHILD?
- WE GOT TO GET A JOB.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Brazelton:
 THE SCHOOL HAS TRAINED
 SENSITIVE TEACHERS,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
PEOPLE THE GIRLS
 CAN TRUST.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
- HE'S HAPPY.
- OKAY, IS HE MAKING
  ANY PREPARATIONS

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
- TO SUPPORT THE CHILD
  AND YOU FINANCIALLY?
- YES.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
( overlapping dialogue )

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Brazelton:
 THE SCHOOL HAS BEEN
 A GREAT SUCCESS.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Amaker:
 ORDINARILY, THE GIRLS
 ARE ALLOWED

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
TO STAY FOR 18 MONTHS.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I CAN'T BEGIN TO COUNT
 THE NUMBER OF TIMES

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
AND THE NUMBER
 OF GIRLS

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
WHO HAVE LITERALLY
 BEGGED US TO BE ALLOWED
 TO STAY HERE

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
FOR MORE THAN
 THE 18 MONTHS.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Brazelton:
 THESE GIRLS HAVE DREAMS

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
LIKE ANY OTHER
 HIGH SCHOOL TEEN,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
SOMETHING EVERY SCHOOL
 SHOULD ENCOURAGE.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Jiselle:
 AND I DO SEE MYSELF

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH
 SOMETHING.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
I WANT TO WAKE UP
 EVERY DAY,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
AND WAKE UP TO SOMETHING
 I LOVE DOING.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I WANT TO BE A DOCTOR.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I KNOW I GOTTA GET GOOD GRADES
IN ORDER TO GET MYSELF
INTO A COLLEGE,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
TO START PREPARING MYSELF
 TO BECOME A DOCTOR.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Brazelton:
 A LOVE OF LEARNING,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
A LOVE OF CHILDREN,
 A LOVE OF LIFE.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I WANT TO WAKE UP
TO SOMETHING I LOVE.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
I WANT TO WAKE UP
TO THE PASSION I HAVE.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Brazelton:
 NEXT, WE TALK TO PARENTS

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Woman:
 WE'VE SOLD OUT.
 WE HAVE OVER 900 PEOPLE...

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Brazelton:
 EACH YEAR WE TRAVEL
 ALL OVER AMERICA...

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Man:
 OUR COMMUNITY IS
 SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Brazelton:
 ...TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
 FROM THOUSANDS OF PARENTS.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Emcee:
 I'D LIKE TO WELCOME
 DR. T. BERRY BRAZELTON.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Brazelton:
 HERE ARE SOME OF THEM.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
HOW YOU DOIN'?
I HAD A QUESTION

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
ABOUT CONNECTING
AND BONDING.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
YOU HAD TOUCHED UPON THE FACT
THAT FATHERS DEVELOP A BOND
WITH THE CHILDREN.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
THEY'RE ALWAYS
PLAYING WITH THEM.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
- WHEN THEY SEE THE FATHER,
  THEY GET EXCITED AND HAPPY.
- ISN'T THAT FUN?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
- YEAH, IT'S FUN.
- ( all laughing )

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
- YOU LOOK LIKE
  YOU ENJOY IT, TOO.
- I HAVE A GOOD TIME.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
I'LL BET THAT BOY
SURE ENJOYS IT.
IS IT A BOY?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
YEAH, TWO BOYS.
 I'M A FATHER OF TWO.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
SAY, FOR INSTANCE,
THERE WAS A SITUATION WHERE

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
A MOTHER
HAD TO BE ABSENT

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
AND THE FATHER WAS
REALLY THE ONLY ONE

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
THAT HAD TO TAKE OVER
THE ROLE NOW,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
WOULD A CHILD BE ABLE
TO SWITCH FROM

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
ALWAYS EXPECTING
TO PLAY AND BE HAPPY

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
AND EXPECTING THE FUN--

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
TO SEE YOU IN ANOTHER WAY?
ARE YOU A SINGLE PARENT?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
- YES.
- GOOD FOR YOU.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
I WAS WONDERING,
WOULD A BABY BE
ABLE TO ADJUST

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
- TO THE NEW BOND
  WITH THE FATHER?
- YEAH.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
WHAT KIND OF EFFECTS
WOULD IT HAVE ON THE CHILD

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
TO LOSE THE BOND
WITH THE MOTHER?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
WELL, IT HAS SOME
PRETTY POWERFUL EFFECTS,
TO LOSE YOUR MOTHER.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
AND YOU ALWAYS WONDER,
"IF I'VE LOST ONE PARENT,
WILL I LOSE THE OTHER?"

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
SO YOU SHOULD BE
 PREPARED ALL THE TIME

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
FOR THEM TO BRING UP
QUESTIONS--

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
"ARE YOU GOING OFF
TO LEAVE ME?"

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
AND IF YOU GO OFF TO WORK,
"ARE YOU COMING BACK?"

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
AND RATHER THAN
GETTING EXASPERATED
WITH THAT QUESTION,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
REALIZE THAT THEY NEED IT
TO REASSURE THEMSELVES

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
THAT YOU CARE
DEEPLY ABOUT THEM.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
AND WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE,
I'D EVEN SAY THAT
ABOUT THEIR MOMMY--

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
"SHE'S GONE OFF,
AND WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE IS,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
BUT I'LL BET SHE MISSES
YOU LIKE EVERYTHING."

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
SO, YOU KNOW, GIVE THEM
BACK THAT FEELING

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
THEY'RE SURROUNDED
BY PEOPLE

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
WHO CARE ABOUT THEM,
AND THEY ARE.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
LOOK AT THE WAY
 YOU TALK ABOUT 'EM.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
AND I LOVE THE SENSITIVITY
OF YOUR QUESTION.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
SURE, THEY WILL.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
THEY'LL FIND NOT ONLY
THEY PLAY WITH YOU,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
WHICH YOU ENJOY
AND THEY ENJOY,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
BUT THEY'LL ALSO FIND
THE OTHER SIDE OF YOU,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
THE NURTURING SIDE,
AND THEY'LL PLAY ON IT.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
AND THEY'LL WANT YOU
TO CUDDLE 'EM,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
AND WANT YOU TO SING
TO 'EM AT NIGHT,
OR READ TO 'EM AT NIGHT.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
AND I WOULD
GIVE IN TO THAT

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
AND BE AS NURTURING
AS YOU CAN.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
 IT MAKES YOU FEEL
 UNCOMFORTABLE OR NOT

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
WHEN YOU HAVE TO
 BE LIKE THAT.  GOOD.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
ANOTHER THING WAS THAT
YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT ROLES
OF A FATHER AND A MOTHER,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
AND THE WAY THE FATHER
HAS TO COME UP AND SHOW
THE CHILD THE WORLD.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
CAN A FATHER SWITCH
ROLES AND RAISE

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
A HEALTHY, MENTALLY
AND PHYSICALLY, CHILD?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
- YEAH.
- HE CAN?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
IT'S FASCINATING
TO ME THAT A CHILD
IN A SINGLE-PARENT FAMILY

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
WILL LOOK FOR
TWO SEPARATE ROLES
IN THE PARENT,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
AND IF THEY DON'T FIND
ENOUGH OF THAT ROLE,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
THEY'LL LOOK OUTSIDE
AND SHOW SOME HUNGER.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T FEEL
UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT
DOING IT WITH THEM,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
THEY'RE LUCKY,
LUCKY KIDS.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
SO KEEP IT UP.
 I'LL BET HE LOOKS TO YOU

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
FOR WAYS TO MASTER THINGS
ANYWAY, DOESN'T HE?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
- YEAH.
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
- DOESN'T THAT MAKE
  YOU FEEL GOOD?
- IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
I DON'T LIKE TO KEEP
TOUCHING ON THE SIDE
THAT I'M VERY SENSITIVE

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
BECAUSE IT KIND OF
FEELS WEIRD WHEN YOU SAY,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
- "THIS MAN IS
  VERY SENSITIVE."
- ( audience laughs )

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Brazelton: DO YOU FEEL LIKE
 YOU'RE TAKING A MOTHER'S
 ROLE AWAY FROM HER?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
- YEAH, SOMETIMES.
- DO YOU?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
YOU KNOW, TO ME
THAT'S THE PASSION

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
OF WANTING TO GIVE
THIS LITTLE BOY
EVERYTHING YOU CAN.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
THAT IS SO GREAT.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
AND HE'S LEARNING
NURTURING FROM YOU

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
AS WELL AS LEARNING
HOW TO BE A MAN.
IT COULDN'T BE BETTER.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I GUESS THE NURTURING PART
 COMES FROM THE ABSENCE
 OF MY FATHER.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
SO KNOWING WHAT I NEEDED
IS WHAT I GIVE TO HIM NOW.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
SO YOU'RE REALLY
DOING EVERYTHING YOU CAN
FOR THIS KID, AREN'T YOU?

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
I'M TRYING TO.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
GREAT.
 I REALLY ADMIRE YOU.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
HI.  MY NAME'S DANIELE.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
I'M CONCERNED IF THERE'S
 ANY LONG-TERM EFFECTS

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
IF WE MOVE AROUND A LOT,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
MOVED A LOT, LIKE,
FROM PLACE TO PLACE

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
SINCE THE CHILD
WAS BORN.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
SHE'S EIGHT MONTHS OLD NOW.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
ARE YOU A SINGLE MOTHER?

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
- NO.
- NO?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
WELL, WHY ARE YOU
 MOVING AROUND?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
WELL, I LIVE
WITH A BOYFRIEND,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
BUT WE'RE NOT MARRIED.
WE LIVE WITH HIS FAMILY.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
IS IT A STABLE SITUATION
BETWEEN YOU?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
- NOT SO SURE?
- NOT REALLY.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
SO YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
THAT, TOO, AREN'T YOU?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
YEAH.  I'M JUST CONCERNED
IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT--

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
IS SHE GOING
TO BE INSECURE?

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN
AFFECT HER DOWN THE ROAD

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE...

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
THAT STABLE
LIVING ENVIRONMENT

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
IF WE CONTINUE TO MOVE
FROM PLACE TO PLACE?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
WELL, SURE.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
THAT'S A STRESS ON HER
AND, OF COURSE,
IT IS ON YOU, TOO,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
'CAUSE IT'S MORE
OF A STRESS ON YOU.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
I CAN FEEL YOUR EMOTION
AS YOU TALK ABOUT IT.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
SO I DON'T THINK
 YOU'RE HAVING

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
A VERY EASY TIME WITH IT
 EITHER, ARE YOU?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
- IT'S DIFFICULT.
- MM-HMM.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I'M BASICALLY MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT THE MOVING AROUND

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
AND NOT HAVING
ANYTHING STABLE,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
IF THAT'S GONNA
AFFECT HER.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
I DON'T THINK IT'S THE HOME
THAT'S THE STABILITY.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
I THINK IT'S
THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT IS.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
SO THE MORE SECURE
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER IS,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
AND HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
AND EVEN HIS FAMILY'S
RELATIONSHIP--

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
- YOUR FAMILY
  IS NOT NEARBY?
- NO.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
AND YOU MISS 'EM?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
THEY DON'T LIVE
THAT FAR AWAY, BUT WE'RE
JUST NOT THAT CLOSE.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Brazelton: 
 AND YOU WISH
 THAT YOU WERE.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
THIS IS WHAT A BABY
CALLS UP IN YOU, ISN'T IT?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
THAT YOU WISH YOU COULD GET
BACK TO YOUR OWN PARENTS

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
AND GET THEM
 TO NURTURE YOU.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
IT'S REALLY HARD
 WHEN YOU CAN'T,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE
 MISSING, ISN'T IT?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
MM-HMM.
BUT YOU KNOW

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
WHO'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
TO THAT BABY?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
YOU.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
AND THE WAY
YOUR FACE LIGHTS UP,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
AND THE WAY YOU, YOU KNOW,
 ARE SO CONCERNED ABOUT HER,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
I KNOW SHE'S GOT
 MONEY IN THE BANK.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
SHE'S A LUCKY
 LITTLE GIRL.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
- THANKS.
- YOU DON'T LOOK
  LIKE YOU BELIEVE IT.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
I DO.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
SO THERE ISN'T, LIKE,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
MUCH SERIOUS LONG-TERM
EFFECTS WITH--

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
AS LONG AS HER FAMILY--
AS LONG AS WE'RE
CLOSE TO HER

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
AND SHE'S
WELL TAKEN CARE OF,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
EVERYTHING'S
PRETTY MUCH OKAY?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
WELL, THE FIRST FEW YEARS
ARE THE MOST CRITICAL.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
AND THE MORE YOU CAN
SURROUND HER WITH PEOPLE
WHO CARE ABOUT HER--

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
AND LET THEM
LET HER KNOW IT--
THE SURER SHE'LL BE,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
AND WHATEVER
SORT OF BUFFETING

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
SHE HAS TO GO
THROUGH LATER,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
SHE'LL BE
READIER FOR IT.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
OKAY.  THANK YOU.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Brazelton:
 FOR TAPES AND
 TRANSCRIPTS, CALL:

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
OR LOG ON AT:

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
ON PARENTING,"

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
PRESENTED BY THE PARENTING
 INSTITUTE AT PAMPERS.COM.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
YOU KNOW,
THE OLD SAYING IS

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
"CHILDREN RAISING CHILDREN,"

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
AND IN SOME RESPECTS
THAT'S TRUE.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
BUT I HOPE YOU'VE SEEN THAT,
GIVEN A CHANCE,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE
CAN TURN OUT TO BE
WONDERFUL PARENTS,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
AND THEIR CHILDREN,
WONDERFUL KIDS.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
IT'S UP TO US NOT TO LABEL
THEM WITH OUR BIASES

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
BUT TO UNDERSTAND THEM
AND HELP THEM

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
BY OFFERING THEM
AND THEIR CHILDREN

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
THE SUPPORT THEY NEED
TO SUCCEED.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
