00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.370
I have seen them in the churchtogether.

3
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.770
God send 'em goodshipping.

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.870
Ah!

5
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.330
Ay that; who's here?

6
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.270
Mine old master Vincentio.

7
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.500
Now we are undone andbrought to nothing.

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.870
Come hither, crack-hemp.

9
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.330

10
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.070
Come hither, you rogue.

11
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.900
What, have you forgot me?

12
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.030
Forgot you?

13
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.200
Oh, no, sir, I could notforget you, sir.

14
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.930
I never saw you before inall my life.

15
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.730
What, you notoriousvillain,

16
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.330
didst thou never see thymaster's father, Vincentio?

17
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.570
What, my old worshipfulold master?

18
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.830
Oh, marry, sir, yes.

19
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.870
See where he looks out ofthe window.

20
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.870
Is't so, indeed.

21
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.500
Help, help, help!

22
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.430
Here's a madman willmurder me.

23
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.730
Help, son. Help, SigniorBaptista!

24
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.300
Prithee, Kate, let's standaside

25
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.170
and see the end of thiscontroversy.

26
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.600
Sir, what are you thatoffer to beat my servant?

27
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.930
Ah!

28
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.030
What am I, sir?

29
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.030
Nay, what are you, sir?

30
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.500
O immortal gods, O finevillain,

31
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.230
a silken doublet, a velvethose, a scarlet cloak,

32
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.400
and a copatain hat.

33
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.700
O, I am undone. I amundone.

34
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.470
While I play the goodhusband at home,

35
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.530
my son and my servant spendall at the university.

36
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.200
How now, what's thematter?

37
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.730
Why, is the man lunatic?

38
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.000
Sir, you seem a sober ancientgentleman by your habit,

39
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.100
but your words show you amadman.

40
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.200
Why, sir, what 'cerns it youif I wear pearl and gold?

41
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.100
I thank my good father Iam able to maintain it.

42
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.530
Thy father?

43
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.900
O villain, he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.

44
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.000
You mistake, sir.

45
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.230
You mistake, sir.

46
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.070
Pray, what do you think ishis name?

47
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.700
His name? As if I knew nothis name.

48
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.200
I have brought him up eversince he was three years old,

49
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.970
and his name is Tranio.

50
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.100
Away, away, mad ass!

51
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.930
His name is Lucentio.

52
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.230
He is mine only son

53
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.370
and heir to the lands ofme, Signior Vincentio.

54
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.770
Lucentio.

55
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.730
O, he hath murdered hismaster.

56
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.770
Lay hold on him, I chargeyou, in the duke's name.

57
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.230
O, my son, my son.

58
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.500
Tell me, thou villain,where is my son Lucentio?

59
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.070
Call forth an officer.

60
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.900
Carry this mad knave tothe jail.

61
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.530
Father Baptista, I chargeyou, see he be forthcoming.

62
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.800
Carry me to the jail?

63
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.730
Stay, officer, he shallnot go to prison.

64
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.430
Talk not, Signior Gremio.

65
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.970
I say he shall go toprison.

66
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.500
Take heed, SigniorBaptista,

67
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.530
lest you be cony-catchedin this business.

68
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.730
I dare swear this is theright Vincentio.

69
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.430
Swear, if thou darest,hmm?

70
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.830
Nay, I dare not swear it.

71
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.530
Then thou wert best saythat I am not Lucentio.

72
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.630
Yes, I know thee to beSignior Lucentio.

73
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.500
Away with the dotard.

74
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.970
To the jail with him.

75
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.230
Thus strangers may behailed and abused!

76
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.430
O monstrous villain!

77
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.030
O, we are spoiled, andyonder, he is.

78
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.370
Deny him, forswear him, orelse we are all undone.

79
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.700
Pardon, sweet father.

80
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.000
Lives my sweet son?

81
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.630
Pardon, dear father.

82
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.130
How hast thou offended?

83
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.100
Where is Lucentio?

84
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.000
Here's Lucentio,

85
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.430
right son to the rightVincentio

86
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.870
that have by marriage madethy daughter mine

87
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.530
while counterfeit supposesbleared thine eyne.

88
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.770
Here's packing,

89
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.570
with a witness to deceiveus all.

90
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.300
Where is that damnedvillain Tranio

91
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.400
that faced and braved mein this matter so?

92
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.370
Why, tell me, is this notmy Cambio?

93
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.130
Cambio has changed intoLucentio.

94
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.900
Love wrought thesemiracles.

95
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.500
Bianca's love made meexchange my state with Tranio

96
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.570
while he did bear mycountenance in the town,

97
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.000
and happily, I havearrived at the last

98
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.700
unto the wished haven ofmy bliss.

99
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.900
But, I--

100
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.330
What Tranio did, myselfenforced him to.

101
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.530
Then pardon him, sweetfather, for my sake.

102
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.470
I'll slit the villain'snose

103
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.170
that would have sent me tothe jail.

104
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.570
But do you hear, sir?

105
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.170
Have you married mydaughter without asking mygood will?

106
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.370
Fear not, Baptista, wewill content you, go to,

107
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.770
but I will in to berevenged for this villainy.

108
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.730
And I, to sound the depthof this knavery.

109
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.970
Look not pale, Bianca.

110
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.230
Thy father will not frown.

111
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.970
My cake is dough,

112
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.130
but I'll in among the rest

113
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.130
out of hope of all but myshare of the feast.

114
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.100
Husband, let's follow tosee the end of this ado.

115
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.800
First, kiss me, Kate, andwe will.

116
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.330
What, here?

117
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.870
In the midst of thestreet?

118
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.670
What, art thou ashamed ofme?

119
00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.830
No, sir, God forbid, butashamed to kiss.

120
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.830
Why, then, let's homeagain.

121
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.070
Come, sirrah, let's away.

122
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.730
Nay, I will give thee akiss.

123
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:29.800
Now, pray thee, love,stay.

124
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.470
Is this not well?

125
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.570
Come, my sweet Kate.

126
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.630
Better once than never,for never too late.

127
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.500
At last, though long, ourjarring notes agree,

128
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.700
and time it is when ragingwar is done

129
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.800
to smile at scapes andperils overblown.

130
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.200
My fair Bianca, bid myfather welcome

131
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.300
while I with self-samekindness welcome thine.

132
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.470
Brother Petruchio, sisterKatharina,

133
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.500
and thou, Hortensio, withthy loving widow,

134

135
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.400
Now, then--

136
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.400
Pray you, sit down,

137
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.000
for now we sit to chat aswell as eat.

138
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.900
Nothing but sit and sitand eat and eat.

139
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.170
Padua affords thiskindness, son Petruchio.

140
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.200
Padua affords nothing butwhat is kind.

141
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.470
Here, here. Here, here.

142
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.000
For both our sakes, Iwould that word were true.

143
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.500
Now, for my life,Hortensio fears his widow.

144
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.330
Never trust me if I beafeard.

145
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.630
You are very sensible, andyet, you miss my sense.

146
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.770
I mean, Hortensio isafeard of you.

147
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.330
He that is giddy thinksthe world turns round.

148
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.770
Roundly replied.

149
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.470
Mistress, how mean youthat?

150
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.100
Thus I conceive by him.

151
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.370
Conceives by me.

152
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.730
How likes Hortensio that?

153
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.200
My widow says, thus sheconceives her tale.

154
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.700
Very well mended.

155
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.370
Kiss him for that, goodwidow.

156
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.970
"He that is giddy thinksthe world turns round."

157
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.070
I pray you, tell me whatyou meant by that.

158
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.670
Your husband, beingtroubled with a shrew--

159
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.070
Ooh--

160
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.100
measures my husband'ssorrow by his woe,

161
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.930
and now you know mymeaning.

162
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.100
A very mean meaning.

163
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.430
Right, I mean you.

164
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.130
And I am mean indeed,respecting you.

165
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.370
To her, Kate.

166
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.470
To her, widow.

167
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.600
A hundred marks, my Katedoes put her down.

168
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.730
That's my office.

169
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.930
Spoke like an officer.

170
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.030
Ha' to thee, lad.

171
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.170
How likes Gremio thesequick-witted folks?

172
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.930
Believe me, sir, they butttogether well.

173
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.300
A head and butt-- anhasty-witted body

174
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.030
would say your head andbutt were head and horn.

175
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.000
Ay, mistress bride, haththat awaken'd you?

176
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.300
Ay, but not frighted me.

177
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:44.930
Therefore, I'll sleepagain.

178
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.130
Nay, that you shall not.

179
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.230
Since you have begun,

180
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.170
have at you for a bitterjest or two.

181
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.300
Am I your bird?

182
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.400
Then, I mean to shift mybush,

183
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.800
and then pursue me as youdraw your bow.

184
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.870
You are welcome, all.

185
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.370
She hath prevented me.

186
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.670
Here, Signior Tranio.

187
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.830
This bird you aim'd at,though you hit her not.

188
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.070
Therefore, a health to allthat shot and miss'd.

189
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.300
Shot and missed!

190
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.970
O, sir, Lucentio slipp'dme like his greyhound

191
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.630
which runs himself andcatches for his master.

192
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.400
A good swift simile, butsomething currish.

193
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.570
Oh!

194
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.870
'Tis well, sir, that youhunted for yourself.

195
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.370
'Tis thought your deerdoes hold you at a bay.

196
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.100
O ho, Petruchio.

197
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.970
I thank thee for thatgird, good Tranio.

198
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.100
Confess, confess, hath henot hit you here?

199
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.200
A' has a little gall'd me,I confess,

200
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.770
and as the jest did glanceaway from me,

201
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.170
'tis ten to one it maim'dyou two outright.

202
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.530
Now, in good sadness, sonPetruchio,

203
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.170
I think thou hast theveriest shrew of all.

204
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:51.030
Well, I say no, andtherefore, for assurance,

205
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.400
let's each one send untohis wife,

206
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.200
and he whose wife is mostobedient

207
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.230
to come at first when hedoth send for her

208
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.630
shall win the wager whichwe will propose.

209
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.000
Content. What is thewager?

210
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.200
20 crowns.

211
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.600
20 crowns?

212
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.470
I'll venture so much of myhawk or hound

213
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.030
but 20 times so much uponmy wife.

214
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.200
A hundred then.

215
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.300
Content.

216
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.430
A match; 'tis done.

217
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:12.600
Who shall begin?

218
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.100
That will I.

219
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.200
Go, Biondello, bid yourmistress come to me.

220
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.470
I go.

221
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.000
Son, I'll be your half,Bianca comes.

222
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.470
I'll have no halves.

223
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.370
I'll bear it all myself.

224
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.600
How now, what news?

225
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.400
Sir, my mistress sends youword

226
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.170
that she is busy, and shecannot come.

227
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:35.270
How, she is busy, and shecannot come.

228
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.730
I-Is that an answer?

229
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.900
Ay, and a kind one too.

230
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.570
Pray God, sir, your wifesend you not a worse.

231
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:43.700
I hope better.

232
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.700
Sirrah Biondello, go andentreat my wife

233
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.900
to come to me forthwith.

234
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.000
O, ho, entreat her.

235
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.670
Nay, then she must needscome.

236
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.030
Sir, I am afraid,

237
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.130
do what you can, yourswill not be entreated.

238
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.130
Now, where's my wife?

239
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.930
Ah, she says you have somegoodly jest in hand.

240
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.330
She will not come.

241
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.470
She bids you come to her.

242
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.700
Whoa!

243
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.630
Worse and worse; she willnot come.

244
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.430
O vile, intolerable, notto be endured.

245
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.800
Sirrah Grumio,

246
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.400
go to your mistress.

247
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.030
Say I command her come tome.

248
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.400
I know her answer.

249
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.630
What?

250
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:18.730
She will not.

251
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.630
The fouler fortune mine,and there an end.

252
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:35.230
Now, by my holidame, herecomes Katharina.

253
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.100
What is your will, sir,that you send for me?

254
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.370
Where is your sister andHortensio's wife?

255
00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.870
They sit conferring by theparlor fire.

256
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.300
Go fetch them hither.

257
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.730
If they deny to come,

258
00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.300
swinge me them soundlyforth unto their husbands.

259
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.330
Away, I say, and bringthem hither straight.

260
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.030
Here is a wonder, if youtalk of a wonder.

261
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.270
And so it is.

262
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.530
I wonder what it bodes.

263
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:22.770
Marry,

264
00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.630
peace it bodes

265
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.800
and love and quiet life

266
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.830
and awful rule and rightsupremacy

267
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:36.600
and, to be short, what notthat's sweet and happy?

268
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.930
Now, fair befall thee,good Petruchio,

269
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.130
the wager thou hast won,

270
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.270
and I will add unto theirlosses 20,000 crowns,

271
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.630
another dowry to anotherdaughter,

272
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:53.130
for she is changed as shehas never been.

273
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.430
Nay, I will win my wagerbetter yet

274
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:01.870
and show more sign of herobedience,

275
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.670
her new-built virtue andobedience.

276
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:08.930
See where she comes andbrings your froward wives

277
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.470
as prisoners to herwomanly persuasion.

278
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.930
Katharine...

279
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:22.430
that cap of yours becomesyou not.

280
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.370
Off with that bauble.

281
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.030
Throw it underfoot.

282
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.100
Lord, let me never have acause to sigh

283
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.500
till I be brought to sucha silly pass.

284
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.800
Fie, what foolish dutycall you this?

285
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.900
I would your duty were asfoolish too.

286
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.670
The wisdom of your duty,fair Bianca,

287
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.430
hath cost me an hundredcrowns since supper time.

288
00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.400
The more fool you forlaying on my duty.

289
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.730
Katharine, I charge thee,tell these headstrong women

290
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.670
what duty they do owetheir lords and husbands.

291
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.270
Come, come, you'remocking.

292
00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:09.800
We will have no telling.

293
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.030
Come on, I say, and firstbegin with her.

294
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.930
She shall not.

295
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.130
I say she shall!

296
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.300
Ooh!

297
00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.530
And first, begin with her.

298
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.230
Fie, fie.

299
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:24.400
Unknit that threatening,unkind brow,

300
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.200
and dart not scornfulglances from those eyes

301
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.700
to wound thy lord, thyking, thy governor.

302
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.870
It blots thy beauty asfrosts do bite the meads,

303
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.770
confounds thy fame aswhirlwinds shake fair buds,

304
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.900
and in no sense is meet oramiable.

305
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.500
A woman moved is like afountain troubled--

306
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:51.400
muddy, ill-seeming, thick,bereft of beauty--

307
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.000
and while it is so, noneso dry or thirsty

308
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.470
will deign to sip or touchone drop of it.

309
00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:02.570
Thy husband is thy lord,thy life, thy keeper,

310
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.670
thy head, thy sovereign,one that cares for thee,

311
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.700
and for thy maintenancecommits his body

312
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.100
to painful labor both bysea and land

313
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.770
to watch the night instorms, the day in cold,

314
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.970
whilst thou liest warm athome, secure and safe,

315
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.500
that craves no othertribute from thy hands

316
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:28.130
but love, fair looks, andtrue obedience--

317
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.930
too little payment for sogreat a debt.

318
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.900
Such duty as the subjectowes the prince

319
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.000
even such a woman oweth toher husband,

320
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.400
and when she's froward,peevish, sullen, sour,

321
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.930
and not obedient to hishonest will,

322
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.930
what is she but a foulcontending rebel

323
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:58.200
and graceless traitor toher loving lord?

324
00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.100
I am ashamed that womenare so simple

325
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.270
to offer war where theyshould kneel for peace,

326
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.330
to seek for rule,supremacy, and sway

327
00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:15.870
when they are bound toserve, love, and obey.

328
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:19.570
Why are our bodies softand weak and smooth,

329
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.600
unapt to toil and troublein the world

330
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.100
but that our softconditions and our hearts

331
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.800
should well agree with ourexternal parts?

332
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:35.300
Come, come, you frowardand unable worms.

333
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.370
My mind hath been as bigas one of yours,

334
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:41.870
my heart as great, myreason haply more,

335
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:45.270
to bandy word for word andfrown for frown,

336
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:50.230
but now I see our lancesare but straws,

337
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:54.900
our strength as weak, ourweakness past compare,

338
00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:01.330
that seeming to be mostwhich we indeed least are.

339
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:06.670
Then vail your stomachs,for it is no boot,

340
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:12.230
and place your hands belowyour husband's foot.

341
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:17.170
In token of which duty, ifhe please,

342
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.530
my hand is ready.

343
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.770
May it do him ease.

344
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.700
Why, there's a wench.

345
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.000
Come on, and kiss me,Kate.

346
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:48.930
Well, go thy ways, oldlad, for thou shalt ha't.

347
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.600
'Tis a good hearing whenchildren are toward--

348
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.830
But a harsh hearing whenwomen are froward.

349
00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.600
Come, Kate, we'll to bed.

350
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.670
We three are married, butyou two are sped.

351
00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.770
Now, go thy ways.

352
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.800
Thou hast tamed a cursedshrew.

353
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.430
'Tis a wonder, by yourleave, she will be tamed so.

354
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.000
Hmmm.

355
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.700
Hmmm.

356
00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.730
Hmmm.

357
00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:38.930
How blessed is he thatfears the Lord

358
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:43.330
and walketh, walketh inhis ways.

359
00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:47.530
