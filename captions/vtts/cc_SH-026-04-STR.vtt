145
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.600
WHAT?

146
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.730

[thunder rumbling]

153
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.030
MY FORMER SPEECHES HAVE BUT HIT YOUR THOUGHTS,

154
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.200
WHICH CAN INTERPRET FURTHER.

155
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.100
ONLY I SAY THINGS HAVE BEEN STRANGELY BORNE.

156
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.630
THE GRACIOUS DUNCAN WAS PITIED OF MACBETH.

157
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.330
MARRY, HE WAS DEAD.

158
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.570
AND THE RIGHT VALIANT BANQUO WALKED TOO LATE,

159
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.230
WHOM YOU MAY SAY, IF 'T PLEASE YOU,

160
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.570
FLEANCE KILLED, FOR FLEANCE FLED.

161
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.870
MEN MUST NOT WALK TOO LATE.

162
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.370
WHO CANNOT WANT THE THOUGHT,

163
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.830
HOW MONSTROUS IT WAS FOR MALCOLM AND FOR DONALBAIN

164
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.230
TO KILL THEIR GRACIOUS FATHER?

165
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.630
DAMN'D FACT.

166
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.530
HOW IT DID GRIEVE MACBETH.

167
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.230
DID HE NOT STRAIGHT IN PIOUS RAGE

168
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.600
THE TWO DELINQUENTS TEAR,

169
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.200
THAT WERE THE SLAVES OF DRINK AND THRALLS OF SLEEP?

170
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.970
WAS NOT THAT NOBLY DONE? AYE, AND WISELY TOO.

171
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.900
FOR 'TWOULD HAVE ANGERED ANY HEART ALIVE

172
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.270
TO HEAR THE MEN DENY IT.

173
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.030
SO THAT, I SAY,

174
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.330
HE HAS BORNE ALL THINGS WELL,

175
00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.600
AND I DO THINK THAT HAD HE DUNCAN'S SONS UNDER HIS KEY--

176
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.800
AND, AS PLEASE HEAVEN, HE SHALL NOT--

177
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.030
THEY SHOULD FIND WHAT 'TWERE TO KILL A FATHER;

178
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.100
SO SHOULD FLEANCE.

179
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.330
BUT PEACE, FOR FROM BROAD WORDS AND 'CAUSE

180
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.530
HE FAILED HIS PRESENCE AT THE TYRANT'S FEAST,

181
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.300
I HEAR MACDUFF LIVES IN DISGRACE.

182
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.630
SIR, CAN YOU TELL WHERE HE BESTOWS HIMSELF?

183
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:21.730
THE SON OF DUNCAN,

184
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.070
FROM WHOM THIS TYRANT HOLDS THE DUE OF BIRTH,

185
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.470
LIVES IN THE ENGLISH COURT

186
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.770
AND IS RECEIVED OF THE MOST PIOUS EDWARD WITH SUCH GRACE

187
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.670
THAT THE MALEVOLENCE OF FORTUNE

188
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.100
NOTHING TAKES FROM HIS HIGH RESPECT.

189
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.030
THITHER MACDUFF IS GONE TO PRAY THE HOLY KING,

190
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.070
UPON HIS AIDE

191
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.000
TO WAKE NORTHUMBERLAND AND WARLIKE SIWARD,

192
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.430
THAT BY THE HELP OF THESE--

193
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.000
WITH HIM ABOVE TO RATIFY THE WORK--

194
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.170
WE MAY AGAIN GIVE TO OUR TABLES MEAT,

195
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.700
SLEEP TO OUR NIGHTS,

196
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.900
FREE FROM OUR FEASTS AND BANQUETS BLOODY KNIVES,

197
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.870
DO FAITHFUL HOMAGE AND RECEIVE FREE HONORS--

198
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.900
ALL OF WHICH WE PINE FOR NOW.

199
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.530
AND THIS REPORT HATH SO EXASPERATE THEIR KING

200
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.430
THAT HE PREPARES FOR SOME ATTEMPT OF WAR.

201
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.470
SENT HE TO MACDUFF?

202
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.200
HE DID.

203
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.230
AND WITH AN ABSOLUTE "SIR, NOT I,"

204
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:17.230
THE CLOUDY MESSENGER TURNS ME HIS BACK AND HUMS,

205
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.930
AS WHO SHOULD SAY,

206
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.230
"YOU'LL RUE THE TIME THAT CLOGS ME WITH THIS ANSWER."

207
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.170
THAT MIGHT WELL ADVISE HIM TO A CAUTION,

208
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.370
TO HOLD WHAT DISTANCE HIS WISDOM CAN PROVIDE.

209
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.530
SOME HOLY ANGEL FLY TO THE COURT OF ENGLAND,

210
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.170
AND UNFOLD HIS MESSAGE ERE HE COME,

211
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.800
THAT A SWIFT BLESSING MAY SOON RETURN

212
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.200
TO THIS OUR SUFFERING COUNTRY

213
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.770
UNDER A HAND ACCURSED!

214
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.130
SAW YOU THE WEIRD SISTERS?

215
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.300
NO, MY LORD.

216
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.070
CAME THEY NOT BY YOU?

217
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.730
NO INDEED, MY LORD.

218
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:46.330
INFECTED BE THE AIR WHEREON THEY RIDE,

219
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.630
AND DAMN'D ALL THOSE THAT TRUST THEM!

220
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.330
I DID HEAR THE GALLOPING OF HORSE.

221
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.130
WHO WAS IT CAME BY?

222
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.870
'TIS TWO OR THREE, MY LORD, THAT BRING YOU WORD

223
00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.530
MACDUFF IS FLED TO ENGLAND.

224
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.070
FLED TO ENGLAND?

225
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.430
AYE, MY GOOD LORD.

226
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:14.670
TIME, THOU ANTICIPATEST MY DREAD EXPLOITS.

227
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.800
FROM THIS MOMENT, THE VERY FIRSTLINGS OF MY HEART

228
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.230
SHALL BE THE FIRSTLINGS OF MY HAND.

229
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.500
AND EVEN NOW, TO CROWN MY THOUGHTS WITH ACTS,

230
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.670
BE IT THOUGHT AND DONE.

231
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:30.670
THE CASTLE OF MACDUFF I WILL SURPRISE, SEIZE UPON FIFE,

232
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.870
GIVE TO THE EDGE OF THE SWORD HIS WIFE,

233
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.330
HIS BABES,

234
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:39.300
AND ALL UNFORTUNATE SOULS THAT TRACE HIM IN HIS LINE.

235
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.000
NO BOASTING LIKE A FOOL.

236
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.500
THIS DEED I'LL DO BEFORE THIS PURPOSE COOL.

237
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.600
WHAT HAD HE DONE, TO MAKE HIM FLY THE LAND?

238
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.000
YOU MUST HAVE PATIENCE, MADAM.

239
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
HE HAD NONE. HIS FLIGHT WAS MADNESS.

240
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.330
[baby crying]

241
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.930
WHEN OUR ACTIONS DO NOT, OUR FEARS DO MAKE US TRAITORS.

242
00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.670
YOU KNOW NOT WHETHER IT WAS HIS WISDOM OR HIS FEAR.

243
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.200
WISDOM?

244
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.500
TO LEAVE HIS WIFE,

245
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.130
TO LEAVE HIS BABES, HIS MANSION, AND HIS TITLES

246
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.570
IN A PLACE FROM WHENCE HIMSELF DOES FLY?

247
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:14.630
HE LOVES US NOT; HE WANTS THE NATURAL TOUCH.

248
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:19.500
FOR THE POOR WREN, THE MOST DIMINUTIVE OF BIRDS,

249
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.570
WILL FIGHT, HER YOUNG ONES IN HER NEST,

250
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.000
AGAINST THE OWL.

251
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
ALL IS THE FEAR, AND NOTHING IS THE LOVE!

252
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.770
AS LITTLE IS THE WISDOM,

253
00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.370
WHERE THE FLIGHT SO RUNS AGAINST ALL REASON.

254
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.330
MY DEAREST COZ,

255
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.330
I PRAY YOU SCHOOL YOURSELF.

256
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.430
BUT FOR YOUR HUSBAND,

257
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.600
HE IS NOBLE, WISE, JUDICIOUS,

258
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.630
AND BEST KNOWS THE FITS OF THE SEASON.

259
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.530
I DARE NOT SPEAK MUCH FURTHER.

260
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.400
BUT CRUEL ARE THE TIMES WHEN WE ARE TRAITORS,

261
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.770
AND DO NOT KNOW OURSELVES,

262
00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.970
WHEN WE HOLD RUMOR FROM WHAT WE FEAR,

263
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.870
YET KNOW NOT WHAT WE FEAR,

264
00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.400
BUT FLOAT UPON A WILD AND VIOLENT SEA EACH WAY,

265
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.700
AND NONE.

266
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.600
I TAKE MY LEAVE OF YOU.

267
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.730
SHALL NOT BE LONG BUT I'LL BE HERE AGAIN.

268
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.730
THINGS AT THE WORST WILL CEASE,

269
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.770
OR ELSE CLIMB UPWARD TO WHAT THEY WERE BEFORE.

270
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.000
MY PRETTY COUSIN, BLESSING UPON YOU.

271
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.370
FATHER'D HE IS, AND YET HE'S FATHERLESS.

272
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:24.770
I AM SO MUCH A FOOL, SHOULD I STAY LONGER,

273
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.530
IT WOULD BE MY DISGRACE AND YOUR DISCOMFORT.

274
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.030
I TAKE MY LEAVE AT ONCE.

275
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.500
SIRRAH, YOUR FATHER IS DEAD.

276
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.800
AND WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW? HOW WILL YOU LIVE?

277
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.800
AS THE BIRDS DO, MOTHER.

278
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.130
WHAT, WITH WORMS AND FLIES?

279
00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:59.030
WITH WHAT I GET, I MEAN, AND SO DO THEY.

280
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.830
POOR BIRD,

281
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.870
THOU'DST NEVER FEAR THE NET NOR LIME,

282
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.030
THE PITFALL NOR THE GIN.

283
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:07.400
WHY SHOULD I, MOTHER?

284
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.470
POOR BIRDS, THEY ARE NOT SET FOR.

285
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.000
MY FATHER IS NOT DEAD, FOR ALL YOUR SAYING.

286
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.870
YES, HE IS DEAD.

287
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.130
HOW WILT THOU DO FOR A FATHER?

288
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.800
NAY, HOW WILL YOU DO FOR A HUSBAND?

289
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.870
WHY, I CAN BUY ME 20 AT ANY MARKET.

290
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.970
THEN YOU'LL BUY 'EM TO SELL AGAIN.

291
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.800
THOU SPEAK'ST WITH ALL THY WIT,

292
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.730
AND YET, IN FAITH...

293
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.630
'TIS WIT ENOUGH FOR THEE.

294
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:41.870
WAS MY FATHER A TRAITOR, MOTHER?

295
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.830
AYE, THAT HE WAS.

296
00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.570
WHAT IS A TRAITOR?

297
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.600
WHY, ONE THAT SWEARS AND LIES.

298
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.930
AND BE ALL TRAITORS THAT DO SO?

299
00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.030
EVERY ONE THAT DOES SO IS A TRAITOR,

300
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.830
AND MUST BE HANGED.

301
00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.900
AND MUST THEY ALL BE HANGED THAT SWEAR AND LIE?

302
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.500
EVERY ONE.

303
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.770
WHO MUST HANG THEM?

304
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.030
WHY, THE HONEST MEN.

305
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.170
THEN THE LIARS AND SWEARERS ARE FOOLS,

306
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.370
FOR THERE ARE LIARS AND SWEARERS ENOW

307
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.000
TO BEAT THE HONEST MEN AND HANG UP THEM.

308
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.970
[laughs]

309
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:21.770
NOW GOD HELP THEE, POOR MONKEY.

310
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.030
BUT HOW WILT THOU DO FOR A FATHER?

311
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.430
IF HE WERE DEAD, YOU'D WEEP FOR HIM.

312
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.000
IF YOU WOULD NOT, IT WERE A GOOD SIGN

313
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.270
THAT I SHOULD QUICKLY HAVE A NEW FATHER.

314
00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:37.370
POOR PRATTLER, HOW THOU TALK'ST!

315
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.470
[footsteps approaching]

316
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.400
BLESS YOU, FAIR DAME.

317
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.500
I AM NOT TO YOU KNOWN,

318
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.430
THOUGH IN YOUR STATE OF HONOR I AM PERFECT.

319
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.770
I DOUBT SOME DANGER DOES APPROACH YOU NEARLY.

320
00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.700
IF YOU WILL TAKE A HOMELY MAN'S ADVICE,

321
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.000
BE NOT FOUND HERE.

322
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.170
WELL, HENCE WITH YOUR LITTLE ONES!

323
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:59.270
TO FRIGHT YOU THUS, METHINKS I AM TOO SAVAGE.

324
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.470
TO DO WORSE TO YOU WERE FELL CRUELTY,

325
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:02.830
WHICH IS TOO NIGH YOUR PERSON.

326
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.770
WELL, HEAVEN PRESERVE YOU!

327
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.930
I DARE ABIDE NO LONGER.

328
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.200
WHITHER SHOULD I FLY?

329
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.770
I HAVE DONE NO HARM.

330
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:22.100
BUT I REMEMBER NOW I AM IN THIS EARTHLY WORLD--

331
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.230
WHERE TO DO HARM IS OFTEN LAUDABLE,

332
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:30.130
TO DO GOOD SOMETIME ACCOUNTED DANGEROUS FOLLY.

333
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:34.230
WHY, THEN, ALAS, DO I PUT UP THAT WOMANLY DEFENSE,

334
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.200
TO SAY I HAVE DONE NO HARM?

335
00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:09.330


336
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.000
WHAT ARE THESE FACES?

337
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.230
WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND?

338
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:17.100
I HOPE IN NO PLACE SO UNSANCTIFIED

339
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.500
WHERE SUCH AS THOU MAYST FIND HIM.

340
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.500
HE'S A TRAITOR.

341
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.670
THOU LIEST, THOU SHAG-EAR'D VILLAIN!

342
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.130
WHAT, YOU EGG?

343
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.130
[yelling]

344
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:28.970
[yelling

345
00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:46.670


346
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:47.670
[boy screaming]

347
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.100
YOUNG FRY OF TREACHERY.

348
00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.100
[muffled sobbing]

349
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:05.430
[Lady Macduff screaming]

350
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:25.500


351
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.330
LET US SEEK OUT SOME DESOLATE SHADE,

352
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.270
AND THERE WEEP OUR SAD BOSOMS EMPTY.

353
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:34.270
LET US RATHER HOLD FAST THE MORTAL SWORD,

354
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:39.400
AND LIKE GOOD MEN BESTRIDE OUR DOWNFALL'N BIRTHDOM.

355
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.330
EACH NEW MORN

356
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:46.170
NEW WIDOWS HOWL, NEW ORPHANS CRY,

357
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.000
NEW SORROWS STRIKE HEAVEN ON THE FACE,

358
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.200
THAT IT RESOUNDS AS IF IT FELT WITH SCOTLAND

359
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.870
AND YELLED OUT LIKE SYLLABLE OF DOLOR.

360
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.270
WHAT I BELIEVE, I'LL WAIL;

361
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.930
WHAT KNOW, BELIEVE.

362
00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.470
AND WHAT I CAN REDRESS,

363
00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.500
AS I SHALL FIND THE TIME TO FRIEND, I WILL.

364
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.100
WHAT YOU HAVE SPOKE, IT MAY BE SO PERCHANCE.

365
00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.030
THIS TYRANT, WHOSE SOLE NAME BLISTERS OUR TONGUES,

366
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.600
WAS ONCE THOUGHT HONEST.

367
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.700
YOU HAVE LOVED HIM WELL.

368
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.930
HE HATH NOT TOUCHED YOU YET.

369
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.930
I AM YOUNG,

370
00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.130
BUT SOMETHING YOU MAY DESERVE OF HIM THROUGH ME,

371
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.600
AND WISDOM TO OFFER UP A WEAK, POOR, INNOCENT LAMB

372
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.370
TO APPEASE AN ANGRY GOD.

373
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.700
I AM NOT TREACHEROUS.

374
00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.130
BUT MACBETH IS!

375
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.970
A GOOD AND VIRTUOUS NATURE MAY RECOIL AT AN IMPERIAL CHARGE.

376
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.200
BUT I SHALL CRAVE YOUR PARDON.

377
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.030
THAT WHICH YOU ARE, MY THOUGHTS CANNOT TRANSPOSE.

378
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.700
ANGELS ARE BRIGHT STILL, THOUGH THE BRIGHTEST FELL.

379
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.700
THOUGH ALL THINGS FOUL WOULD WEAR THE BROWS OF GRACE,

380
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.070
YET GRACE MUST STILL LOOK SO.

381
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.400
I HAVE LOST MY HOPES.

382
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.600
PERCHANCE EVEN THERE WHERE I DID FIND MY DOUBTS.

383
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.800
WHY IN THAT RAWNESS LEFT YOU WIFE AND CHILD,

384
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.570
THOSE PRECIOUS MOTIVES,

385
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.030
THOSE STRONG KNOTS OF LOVE, WITHOUT LEAVE-TAKING?

386
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.030
I PRAY YOU,

387
00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.970
LET NOT MY JEALOUSIES BE YOUR DISHONORS,

388
00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.370
BUT MINE OWN SAFETIES.

389
00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:00.570
YOU MAY BE RIGHTLY JUST, WHATEVER I SHALL THINK.

390
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:08.500
BLEED, BLEED, POOR COUNTRY.

391
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.570
GREAT TYRANNY, LAY THOU THY BASIS SURE,

392
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.170
FOR GOODNESS DARE NOT CHECK THEE.

393
00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:15.800
WEAR THOU THY WRONGS,

394
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:21.170
THE TITLE... IS AFEARED.

395
00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.700
FARE THEE WELL, LORD.

396
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.900
I WOULD NOT BE THE VILLAIN THAT THOU THINK'ST

397
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.130
FOR THE WHOLE SPACE THAT'S IN THE TYRANT'S GRASP

398
00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.730
AND THE RICH EAST TO BOOT.

399
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.130
BE NOT OFFENDED.

400
00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.470
I SPEAK NOT AS IN ABSOLUTE FEAR OF YOU.

401
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.270
I THINK OUR COUNTRY SINKS BENEATH THE YOKE.

402
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.800
IT WEEPS.  IT BLEEDS.

403
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.770
AND EACH NEW DAY A GASH IS ADDED TO HER WOUNDS.

404
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.000
I THINK WITHAL

405
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.330
THERE WOULD BE HANDS UPLIFTED IN MY RIGHT.

406
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:45.700
AND HERE FROM GRACIOUS ENGLAND

407
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.330
HAVE I OFFER OF GOODLY THOUSANDS.

408
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:50.470
BUT, FOR ALL THIS,

409
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.800
WHEN I SHALL TREAD UPON THE TYRANT'S HEAD,

410
00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.130
OR WEAR IT ON MY SWORD,

411
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.200
YET MY POOR COUNTRY SHALL HAVE MORE VICES

412
00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.300
THAN IT HAD BEFORE.

413
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.530
MORE SUFFER,

414
00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.670
AND MORE SUNDRY WAYS THAN EVER,

415
00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:04.730
BY HIM THAT SHALL SUCCEED.

416
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.370
WHAT SHOULD HE BE?

417
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.130
IT IS MYSELF I MEAN,

418
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:10.970
IN WHOM I KNOW ALL THE PARTICULARS OF VICE

419
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.100
SO GRAFTED THAT WHEN THEY SHALL BE OPENED,

420
00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:17.400
BLACK MACBETH WILL SEEM AS PURE AS SNOW,

421
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.500
AND THE POOR STATE ESTEEM HIM AS A LAMB,

422
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.130
BEING COMPARED WITH MY CONFINELESS HARMS.

423
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.170
NOT IN THE LEGIONS OF HORRID HELL

424
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:30.330
CAN COME A DEVIL MORE DAMN'D IN EVILS TO TOP MACBETH.

425
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.400
I GRANT HIM BLOODY, LUXURIOUS, AVARICIOUS,

426
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.430
FALSE, DECEITFUL, SUDDEN, MALICIOUS,

427
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.700
SMACKING OF EVERY SIN THAT HAS A NAME.

428
00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:42.730
BUT THERE'S NO BOTTOM, NONE, IN MY VOLUPTUOUSNESS.

429
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.630
YOUR WIVES, YOUR DAUGHTERS, YOUR MATRONS, AND YOUR MAIDS

430
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.170
COULD NOT FILL UP THE CISTERN OF MY LUST,

431
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.970
AND MY DESIRE ALL CONTINENT IMPEDIMENTS

432
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.700
WOULD O'ERBEAR THAT DID OPPOSE MY WILL.

433
00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.400
BETTER MACBETH THAN SUCH AN ONE TO REIGN.

434
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:10.930
BOUNDLESS INTEMPERANCE IN NATURE IS A TYRANNY.

435
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.430
IT HATH BEEN TH' UNTIMELY EMPTYING OF THE HAPPY THRONE,

436
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.270
AND FALL OF MANY KINGS.

437
00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.070
BUT FEAR NOT YET

438
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.170
TO TAKE UPON YOU WHAT IS YOURS.

439
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:30.130
YOU MAY CONVEY YOUR PLEASURES IN A SPACIOUS PLENTY,

440
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:34.100
AND YET SEEM COLD, THE TIME YOU MAY SO HOODWINK.

441
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.230
WE HAVE WILLING DAMES ENOUGH.

442
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:41.470
THERE CANNOT BE THAT VULTURE IN YOU TO DEVOUR SO MANY

443
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.170
AS WILL TO GREATNESS DEDICATE THEMSELVES,

444
00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.070
FINDING IT SO INCLINED.

445
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:47.370
WITH THIS,

446
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:49.700
THERE GROWS IN MY MOST ILL-COMPOSED AFFECTIONS

447
00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.730
SUCH A STAUNCHLESS AVARICE THAT, WERE I KING,

448
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.970
I SHOULD CUT OFF THE NOBLES FOR THEIR LANDS,

449
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.630
DESIRE HIS JEWELS, THIS OTHER'S HOUSE,

450
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.930
AND MY MORE-HAVING WOULD BE AS A SAUCE

451
00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.300
TO MAKE ME HUNGER MORE,

452
00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.000
THAT I SHOULD FORGE QUARRELS UNJUST

453
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.570
AGAINST THE GOOD AND LOYAL, DESTROYING THEM FOR WEALTH.

454
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:17.530
THIS AVARICE STICKS DEEPER,

455
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:22.870
GROWS WITH MORE PERNICIOUS ROOT THAN SUMMER-SEEMING LUST,

456
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:27.270
AND IT HATH BEEN THE SWORD OF OUR SLAIN KINGS.

457
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.730
YET DO NOT FEAR.

458
00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.000
SCOTLAND HATH FOISONS TO FILL UP YOUR WILL

459
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.300
OF YOUR MERE OWN.

460
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.770
ALL THESE ARE PORTABLE, WITH OTHER GRACES WEIGHED.

461
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.370
BUT I HAVE NONE.

462
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:42.330
THE KING-BECOMING GRACES-- AS JUSTICE, VERITY,

463
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:45.400
TEMP'RANCE, STABLENESS, BOUNTY, PERSEVERANCE,

464
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.530
MERCY, LOWLINESS, DEVOTION, PATIENCE, COURAGE, FORTITUDE--

465
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:50.930
I HAVE NO RELISH OF THEM,

466
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.130
BUT ABOUND IN THE DIVISION OF EACH SEVERAL CRIME,

467
00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:55.900
ACTING IT MANY WAYS.

468
00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.170
NAY, HAD I POWER,

469
00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:01.330
I SHOULD POUR THE SWEET MILK OF CONCORD INTO HELL,

470
00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:05.830
UPROAR THE UNIVERSAL PEACE, CONFOUND ALL UNITY ON EARTH.

471
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.630
OH, SCOTLAND, SCOTLAND.

472
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:09.570
IF SUCH A ONE BE FIT TO GOVERN, SPEAK.

473
00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.870
I AM AS I HAVE SPOKEN.

474
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:16.730
FIT TO GOVERN? NO, NOT TO LIVE!

475
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.730
O NATION MISERABLE!

476
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:23.400
WITH AN UNTITLED TYRANT BLOODY-SCEPTRED,

477
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.230
WHEN SHALT THOU SEE THY WHOLESOME DAYS AGAIN,

478
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.300
SINCE THAT THE TRUEST ISSUE OF THY THRONE

479
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.870
BY HIS OWN INTERDICTION STANDS ACCUSED,

480
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:33.930
AND DOES BLASPHEME HIS BREED?

481
00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:37.930
THY ROYAL FATHER WAS A MOST SAINTED KING.

482
00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:39.300
THE QUEEN THAT BORE THEE,

483
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.400
OFTENER UPON HER KNEES THAN ON HER FEET,

484
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.130
DIED EVERY DAY SHE LIVED.

485
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:46.970
FARE THEE WELL.

486
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.170
THESE EVILS THAT THOU REPEAT'ST UPON THYSELF

487
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.300
HATH BANISHED ME FROM SCOTLAND!

488
00:24:52.300 --> 00:25:00.500
OH, MY BREAST, THY HOPE ENDS HERE.

489
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:05.800
MACDUFF, THIS NOBLE PASSION,

490
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.070
CHILD OF INTEGRITY,

491
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.030
HATH FROM MY SOUL WIPED THE BLACK SCRUPLES,

492
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:12.630
RECONCILED MY THOUGHTS TO THY GOOD TRUTH AND HONOR.

493
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.170
DEVILISH MACBETH BY MANY OF THESE TRAINS

494
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:16.830
HAS SOUGHT TO WIN ME INTO HIS POWER,

495
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:19.770
AND MODEST WISDOM PLUCKS ME FROM OVERCREDULOUS HASTE.

496
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.300
BUT GOD ABOVE DEAL BETWEEN THEE AND ME.

497
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.570
FOR EVEN NOW I PUT MYSELF TO THY DIRECTION,

498
00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:27.470
AND UNSPEAK MINE OWN DETRACTION,

499
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.670
HERE ABJURE THE TAINTS AND BLAMES I LAID UPON MYSELF,

500
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.430
FOR STRANGERS TO MY NATURE.

501
00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:38.000
I AM YET UNKNOWN TO WOMAN,

502
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.200
NEVER WAS FORSWORN,

503
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.470
SCARCELY HAVE COVETED WHAT WAS MINE OWN,

504
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.400
AT NO TIME BROKE MY FAITH,

505
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.430
WOULD NOT BETRAY THE DEVIL TO HIS FELLOW,

506
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:49.200
AND DELIGHT NO LESS IN TRUTH THAN LIFE.

507
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.700
MY FIRST FALSE SPEAKING WAS THIS UPON MYSELF.

508
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:57.730
WHAT I AM TRULY IS THINE AND MY POOR COUNTRY'S TO COMMAND,

509
00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.670
WHITHER INDEED, BEFORE THY HERE-APPROACH,

510
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:01.200
GOOD SIWARD,

511
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.130
AND 10,000 WARLIKE MEN ALREADY AT A POINT,

512
00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.370
WERE SETTING FORTH.

513
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.130
NOW WE'LL TOGETHER,

514
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.070
AND THE CHANCE OF GOODNESS BE LIKE OUR WARRANTED QUARREL.

515
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.530
WHY ARE YOU SILENT?

516
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:21.630
SUCH WELCOME AND UNWELCOME THINGS AT ONCE...

517
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.530
'TIS HARD TO RECONCILE.

518
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.830
SEE WHO COMES HERE!

519
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.770
MY COUNTRYMAN, BUT YET I KNOW HIM NOT.

520
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:35.730
MY EVER GENTLE COUSIN, WELCOME HITHER.

521
00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:37.330
I KNOW HIM NOW.

522
00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.930
GOOD GOD BETIMES REMOVE THE MEANS

523
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.500
THAT MAKE US STRANGERS.

524
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.470
SIR, AMEN.

525
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.170
STANDS SCOTLAND WHERE IT DID?

526
00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:48.130
ALAS, POOR COUNTRY, ALMOST AFRAID TO KNOW ITSELF.

527
00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:51.830
IT CANNOT BE CALLED OUR MOTHER, BUT OUR GRAVE,

528
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.770
WHERE NOTHING BUT WHO KNOWS NOTHING

529
00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:55.530
IS ONCE SEEN TO SMILE;

530
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:59.200
WHERE SIGHS, AND GROANS AND SHRIEKS THAT RENT THE AIR

531
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.670
ARE MADE, NOT MARKED;

532
00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:05.070
WHERE VIOLENT SORROW SEEMS A MODERN ECSTASY.

533
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:08.230
THE DEAD MAN'S KNELL IS THERE SCARCE ASK'D FOR WHO,

534
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.730
AND GOOD MEN'S LIVES EXPIRE

535
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.700
BEFORE THE FLOWERS IN THEIR CAPS,

536
00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.970
DYING OR ERE THEY SICKEN.

537
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.900
OH, RELATION.

538
00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.730
TOO NICE, AND YET TOO TRUE.

539
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.400
WHAT'S THE NEWEST GRIEF?

540
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.730
THAT OF AN HOUR'S AGE DOTH HISS THE SPEAKER.

541
00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.170
EACH MINUTE TEEMS A NEW ONE.

542
00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:27.170
HOW DOES MY WIFE?

543
00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:28.170
WELL.

544
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:29.270
AND ALL MY CHILDREN?

545
00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.470
WELL TOO.

546
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.630
THE TYRANT HAS NOT BATTERED AT THEIR PEACE?

547
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.830
NO, THEY WERE WELL AT PEACE WHEN I DID LEAVE 'EM,

548
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.470
BE NOT A NIGGARD OF YOUR SPEECH.

549
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.530
HOW GOES 'T?

550
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.530
WHEN I CAME HITHER TO TRANSPORT THE TIDINGS,

551
00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:44.170
WHICH I HAVE HEAVILY BORNE, THERE RAN A RUMOR

552
00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.030
OF MANY WORTHY FELLOWS THAT WERE OUT,

553
00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.270
WHICH WAS TO MY BELIEF WITNESSED THE RATHER,

554
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:51.370
FOR THAT I SAW THE TYRANT'S POWER AFOOT.

555
00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.830
NOW IS THE TIME OF HELP.

556
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.500
YOUR EYE IN SCOTLAND WOULD CREATE SOLDIERS,

557
00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.430
MAKE OUR WOMEN FIGHT TO DOFF THEIR DIRE DISTRESSES.

558
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:02.370
BE 'T THEIR COMFORT WE ARE COMING THITHER.

559
00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:03.370
GRACIOUS ENGLAND

560
00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:05.300
HATH LENT US GOOD SIWARD AND 10,000 MEN,

561
00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.070
AN OLDER AND A BETTER SOLDIER NONE

562
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:08.470
THAT CHRISTENDOM GIVES OUT.

563
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:14.530
WOULD I COULD ANSWER THIS COMFORT WITH THE LIKE.

564
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:21.200
BUT I HAVE WORDS

565
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.470
THAT WOULD BE HOWLED OUT IN THE DESERT AIR,

566
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.630
WHERE HEARING SHOULD NOT LATCH THEM.

567
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:30.700
WHAT CONCERN THEY?

568
00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.170
THE GENERAL CAUSE?

569
00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:34.400
OR IS IT A FEE-GRIEF DUE TO SOME SINGLE BREAST?

570
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.230
NO MIND THAT'S HONEST BUT IN IT SHARES SOME WOE,

571
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:41.330
THOUGH THE MAIN PART PERTAINS TO YOU ALONE.

572
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.870
IF IT BE MINE, KEEP IT NOT FROM ME.

573
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:46.600
QUICKLY LET ME HAVE IT.

574
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.170
LET NOT YOUR EARS DESPISE MY TONGUE FOREVER,

575
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.570
THAT SHALL POSSESS THEM

576
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:52.770
WITH THE HEAVIEST SOUND THAT EVER YET THEY HEARD.

577
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.870
HMM. I GUESS AT IT.

578
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:57.730
YOUR CASTLE IS SURPRISED,

579
00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:00.870
YOUR WIFE AND BABES SAVAGELY SLAUGHTERED.

580
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:02.800
TO RELATE THE MANNER, WERE ON THE QUARRY

581
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.300
OF THESE MURDERED DEER TO ADD THE DEATH OF YOU.

582
00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.830
MERCIFUL HEAVEN!

583
00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:10.230
WHAT, MAN,

584
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:12.170
NE'ER PULL YOUR HAT UPON YOUR BROWS.

585
00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:13.170
GIVE SORROW WORDS.

586
00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:16.130
THE GRIEF THAT DOES NOT SPEAK

587
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:19.230
WHISPERS THE O'ER-FRAUGHT HEART AND BIDS IT BREAK.

588
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:24.700
[whispering] My children too?

589
00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.200
WIFE, CHILDREN, SERVANTS,

590
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.630
ALL THAT COULD BE FOUND.

591
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:32.600
AND I MUST BE FROM THENCE.

592
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:38.070
MY WIFE...

593
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:41.730
KILLED TOO?

594
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:43.570
I HAVE SAID.

595
00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:44.700
BE COMFORTED.

596
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.900
LET'S MAKE US MEDICINES OF OUR GREAT REVENGE

597
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.530
TO CURE THIS DEADLY GRIEF.

598
00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:51.270
HE HAS NO CHILDREN!

599
00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:58.130
All...

600
00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:01.770
my pretty ones?

601
00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:04.770
Did you say...

602
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.170
all?

603
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:12.770
O hell-kite!

604
00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:15.200
All?

605
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.900
What?

606
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:25.070
All my pretty chickens, and their dam,

607
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:26.970
at one fell swoop?

608
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:28.530
DISPUTE IT LIKE A MAN.

609
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:37.500
I SHALL DO SO.

610
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.830
BUT I MUST ALSO...

611
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:44.570
FEEL IT...

612
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:50.130
AS A MAN.

613
00:30:50.130 --> 00:31:00.970
I CANNOT BUT REMEMBER SUCH THINGS WERE,

614
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:06.930
THAT WERE MOST PRECIOUS TO ME.

615
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:11.630
DID HEAVEN LOOK ON,

616
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:14.770
AND WOULD NOT TAKE THEIR PART?

617
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:23.070
SINFUL MACDUFF!

618
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:28.500
They were all struck for thee.

619
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.700
NAUGHT THAT I AM, NOT FOR THEIR OWN DEMERITS,

620
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:36.530
BUT FOR MINE, FELL SLAUGHTER ON THEIR SOULS!

621
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:45.800
HEAVEN, REST THEM NOW.

622
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.570
BE THIS THE WHETSTONE OF YOUR SWORD.

623
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:51.070
LET GRIEF CONVERT TO ANGER.

624
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:52.870
BLUNT NOT THE HEART; ENRAGE IT.

625
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:54.930
I COULD PLAY THE WOMAN WITH MINE EYES

626
00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.600
AND BRAGGART WITH MY TONGUE!

627
00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.430
BUT GENTLE HEAVENS!

628
00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:09.970
CUT SHORT ALL INTERMISSION.

629
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:14.470
FRONT TO FRONT, BRING THOU THIS FIEND OF SCOTLAND AND MYSELF!

630
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.870
WITHIN MY SWORD'S LENGTH SET HIM.

631
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:21.430
IF HE 'SCAPE,

632
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:25.130
HEAVEN...

633
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:27.430
FORGIVE HIM TOO!

634
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:30.330
THIS TUNE GOES MANLY.

635
00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:32.030
COME.

636
00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.170
GO WE TO THE KING.

637
00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:34.370
OUR POWER IS READY;

638
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:36.030
OUR LACK IS NOTHING BUT OUR LEAVE.

639
00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.730
MACBETH IS RIGHT FOR SHAKING,

640
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:39.930
AND THE POWERS ABOVE PUT ON THEIR INSTRUMENTS.

641
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.600
RECEIVE WHAT CHEER YOU MAY,

642
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:52.100
THE NIGHT IS LONG THAT NEVER FINDS THE DAY.

643
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.100
