00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:54.570


2
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.970
Hey! Hey!

3
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.900
Hey! Hey!

4
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.700
Hey! Hey!

5
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.430
Now is the winter of ourdiscontent

6
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.630
made glorious summer bythis son of York.

7
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.200
And all the clouds thatlowered upon our house

8
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.730
in the deep bosom of theocean buried.

9
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.930
Now are our brows boundwith victorious wreaths,

10
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.900
our bruised arms hung upfor monuments,

11
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.300
our stern alarums changedto merry meetings,

12
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.200
our dreadful marches todelightful measures.

13
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.870
Grim-visaged war hathsmoothed his wrinkledfront,

14
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.370
and now, instead ofmounting barbed steeds

15
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.900
to fright the souls offearful adversaries,

16
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.170
he capers nimbly in alady's chamber

17
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.170
to the lascivious pleasingof a lute.

18
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.670
But I, that am not shapedfor sportive tricks

19
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.670
nor made to court anamorous looking glass;

20
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.830
I, that am rudely stamped

21
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.030
and want love's majesty tostrut before a wantonambling nymph;

22
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.170
I, that am curtailed ofthis fair proportion,

23
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.030
cheated of feature bydissembling nature,

24
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.870
deformed, unfinished,

25
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.770
sent before my time intothis breathing world

26
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.470
scarce half made up,

27
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.030
and that so lamely andunfashionable

28
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.230
that dogs bark at me as Ihalt by them--

29
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.330
why I, in this weak pipingtime of peace

30
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.300
have no delight to passaway the time,

31
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.900
unless to spy my shadow inthe sun

32
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.400
and descant on my owndeformity.

33
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.900
And therefore, since Icannot prove a lover

34
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.900
to entertain these fairwell-spoken days,

35
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.200
I am determined to prove avillain

36
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.470
and hate the idlepleasures of these days.

37
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.370
Plots have I laid,inductions dangerous,

38
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.030
by drunken prophecies,libels, and dreams,

39
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.770
to set my brother Clarenceand the king in deadly hate

40
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.370
the one against the other.

41
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.770
And if King Edward be astrue and just

42
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.100
as I am subtle, false, andtreacherous,

43
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.070
this day should Clarenceclosely be mewed up

44
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.300
about a prophecy whichsays

45
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.070
that G of Edward's heirsthe murderer shall be.

46
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.230
Dive, thoughts, down to mysoul.

47
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.070
Here Clarence comes.

48
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.500
Brother, good day.

49
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.900
What means this armed guardthat waits upon your grace?

50
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.270
His majesty, tendering myperson's safety,

51
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.900
hath appointed thisconduct to convey me tothe Tower.

52
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.030
Upon what cause?

53
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.500
Because my name is George.

54
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.070
Alack, my lord, that faultis none of yours.

55
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.870
He should for that commityour godfathers.

56
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.370
Oh, belike his majestyhath some intent

57
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.830
that you shall benew-christened in the Tower.

58
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.000
What's the matter,Clarence?

59
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.100
May I know?

60
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.600
Yea, Richard, when I know,

61
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.770
for I protest, as yet I donot.

62
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.430
But as I can learn, hehearkens after propheciesand dreams

63
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.700
and from the cross-rowplucks the letter G

64
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.430
and says a wizard told him

65
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.870
that by G his issuedisinherited should be.

66
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.170
And, for my name of Georgebegins with G,

67
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.330
it follows in his thoughtthat I am he.

68
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.970
These, as I learn, andsuch like toys as these

69
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.130
have moved his highness tocommit me now.

70
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.170
Why, this it is, when menare ruled by women.

71
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.500
'Tis not the king thatsends you to the Tower.

72
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.230
My Lady Grey, his wife,Clarence;

73
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.870
'tis she that tempers himto this extremity.

74
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.130
Was it not she and thatgood man of worship,

75
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.130
Anthony Woodville, herbrother there,

76
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.370
that made him send LordHastings to the Tower,

77
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.730
from whence this presentday he is delivered?

78
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.930
We are not safe, Clarence.

79
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.170
We are not safe.

80
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.730
By heaven, I think thereis no man secure

81
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.230
but the queen's kindredand night-walking heralds

82
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.600
that trudge betwixt theking and Mistress Shore.

83
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.070
Heard ye not what anhumble suppliant

84
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.100
Lord Hastings was to herfor his delivery?

85
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.970
Humbly complaining to herdeity

86
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.230
got my lord chamberlainhis liberty.

87
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.400
I'll tell you what.

88
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.770
I think it is our way,

89
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.370
if we will keep in favorwith the king,

90
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.930
to be her men and wear herlivery.

91
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.700
The jealous o'erworn widowand herself,

92
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.630
since that our brotherdubbed them gentlewomen,

93
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.970
are mighty gossips in ourmonarchy.

94
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.230
I beseech your graces bothto pardon me.

95
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.670
His majesty hath straitlygiven in charge

96
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.000
that no man shall haveprivate conference

97
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.670
of what degree soever withhis brother.

98
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.370
Even so, and it pleaseyour worship, Brakenbury,

99
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.430
you may partake ofanything we say.

100
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.400
We speak no treason, man.

101
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.000
We say the king is wiseand virtuous

102
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.930
and his noble queen wellstruck in years, fair, andnot jealous.

103
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.700
We say that Shore's wifehath a pretty foot, acherry lip,

104
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.730
a bonny eye, a passingpleasing tongue,

105
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.970
and that the queen's kindredare made gentle-folk.

106
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.770
Now how say you, sir?

107
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.000
Can you deny all this?

108
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.630
With this, my lord, myselfhave naught to do.

109
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.000
Naught with MistressShore?

110
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.670
I tell thee, fellow,

111
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.730
he that doth naught withher, excepting one,

112
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.530
were best to do itsecretly, alone.

113
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.100
What one, my lord?

114
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.830
Her husband, knave.Wouldst thou betray me?

115
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.070
I do beseech your grace topardon me

116
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.200
and withal forbear yourconference with the noble duke.

117
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.600
We know thy charge,Brakenbury, and will obey.

118
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.270
We are the queen's objectsand must obey.

119
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.470
Brother, farewell.

120
00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.800
I will unto the king.

121
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.000
And whatsoe'er you willemploy me in,

122
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.400
were it to call KingEdward's widow sister,

123
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.070
I will perform it toenfranchise you.

124
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.100
Meantime, this deepdisgrace in brotherhood

125
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.570
touches me deeper than youcan imagine.

126
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.870
I know it pleaseth neitherof us well.

127
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.930
Well, your imprisonmentshall not be long.

128
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.100
I will deliver you or elselie for you.

129
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.470
Meantime, have patience.

130
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.230
I must, perforce.

131
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:30.700
Farewell.

132
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.830
Go; tread the path thatthou shalt ne'er return.

133
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.830
Simple, plain Clarence.

134
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.200
I do love thee so

135
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.870
that I will shortly sendthy soul to heaven,

136
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.630
if heaven will take thepresent at our hands.

137
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.630
But who comes here?

138
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.270
The new-deliveredHastings.

139
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.000
Good time of day unto mygracious lord.

140
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.700
As much unto my good lordchamberlain.

141
00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.800
Well are you welcome tothe open air.

142
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.570
How hath your lordshipbrooked imprisonment?

143
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.300
With patience, noble lord,as prisoners must.

144
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.800
But I shall live, my lord,to give them thanks

145
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.600
that were the cause of myimprisonment.

146
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.470
No doubt, no doubt, and soshall Clarence too,

147
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.100
for they that were yourenemies are his

148
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.070
and have prevailed as muchon him as you.

149
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.200
More pity that the eagleshould be mewed

150
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.630
while kites and buzzardsprey at liberty.

151
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.030
What news abroad?

152
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.730
No news so bad abroad asthis at home.

153
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.870
The king is sickly, weak,melancholy,

154
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.530
and his physicians fearhim mightily.

155
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.800
Now, by Saint John, thatnews is bad indeed.

156
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.430
O, he hath kept an evildiet long

157
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.870
and overmuch consumed hisroyal person.

158
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.970
'Tis very grievous to bethought upon.

159
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.900
Where is he, in his bed?

160
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.270
He is.

161
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.270
Go you before, and I willfollow you.

162
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.400
He cannot live, I hope,and must not die

163
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.570
till George be packed withpost-horse up to heaven.

164
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.700
I'll in, to urge hishatred more to Clarence

165
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.100
with lies well steeledwith weighty arguments.

166
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.530
And if I fail not in mydeep intent,

167
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.930
Clarence hath not anotherday to live;

168
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.630
which done, God take KingEdward to his mercy

169
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.530
and leave the world for meto bustle in,

170
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.270
for then I'll marryWarwick's youngest daughter.

171
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.800
What though I killed herhusband and her father?

172
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.300
The readiest way to makethe wench amends

173
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.770
is to become her husbandand her father,

174
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.400
the which will I,

175
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.200
not all so much for loveas for another secretclose intent,

176
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.970
by marrying her which Imust reach unto.

177
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.600
But yet I run before myhorse to market.

178
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.600
Clarence still breathes.

179
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.270
Edward still lives andreigns.

180
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.600
When they are gone, thenmust I count my gain.

181
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.200
Set down, set down yourhonorable load,

182
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.130
if honor may be shroudedin a hearse,

183
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.200
whilst I awhileobsequiously lament

184
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.770
the untimely fall ofvirtuous Lancaster.

185
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.870
Poor key-cold figure of aholy king,

186
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.230
pale ashes of the house ofLancaster,

187
00:10:54.230 --> 00:11:00.300
thou bloodless remnant ofthat royal blood.

188
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.170
Be it lawful that Iinvocate thy ghost

189
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.300
to hear the lamentationsof poor Anne,

190
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.530
wife to thy Edward, to thyslaughtered son,

191
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:17.300
stabbed by the selfsame handthat made these wounds.

192
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:23.000
Lo, in these windows thatlet forth thy life,

193
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.330
I pour the helpless balmof my poor eyes.

194
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:34.400
O, cursed be the hand thatmade these holes,

195
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.170
cursed the heart that hadthe heart to do it,

196
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:43.730
cursed the blood that letthis blood from hence.

197
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.400
More direful hap betidethat hated wretch

198
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.070
that makes us wretched bythe death of thee

199
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.400
than I can wish to adders,spiders, toads,

200
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.670
or any creeping venomedthing that lives.

201
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:02.130
If ever he have child,abortive be it,

202
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.630
prodigious, and untimelybrought to light,

203
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.700
whose ugly and unnaturalaspect

204
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.570
may fright the hopefulmother at the view,

205
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.970
and that be heir to hisunhappiness.

206
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.270
If ever he have wife,

207
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:19.270
let her be made moremiserable by the death of him

208
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.730
than I am made by my younglord and thee.

209
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.270
Come now towards Chertseywith your holy load,

210
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.100
taken from Paul's to beinterred there.

211
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:46.300
Stay, you that bear thecorse, and set it down.

212
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.800
What black magicianconjures up this fiend

213
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.870
to stop devoted charitabledeeds?

214
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.130
Villains, set down thecorse, or, by Saint Paul,

215
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.300
I'll make a corse of himthat disobeys.

216
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.730
My lord, stand back, andlet the coffin pass.

217
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.530
Unmannered dog, standthou, when I command.

218
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.130
Advance thy halberd higherthan my breast,

219
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.130
or, by Saint Paul, I'llstrike thee to my foot

220
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.600
and spurn upon thee,beggar, for thy boldness!

221
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.630
What? Do you tremble?

222
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.500
Are you all afraid?

223
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.400
Alas, I blame you not, foryou are mortal,

224
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.330
and mortal eyes cannotendure the devil.

225
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.030
Avaunt, thou dreadfulminister of hell.

226
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.300
Thou hadst but power overhis mortal body.

227
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.600
His soul thou canst nothave; therefore ,be gone.

228
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.570
Sweet saint, for charity,be not so curst.

229
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.400
Foul devil, for God's sake,hence, and trouble us not,

230
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.830
for thou hast made thehappy earth thy hell,

231
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.830
filled it with cursingcries and deep exclaims.

232
00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.370
If thou delight to viewthy heinous deeds,

233
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.230
behold this pattern of thybutcheries!

234
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:09.500
O, gentlemen, see, see!

235
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.030
Dead Henry's wounds opentheir congealed mouths

236
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.170
and bleed afresh!

237
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.730
Blush, blush, thou lump offoul deformity,

238
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.370
for 'tis thy presence thatexhales this blood

239
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.600
from cold and empty veinswhere no blood dwells.

240
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.500
Thy deed, inhuman andunnatural,

241
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.200
provokes this deluge mostunnatural.

242
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.230
O God, which this bloodmadest,

243
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.700
revenge his death!

244
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.070
O earth, which this blooddrinkest,

245
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.300
revenge his death!

246
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.800
Either heaven with lightningstrike the murderer dead,

247
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.800
or earth, gape open wideand eat him quick,

248
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.200
as thou dost swallow upthis good king's blood,

249
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.270
which his hell-governedarm hath butchered!

250
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.600
Lady, you know no rules ofcharity,

251
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.530
which renders good forbad, blessings for curses.

252
00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.330
Villain, thou knowest nolaw of God nor man.

253
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.970
No beast so fierce butknows some touch of pity.

254
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.230
But I know none andtherefore am no beast.

255
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.170
O wonderful, when devilsspeak the truth!

256
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.270
More wonderful when angelsare so angry.

257
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.530
Vouchsafe, divineperfection of a woman,

258
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.500
of these supposed crimesto give me leave

259
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.070
by circumstance but toacquit myself.

260
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.900
Vouchsafe, defusedinfection of a man,

261
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.200
of these known evils butto give me leave

262
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.000
by circumstance to accusethy cursed self!

263
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.370
Fairer than tongue canname thee.

264
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.830
Let me have some patientleisure to excuse myself.

265
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.630
Fouler than heart canthink thee.

266
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.870
Thou canst make no excusecurrent but to hang thyself!

267
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.830
By such despair, I shouldaccuse myself.

268
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.170
And by despairing shaltthou stand excused

269
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.230
for doing worthy vengeanceon thyself,

270
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.470
that didst unworthyslaughter upon others.

271
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.600
Say that I slew them not.

272
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.330
Then say they were notslain, but dead they are,

273
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.670
and, devilish slave, bythee.

274
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:51.670
I did not kill yourhusband.

275
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.930
Why, then he is alive.

276
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.630
Nay, he is dead, and slainby Edward's hand.

277
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.770
In thy foul throat, thouliest.

278
00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.770
Queen Margaret saw thymurderous falchion smokingin his blood,

279
00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.370
the which thou once didstspend against her breast,

280
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.230
but that thy brothers beataside the point.

281
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.000
I was provoked by herslanderous tongue

282
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.330
that laid their guilt uponmy guiltless shoulders.

283
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.600
Thou wast provoked by thybloody mind,

284
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.270
that never dreamt on aughtbut butcheries.

285
00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.970
Didst thou not kill thisking?

286
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.330
I grant ye, aye.

287
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.830
Dost grant me, hedgehog?

288
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.600
Then God grant me too

289
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.500
thou mayest be damned forthat wicked deed!

290
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.430
O, he was gentle, mild,and virtuous!

291
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.400
The better for the King ofHeaven, that hath him.

292
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.300
He is in heaven, wherethou shalt never come.

293
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.370
Let him thank me that holpto send him thither,

294
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.200
for he was fitter for thatplace than earth.

295
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.200
And thou unfit for anyplace but hell.

296
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.900
Yes, one place else, ifyou will hear me name it.

297
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.900
Some dungeon.

298
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.270
Your bedchamber.

299
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.600
Ill rest betide thechamber where thou liest!

300
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.200
So will it, madam, till Ilie with you.

301
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.300
I hope so.

302
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.230
I know so.

303
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.100
But, gentle Lady Anne,

304
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.900
to leave this keenencounter of our wits

305
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.470
and fall something into aslower method,

306
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.070
is not the causer of thetimeless deaths

307
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.270
of these Plantagenets,Henry and Edward,

308
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.230
as blameful as theexecutioner?

309
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.900
Thou wast the cause andmost accursed effect.

310
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.800
Your beauty was the causeof that effect,

311
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.070
your beauty that did hauntme in my sleep

312
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:16.700
to undertake the death ofall the world

313
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.770
so I might live one hourin your sweet bosom.

314
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.770
If I thought that, I tellthee, homicide,

315
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.500
these nails should rendthat beauty from mycheeks.

316
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.570
These eyes could not endurethat beauty's wreck.

317
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:28.570
You should not blemish itif I stood by.

318
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:31.900
As all the world is cheered bythe sun, so I by that.

319
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.230
It is my day, my life.

320
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.770
Black night o'ershade thyday and death thy life!

321
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.700
Curse not thyself, faircreature; thou art both.

322
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.230
I would I were to berevenged on thee.

323
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.900
It is a quarrel mostunnatural

324
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.530
to be revenged on him thatloveth thee.

325
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.270
It is a quarrel just andreasonable

326
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.030
to be revenged on him thatkilled my husband.

327
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.870
He that bereft thee, lady,of thy husband

328
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.470
did it to help thee to abetter husband.

329
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.600
His better doth notbreathe upon the earth.

330
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.530
He lives that loves theebetter than he could.

331
00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:54.130
Name him.

332
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:54.770
Plantagenet.

333
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:55.770
Why, that was he.

334
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.330
The selfsame name but oneof better nature.

335
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:57.930
Where is he?

336
00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:58.930
Here.

337
00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.770
Why dost thou spit at me?

338
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.130
Would it were mortalpoison, for thy sake.

339
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.300
Never came poison from sosweet a place.

340
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.600
Never hung poison on afouler toad.

341
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.000
Out of my sight! Thou dostinfect mine eyes.

342
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.030
Thine eyes, sweet lady,have infected mine.

343
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.700
Would they were basilisks,to strike thee dead!

344
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.600
I would they were, that Imight die at once,

345
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.800
for now they kill me witha living death.

346
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.330
Those eyes of thine frommine have drawn salt tears,

347
00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.470
shamed their aspects withstore of childish drops.

348
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.430
These eyes, which nevershed remorseful tear,

349
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.100
no, when my father Yorkand Edward wept

350
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.070
to hear the piteous moanthat Rutland made

351
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:38.600
when black-faced Cliffordshook his sword at him

352
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.200
nor when thy warlikefather, like a child,

353
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.770
told the sad story of myfather's death

354
00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.100
and twenty times madepause to sob and weep,

355
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.100
that all the standers-byhad wet their cheeks

356
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.470
like trees bedashed withrain.

357
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.970
In that sad time, my manlyeyes did scorn an humble tear,

358
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.670
and what these sorrowscould not thence exhale,

359
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:00.900
thy beauty hath,

360
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.930
and made them blind withweeping.

361
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.900
I never sued to friend norenemy.

362
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.400
My tongue could never learnsweet smoothing word.

363
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.430
But now thy beauty isproposed my fee,

364
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.330
my proud heart sues andprompts my tongue to speak.

365
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.670
Teach not thy lip suchscorn,

366
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.630
for it was made forkissing, lady,

367
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.700
not for such contempt.

368
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.730
If thy revengeful heartcannot forgive,

369
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.530
lo, here I lend thee thissharp-pointed sword,

370
00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.630
which if thou please tohide in this true breast

371
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.300
and lay the soul forththat adoreth thee,

372
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.300
I lay it naked to thedeadly stroke

373
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.770
and humbly beg the deathupon my knee.

374
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.230
Nay, do not pause, for Idid kill King Henry,

375
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.600
but 'twas thy beauty thatprovoked me.

376
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.800
Nay, now dispatch!

377
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.570
'Twas I that stabbed youngEdward,

378
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.830
but 'twas thy heavenlyface that set me on.

379
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.500
Take up the sword again,or take up me.

380
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.800
Arise, dissembler.

381
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.770
Though I wish thy death, Iwill not be thy executioner.

382
00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.230
Then bid me kill myself,and I will do it.

383
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:56.230
I have already.

384
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.330
That was in thy rage.

385
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.070
Speak it again, and evenwith the word,

386
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.230
this hand, which for thylove did kill thy love,

387
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.730
shall for thy love kill afar truer love.

388
00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.900
To both their deaths thoushalt be accessory.

389
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.070
I would I knew thy heart.

390
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.370
'Tis figured in my tongue.

391
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.870
I fear me both are false.

392
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.500
Then never was man true.

393
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.700
Well, well, put up yoursword.

394
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.030
Say, then, my peace ismade.

395
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.430
That thou shalt knowhereafter.

396
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.100
But shall I live in hope?

397
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.930
All men, I hope, live so.

398
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.930
Vouchsafe to wear thisring.

399
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.570
To take is not to give.

400
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.600
Look how my ringencompasseth thy finger.

401
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.530
Even so, thy breastencloseth my poor heart.

402
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.100
Wear both of them, forboth of them are thine.

403
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.400
And if thy poor, devotedservant

404
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.100
may but beg one favor atthy gracious hand,

405
00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.300
thou dost confirm hishappiness forever.

406
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.900
What is it?

407
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.200
That it may please youleave these sad designs

408
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.970
to him that hath mostcause to be a mourner

409
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.830
and presently repair toCrosby Place,

410
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:12.600
where, after I havesolemnly interred

411
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.170
at Chertsey Monastery thisnoble king

412
00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.330
and wet his grave with myrepentant tears,

413
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.170
I will with all expedientduty see you

414
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.630
for divers unknownreasons.

415
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.370
I beseech you, grant methis boon.

416
00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:32.000
With all my heart, andmuch it joys me too,

417
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.470
to see you are become sopenitent.

418
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.900
Tressel and Berkeley, goalong with me.

419
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.830
Bid me farewell.

420
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:44.270
'Tis more than youdeserve.

421
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.930
But since you teach me howto flatter you,

422
00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:50.100
imagine I have saidfarewell already.

423
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.770
Sirs, take up the corse.

424
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.830
Towards Chertsey, noblelord?

425
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:07.600
No, to Whitefriars; thereattend my coming.

426
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.530
Was ever woman in thishumor wooed?

427
00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.530
Was ever woman in thishumor won?

428
00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.270
I'll have her, but I willnot keep her long.

429
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:29.330
What?

430
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.970
I, that killed her husbandand his father,

431
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.930
to take her in her heart'sextremest hate,

432
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.030
curses in her mouth, tearsin her eyes,

433
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.670
the bleeding witness ofher hatred by;

434
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.700
having God, herconscience, and these barsagainst me,

435
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.700
and I, no friends to backmy suit at all

436
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.600
but the plain devil anddissembling looks,

437
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.870
and yet to win her, allthe world to nothing.

438
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.630
Hath she forgot already thatbrave prince, Edward, her lord,

439
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.670
whom I, some three monthssince,

440
00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.170
stabbed in my angry moodat Tewksbury?

441
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.000
A sweeter and a loveliergentleman,

442
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.500
framed in the prodigalityof nature,

443
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.400
young, valiant, wise, and,no doubt, right royal,

444
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.130
the spacious world cannotagain afford.

445
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.770
And will she yet debaseher eyes on me,

446
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.970
that cropped the goldenprime of this sweet prince

447
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.970
and made her widow to awoeful bed?

448
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:23.700
On me, whose all notequals Edward's moiety?

449
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.600
On me, who halts and ammisshapen thus?

450
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:31.630
My dukedom to a beggarlydenier,

451
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.830
I do mistake my person allthis while.

452
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:37.400
Upon my life, she finds,although I cannot,

453
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.670
myself to be a marvelousproper man.

454
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.170
I'll be at charges for alooking glass

455
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.670
and entertain a score ortwo of tailors

456
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.770
to study fashion to adornmy body.

457
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.970
Since I am crept in favorwith myself,

458
00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.370
I will maintain it at somelittle cost.

459
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.030
But first, I'll turn yonfellow in his grave

460
00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:02.130
and then return, lamentingto my love.

461
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.070
Shine out, fair sun, tillI have bought a glass,

462
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.330
that I might see my shadowas I pass.

463
00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.130
Have patience, sister.

464
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.330
There's no doubt

465
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.000
his majesty will soon recoverhis accustom'd health.

466
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.500
In that you brook it ill,it makes him worse.

467
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.870
Therefore, for God's sake,entertain good comfort,

468
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.900
and cheer his grace withquick and merry eyes.

469
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.000
If he were dead, whatwould betide of me?

470
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.200
No other harm but loss ofsuch a lord.

471
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.130
The loss of such a lordincludes all harms!

472
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:40.770
The heavens have blessedyou with a goodly son

473
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.770
to be your comforter whenhe is gone.

474
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.670
Ah, he is young, and hisminority is put

475
00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.370
unto the trust of RichardGloucester,

476
00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.370
a man who loves not me nornone of you.

477
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.200
Is it concluded he shallbe protector?

478
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.930
It is determined, notconcluded yet,

479
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.230
but so it must be, if theking miscarry.

480
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.330
Here come the lords ofBuckingham and Derby.

481
00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.270
Good time of day unto yourroyal grace.

482
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.400
God make your majestyjoyful as you have been.

483
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.330
The Countess Richmond,good my lord of Derby,

484
00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.230
to your good prayer wouldscarcely say amen.

485
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:14.800
Yet, Derby, notwithstandingshe's your wife

486
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.700
and loves not me, be you,good lord, assured

487
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.700
I hate not you for herproud arrogance.

488
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.800
I do beseech you, eithernot believe

489
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.270
the envious slanders ofher false accusers,

490
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.630
or, if she be accused ontrue report,

491
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.470
bear with her weakness,

492
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.370
which, I think, proceedsfrom wayward sickness

493
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.070
and no grounded malice.

494
00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:39.970
Saw you the king today, mylord of Derby?

495
00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.630
But now the duke ofBuckingham and I

496
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:43.270
are come from visiting hismajesty.

497
00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.030
What likelihood of hisamendment, lords?

498
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.230
Madam, good hope.

499
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.070
His grace speakscheerfully.

500
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.100
God grant him health.

501
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.600
Did you confer with him?

502
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.630
Aye, madam.

503
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.130
He desires to makeatonement

504
00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:55.830
between the duke ofGloucester and your brothers

505
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.900
and between them and mylord chamberlain

506
00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.930
and sent to warn them tohis royal presence.

507
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.370
Would all were well.

508
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.900
But that will never be.

509
00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.230
I fear our happiness is atthe height.

510
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:10.130
They do me wrong, and Iwill not endure it.

511
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.500
Who is it that complainsunto the king

512
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.070
that I, forsooth, am sternand love them not?

513
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.370
By holy Paul, they lovehis grace but lightly

514
00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.300
that fill his ears withsuch dissentious rumors.

515
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.230
Because I cannot flatterand look fair,

516
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:25.600
smile in men's faces,smooth, deceive, and cog,

517
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.000
duck with French nods andapish courtesy,

518
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.900
I must be held a rancorousenemy.

519
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.330
Cannot a plain man liveand think no harm,

520
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.430
but thus his simple truthmust be abused

521
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.330
with silken, sly,insinuating jacks?

522
00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.430
To who in all this presencespeaks your grace?

523
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:44.430
To thee, that hast norhonesty nor grace.

524
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:45.830
When have I injured thee?

525
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.030
When done thee wrong?

526
00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.770
Or thee? Or thee?

527
00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.530
Or any of your faction?

528
00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:51.830
A plague upon you all!

529
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.030
His royal grace,

530
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:54.930
whom God preserve betterthan you would wish,

531
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.070
cannot be quiet scarce abreathing-while

532
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.070
but you must trouble himwith lewd complaints.

533
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:01.170
Brother of Gloucester, youmistake the matter.

534
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.430
The king, on his own royaldisposition

535
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.430
and not provoked by anysuitor else,

536
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:08.030
aiming, belike, at yourinterior hatred

537
00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:09.830
that in your outwardactions shows itself

538
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:12.430
against my children,brothers, and myself,

539
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.700
makes him to send,

540
00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.530
that he may learn theground of your ill will

541
00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:17.270
and thereby to remove it.

542
00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.630
I cannot tell.

543
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.170
The world is grown so bad

544
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.630
that wrens make prey whereeagles dare not perch.

545
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.430
Since every jack became agentleman,

546
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.200
there's many agentleperson made a jack.

547
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.600
Come, come, we know yourmeaning, brother Gloucester.

548
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.200
You envy my advancementand my friends'.

549
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.700
God grant we never mayhave need of you!

550
00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.730
Meantime, God grants thatwe have need of you.

551
00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:42.170
Our brother is imprison'dby your means,

552
00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:43.630
myself disgraced,

553
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:45.400
and the nobility held incontempt,

554
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.430
while great promotions aredaily given

555
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.830
to ennoble those thatscarce some two days since

556
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.030
were worth a noble.

557
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.400
By Him that raised me tothis careful height

558
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.700
from that contented hapwhich I enjoyed,

559
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.870
I never did incense hismajesty against the dukeof Clarence

560
00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.370
but have been an earnestadvocate to plead for him.

561
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.300
My lord, you do meshameful injury

562
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.770
falsely to draw me inthese vile suspects.

563
00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.700
You may deny that you werenot the mean

564
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.900
of my Lord Hastings' lateimprisonment.

565
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:10.900
She may, my lord, for--

566
00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:11.970
She may, Lord Rivers.

567
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.430
Why, who knows not so?

568
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:15.730
She may do more, sir, thandenying that.

569
00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:18.500
She may help you to manyfair preferments

570
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.130
and then deny her aidinghand therein

571
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.070
and lay those honors onyour high desert.

572
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.170
What may she not?

573
00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:25.170
She may. Aye, marry, mayshe.

574
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.700
What, marry, may she?

575
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.200
What, marry, may she?

576
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:32.200
Marry with a king, abachelor, and a handsomestripling too.

577
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.070
I wish your grandam had aworser match.

578
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.870
My lord of Gloucester, Ihave too long borne

579
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.470
your blunt upbraidings andyour bitter scoffs.

580
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:43.770
By Heaven, I will acquainthis majesty

581
00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:46.330
of those gross taunts thatoft I have endured!

582
00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.570
I had rather be a countryservant maid

583
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.200
than a great queen withthis condition

584
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.330
to be so baited, scorned,and stormed at.

585
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:56.030
Small joy have I in beingEngland's queen!

586
00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:59.630
And lessened be thatsmall, God, I beseech Him.

587
00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.200
Thy honor, state, and seatare due to me.

588
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.200
What!

589
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.970
Threat you me with tellingof the king?

590
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:06.400
Tell him, and spare not.

591
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.730
Look, what I have said,

592
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:09.430
I will avouch in presenceof the king.

593
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:12.200
I dare adventure to besent to the Tower.

594
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.700
'Tis time to speak; mypains are quite forgot.

595
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.970
Out, devil!

596
00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:17.870
I remember them too well.

597
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.670
Thou kills't my husbandHenry in the Tower

598
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.100
and Edward, my poor son,at Tewksbury.

599
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.900
Ere you were queen, aye,or your husband king,

600
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.200
I was a packhorse in hisgreat affairs,

601
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.630
a weeder-out of his proudadversaries,

602
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:31.730
a liberal rewarder of hisfriends.

603
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.330
To royalize his blood, Ispent mine own.

604
00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:37.470
Aye, and much better bloodthan his or thine.

605
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.430
Let me put in your minds,if you forget,

606
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:42.000
what you have been erethis and what you are;

607
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.570
withal, what I have beenand what I am.

608
00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:47.970
A murderous villain, andso still thou art.

609
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.230
Poor Clarence did forsakehis father, Warwick.

610
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.830
Aye, and forswore himself,which, Jesu pardon--

611
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.230
Which God revenge.

612
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.130
To fight on Edward's partyfor the crown.

613
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.700
And for his meed, poorlord, he is mew'd up.

614
00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.470
I would to God my heartwere flint like Edward's

615
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:04.070
or Edward's soft andpitiful like mine.

616
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.430
I am too childish-foolishfor this world.

617
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:12.870
My lord of Gloucester, inthose busy days

618
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:15.500
which here you urge toprove us enemies,

619
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:19.330
we followed then our lord,our sovereign king.

620
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.270
So should we you, if youshould be our king.

621
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:22.370
If I should be?

622
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:23.800
I'd rather be a peddler.

623
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.200
Far be it from my heart,the thought thereof.

624
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.570
As little joy, my lord, asyou suppose you should enjoy

625
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:29.970
were you this country'sking,

626
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:31.600
as little joy you maysuppose in me

627
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.530
that I enjoy being thequeen thereof.

628
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:37.100
Aye, little joy enjoys thequeen thereof,

629
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.800
for I am she andaltogether joyless.

630
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.530
I can no longer hold mepatient.

631
00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:46.700
Hear me, you wranglingpirates, that fall out

632
00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.330
in sharing that that youhave pilled from me.

633
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:53.530
Which of you trembles notthat looks on me

634
00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:57.130
if not that I am queen,you bow like subjects,

635
00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:00.970
yet that by you deposed,you quake like rebels?

636
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:04.430
Ah, gentle villain, do notturn away.

637
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:07.030
Foul wrinkled witch, whatmak'st thou in my sight?

638
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.200
But repetition of whatthou hast marred.

639
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.130
That will I make before Ilet thee go.

640
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.430
Wert thou not banished onpain of death?

641
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:18.770
I was, but I do find morepain in banishment

642
00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:22.370
than death can yield mehere by my abode.

643
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:26.870
A husband and a son thouowest me.

644
00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:31.600
And thou a kingdom.

645
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.800
All of you, allegiance.

646
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.070
This sorrow that I have byright is yours,

647
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:41.730
and all the pleasures youusurp are mine.

648
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.970
The curse my noble fatherlaid on thee

649
00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:46.730
when thou didst crown hiswarlike brows with paper,

650
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:49.400
and with thy scorns drew'strivers from his eyes,

651
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.130
and then to dry themgavest the duke a clout

652
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:55.030
steeped in the faultlessblood of pretty Rutland--

653
00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:58.570
His curses then frombitterness of souldenounced against thee

654
00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:00.070
are all fallen upon thee.

655
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:03.400
And God, not we, haveplagued thy bloody deed.

656
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.930
So just is God to rightthe innocent.

657
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:08.170
O, 'twas the foulest deedto slay that babe

658
00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:10.000
and the most mercilessthat e'er was heard of!

659
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.170
Tyrants themselves weptwhen it was reported.

660
00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:14.370
No man but prophesiedrevenge for it.

661
00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.970
Northumberland, thenpresent, wept to see it.

662
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:19.230
What?

663
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.730
Were you snarling allbefore I came,

664
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.100
ready to catch each otherby the throat

665
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:29.730
and turn you all yourhatred now on me?

666
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:33.870
Did York's dread curseprevail so much with Heaven

667
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:38.100
that Henry's death, mylovely Edward's death,

668
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:42.000
their kingdom's loss, mywoeful banishment

669
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.500
should all but answer forthat peevish brat?

670
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.030
Can curses pierce theclouds and enter Heaven?

671
00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:54.070
Why, then, give way, dullclouds, to my quick curses!

672
00:32:56.170 --> 00:33:01.530
Though not by war, bysurfeit die your king,

673
00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:05.230
as ours by murder to makehim a king.

674
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.970
Edward, thy son, that nowis Prince of Wales,

675
00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:15.030
for Edward, my son, thatwas Prince of Wales,

676
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:20.230
die in his youth by likeuntimely violence.

677
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:25.770
Thyself a queen, for methat was a queen,

678
00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.700
outlive thy glory, like mywretched self.

679
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:33.700
Long mayest thou live towail thy children's death,

680
00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.130
and see another, as I seethee now,

681
00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:40.430
decked in thy rights asthou art stalled in mine.

682
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:45.230
Long die thy happy daysbefore thy death,

683
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:50.000
and after many lengthenedhours of grief,

684
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.430
die neither mother, wife,nor England's queen.

685
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:58.270
Rivers and Dorset, youwere standers by.

686
00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:02.470
And so wast thou, LordHastings,

687
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:06.770
when my son was stabbedwith bloody daggers.

688
00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.300
God, I pray him

689
00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.100
that none of you may livehis natural age

690
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.800
but by some unlookedaccident cut off!

691
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.130
Have done thy charm, thouhateful, withered hag!

692
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:18.330
And leave out thee?

693
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:22.100
Stay, dog! For thou shalthear me.

694
00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:28.530
If heaven have anygrievous plague in store

695
00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:32.070
exceeding those that I canwish upon thee,

696
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:35.370
O, let them keep it tillthy sins be ripe,

697
00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:38.800
and then hurl down theirindignation on thee,

698
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.800
the troubler of the poorworld's peace.

699
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:48.100
The worm of consciencestill begnaw thy soul.

700
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:53.670
Thy friends suspect fortraitors whilst thou lives

701
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:57.930
and take deep traitors forthy dearest friends.

702
00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:01.630
No sleep close up thatdeadly eye of thine,

703
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:05.100
unless it be whilst sometormenting dream affrightsthee

704
00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.030
with a hell of uglydevils.

705
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:15.070
O, thou elfish-marked,abortive, rooting hog!

706
00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.500
Thou that wast sealed inthy nativity

707
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.830
the slave of nature andthe son of hell!

708
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:25.800
Ah, slander of thy heavymother's womb!

709
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.370
Thou loathed issue of thyfather's loins!

710
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:32.030
Thou rag of honor! Thoudetested--

711
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.030
Margaret!

712
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.030
Richard!

713
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.030
Huh?

714
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:36.130
I call thee not.

715
00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:37.500
I cry thee mercy, then,for I did think

716
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.370
that thou hadst called meall these bitter names.

717
00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.870
Why, so I did, but lookedfor no reply.

718
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:43.730
O, let me make the periodto my curse!

719
00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.200
'Tis done by me and endsin Margaret.

720
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.730
Thus have you breathed yourcurse against yourself.

721
00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:53.930
Poor painted queen, vainflourish of my fortune.

722
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:57.400
Why strew'st thou sugar onthat bottled spider,

723
00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.900
whose deadly web ensnareththee about?

724
00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.130
Fool, fool!

725
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:04.700
Thou whet'st a knife tokill thyself.

726
00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.130
The day will come thatthou shalt wish for me

727
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:11.230
to help thee curse thispoisonous bunchbacked toad.

728
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.700
False-boding woman, endthy frantic curse,

729
00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:15.900
lest to thy harm thou moveour patience.

730
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.130
Foul shame upon you!

731
00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.500
You have all moved mine!

732
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.400
Were you well served, youwould be taught your duty.

733
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.070
To serve me well, you allshould do me duty.

734
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:29.930
Teach me to be your queenand you my subjects.

735
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:33.670
O, to serve me well, teachyourselves that duty.

736
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.530
Peace, please, for shameif not for charity.

737
00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:39.570
Urge neither charity norshame to me!

738
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:42.770
Uncharitably with me haveyou dealt,

739
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:47.530
and shamefully my hopes byyou are butchered.

740
00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:53.600
My charity is outrage;life, my shame.

741
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.200
And in that shame stilllive my sorrow's rage!

742
00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.200
Have done, have done.

743
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.530
O princely Buckingham.

744
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:06.370
I kiss thy hand in sign ofleague and amity with thee.

745
00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:09.770
Now fair befall thee andthy noble house.

746
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:12.470
Thy garments are notspotted with our blood,

747
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:14.300
nor thou within thecompass of my curse.

748
00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:15.570
Nor no one here,

749
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:17.130
for curses never pass

750
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:19.300
the lips of those thatbreathe them in the air.

751
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:26.130
I will but think that theyascend the sky

752
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:31.370
and there awake God'sgentle-sleeping peace.

753
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:35.500
O Buckingham, take heed ofyonder dog!

754
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.730
Look, when he fawns, hebites.

755
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.900
And when he bites, hisvenom tooth will rankle tothe death.

756
00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.830
Have naught to do withhim. Beware of him.

757
00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:45.330
Sin, death, and hell haveset their marks on him,

758
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.830
and all their ministers,they attend on him.

759
00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.130
What doth she say, my lordof Buckingham?

760
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:56.070
Nothing that I respect, mygracious lord.

761
00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:59.670
What?

762
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:05.170
Dost thou scorn me for mygentle counsel

763
00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:08.400
and soothe the devil thatI warn thee from?

764
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:13.000
O, remember this anotherday,

765
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.670
when he shall split thyvery heart with sorrow,

766
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:21.570
and say poor Margaret wasa prophetess.

767
00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:28.670
Live, each of you,

768
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:32.670
the subjects to his hate

769
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:36.970
and he to yours

770
00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:40.100
and all of you to God's.

771
00:38:56.530 --> 00:39:00.800
My hair doth stand on endto hear her curses.

772
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.130
And so doth mine.

773
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:05.530
I muse why she's atliberty.

774
00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:09.870
I cannot blame her.

775
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:13.570
By God's holy mother, shehath had too much wrong,

776
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:17.330
and I repent my part thereofthat I have done to her.

777
00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:19.600
I never did her any, to myknowledge.

778
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.830
Yet you have all thevantage of her wrong.

779
00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:24.270
I was too hot to dosomebody good

780
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:26.430
that is too cold inthinking of it now.

781
00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:30.730
Marry, as for Clarence, heis well repaid.

782
00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:34.070
He is franked up tofatting for his pains.

783
00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:37.230
God pardon them that arethe cause thereof.

784
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:39.800
A virtuous and aChristian-like conclusion,

785
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.200
to pray for them that havedone scathe to us.

786
00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.630
So do I ever, beingwell-advised,

787
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.570
for had I cursed now, I'dcurse myself.

788
00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:49.170
Madam, his majesty dothcall for you

789
00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.800
and for your grace andyou, my gracious lords.

790
00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.970
Catesby, I come.

791
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:54.030
Lords, will you go withme?

792
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:55.270
We wait upon your grace.

793
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:05.500
I do the wrong and firstbegin to brawl.

794
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.530
The secret mischiefs thatI set abroach,

795
00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.570
I lay unto the grievouscharge of others.

796
00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.500
Clarence, whom I, indeed,have cast in darkness,

797
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.930
I do beweep to many simplegulls--

798
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:17.430
namely, to Derby,Hastings, Buckingham--

799
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:20.300
and tell them 'tis thequeen and her allies

800
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.100
that stir the king againstthe duke my brother.

801
00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.030
Now they believe it andwithal whet me

802
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:29.500
to be revenged on Rivers,Dorset, Grey.

803
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.300
But then I sigh and with apiece of scripture,

804
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:36.100
tell them that God bids usdo good for evil,

805
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.900
and thus I clothe my nakedvillainy

806
00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.400
with odd old ends stolenforth of holy writ

807
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.130
and seem a saint when mostI play the Devil.

808
00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.000
But soft. Here come myexecutioners.

809
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:55.870
How now, my hardy, stout,resolved mates.

810
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:57.870
Are you now going todispatch this thing?

811
00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:59.730
We are, my lord, and cometo have the warrant

812
00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.600
that we may be admittedwhere he is.

813
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.900
Well thought upon; I haveit here about me.

814
00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.670
When you have done, repairto Crosby Place.

815
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:15.900
But, sirs, be sudden in theexecution, withal obdurate.

816
00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.600
Do not hear him plead,

817
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.370
for Clarence iswell-spoken

818
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:21.070
and perhaps may move yourhearts to pity

819
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:22.070
if you mark him.

820
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:23.170
Tut, tut, my lord.

821
00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:24.870
We will not stand toprate.

822
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.870
Talkers are no good doers.

823
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:33.270
Be assured we go to use ourhands, not our tongues.

824
00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:39.230
Your eyes drop millstoneswhen fools' eyes fall tears.

825
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.270
I like you, lads.

826
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.570
About your business,straight.

827
00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:46.930
Go, go; dispatch.

828
00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:48.570
We will, my noble lord.

829
00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.170
Why looks your grace soheavily today?

830
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.800
O, I have passed amiserable night...

831
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:19.900
so full of fearful dreamsand ugly sights

832
00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.800
that, as I am a Christianfaithful man,

833
00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.630
I would not spend anothersuch a night

834
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.100
though 'twere to buy aworld of happy days,

835
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.270
so full of dismal terrorwas the time.

836
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:31.000
What was your dream, mylord?

837
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.200
I pray you, tell it.

838
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:37.900
Methought that I hadbroken from the Tower

839
00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.670
and was embark'd to crossto Burgundy.

840
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:43.900
And in my company, mybrother Gloucester,

841
00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.900
who from my cabin tempted meto walk upon the hatches.

842
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:51.570
Thence we looked towardEngland

843
00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:53.670
and cited up a thousandheavy times

844
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.230
during the wars of Yorkand Lancaster

845
00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:56.770
that had befallen us.

846
00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:02.200
As we paced along upon thegiddy footing of the hatches,

847
00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.230
methought that Gloucesterstumbled

848
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:06.830
and in falling, struck me,that thought to stay him,

849
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:09.730
overboard into the tumblingbillows of the main.

850
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:15.230
"O Lord," methought, "whatpain it was to drown."

851
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:18.430
What dreadful noise ofwaters in my ears.

852
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:22.030
What sights of ugly deathwithin my eyes.

853
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:26.430
Methought I saw a thousandfearful wrecks,

854
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:30.100
ten thousand men thatfishes gnawed upon,

855
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:33.930
wedges of gold, greatanchors, heaps of pearl,

856
00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:36.500
inestimable stones,unvalued jewels,

857
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.900
all scattered in thebottom of the sea.

858
00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.700
Some lay in dead men'sskulls.

859
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.370
And in the holes whereeyes did once inhabit,

860
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:49.700
there were crept, as'twere, in scorn of eyes,

861
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:54.600
reflecting gems that wooedthe slimy bottom of the deep

862
00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.970
and mocked the dead bonesthat lay scattered by.

863
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.700
Had you such leisure inthe time of death

864
00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.730
to gaze upon these secretsof the deep?

865
00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:04.930
Methought I had,

866
00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:07.930
and often did I strive toyield the ghost,

867
00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:11.030
but still the enviousflood stopped in my soul

868
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:12.200
and would not let it forth

869
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.470
to find the empty, vast,and wandering air

870
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:16.730
but smothered it within mypanting bulk,

871
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:18.370
which almost burst tobelch it in the sea.

872
00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:20.230
Awaked you not in thissore agony?

873
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:22.770
No, no, my dream waslengthened after life.

874
00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:28.870
O, then began the tempestto my soul.

875
00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:36.030
I passed, methought, themelancholy flood

876
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:38.770
with that sour ferrymanwhich poets write of

877
00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:42.230
unto the kingdom ofperpetual night.

878
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:47.430
The first that there didgreet my stranger soul

879
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:50.000
was my great father-in-law,renowned Warwick,

880
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.100
who spake aloud, "Whatscourge for perjury

881
00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:00.200
can this dark monarchyafford false Clarence?"

882
00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.700
And so he vanished.

883
00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:08.370
Then came wandering by ashadow like an angel

884
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.170
with bright hair dabbledin blood,

885
00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:14.200
and he shrieked out aloud,

886
00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.730
"Clarence is come,

887
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:20.070
"false, fleeting, perjuredClarence,

888
00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:22.630
"that stabbed me in thefield by Tewksbury.

889
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:27.300
Seize on him, Furies. Takehim unto torment!"

890
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.430
With that, methought,

891
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:30.600
a legion of foul fiendsenvironed me

892
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.870
and howled in mine earssuch hideous cries

893
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:35.030
that with the very noise,I trembling waked,

894
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:38.500
and for a season aftercould not believe but thatI was in hell,

895
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.700
such terrible impressionmade my dream.

896
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.030
No marvel, lord, though itaffrighted you.

897
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:46.530
I am afraid, methinks, tohear you tell it.

898
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:48.900
Keeper, keeper, I havedone these things

899
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.500
that now give evidenceagainst my soul, forEdward's sake.

900
00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.900
And see how he requitesme!

901
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:58.630
O God!

902
00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:00.370
If my deep prayers cannotappease thee,

903
00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:03.230
but thou wilt be avengedon my misdeeds,

904
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:05.770
yet execute thy wrath inme alone.

905
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:11.170
O, spare my guiltless wifeand my poor children.

906
00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:27.470
Keeper, I prithee, sit byme awhile.

907
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:31.030
My soul is heavy, and Ifain would sleep.

908
00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.570
I will, my lord.

909
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.670
God give your grace goodrest.

910
00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:31.200
Sorrow breaks seasons andreposing hours,

911
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.830
makes the night morningand the noontide night.

912
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.530
Princes have but theirtitles for their glories,

913
00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:46.300
an outward honor for aninward toil.

914
00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.870
And for unfeltimaginations,

915
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:52.230
they often feel a world ofrestless cares,

916
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:59.200
so that between theirtitles and low name,

917
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.870
there's nothing differsbut the outward fame.

918
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:03.100
How?

919
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.270
Who's here?

920
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:06.730
What wouldst thou, fellow?

921
00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:07.970
How cam'st thou hither?

922
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:09.470
I would speak withClarence,

923
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:11.700
and I came hither on melegs.

924
00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.300
What?

925
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.200
So brief?

926
00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.100
'Tis better, sir, than tobe tedious.

927
00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.830
Let him see our commission,and talk no more.

928
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.830
I am in this commanded todeliver

929
00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:48.600
the noble duke of Clarenceto your hands.

930
00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.470
I will not reason what ismeant hereby

931
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.370
because I will be guiltlessfrom the meaning.

932
00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:02.470
There lies the dukeasleep.

933
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:05.700
There are the keys.

934
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:13.700
I'll to the king andsignify to him

935
00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:16.400
that thus I have resignedto you my charge.

936
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.000
You may, sir.

937
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.630
'Tis a point of wisdom.

938
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:28.370
Fare you well?

939
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:35.130
What? Shall I stab him ashe sleeps?

940
00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:37.470
No.

941
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:40.070
For he'll say 'twas donecowardly when he wakes.

942
00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:43.370
Why, he shall never wakeuntil the great judgment day.

943
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:46.270
Why, then he'll say westabbed him sleeping.

944
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:50.370
The urging of that word"judgment"

945
00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:52.500
hath bred a kind ofremorse in me.

946
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.400
What? Art thou afraid?

947
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.300
Not to kill him, having awarrant,

948
00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.930
but to be damned forkilling him,

949
00:50:57.930 --> 00:50:59.830
from the which no warrantcan defend me.

950
00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:01.500
I thought thou hadst beenresolute.

951
00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.530
So I am, to let him live.

952
00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:10.300
I'll back to the duke ofGloucester and tell him so.

953
00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:14.170
Hey, I pray thee, stay alittle.

954
00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:17.630
I hope this passionatehumor of mine will change.

955
00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:22.170
It was wont to hold me butwhile one tells twenty.

956
00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:26.230
One, two, three, four,five, six, seven, eight,nine, ten,

957
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:28.830
eleven, twelve, thirteen,fourteen, fifteen,

958
00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:31.370
sixteen, seventeen,eighteen,

959
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:34.770
nineteen, twenty.

960
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:39.570
How dost thou feel thyselfnow?

961
00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:42.700
Some certain dregs ofconscience are yet within me.

962
00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.970
Remember our reward whenthe deed's done.

963
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:48.700
Zounds, he dies!

964
00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.500
I had forgot the reward.

965
00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.370
Where is thy consciencenow?

966
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:54.530
O, in the duke ofGloucester's purse.

967
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:57.070
When he opens his purse togive us our reward,

968
00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:58.230
thy conscience flies out.

969
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:59.730
'Tis no matter. Let it go.

970
00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:03.070
There's few or none willentertain it.

971
00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:05.730
Or if it come to theeagain?

972
00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:06.970
I'll not meddle with it.

973
00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:09.430
It makes a man a coward.

974
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:12.770
A man cannot steal but itaccuseth him.

975
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:15.500
A man cannot swear but itchecks him.

976
00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.030
A man cannot lie with hisneighbor's wife

977
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:19.730
but it detects him.

978
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:22.770
'Tis a blushing,shamefaced spirit

979
00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:24.570
that mutinies in a man'sbosom.

980
00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:27.470
It fills a man full ofobstacles.

981
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:30.530
It made me once restore apurse of gold

982
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:33.100
that by chance I found.

983
00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:34.970
It beggars any man thatkeeps it.

984
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:36.630
It is turned out of townsand cities

985
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:37.930
for a dangerous thing,

986
00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:40.230
and every man that meansto live well

987
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:43.270
endeavors to trust tohimself and live without it.

988
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:45.270
'Zounds.

989
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:48.000
'Tis is even now at myelbow,

990
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.100
persuading me not to killthe duke.

991
00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:54.070
Take the devil in thymind, and believe him not.

992
00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:56.730
He would insinuate withthee but to make thee sigh.

993
00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:59.100
Tut, I am strong-framed.

994
00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.430
He cannot prevail with me.

995
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:03.870
Spoke like a tall man thatrespects our reputation.

996
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:06.530
Come, shall we fall towork?

997
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:12.770
Take him on the costardwith the hilts of thy sword

998
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:16.300
and then throw him in themalmsey-butt in the next room.

999
00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:18.300
O excellent devise!

1000
00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:19.970
And make a sop of him.

1001
00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:25.930
Hark.

1002
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:28.900
He wakes.

1003
00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:30.270
Strike now?

1004
00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:34.000
We'll reason with him.

1005
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Where art thou, keeper?

1006
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.300
Give me a cup of wine.

1007
00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:41.170
You shall have wineenough, my lord, anon.

1008
00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:42.600
In God's name, what artthou?

1009
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.270
A man, as you are.

1010
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:47.970
But not, as I am, royal.

1011
00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:50.630
Nor you, as we are, loyal.

1012
00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:57.570
Thy voice is thunder, butthy looks are humble.

1013
00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:03.070
My voice is now theking's, my looks mine own.

1014
00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:06.330
How darkly and how deadlydost thou speak.

1015
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:12.000
Your eyes do menace me.

1016
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.470
Why look you pale?

1017
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:16.300
Who sent you hither?

1018
00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.330
Wherefore do you come?

1019
00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:18.330
To--

1020
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:22.970
To--

1021
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:26.200
To murder me?

1022
00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.370
Aye. Aye.

1023
00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:30.200
You scarcely have thehearts to tell me so

1024
00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.130
and therefore cannot havethe hearts to do it.

1025
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:35.870
Wherein, my friends, haveI offended you?

1026
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:39.330
Offended us you have notbut the king.

1027
00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:41.200
I shall be reconciled tohim again.

1028
00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:44.370
Never, my lord. Therefore,prepare to die.

1029
00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:46.800
Are you drawn forth amonga world of men

1030
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.270
to slay the innocent?

1031
00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:52.300
What is my offense?

1032
00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.870
Where is the evidence thatdoth accuse me?

1033
00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:58.400
What lawful quest havegiven their verdict up

1034
00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.830
unto the frowning judge?

1035
00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:01.600
Or who pronounced thebitter sentence

1036
00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.830
of poor Clarence death?

1037
00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:07.900
Before I be convict bycourse of law,

1038
00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:11.600
to threaten me with deathis most unlawful.

1039
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.530
I charge you, as you hopeto have redemption

1040
00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:17.270
by Christ's dear blood shedfor our grievous sins,

1041
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:19.900
that you depart and lay nohands on me.

1042
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.970
The deed you undertake isdamnable.

1043
00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:24.600
What we will do, we doupon command.

1044
00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.030
And he that hath commandedis our king.

1045
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:28.700
Erroneous vassals!

1046
00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.330
The great King of kings hathin the table of his law

1047
00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:33.570
commanded that thou shaltdo no murder.

1048
00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:37.730
Will you then spurn at hisedict and fulfill a man's?

1049
00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:41.030
Take heed, for he holdsvengeance in his hand

1050
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:43.330
to hurl upon their headsthat break his law.

1051
00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:46.030
And that same vengeancedoth he hurl on thee

1052
00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:48.300
for false forswearing andfor murder too.

1053
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.700
Thou didst receive thesacrament

1054
00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.730
to fight in quarrel of thehouse of Lancaster.

1055
00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:53.600
And like a traitor to thename of God

1056
00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.700
didst break that vow

1057
00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:56.330
and with thy treacherousblade

1058
00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:58.370
unrip'dst the bowels ofthy sovereign's son.

1059
00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:00.770
Whom thou was sworn tocherish and defend.

1060
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:03.100
How can thou urge God'sdreadful law to us,

1061
00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.830
when thou hast broke it insuch dear degree?

1062
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:07.030
Alas, for whose sake did Ithat ill deed?

1063
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.730
For Edward, for mybrother, for his sake.

1064
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:10.670
He sends you not to murderme for this,

1065
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:12.830
for in that sin, he is asdeep as I.

1066
00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:15.070
If God will be avenged forthe deed,

1067
00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:17.400
O, know you yet, he doesit publicly.

1068
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.930
Take not the quarrel fromhis powerful arm.

1069
00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:22.500
He needs no indirect orlawless course

1070
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.770
to cut off those that haveoffended him.

1071
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:26.270
Who made thee, then, abloody minister

1072
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:29.100
when gallant-springingbrave Plantagenet,

1073
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:31.570
that princely novice, wasstruck dead by thee?

1074
00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:33.330
My brother's love, thedevil, and my rage.

1075
00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:35.930
Thy brother's love, ourduty, and thy fault

1076
00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:38.430
provoke us hither now toslaughter thee.

1077
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:40.700
Oh, if you love mybrother, hate not me.

1078
00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:43.400
I am his brother, and Ilove him well.

1079
00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.730
If you are hired for meed,go back again,

1080
00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:47.070
and I will send you to mybrother Gloucester,

1081
00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:48.730
who shall reward youbetter for my life

1082
00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:50.070
than Edward will fortidings of my death.

1083
00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:51.300
You are deceived.

1084
00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:52.870
Your brother Gloucesterhates you.

1085
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:55.330
O, no, he loves me, and heholds me dear.

1086
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:56.370
Go you to him from me.

1087
00:56:56.370 --> 00:56:57.370
Aye, so we will.

1088
00:56:57.370 --> 00:56:59.430
Tell him when that ourprincely father York

1089
00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:01.300
blessed his three sonswith his victorious arm

1090
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.900
and charged us from hissoul to love each other,

1091
00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:05.930
he little thought of thisdivided friendship.

1092
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:08.500
Bid Gloucester think ofthis, and he will weep.

1093
00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.700
Ah, millstones, as helessoned us to weep.

1094
00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.470
O, do not slander him, forhe is kind!

1095
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:16.800
Right, as snow in harvest.

1096
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.970
Come, you deceiveyourself.

1097
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:22.500
'Tis he that sends us todestroy you here.

1098
00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.070
It cannot be,

1099
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:25.570
for he bewept my fortune

1100
00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:27.470
and hugged me in his armsand swore with sobs

1101
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:28.830
that he would labor mydelivery.

1102
00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:30.230
Why, so he doth,

1103
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:31.970
when he delivers you fromthis earth's thralldom

1104
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:33.470
to the joys of Heaven.

1105
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:35.830
Make peace with God, foryou must die, my lord.

1106
00:57:38.370 --> 00:57:39.770
Have you that holy feelingin your souls

1107
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:42.070
to counsel me to make mypeace with God,

1108
00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:45.800
and are you yet to yourown soul so blind

1109
00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:48.330
that you will war with Godby murdering me?

1110
00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:51.970
Oh, sirs, consider.

1111
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:54.470
They that set you on to dothis deed

1112
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:56.330
will hate you for thedeed.

1113
00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:00.230
What shall we do?

1114
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.830
Relent, and save yoursouls.

1115
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.200
Relent.

1116
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.700
No, 'tis cowardly andwomanish.

1117
00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:10.800
Not to relent is beastly,savage, devilish.

1118
00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.700
Which of you, if you werea prince's son

1119
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:14.470
being pent from liberty asI am now,

1120
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:15.930
if two such murderers asyourselves came to you

1121
00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:17.270
would not entreat forlife?

1122
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:20.170
Ah, you would beg, wereyou in my distress.

1123
00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:22.900
My friend, I spy some pityin thy looks.

1124
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.100
O, if thine eye be not aflatterer,

1125
00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.900
come thou on my side andentreat for me.

1126
00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:27.900
A begging prince, whatbeggar pities not?

1127
00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:29.170
Look behind you, my lord!

1128
00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:31.800
Take that.

1129
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.530
And that.

1130
00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:39.070
And if all this will notdo,

1131
00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:41.470
I'll drown you in themalmsey-butt within.

1132
00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:59.200
A bloody deed, anddesperately dispatched.

1133
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.570
How fain, like Pilate,would I wash my hands

1134
00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:03.600
of this most grievousmurder.

1135
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:06.130
How now.

1136
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:08.070
What mean'st thou, thatthou helped me not?

1137
00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:11.330
The duke shall know howslack you have been.

1138
00:59:11.330 --> 00:59:13.330
I would he knew that I hadsaved his brother.

1139
00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:15.170
Take thou the fee, andtell him what I say,

1140
00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:17.670
for I repent me that theduke is slain!

1141
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:19.600
Go, coward, as thou art!

1142
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:23.830
Well.

1143
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.930
I'll go hide the body insome hole

1144
00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:31.300
till that the duke giveorder for his burial.

1145
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:34.970
And when I have my meed, Iwill away,

1146
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:39.730
for this will out, andthen I must not stay.

1147
01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:11.530
Amen.

1148
01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:18.730
Amen.

1149
01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:31.100
Amen.

1150
01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:18.730
Why so, now have I done agood day's work.

1151
01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:25.970
You peers, continue thisunited league.

1152
01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:28.800
I every day expect anembassage from my Redeemer

1153
01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.070
to redeem me hence,

1154
01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:32.730
and now in peace my soulshall part to Heaven,

1155
01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:39.230
since I have made myfriends at peace on Earth.

1156
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:42.800
Rivers and Hastings, takeeach other's hand.

1157
01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:48.000
Dissemble not your hatred.

1158
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.400
Swear your love.

1159
01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:54.930
By heaven, my soul ispurged from grudging hate,

1160
01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:58.170
and with my hand, I sealmy true heart's love.

1161
01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:01.600
So thrive I, as I trulyswear the like.

1162
01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.870
Take heed you dally notbefore your king,

1163
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:07.000
lest he that is thesupreme King of kings

1164
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.330
confound your hiddenfalsehood

1165
01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:12.100
and award either of you tobe the other's end.

1166
01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:17.200
So prosper I as I swearperfect love.

1167
01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:21.570
And I, as I love Hastingswith my heart.

1168

Yourself, madam, is notexempt from this.

1169
01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:32.170
Nor you, son Dorset;

1170
01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:33.500
Buckingham, nor you.

1171
01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.400
You have been factious,one against the other.

1172
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.370
Wife, love Lord Hastings.

1173
01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:38.530
Let him kiss your hand.

1174
01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:40.630
And what you do, do itunfeignedly.

1175
01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:46.500
There, Hastings.

1176
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.630

Hastings, love lordmarquess.

1180
01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.270
This interchange of love,I here protest,

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:10.270
upon my part shall beinviolable.

1182
01:03:10.270 --> 01:03:12.270
And so swear I.

1183
01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:19.930
Now princely Buckingham.

01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:27.100
and make me happy in yourunity.

1187
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:35.570
Whenever Buckingham dothturn his hate on your grace,

1188
01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:39.900
but with all duteous lovedoth cherish you and yours,

1189
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:44.300
God punish me with hate inthose where I expect mostlove.

1190
01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.270
When I have most need toemploy a friend,

1191
01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:48.600
and most assured that heis a friend,

1192
01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.970
deep, hollow, treacherous,or full of guile,

1193
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:51.270
be he unto me!

1194
01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:58.270
This do I beg of God

1195
01:03:58.270 --> 01:04:02.530
when I am cold in love toyou or yours.

1208
01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:39.300
between these swellingwrong-incensed peers.

1209
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:42.300
A blessed labor, my mostsovereign lord.

1210
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:48.530
Among this princely heap,

1211
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:51.630
if any here by falseintelligence or wrong surmise

1212
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:53.100
hold me a foe,

1213
01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:56.500
if I unwittingly or in myrage

1214
01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.770
have aught committed thatis hardly borne

1215
01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:00.400
by any in this presence,

1216
01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.430
I desire to reconcile meto his friendly peace.

1217
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:05.430
'Tis death to me to be atenmity.

1218
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:08.300
I hate it and desire allgood men's love.

1219

First, madam, I entreattrue peace of you,

1220
01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:15.870
which I will purchase withmy duteous service.

1221

Of you, my noble cousinBuckingham,

if ever any grudge werelodged between us;

that all without deserthave frowned on me;

1225
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:33.770
dukes, earls, lords,gentlemen, indeed, of all;

1226
01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:35.770
I do not know thatEnglishman alive

1227
01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:37.600
with whom my soul is anyjot at odds

1228
01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.400
more than the infant thatis born tonight.

1229
01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.530
I thank my God for myhumility.

1230
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:46.070
A holy day shall this bekept hereafter.

I would to God all strifeswere well compounded.

1232

My sovereign lord, I dobeseech your highness

1233

to take our brotherClarence to your grace.

1234

Why, madam, have I offeredlove for this,

1235
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:03.470
to be so flouted in thisroyal presence?

1236
01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:06.730
Who knows not that thegentle duke is dead?

1237
01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:09.230
You do him injury to scornhis corse.

1238
01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:15.300
Who knows not he is dead?

1239
01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:18.100
Who knows he is?

1240
01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:21.770
All-seeing Heaven, what aworld is this?

1241
01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:27.030
Look I so pale, LordDorset, as the rest?

1242
01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:28.300
Ay, my good lord.

1243
01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.570
And no man in the presence

1244
01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:31.830
but his red color hathforsook his cheeks.

1245
01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:36.470
Is Clarence dead?

1246
01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:40.470
The order was reversed!

1247
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:43.370
But he, poor man, by yourfirst order died,

1248
01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:45.700
and that a winged Mercurydid bear.

1249
01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:47.800
Some tardy cripple borethe countermand

1250
01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.430
that came too lag to seehim buried.

1251
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:53.130
God grant that some lessnoble and less loyal,

1252
01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:55.130
nearer in bloody thoughtsbut not in blood,

1253
01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:57.400
deserve not worse thanwretched Clarence did

1254
01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:58.830
and yet go current fromsuspicion.

1255
01:06:58.830 --> 01:07:00.900
A boon, my sovereign, formy service done.

1256
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:01.900
I pray thee, peace.

1257
01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:03.070
My soul is full of sorrow.

1258
01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:05.770
I will not rise unlessyour highness hear me.

1259
01:07:05.770 --> 01:07:08.830
Then say at once what isit thou demand'st.

1260
01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:11.230
The forfeit, sovereign, ofmy servant's life,

1261
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:13.200
who slew today a righteousgentleman

1262
01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.570
lately attendant on theDuke of Norfolk.

1263
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.630
Have I a tongue to doom mybrother's death,

1264
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:26.170
and shall that tongue givepardon to a slave?

1265
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.930
My brother killed no man.

1266
01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:35.100
His fault was thought,

1267
01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:37.430
yet his punishment wasbitter death.

1268
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:44.230
Who sued to me for him?

1269
01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:51.630
Who in my wrath kneeled atmy feet

1270
01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:54.170
and bade me be advised?

1271
01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.130
Who spoke of brotherhood?

1272
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:01.930
Who spoke of love?

1273
01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:08.730
Who told me how the poorsoul did forsake themighty Warwick

1274
01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:10.800
and did fight for me?

1275
01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:17.130
Who told me in the fieldat Tewksbury

1276
01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:21.830
when Oxford had me down,he rescued me and said,

1277
01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:25.300
"Dear brother, live, andbe a king"?

1278
01:08:29.530 --> 01:08:33.830
Who told me, when we bothlay in the field,

1279
01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:36.730
frozen almost to death,

1280
01:08:36.730 --> 01:08:40.000
how he did lap me even inhis garments

1281
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.730
and did give himself, allthin and naked,

1282
01:08:42.730 --> 01:08:44.670
to the numb cold night?

1283
01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:54.770
All this from myremembrance brutish wrathsinfully pluck'd,

1284
01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:59.130
and not a man of you hadso much grace to put it inmy mind!

1285
01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.900
Oh, but when your cartersor your waiting vassals

1286
01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:05.330
have done a drunkenslaughter,

1287
01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:08.870
you straight are on yourknees for pardon, pardon!

1288
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:16.170
And I, unjustly too, mustgrant it you.

1289
01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:31.770
But for my brother, not aman would speak,

1290
01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:37.030
nor I, ungracious, speak untomyself for him, poor soul.

1291
01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:41.970
The proudest of you all

1292
01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:43.670
have been beholding to himin his life,

1293
01:09:43.670 --> 01:09:47.130
yet none of you would oncebeg for his life!

1294
01:09:53.170 --> 01:09:57.670
O God, I fear thy justicewill take hold

1295
01:09:57.670 --> 01:09:59.870
on me and you and mine andyours for this!

1296
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:08.400
Come, Hastings.

1297
01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:12.670
Help me to my closet.

1298
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:16.830
Oh, poor Clarence.

1299
01:10:39.730 --> 01:10:42.000
This is the fruits ofrashness.

1300
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:48.770
Marked you not how that theguilty kindred of the queen

1301
01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:51.730
looked pale when they didhear of Clarence death?

1302
01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.730
O, they did urge it stillunto the king.

1303
01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:01.470
God will revenge it.

1304
01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:04.130
Come, lords, will you go tocomfort Edward with ourcompany?

1305
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:07.200
We wait upon your grace.

1306
01:11:34.670 --> 01:11:39.430
Good grandam, tell us, isour father dead?

1307
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:41.100
No, boy.

1308
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:43.830
Why do you weep so oft andbeat your breast

1309
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:46.270
and cry, "O Clarence, myunhappy son"?

1310
01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:48.170
Why do you look on us andshake your head

1311
01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:51.400
and call us orphans,wretches, castaways

1312
01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:53.770
if that our noble fatherwere alive?

1313
01:11:53.770 --> 01:11:56.470
My pretty cousins, youmistake me both.

1314
01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:58.230
I do lament the sicknessof the king,

1315
01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:00.970
as loath to lose him, notyour father's death.

1316
01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:05.470
It were lost sorrow towail one that's lost.

1317
01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.130
Then you conclude, mygrandam.

1318
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:13.630
He is dead.

1319
01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:15.800
The king, mine uncle, isto blame for it.

1320
01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:18.500
God will revenge it,

1321
01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.500
whom I will importune withearnest prayers

1322
01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:21.670
all to that effect.

1323
01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:22.670
And so will I!

1324
01:12:22.670 --> 01:12:24.430
Peace, children, peace.

1325
01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:26.870
The king doth love youwell.

1326
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:29.570
Incapable and shallowinnocents,

1327
01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:32.500
you cannot guess who causedyour father's death.

1328
01:12:38.970 --> 01:12:40.730
Grandam, we can,

1329
01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:43.330
for my good uncleGloucester told me

1330
01:12:43.330 --> 01:12:45.730
the king, provoked to itby the queen,

1331
01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:48.270
devised impeachments toimprison him.

1332
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:50.870
And when my uncle told meso,

1333
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:53.930
he wept and pitied me,

1334
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:56.200
kindly kissed my cheek,

1335
01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:58.930
bade me rely on him as onmy father,

1336
01:12:58.930 --> 01:13:02.030
and he would love medearly as a child.

1337
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:05.730
Oh, that deceit shouldsteal such gentle shape

1338
01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:09.500
and with a virtuous vizardhide deep vice!

1339
01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:15.130
He is my son, aye, andherein my shame,

1340
01:13:15.130 --> 01:13:18.670
yet from my dugs he drewnot this deceit.

1341
01:13:18.670 --> 01:13:21.470
Think you my uncle diddissemble, grandam?

1342
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:23.700
Aye, boy.

1343
01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:25.730
I cannot think it.

1344
01:13:25.730 --> 01:13:27.570
Hark! What noise is this?

1345
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:30.400
Oh, who shall hinder me towail and weep,

1346
01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.270
to chide my fortune andtorment myself?

1347
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:35.830
I'll join with blackdespair against my soul

1348
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:38.170
and to myself become anenemy.

1349
01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:40.930
What means this scene ofrude impatience?

1350
01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:45.200
To make an act of tragicviolence.

1351
01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:49.930
Edward, my lord, thy son,our king, is dead!

1352
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:55.330
Why grow the branches whenthe root is gone?

1353
01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:58.600
Why wither not the leavesthat want their sap?

1354
01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.330
If you will live, lament;if die, be brief,

1355
01:14:01.330 --> 01:14:04.770
that our swift-wingedsouls may catch the king's

1356
01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:06.500
or like obedient subjects,

1357
01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:10.770
follow him to his new kingdomof ne'er-changing night.

1358
01:14:10.770 --> 01:14:13.770
Ah, so much interest haveI in thy sorrow

1359
01:14:13.770 --> 01:14:16.170
as I had title in thynoble husband.

1360
01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:21.000
I have bewept a worthyhusband's death

1361
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.230
and lived with looking onhis images.

1362
01:14:24.230 --> 01:14:28.100
But now two mirrors of hisprincely semblance

1363
01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:31.470
are cracked in pieces bymalignant death,

1364
01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:35.600
and I for comfort have butone false glass

1365
01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:38.470
that grieves me when I seemy shame in him.

1366
01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.600
Thou art a widow, yet thouart a mother

1367
01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.400
and hast the comfort ofthy children left.

1368
01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:48.930
But death hath snatched myhusband from mine arms

1369
01:14:48.930 --> 01:14:53.070
and plucked two crutchesfrom my feeble hands,

1370
01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:56.970
Clarence and Edward.

1371
01:14:56.970 --> 01:14:59.400
O, what cause have I,

1372
01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.730
thine being but a moietyof my moan,

1373
01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:05.330
to overgo thy woes anddrown thy cries!

1374
01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:09.230
Ah, aunt, you wept not forour father's death.

1375
01:15:09.230 --> 01:15:11.700
How can we aid you withour kindred tears?

1376
01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:14.370
Our fatherless distresswas left unmoaned.

1377
01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:16.670
Your widow dolor likewisebe unwept!

1378
01:15:16.670 --> 01:15:18.500
Give me no help inlamentation.

1379
01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.930
I am not barren to bringforth complaints.

1380
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:24.070
All springs reduce theircurrents to mine eyes,

1381
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:26.630
that I, being governed bythe watery moon,

1382
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:30.330
may send forth plenteoustears to drown the world!

1383
01:15:30.330 --> 01:15:34.530
Oh for my husband, for mydear lord Edward!

1384
01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:37.530
Oh, for our father, forour dear lord Clarence!

1385
01:15:37.530 --> 01:15:43.030
Alas for both, both mine,Edward and Clarence.

1386
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:45.200
What stay had I butEdward?

1387
01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.700
And he's gone.

1388
01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:48.530
What stay had we butClarence?

1389
01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:49.530
And he's gone.

1390
01:15:49.530 --> 01:15:51.700
What stays had I but they?

1391
01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:52.700
And they are gone.

1392
01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:55.430
Was never widow had sodear a loss!

1393
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:58.170
Were never orphans had sodear a loss.

1394
01:15:58.170 --> 01:16:01.370
Was never mother had sodear a loss.

1395
01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:08.530
Alas, I am the mother ofthese griefs.

1396
01:16:09.970 --> 01:16:12.270
Their woes are parceled.

1397
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:14.870
Mine is general.

1398
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:23.470
She for an Edward weeps,and so do I.

1399
01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:25.700
I for a Clarence weep.

1400
01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:28.600
So doth not she.

1401
01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:33.830
These babes for Clarenceweep, and so do I.

1402
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:37.430
I for an Edward weep.

1403
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:39.500
So do not they.

1404
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:44.870
Alas, you three, on me,

1405
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:48.700
threefold distressed, pourall your tears.

1406
01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:51.400
I am your sorrow's nurse,

1407
01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:54.870
and I will pamper it withlamentation.

1408
01:17:03.170 --> 01:17:04.730
Comfort, dear mother.

1409
01:17:04.730 --> 01:17:06.630
God is much displeased

1410
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:09.930
that you take withunthankfulness his doing.

1411
01:17:11.130 --> 01:17:13.870
In common worldly things,'tis called ungrateful

1412
01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:16.170
with dull unwillingness torepay a debt

1413
01:17:16.170 --> 01:17:19.000
which with a bounteoushand was kindly lent,

1414
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.600
much more to be thusopposite with Heaven,

1415
01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:25.700
for it requires the royaldebt it lent you.

1416
01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:32.330
Madam, bethink you, like acareful mother,

1417
01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:33.800
of the young prince, yourson.

1418
01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.770
Send straight for him. Lethim be crowned.

1419
01:17:35.770 --> 01:17:38.470
In him your comfort lives.

1420
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:41.430
Drown desperate sorrow indead Edward's grave

1421
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:44.170
and plant your joys inliving Edward's throne.

1422
01:17:44.170 --> 01:17:45.730
Sister, have comfort.

1423
01:17:45.730 --> 01:17:49.070
All of us have cause towail the dimming of ourshining star,

1424
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:51.930
but none can help ourharms by wailing them.

1425
01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.670
Madam, my mother, I do cryyou mercy.

1426
01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:57.170
I did not see your grace.

1427
01:17:57.170 --> 01:17:59.300
Humbly on my knee, I craveyour blessing.

1428
01:18:01.630 --> 01:18:04.530
God bless thee and putmeekness in thy rest,

1429
01:18:04.530 --> 01:18:07.730
love, charity, obedience,and true duty.

1430
01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:09.670
Amen.

1431
01:18:09.670 --> 01:18:11.400
And make me die a good oldman.

1432
01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.000
That is the butt-end of amother's blessing.

1433
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.870
I marvel that her gracedid leave it out.

1434
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:33.530
You cloudy princes andheart-sorrowing peers

1435
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:36.830
that bear this heavymutual load of moan,

1436
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:39.570
now cheer each other ineach other's love.

1437
01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.030
Though we have spent ourharvest of this king,

1438
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:45.500
we are to reap the harvestof his son.

1439
01:18:46.770 --> 01:18:49.170
The broken rancor of yourhigh-swollen hate,

1440
01:18:49.170 --> 01:18:51.900
but lately splintered,knit, and joined together,

1441
01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:55.330
must gently be preserved,cherished, and kept.

1442
01:18:58.230 --> 01:19:00.370
Me seemeth good that withsome little train,

1443
01:19:00.370 --> 01:19:03.300
forthwith from Ludlow theyoung prince be fetch'd

1444
01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:05.830
hither to London to becrowned our king.

1445
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:09.830
Why with some little train,my lord of Buckingham?

1446
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:11.300
Marry, my lord, lest by amultitude,

1447
01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:13.370
the new-healed wound ofmalice should break out,

1448
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:15.300
which would be so much themore dangerous

1449
01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:17.370
by how much the estate isgreen and yet ungoverned,

1450
01:19:17.370 --> 01:19:19.270
where every horse bearshis commanding rein

1451
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:21.830
and may direct his courseas please himself,

1452
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:23.800
as well the fear of harm,

1453
01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:28.470
as harm apparent, in myopinion, ought to beprevented.

1454
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:32.870
I hope the king made peacewith all of us,

1455
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:36.000
and the compact is firmand true in me.

1456
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.170
And so in me.

1457
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:41.630
And so, I think, in all.

1458
01:19:41.630 --> 01:19:44.630
Yet, since it is butgreen,

1459
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:47.600
it should be put to noapparent likelihood of breach

1460
01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:50.500
which haply by muchcompany might be urged.

1461
01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:52.470
Therefore, I say withnoble Buckingham

1462
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:56.470
that it is meet so fewshould fetch the prince.

1463
01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.000
And so say I.

1464
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:04.270
Then be it so.

1465
01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:06.230
And go we to determine whothey shall be

1466
01:20:06.230 --> 01:20:08.170
that straight shall postto Ludlow.

1467
01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:10.000
Madam, and you, my sister,

1468
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.530
will you go to give yourcensures in this business?

1469
01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.630
With all our hearts.

1470
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:34.300
Now, my lord, whoeverjourneys to the prince,

1471
01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:36.000
for God's sake, let not ustwo stay at home,

1472
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.370
for by the way, I'll sortoccasion

1473
01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:39.770
as index to the story welate talked of,

1474
01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:44.000
to part the queen's proudkindred from the prince.

1475
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.470
My other self, mycounsel's consistory,

1476
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:52.370
my oracle, my prophet.

1477
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:56.600
My dear cousin, I, as a child,will go by thy direction.

1478
01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:00.500
Toward Ludlow then, forwe'll not stay behind.

1479
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:16.600
Good morrow, neighbor.

1480
01:21:18.370 --> 01:21:20.330
Whither away so fast?

1481
01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:25.330
I promise you, I scarcelyknow myself.

1482
01:21:25.330 --> 01:21:26.970
Hear you the news abroad?

1483
01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:28.730
Yes, that the king isdead.

1484
01:21:28.730 --> 01:21:30.270
Oh, ill news, by our lady.

1485
01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:32.430
Seldom comes the better.

1486
01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:35.700
I fear, I fear 'twillprove a giddy world.

1487
01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.070
Neighbors, God speed.

1488
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:38.400
Give you good morrow, sir.

1489
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.230
Doth the news hold of goodKing Edward's death?

1490
01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:42.800
Aye, sir, it is too true;God help the while.

1491
01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:46.070
Then, masters, look to seea troublous world.

1492
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:49.070
No, no; by God's goodgrace, his son shall reign.

1493
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:52.070
Woe to that land that'sgoverned by a child.

1494
01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:55.000
In him there is a hope ofgovernment,

1495
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.930
which, in his nonagecouncil under him,

1496
01:21:57.930 --> 01:22:00.300
and in his full and ripenedyears, himself, no doubt,

1497
01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:03.170
shall then and till thengovern well.

1498
01:22:03.170 --> 01:22:04.870
So stood the state whenHenry the Sixth

1499
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:07.000
was crowned in Paris butat nine months old.

1500
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.530
Stood the state so?

1501
01:22:08.530 --> 01:22:10.830
No, no, good friends, Godwot.

1502
01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:14.230
For then this land wasfamously enriched

1503
01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:15.730
with politic gravecounsel.

1504
01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:19.600
Then the king had virtuousuncles to protect his grace.

1505
01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:22.400
Why, so hath this, both byhis father and mother.

1506
01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.200
Better it were they allcame by the father

1507
01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:27.630
or by his father therewere none at all,

1508
01:22:27.630 --> 01:22:30.600
for emulation, who shallnow be nearest,

1509
01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:34.000
will touch us all toonear, if God prevent not.

1510
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.130
O, full of danger is theduke of Gloucester

1511
01:22:37.130 --> 01:22:40.370
and the queen's sons andbrothers haught and proud.

1512
01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:43.900
And were they to be ruledand not to rule,

1513
01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:47.070
This sickly land mightsolace as before.

1514
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:50.530
Come, come. We fear theworst.

1515
01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:52.770
All will be well.

1516
01:22:52.770 --> 01:22:56.770
When clouds are seen, wisemen put on their cloaks.

1517
01:22:56.770 --> 01:23:00.130
When great leaves fall,then winter is at hand.

1518
01:23:00.130 --> 01:23:03.500
When the sun sets, whodoth not look for night?

1519
01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:07.670
Untimely storms makes menexpect a dearth.

1520
01:23:07.670 --> 01:23:11.030
All may be well, but ifGod sort it so,

1521
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:12.670
'tis more than we deserveor I expect.

1522
01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:15.070
Truly, the hearts of menare full of fear.

1523
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:17.000
You cannot reason almostwith a man

1524
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.170
that looks not heavily andfull of dread.

1525
01:23:19.170 --> 01:23:23.500
Before the days of change,still is it so.

1526
01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.330
By a divine instinct,

1527
01:23:25.330 --> 01:23:27.900
men's minds mistrustensuing danger.

1528
01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:32.470
As by proof, we see thewaters swell before aboisterous storm.

1529
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:34.830
But leave it all to God.

1530
01:23:34.830 --> 01:23:36.000
Whither away?

1531
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.170
Marry, I was sent for tothe justices.

1532
01:23:38.170 --> 01:23:40.330
Yes, so was I.

1533
01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:41.900
I'll bear you company.

1534
01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:56.730
Last night, I hear, theylay at Stony-Stratford,

1535
01:23:56.730 --> 01:23:59.300
and at Northampton, theydo rest tonight.

1536
01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:02.530
Tomorrow or next day, theywill be here.

1537
01:24:02.530 --> 01:24:05.470
I long with all my heartto see the prince.

1538
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:07.900
I hope he is much grownsince last I saw him.

1539
01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:09.070
But I hear no.

1540
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:10.230
They say my son of York

1541
01:24:10.230 --> 01:24:12.000
hath almost overta'en himin his growth.

1542
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.830
Aye, Mother, but I wouldnot have it so.

1543
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:17.000
Why, my good cousin, it isgood to grow.

1544
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.400
Grandam, one night, as wedid sit at supper,

1545
01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:23.530
my uncle Rivers talked howI did grow more than mybrother.

1546
01:24:23.530 --> 01:24:25.600
"Aye," quoth my uncleGloucester,

1547
01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.230
"Small herbs have grace;great weeds do grow apace."

1548
01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:32.070
And since, methinks, Iwould not grow so fast,

1549
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:34.630
because sweet flowers areslow and weeds make haste.

1550
01:24:34.630 --> 01:24:38.070
Good faith, good faith,the saying did not hold

1551
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:39.770
in him that did object thesame to thee.

1552
01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:42.530
He was the wretchedestthing when he was young,

1553
01:24:42.530 --> 01:24:44.700
so long a-growing and soleisurely,

1554
01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:47.330
that if this rule were true,he should be gracious.

1555
01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:51.200
And so, no doubt, he is,my gracious madam.

1556
01:24:52.330 --> 01:24:56.230
I hope he is, but yet letmothers doubt.

1557
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.600
Now, by my troth, if I hadbeen remembered,

1558
01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.900
I could have given myuncle's grace a flout,

1559
01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:05.170
to touch his growth nearerthan he touched mine.

1560
01:25:05.170 --> 01:25:06.330
How, my young York?

1561
01:25:06.330 --> 01:25:07.430
I pray thee, let me hearit.

1562
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:09.200
Marry, they say my unclegrew so fast

1563
01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:11.530
that he could gnaw a crustat two hours old.

1564
01:25:11.530 --> 01:25:13.900
'Twas full two years ere Icould get a tooth.

1565
01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:16.800
Grandam, this would havebeen a biting jest.

1566
01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.200
I pray thee, pretty York,who told thee this?

1567
01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.800
Grandam, his nurse.

1568
01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:21.900
His nurse?

1569
01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:23.970
Why, she was dead ere thouwas born.

1570
01:25:23.970 --> 01:25:26.930
If 'twere not she, Icannot tell who told me.

1571
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:28.870
Parlous boy, go to. Youare too shrewd!

1572
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:31.400
Good madam, be not angrywith the child.

1573
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:34.870
Pitchers have ears.

1574
01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:37.470
Here is a messenger.

1575
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:39.700
What news?

1576
01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:43.030
Such news, my lord, asgrieves me to report.

1577
01:25:47.930 --> 01:25:49.170
How doth the prince?

1578
01:25:49.170 --> 01:25:51.300
Well, madam, and inhealth.

1579
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:55.330
What is thy news?

1580
01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:59.270
Lord Rivers and Lord Greyare sent to Pomfret,

1581
01:25:59.270 --> 01:26:01.430
and with them Sir ThomasVaughan, prisoners.

1582
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:04.230
Who hath committed them?

1583
01:26:04.230 --> 01:26:06.270
The mighty dukesGloucester and Buckingham.

1584
01:26:06.270 --> 01:26:07.670
For what offense?

1585
01:26:07.670 --> 01:26:09.400
The sum of all I can, Ihave disclosed.

1586
01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.900
Why or for what the nobleswere committed

1587
01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:13.000
is all unknown to me, mygracious lord.

1588
01:26:18.530 --> 01:26:21.030
Ay, me.

1589
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:24.200
I see the ruin of myhouse.

1590
01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:28.700
The tiger now hath seizedthe gentle hind.

1591
01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:30.730
Insulting tyranny beginsto jot

1592
01:26:30.730 --> 01:26:34.100
upon the innocent andaweless throne.

1593
01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:39.100
Welcome, destruction,blood, and massacre.

1594
01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:43.730
I see as in a map the endof all.

1595
01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:52.330
Accursed and unquietwrangling days,

1596
01:26:52.330 --> 01:26:55.830
how many of you have mineeyes beheld.

1597
01:26:57.130 --> 01:27:01.270
My husband lost his lifeto get the crown.

1598
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:04.130
And often, up and down, mysons were tossed,

1599
01:27:04.130 --> 01:27:06.770
for me to joy and weeptheir gain and loss.

1600
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:10.300
And being seated anddomestic broils cleanover-blown,

1601
01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:14.200
themselves, theconquerors, make war uponthemselves,

1602
01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:17.200
brother to brother, bloodto blood,

1603
01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.370
self against self.

1604
01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:22.930
O, preposterous andfrantic outrage,

1605
01:27:22.930 --> 01:27:25.130
end thy damned spleen,

1606
01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:28.870
or let me die, to look onearth no more.

1607
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:33.270
Come, come, my boy; wewill to sanctuary.

1608
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:34.300
Madam, farewell.

1609
01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:36.400
Stay. I will go with you.

1610
01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:37.600
You have no cause.

1611
01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.230
My gracious lady, go,

1612
01:27:39.230 --> 01:27:41.770
and thither bear yourtreasure and your goods.

1613
01:27:42.370 --> 01:27:44.830
For my part,

1614
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:48.230
I'll resign unto yourgrace the seal I keep.

1615
01:27:48.230 --> 01:27:50.570
and so betide to me

1616
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:52.670
as well I tender you andall of yours.

1617
01:27:52.670 --> 01:27:53.800
Go.

1618
01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:56.200
I'll conduct you to thesanctuary.

1619
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:12.630
Welcome, sweet prince, toLondon, to your chamber.

1620
01:28:12.630 --> 01:28:15.300
Welcome, dear cousin, mythoughts' sovereign.

1621
01:28:24.570 --> 01:28:27.600
The weary way hath madeyou melancholy.

1622
01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.770
No, Uncle, but our crosseson the way

1623
01:28:31.770 --> 01:28:35.100
have made it tedious,wearisome, and heavy.

1624
01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:41.300
I want more uncles here towelcome me.

1625
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:48.630
Sweet prince, the untaintedvirtue of your years

1626
01:28:48.630 --> 01:28:51.630
hath not yet dived intothe world's deceit.

1627
01:28:51.630 --> 01:28:55.130
Nor more can youdistinguish of a man thanof his outward show,

1628
01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:56.430
which God, he knows,

1629
01:28:56.430 --> 01:28:59.030
seldom or never jumpethwith the heart.

1630
01:28:59.030 --> 01:29:02.270
Those uncles which youwant were dangerous.

1631
01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:04.470
Your grace attended totheir sugared words

1632
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:07.400
but looked not on thepoison of their hearts.

1633
01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:10.630
God keep you from them andfrom such false friends.

1634
01:29:10.630 --> 01:29:13.830
God keep me from falsefriends.

1635
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.570
But they were none.

1636
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.730
My lord, the mayor ofLondon comes to greet you.

1637
01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:23.900
God bless your grace withhealth and happy days.

1638
01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:27.330
I thank you, good my lord,and thank you all.

1639
01:29:35.530 --> 01:29:37.330
I thought my mother and mybrother York

1640
01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:39.170
would long ere this havemet us on the way.

1641
01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:43.470
Fie, what a slug isHastings, that he comesnot to tell us

1642
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:45.430
whether they will come orno.

1643
01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:49.130
And in good time, herecomes the sweating lord.

1644
01:29:49.130 --> 01:29:50.530
Welcome, my lord.

1645
01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:54.070
What, will our mothercome?

1646
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:57.100
On what occasion, God heknows, not I,

1647
01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:59.170
the queen your mother andyour brother York

1648
01:29:59.170 --> 01:30:00.870
have taken sanctuary.

1649
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:02.930
The tender prince wouldfain have come with me

1650
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:04.070
to meet your grace

1651
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:06.500
but by his mother wasperforce withheld.

1652
01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:09.600
Fie, what an indirect andpeevish course

1653
01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.930
is this of hers.

1654
01:30:10.930 --> 01:30:13.670
Lord cardinal, will yourgrace persuade the queen

1655
01:30:13.670 --> 01:30:15.000
to send the Duke of York

1656
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.870
unto his princely brotherpresently?

1657
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:19.170
If she deny, LordHastings, go with him

1658
01:30:19.170 --> 01:30:21.270
and from her jealous armspluck him perforce.

1659
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:27.370
My lord of Buckingham, ifmy weak oratory

1660
01:30:27.370 --> 01:30:30.330
can from his mother winthe Duke of York,

1661
01:30:30.330 --> 01:30:32.900
anon expect him here.

1662
01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:38.070
But if she be obdurate tomild entreaties,

1663
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:39.570
God in Heaven forbid

1664
01:30:39.570 --> 01:30:43.070
we should infringe the holyprivilege of blessedsanctuary.

1665
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:48.130
Not for all this landwould I be guilty of sodeep a sin.

1666
01:30:48.130 --> 01:30:50.570
You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,

1667
01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:53.370
too ceremonious andtraditional.

1668
01:30:53.370 --> 01:30:56.830
Weigh it but with thegrossness of this age.

1669
01:30:56.830 --> 01:30:58.870
You break not sanctuary inseizing him.

1670
01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:01.670
The benefit thereof isalways granted

1671
01:31:01.670 --> 01:31:04.270
to those whose dealingshave deserved the place

1672
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:07.200
and those who have the witto claim the place.

1673
01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.700
This prince hath neitherclaimed it nor deserved it

1674
01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:12.000
and therefore, in mineopinion, cannot have it.

1675
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Then taking him fromthence that is not there,

1676
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.030
you break no privilege norcharter there.

1677
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:20.630
Oft have I heard ofsanctuary men,

1678
01:31:20.630 --> 01:31:23.830
but sanctuary children...

1679
01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:29.870
Never till now.

1680
01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:40.330
My lord, you shallo'errule my mind for once.

1681
01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:44.570
Come on, Lord Hastings;will you go with me?

1682
01:31:46.330 --> 01:31:48.370
I go, my lord.

1683
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:51.130
Good lords...

1684
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:55.630
Make all the speedy hasteyou may.

1685
01:32:03.170 --> 01:32:04.770
Say, Uncle Gloucester...

1686
01:32:06.770 --> 01:32:07.970
If our brother come,

1687
01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:09.970
where shall we sojourntill our coronation?

1688
01:32:09.970 --> 01:32:14.270
Where it seems best untoyour royal self.

1689
01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:16.770
If I may counsel you, someday or two,

1690
01:32:16.770 --> 01:32:19.630
your highness shall reposeyou at the Tower,

1691
01:32:19.630 --> 01:32:22.600
then where you please andshall be thought most fit

1692
01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:24.830
for your best health andrecreation.

1693
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:27.900
I do not like the tower ofany place.

1694
01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:38.500
Did Julius Caesar buildthat place, my lord?

1695
01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:41.370
He did, my gracious lord,begin that place,

1696
01:32:41.370 --> 01:32:44.070
which since succeedingages have re-edified.

1697
01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:48.370
Is it upon record or elsereported successively

1698
01:32:48.370 --> 01:32:49.930
from age to age, he builtit?

1699
01:32:49.930 --> 01:32:53.500
Upon record, my graciouslord.

1700
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:57.170
But say, my lord, it werenot registered,

1701
01:32:57.170 --> 01:33:00.130
methinks the truth shouldlive from age to age,

1702
01:33:00.130 --> 01:33:02.530
as 'twere retailed to allposterity,

1703
01:33:02.530 --> 01:33:04.700
even to the generalall-ending day.

1704
01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:09.000
So wise so young, theysay, do ne'er live long.

1705
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
What say you, Uncle?

1706
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.530
I say without characters,fame lives long.

1707
01:33:14.530 --> 01:33:17.900
That Julius Caesar was afamous man.

1708
01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:20.600
With what his valor didenrich his wit,

1709
01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:24.000
his wit set down to makehis valor live.

1710
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.600
Death makes no conquest ofthis conqueror,

1711
01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:30.500
for now he lives in fame,though not in life.

1712
01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:32.770
I'll tell you what, mycousin Buckingham.

1713
01:33:32.770 --> 01:33:34.330
What, my gracious lord?

1714
01:33:34.330 --> 01:33:36.170
An if I live until I be aman,

1715
01:33:36.170 --> 01:33:38.230
I'll win our ancient rightin France again

1716
01:33:38.230 --> 01:33:41.030
or die a soldier as Ilived a king.

1717
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:45.030
Short summers lightly havea forward spring.

1718
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:47.970
Now in good time, herecomes the Duke of York.

1719
01:33:47.970 --> 01:33:49.430
Richard of York.

1720
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:52.370
How fares our lovingbrother?

1721
01:33:52.370 --> 01:33:55.930
Well, my dread lord; somust I call you now.

1722
01:33:57.430 --> 01:34:02.430
Aye, brother, to ourgrief, as it is yours.

1723
01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:05.930
Too late he died thatmight have kept that title

1724
01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:10.500
which by his death hathlost much majesty.

1725
01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:14.900
How fares our cousin,noble lord of York?

1726
01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:17.200
I thank you, gentle uncle.

1727
01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:21.070
O, my lord, you said that idleweeds are fast in growth.

1728
01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:23.570
The prince my brother hathoutgrown me far.

1729
01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:25.300
He hath, my lord.

1730
01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:27.100
And therefore, is he idle?

1731
01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:31.530
O, my fair cousin, I mustnot say so.

1732
01:34:31.530 --> 01:34:34.070
Then is he more beholdingto you than I.

1733
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:36.500
He may command me as mysovereign,

1734
01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:39.030
but you have power in meas in a kinsman.

1735
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:41.030
I pray you, uncle, give methis dagger.

1736
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:43.470
My dagger, little cousin?

1737
01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:44.830
With all my heart.

1738
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:46.530
A beggar, brother?

1739
01:34:46.530 --> 01:34:49.170
Of my kind uncle, that Iknow will give

1740
01:34:49.170 --> 01:34:52.000
and being but a toy, whichis no grief to give.

1741
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.530
A greater gift than thatI'll give my cousin.

1742
01:34:54.530 --> 01:34:55.670
A greater gift.

1743
01:34:55.670 --> 01:34:57.630
Then that's the sword toit.

1744
01:34:57.630 --> 01:35:00.770
Aye, gentle cousin, wereit light enough.

1745
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:03.830
O, then I see you will butpart with light gifts.

1746
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:05.970
In weightier things,you'll say a beggar nay.

1747
01:35:07.770 --> 01:35:10.700
It is too heavy for yourgrace to wear.

1748
01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:12.770
I weigh it lightly, wereit heavier.

1749
01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:15.100
What? Would you have myweapon, little lord?

1750
01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:17.270
I would, that I mightthank you as you call me.

1751
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:18.270
How?

1752
01:35:18.270 --> 01:35:19.600
Little.

1753
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.070
My lord of York will stillbe cross in talk.

1754
01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:31.800
Uncle, your grace knowshow to bear with him.

1755
01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:34.170
You mean to bear me, notto bear with me.

1756
01:35:34.170 --> 01:35:36.700
Uncle, my brother mocksboth you and me.

1757
01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:38.900
Because that I am littlelike an ape,

1758
01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:41.470
he thinks that you shouldbear me on your shoulders.

1759
01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:49.500
With what a sharp-providedwit he reasons.

1760
01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.470
To mitigate the scorn hegives his uncle,

1761
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:53.800
he prettily and aptlytaunts himself.

1762
01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:55.630
So cunning and so young iswonderful.

1763
01:35:55.630 --> 01:35:58.100
My lord, will it pleaseyou pass along?

1764
01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:00.800
Myself and my good cousinBuckingham will to your mother

1765
01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:03.670
to entreat of her to meetyou at the Tower andwelcome you.

1766
01:36:03.670 --> 01:36:06.630
What? Will you go unto theTower, my lord?

1767
01:36:06.630 --> 01:36:10.000
My lord protector needswill have it so.

1768
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.730
I shall not sleep in quietat the Tower.

1769
01:36:12.730 --> 01:36:14.330
Why? What should you fear?

1770
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:17.370
Marry, my uncle Clarence'angry ghost.

1771
01:36:17.370 --> 01:36:19.970
My grandam told me he wasmurdered there.

1772
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:21.870
I fear no uncles dead.

1773
01:36:21.870 --> 01:36:24.700
Nor none that live, Ihope.

1774
01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:27.170
An if they live, I hope Ineed not fear.

1775
01:36:29.170 --> 01:36:30.500
But come, my lord.

1776
01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:33.530
With a heavy heart,thinking on them,

1777
01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:36.000
go I unto the Tower.

1778
01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.230
Think you, my lord, thislittle prating York

1779
01:36:53.230 --> 01:36:55.570
was not incensed by hissubtle mother

1780
01:36:55.570 --> 01:36:59.200
to taunt and scorn youthus opprobriously?

1781
01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:01.330
No doubt, no doubt.

1782
01:37:01.330 --> 01:37:03.700
O, 'tis a parlous boy:

1783
01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:07.600
bold, quick, ingenious,forward, capable.

1784
01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:10.130
He is all the mother'sfrom the top to toe.

1785
01:37:10.130 --> 01:37:13.300
Well, let them rest.

1786
01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:14.670
Come hither, Catesby.

1787
01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.670
Thou art sworn as deeplyto effect what we intend

1788
01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:25.930
as closely to conceal whatwe impart.

1789
01:37:25.930 --> 01:37:27.070
What think'st thou?

1790
01:37:27.070 --> 01:37:28.330
Is it not an easy matter

1791
01:37:28.330 --> 01:37:30.970
to make William LordHastings of our mind

1792
01:37:30.970 --> 01:37:32.800
for the installment ofthis noble duke

1793
01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:35.270
in the seat royal of thisfamous isle?

1794
01:37:36.670 --> 01:37:39.130
He for his father's sakeso loves the prince

1795
01:37:39.130 --> 01:37:42.270
that he will not be won toaught against him.

1796
01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:45.470
What think'st thou, then,of Stanley?

1797
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:47.170
What will he?

1798
01:37:47.170 --> 01:37:49.570
He will do all in all asHastings doth.

1799
01:37:52.330 --> 01:37:54.930
Well, then, no more butthis.

1800
01:37:54.930 --> 01:37:56.830
Go, gentle Catesby.

1801
01:37:56.830 --> 01:38:00.270
And as it were far off,sound thou Lord Hastings,

1802
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:02.700
how he doth stand affectedto our purpose.

1803
01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:04.330
And summon him tomorrow tothe Tower

1804
01:38:04.330 --> 01:38:05.500
to sit about thecoronation.

1805
01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.170
If thou dost find himtractable to us,

1806
01:38:07.170 --> 01:38:09.530
encourage him, and tellhim all our reasons.

1807
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:14.300
If he be leaden, icy-cold,unwilling,

1808
01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:17.330
be thou so too and sobreak off the talk

1809
01:38:17.330 --> 01:38:19.570
and give us notice of hisinclination,

1810
01:38:19.570 --> 01:38:22.070
for we tomorrow holddivided councils

1811
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:25.130
wherein thyself shallhighly be employed.

1812
01:38:25.130 --> 01:38:27.100
Commend me to LordHastings.

1813
01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:28.730
Tell him, Catesby,

1814
01:38:28.730 --> 01:38:31.230
his ancient knot ofdangerous adversaries

1815
01:38:31.230 --> 01:38:34.330
tomorrow are let blood atPomfret Castle.

1816
01:38:34.330 --> 01:38:37.030
And bid my lord for joy ofthis good news

1817
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:40.500
give Mistress Shore onegentle kiss the more.

1818
01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:44.000
Good Catesby, go; effectthis business soundly.

1819
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.200
My good lords both, withall the heed I can.

1820
01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:49.330
Shall we hear from you,Catesby, ere we sleep?

1821
01:38:49.330 --> 01:38:51.270
You shall, my lord.

1822
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:54.200
At Crosby Place, thereshall you find us both.

1823
01:38:57.530 --> 01:39:00.430
Now, my lord, what shallwe do

1824
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:04.900
if we perceive LordHastings will not yield toour complots?

1825
01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:06.700
Chop off his head, man.

1826
01:39:08.230 --> 01:39:11.770
Somewhat we will do.

1827
01:39:11.770 --> 01:39:14.170
And look, when I am king,

1828
01:39:14.170 --> 01:39:17.200
claim thou of me theearldom of Hereford

1829
01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.070
and all the movables

1830
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:21.270
whereof the king mybrother was possessed.

1831
01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:27.900
I'll claim that promise atyour grace's hands.

1832
01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:30.700
And look to have ityielded with all kindness.

1833
01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:35.400
Come, let us sup betimes,

1834
01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:39.500
that afterwards, we may digestour complots in some form.

1835
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:46.900
My lord.

1836
01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:50.470
My lord.

1837
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:52.600
Who knocks?

1838
01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:54.270
One from the Lord Stanley.

1839
01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:05.870
What is't o'clock?

1840
01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:07.230
Upon the stroke of four.

1841
01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:13.800
Cannot my Lord Stanleysleep these tedious nights?

1842
01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:15.470
So it appears by that Ihave to say.

1843
01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:19.170
First, he commends him tothe noble sir.

1844
01:40:19.170 --> 01:40:20.330
And what then?

1845
01:40:20.330 --> 01:40:23.300
Then sends upon yourlordship that this night,

1846
01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:28.030
he dreamt the boar hadrazed off his helm.

1847
01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:30.670
Besides, he says there aretwo councils kept

1848
01:40:30.670 --> 01:40:32.830
and that may be determinedat the one

1849
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:35.670
which may make you and himto rue at the other.

1850
01:40:35.670 --> 01:40:37.900
Therefore he sends to knowyour lordship's pleasure,

1851
01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:39.630
if you will presently takehorse with him

1852
01:40:39.630 --> 01:40:41.900
and with all speed postwith him toward the north

1853
01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:44.170
and shun the danger thathis soul divines.

1854
01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:49.170
Go, fellow, go.

1855
01:40:49.170 --> 01:40:51.800
Return unto thy lord.

1856
01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:56.000
Bid him not fear theseparated council.

1857
01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
His honor and myself areat the one,

1858
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.600
and at the other is mygood friend Catesby,

1859
01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:03.170
where nothing can proceedthat toucheth us

1860
01:41:03.170 --> 01:41:05.730
whereof I shall not haveintelligence.

1861
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.370
Tell him his fears areshallow, without instance.

1862
01:41:12.630 --> 01:41:15.670
And for his dreams, Iwonder he is so simple

1863
01:41:15.670 --> 01:41:18.770
to trust the mockery ofunquiet slumbers.

1864
01:41:18.770 --> 01:41:21.770
To fly the boar before theboar pursues

1865
01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:24.270
were to incense the boarto follow us

1866
01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:26.930
and make pursuit where hedid mean no chase.

1867
01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:30.000
Go.

1868
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.930
Bid thy master rise andcome to me,

1869
01:41:32.930 --> 01:41:35.270
and we will both togetherto the Tower,

1870
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:39.470
where he shall see, theboar will use us kindly.

1871
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:41.530
I'll go, my lord, and tellhim what you say.

1872
01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:45.430
Oh.

1873
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:48.130
Many good morrows to mynoble lord.

1874
01:41:48.130 --> 01:41:51.030
Good morrow, Catesby.

1875
01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:53.770
You are early stirring.

1876
01:41:53.770 --> 01:41:55.300
What news?

1877
01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:58.130
What news, in this, ourtottering state?

1878
01:41:58.130 --> 01:42:00.670
O, it is a reeling worldindeed, my lord.

1879
01:42:00.670 --> 01:42:03.730
And I believe 'twill neverstand upright

1880
01:42:03.730 --> 01:42:07.470
till Richard wear thegarland of the realm.

1881
01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:09.770
How wear the garland?

1882
01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:12.200
O, dost thou mean thecrown?

1883
01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:13.330
Aye, my good lord.

1884
01:42:14.670 --> 01:42:16.970
I'll have this crown ofmine cut from my shoulders

1885
01:42:16.970 --> 01:42:19.370
before I'll see the crownso foul misplaced.

1886
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.600
But canst thou guess thathe doth aim at it?

1887
01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:25.870
Aye, on my life.

1888
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:28.570
And hopes to find youforward upon his party

1889
01:42:28.570 --> 01:42:30.170
for the gain thereof.

1890
01:42:30.170 --> 01:42:32.330
And thereupon he sends youthis good news:

1891
01:42:32.330 --> 01:42:36.030
that this same very day,your enemies,

1892
01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:39.900
the kindred of the queen,must die at Pomfret.

1893
01:42:45.770 --> 01:42:48.030
Indeed, I am no mournerfor this news...

1894
01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:51.930
Because they have beenstill my adversaries.

1895
01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:57.630
But that I'll give myvoice on Richard's side,

1896
01:42:57.630 --> 01:43:01.230
to bar my master's heirsin true descent,

1897
01:43:01.230 --> 01:43:02.800
God knows I will not doit.

1898
01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:04.030
To the death.

1899
01:43:05.170 --> 01:43:07.970
God keep your lordship inthat gracious mind.

1900
01:43:10.970 --> 01:43:13.430
But I shall laugh at thisa twelve-month hence,

1901
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:15.770
that they which brought mein my master's hate,

1902
01:43:15.770 --> 01:43:17.770
I live to look upon theirtragedy.

1903
01:43:22.230 --> 01:43:23.930
O, Catesby.

1904
01:43:23.930 --> 01:43:25.800
Ere a fortnight make meolder,

1905
01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:28.030
I'll send some packingthat yet think not on't.

1906
01:43:30.230 --> 01:43:32.730
'Tis a vile thing to die,my gracious lord,

1907
01:43:32.730 --> 01:43:35.070
when men are unpreparedand look not for it.

1908
01:43:35.070 --> 01:43:37.330
O monstrous, monstrous.

1909
01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:43.430
So falls it out withRivers, Vaughan, Grey.

1910
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:45.770
And so 'twill do with somemen else

1911
01:43:45.770 --> 01:43:48.430
who think themselves assafe as thou and I,

1912
01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:50.970
who, as thou know'st,

1913
01:43:50.970 --> 01:43:53.530
are dear to princelyRichard and to Buckingham.

1914
01:43:53.530 --> 01:43:57.200
The princes both make highaccount of you,

1915
01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.300
for they account his headupon the bridge.

1916
01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:01.070
I know they do.

1917
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:02.870
And I have well deservedit.

1918
01:44:04.730 --> 01:44:08.270
Come on, come on.

1919
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:11.030
Where is your boar spear,man?

1920
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:13.870
Fear you the boar and goso unprovided?

1921
01:44:13.870 --> 01:44:15.300
My lord, good morrow.

1922
01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.030
Morrow, Catesby.

1923
01:44:19.770 --> 01:44:22.570
You may jest on, but bythe holy rood,

1924
01:44:22.570 --> 01:44:26.270
I do not like theseseveral councils, I...

1925
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:30.870
My lord, I hold my life asdear as you.

1926
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:33.730
And never in my days, I doprotest,

1927
01:44:33.730 --> 01:44:36.170
was it so precious to meas 'tis now.

1928
01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:40.530
Think you but that I knowour state secure,

1929
01:44:40.530 --> 01:44:43.800
I would be so triumphantas I am?

1930
01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:45.130
The lords at Pomfret,

1931
01:44:45.130 --> 01:44:46.970
when they rode fromLondon, were jocund

1932
01:44:46.970 --> 01:44:48.830
and supposed their stateswere sure,

1933
01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:52.070
and they indeed had nocause to mistrust,

1934
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:54.870
and yet you see how soonthe day o'ercast.

1935
01:44:56.530 --> 01:45:00.300
This sudden stab of rancorI misdoubt.

1936
01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:06.570
Pray God, I say, I prove aneedless coward.

1937
01:45:08.830 --> 01:45:10.170
What, shall we toward theTower?

1938
01:45:10.170 --> 01:45:11.400
The night is spent.

1939
01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:12.870
Come, come; have with you.

1940
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:30.670
Wot you what, my lord?

1941
01:45:30.670 --> 01:45:34.200
Today the lords you talkedof are beheaded.

1942
01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:43.300
They for their truth mightbetter wear their heads

1943
01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:45.770
than some that have accusedthem wear their hats.

1944
01:45:47.370 --> 01:45:49.200
Come, my lord; let's away.

1945
01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:50.200
Go on before.

1946
01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:51.670
I'll talk with this goodfellow.

1947
01:45:57.370 --> 01:45:59.670
Well met, Hastings.

1948
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:02.370
How goes the world withthee?

1949
01:46:02.370 --> 01:46:04.970
The better that yourlordship please to ask.

1950
01:46:04.970 --> 01:46:06.700
I tell thee, man, 'tisbetter with me now

1951
01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:08.200
than when I met thee last.

1952
01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:09.400
Where now we meet,

1953
01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:11.000
then was I going prisonerto the Tower

1954
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.800
by the suggestion of thequeen's allies.

1955
01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:15.130
But now I tell thee-- keepit to thyself--

1956
01:46:15.130 --> 01:46:17.470
this day, those enemiesare put to death,

1957
01:46:17.470 --> 01:46:19.770
and I in better state thane'er I was.

1958
01:46:19.770 --> 01:46:22.000
God hold it to yourhonor's good content.

1959
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.700
Gramercy, Hastings.

1960
01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:26.070
There.

1961
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:27.070
Drink that for me.

1962
01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:29.500
Why, thank you, Robert.

1963
01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:31.100
Well met, my lord.

1964
01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:34.030
I am glad to see yourhonor.

1965
01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:35.870
I thank you kindly, goodSir John.

1966
01:46:37.570 --> 01:46:39.670
I am in your debt for yourlast exercise.

1967
01:46:41.970 --> 01:46:44.230
Come the next Sabbath, Iwill content you.

1968
01:46:47.530 --> 01:46:50.400
What, talking with apriest, lord chamberlain?

1969
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:52.830
Your friends at Pomfret,they do need the priest.

1970
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:55.670
Your honor hath noshriving work in hand.

1971
01:46:55.670 --> 01:46:58.830
Good faith, and when I metthis holy man,

1972
01:46:58.830 --> 01:47:00.830
the men you talked of cameinto my mind.

1973
01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:04.300
What, go you toward theTower?

1974
01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:05.600
I do, my lord.

1975
01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:07.230
But long I cannot staythere.

1976
01:47:07.230 --> 01:47:10.030
I shall return before yourlordship thence.

1977
01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:12.670
Hey, like enough, for Istay dinner there.

1978
01:47:12.670 --> 01:47:15.030
And supper too, althoughthou know'st it not.

1979
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:17.300
I'll wait upon yourlordship.

1980
01:47:18.430 --> 01:47:20.670
Come. Shall we go?

1981
01:47:20.670 --> 01:47:22.700
I'll wait upon yourlordship.

1982
01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:04.070
Sir Richard Ratcliffe, letme tell thee this:

1983
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:06.770
Today shalt thou behold asubject die

1984
01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:10.130
for truth, for duty, andfor loyalty!

1985
01:48:10.130 --> 01:48:13.000
God bless the prince fromall the pack of you.

1986
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.430
A knot you are of damnedbloodsuckers!

1987
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:18.600
You live that shall crywoe for this hereafter!

1988
01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:21.900
Dispatch; the limit ofyour lives is out.

1989
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:33.900
O Pomfret, Pomfret!

1990
01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:37.730
O thou bloody prison,

1991
01:48:37.730 --> 01:48:42.070
fatal and ominous to noblepeers.

1992
01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:44.730
Within the guilty closureof thy walls,

1993
01:48:44.730 --> 01:48:48.070
Richard II here was hackedto death.

1994
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:52.270
And for more slander tothy dismal seat,

1995
01:48:52.270 --> 01:48:57.130
we give to thee ourguiltless blood to drink.

1996
01:48:58.270 --> 01:49:01.830
Now Margaret's curse isfallen upon our heads

1997
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:05.070
when she exclaimed onHastings, you, and I,

1998
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:08.130
for standing by whenRichard stabbed her son.

1999
01:49:08.130 --> 01:49:09.700
Then cursed she Richard.

2000
01:49:12.130 --> 01:49:15.000
Then cursed sheBuckingham.

2001
01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:19.770
Then cursed she Hastings.

2002
01:49:21.070 --> 01:49:22.670
O, remember, God,

2003
01:49:22.670 --> 01:49:26.700
to hear her prayer forthem as now for us

2004
01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:30.230
and for my sister and herprincely sons.

2005
01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:33.600
Be satisfied, dear God,with our true blood,

2006
01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:38.030
which, as thou know'st,unjustly must be spilt.

2007
01:49:38.670 --> 01:49:40.470
Make haste.

2008
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:42.630
The hour of death isexpiate.

2009
01:49:59.670 --> 01:50:01.670
Come, Grey.

2010
01:50:01.670 --> 01:50:03.300
Come, Vaughan.

2011
01:50:04.730 --> 01:50:06.470
Let us here embrace.

2012
01:50:07.870 --> 01:50:12.100
Farewell until we meetagain in Heaven.

2013
01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.270
Now, noble peers, thecause why we are met

2014
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:22.270
is to determine of thecoronation.

2015
01:50:22.270 --> 01:50:23.930
In God's name, speak.

2016
01:50:23.930 --> 01:50:25.730
When is the royal day?

2017
01:50:25.730 --> 01:50:27.770
Is all things ready forthe royal time?

2018
01:50:27.770 --> 01:50:31.630
It is, and wants butnomination.

2019
01:50:31.630 --> 01:50:34.170
Tomorrow, then, I judgethe happy day.

2020
01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:39.970
Who knows the lordprotector's mind herein?

2021
01:50:39.970 --> 01:50:42.530
Who is most inward withthe noble duke?

2022
01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:46.600
Your grace, we think, shouldsoonest know his mind.

2023
01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:48.300
We know each other'sfaces.

2024
01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:49.600
For our hearts,

2025
01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:51.900
he knows no more of minethan I of yours

2026
01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:55.070
or I of his, my lord, thanyou of mine.

2027
01:50:55.070 --> 01:50:57.930
Lord Hastings, you and heare near in love.

2028
01:50:59.070 --> 01:51:02.200
I thank his grace. I knowhe loves me well.

2029
01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:03.870
But for his purpose in thecoronation,

2030
01:51:03.870 --> 01:51:05.470
I have not sounded him,

2031
01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:09.670
nor he delivered his graciouspleasure any way therein.

2032
01:51:09.670 --> 01:51:12.230
But you, my honorablelords, may name the time,

2033
01:51:12.230 --> 01:51:14.870
and in the duke's behalf,I'll give my voice,

2034
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:17.770
which, I presume, he'lltake in gentle part.

2035
01:51:17.770 --> 01:51:20.000
Ah, in happy time, herecomes the duke himself.

2036
01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.430
My noble lords and cousinsall, good morrow.

2037
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.670
I have been long asleeper.

2038
01:51:27.670 --> 01:51:30.930
But I trust my absence dothneglect no great design

2039
01:51:30.930 --> 01:51:33.100
which by my presence mighthave been concluded.

2040
01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:35.200
Had not you come upon yourcue, my lord,

2041
01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:38.530
William, Lord Hastings,had pronounced your part--

2042
01:51:38.530 --> 01:51:41.570
I mean, your voice-- forcrowning of the king.

2043
01:51:42.930 --> 01:51:47.230
Than my lord Hastings, noman might be bolder.

2044
01:51:47.230 --> 01:51:50.100
His lordship knows me welland loves me well.

2045
01:51:56.700 --> 01:51:58.630
My lord of Ely.

2046
01:51:58.630 --> 01:51:59.900
When I was last inHolborn,

2047
01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:02.600
I saw good strawberries inyour garden there.

2048
01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:04.430
I do beseech you send forsome of them.

2049
01:52:04.430 --> 01:52:06.230
Marry, and will, my lord,with all my heart.

2050
01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:11.930
Cousin of Buckingham, aword with you.

2051
01:52:16.130 --> 01:52:19.030
Catesby hath soundedHastings in our business

2052
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:21.470
and finds the testygentleman so hot

2053
01:52:21.470 --> 01:52:24.000
that he will lose his headere give consent

2054
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.500
his master's child, asworshipfully he terms it,

2055
01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:30.170
shall lose the royalty ofEngland's throne.

2056
01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:33.230
Withdraw yourself awhile.

2057
01:52:33.230 --> 01:52:34.570
I'll go with you.

2058
01:52:47.070 --> 01:52:51.170
We have not yet set downthis day of triumph.

2059
01:52:51.170 --> 01:52:54.830
Tomorrow, in my judgment,is too sudden,

2060
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:56.570
for I myself am not sowell provided

2061
01:52:56.570 --> 01:52:58.870
as else I would be werethe day prolonged.

2062
01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:03.000
Where is my lord, the dukeof Gloucester?

2063
01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.100
I have sent for thesestrawberries.

2064
01:53:14.170 --> 01:53:17.830
His grace looks cheerfullyand smooth today.

2065
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:19.970
There's some conceit orother likes him well

2066
01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:21.970
when that he bids goodmorrow with such spirit.

2067
01:53:23.170 --> 01:53:24.770
I think there's never aman in Christendom

2068
01:53:24.770 --> 01:53:27.230
can lesser hide his loveor hate than he,

2069
01:53:27.230 --> 01:53:30.670
for by his face, straightshall you know his heart.

2070
01:53:30.670 --> 01:53:33.170
What of his heart perceiveyou in his face

2071
01:53:33.170 --> 01:53:35.130
by any livelihood heshowed today?

2072
01:53:35.130 --> 01:53:38.270
Marry, that with no manhere he is offended.

2073
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:41.130
For were he, he had shownit in his looks.

2074
01:53:41.130 --> 01:53:43.770
I pray God he be not, Isay.

2075
01:54:02.530 --> 01:54:05.030
I pray you all,

2076
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:08.000
tell me what they deservethat do conspire my death

2077
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.700
with devilish plots ofdamned witchcraft

2078
01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:12.670
and that have prevailedupon my body

2079
01:54:12.670 --> 01:54:14.400
with their hellish charms.

2080
01:54:17.530 --> 01:54:20.800
The tender love I bearyour grace, my lord,

2081
01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:23.500
makes me most forward inthis princely presence

2082
01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:26.970
to doom the offenders,whatsoe'er they be.

2083
01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:30.470
I say, my lord, they havedeserved death.

2084
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:33.030
Then be your eyes thewitness of their evil.

2085
01:54:34.830 --> 01:54:36.330
See how I am bewitched.

2086
01:54:38.830 --> 01:54:40.400
Behold.

2087
01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:43.770
Mine arm is, like a blastedsapling, withered up.

2088
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.870
And this is Edward's wife,that monstrous witch,

2089
01:54:47.870 --> 01:54:50.530
consorted with that harlotstrumpet Shore,

2090
01:54:50.530 --> 01:54:53.600
that by their witchcraftthus have marked me.

2091
01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:55.870
If they have done thisdeed, my noble lord--

2092
01:54:55.870 --> 01:54:58.930
If! Thou protector of thisdamned strumpet!

2093
01:54:58.930 --> 01:55:01.030
Talk'st thou to me of"ifs"?

2094
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:02.330
Thou art a traitor.

2095
01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:03.630
Off with his head!

2096
01:55:03.630 --> 01:55:05.100
Now by Saint Paul, Iswear,

2097
01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:07.030
I will not dine until Isee the same.

2098
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:08.870
Lovel and Ratcliffe, lookthat it be done.

2099
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:10.930
The rest that love me,rise and follow me.

2100
01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:47.570
O woe.

2101
01:55:50.530 --> 01:55:51.930
Woe for England.

2102
01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:56.500
Not a whit for me.

2103
01:55:56.500 --> 01:56:00.170
For I, too fond, mighthave prevented this.

2104
01:56:00.170 --> 01:56:03.330
Stanley did dream the boardid raze his helm.

2105
01:56:05.170 --> 01:56:07.930
And I did scorn it anddistained to fly.

2106
01:56:10.330 --> 01:56:13.730
Three times today, myfoot-cloth horse did stumble

2107
01:56:13.730 --> 01:56:17.100
and started when he lookedupon the Tower,

2108
01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:19.630
as loath to bear me to theslaughterhouse.

2109
01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:26.130
Oh, now I need the priestthat spake to me.

2110
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:31.630
I now repent I told thepursuivant as too triumphing

2111
01:56:31.630 --> 01:56:35.500
how mine enemies today atPomfret bloodily werebutchered

2112
01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:38.700
and I myself secure ingrace and favor.

2113
01:56:43.970 --> 01:56:47.670
Oh, Margaret, Margaret.

2114
01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:54.600
Now thy heavy curse islighted on poor Hastings'wretched head.

2115
01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:56.070
Come, come, dispatch.

2116
01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:58.330
The duke would be atdinner.

2117
01:56:58.330 --> 01:56:59.400
Make a short shrift.

2118
01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:01.170
He longs to see your head.

2119
01:57:04.330 --> 01:57:08.700
O momentary grace ofmortal men,

2120
01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:13.370
which we more hunt forthan the grace of God.

2121
01:57:13.370 --> 01:57:16.000
Who builds his hope in airof your good looks

2122
01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.970
lives like a drunkensailor on a mast,

2123
01:57:18.970 --> 01:57:21.000
ready with every nod totumble down

2124
01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.570
into the fatal bowels ofthe deep.

2125
01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:25.370
Come, come, dispatch.

2126
01:57:25.370 --> 01:57:27.000
'Tis bootless to exclaim.

2127
01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.370
Bloody Richard!

2128
01:57:32.730 --> 01:57:34.270
Miserable England.

2129
01:57:36.970 --> 01:57:39.570
I prophesy the fearfulesttime to thee

2130
01:57:39.570 --> 01:57:41.700
that ever wretched agehath looked upon.

2131
01:57:51.570 --> 01:57:53.530
Come.

2132
01:57:53.530 --> 01:57:56.030
Lead me to the block.

2133
01:57:56.030 --> 01:57:59.030
Bear him my head.

2134
01:57:59.030 --> 01:58:01.530
They smile at me whoshortly shall be dead.

2135
01:58:34.970 --> 01:58:36.270
Come, cousin.

2136
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:38.470
Canst thou quake andchange thy color,

2137
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:40.570
murder thy breath in themiddle of a word,

2138
01:58:40.570 --> 01:58:42.330
and then again begin andstop again

2139
01:58:42.330 --> 01:58:44.930
as if thou were distraughtand mad with terror?

2140
01:58:44.930 --> 01:58:47.700
Tut, I can counterfeit thedeep tragedian.

2141
01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:49.000
Speak and look back.

2142
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.330
Pry on every side,

2143
01:58:50.330 --> 01:58:52.630
Tremble and start atwagging of a straw,

2144
01:58:52.630 --> 01:58:54.470
intending deep suspicion.

2145
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:58.300
Ghastly looks are at myservice like enforced smiles.

2146
01:58:58.300 --> 01:59:00.630
And both are ready intheir offices at any time

2147
01:59:00.630 --> 01:59:02.500
to grace my stratagems.

2148
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:05.230
What, is Catesby gone?

2149
01:59:05.230 --> 01:59:06.300
He is.

2150
01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:08.030
And see, he brings themayor along.

2151
01:59:09.070 --> 01:59:10.170
Lord mayor!

2152
01:59:10.170 --> 01:59:11.470
Look to the drawbridgethere!

2153
01:59:11.470 --> 01:59:12.500
Hark, a drum!

2154
01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:13.830
Catesby, o'erlook thewalls.

2155
01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:14.830
Lord mayor, the reason wehave sent--

2156
01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:16.000
Look back! Defend thee!

2157
01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Here are enemies!

2158
01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.530
O God and our innocence,defend and guard us.

2159
01:59:20.530 --> 01:59:22.870
Be patient; they are friends,Ratcliffe and Lovel.

2160
01:59:27.170 --> 01:59:29.530
Here is the head of thatignoble traitor,

2161
01:59:29.530 --> 01:59:32.830
the dangerous andunsuspected Hastings.

2162
01:59:35.870 --> 01:59:38.200
So dear I loved the manthat I must weep.

2163
01:59:41.930 --> 01:59:44.370
I took him for theplainest harmless creature

2164
01:59:44.370 --> 01:59:47.800
that breathed upon theearth a Christian,

2165
01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:51.700
made him my book whereinmy soul recorded

2166
01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:53.630
the history of all hersecret thoughts.

2167
01:59:54.970 --> 01:59:58.170
So smooth he daubed hisvice with show of virtue

2168
01:59:58.170 --> 02:00:01.030
that his apparent openguilt omitted--

2169
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:03.630
I mean, his conversationwith Shore's wife--

2170
02:00:03.630 --> 02:00:06.400
he lived from allattainder of suspects.

2171
02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:12.170
Well, well.

2172
02:00:12.170 --> 02:00:15.370
He was the covertestsheltered traitor!

2173
02:00:15.370 --> 02:00:18.000
Would you imagine oralmost believe,

2174
02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.830
were't not that by greatpreservation

2175
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:20.870
we live to tell it,

2176
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:22.070
that the subtle traitorthis day

2177
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:23.470
had plotted in the councilhouse

2178
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:26.170
to murder me and my goodlord of Gloucester?

2179
02:00:26.170 --> 02:00:27.630
Had he done so?

2180
02:00:27.630 --> 02:00:28.630
What?

2181
02:00:28.630 --> 02:00:30.870
Think you we are Turks orinfidels?

2182
02:00:30.870 --> 02:00:33.100
Or that we would againstthe form of law

2183
02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:35.670
proceed thus rashly in thevillain's death,

2184
02:00:35.670 --> 02:00:37.730
but that the extreme perilof the case--

2185
02:00:37.730 --> 02:00:40.670
the peace of England andour persons' safety--

2186
02:00:40.670 --> 02:00:42.400
enforced us to thisexecution?

2187
02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:45.300
Now, fair befall you, hedeserved his death.

2188
02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:48.770
And your good graces bothhave well proceeded

2189
02:00:48.770 --> 02:00:52.730
to warn false traitorsfrom the like attempts.

2190
02:00:52.730 --> 02:00:54.600
I never looked for betterat his hands

2191
02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:57.530
after he once fell in withMistress Shore.

2192
02:00:57.530 --> 02:00:59.400
Yet had we not determinedhe should die

2193
02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:01.670
until your lordship cameto see his end,

2194
02:01:01.670 --> 02:01:04.630
which now the loving hasteof these our friends,

2195
02:01:04.630 --> 02:01:07.270
something against ourmeaning have prevented

2196
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:08.530
because, my lord,

2197
02:01:08.530 --> 02:01:09.800
we would have had youheard the traitor speak

2198
02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:11.200
and timorously confess

2199
02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:13.070
the manner and the purposeof his treason,

2200
02:01:13.070 --> 02:01:14.170
that you might well havesignified

2201
02:01:14.170 --> 02:01:15.430
the same unto thecitizens,

2202
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:18.130
who haply may misconstrue usin him and wail his death.

2203
02:01:19.170 --> 02:01:23.030
But, my good lord, yourgraces' word shall serve

2204
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:27.530
as well as I had seen andheard him speak.

2205
02:01:27.530 --> 02:01:31.530
And do not doubt, rightnoble princes both,

2206
02:01:31.530 --> 02:01:34.530
but I'll acquaint ourduteous citizens

2207
02:01:34.530 --> 02:01:38.030
with all your justproceedings in this cause.

2208
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:40.500
And to that end, we wishedyour lordship here:

2209
02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:43.570
to avoid the censures ofthe carping world.

2210
02:01:43.570 --> 02:01:46.400
Which, since you came toolate of our intent,

2211
02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:49.830
yet witness what you hearwe did intend.

2212
02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:56.570
So, my good lord mayor,

2213
02:01:56.570 --> 02:01:58.370
we bid farewell.

2214
02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:24.130
Go after, after, cousinBuckingham!

2215
02:02:24.130 --> 02:02:26.700
The mayor towards Guildhallhies him all in post.

2216
02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:29.700
There, at your meet'stadvantage of the time,

2217
02:02:29.700 --> 02:02:31.900
infer the bastardy ofEdward's children.

2218
02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:34.170
Moreover, urge his hatefulluxury

2219
02:02:34.170 --> 02:02:36.600
and bestial appetite inchange of lust,

2220
02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:39.670
which stretched unto theirservants, daughters, wives,

2221
02:02:39.670 --> 02:02:42.330
even where his raging eyeand savage heart

2222
02:02:42.330 --> 02:02:45.270
without control lusted tomake a prey.

2223
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:47.600
Nay, for a need, thus farcome near my person.

2224
02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:49.900
Tell them when that mymother went of child

2225
02:02:49.900 --> 02:02:51.400
of that insatiate Edward,

2226
02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:54.900
noble York, my princelyfather, then had wars inFrance

2227
02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:56.830
and by true computation ofthe time

2228
02:02:56.830 --> 02:02:58.900
found that the issue wasnot his begot,

2229
02:02:58.900 --> 02:03:00.700
which well appeared in hislineaments,

2230
02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:03.170
being nothing like thenoble duke my father.

2231
02:03:03.170 --> 02:03:06.100
Yet touch this sparingly,as 'twere far off,

2232
02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:08.330
because, my lord, you knowmy mother lives.

2233
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:10.900
Doubt not, my lord, I'llplay the orator

2234
02:03:10.900 --> 02:03:13.900
as if the golden fee for whichI plead were for myself.

2235
02:03:15.730 --> 02:03:17.600
And so, my lord, adieu.

2236
02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:20.230
If you thrive well, bringthem to Baynard's Castle,

2237
02:03:20.230 --> 02:03:21.600
where you will find mewell accompanied

2238
02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:23.600
with reverend fathers andwell-learned bishops.

2239
02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:25.200
I go, and towards three orfour o'clock,

2240
02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:28.600
look for the news that theGuildhall affords.

2241
02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:30.830
Go, Lovel, with all speedto Doctor Shaw.

2242
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:32.200
Go thou to Friar Penker.

2243
02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:35.330
Bid them both meet mewithin this hour atBaynard's Castle.

2244
02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:37.900
Now will I go to take someprivy order

2245
02:03:37.900 --> 02:03:40.070
to draw the brats ofClarence out of sight

2246
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:44.070
and to give notice that nomanner person have any time

2247
02:03:44.070 --> 02:03:46.700
recourse unto the princes.

2248
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:49.770
Ratcliffe.

2249
02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:19.300
Here is the indictment ofthe good lord Hastings,

2250
02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:26.530
which in a set hand fairlyis engrossed

2251
02:04:26.530 --> 02:04:30.870
that it may be today reado'er in Paul's.

2252
02:04:33.070 --> 02:04:37.930
And mark how well thesequel hangs together.

2253
02:04:39.570 --> 02:04:44.300
Eleven hours I have spentto write it over,

2254
02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:47.500
for yesternight by Catesbywas it sent me.

2255
02:04:48.730 --> 02:04:51.170
The precedent was full aslong a-doing.

2256
02:04:53.100 --> 02:04:58.900
And yet within these fivehours, Hastings lived,

2257
02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:02.300
untainted, unexamined,free, at liberty.

2258
02:05:03.500 --> 02:05:06.670
Here's a good world thewhile.

2259
02:05:06.670 --> 02:05:11.330
Who is so gross that cannotsee this palpable device?

2260
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:18.830
Yet who is so bold butsays he sees it not?

2261
02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:26.630
Bad is the world, and allwill come to naught

2262
02:05:26.630 --> 02:05:30.500
when such ill dealing mustbe seen in thought.

2263
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:37.270
How now? How now? What saythe citizens?

2264
02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:39.070
Now, by the holy mother ofour Lord,

2265
02:05:39.070 --> 02:05:41.370
the citizens are mum, saynot a word.

2266
02:05:42.570 --> 02:05:44.730
Touched you the bastardyof Edward's children?

2267
02:05:44.730 --> 02:05:45.800
I did.

2268
02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:47.170
With his contract withLady Lucy

2269
02:05:47.170 --> 02:05:49.130
and his contract by deputyin France,

2270
02:05:49.130 --> 02:05:51.430
the insatiate greedinessof his desire

2271
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:53.430
and his enforcement of thecity wives,

2272
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:55.070
his tyranny for trifle,

2273
02:05:55.070 --> 02:05:57.600
his own bastardy, as being got,your father then in France,

2274
02:05:57.600 --> 02:06:00.570
and his resemblance beingnot like the duke.

2275
02:06:00.570 --> 02:06:04.700
Withal, I did infer yourlineaments

2276
02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:06.830
being the right idea ofyour father

2277
02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:10.900
both in your form andnobleness of mind.

2278
02:06:10.900 --> 02:06:12.970
Laid open all yourvictories in Scotland,

2279
02:06:12.970 --> 02:06:15.130
your discipline in war,your wisdom in peace,

2280
02:06:15.130 --> 02:06:18.300
your bounty, virtue, fairhumility.

2281
02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:21.070
Indeed, left nothing fittingfor your purpose untouched

2282
02:06:21.070 --> 02:06:22.670
or slightly handled indiscourse.

2283
02:06:22.670 --> 02:06:24.330
And when mine oratory drewto an end,

2284
02:06:24.330 --> 02:06:26.130
I bid them that did lovetheir country's good

2285
02:06:26.130 --> 02:06:28.500
cry "God save Richard,England's royal king."

2286
02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:29.730
And did they so?

2287
02:06:29.730 --> 02:06:30.830
No.

2288
02:06:30.830 --> 02:06:33.630
God help me, they spakenot a word

2289
02:06:33.630 --> 02:06:35.700
but like dumb statues orbreathing stones,

2290
02:06:35.700 --> 02:06:37.370
stared each on other andlooked deadly pale,

2291
02:06:37.370 --> 02:06:38.830
which, when I saw, Ireprehended them

2292
02:06:38.830 --> 02:06:41.230
and asked the mayor whatmeant this willful silence.

2293
02:06:41.230 --> 02:06:42.530
His answer was,

2294
02:06:42.530 --> 02:06:44.500
the people were not usedto being spoke to

2295
02:06:44.500 --> 02:06:45.870
but by the recorder.

2296
02:06:45.870 --> 02:06:47.800
Then he was urged to tellmy tale again,

2297
02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:50.400
"Thus saith the duke, thushath the duke inferred,"

2298
02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:52.700
but nothing spake inwarrant from himself.

2299
02:06:52.700 --> 02:06:53.930
When he had done,

2300
02:06:53.930 --> 02:06:56.230
some followers of mine ownat the lower end of the hall

2301
02:06:56.230 --> 02:06:57.630
hurled up their caps,

2302
02:06:57.630 --> 02:07:00.270
and some ten voices cried,"God save King Richard."

2303
02:07:00.270 --> 02:07:03.030
Thus I took the vantage ofthose few.

2304
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:06.130
"Thanks, gentle citizensand friends," quoth I.

2305
02:07:06.130 --> 02:07:08.970
"This general applause andcheerful shout

2306
02:07:08.970 --> 02:07:11.670
argues your wisdoms andyour love to Richard"

2307
02:07:11.670 --> 02:07:14.800
and even here brake offand came away.

2308
02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:16.530
What tongueless blockswere they!

2309
02:07:16.530 --> 02:07:17.530
Would they not speak?

2310
02:07:17.530 --> 02:07:18.700
No.

2311
02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:21.070
Will not the mayor thenand his brethren come?

2312
02:07:24.030 --> 02:07:25.800
The mayor is here at hand.

2313
02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:27.370
Intend some fear.

2314
02:07:27.370 --> 02:07:31.030
Be not you spoke with butby mighty suit.

2315
02:07:31.030 --> 02:07:33.170
And look you get a prayerbook in your hand

2316
02:07:33.170 --> 02:07:35.970
and stand between twochurchmen, good my lord.

2317
02:07:35.970 --> 02:07:39.100
For on that ground, I'llbuild a holy descant

2318
02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:41.200
and be not easily won toour request.

2319
02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:45.100
Play the maid's part, stillanswer nay, and take it.

2320
02:07:45.100 --> 02:07:46.800
I go.

2321
02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:48.330
And if you plead as wellfor them

2322
02:07:48.330 --> 02:07:50.430
as I can say nay to theefor myself,

2323
02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:52.530
no doubt we bring it to ahappy issue.

2324
02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:55.230
Go; go up to the leads.

2325
02:07:55.230 --> 02:07:56.430
The lord mayor knocks.

2326
02:08:05.870 --> 02:08:07.670
Oh, welcome, my lord.

2327
02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:11.400
I dance attendance here.

2328
02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:14.230
I think the duke will notbe spoke withal.

2329
02:08:14.230 --> 02:08:15.500
Oh, now, Catesby.

2330
02:08:15.500 --> 02:08:17.400
What says your lord to myrequest?

2331
02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:19.330
He doth entreat yourgrace, my noble lord,

2332
02:08:19.330 --> 02:08:21.930
to visit him tomorrow ornext day.

2333
02:08:21.930 --> 02:08:25.000
He is within, with tworight reverend fathers,

2334
02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:26.630
divinely bent tomeditation,

2335
02:08:26.630 --> 02:08:29.430
and in no worldly suitswould he be moved

2336
02:08:29.430 --> 02:08:31.930
to draw him from his holyexercise.

2337
02:08:31.930 --> 02:08:35.070
Return, good Catesby, tothe gracious duke.

2338
02:08:35.070 --> 02:08:38.600
Tell him myself, themayor, and aldermen

2339
02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:40.800
in deep designs and matterof great moment,

2340
02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:43.470
no less importing than ourgeneral good,

2341
02:08:43.470 --> 02:08:47.970
are come to have someconference with his grace.

2342
02:08:47.970 --> 02:08:50.300
I'll signify so much untohim straight.

2343
02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:57.670
Ah, ha, my lord, thisprince is not an Edward.

2344
02:08:57.670 --> 02:09:00.730
He is not lolling on alewd love bed

2345
02:09:00.730 --> 02:09:03.870
but on his knees atmeditation,

2346
02:09:03.870 --> 02:09:07.500
not dallying with a braceof courtesans

2347
02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:10.370
but meditating with twodeep divines,

2348
02:09:10.370 --> 02:09:15.070
not sleeping to engrosshis idle body,

2349
02:09:15.070 --> 02:09:19.330
but praying to enrich hiswatchful soul.

2350
02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:24.300
Happy were England wouldthis virtuous prince

2351
02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:27.330
take on his grace thesovereignty thereof.

2352
02:09:27.330 --> 02:09:30.870
But sure, I fear, we shallnot win him to it.

2353
02:09:30.870 --> 02:09:35.630
Marry, God defend hisgrace should say us nay.

2354
02:09:35.630 --> 02:09:37.370
I fear he will.

2355
02:09:37.370 --> 02:09:39.330
Here Catesby comes again.

2356
02:09:39.330 --> 02:09:41.770
Now, Catesby, what sayshis grace?

2357
02:09:41.770 --> 02:09:44.100
He wonders to what end youhave assembled

2358
02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:46.630
such troops of citizens tocome to him,

2359
02:09:46.630 --> 02:09:49.070
his grace not being warnedthereof before.

2360
02:09:49.070 --> 02:09:52.670
He fears, my lord, youmean no good to him.

2361
02:09:53.970 --> 02:09:57.930
Sorry I am my noble cousinshould suspect me,

2362
02:09:57.930 --> 02:09:59.530
that I mean no good tohim.

2363
02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.430
By Heaven, we come to himin perfect love.

2364
02:10:05.670 --> 02:10:09.900
And so return and tell hisgrace.

2365
02:10:13.270 --> 02:10:16.370
When holy and devout religiousmen are at their beads,

2366
02:10:16.370 --> 02:10:18.370
'tis much to draw themthence,

2367
02:10:18.370 --> 02:10:20.800
so sweet is zealouscontemplation.

2368
02:10:33.730 --> 02:10:39.230
See where his grace stands:tween two clergymen.

2369
02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:43.000
Two props of virtue for aChristian prince,

2370
02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.170
to stay him from the fallof vanity.

2371
02:10:46.170 --> 02:10:50.130
And, see, a book of prayerin his hand,

2372
02:10:50.130 --> 02:10:52.670
true ornaments to know aholy man.

2373
02:10:56.970 --> 02:11:00.730
Famous Plantagenet,

2374
02:11:00.730 --> 02:11:04.500
most gracious prince,

2375
02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:06.270
lend favorable ear to ourrequest

2376
02:11:06.270 --> 02:11:08.670
and pardon us theinterruption of thy devotion

2377
02:11:08.670 --> 02:11:10.400
and right Christian zeal.

2378
02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:12.430
My lord, there needs nosuch apology.

2379
02:11:12.430 --> 02:11:14.470
I do beseech your grace topardon me,

2380
02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:17.130
who, earnest in theservice of my God,

2381
02:11:17.130 --> 02:11:20.170
deferred the visitation ofmy friends.

2382
02:11:20.170 --> 02:11:23.070
But leaving this, what isyour grace's pleasure?

2383
02:11:24.300 --> 02:11:28.970
Even that, I hope, whichpleaseth God above

2384
02:11:28.970 --> 02:11:32.970
and all good men of thisungoverned isle.

2385
02:11:32.970 --> 02:11:35.170
I do suspect I have donesome offense

2386
02:11:35.170 --> 02:11:37.400
that seems disgracious inthe city's eye

2387
02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:39.570
and that you come toreprehend my ignorance.

2388
02:11:39.570 --> 02:11:42.800
You have, my lord!

2389
02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:44.130
Would it might please yourgrace

2390
02:11:44.130 --> 02:11:45.800
on our entreaties to amendthat fault?

2391
02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:48.900
Else wherefore breathe Iin a Christian land?

2392
02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:53.800
Know then it is your faultthat you resign thesupreme seat,

2393
02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:55.530
the throne majestical,

2394
02:11:55.530 --> 02:11:57.900
the sceptered office ofyour ancestors

2395
02:11:57.900 --> 02:12:01.100
to the corruption of ablemished stock.

2396
02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:03.600
Whilst in the mildness ofyour sleepy thoughts,

2397
02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:06.200
which here we waken to ourcountry's good,

2398
02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:08.500
the noble isle doth wanther proper limbs.

2399
02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:11.330
Her face defaced withscars of infamy,

2400
02:12:11.330 --> 02:12:14.330
her royal stock graft withignoble plants,

2401
02:12:14.330 --> 02:12:17.570
which to recure, weheartily solicit yourgracious self

2402
02:12:17.570 --> 02:12:20.400
to take on you the chargeand kingly government

2403
02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:22.200
of this your land,

2404
02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:25.570
not as protector, steward,substitute,

2405
02:12:25.570 --> 02:12:28.470
or lowly factor foranother's gain,

2406
02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:30.970
but as successively fromblood to blood,

2407
02:12:30.970 --> 02:12:35.070
your right of birth, yourempery, your own.

2408
02:12:35.070 --> 02:12:36.600
For this, consorted withthe citizens,

2409
02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:39.100
your very worshipful andloving friends,

2410
02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:41.200
and by their vehementinstigation,

2411
02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:48.130
in this just cause come Ito move your grace.

2412
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:54.170
I cannot tell if to departin silence

2413
02:12:54.170 --> 02:12:56.130
or bitterly to speak inyour reproof

2414
02:12:56.130 --> 02:12:58.470
best fitteth my degree oryour condition.

2415
02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:02.530
If not to answer, youmight haply think

2416
02:13:02.530 --> 02:13:05.600
tongue-tied ambition, notreplying,

2417
02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:08.470
yielded to bear the goldenyoke of sovereignty

2418
02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:12.200
which fondly you wouldhere impose on me.

2419
02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:14.300
If to reprove you for thissuit of yours,

2420
02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:16.970
so seasoned with yourfaithful love to me,

2421
02:13:16.970 --> 02:13:20.130
then, on the other side, Ichecked my friends.

2422
02:13:20.130 --> 02:13:23.770
Therefore, to speak and toavoid the first

2423
02:13:23.770 --> 02:13:26.400
and then, in speaking, notto incur the last,

2424
02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:28.930
definitively thus I answeryou.

2425
02:13:28.930 --> 02:13:32.000
Your love deserves mythanks,

2426
02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:36.170
but my desert unmeritableshuns your high request.

2427
02:13:36.170 --> 02:13:39.700
First, if all obstacleswere cut away

2428
02:13:39.700 --> 02:13:41.670
and that my path were evento the crown,

2429
02:13:41.670 --> 02:13:45.230
as the ripe revenue anddue of birth,

2430
02:13:45.230 --> 02:13:48.000
yet so much is my povertyof spirit,

2431
02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.370
so mighty and so many mydefects,

2432
02:13:50.370 --> 02:13:53.170
that I would rather hideme from my greatness,

2433
02:13:53.170 --> 02:13:55.470
being a bark to brook nomighty sea,

2434
02:13:55.470 --> 02:13:58.230
than in my greatness covetto be hid

2435
02:13:58.230 --> 02:14:01.070
and in the vapor of myglory smothered.

2436
02:14:01.070 --> 02:14:04.630
But, God be thanked, thereis no need of me,

2437
02:14:04.630 --> 02:14:08.900
and much I need to helpyou, were there need.

2438
02:14:08.900 --> 02:14:11.700
The royal tree hath leftus royal fruit,

2439
02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:15.100
which, mellowed by thestealing hours of time,

2440
02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:17.270
will well become the seatof majesty

2441
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:20.900
and make, no doubt, ushappy by his reign.

2442
02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:23.530
On him I lay that youwould lay on me,

2443
02:14:23.530 --> 02:14:25.900
the right and fortune ofhis happy stars,

2444
02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:28.200
which God defend that Ishould wring from him.

2445
02:14:29.330 --> 02:14:34.700
My lord, this arguesconscience in your grace,

2446
02:14:34.700 --> 02:14:37.270
but the respects thereofare nice and trivial,

2447
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:40.230
all circumstances wellconsidered.

2448
02:14:40.230 --> 02:14:43.770
You say that Edward isyour brother's son.

2449
02:14:43.770 --> 02:14:46.630
So say we too...

2450
02:14:46.630 --> 02:14:48.800
but not by Edward's wife!

2451
02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:51.000
For first was he contractto Lady Lucy--

2452
02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.130
your mother lives awitness to his vow--

2453
02:14:53.130 --> 02:14:56.100
and afterwards by substitutebetroth'd to Bona,

2454
02:14:56.100 --> 02:14:59.630
sister to the king ofFrance.

2455
02:14:59.630 --> 02:15:04.070
These both put off a poorpetitioner,

2456
02:15:04.070 --> 02:15:07.670
a care-crazed mother tomany sons,

2457
02:15:07.670 --> 02:15:11.170
a beauty-waning anddistressed widow,

2458
02:15:11.170 --> 02:15:14.370
even in the afternoon ofher best days

2459
02:15:14.370 --> 02:15:18.070
made prize and purchase ofhis wanton eye,

2460
02:15:18.070 --> 02:15:21.930
seduced the pitch and theheight of his degree

2461
02:15:21.930 --> 02:15:28.200
to base declension andloathed bigamy.

2462
02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:32.300
By her in his unlawfulbed, he got this Edward,

2463
02:15:32.300 --> 02:15:34.000
whom our manners call theprince.

2464
02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:35.530
More bitterly could Iexpostulate,

2465
02:15:35.530 --> 02:15:37.870
save that for reverence tosome alive,

2466
02:15:37.870 --> 02:15:40.270
I give a sparing limit tomy tongue.

2467
02:15:40.270 --> 02:15:44.870
Therefore, good my lord,take to your royal self

2468
02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:47.000
this proffered benefit ofdignity,

2469
02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.330
if not to bless us and theland withal,

2470
02:15:49.330 --> 02:15:51.800
yet to draw forth yournoble ancestry

2471
02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:54.070
from the corruption ofabusing times

2472
02:15:54.070 --> 02:15:57.030
unto a lineal,true-derived course.

2473
02:15:57.030 --> 02:16:01.770
Do, good my lord; yourcitizens entreat you.

2474
02:16:01.770 --> 02:16:04.770
Refuse not, mighty lord,this proffered love.

2475
02:16:04.770 --> 02:16:09.900
O, make them joyful; granttheir lawful suit.

2476
02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:12.200
Alas, why would you heapthis care on me?

2477
02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:14.600
I am unfit for state andmajesty.

2478
02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:16.370
I do beseech you, take itnot amiss.

2479
02:16:16.370 --> 02:16:18.170
I cannot nor I will notyield to you.

2480
02:16:18.170 --> 02:16:19.900
If you refuse it-- as inlove and zeal,

2481
02:16:19.900 --> 02:16:22.630
loath to depose the child,your brother's son,

2482
02:16:22.630 --> 02:16:24.370
as well we know yourtenderness of heart

2483
02:16:24.370 --> 02:16:26.730
and gentle, kind,effeminate remorse,

2484
02:16:26.730 --> 02:16:29.170
which we have noted in youto your kindred

2485
02:16:29.170 --> 02:16:31.230
and equally indeed to allestates--

2486
02:16:31.230 --> 02:16:34.270
yet know, whether youaccept our suit or no,

2487
02:16:34.270 --> 02:16:37.530
your brother's son shallnever reign our king.

2488
02:16:37.530 --> 02:16:39.830
But we shall plant someother in the throne,

2489
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:44.630
to the disgrace anddownfall of your house.

2490
02:16:44.630 --> 02:16:49.430
And with this resolution,here we leave you.

2491
02:16:55.130 --> 02:16:58.270
Come, citizens.

2492
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:03.000
'Zounds!

2493
02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.770
I'll entreat no more.

2494
02:17:04.770 --> 02:17:06.400
O, do not swear, my lordof Buckingham.

2495
02:17:08.930 --> 02:17:10.600
Call them again, sweetprince.

2496
02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:12.530
Accept their suit.

2497
02:17:12.530 --> 02:17:15.470
If you deny them, all theland will rue it!

2498
02:17:15.470 --> 02:17:18.600
Will you enforce me to aworld of cares?

2499
02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:20.170
Call them again.

2500
02:17:20.170 --> 02:17:21.730
I am not made of stones

2501
02:17:21.730 --> 02:17:24.630
but penetrable to yourkind entreaties,

2502
02:17:24.630 --> 02:17:27.900
albeit against myconscience and my soul.

2503
02:17:33.230 --> 02:17:36.200
Cousin of Buckingham

2504
02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:37.830
and sage, grave men...

2505
02:17:40.930 --> 02:17:43.800
since you will bucklefortune on my back,

2506
02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:46.600
to bear her burden, whe'erI will or no,

2507
02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:50.500
I must have patience toendure the load.

2508
02:17:52.130 --> 02:17:56.930
But if black scandal orfoul-faced reproach

2509
02:17:56.930 --> 02:17:59.030
attend the sequel of yourimposition,

2510
02:17:59.030 --> 02:18:02.070
your mere enforcementshall acquittance me

2511
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:04.870
from all the impure blotsand stains thereof.

2512
02:18:04.870 --> 02:18:07.470
For God doth know and youmay partly see

2513
02:18:07.470 --> 02:18:09.630
how far I am from thedesire of this.

2514
02:18:09.630 --> 02:18:12.800
God bless your grace.

2515
02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:15.230
We see it and will say it.

2516
02:18:15.230 --> 02:18:17.400
In saying so, you shallbut say the truth.

2517
02:18:18.530 --> 02:18:25.400
Then I salute you withthis royal title.

2518
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:33.730
Long live Richard,England's worthy king!

2519
02:18:34.730 --> 02:18:36.870
Amen.

2520
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:38.600
Tomorrow may it please youto be crowned?

2521
02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:40.930
Even when you please, foryou will have it so.

2522
02:18:40.930 --> 02:18:43.170
Tomorrow, then, we willattend your grace.

2523
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:48.600
And so most joyfully, wetake our leave.

2524
02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:51.930
Come, let us to our holywork again.

2525
02:18:53.330 --> 02:18:55.900
Farewell, my cousin.

2526
02:18:55.900 --> 02:18:58.070
Farewell, gentle friends.

2527
02:19:18.270 --> 02:19:19.970
Who meets us here?

2528
02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:24.130
Daughter, well met.

2529
02:19:24.130 --> 02:19:25.530
God give your graces both

2530
02:19:25.530 --> 02:19:27.600
a happy and a joyful timeof day.

2531
02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:29.430
As much to you, goodsister.

2532
02:19:29.430 --> 02:19:30.270
Whither away?

2533
02:19:30.270 --> 02:19:31.900
No farther than the Tower

2534
02:19:31.900 --> 02:19:34.900
and as I guess, upon thelike devotion as yourselves:

2535
02:19:34.900 --> 02:19:37.270
to gratulate the gentleprinces there.

2536
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:39.030
Kind sister, thanks.

2537
02:19:39.030 --> 02:19:41.400
We'll enter all together.

2538
02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:44.530
And in good time, here thelieutenant comes.

2539
02:19:44.530 --> 02:19:46.030
Master lieutenant, prayyou, by your leave,

2540
02:19:46.030 --> 02:19:48.000
how doth the prince and myyoung son of York?

2541
02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:49.570
Right well, dear madam.

2542
02:19:49.570 --> 02:19:50.970
By your patience,

2543
02:19:50.970 --> 02:19:53.270
I may not suffer you tovisit them.

2544
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:55.400
The king hath strictlycharged the contrary.

2545
02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:56.730
The king?

2546
02:19:57.900 --> 02:19:58.870
Who's that?

2547
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:02.500
I mean the lord protector.

2548
02:20:02.500 --> 02:20:06.870
The Lord protect him fromthat kingly title.

2549
02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:09.900
Hath he set bounds betweentheir love and me?

2550
02:20:09.900 --> 02:20:12.130
I am their mother.

2551
02:20:12.130 --> 02:20:13.730
Who shall bar me fromthem?

2552
02:20:13.730 --> 02:20:15.400
I am their father'smother.

2553
02:20:15.400 --> 02:20:16.570
I will see them.

2554
02:20:16.570 --> 02:20:19.500
Their aunt I am in law, inlove their mother.

2555
02:20:19.500 --> 02:20:22.330
Then bring me to theirsights.

2556
02:20:22.330 --> 02:20:23.870
I'll bear thy blame

2557
02:20:23.870 --> 02:20:25.570
and take thy office fromthee, on my peril.

2558
02:20:25.570 --> 02:20:26.570
No, madam, no.

2559
02:20:26.570 --> 02:20:29.330
I may not leave it so.

2560
02:20:30.600 --> 02:20:34.270
I am bound by oath,

2561
02:20:34.270 --> 02:20:35.970
and therefore pardon me.

2562
02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:47.570
Let me but greet you,ladies, one hour hence,

2563
02:20:47.570 --> 02:20:50.200
and I'll salute your graceof York as mother

2564
02:20:50.200 --> 02:20:54.300
and reverend looker-on oftwo fair queens.

2565
02:20:54.300 --> 02:20:56.530
Come, madam, you muststraight to Westminster,

2566
02:20:56.530 --> 02:20:59.430
there to be crownedRichard's royal queen.

2567
02:21:00.270 --> 02:21:02.300
O, cut my lace asunder

2568
02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:04.130
that my pent heart mayhave some scope to beat,

2569
02:21:04.130 --> 02:21:06.000
or else I swoon with thisdead-killing news.

2570
02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:07.570
Be of good cheer, Mother.

2571
02:21:07.570 --> 02:21:09.800
How fares your grace?

2572
02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:11.870
O Dorset, speak not to me.Get thee gone.

2573
02:21:11.870 --> 02:21:13.700
Death and destruction dogsthee at the heels.

2574
02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:15.970
Thy mother's name isominous to children.

2575
02:21:15.970 --> 02:21:18.300
If thou wilt outstripdeath, go cross the seas

2576
02:21:18.300 --> 02:21:20.770
and live with Richmondfrom the reach of hell.

2577
02:21:20.770 --> 02:21:21.970
Go! Hie thee.

2578
02:21:21.970 --> 02:21:23.470
Hie thee from thisslaughterhouse,

2579
02:21:23.470 --> 02:21:25.830
lest thou increase thenumber of the dead

2580
02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:29.230
and make me die the thrallof Margaret's curse,

2581
02:21:29.230 --> 02:21:33.270
nor mother, wife, norEngland's counted queen!

2582
02:21:35.130 --> 02:21:38.000
Full of wise care is thisyour counsel, madam.

2583
02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.070
Take all the swiftadvantage of the hours.

2584
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:41.700
You shall have lettersfrom me to my son

2585
02:21:41.700 --> 02:21:43.330
in your behalf to meet youon the way.

2586
02:21:43.330 --> 02:21:45.170
Be not ta'en tardy byunwise delay.

2587
02:21:45.170 --> 02:21:48.370
O ill-dispersing wind ofmisery.

2588
02:21:48.370 --> 02:21:53.000
O my accursed womb, thebed of death.

2589
02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:56.070
A cockatrice hast thouhatched to the world

2590
02:21:56.070 --> 02:21:58.600
whose unavoided eye ismurderous.

2591
02:21:58.600 --> 02:22:00.670
Come, madam, come. I inall haste was sent.

2592
02:22:00.670 --> 02:22:03.300
And I with allunwillingness will go.

2593
02:22:05.700 --> 02:22:09.400
Oh, would to God that theinclusive verge of goldenmetal

2594
02:22:09.400 --> 02:22:12.670
that must round my browwere red-hot steel

2595
02:22:12.670 --> 02:22:14.970
to sear me to the brains.

2596
02:22:14.970 --> 02:22:17.970
Anointed let me be withdeadly venom

2597
02:22:17.970 --> 02:22:20.900
and die ere men can say"God save the queen."

2598
02:22:20.900 --> 02:22:22.500
Go, go, poor soul.

2599
02:22:22.500 --> 02:22:25.030
I envy not thy glory.

2600
02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:28.200
To feed my humor, wishthyself no harm.

2601
02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:29.930
No.

2602
02:22:29.930 --> 02:22:31.200
Why?

2603
02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:35.970
When he that is my husbandnow

2604
02:22:35.970 --> 02:22:38.700
came to me as I followedHenry's corse

2605
02:22:38.700 --> 02:22:42.130
when scarce the blood waswell-washed from his hands

2606
02:22:42.130 --> 02:22:45.070
which issued from my otherangel husband

2607
02:22:45.070 --> 02:22:49.400
and that dear saint whichthen I, weeping, followed.

2608
02:22:49.400 --> 02:22:53.600
O, when I say I look'd onRichard's face,

2609
02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:56.370
this was my wish:

2610
02:22:56.370 --> 02:22:58.500
"Be thou," quoth I,

2611
02:22:58.500 --> 02:23:04.330
"accursed for making me,so young, so old a widow.

2612
02:23:04.330 --> 02:23:09.030
"And when thou wed'st, letsorrow haunt thy bed.

2613
02:23:09.030 --> 02:23:12.400
"And be thy wife, if anybe so mad,

2614
02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:15.230
"more miserable by thelife of thee

2615
02:23:15.230 --> 02:23:19.100
than thou hast made me bymy dear lord's death."

2616
02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:26.000
Lo, ere I can repeat thiscurse again

2617
02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:29.230
within so small a time,

2618
02:23:29.230 --> 02:23:34.000
my woman's heart grossly grewcaptive to his honey words

2619
02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:38.230
and proved the subject ofmine own soul's curse,

2620
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:40.970
which hitherto hath heldmy eyes from rest.

2621
02:23:42.270 --> 02:23:44.770
For never yet one hour inhis bed

2622
02:23:44.770 --> 02:23:48.930
did I enjoy the golden dewof sleep

2623
02:23:48.930 --> 02:23:52.400
but with his timorousdreams was still awaked.

2624
02:23:54.030 --> 02:23:58.670
Besides, he hates me formy father, Warwick,

2625
02:23:58.670 --> 02:24:01.270
and will no doubt shortlybe rid of me.

2626
02:24:02.970 --> 02:24:05.470
Poor heart, adieu.

2627
02:24:05.470 --> 02:24:07.230
I pity thy complaining.

2628
02:24:07.230 --> 02:24:10.130
No more than with my soulI mourn for yours.

2629
02:24:10.130 --> 02:24:14.130
Farewell, thou woefulwelcomer of glory.

2630
02:24:14.130 --> 02:24:16.670
Adieu, poor soul thattakest thy leave of it.

2631
02:24:18.130 --> 02:24:21.800
Go thou to Richmond, andgood fortune guide thee.

2632
02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:26.330
Go thou to Richard, andgood angels tend thee.

2633
02:24:27.470 --> 02:24:31.300
Go thou to sanctuary, andgood thoughts possess thee.

2634
02:24:31.300 --> 02:24:35.270
I to my grave, where peaceand rest lie with me.

2635
02:24:41.700 --> 02:24:44.530
Stay.

2636
02:24:44.530 --> 02:24:46.600
Yet look back with me untothe Tower.

2637
02:24:48.030 --> 02:24:51.800
Pity, you ancient stones,those tender babes

2638
02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:54.730
whom envy hath immuredwithin your walls.

2639
02:24:54.730 --> 02:24:59.170
Rough cradle for suchlittle pretty ones.

2640
02:24:59.170 --> 02:25:02.170
Rude ragged nurse,

2641
02:25:02.170 --> 02:25:06.800
old sullen playfellow fortender princes,

2642
02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:09.900
use my babies well.

2643
02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:15.200
So foolish sorrow bidsyour stones farewell.

2644
02:25:52.170 --> 02:25:53.800
Stand all apart!

2645
02:26:02.730 --> 02:26:04.330
Cousin of Buckingham.

2646
02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:11.070
My gracious sovereign.

2647
02:26:11.070 --> 02:26:12.530
Give me thy hand.

2648
02:26:56.730 --> 02:27:00.200
Thus high, by thy adviceand thy assistance,

2649
02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:02.300
is King Richard seated.

2650
02:27:12.330 --> 02:27:14.670
But shall we wear theseglories for a day,

2651
02:27:14.670 --> 02:27:17.070
or shall they last and werejoice in them?

2652
02:27:17.070 --> 02:27:18.830
Still live they,

2653
02:27:18.830 --> 02:27:21.330
and forever let them last.

2654
02:27:21.330 --> 02:27:24.170
Ah, Buckingham,

2655
02:27:24.170 --> 02:27:25.770
now do I play the touch

2656
02:27:25.770 --> 02:27:28.530
to try if thou be currentgold indeed.

2657
02:27:28.530 --> 02:27:31.170
Young Edward lives.

2658
02:27:31.170 --> 02:27:33.470
Think now what I wouldspeak.

2659
02:27:33.470 --> 02:27:35.830
Say on, my loving lord.

2660
02:27:35.830 --> 02:27:38.130
Why, Buckingham, I say Iwould be king,

2661
02:27:38.130 --> 02:27:41.030
Why, so you are, mythrice-renowned lord.

2662
02:27:42.330 --> 02:27:44.700
Am I king?

2663
02:27:44.700 --> 02:27:45.900
'Tis so.

2664
02:27:45.900 --> 02:27:46.930
But Edward lives.

2665
02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:51.170
True, noble prince.

2666
02:27:51.170 --> 02:27:54.430
A bitter consequence thatEdward still should live:

2667
02:27:54.430 --> 02:27:56.230
"True, noble prince."

2668
02:27:58.900 --> 02:28:02.430
Cousin, thou wast not wontto be so dull.

2669
02:28:02.430 --> 02:28:03.600
Shall I be plain?

2670
02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:04.970
I wish the bastards dead,

2671
02:28:04.970 --> 02:28:06.670
and I would have itsuddenly performed.

2672
02:28:06.670 --> 02:28:07.600
What sayest thou now?

2673
02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:08.870
Speak suddenly. Be brief.

2674
02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:10.470
Your grace may do yourpleasure.

2675
02:28:12.970 --> 02:28:15.800
Tut, tut, thou art allice.

2676
02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:18.270
Thy kindness freezeth.

2677
02:28:21.570 --> 02:28:24.100
Say, have I thy consentthat they shall die?

2678
02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:30.300
Give me some littlebreath,

2679
02:28:30.300 --> 02:28:31.730
some pause, dear lord,

2680
02:28:31.730 --> 02:28:34.300
before I positively speakof this.

2681
02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:38.770
I will resolve you hereinpresently.

2682
02:28:50.570 --> 02:28:53.070
The king is angry.

2683
02:28:53.070 --> 02:28:55.900
See, he gnaws his lip.

2684
02:28:57.900 --> 02:29:02.200
I will converse withiron-witted fools andunrespective boys.

2685
02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:05.800
None are for me that look intome with considerate eyes.

2686
02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:09.070
High-reaching Buckinghamgrows circumspect.

2687
02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:12.170
Boy.

2688
02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:16.230
My lord.

2689
02:29:17.430 --> 02:29:19.730
Knowest thou not any whomcorrupting gold

2690
02:29:19.730 --> 02:29:22.200
will tempt unto a closeexploit of death?

2691
02:29:22.200 --> 02:29:24.800
I know a discontentedgentleman

2692
02:29:24.800 --> 02:29:28.030
whose humble means matchnot his haughty spirit.

2693
02:29:28.030 --> 02:29:30.870
Gold were as good astwenty orators

2694
02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:33.430
and will, no doubt, tempthim to any thing.

2695
02:29:33.430 --> 02:29:34.970
What is his name?

2696
02:29:34.970 --> 02:29:36.700
His name, my lord, isTyrrel.

2697
02:29:37.830 --> 02:29:39.230
I partly know the man.

2698
02:29:40.770 --> 02:29:42.230
Go, call him hither.

2699
02:29:46.770 --> 02:29:48.530
The deep-revolving wittyBuckingham

2700
02:29:48.530 --> 02:29:51.200
no more shall be theneighbor to my counsels.

2701
02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:53.630
Hath he so long held outwith me untired,

2702
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:55.300
and stops he now forbreath?

2703
02:29:55.300 --> 02:29:56.670
Well, be it so.

2704
02:29:56.670 --> 02:30:00.070
How now, Lord Stanley,what's the news?

2705
02:30:00.070 --> 02:30:01.430
Know, my loving lord,

2706
02:30:01.430 --> 02:30:04.570
the marquis Dorset, as Ihear, is fled to Richmond,

2707
02:30:04.570 --> 02:30:05.800
in the parts where heabides.

2708
02:30:10.300 --> 02:30:11.400
Come hither, Catesby.

2709
02:30:17.170 --> 02:30:18.930
Rumor it abroad that Anne,my wife,

2710
02:30:18.930 --> 02:30:20.170
is very grievous sick.

2711
02:30:20.170 --> 02:30:22.670
I will take order for herkeeping close.

2712
02:30:22.670 --> 02:30:24.900
Inquire me out somemean-poor gentleman

2713
02:30:24.900 --> 02:30:27.070
whom I will marry straightto Clarence' daughter.

2714
02:30:27.070 --> 02:30:29.070
The boy is foolish, and Ifear not him.

2715
02:30:31.700 --> 02:30:33.170
Look how thou dreamest.

2716
02:30:33.170 --> 02:30:34.430
I say again,

2717
02:30:34.430 --> 02:30:37.270
give out that Anne my queenis sick and like to die.

2718
02:30:38.300 --> 02:30:40.170
About it, for it stands memuch upon

2719
02:30:40.170 --> 02:30:42.430
to stop all hopes whosegrowth may damage me.

2720
02:30:45.900 --> 02:30:48.100
I must be married to mybrother's daughter,

2721
02:30:48.100 --> 02:30:51.000
or else my kingdom standson brittle glass.

2722
02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.430
Murder her brothers, andthen marry her:

2723
02:30:53.430 --> 02:30:55.570
uncertain way of gain.

2724
02:30:55.570 --> 02:30:59.100
But I am in so far in bloodthat sin will pluck on sin.

2725
02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:03.030
Tear-falling pity dwellsnot in this eye.

2726
02:31:05.570 --> 02:31:07.600
Is thy name Tyrrel?

2727
02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:10.100
James Tyrrel, and yourmost obedient subject.

2728
02:31:12.700 --> 02:31:14.000
Art thou, indeed?

2729
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:22.930
Prove me, my graciouslord.

2730
02:31:25.400 --> 02:31:28.100
Darest thou resolve tokill a friend of mine?

2731
02:31:28.100 --> 02:31:31.570
Please you, but I hadrather kill two enemies.

2732
02:31:31.570 --> 02:31:33.430
Why, then thou hast it.

2733
02:31:33.430 --> 02:31:35.270
Two deep enemies,

2734
02:31:35.270 --> 02:31:38.230
foes to my rest and mysweet sleep's disturbers

2735
02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:40.600
are they that I would havethee deal upon.

2736
02:31:42.070 --> 02:31:44.430
Tyrrel, I mean thosebastards in the Tower.

2737
02:31:46.130 --> 02:31:48.330
Let me have open means tocome to them,

2738
02:31:48.330 --> 02:31:51.100
and soon I'll rid you fromthe fear of them.

2739
02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:54.870
Thou singest sweet music.

2740
02:31:56.170 --> 02:31:57.500
Hark, come hither, Tyrrel.

2741
02:31:59.230 --> 02:32:01.300
Go by this token.

2742
02:32:01.300 --> 02:32:02.730
Rise and lend thine ear.

2743
02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:10.930
There is no more but so.

2744
02:32:10.930 --> 02:32:12.070
Say it is done,

2745
02:32:12.070 --> 02:32:14.000
and I will love thee andprefer thee for it.

2746
02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.130
I will dispatch itstraight.

2747
02:32:23.930 --> 02:32:28.330
My lord, I have consideredin my mind

2748
02:32:28.330 --> 02:32:30.330
the late request that youdid sound me in.

2749
02:32:32.030 --> 02:32:33.770
Well, let that rest.

2750
02:32:33.770 --> 02:32:36.530
Dorset is fled toRichmond.

2751
02:32:36.530 --> 02:32:38.600
I hear the news, my lord.

2752
02:32:38.600 --> 02:32:41.070
Stanley, he is your wife'sson.

2753
02:32:41.070 --> 02:32:42.770
Well, look unto it.

2754
02:32:42.770 --> 02:32:46.270
My lord, I claim the gift,my due by promise,

2755
02:32:46.270 --> 02:32:49.900
for which your honor andyour faith is pawned:

2756
02:32:49.900 --> 02:32:51.130
the earldom of Hereford

2757
02:32:51.130 --> 02:32:54.200
and the movables which youhave promised I shallpossess.

2758
02:32:54.200 --> 02:32:56.130
Stanley, look to yourwife.

2759
02:32:56.130 --> 02:32:59.000
If she convey letters toRichmond, you shall answer it.

2760
02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.270
What says your highness tomy just demand?

2761
02:33:01.270 --> 02:33:03.370
I do remember me, Henry VIdid prophesy

2762
02:33:03.370 --> 02:33:04.500
that Richmond should beking

2763
02:33:04.500 --> 02:33:07.130
when Richmond was a littlepeevish boy.

2764
02:33:07.130 --> 02:33:10.000
A king, perhaps, perhaps--

2765
02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:11.300
My lord.

2766
02:33:11.300 --> 02:33:13.500
How chance the prophetcould not at that timehave told me,

2767
02:33:13.500 --> 02:33:15.470
I being by, that I shouldkill him?

2768
02:33:15.470 --> 02:33:17.000
My lord, your promise forthe earldom--

2769
02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:18.330
Richmond.

2770
02:33:18.330 --> 02:33:20.100
When last I was at Exeter,

2771
02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:22.030
the mayor in courtesyshowed me the castle there

2772
02:33:22.030 --> 02:33:23.430
and called it Rougemont,

2773
02:33:23.430 --> 02:33:24.870
at which name I started

2774
02:33:24.870 --> 02:33:26.130
because a bard of Irelandtold me once

2775
02:33:26.130 --> 02:33:28.600
I should not live longafter I saw Richmond.

2776
02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:29.530
My lord.

2777
02:33:29.530 --> 02:33:31.600
Aye, what's't o'clock?

2778
02:33:33.230 --> 02:33:34.570
I am thus bold

2779
02:33:34.570 --> 02:33:36.800
to put your grace in mindof what you promised me.

2780
02:33:36.800 --> 02:33:38.130
Well, but what's'to'clock?

2781
02:33:39.700 --> 02:33:40.800
Upon the stroke of ten.

2782
02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:41.800
Then let it strike.

2783
02:33:41.800 --> 02:33:42.900
Why let it strike?

2784
02:33:42.900 --> 02:33:44.900
Because that like a jackthou keepest the stroke

2785
02:33:44.900 --> 02:33:47.270
between thy begging and mymeditation.

2786
02:33:47.270 --> 02:33:49.170
I am not in the givingvein today.

2787
02:33:50.530 --> 02:33:52.630
May it please you toresolve me my suit.

2788
02:33:52.630 --> 02:33:54.330
Thou troublest me.

2789
02:33:55.470 --> 02:33:57.700
I am not in the vein.

2790
02:34:21.470 --> 02:34:22.730
And is it thus?

2791
02:34:25.570 --> 02:34:31.070
Repays he my deep service

2792
02:34:31.070 --> 02:34:33.370
with such contempt?

2793
02:34:35.470 --> 02:34:38.200
Made I him king for this?

2794
02:34:41.430 --> 02:34:44.200
O, let me think onHastings and be gone

2795
02:34:44.200 --> 02:34:48.070
to Brecknock while myfearful head is on.

2796
02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:07.330
The tyrannous and bloodyact is done,

2797
02:35:07.330 --> 02:35:09.870
the most arch deed ofpiteous massacre

2798
02:35:09.870 --> 02:35:12.230
that ever yet this landwas guilty of.

2799
02:35:20.830 --> 02:35:22.870
Dighton and Forrest,

2800
02:35:22.870 --> 02:35:27.000
who I did suborn to do thispiece of ruthless butchery,

2801
02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:30.900
albeit they were fleshedvillains, bloody dogs,

2802
02:35:30.900 --> 02:35:33.630
melted with tenderness andmild compassion,

2803
02:35:33.630 --> 02:35:37.330
wept like two children intheir deaths' sad story.

2804
02:35:40.470 --> 02:35:45.030
"Oh, thus" quoth Dighton,"lay the gentle babes."

2805
02:35:45.030 --> 02:35:47.400
"Thus, thus," quothForrest,

2806
02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:51.730
"girdling one anotherwithin their alabaster,innocent arms.

2807
02:35:51.730 --> 02:35:54.730
"Their lips were four redroses on a stalk

2808
02:35:54.730 --> 02:35:57.930
"and in their summerbeauty, kissed each other.

2809
02:35:57.930 --> 02:36:01.270
"A book of prayers ontheir pillow lay,

2810
02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:03.830
"which once," quoth Forrest,"almost changed my mind,

2811
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:05.200
but O! The devil!"

2812
02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:15.470
There the villain stoppedwhen Dighton thus told on:

2813
02:36:15.470 --> 02:36:20.170
"We smothered the mostreplenished sweet workof nature

2814
02:36:20.170 --> 02:36:23.800
that from the primecreation e'er she framed."

2815
02:36:26.930 --> 02:36:28.770
Hence both are gone...

2816
02:36:29.830 --> 02:36:32.800
with conscience andremorse.

2817
02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:35.470
They could not speak.

2818
02:36:35.470 --> 02:36:37.000
And so I left them both

2819
02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:40.070
to bear this tidings tothe bloody king.

2820
02:36:41.070 --> 02:36:42.970
And here he comes.

2821
02:36:46.300 --> 02:36:48.170
All health, my sovereignlord.

2822
02:36:48.170 --> 02:36:50.800
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy inthy news?

2823
02:36:52.730 --> 02:36:54.930
If to have done the thingyou gave in charge

2824
02:36:54.930 --> 02:36:56.770
beget your happiness,

2825
02:36:56.770 --> 02:36:59.570
be happy then, for it isdone.

2826
02:36:59.570 --> 02:37:01.700
But didst thou see themdead?

2827
02:37:01.700 --> 02:37:03.230
I did, my lord.

2828
02:37:03.230 --> 02:37:05.230
And buried, gentle Tyrrel?

2829
02:37:05.230 --> 02:37:06.670
The chaplain of the Towerhath buried them,

2830
02:37:06.670 --> 02:37:08.530
but where, to say thetruth, I do not know.

2831
02:37:09.630 --> 02:37:11.370
Come to me, Tyrrel, soonat after supper,

2832
02:37:11.370 --> 02:37:13.830
when thou shalt tell theprocess of their death.

2833
02:37:13.830 --> 02:37:16.000
Meantime, but think how Imay do thee good

2834
02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:17.970
and be inheritor of thydesire.

2835
02:37:17.970 --> 02:37:19.000
Farewell till then.

2836
02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:20.900
I humbly take my leave.

2837
02:37:24.130 --> 02:37:26.430
The son of Clarence have Ipent up close.

2838
02:37:26.430 --> 02:37:28.770
His daughter meanly have Imatched in marriage.

2839
02:37:28.770 --> 02:37:31.200
The sons of Edward sleepin Abraham's bosom,

2840
02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:34.230
and Anne my wife hath bidthis world good night.

2841
02:37:34.230 --> 02:37:36.730
Now, for I know the BretonRichmond

2842
02:37:36.730 --> 02:37:39.070
aims at young Elizabeth,my brother's daughter,

2843
02:37:39.070 --> 02:37:41.870
and by that knot looksproudly on the crown,

2844
02:37:41.870 --> 02:37:44.370
to her go I, a jollythriving wooer.

2845
02:37:44.370 --> 02:37:45.430
My lord?

2846
02:37:45.430 --> 02:37:47.670
Good or bad news, thatthou comest in so bluntly?

2847
02:37:47.670 --> 02:37:49.230
Bad news, my lord.

2848
02:37:49.230 --> 02:37:50.600
Ely is fled to Richmond,

2849
02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:52.770
and Buckingham, backedwith the hardy Welshmen,

2850
02:37:52.770 --> 02:37:55.130
is in the field, and stillhis power increaseth.

2851
02:37:55.130 --> 02:37:57.930
Ely with Richmond troublesme more near

2852
02:37:57.930 --> 02:38:00.700
than Buckingham and hisrash-levied strength.

2853
02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:03.230
Come, I have learned thatfearful commenting

2854
02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:04.930
is leaden servitor to dulldelay.

2855
02:38:04.930 --> 02:38:05.930
Go, muster men.

2856
02:38:05.930 --> 02:38:07.770
My counsel is my shield.

2857
02:38:07.770 --> 02:38:10.800
We must be brief whentraitors brave the field.

2858
02:38:18.430 --> 02:38:22.770
So now prosperity beginsto mellow

2859
02:38:22.770 --> 02:38:27.330
and drop into the rottenmouth of death.

2860
02:38:27.330 --> 02:38:31.700
Here in these confines,slyly have I lurked

2861
02:38:31.700 --> 02:38:34.630
to watch the waning ofmine enemies.

2862
02:38:36.130 --> 02:38:39.730
O, a dire induction am Iwitness to

2863
02:38:39.730 --> 02:38:42.000
and will to France,

2864
02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.870
hoping the consequencewill prove

2865
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:47.900
as bitter, black, andtragical.

2866
02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:53.170
Withdraw thee, wretchedMargaret.

2867
02:38:53.170 --> 02:38:54.570
Who comes here?

2868
02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:02.800
Ah, my poor princes.

2869
02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:08.000
Ah, my tender babes,

2870
02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:12.570
my unblown flowers,new-appearing sweets.

2871
02:39:13.930 --> 02:39:16.270
If yet your gentle soulsfly in the air

2872
02:39:16.270 --> 02:39:19.070
and be not fixed in doomperpetual,

2873
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:21.230
hover about me with yourairy wings

2874
02:39:21.230 --> 02:39:24.070
and hear your mother'slamentation.

2875
02:39:24.070 --> 02:39:26.330
Hover about her.

2876
02:39:26.330 --> 02:39:28.070
Say that right for right

2877
02:39:28.070 --> 02:39:32.100
hath dimmed your infantmorn to aged night.

2878
02:39:32.100 --> 02:39:35.700
So many miseries havecrazed my voice

2879
02:39:35.700 --> 02:39:40.230
that my woe-wearied tongueis still and mute.

2880
02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:44.100
Edward Plantagenet, whyart thou dead?

2881
02:39:44.100 --> 02:39:47.700
Plantagenet doth quitPlantagenet.

2882
02:39:47.700 --> 02:39:51.900
Edward for Edward pays adying debt.

2883
02:39:51.900 --> 02:39:54.700
Wilt thou, O God, fly fromsuch gentle lambs

2884
02:39:54.700 --> 02:39:57.500
and throw them in theentrails of the wolf?

2885
02:39:57.500 --> 02:40:00.770
When didst thou sleep whensuch a deed was done?

2886
02:40:00.770 --> 02:40:05.670
When holy Harry died andmy sweet son.

2887
02:40:07.630 --> 02:40:13.130
Dead life, blind sight,

2888
02:40:13.130 --> 02:40:17.000
poor mortal living ghost.

2889
02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:22.630
Woe's scene, world'sshame,

2890
02:40:22.630 --> 02:40:27.570
grave's due by lifeusurped,

2891
02:40:27.570 --> 02:40:31.970
brief abstract and recordof tedious days,

2892
02:40:31.970 --> 02:40:36.600
rest thy unrest onEngland's lawful earth,

2893
02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:40.770
unlawfully made drunk withinnocent blood.

2894
02:40:40.770 --> 02:40:42.900
Ah, that thou wouldst assoon afford a grave

2895
02:40:42.900 --> 02:40:44.870
as thou canst yield amelancholy seat.

2896
02:40:44.870 --> 02:40:48.700
Then would I hide mybones, not rest them here.

2897
02:40:48.700 --> 02:40:51.900
O, who hath any cause tomourn but we?

2898
02:40:51.900 --> 02:40:54.670
If ancient sorrow be mostreverend,

2899
02:40:54.670 --> 02:40:57.830
give mine the benefit ofseniory

2900
02:40:57.830 --> 02:41:02.030
and let my griefs frown onthe upper hand.

2901
02:41:03.430 --> 02:41:08.270
If sorrow can admitsociety,

2902
02:41:08.270 --> 02:41:12.900
tell o'er your woes againby viewing mine.

2903
02:41:14.970 --> 02:41:19.970
I had an Edward till aRichard killed him.

2904
02:41:19.970 --> 02:41:24.070
I had a husband till aRichard killed him.

2905
02:41:24.070 --> 02:41:27.800
Thou hadst an Edward tilla Richard killed him.

2906
02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:30.700
Thou hadst a Richard tilla Richard killed him.

2907
02:41:30.700 --> 02:41:34.800
I had a Richard too, andthou didst kill him.

2908
02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:39.100
I had a Rutland too; thouholp'st to kill him.

2909
02:41:39.100 --> 02:41:43.900
Thou hadst a Clarence too,and Richard killed him.

2910
02:41:43.900 --> 02:41:47.670
From forth the kennel ofthy womb

2911
02:41:47.670 --> 02:41:52.900
hath crept a hell-hound thatdoth hunt us all to death.

2912
02:41:52.900 --> 02:41:57.200
That dog that had histeeth before his eyes

2913
02:41:57.200 --> 02:42:00.100
to worry lambs and laptheir gentle blood,

2914
02:42:00.100 --> 02:42:03.400
that excellent grandtyrant of the earth

2915
02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:07.900
that reigns in galled eyesof weeping souls,

2916
02:42:07.900 --> 02:42:11.200
that foul defacer of God'shandiwork

2917
02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:16.600
thy womb let loose tochase us to our graves.

2918
02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:21.970
O upright, just, andtrue-disposing God,

2919
02:42:21.970 --> 02:42:26.300
how do I thank thee thatthis carnal cur

2920
02:42:26.300 --> 02:42:29.070
preys on the issue of hismother's body

2921
02:42:29.070 --> 02:42:32.200
and makes her pew fellowwith others' moan.

2922
02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:36.100
O Harry's wife, triumphnot in my woes.

2923
02:42:36.100 --> 02:42:38.700
God witness with me; Ihave wept for thine.

2924
02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:40.170
Bear with me.

2925
02:42:40.170 --> 02:42:43.730
I am hungry for revenge,

2926
02:42:43.730 --> 02:42:48.300
and now I cloy me withbeholding it.

2927
02:42:51.130 --> 02:42:56.370
Thy Edward, he is dead,that killed my Edward,

2928
02:42:56.370 --> 02:43:01.000
thy other Edward dead toquit my Edward.

2929
02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.500
Young York, he is butboot,

2930
02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:08.430
because both they matchnot the high perfection ofmy loss.

2931
02:43:08.430 --> 02:43:13.670
Thy Clarence, he is dead,that stabbed my Edward.

2932
02:43:13.670 --> 02:43:16.300
And to the beholders ofthat frantic play,

2933
02:43:16.300 --> 02:43:20.570
the adulterate Hastings,Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,

2934
02:43:20.570 --> 02:43:24.470
untimely smothered intheir dusky graves.

2935
02:43:24.470 --> 02:43:27.900
Richard yet lives.

2936
02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:30.530
Hell's black intelligencer

2937
02:43:30.530 --> 02:43:32.270
only reserved their factor

2938
02:43:32.270 --> 02:43:34.570
to buy souls and send themthither.

2939
02:43:34.570 --> 02:43:36.330
But at hand,

2940
02:43:36.330 --> 02:43:42.600
at hand ensues his piteousand unpitied end.

2941
02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:48.370
Earth gapes, hell burns,fiends roar, saints pray

2942
02:43:48.370 --> 02:43:51.330
to have him suddenlyconveyed from hence.

2943
02:43:51.330 --> 02:43:55.400
Cancel his bond of life,dear God, I pray,

2944
02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:59.070
that I may live and saythe dog is dead!

2945
02:43:59.070 --> 02:44:01.330
O, thou didst prophesy thetime would come

2946
02:44:01.330 --> 02:44:03.170
that I should wish forthee to help me curse

2947
02:44:03.170 --> 02:44:06.930
that bottled spider, thatfoul, bunch-backed toad.

2948
02:44:06.930 --> 02:44:12.500
I called thee then vainflourish of my fortune.

2949
02:44:12.500 --> 02:44:18.370
I called thee then poorshadow, painted queen,

2950
02:44:18.370 --> 02:44:20.800
the presentation of butwhat I was,

2951
02:44:20.800 --> 02:44:24.100
the flattering index of adireful pageant,

2952
02:44:24.100 --> 02:44:27.230
one heaved ahigh to behurled down below,

2953
02:44:27.230 --> 02:44:30.300
a mother only mocked withtwo fair babes,

2954
02:44:30.300 --> 02:44:33.130
a dream of what thou wast,

2955
02:44:33.130 --> 02:44:37.530
a garish flag to be the aimof every dangerous shot,

2956
02:44:37.530 --> 02:44:43.230
a queen in jest, only tofill the scene.

2957
02:44:43.230 --> 02:44:47.030
Where is thy husband now?

2958
02:44:47.030 --> 02:44:51.000
Where be thy brothers?

2959
02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:54.130
Where are thy two sons?

2960
02:44:54.130 --> 02:44:57.370
Wherein dost thou joy?

2961
02:44:58.930 --> 02:45:01.500
Who sues and kneels andsays "God save the queen"?

2962
02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:04.000
Where be the bending peersthat flattered thee?

2963
02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:07.230
Where be the throngingtroops that followed thee?

2964
02:45:07.230 --> 02:45:12.830
Decline all this, and seewhat now thou art.

2965
02:45:12.830 --> 02:45:17.000
For happy wife, a mostdistressed widow.

2966
02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:21.170
For joyful mother, onethat wails the name.

2967
02:45:21.170 --> 02:45:26.800
For one being sued to, onethat humbly sues.

2968
02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:33.330
For queen, a very caitivecrowned with care.

2969
02:45:33.330 --> 02:45:41.400
For she that scorned at menow scorned of me.

2970
02:45:41.400 --> 02:45:47.330
For she being feared ofall now fearing one.

2971
02:45:47.330 --> 02:45:53.300
For she commanding all,obeyed of none.

2972
02:45:54.830 --> 02:45:58.270
Thus hath the course ofjustice whirled about

2973
02:45:58.270 --> 02:46:02.430
and left thee but a veryprey to time,

2974
02:46:02.430 --> 02:46:05.000
having no more but thoughtof what thou wast

2975
02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:08.070
to torture thee the more,being what thou art.

2976
02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:14.300
Thou didst usurp my place.

2977
02:46:14.300 --> 02:46:18.470
Dost thou not usurp the justproportion of my sorrow?

2978
02:46:20.670 --> 02:46:27.670
Now thy proud neck bearshalf my burdened yoke

2979
02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:34.900
from which even here Islip my wearied head

2980
02:46:34.900 --> 02:46:40.800
and leave the burden of itall on thee.

2981
02:46:47.430 --> 02:46:53.600
Farewell, York's wife

2982
02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:56.300
and queen of sadmischance.

2983
02:46:57.970 --> 02:47:02.730
O, these English woes shallmake me smile in France.

2984
02:47:02.730 --> 02:47:05.870
O, thou well-skilled incurses, stay awhile,

2985
02:47:05.870 --> 02:47:08.570
and teach me how to cursemine enemies.

2986
02:47:12.100 --> 02:47:16.730
Forbear to sleep thenights and fast the days.

2987
02:47:16.730 --> 02:47:19.570
Compare dead happinesswith living woe.

2988
02:47:20.970 --> 02:47:24.670
Think that thy babes weresweeter than they were

2989
02:47:24.670 --> 02:47:28.370
and he that slew themfouler than he is.

2990
02:47:28.370 --> 02:47:32.670
Bettering thy loss willmake the bad causer worse.

2991
02:47:32.670 --> 02:47:35.470
Revolving this will teachthee how to curse.

2992
02:47:35.470 --> 02:47:36.630
My words are dull!

2993
02:47:36.630 --> 02:47:38.170
O, quicken them withthine.

2994
02:47:38.170 --> 02:47:44.170
Thy woes will make themsharp and pierce like mine.

2995
02:47:55.430 --> 02:47:59.130
Why should calamity befull of words?

2996
02:48:01.330 --> 02:48:05.030
Windy attorneys to theirclients' woes,

2997
02:48:05.030 --> 02:48:07.430
poor breathing orators ofmiseries,

2998
02:48:07.430 --> 02:48:09.530
let them have scope.

2999
02:48:09.530 --> 02:48:11.530
Though what they willimpart help nothing else,

3000
02:48:11.530 --> 02:48:13.900
yet do they ease theheart.

3001
02:48:15.630 --> 02:48:20.470
If so, then be nottongue-tied.

3002
02:48:20.470 --> 02:48:21.770
Go with me,

3003
02:48:21.770 --> 02:48:24.200
and in the breath ofbitter words,

3004
02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:26.700
let's smother my damnedson

3005
02:48:26.700 --> 02:48:29.170
that thy two sweet sonssmothered.

3006
02:48:30.530 --> 02:48:31.970
The trumpet sounds.

3007
02:48:31.970 --> 02:48:34.170
Be copious in exclaims.

3008
02:48:45.630 --> 02:48:48.130
Who intercepts me in myexpedition?

3009
02:48:48.130 --> 02:48:50.800
O, she that might haveintercepted thee

3010
02:48:50.800 --> 02:48:52.730
by strangling thee in heraccursed womb

3011
02:48:52.730 --> 02:48:55.800
from all the slaughters,wretch, that thou hast done.

3012
02:48:55.800 --> 02:48:58.770
Tell me, thou villain slave,where are my children?

3013
02:48:58.770 --> 02:49:02.570
Thou toad, thou toad,where is thy brotherClarence

3014
02:49:02.570 --> 02:49:04.770
and little NedPlantagenet, his son?

3015
02:49:04.770 --> 02:49:06.930
Where is the gentleRivers, Vaughan, Grey?

3016
02:49:06.930 --> 02:49:08.300
Where is kind Hastings?

3017
02:49:08.300 --> 02:49:09.670
A flourish, trumpets!

3018
02:49:09.670 --> 02:49:11.230
Strike alarum, drums!

3019
02:49:11.230 --> 02:49:13.370
Let not the heavens hearthese tell-tale women

3020
02:49:13.370 --> 02:49:15.330
rail on the Lord'sanointed.

3021
02:49:15.330 --> 02:49:16.630
Strike, I say!

3022
02:49:24.500 --> 02:49:27.570
Either be patient andentreat me fair,

3023
02:49:27.570 --> 02:49:29.870
or with the clamorousreport of war,

3024
02:49:29.870 --> 02:49:32.630
thus will I drown yourexclamations.

3025
02:49:33.900 --> 02:49:35.900
Art thou my son?

3026
02:49:35.900 --> 02:49:38.900
Aye, I thank God, myfather, and yourself.

3027
02:49:38.900 --> 02:49:41.930
Then patiently hear myimpatience.

3028
02:49:41.930 --> 02:49:43.770
Madam, I have a touch ofyour condition

3029
02:49:43.770 --> 02:49:45.570
that cannot brook theaccent of reproof.

3030
02:49:45.570 --> 02:49:46.570
O, let me speak.

3031
02:49:46.570 --> 02:49:47.630
Do then, but I'll nothear.

3032
02:49:47.630 --> 02:49:50.470
I will be mild and gentlein my words.

3033
02:49:50.470 --> 02:49:52.400
And brief, good mother,for I am in haste.

3034
02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:55.070
Art thou so hasty?

3035
02:49:55.070 --> 02:49:58.230
I have stayed for thee,God knows,

3036
02:49:58.230 --> 02:49:59.970
in torment and in agony.

3037
02:49:59.970 --> 02:50:02.370
And came I not at last tocomfort you?

3038
02:50:02.370 --> 02:50:07.230
No, by the holy rood, thouknow'st it well.

3039
02:50:07.230 --> 02:50:11.870
Thou camest on earth tomake the earth my Hell.

3040
02:50:11.870 --> 02:50:15.570
A grievous burden was thybirth to me.

3041
02:50:15.570 --> 02:50:18.330
Tetchy and wayward was thyinfancy,

3042
02:50:18.330 --> 02:50:22.270
thy schooldays frightful,desperate, wild, and furious,

3043
02:50:22.270 --> 02:50:26.730
thy prime of manhood daring,bold, and venturous,

3044
02:50:26.730 --> 02:50:32.730
thy age confirmed, proud,subtle, sly, and bloody,

3045
02:50:32.730 --> 02:50:36.400
more mild but yet moreharmful, kind in hatred.

3046
02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:38.330
If I be so disgracious inyour eye,

3047
02:50:38.330 --> 02:50:40.030
let me march on and notoffend you, madam.

3048
02:50:40.030 --> 02:50:41.030
Strike up the drum!

3049
02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:42.030
I prithee, hear me speak.

3050
02:50:42.030 --> 02:50:43.030
You speak too bitterly.

3051
02:50:43.030 --> 02:50:44.130
Hear me a word,

3052
02:50:44.130 --> 02:50:46.170
for I shall never speak tothee again.

3053
02:50:50.930 --> 02:50:53.200
So.

3054
02:50:53.200 --> 02:50:57.570
Either thou wilt die byGod's just ordinance,

3055
02:50:57.570 --> 02:50:59.830
ere from this war thouturn a conqueror,

3056
02:50:59.830 --> 02:51:02.630
or I with grief andextreme age shall perish

3057
02:51:02.630 --> 02:51:04.700
and nevermore behold thyface again.

3058
02:51:06.030 --> 02:51:10.500
Therefore, take with theemy most grievous curse,

3059
02:51:10.500 --> 02:51:13.670
which in the day ofbattle, tire thee more

3060
02:51:13.670 --> 02:51:16.670
than all the completearmor that thou wearest.

3061
02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:21.930
My prayers on the adverseparty fight.

3062
02:51:21.930 --> 02:51:24.430
And there the little soulsof Edward's children

3063
02:51:24.430 --> 02:51:26.400
whisper the spirits ofthine enemies

3064
02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:29.600
and promise them successand victory.

3065
02:51:30.870 --> 02:51:33.800
Bloody thou art; bloodywill be thy end.

3066
02:51:33.800 --> 02:51:38.970
Shame serves thy life anddoth thy death attend.

3067
02:51:40.830 --> 02:51:42.270
Though far more cause,

3068
02:51:42.270 --> 02:51:44.400
yet much less spirit tocurse abides in me.

3069
02:51:44.400 --> 02:51:46.700
I say amen to her.

3070
02:51:48.800 --> 02:51:50.000
Stay, madam.

3071
02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
I must talk a word withyou.

3072
02:51:56.330 --> 02:52:00.530
I have no more sons of theroyal blood for thee toslaughter.

3073
02:52:00.530 --> 02:52:01.800
For my daughters, Richard,

3074
02:52:01.800 --> 02:52:04.070
they shall be prayingnuns, not weeping queens,

3075
02:52:04.070 --> 02:52:05.770
and therefore level not tohit their lives.

3076
02:52:05.770 --> 02:52:07.400
You have a daughter calledElizabeth,

3077
02:52:07.400 --> 02:52:09.430
virtuous and fair, royaland gracious.

3078
02:52:09.430 --> 02:52:10.530
And must she die for this?

3079
02:52:10.530 --> 02:52:12.000
O, let her live,

3080
02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.270
and I'll corrupt hermanners, stain her beauty,

3081
02:52:14.270 --> 02:52:16.130
slander myself as false toEdward's bed,

3082
02:52:16.130 --> 02:52:18.270
throw over her the veil ofinfamy.

3083
02:52:18.270 --> 02:52:20.400
So she may live unscarredof bleeding slaughter,

3084
02:52:20.400 --> 02:52:22.370
I will confess she was notEdward's daughter.

3085
02:52:22.370 --> 02:52:24.500
Wrong not her birth; sheis a royal princess.

3086
02:52:24.500 --> 02:52:26.400
To save her life, I'll sayshe is not so.

3087
02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:28.230
Her life is safest only inher birth.

3088
02:52:28.230 --> 02:52:30.970
And only in that safetydied her brothers.

3089
02:52:30.970 --> 02:52:33.270
Lo, at their birth, goodstars were opposite.

3090
02:52:33.270 --> 02:52:35.370
No, to their lives illfriends were contrary.

3091
02:52:35.370 --> 02:52:37.230
All unavoided is the doomof destiny.

3092
02:52:37.230 --> 02:52:39.700
True, when avoided gracemakes destiny.

3093
02:52:39.700 --> 02:52:42.000
My babes were destined toa fairer death

3094
02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:43.900
if grace had blessed theewith a fairer life.

3095
02:52:43.900 --> 02:52:46.300
You speak as if that I hadslain my cousins.

3096
02:52:46.300 --> 02:52:48.630
Cousins, indeed, and bytheir uncle,

3097
02:52:48.630 --> 02:52:53.300
cozened of comfort, kingdom,kindred, freedom, life!

3098
02:52:53.300 --> 02:52:55.430
Whose hand soever lancedtheir tender hearts,

3099
02:52:55.430 --> 02:52:58.570
thy head, all indirectly,gave direction.

3100
02:52:58.570 --> 02:53:00.700
No doubt the murderousknife was dull and blunt

3101
02:53:00.700 --> 02:53:03.330
till it was whetted on thystone-hard heart

3102
02:53:03.330 --> 02:53:06.500
to revel in the entrailsof my lambs.

3103
02:53:06.500 --> 02:53:09.570
But that still use of griefmakes wild grief tame,

3104
02:53:09.570 --> 02:53:12.100
my tongue should to thineears not name my boys

3105
02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:14.970
till that my nails wereanchored in thine eyes.

3106
02:53:14.970 --> 02:53:17.330
And I, in such a desperatebay of death,

3107
02:53:17.330 --> 02:53:19.970
like a poor bark of sailsand tackling reft,

3108
02:53:19.970 --> 02:53:22.570
rush all to pieces on thyrocky bosom.

3109
02:53:22.570 --> 02:53:25.270
Madam, so thrive I in myenterprise

3110
02:53:25.270 --> 02:53:27.330
and dangerous success ofbloody wars

3111
02:53:27.330 --> 02:53:29.730
as I intend more good toyou and yours

3112
02:53:29.730 --> 02:53:31.370
than ever you or yours byme were harmed.

3113
02:53:32.670 --> 02:53:34.870
What good is covered withthe face of Heaven

3114
02:53:34.870 --> 02:53:37.200
to be discovered that cando me good?

3115
02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:39.300
The advancement of yourchildren, gentle lady.

3116
02:53:39.300 --> 02:53:41.230
Up to some scaffold, thereto lose their heads?

3117
02:53:41.230 --> 02:53:43.130
Unto the dignity andheight of fortune,

3118
02:53:43.130 --> 02:53:45.800
the high imperial type ofthis earth's glory.

3119
02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:47.770
Flatter my sorrow withreport of it.

3120
02:53:47.770 --> 02:53:50.230
Tell me, what state, whathonor, what dignity

3121
02:53:50.230 --> 02:53:52.030
canst thou demise to anychild of mine?

3122
02:53:52.030 --> 02:53:53.400
Even all I have.

3123
02:53:53.400 --> 02:53:55.800
Aye, and myself and all

3124
02:53:55.800 --> 02:53:58.300
will I withal endow achild of thine

3125
02:53:58.300 --> 02:54:00.230
so in the lethe of thyangry soul,

3126
02:54:00.230 --> 02:54:02.370
thou drown the sadremembrance of those wrongs

3127
02:54:02.370 --> 02:54:04.570
which thou supposest Ihave done to thee.

3128
02:54:04.570 --> 02:54:07.270
Be brief, lest that theprocess of thy kindness

3129
02:54:07.270 --> 02:54:09.430
last longer telling thanthy kindness' date.

3130
02:54:09.430 --> 02:54:12.170
Then know that from mysoul, I love thy daughter.

3131
02:54:12.170 --> 02:54:14.030
My daughter's motherthinks it with her soul.

3132
02:54:14.030 --> 02:54:15.070
What do you think?

3133
02:54:15.070 --> 02:54:17.800
That thou dost love mydaughter from thy soul.

3134
02:54:17.800 --> 02:54:21.130
So from thy soul's love didstthou love her brothers,

3135
02:54:21.130 --> 02:54:23.800
and from my heart's love,I do thank thee for it.

3136
02:54:23.800 --> 02:54:25.770
Be not so hasty toconfound my meaning.

3137
02:54:25.770 --> 02:54:28.030
I mean that with my soul,I love thy daughter

3138
02:54:28.030 --> 02:54:30.730
and do intend to make herqueen of England.

3139
02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:35.600
Well, then, who dost thoumean shall be her king?

3140
02:54:35.600 --> 02:54:37.900
Even he that makes herqueen; who else should be?

3141
02:54:37.900 --> 02:54:38.900
What, thou?

3142
02:54:38.900 --> 02:54:40.570
Even so. How think you ofit?

3143
02:54:40.570 --> 02:54:41.870
How canst thou woo her?

3144
02:54:41.870 --> 02:54:42.970
That would I learn of you,

3145
02:54:42.970 --> 02:54:45.130
as one being bestacquainted with her humor.

3146
02:54:45.130 --> 02:54:46.700
And wilt thou learn of me?

3147
02:54:46.700 --> 02:54:48.870
Madam, with all my heart.

3148
02:54:56.400 --> 02:55:01.330
Send to her by the manthat slew her brothers

3149
02:55:01.330 --> 02:55:04.400
a pair of bleeding hearts.

3150
02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:07.770
Thereon engrave Edward andYork.

3151
02:55:07.770 --> 02:55:10.370
Then haply will she weep.

3152
02:55:10.370 --> 02:55:13.100
Therefore present to her--

3153
02:55:13.100 --> 02:55:15.230
as sometimes Margaret didto thy father,

3154
02:55:15.230 --> 02:55:16.730
steeped in Rutland'sblood--

3155
02:55:16.730 --> 02:55:19.670
a handkerchief, which, sayto her,

3156
02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:24.030
did drain the purple sap fromher sweet brother's body,

3157
02:55:24.030 --> 02:55:27.270
and bid her wipe herweeping eyes withal.

3158
02:55:27.270 --> 02:55:29.730
If this inducement moveher not to love,

3159
02:55:29.730 --> 02:55:32.430
send her a letter of thynoble deed.

3160
02:55:32.430 --> 02:55:33.970
Tell her thou madest away

3161
02:55:33.970 --> 02:55:36.300
her uncle Clarence, heruncle Rivers,

3162
02:55:36.300 --> 02:55:37.700
aye, and, for her sake,

3163
02:55:37.700 --> 02:55:39.930
mad'st quick conveyancewith her good aunt Anne.

3164
02:55:39.930 --> 02:55:40.930
You mock me, madam?

3165
02:55:40.930 --> 02:55:43.000
This is not the way to winyour daughter.

3166
02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:44.030
There is no other way,

3167
02:55:44.030 --> 02:55:45.270
unless thou couldst put onsome other shape

3168
02:55:45.270 --> 02:55:47.170
and not be Richard thathath done all this.

3169
02:55:47.170 --> 02:55:49.370
Say that I did all thisfor love of her.

3170
02:55:49.370 --> 02:55:51.670
Nay, then indeed she cannotchoose but hate thee,

3171
02:55:51.670 --> 02:55:54.230
having bought love withsuch a bloody spoil!

3172
02:55:54.230 --> 02:55:56.800
Look, what is done cannotbe now amended!

3173
02:55:56.800 --> 02:55:58.800
Men shall deal unadvisedlysometimes,

3174
02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:01.400
which after hours, givesleisure to repent.

3175
02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:03.600
If I did take the kingdomfrom your sons,

3176
02:56:03.600 --> 02:56:05.670
to make amends, I'll giveit to your daughter.

3177
02:56:05.670 --> 02:56:08.130
If I have killed the issueof your womb,

3178
02:56:08.130 --> 02:56:09.330
to quicken your increase,

3179
02:56:09.330 --> 02:56:12.670
I will beget mine issue ofyour blood upon your daughter.

3180
02:56:12.670 --> 02:56:14.670
A grandam's name is littleless in love

3181
02:56:14.670 --> 02:56:16.870
than is the doting titleof a mother.

3182
02:56:16.870 --> 02:56:19.770
They are as children butone step below,

3183
02:56:19.770 --> 02:56:22.030
even of your mettle, ofyour very blood.

3184
02:56:22.030 --> 02:56:25.530
Of all one pain, save fora night of groans enduredof her,

3185
02:56:25.530 --> 02:56:27.470
for whom you bid likesorrow.

3186
02:56:27.470 --> 02:56:29.630
Your children werevexation to your youth,

3187
02:56:29.630 --> 02:56:32.000
but mine shall be acomfort to your age.

3188
02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.500
The loss you have is but ason being king,

3189
02:56:34.500 --> 02:56:38.000
and by that loss, yourdaughter is made queen.

3190
02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.100
I cannot make you whatamends I would.

3191
02:56:40.100 --> 02:56:43.000
Therefore, accept suchkindness as I can.

3192
02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.600
Dorset, your son, thatwith a fearful soul

3193
02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:48.000
leads discontented stepsin foreign soil,

3194
02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.370
this fair alliance quicklyshall call home

3195
02:56:50.370 --> 02:56:52.630
to high promotions andgreat dignity.

3196
02:56:52.630 --> 02:56:55.100
The king, that calls yourbeauteous daughter wife,

3197
02:56:55.100 --> 02:56:58.030
familiarly shall call thyDorset brother.

3198
02:56:58.030 --> 02:56:59.970
Again shall you be motherto a king

3199
02:56:59.970 --> 02:57:03.030
and all the ruins ofdistressful times repaired

3200
02:57:03.030 --> 02:57:05.370
with doubled riches ofcontent.

3201
02:57:05.370 --> 02:57:06.370
What?

3202
02:57:06.370 --> 02:57:09.170
We have many goodly daysto see.

3203
02:57:09.170 --> 02:57:11.230
The liquid drops of tearsthat you have shed

3204
02:57:11.230 --> 02:57:14.370
shall come again,transformed to Orient pearl,

3205
02:57:14.370 --> 02:57:16.630
advantaging their loanwith interest

3206
02:57:16.630 --> 02:57:19.570
of ten times double gainof happiness.

3207
02:57:19.570 --> 02:57:21.200
Go then, my mother.

3208
02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:22.800
To thy daughter go.

3209
02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:26.230
Make bold her bashful yearswith your experience.

3210
02:57:26.230 --> 02:57:29.000
Prepare her ears to hear awooer's tale

3211
02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:30.900
put in her tender heart

3212
02:57:30.900 --> 02:57:33.930
the aspiring flame ofgolden sovereignty.

3213
02:57:33.930 --> 02:57:35.400
Acquaint the princess

3214
02:57:35.400 --> 02:57:38.200
with the sweet silenthours of marriage joys,

3215
02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:41.900
and when this arm of mine hathchastised the petty rebel,

3216
02:57:41.900 --> 02:57:43.630
dull-brained Buckingham,

3217
02:57:43.630 --> 02:57:45.870
bound with triumphantgarlands will I come

3218
02:57:45.870 --> 02:57:48.670
and lead thy daughter to aconqueror's bed,

3219
02:57:48.670 --> 02:57:50.770
to whom I will retail myconquest won,

3220
02:57:50.770 --> 02:57:55.170
and she shall be solevictress, Caesar's Caesar.

3221
02:57:57.070 --> 02:58:00.200
What were I best to say?

3222
02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:03.600
Her father's brother wouldbe her lord?

3223
02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:06.200
Or shall I say her uncle?

3224
02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:09.500
Or he that slew herbrothers and her uncles?

3225
02:58:09.500 --> 02:58:11.670
Under what title shall Iwoo for thee

3226
02:58:11.670 --> 02:58:13.630
that God, the law, myhonor, and her love,

3227
02:58:13.630 --> 02:58:16.070
can make seem pleasing toher tender years?

3228
02:58:16.070 --> 02:58:18.430
Infer fair England's peaceby this alliance.

3229
02:58:18.430 --> 02:58:20.400
Which she shall purchasewith still-lasting war.

3230
02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:22.370
Tell her the king that maycommand entreats.

3231
02:58:22.370 --> 02:58:24.900
That at her hands whichthe king's king forbids.

3232
02:58:24.900 --> 02:58:27.200
Say she shall be a highand mighty queen.

3233
02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:29.270
To veil a title, as hermother doth.

3234
02:58:29.270 --> 02:58:30.870
Say I will love hereverlastingly.

3235
02:58:30.870 --> 02:58:32.870
But how long shall thattitle "ever" last?

3236
02:58:32.870 --> 02:58:34.470
Sweetly in force unto herfair life's end.

3237
02:58:34.470 --> 02:58:37.030
But how long fairly shallher sweet life last?

3238
02:58:37.030 --> 02:58:38.700
As long as heaven andnature lengthens it.

3239
02:58:38.700 --> 02:58:40.570
As long as Hell andRichard likes of it.

3240
02:58:40.570 --> 02:58:42.670
Say, I, her sovereign, amher subject love.

3241
02:58:42.670 --> 02:58:45.300
But she, your subject,loathes such sovereignty.

3242
02:58:45.300 --> 02:58:46.870
Be eloquent in my behalfto her.

3243
02:58:46.870 --> 02:58:48.930
An honest tale speeds bestbeing plainly told.

3244
02:58:48.930 --> 02:58:51.370
Then plainly to her, tellher my loving tale.

3245
02:58:51.370 --> 02:58:53.500
Plain and not honest istoo harsh a style.

3246
02:58:53.500 --> 02:58:54.900
Your reasons are tooshallow and too quick!

3247
02:58:54.900 --> 02:58:57.700
O no, my reasons are toodeep and dead.

3248
02:58:57.700 --> 02:59:00.870
Too deep and dead, poorinfants, in their grave.

3249
02:59:00.870 --> 02:59:02.200
Harp not on that string,madam.

3250
02:59:02.200 --> 02:59:03.400
That is past.

3251
02:59:03.400 --> 02:59:05.470
Harp on it still shall Itill heartstrings break.

3252
02:59:05.470 --> 02:59:07.800
Now, by my George, mygarter, and my crown--

3253
02:59:07.800 --> 02:59:09.730
Profaned, dishonored, andthe third, usurped.

3254
02:59:09.730 --> 02:59:10.930
I swear--

3255
02:59:10.930 --> 02:59:12.470
By nothing, for this is nooath.

3256
02:59:12.470 --> 02:59:15.270
Thy George, profaned, hathlost his holy honor.

3257
02:59:15.270 --> 02:59:18.170
Thy garter, blemished,pawned his knightly virtue.

3258
02:59:18.170 --> 02:59:21.230
Thy crown, usurped,disgraced his kingly glory.

3259
02:59:21.230 --> 02:59:23.600
If something thou wouldstswear to be believed,

3260
02:59:23.600 --> 02:59:25.900
swear then by somethingthat thou hast not wronged.

3261
02:59:25.900 --> 02:59:26.900
Now, by the world--

3262
02:59:26.900 --> 02:59:28.570
'Tis full of thy foulwrongs.

3263
02:59:28.570 --> 02:59:29.570
My father's death--

3264
02:59:29.570 --> 02:59:30.630
Thy life hath itdishonored.

3265
02:59:30.630 --> 02:59:31.630
Then by myself--

3266
02:59:31.630 --> 02:59:32.630
Thyself is self misused.

3267
02:59:32.630 --> 02:59:33.630
Why, then, by God.

3268
02:59:33.630 --> 02:59:36.000
God's wrong is most ofall!

3269
02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:38.030
If thou didst fear tobreak an oath with God,

3270
02:59:38.030 --> 02:59:39.970
the unity the king myhusband made,

3271
02:59:39.970 --> 02:59:42.600
thou hadst not broken normy brothers died.

3272
02:59:42.600 --> 02:59:44.630
If thou hadst feared tobreak an oath with Him,

3273
02:59:44.630 --> 02:59:47.400
the imperial metalcircling now thy head

3274
02:59:47.400 --> 02:59:50.570
had graced the tendertemples of my child,

3275
02:59:50.570 --> 02:59:53.200
and both the princes hadbeen breathing here,

3276
02:59:53.200 --> 02:59:56.030
which now, two tenderbedfellows for dust,

3277
02:59:56.030 --> 02:59:58.800
thy broken faith hath madethe prey for worms.

3278
02:59:58.800 --> 03:00:00.570
What canst thou swear bynow?

3279
03:00:00.570 --> 03:00:02.270
The time to come.

3280
03:00:02.270 --> 03:00:05.200
That thou hast wronged inthe time o'erpast.

3281
03:00:05.200 --> 03:00:08.300
For I myself have many tearsto wash hereafter time

3282
03:00:08.300 --> 03:00:10.670
for times past wronged bythee.

3283
03:00:10.670 --> 03:00:13.930
The children live whosefathers thou hast slaughtered,

3284
03:00:13.930 --> 03:00:17.070
ungoverned youth, to wailit in their age.

3285
03:00:17.070 --> 03:00:21.370
The parents live whosechildren thou hast butchered,

3286
03:00:21.370 --> 03:00:24.730
old barren plants, to wailit with their age.

3287
03:00:25.900 --> 03:00:27.700
Swear not by time to come,

3288
03:00:27.700 --> 03:00:30.000
for that thou hast misusedere used

3289
03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.570
by times ill usedo'erpast!

3290
03:00:32.570 --> 03:00:34.270
As I intend to prosper andrepent,

3291
03:00:34.270 --> 03:00:37.370
so thrive I in my dangerousaffairs of hostile arms.

3292
03:00:37.370 --> 03:00:39.300
Myself, myself confound.

3293
03:00:39.300 --> 03:00:41.800
God and fortune bar mehappy hours.

3294
03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:44.670
Day, yield me not thylight nor night, thy rest.

3295
03:00:44.670 --> 03:00:47.500
Be opposite, all planets ofgood luck, to my proceeding

3296
03:00:47.500 --> 03:00:50.700
if, with dear heart'slove, immaculate devotion,

3297
03:00:50.700 --> 03:00:54.000
holy thoughts, I tendernot your beauteous,princely daughter.

3298
03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:57.070
In her consists myhappiness and thine.

3299
03:00:57.070 --> 03:01:00.100
Without her, follows tomyself and thee,

3300
03:01:00.100 --> 03:01:03.100
herself, the land, andmany a Christian soul,

3301
03:01:03.100 --> 03:01:06.570
death, desolation, ruin,and decay.

3302
03:01:06.570 --> 03:01:08.900
It cannot be avoided butby this.

3303
03:01:08.900 --> 03:01:11.800
It will not be avoided butby this.

3304
03:01:11.800 --> 03:01:17.600
Therefore, dear mother-- Imust call you so--

3305
03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:21.170
be the attorney of my loveto her.

3306
03:01:21.170 --> 03:01:24.500
Plead what I will be, notwhat I have been.

3307
03:01:24.500 --> 03:01:27.600
Not my deserts, but what Iwill deserve.

3308
03:01:27.600 --> 03:01:30.900
Urge the necessity andstate of times,

3309
03:01:30.900 --> 03:01:34.200
and be not peevish foundin great designs.

3310
03:01:35.870 --> 03:01:39.430
Shall I be tempted of thedevil thus?

3311
03:01:39.430 --> 03:01:42.300
Aye, if the devil temptyou to do good.

3312
03:01:43.630 --> 03:01:47.100
Shall I forget myself tobe myself?

3313
03:01:47.100 --> 03:01:51.400
Aye, if yourself'sremembrance wrong yourself.

3314
03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:53.830
Yet thou didst kill mychildren.

3315
03:01:53.830 --> 03:01:57.830
But in your daughter'swomb, I bury them,

3316
03:01:57.830 --> 03:02:00.670
where, in that nest ofspicery,

3317
03:02:00.670 --> 03:02:02.930
they will breed selves ofthemselves,

3318
03:02:02.930 --> 03:02:04.700
to your recomforture.

3319
03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.830
Shall I go win my daughterto thy will?

3320
03:02:08.830 --> 03:02:11.830
And be a happy mother bythe deed.

3321
03:02:11.830 --> 03:02:14.070
I go.

3322
03:02:14.070 --> 03:02:16.500
Write to me very shortly,

3323
03:02:16.500 --> 03:02:19.270
and you shall understandfrom me her mind.

3324
03:02:22.670 --> 03:02:24.430
Bear her my true love'skiss.

3325
03:02:34.370 --> 03:02:36.100
And so, farewell.

3326
03:02:41.730 --> 03:02:44.530
Relenting fool andshallow, changing woman.

3327
03:02:45.700 --> 03:02:47.130
How now. What news?

3328
03:02:47.130 --> 03:02:48.770
Mighty sovereign, on thewestern coast

3329
03:02:48.770 --> 03:02:50.370
rideth a puissant navy.

3330
03:02:50.370 --> 03:02:53.300
To our shores throng manydoubtful hollow-heartedfriends,

3331
03:02:53.300 --> 03:02:55.470
unarmed and unresolved tobeat them back.

3332
03:02:55.470 --> 03:02:58.300
'Tis thought that Richmondis their admiral.

3333
03:02:58.300 --> 03:03:00.700
And there they hull,expecting but the aid ofBuckingham

3334
03:03:00.700 --> 03:03:02.200
to welcome them ashore.

3335
03:03:02.200 --> 03:03:04.870
Some light-foot friend postto the duke of Norfolk:

3336
03:03:04.870 --> 03:03:07.400
Ratcliffe, thyself, orCatesby.

3337
03:03:07.400 --> 03:03:08.400
Where is he?

3338
03:03:08.400 --> 03:03:09.400
Here, my lord.

3339
03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:10.500
Catesby, fly to the duke.

3340
03:03:10.500 --> 03:03:12.230
I will, my lord, with allconvenient haste.

3341
03:03:12.230 --> 03:03:14.100
Ratcliffe, come hither.

3342
03:03:14.100 --> 03:03:15.230
Post to Salisbury.

3343
03:03:15.230 --> 03:03:16.730
When thou comest thither--

3344
03:03:16.730 --> 03:03:17.900
Dull, unmindful villain,

3345
03:03:17.900 --> 03:03:19.800
why stayest thou here andgoest not to the duke?

3346
03:03:19.800 --> 03:03:22.500
First, mighty liege, tellme your highness' pleasure,

3347
03:03:22.500 --> 03:03:25.400
what from your grace Ishall deliver to him.

3348
03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:27.400
O true, good Catesby.

3349
03:03:27.400 --> 03:03:28.570
Bid him levy straight

3350
03:03:28.570 --> 03:03:30.500
the greatest strength andpower that he can make

3351
03:03:30.500 --> 03:03:32.200
and meet me suddenly atSalisbury.

3352
03:03:32.200 --> 03:03:33.830
I go.

3353
03:03:33.830 --> 03:03:36.670
What may it please youshall I do at Salisbury?

3354
03:03:36.670 --> 03:03:38.600
Why, what wouldst thou dothere before I go?

3355
03:03:38.600 --> 03:03:41.170
Your highness told me Ishould post before.

3356
03:03:41.170 --> 03:03:43.330
My mind is changed.

3357
03:03:43.330 --> 03:03:45.670
Stanley, what news withyou?

3358
03:03:46.770 --> 03:03:49.470
None good, my liege, toplease you with the hearing,

3359
03:03:49.470 --> 03:03:52.130
nor none so bad but wellmay be reported.

3360
03:03:52.130 --> 03:03:54.030
Hoyday, a riddle.

3361
03:03:54.030 --> 03:03:55.970
Neither good nor bad.

3362
03:03:55.970 --> 03:03:57.830
What needest thou run somany miles about,

3363
03:03:57.830 --> 03:04:00.170
when thou mayest tell thytale the nearest way?

3364
03:04:00.170 --> 03:04:01.730
Once more, what news?

3365
03:04:01.730 --> 03:04:03.700
Richmond is on the seas.

3366
03:04:03.700 --> 03:04:05.870
There let him sink, and bethe seas on him.

3367
03:04:05.870 --> 03:04:08.770
White-livered runagate!

3368
03:04:08.770 --> 03:04:09.930
What doth he there?

3369
03:04:09.930 --> 03:04:12.530
I know not, mightysovereign, but by guess.

3370
03:04:12.530 --> 03:04:14.800
Well, as you guess.

3371
03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:17.500
Stirred up by Dorset,Buckingham, and Ely,

3372
03:04:17.500 --> 03:04:20.030
he makes for England, hereto claim the crown.

3373
03:04:20.030 --> 03:04:21.800
Is the chair empty?

3374
03:04:21.800 --> 03:04:23.300
Is the sword unswayed?

3375
03:04:23.300 --> 03:04:26.470
Is the king dead, theempire unpossessed?

3376
03:04:26.470 --> 03:04:29.130
What heir of York is therealive but we?

3377
03:04:29.130 --> 03:04:32.970
And who is England's kingbut great York's heir?

3378
03:04:32.970 --> 03:04:36.500
Then tell me, what makeshe upon the seas?

3379
03:04:36.500 --> 03:04:39.130
Unless for that, my liege,I cannot guess.

3380
03:04:39.130 --> 03:04:42.400
Unless for that he comesto be your liege,

3381
03:04:42.400 --> 03:04:45.600
you cannot guess whereforethe Welshman comes.

3382
03:04:48.130 --> 03:04:50.530
Thou wilt revolt and flyto him, I fear.

3383
03:04:50.530 --> 03:04:52.430
No, my good lord.

3384
03:04:52.430 --> 03:04:54.270
Therefore mistrust me not.

3385
03:04:56.330 --> 03:04:58.600
Where is thy power, then,to beat him back?

3386
03:04:58.600 --> 03:05:00.770
Where be thy tenants andthy followers?

3387
03:05:01.900 --> 03:05:03.830
Are they not now upon thewestern shore,

3388
03:05:03.830 --> 03:05:05.830
safe-conducting the rebelsfrom their ships?

3389
03:05:05.830 --> 03:05:07.230
No, my good lord.

3390
03:05:07.230 --> 03:05:08.830
My friends are in thenorth.

3391
03:05:08.830 --> 03:05:10.000
Cold friends to me!

3392
03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:11.170
What do they in the north,

3393
03:05:11.170 --> 03:05:13.500
when they should serve theirsovereign in the west?

3394
03:05:13.500 --> 03:05:16.770
They have not beencommanded, mighty king.

3395
03:05:16.770 --> 03:05:19.300
Pleaseth your majesty togive me leave,

3396
03:05:19.300 --> 03:05:21.570
I'll muster up my friendsand meet your grace

3397
03:05:21.570 --> 03:05:24.700
where and what time yourmajesty shall please.

3398
03:05:24.700 --> 03:05:26.470
Aye.

3399
03:05:26.470 --> 03:05:31.070
Aye, thou wouldst be goneto join with Richmond.

3400
03:05:32.370 --> 03:05:34.070
But I'll not trust thee.

3401
03:05:34.070 --> 03:05:36.230
Most mighty sovereign,

3402
03:05:36.230 --> 03:05:40.230
you have no cause to holdmy friendship doubtful.

3403
03:05:40.230 --> 03:05:43.400
I never was nor never willbe false.

3404
03:05:45.370 --> 03:05:46.930
Go then and muster men.

3405
03:05:48.970 --> 03:05:52.470
But leave behind your son,George Stanley.

3406
03:05:52.470 --> 03:05:53.930
Look your heart be firm,

3407
03:05:53.930 --> 03:05:56.730
or else his head'sassurance is but frail.

3408
03:05:59.830 --> 03:06:03.400
So deal with him as Iprove true to you.

3409
03:06:05.570 --> 03:06:07.730
My gracious sovereign...

3410
03:06:07.730 --> 03:06:10.170
now in Devonshire, as I byfriends am well advertised,

3411
03:06:10.170 --> 03:06:12.000
Sir Edward Courtney andthe haughty prelate,

3412
03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:13.570
bishop of Exeter, hiselder brother,

3413
03:06:13.570 --> 03:06:15.930
with many moreconfederates, are in arms.

3414
03:06:15.930 --> 03:06:19.370
My liege, in Kent, theGuildfords are in arms.

3415
03:06:19.370 --> 03:06:21.470
And every hour, morecompetitors flock to therebels,

3416
03:06:21.470 --> 03:06:22.730
and their power growsstrong.

3417
03:06:22.730 --> 03:06:24.970
My lord, the army of greatBuckingham--

3418
03:06:24.970 --> 03:06:26.070
Out on you, owls!

3419
03:06:26.070 --> 03:06:27.570
Nothing but songs ofdeath?

3420
03:06:27.570 --> 03:06:30.270
There, take thou that tillthou bring better news.

3421
03:06:30.270 --> 03:06:31.700
The news I have to tellyour majesty

3422
03:06:31.700 --> 03:06:33.800
is that by sudden floodsand fall of waters,

3423
03:06:33.800 --> 03:06:36.200
Buckingham's army isdispersed and scattered

3424
03:06:36.200 --> 03:06:39.370
and he himself wandered awayalone, no man knows whither.

3425
03:06:42.270 --> 03:06:43.930
I cry thee mercy.

3426
03:06:43.930 --> 03:06:46.930
There is my purse to curethat blow of thine.

3427
03:06:46.930 --> 03:06:49.170
Hath any well-advisedfriend proclaimed reward

3428
03:06:49.170 --> 03:06:50.770
to him that brings thetraitor in?

3429
03:06:50.770 --> 03:06:52.430
Such proclamation hathbeen made, my lord.

3430
03:06:52.430 --> 03:06:54.230
Sir Thomas Lovel and LordMarquis Dorset,

3431
03:06:54.230 --> 03:06:56.070
'tis said, my liege, inYorkshire are in arms.

3432
03:06:56.070 --> 03:06:57.870
But this good comfortbring I to your highness:

3433
03:06:57.870 --> 03:07:00.230
the Breton navy isdispersed by tempest!

3434
03:07:00.230 --> 03:07:02.800
Richmond in Dorsetshire sentout a boat unto the shore

3435
03:07:02.800 --> 03:07:04.270
to ask those on the banks

3436
03:07:04.270 --> 03:07:05.800
if they were hisassistants, yea or no.

3437
03:07:05.800 --> 03:07:07.870
Who answered him, theycame from Buckingham,

3438
03:07:07.870 --> 03:07:08.900
upon his party.

3439
03:07:08.900 --> 03:07:11.400
He, mistrusting them,hoist sail

3440
03:07:11.400 --> 03:07:13.870
and made his course againfor Brittany.

3441
03:07:13.870 --> 03:07:16.430
March on, march on, sincewe are up in arms,

3442
03:07:16.430 --> 03:07:18.330
if not to fight withforeign enemies,

3443
03:07:18.330 --> 03:07:20.530
yet to beat down theserebels here at home.

3444
03:07:20.530 --> 03:07:23.900
My liege! The Duke ofBuckingham is taken!

3445
03:07:25.900 --> 03:07:27.400
That is the best news.

3446
03:07:27.400 --> 03:07:29.070
That the Earl of Richmond

3447
03:07:29.070 --> 03:07:31.370
is with a mighty powerlanded at Milford

3448
03:07:31.370 --> 03:07:34.500
is colder tidings, yetthey must be told.

3449
03:07:34.500 --> 03:07:35.800
Away toward Salisbury.

3450
03:07:35.800 --> 03:07:36.930
While we reason here,

3451
03:07:36.930 --> 03:07:38.670
a royal battle might bewon and lost.

3452
03:07:38.670 --> 03:07:39.800
Someone take order

3453
03:07:39.800 --> 03:07:41.500
that Buckingham be broughtto Salisbury.

3454
03:07:41.500 --> 03:07:43.370
The rest march on with me!

3455
03:08:00.700 --> 03:08:03.930
Sir Christopher, tellRichmond this from me:

3456
03:08:03.930 --> 03:08:06.430
that in the sty of themost deadly boar,

3457
03:08:06.430 --> 03:08:09.670
my son George Stanley isfranked up in hold.

3458
03:08:09.670 --> 03:08:12.170
If I revolt, off goesyoung George's head.

3459
03:08:12.170 --> 03:08:15.130
'Tis fear of that holdsoff my present aid.

3460
03:08:15.130 --> 03:08:17.400
So get thee gone.

3461
03:08:17.400 --> 03:08:19.430
Commend me to thy lord.

3462
03:08:19.430 --> 03:08:22.970
Withal, say that the queenhath heartily consented

3463
03:08:22.970 --> 03:08:25.170
he should espouseElizabeth, her daughter.

3464
03:08:26.830 --> 03:08:29.700
But tell me, where isprincely Richmond now?

3465
03:08:29.700 --> 03:08:32.370
At Pembroke or atHarford-west in Wales

3466
03:08:32.370 --> 03:08:34.500
with many other of greatname and worth,

3467
03:08:34.500 --> 03:08:37.330
and towards London do theybend their power

3468
03:08:37.330 --> 03:08:39.300
if by the way, they be notfought withal.

3469
03:08:39.300 --> 03:08:40.700
O, hie thee to thy lord.

3470
03:08:40.700 --> 03:08:41.800
I kiss his hand.

3471
03:08:41.800 --> 03:08:44.200
My letter will resolve himof my mind.

3472
03:08:44.200 --> 03:08:45.700
Farewell.

3473
03:09:08.970 --> 03:09:12.130
Will not King Richard letme speak with him?

3474
03:09:12.130 --> 03:09:13.600
No, my good lord.

3475
03:09:16.200 --> 03:09:17.500
Therefore, be patient.

3476
03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:26.670
Hastings and Edward'schildren,

3477
03:09:26.670 --> 03:09:30.170
Grey and Rivers, holy KingHenry,

3478
03:09:30.170 --> 03:09:34.770
and thy fair son Edward,Vaughan,

3479
03:09:34.770 --> 03:09:36.830
and all that hathmiscarried

3480
03:09:36.830 --> 03:09:41.470
by underhand, corruptedfoul injustice,

3481
03:09:41.470 --> 03:09:43.730
if that your moody,discontented souls

3482
03:09:43.730 --> 03:09:47.530
do through the cloudsbehold this present hour,

3483
03:09:47.530 --> 03:09:51.070
even for revenge, mock mydestruction.

3484
03:09:56.270 --> 03:09:58.600
This is All Souls' Day,fellow, is it not?

3485
03:10:01.630 --> 03:10:02.970
It is.

3486
03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:07.900
Why, then, All Souls' Dayis my body's doomsday.

3487
03:10:11.130 --> 03:10:13.130
This is the day which inKing Edward's time

3488
03:10:13.130 --> 03:10:15.730
I wished might fall on me

3489
03:10:15.730 --> 03:10:19.070
when I was found false tohis children and hiswife's allies.

3490
03:10:21.470 --> 03:10:25.400
This is the day wherein Iwished to fall

3491
03:10:25.400 --> 03:10:29.730
by the false faith of himwhom most I trusted.

3492
03:10:31.470 --> 03:10:37.770
This, this All Souls' Day

3493
03:10:37.770 --> 03:10:43.730
to my fearful soul is thedetermined respite of mywrongs.

3494
03:10:45.830 --> 03:10:48.000
That high All-Seer which Idallied with

3495
03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:51.800
hath turned my feignedprayer on my head

3496
03:10:51.800 --> 03:10:56.570
and given in earnest whatI begged in jest.

3497
03:10:58.930 --> 03:11:04.470
Thus doth he force theswords of wicked men

3498
03:11:04.470 --> 03:11:07.900
to turn their own pointsin their masters' bosoms.

3499
03:11:10.200 --> 03:11:13.600
Thus Margaret's cursefalls heavy on my neck.

3500
03:11:15.370 --> 03:11:21.470
"When he," quoth she,

3501
03:11:21.470 --> 03:11:28.700
"shall split thy heartwith sorrow,

3502
03:11:28.700 --> 03:11:31.700
remember Margaret was aprophetess."

3503
03:11:43.900 --> 03:11:45.970
Come, Ratcliffe.

3504
03:11:45.970 --> 03:11:49.230
Lead me to the block ofshame.

3505
03:11:49.230 --> 03:11:53.870
Wrong hath but wrong

3506
03:11:53.870 --> 03:11:58.530
and blame the due ofblame.

3507
03:13:21.800 --> 03:13:25.000
Fellows in arms and mymost loving friends,

3508
03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:27.500
bruised underneath theyoke of tyranny,

3509
03:13:27.500 --> 03:13:30.170
thus far into the bowelsof the land

3510
03:13:30.170 --> 03:13:33.430
have we marched on withoutimpediment.

3511
03:13:33.430 --> 03:13:36.100
And here receive we fromour father, Stanley,

3512
03:13:36.100 --> 03:13:39.730
lines of fair comfort andencouragement.

3513
03:13:41.070 --> 03:13:44.670
The wretched, bloody, andusurping boar

3514
03:13:44.670 --> 03:13:48.930
that spoiled your summerfields and fruitful vines,

3515
03:13:48.930 --> 03:13:51.370
swills your warm bloodlike wash

3516
03:13:51.370 --> 03:13:55.300
and makes his trough inyour emboweled bosoms--

3517
03:13:55.300 --> 03:14:00.770
this foul swine is now evenin the center of this isle

3518
03:14:00.770 --> 03:14:03.500
near to the town ofLeicester, as we learn.

3519
03:14:04.730 --> 03:14:08.430
From Tamworth thither isbut one day's march.

3520
03:14:09.530 --> 03:14:12.570
In God's name, cheerly on,courageous friends,

3521
03:14:12.570 --> 03:14:15.470
to reap the harvest ofperpetual peace

3522
03:14:15.470 --> 03:14:18.500
by this one bloody trialof sharp war.

3523
03:14:18.500 --> 03:14:20.930
Every man's conscience isa thousand men

3524
03:14:20.930 --> 03:14:23.070
to fight against thisguilty homicide.

3525
03:14:23.070 --> 03:14:26.200
I doubt not but hisfriends will turn to us.

3526
03:14:26.200 --> 03:14:29.270
He hath no friends butwhat are friends for fear,

3527
03:14:29.270 --> 03:14:32.100
which in his dearest needwill fly from him.

3528
03:14:32.100 --> 03:14:34.370
All for our vantage.

3529
03:14:34.370 --> 03:14:36.600
Then in God's name, march.

3530
03:14:36.600 --> 03:14:40.000
True hope is swift andflies with swallow's wings.

3531
03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:44.400
Kings it makes gods andmeaner creatures kings.

3532
03:15:02.400 --> 03:15:06.700
Here pitch our tent, evenhere in Bosworth Field.

3533
03:15:11.700 --> 03:15:14.930
My Lord of Surrey, whylook you so sad?

3534
03:15:14.930 --> 03:15:18.430
My heart is ten timeslighter than my looks.

3535
03:15:18.430 --> 03:15:19.430
My Lord of Norfolk.

3536
03:15:19.430 --> 03:15:20.800
Here, most gracious liege.

3537
03:15:20.800 --> 03:15:24.800
Norfolk, we must haveknocks. Huh, must we not?

3538
03:15:24.800 --> 03:15:27.800
We must both give andtake, my loving lord.

3539
03:15:31.270 --> 03:15:32.600
Up with my tent!

3540
03:15:34.170 --> 03:15:36.100
Here will I lie tonight.

3541
03:15:36.100 --> 03:15:37.930
But where tomorrow?

3542
03:15:37.930 --> 03:15:39.430
Well, all's one for that.

3543
03:15:41.500 --> 03:15:44.270
Who hath descried thenumber of the traitors?

3544
03:15:44.270 --> 03:15:46.970
Six or seven thousand istheir utmost power.

3545
03:15:46.970 --> 03:15:50.200
Why, our battalion treblesthat account.

3546
03:15:52.230 --> 03:15:55.570
Besides, the king's nameis a tower of strength

3547
03:15:55.570 --> 03:15:58.000
which they upon theadverse faction want.

3548
03:16:02.130 --> 03:16:03.570
Up with the tent!

3549
03:16:07.800 --> 03:16:09.200
Come, noble gentlemen.

3550
03:16:09.200 --> 03:16:12.170
Let us survey the vantageof the ground.

3551
03:16:12.170 --> 03:16:14.370
Call for some men of sounddirection.

3552
03:16:14.370 --> 03:16:17.300
Let's lack no discipline,make no delay.

3553
03:16:17.300 --> 03:16:19.800
For, lords, tomorrow is abusy day.

3554
03:16:38.830 --> 03:16:43.030
The weary sun hath made agolden set,

3555
03:16:43.030 --> 03:16:46.000
and by the bright track ofhis fiery car

3556
03:16:46.000 --> 03:16:48.170
gives token of a goodlyday tomorrow.

3557
03:16:52.070 --> 03:16:54.870
Sir William Brandon, youshall bear my standard.

3558
03:16:56.170 --> 03:16:58.570
Give me some ink and paperin my tent.

3559
03:17:00.370 --> 03:17:02.530
I'll draw the form andmodel of our battle.

3560
03:17:02.530 --> 03:17:04.900
Limit each leader to hisseveral charge,

3561
03:17:04.900 --> 03:17:07.800
and part in just proportionour small power.

3562
03:17:09.170 --> 03:17:12.200
My Lord of Dorset, you,Sir William Brandon,

3563
03:17:12.200 --> 03:17:14.630
and you, Sir WalterHerbert, stay with me.

3564
03:17:14.630 --> 03:17:16.800
The Earl of Pembroke keepshis regiment.

3565
03:17:16.800 --> 03:17:20.170
Good Captain Blunt, bearmy good night to him,

3566
03:17:20.170 --> 03:17:22.270
and by the second hour inthe morning,

3567
03:17:22.270 --> 03:17:24.900
desire the earl to see mein my tent.

3568
03:17:24.900 --> 03:17:27.700
Yet one thing more, goodCaptain, do for me.

3569
03:17:29.700 --> 03:17:31.570
Where is Lord Stanleyquartered?

3570
03:17:31.570 --> 03:17:33.270
Do you know?

3571
03:17:33.270 --> 03:17:35.430
Unless I have mista'en hiscolors much,

3572
03:17:35.430 --> 03:17:38.230
which well I am assured Ihave not done,

3573
03:17:38.230 --> 03:17:40.230
his regiment lies half amile at least

3574
03:17:40.230 --> 03:17:42.170
south from the mightypower of the king.

3575
03:17:43.900 --> 03:17:46.500
If without peril it bepossible, sweet Blunt,

3576
03:17:46.500 --> 03:17:48.930
make some good means tospeak with him,

3577
03:17:48.930 --> 03:17:52.070
and give him from me thismost needful note.

3578
03:17:54.170 --> 03:17:56.500
Upon my life, my lord,I'll undertake it.

3579
03:17:57.900 --> 03:18:01.430
So God give you quiet resttonight.

3580
03:18:01.430 --> 03:18:05.430
Good night, good CaptainBlunt.

3581
03:18:08.070 --> 03:18:09.270
Come, gentlemen.

3582
03:18:09.270 --> 03:18:12.370
Let us consult upontomorrow's business.

3583
03:18:12.370 --> 03:18:14.100
Into my tent.

3584
03:18:14.100 --> 03:18:16.330
The dew is raw and cold.

3585
03:18:20.930 --> 03:18:22.270
What is't o'clock?

3586
03:18:24.400 --> 03:18:26.900
It's suppertime, my lord.

3587
03:18:26.900 --> 03:18:28.270
It's nine o'clock.

3588
03:18:30.170 --> 03:18:31.870
I will not sup tonight.

3589
03:18:34.570 --> 03:18:36.330
Give me some ink andpaper.

3590
03:18:37.800 --> 03:18:40.130
What, is my armor easierthan it was?

3591
03:18:40.130 --> 03:18:42.970
It is, my liege; and allthings are in readiness.

3592
03:18:44.270 --> 03:18:46.930
Good Norfolk.

3593
03:18:46.930 --> 03:18:48.170
Hie thee to thy charge.

3594
03:18:48.170 --> 03:18:51.130
Use careful watch. Choosetrusty sentinels.

3595
03:18:51.130 --> 03:18:52.370
I go, my lord.

3596
03:18:53.530 --> 03:18:55.900
Stir with the larktomorrow, gentle Norfolk.

3597
03:18:55.900 --> 03:18:58.230
I warrant you, my lord.

3598
03:19:04.700 --> 03:19:05.870
Catesby.

3599
03:19:05.870 --> 03:19:07.370
My lord?

3600
03:19:07.370 --> 03:19:10.700
Send out a pursuivant atarms to Stanley's regiment.

3601
03:19:10.700 --> 03:19:13.530
Bid him bring his powerbefore sunrising,

3602
03:19:13.530 --> 03:19:14.900
lest his son George

3603
03:19:14.900 --> 03:19:17.300
fall into the blind caveof eternal night.

3604
03:19:23.900 --> 03:19:25.530
Fill me a bowl of wine.

3605
03:19:28.900 --> 03:19:31.400
Give me a watch!

3606
03:19:31.400 --> 03:19:34.300
Saddle white Surrey forthe field tomorrow.

3607
03:19:34.300 --> 03:19:36.970
Look that my staves besound and not too heavy.

3608
03:19:41.230 --> 03:19:42.230
Ratcliffe.

3609
03:19:42.230 --> 03:19:43.300
My lord.

3610
03:19:43.300 --> 03:19:46.000
Sawest thou the melancholyLord Northumberland?

3611
03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:48.270
Thomas the Earl of Surreyand himself,

3612
03:19:48.270 --> 03:19:50.300
much about cock-shut time,from troop to troop

3613
03:19:50.300 --> 03:19:53.870
went through the army,cheering up the soldiers.

3614
03:19:53.870 --> 03:19:55.970
So I am satisfied.

3615
03:20:02.030 --> 03:20:04.430
Give me a bowl of wine.

3616
03:20:07.030 --> 03:20:08.670
I have not that alacrityof spirit

3617
03:20:08.670 --> 03:20:11.000
nor cheer of mind that Iwas wont to have.

3618
03:20:13.200 --> 03:20:14.430
Set it down.

3619
03:20:15.730 --> 03:20:18.170
Is ink and paper ready?

3620
03:20:18.170 --> 03:20:19.530
It is, my lord.

3621
03:20:22.470 --> 03:20:23.470
Bid my guard watch.

3622
03:20:23.470 --> 03:20:24.900
Leave me.

3623
03:20:27.900 --> 03:20:28.970
Ratcliffe.

3624
03:20:33.730 --> 03:20:34.730
About the mid of night,

3625
03:20:34.730 --> 03:20:37.430
come to my tent and helpto arm me.

3626
03:20:45.070 --> 03:20:46.130
Leave me, I say.

3627
03:21:03.930 --> 03:21:06.100
Fortune and victory sit onthy helm.

3628
03:21:07.570 --> 03:21:09.600
All comfort that the darknight can afford

3629
03:21:09.600 --> 03:21:11.870
be to thy person, noblefather-in-law.

3630
03:21:11.870 --> 03:21:15.170
Tell me, how fares ourloving mother?

3631
03:21:15.170 --> 03:21:17.100
I, by attorney, bless theefrom thy mother,

3632
03:21:17.100 --> 03:21:19.130
who prays continually forRichmond's good.

3633
03:21:19.130 --> 03:21:20.200
So much for that.

3634
03:21:20.200 --> 03:21:21.930
The silent hours steal on,

3635
03:21:21.930 --> 03:21:24.000
and flaky darkness breakswithin the east.

3636
03:21:24.000 --> 03:21:27.000
In brief, for so theseason bids us be,

3637
03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:30.000
prepare thy battle earlyin the morning,

3638
03:21:30.000 --> 03:21:31.970
and put thy fortune to thearbitraments

3639
03:21:31.970 --> 03:21:34.470
of bloody strokes andmortal-staring war.

3640
03:21:34.470 --> 03:21:37.330
I, as I may-- that which Iwould I cannot--

3641
03:21:37.330 --> 03:21:39.530
with best advantage willdeceive the time

3642
03:21:39.530 --> 03:21:42.200
and aid thee in thisdoubtful shock of arms.

3643
03:21:42.200 --> 03:21:45.030
But on thy side, I may notbe too forward

3644
03:21:45.030 --> 03:21:47.400
lest, being seen, thybrother, tender George,

3645
03:21:47.400 --> 03:21:50.530
be executed in hisfather's sight.

3646
03:21:50.530 --> 03:21:51.730
Farewell.

3647
03:21:51.730 --> 03:21:53.000
The leisure and thefearful time

3648
03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:55.100
cuts off the ceremoniousvows of love

3649
03:21:55.100 --> 03:21:57.500
which so long-sunderedfriends should dwell upon.

3650
03:22:00.200 --> 03:22:02.930
God give us leisure forthese rites of love.

3651
03:22:02.930 --> 03:22:04.630
Once more, adieu.

3652
03:22:04.630 --> 03:22:06.630
Be valiant, and speedwell.

3653
03:22:12.570 --> 03:22:14.900
Good lords, conduct him tohis regiment.

3654
03:22:16.430 --> 03:22:20.330
I'll strive with troubledthoughts to take a nap,

3655
03:22:20.330 --> 03:22:22.970
lest leaden slumber peiseme down tomorrow,

3656
03:22:22.970 --> 03:22:25.270
when I should mount withwings of victory.

3657
03:22:27.400 --> 03:22:29.830
Once more, good night,kind lords and gentlemen.

3658
03:22:56.300 --> 03:22:58.300
O Thou, whose captain Iaccount myself,

3659
03:22:58.300 --> 03:23:02.130
look on my forces with agracious eye.

3660
03:23:02.130 --> 03:23:04.830
Put in their hands thybruising irons of wrath,

3661
03:23:04.830 --> 03:23:06.730
that they may crush downwith a heavy fall

3662
03:23:06.730 --> 03:23:09.270
the usurping helmets ofour adversaries.

3663
03:23:11.200 --> 03:23:13.030
Make us thy ministers ofchastisement,

3664
03:23:13.030 --> 03:23:15.570
that we may praise thee inthe victory.

3665
03:23:18.900 --> 03:23:20.670
To thee I do commend mywatchful soul,

3666
03:23:20.670 --> 03:23:22.800
ere I let fall the windowsof mine eyes.

3667
03:23:24.470 --> 03:23:28.170
Sleeping and waking, O,defend me still.

3668
03:23:55.370 --> 03:23:59.830
My prayers on the adverseparty fight.

3669
03:23:59.830 --> 03:24:03.300
And there the little soulsof Edward's children

3670
03:24:03.300 --> 03:24:06.000
whisper the spirits ofthine enemies

3671
03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:10.300
and promise them successand victory.

3672
03:24:10.300 --> 03:24:12.370
Bloody thou art.

3673
03:24:12.370 --> 03:24:15.200
Bloody will be thy end.

3674
03:24:15.200 --> 03:24:20.300
Shame serves thy life anddoth thy death attend.

3675
03:24:23.270 --> 03:24:26.230
Let me sit heavy on thysoul tomorrow.

3676
03:24:26.230 --> 03:24:27.730
Think how thou stabbest me

3677
03:24:27.730 --> 03:24:29.930
in my prime of youth atTewksbury.

3678
03:24:29.930 --> 03:24:32.900
Despair, therefore, anddie.

3679
03:24:42.030 --> 03:24:43.830
Be cheerful, Richmond,

3680
03:24:43.830 --> 03:24:46.230
for the wronged souls ofbutchered princes

3681
03:24:46.230 --> 03:24:48.330
fight in thy behalf.

3682
03:24:48.330 --> 03:24:52.030
King Henry's issue,Richmond, comforts thee.

3683
03:24:54.900 --> 03:24:57.200
When I was mortal, myanointed body

3684
03:24:57.200 --> 03:25:00.200
by thee was punched fullof deadly holes.

3685
03:25:00.200 --> 03:25:03.330
Think on the Tower and me.

3686
03:25:03.330 --> 03:25:06.330
Despair, and die.

3687
03:25:06.330 --> 03:25:10.130
Harry the Sixth bids theedespair, and die.

3688
03:25:11.670 --> 03:25:16.570
Virtuous and holy, be thouconqueror.

3689
03:25:16.570 --> 03:25:18.970
Harry, that prophesiedthou shouldst be king,

3690
03:25:18.970 --> 03:25:21.830
doth comfort thee in thysleep.

3691
03:25:21.830 --> 03:25:24.270
Live, and flourish.

3692
03:25:25.500 --> 03:25:28.830
Let me sit heavy on thysoul tomorrow.

3693
03:25:28.830 --> 03:25:31.670
I, that was washed todeath with fulsome wine,

3694
03:25:31.670 --> 03:25:36.170
poor Clarence, by thyguile betrayed to death.

3695
03:25:36.170 --> 03:25:39.070
Tomorrow in the battle,think on me,

3696
03:25:39.070 --> 03:25:41.700
and fall thy edgelesssword.

3697
03:25:41.700 --> 03:25:44.630
Despair, and die.

3698
03:25:45.770 --> 03:25:48.400
Thou offspring of thehouse of Lancaster,

3699
03:25:48.400 --> 03:25:51.600
the wronged heirs of York,do pray for thee.

3700
03:25:51.600 --> 03:25:54.400
Good angels guard thybattle.

3701
03:25:54.400 --> 03:25:57.230
Live, and flourish.

3702
03:26:00.470 --> 03:26:03.730
Let me sit heavy on thysoul tomorrow:

3703
03:26:03.730 --> 03:26:07.100
Rivers, that died atPomfret.

3704
03:26:07.100 --> 03:26:10.470
Despair, and die.

3705
03:26:11.900 --> 03:26:17.400
Think upon Grey, and letthy soul despair.

3706
03:26:17.400 --> 03:26:19.000
Think upon Vaughan,

3707
03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:22.500
and with guilty fear, letfall thy lance.

3708
03:26:22.500 --> 03:26:25.970
Despair, and die.

3709
03:26:27.070 --> 03:26:29.730
Awake, and think ourwrongs

3710
03:26:29.730 --> 03:26:32.800
in Richard's bosom willconquer him.

3711
03:26:32.800 --> 03:26:36.330
Awake, and win the day.

3712
03:26:37.470 --> 03:26:43.230
Bloody and guilty,guiltily awake,

3713
03:26:43.230 --> 03:26:47.900
and in a bloody battle,end thy days.

3714
03:26:47.900 --> 03:26:50.170
Think on Lord Hastings.

3715
03:26:51.130 --> 03:26:54.030
Despair, and die.

3716
03:26:55.200 --> 03:27:01.200
Quiet, untroubled soul,awake, awake.

3717
03:27:01.200 --> 03:27:06.530
Arm, fight, and conquer,for fair England's sake.

3718
03:27:07.700 --> 03:27:11.600
Dream on thy cousins,smothered in the Tower.

3719
03:27:11.600 --> 03:27:15.730
Let us be led within thybosom, Richard,

3720
03:27:15.730 --> 03:27:21.030
and weigh thee down toruin, shame, and death.

3721
03:27:21.030 --> 03:27:25.300
Thy nephews' souls bidthee despair and die.

3722
03:27:26.470 --> 03:27:28.400
Sleep, Richmond.

3723
03:27:28.400 --> 03:27:31.700
Sleep in peace, and wakein joy.

3724
03:27:31.700 --> 03:27:35.300
Good angels guard theefrom the boar's annoy.

3725
03:27:35.300 --> 03:27:39.830
Live, and beget a happyrace of kings.

3726
03:27:39.830 --> 03:27:44.000
Edward's unhappy sons dobid thee flourish.

3727
03:27:46.130 --> 03:27:48.930
Richard, thy wife,

3728
03:27:48.930 --> 03:27:51.270
that wretched Anne, thywife,

3729
03:27:51.270 --> 03:27:54.730
that never slept a quiethour with thee,

3730
03:27:54.730 --> 03:27:58.500
now fills thy sleep withperturbations.

3731
03:27:58.500 --> 03:28:00.700
Tomorrow in the battle,think on me,

3732
03:28:00.700 --> 03:28:03.500
and fall thy edgelesssword.

3733
03:28:03.500 --> 03:28:05.370
Despair, and die.

3734
03:28:06.400 --> 03:28:11.630
Thou quiet soul, sleepthou a quiet sleep.

3735
03:28:11.630 --> 03:28:15.270
Dream of success and happyvictory.

3736
03:28:15.270 --> 03:28:19.100
Thy adversary's wife dothpray for thee.

3737
03:28:32.670 --> 03:28:36.670
The first was I thathelped thee to the crown.

3738
03:28:36.670 --> 03:28:39.830
The last was I that feltthy tyranny.

3739
03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:43.200
O, in the battle, think ofBuckingham.

3740
03:28:43.200 --> 03:28:47.030
Die in terror of thyguiltiness.

3741
03:28:47.030 --> 03:28:48.630
Dream on.

3742
03:28:48.630 --> 03:28:52.800
Dream on of bloody deedsand death.

3743
03:28:52.800 --> 03:28:54.870
Fainting, despair.

3744
03:28:54.870 --> 03:28:58.530
Despairing, yield thybreath.

3745
03:29:03.430 --> 03:29:06.030
I died for hope ere Icould lend thee aid.

3746
03:29:06.030 --> 03:29:09.630
But cheer thy heart, andbe thou not dismayed.

3747
03:29:09.630 --> 03:29:14.700
God and good angels fighton Richmond's side.

3748
03:29:14.700 --> 03:29:17.970
And Richard fall, inheight of all his pride.

3749
03:29:20.300 --> 03:29:22.070
Give me another horse!

3750
03:29:22.070 --> 03:29:23.570
Bind up my wounds!

3751
03:29:23.570 --> 03:29:26.130
Have mercy, Jesu.

3752
03:29:26.130 --> 03:29:27.600
Soft, I did but dream.

3753
03:29:29.130 --> 03:29:31.570
Coward conscience, howdost thou afflict me.

3754
03:29:35.970 --> 03:29:37.670
The lights burn blue.

3755
03:29:40.530 --> 03:29:42.700
'Tis now dead midnight.

3756
03:29:50.170 --> 03:29:52.770
Cold, fearful drops standon my trembling flesh.

3757
03:29:56.100 --> 03:29:58.270
What do I fear?

3758
03:29:58.270 --> 03:29:59.900
Myself?

3759
03:29:59.900 --> 03:30:01.930
There's none else by.

3760
03:30:01.930 --> 03:30:03.270
Richard loves Richard.

3761
03:30:03.270 --> 03:30:05.270
That is I and I.

3762
03:30:05.270 --> 03:30:06.600
Is there a murderer here?

3763
03:30:06.600 --> 03:30:09.270
No. Yes, I am.

3764
03:30:09.270 --> 03:30:10.800
Then fly.

3765
03:30:10.800 --> 03:30:11.970
What, from myself?

3766
03:30:11.970 --> 03:30:13.930
Great reason why, lest Irevenge.

3767
03:30:13.930 --> 03:30:16.270
What, myself upon myself?

3768
03:30:16.270 --> 03:30:17.630
Alack, I love myself.

3769
03:30:17.630 --> 03:30:18.700
Wherefore?

3770
03:30:18.700 --> 03:30:20.770
For any good that I myselfhave done unto myself?

3771
03:30:20.770 --> 03:30:22.770
O, no! Alas, I rather hatemyself

3772
03:30:22.770 --> 03:30:25.300
for hateful deedscommitted by myself.

3773
03:30:25.300 --> 03:30:26.500
I am a villain.

3774
03:30:26.500 --> 03:30:27.800
Yet I lie. I am not.

3775
03:30:27.800 --> 03:30:28.970
Fool, of thyself speakwell.

3776
03:30:28.970 --> 03:30:31.570
Fool, do not flatter!

3777
03:30:31.570 --> 03:30:33.970
My conscience hath athousand several tongues,

3778
03:30:33.970 --> 03:30:36.200
and every tongue brings ina several tale,

3779
03:30:36.200 --> 03:30:39.200
and every tale condemns mefor a villain.

3780
03:30:39.200 --> 03:30:41.300
Perjury, perjury, in thehighest degree.

3781
03:30:41.300 --> 03:30:43.800
Murder, stern murder, inthe direst degree.

3782
03:30:43.800 --> 03:30:46.400
All several sins, all usedin each degree,

3783
03:30:46.400 --> 03:30:49.300
throng to the bar, cryingall, "Guilty, guilty."

3784
03:30:50.800 --> 03:30:52.430
I shall despair.

3785
03:30:56.370 --> 03:30:59.270
There is no creature lovesme.

3786
03:30:59.270 --> 03:31:02.830
And if I die, no soul willpity me.

3787
03:31:06.630 --> 03:31:08.570
And wherefore should they,

3788
03:31:08.570 --> 03:31:12.870
since that I myself find inmyself no pity to myself?

3789
03:31:16.400 --> 03:31:20.730
Methought the souls of allthat I'd murdered came tomy tent,

3790
03:31:20.730 --> 03:31:23.530
and every one did threattomorrow's vengeance

3791
03:31:23.530 --> 03:31:24.700
on the head of Richard.

3792
03:31:24.700 --> 03:31:25.700
My lord?

3793
03:31:25.700 --> 03:31:26.900
'Zounds. Who is there?

3794
03:31:26.900 --> 03:31:28.370
Ratcliffe, my lord.

3795
03:31:28.370 --> 03:31:29.570
'Tis I.

3796
03:31:31.430 --> 03:31:32.830
The early village cock

3797
03:31:32.830 --> 03:31:34.870
hath twice done salutationto the morn.

3798
03:31:34.870 --> 03:31:37.870
Your friends are up andbuckle on their armor.

3799
03:31:37.870 --> 03:31:41.070
O Ratcliffe, I havedreamed a fearful dream.

3800
03:31:43.200 --> 03:31:44.470
What thinkest thou?

3801
03:31:44.470 --> 03:31:46.170
Will our friends prove alltrue?

3802
03:31:46.170 --> 03:31:48.370
No doubt, my lord.

3803
03:31:48.370 --> 03:31:49.970
O Ratcliffe, I fear.

3804
03:31:51.470 --> 03:31:53.500
I fear.

3805
03:31:53.500 --> 03:31:55.330
Nay, good my lord.

3806
03:31:55.330 --> 03:31:58.430
Be not afraid of shadows.

3807
03:31:58.430 --> 03:32:00.530
By the apostle Paul,shadows tonight

3808
03:32:00.530 --> 03:32:02.900
have struck more terror tothe soul of Richard

3809
03:32:02.900 --> 03:32:05.770
than can the substance ofa thousand soldiers

3810
03:32:05.770 --> 03:32:08.700
armed in proof and led byshallow Richmond.

3811
03:32:14.400 --> 03:32:17.730
'Tis not yet near day.

3812
03:32:17.730 --> 03:32:19.230
Come, go with me.

3813
03:32:19.230 --> 03:32:21.400
Under our tents, I'll playthe eavesdropper,

3814
03:32:21.400 --> 03:32:23.900
to see if any mean toshrink from me.

3815
03:32:40.830 --> 03:32:41.900
Good morrow, my lord.

3816
03:32:41.900 --> 03:32:43.930
Oh.

3817
03:32:43.930 --> 03:32:46.730
Cry mercy, lords andwatchful gentlemen,

3818
03:32:46.730 --> 03:32:49.230
that you have ta'en atardy sluggard here.

3819
03:32:49.230 --> 03:32:51.970
How have you slept, mylord?

3820
03:32:51.970 --> 03:32:54.530
The sweetest sleep andfairest-boding dreams

3821
03:32:54.530 --> 03:32:56.200
that ever entered in adrowsy head

3822
03:32:56.200 --> 03:32:58.600
have I since yourdeparture had, my lords.

3823
03:33:00.570 --> 03:33:03.300
Methought their soulswhose bodies Richardmurdered

3824
03:33:03.300 --> 03:33:06.370
came to my tent and criedon victory.

3825
03:33:08.470 --> 03:33:10.470
I promise you, my soul isvery jocund

3826
03:33:10.470 --> 03:33:13.170
in the remembrance of sofair a dream.

3827
03:33:13.170 --> 03:33:15.130
How far into the morningis it, lords?

3828
03:33:15.130 --> 03:33:17.170
Upon the stroke of four.

3829
03:33:17.170 --> 03:33:21.200
Why, then, 'tis time toarm and give direction.

3830
03:33:22.630 --> 03:33:24.470
More than I have said,loving countrymen,

3831
03:33:24.470 --> 03:33:27.830
the leisure andenforcement of the timeforbids to dwell upon.

3832
03:33:27.830 --> 03:33:30.630
Yet remember this:

3833
03:33:30.630 --> 03:33:35.370
God and our good causefight upon our side.

3834
03:33:35.370 --> 03:33:38.600
The prayers of holy saintsand wronged souls,

3835
03:33:38.600 --> 03:33:42.100
like high-reared bulwarks,stand before our faces,

3836
03:33:42.100 --> 03:33:44.770
Richard except.

3837
03:33:44.770 --> 03:33:46.830
Those whom we fightagainst

3838
03:33:46.830 --> 03:33:50.100
had rather have us winthan him they follow.

3839
03:33:50.100 --> 03:33:52.630
For what is he theyfollow?

3840
03:33:52.630 --> 03:33:58.370
Truly, gentlemen, a bloodytyrant and a homicide,

3841
03:33:58.370 --> 03:34:03.000
one raised in blood andone in blood established,

3842
03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:05.070
one that made means tocome by what he hath

3843
03:34:05.070 --> 03:34:07.830
and slaughtered those thatwere the means to help him.

3844
03:34:08.500 --> 03:34:11.070
A base, foul stone,

3845
03:34:11.070 --> 03:34:14.200
made precious by the foilof England's chair,

3846
03:34:14.200 --> 03:34:16.930
where he is falsely set.

3847
03:34:16.930 --> 03:34:20.870
One that hath ever beenGod's enemy.

3848
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:24.130
Then, if you fight againstGod's enemy,

3849
03:34:24.130 --> 03:34:27.970
God will in justice wardyou as his soldiers.

3850
03:34:27.970 --> 03:34:30.430
If you do sweat to put atyrant down,

3851
03:34:30.430 --> 03:34:35.100
you sleep in peace, thetyrant being slain.

3852
03:34:35.100 --> 03:34:38.200
If you do fight againstyour country's foes,

3853
03:34:38.200 --> 03:34:42.100
your country's fat shallpay your pains the hire.

3854
03:34:42.100 --> 03:34:45.470
If you do fight insafeguard of your wives,

3855
03:34:45.470 --> 03:34:49.430
your wives shall welcomehome the conquerors.

3856
03:34:49.430 --> 03:34:52.630
If you do free yourchildren from the sword,

3857
03:34:52.630 --> 03:34:56.000
your children's childrenquits it in your age.

3858
03:34:56.000 --> 03:34:59.770
Then, in the name of Godand all these rights,

3859
03:34:59.770 --> 03:35:03.370
advance your standards;draw your willing swords.

3860
03:35:04.570 --> 03:35:08.900
For me, the ransom of mybold attempt

3861
03:35:08.900 --> 03:35:12.200
shall be this cold corpseon the earth's cold face.

3862
03:35:13.270 --> 03:35:17.400
But if I thrive, the gainof my attempt

3863
03:35:17.400 --> 03:35:20.870
the least of you shallshare his part thereof.

3864
03:35:20.870 --> 03:35:24.470
Sound drums and trumpetsboldly and cheerfully.

3865
03:35:24.470 --> 03:35:26.600
God and Saint George.

3866
03:35:26.600 --> 03:35:29.470
Richmond and victory!

3867
03:35:29.870 --> 03:35:34.100
Richmond and victory!

3868
03:35:40.130 --> 03:35:43.000
And what saidNorthumberland as touchingRichmond?

3869
03:35:43.000 --> 03:35:44.770
That he was never trainedup in arms.

3870
03:35:44.770 --> 03:35:46.100
He said the truth.

3871
03:35:46.100 --> 03:35:47.770
And what said Surrey then?

3872
03:35:47.770 --> 03:35:49.930
He smiled and said, "Thebetter for our purpose."

3873
03:35:49.930 --> 03:35:50.930
He was in the right.

3874
03:35:50.930 --> 03:35:53.370
And so indeed it is.

3875
03:35:53.370 --> 03:35:54.700
Ten the clock there.

3876
03:36:04.370 --> 03:36:05.900
Give me a calendar.

3877
03:36:07.770 --> 03:36:09.000
Who saw the sun today?

3878
03:36:09.000 --> 03:36:11.800
Not I, my lord.

3879
03:36:11.800 --> 03:36:13.430
Then he disdains to shine,

3880
03:36:13.430 --> 03:36:16.400
for by the book, he shouldhave braved the east anhour ago.

3881
03:36:16.400 --> 03:36:19.270
A black day will it be tosomebody.

3882
03:36:22.300 --> 03:36:23.470
Ratcliffe.

3883
03:36:23.470 --> 03:36:25.470
My lord?

3884
03:36:25.470 --> 03:36:27.900
The sun will not be seentoday.

3885
03:36:27.900 --> 03:36:30.530
The sky doth frown andlour upon our army.

3886
03:36:31.830 --> 03:36:34.370
I would these dewy tearswere from the ground.

3887
03:36:36.170 --> 03:36:37.930
Not shine today.

3888
03:36:39.530 --> 03:36:42.000
Why, what is that to memore than to Richmond?

3889
03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:44.000
For the selfsame Heaventhat frowns on me

3890
03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:45.200
looks sadly upon him.

3891
03:36:45.200 --> 03:36:47.730
Arm! Arm, my lord!

3892
03:36:47.730 --> 03:36:49.170
The foe vaunts in thefield.

3893
03:36:49.170 --> 03:36:50.800
Come! Bustle, bustle.

3894
03:36:50.800 --> 03:36:52.570
Caparison my horse.

3895
03:36:52.570 --> 03:36:55.930
Call up Lord Stanley; bidhim bring his power.

3896
03:36:55.930 --> 03:36:58.630
I will lead forth mysoldiers to the plain,

3897
03:36:58.630 --> 03:37:02.930
and thus my battle shallbe ordered:

3898
03:37:02.930 --> 03:37:05.470
My forward shall be drawnout all at length,

3899
03:37:05.470 --> 03:37:07.830
consisting equally ofhorse and foot.

3900
03:37:07.830 --> 03:37:09.970
Our archers shall beplaced in the midst.

3901
03:37:09.970 --> 03:37:12.170
John, Duke of Norfolk,Thomas, Earl of Surrey

3902
03:37:12.170 --> 03:37:14.270
shall have the leading ofthis foot and horse.

3903
03:37:14.270 --> 03:37:17.200
They thus directed, we willfollow in the main battle,

3904
03:37:17.200 --> 03:37:18.900
whose puissance on eitherside

3905
03:37:18.900 --> 03:37:21.430
shall be well winged withour chiefest horse.

3906
03:37:21.430 --> 03:37:23.600
This, and Saint George toboot.

3907
03:37:23.600 --> 03:37:25.200
What think'st thou,Norfolk?

3908
03:37:25.200 --> 03:37:28.330
A good direction, warlikesovereign.

3909
03:37:28.330 --> 03:37:31.000
This I found on my tentthis morning.

3910
03:37:32.530 --> 03:37:34.930
"Jockey of Norfolk, be notso bold,

3911
03:37:34.930 --> 03:37:38.000
for Dickon, thy master, isbought and sold."

3912
03:37:43.400 --> 03:37:45.430
A thing devised by theenemy.

3913
03:37:45.430 --> 03:37:48.230
Go, gentleman, every manunto his charge.

3914
03:37:51.270 --> 03:37:53.830
Let not our babblingdreams affright our souls.

3915
03:37:53.830 --> 03:37:56.170
Conscience is but a wordthat cowards use,

3916
03:37:56.170 --> 03:37:58.600
devised at first to keepthe strong in awe.

3917
03:37:58.600 --> 03:38:02.200
Our strong arms be ourconscience, swords our law.

3918
03:38:02.200 --> 03:38:04.070
March on; join bravely.

3919
03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:06.030
Let us to it pell-mell,

3920
03:38:06.030 --> 03:38:09.500
if not to heaven, thenhand in hand to Hell.

3921
03:38:13.230 --> 03:38:16.230
What shall I say more thanI have inferred?

3922
03:38:16.230 --> 03:38:18.700
Remember whom you are tocope withal:

3923
03:38:18.700 --> 03:38:22.100
a sort of vagabonds,rascals, and runaways,

3924
03:38:22.100 --> 03:38:25.500
a scum of Bretons and baselackey peasants,

3925
03:38:25.500 --> 03:38:28.300
whom their o'ercloyedcountry vomits forth

3926
03:38:28.300 --> 03:38:31.230
to desperate adventuresand assured destruction.

3927
03:38:31.230 --> 03:38:34.970
You sleeping safe, theybring to you unrest.

3928
03:38:34.970 --> 03:38:38.230
You having lands and blestwith beauteous wives,

3929
03:38:38.230 --> 03:38:41.730
they would restrain theone, disdain the other.

3930
03:38:41.730 --> 03:38:44.800
And who doth lead them buta paltry fellow,

3931
03:38:44.800 --> 03:38:47.500
a milksop, one that neverin his life

3932
03:38:47.500 --> 03:38:50.430
felt so much cold asovershoes in snow?

3933
03:38:51.130 --> 03:38:54.430
Let's whip these stragglerso'er the seas again.

3934
03:38:54.430 --> 03:38:57.530
Lash hence theseoverweening rags of France,

3935
03:38:57.530 --> 03:39:00.270
these famished beggars,weary of their lives,

3936
03:39:00.270 --> 03:39:03.430
who, but for dreaming onthis fond exploit,

3937
03:39:03.430 --> 03:39:06.400
for want of means, poorrats, had hanged themselves.

3938
03:39:07.530 --> 03:39:10.800
If we be conquered, letmen conquer us,

3939
03:39:10.800 --> 03:39:12.870
and not these bastardBretons,

3940
03:39:12.870 --> 03:39:14.870
whom our fathers have intheir own lands

3941
03:39:14.870 --> 03:39:16.570
beaten, bobbed, andthumped,

3942
03:39:16.570 --> 03:39:19.170
and in record, left themthe heirs of shame.

3943
03:39:19.170 --> 03:39:21.800
Shall these enjoy ourlands?

3944
03:39:21.800 --> 03:39:23.330
Lie with our wives?

3945
03:39:23.330 --> 03:39:24.530
Ravish our daughters?

3946
03:39:24.530 --> 03:39:26.630
No!

3947
03:39:26.630 --> 03:39:27.430
Hark. I hear their drum.

3948
03:39:27.430 --> 03:39:29.230
Fight, gentlemen ofEngland.

3949
03:39:29.230 --> 03:39:30.700
Fight, bold yeomen.

3950
03:39:30.700 --> 03:39:33.470
Draw, archers, draw yourarrows to the head.

3951
03:39:33.470 --> 03:39:36.830
Spur your proud horseshard, and ride in blood.

3952
03:39:36.830 --> 03:39:39.770
Amaze the welkin with yourbroken staves.

3953
03:39:39.770 --> 03:39:41.830
What says Lord Stanley?Will he bring his power?

3954
03:39:41.830 --> 03:39:43.270
My lord, he doth deny tocome.

3955
03:39:43.270 --> 03:39:45.070
Off with his son George'shead!

3956
03:39:45.070 --> 03:39:47.230
My lord, the enemy is pastthe marsh!

3957
03:39:47.230 --> 03:39:49.770
After the battle, letGeorge Stanley die.

3958
03:39:49.770 --> 03:39:52.230
A thousand hearts aregreat within my bosom.

3959
03:39:52.230 --> 03:39:54.030
Advance our standards.

3960
03:39:54.030 --> 03:39:55.500
Set upon our foes.

3961
03:39:55.500 --> 03:39:58.230
Our ancient word ofcourage, fair Saint George,

3962
03:39:58.230 --> 03:40:01.430
inspire us with the spleenof fiery dragons.

3963
03:40:01.430 --> 03:40:02.830
Upon them!

3964
03:40:02.830 --> 03:40:06.630
Victory sits on our helms!

3965
03:40:09.530 --> 03:40:10.670
Rescue.

3966
03:40:10.670 --> 03:40:13.100
My Lord of Norfolk,rescue, rescue!

3967
03:40:13.100 --> 03:40:15.230
The king enacts morewonders than a man,

3968
03:40:15.230 --> 03:40:17.570
daring an opposite toevery danger.

3969
03:40:17.570 --> 03:40:22.230
His horse is slain, andall on foot he fights,

3970
03:40:22.230 --> 03:40:25.330
seeking for Richmond inthe throat of death!

3971
03:40:25.330 --> 03:40:29.970
Rescue, fair lord, or elsethe day is lost!

3972
03:40:29.970 --> 03:40:33.230
A horse! A horse! Mykingdom for a horse!

3973
03:40:33.230 --> 03:40:34.230
Withdraw, my lord.

3974
03:40:34.230 --> 03:40:35.400
I'll help you to a horse.

3975
03:40:35.400 --> 03:40:36.670
Slave!

3976
03:40:36.670 --> 03:40:38.630
I'll set my life upon acast,

3977
03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:41.170
and I will stand thehazard of the die.

3978
03:40:41.170 --> 03:40:43.730
I think there be sixRichmonds in the field.

3979
03:40:43.730 --> 03:40:46.270
Five have I slain todayinstead of him.

3980
03:40:46.270 --> 03:40:48.470
A horse! A horse!

3981
03:40:48.470 --> 03:40:49.970
My kingdom for a horse!

3982
03:40:49.970 --> 03:40:51.330
Richard!

3983
03:40:51.330 --> 03:40:53.770
For Richmond!

3984
03:40:57.170 --> 03:40:58.930
For Richmond!

3985
03:41:02.170 --> 03:41:03.500
Richmond!

3986
03:41:21.930 --> 03:41:23.930
For Richmond!

3987
03:42:56.270 --> 03:42:58.470
God and your arms bepraised, victorious friends.

3988
03:42:58.470 --> 03:43:01.870
The day is ours.

3989
03:43:01.870 --> 03:43:03.930
The bloody dog is dead.

3990
03:43:15.030 --> 03:43:18.430
Courageous Richmond, wellhast thou acquit thee.

3991
03:43:20.500 --> 03:43:23.770
Lo, here, thislong-usurped royalty.

3992
03:43:23.770 --> 03:43:28.000
Wear it, enjoy it, andmake much of it.

3993
03:43:33.470 --> 03:43:35.770
Great God of Heaven, sayAmen to all.

3994
03:43:46.700 --> 03:43:49.270
But, tell me, is youngGeorge Stanley living?

3995
03:43:49.270 --> 03:43:52.130
He is, my lord, and safein Leicester town,

3996
03:43:52.130 --> 03:43:54.330
whither, if it please you,we will now withdraw us.

3997
03:43:54.330 --> 03:43:56.500
Proclaim a pardon to thesoldiers fled

3998
03:43:56.500 --> 03:43:58.870
that in submission willreturn to us.

3999
03:44:03.930 --> 03:44:06.270
And then, as we have ta'enthe sacrament,

4000
03:44:06.270 --> 03:44:09.200
we will unite the whiterose and the red.

4001
03:44:10.570 --> 03:44:13.230
Smile, Heaven, upon thisfair conjunction

4002
03:44:13.230 --> 03:44:15.370
that long have frownedupon their enmity.

4003
03:44:18.470 --> 03:44:21.800
What traitor hears me andsays not Amen?

4004
03:44:21.800 --> 03:44:23.500
Amen.

4005
03:44:29.930 --> 03:44:33.730
England hath long been madand scarred herself.

4006
03:44:33.730 --> 03:44:37.670
The brother blindly shedthe brother's blood,

4007
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:40.130
the father rashlyslaughtered his own son,

4008
03:44:40.130 --> 03:44:44.130
the son, compelled, beenbutcher to the sire.

4009
03:44:44.130 --> 03:44:47.670
All this divided York andLancaster,

4010
03:44:47.670 --> 03:44:49.630
delighted in their diredivision.

4011
03:44:58.570 --> 03:45:00.870
O, now let Richmond andElizabeth,

4012
03:45:00.870 --> 03:45:03.500
the true succeeders ofeach royal house,

4013
03:45:03.500 --> 03:45:07.470
by God's fair ordinanceconjoin together.

4014
03:45:07.470 --> 03:45:10.330
And let their heirs, God,if thy will be so,

4015
03:45:10.330 --> 03:45:13.500
enrich the time to comewith smooth-faced peace,

4016
03:45:13.500 --> 03:45:17.070
with smiling plenty, andfair prosperous days.

4017
03:45:18.700 --> 03:45:20.970
Abate the edge oftraitors, gracious Lord,

4018
03:45:20.970 --> 03:45:23.300
that would reduce thesebloody days again

4019
03:45:23.300 --> 03:45:26.800
