00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.530


2
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.630
Now sleep y-slaked haththe rout;

3
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.300
No din but snores thehouse about,

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.400
Made louder by theo'er-fed breast

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.030
Of this most pompousmarriage-feast.

6
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.630
The cat, with eyne ofburning coal,

7
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.900
Now crouches fore themouse's hole;

8
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.270
And crickets sing at theoven's mouth,

9
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.830
E'er the blither for theirdrouth.

10
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.200
Hymen hath brought thebride to bed.

11
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.230
Where, by the loss ofmaidenhead,

12
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.300
A babe is moulded. Beattent,

13
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.970
And time that is sobriefly spent

14
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.370
With your fine fanciesquaintly eche:

15
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.470
What's dumb in show I'llplain with speech.

16
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.830
By many a dern and painfulperch

17
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.870
Of Pericles the carefulsearch,

18
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.430
By the four opposingcoigns

19
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.130
Which the world togetherjoins,

20
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.130
Is made with all duediligence

21
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.430
That horse and sail andhigh expense

22
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.500
Can stead the quest. Atlast from Tyre,

23
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.430
Fame answering the moststrange inquire,

24
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.800
To the court of KingSimonides

25
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.700
Are letters brought, thetenor these:

26
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.100
Antiochus and his daughterdead;

27
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.400
The men of Tyrus on thehead

28
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.930
Of Helicanus would set on

29
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.330
The crown of Tyre, but hewill none:

30
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.400
The mutiny he there hastest' oppress;

31
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.600
Says to 'em, if KingPericles

32
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.030
Come not home in twice sixmoons,

33
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.670
He, obedient to theirdooms,

34
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.900
Will take the crown. Thesum of this,

35
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.400
Brought hither toPentapolis,

36
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.130
Y-ravished the regionsround,

37
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.070
And every one with clapscan sound,

38
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.030
'Our heir-apparent is aking!

39
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.100
Who dream'd, who thoughtof such a thing?'

40
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.030
Brief, he must hencedepart to Tyre:

41
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.500
His queen with child makesher desire--

42
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.730
Which who shallcross?--along to go:

43
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.300
Omit we all their dole andwoe:

44
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.930
Lychorida, her nurse, shetakes,

45
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.230
And so to sea.

46
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.600
Their vessel shakes on Neptune'sbillow; half the flood

47
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.070
Hath their keel cut: butfortune's mood

48
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.270
Varies again; the grislynorth

49
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.000
Disgorges such a tempestforth,

50
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.270
That, as a duck for lifethat dives,

51
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.400
So up and down the poorship drives:

52
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.030
The lady shrieks, andwell-a-near

53
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.970
Does fall in travail withher fear:

54
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.600
And what ensues in thisfell storm

55
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.800
Shall for itself itselfperform.

56
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.500
I nill relate, action may

57
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.970
Conveniently the restconvey;

58
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.630
Which might not what by meis told.

59
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.730
In your imagination hold

60
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.370
This stage the ship, uponwhose deck

61
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.170
The sea-tost Periclesappears to speak.

62
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.730
Thou god of this greatvast, rebuke these surges,

63
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.130
Which wash both heaven andhell; and thou, that hast

64
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.830
Upon the winds command,bind them in brass,

65
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.130
Having call'd themfrom the deep!

66
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.270
O, still thy deafening,dreadful thunders;

67
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.300
gently quench thy nimble,sulphurous flashes!

68
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.400
O, how, Lychorida,How does my queen?

69
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.170
Thou stormest venomously;

70
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.330
Wilt thou spit all thyself?The seaman's whistle

71
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.570
Is as a whisper in theears of death,

72
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:46.100
Unheard. Lychorida!--Lucina,

73
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.170
O Divinest patroness,and midwife gentle

74
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.870
To those that cry bynight, convey thy deity

75
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.170
Aboard our dancing boat;make swift the pangs

76
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.200
Of my queen's travails!

77
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.430
Here is a thing too youngfor such a place,

78
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.230
Who, if it hadconceit, would die,

79
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.100
as I am like to do: takein your arms this piece

80
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.100
Of your dead queen.

81
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.070
How, how, Lychorida!

82
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.230
Patience, good sir; do notassist the storm.

83
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.300
Here's all that is leftliving of your queen,

84
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.230
A little daughter: for thesake of it,

85
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.930
Be manly, and takecomfort.

86
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.370
O you gods!

87
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.800
Why do you make us loveyour goodly gifts,

88
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.870
And snatch them straightaway? We here below

89
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.970
Recall not what we give,and therein may

90
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.800
Use honour with you.

91
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.270
Patience, good sir,

92
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.500
Even for this charge.

93
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.430
Now, mild may be thy life!

94
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.370
For a more blustrous birthhad never babe:

95
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.330
Quiet and gentlethy conditions!

96
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.070
for thou art the rudeliestwelcome to this world

97
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.670
That ever was prince'schild. Happy what follows!

98
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.430
Thou hast as chiding anativity

99
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.070
As fire, air, water, earth,and heaven can make,

100
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.670
To herald thee from the womb:poor itch of nature

101
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.000
even at the first thy loss ismore than can thy portage quit,

102
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.230
With all thou canst findhere. Now, the good gods

103
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.770
Throw their best eyesupon't!

104
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.800
What courage, sir? Godsave you!

105
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.270
Courage enough: I do notfear the flaw;

106
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.270
It hath done to me theworst. Yet, for the love

107
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:32.770
Of this poor infant, thisfresh-new sea-farer,

108
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.230
I would it would be quiet.

109
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.570
Slack the bolins there!Thou wilt not, wilt thou?

110
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.730
Blow, and split thyself.

111
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:51.170
But sea-room, an the brine andcloudy billow kiss the moon,

112
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.100
I care not.

113
00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.600
Sir, your queen mustoverboard: the sea works high,

114
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.830
the wind is loud, and willnot lie till the ship be

115
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.670
cleared of the dead.

116
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.470
That's your superstition.

117
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.230
Pardon us, sir; with us at seait hath been still observed:

118
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.230
and we are strong in custom.

119
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:18.230
Therefore briefly yield her; forshe must overboard straight.

120
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:24.930
As you think meet. Mostwretched queen!

121
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.700
Here she lies, sir.

122
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.170
A terrible childbed hastthou had, my dear;

123
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.600
No light, no fire: theunfriendly elements

124
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.630
Forgot thee utterly: norhave I time

125
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.500
To give thee hallow'd tothy grave, but straight

126
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.530
Must cast thee, scarcelycoffin'd, in the ooze;

127
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.630
Where, for a monument uponthy bones,

128
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.870
And e'er-remaining lamps,the belching whale

129
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.870
And humming water musto'erwhelm thy corpse,

130
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.100
Lying with simple shells.

131
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.200
O Lychorida,

132
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.830
Bid Nestor bring mespices, ink and paper,

133
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.130
My casket and my jewels;and bid Nicander

134
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:43.600
Bring me the satin coffer: laythe babe upon the pillow:

135
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.230
hie thee, whiles I say

136
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:51.470
A priestly farewell toher: suddenly, woman.

137
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.200
Sir, we have a chestbeneath the hatches,

138
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.000
caulked and bitumed ready.

139
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.200
I thank thee. Mariner, saywhat coast is this?

140
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.800
We are near Tarsus.

141
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.400
Thither, gentle mariner.

142
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.570
Alter thy course for Tyre.When canst thou reach it?

143
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.630
By break of day, if thewind cease.

144
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.300
O, make for Tarsus!

145
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.300
There will I visit Cleon,for the babe

146
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.470
Cannot hold out to Tyrus:

147
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:32.070
there I'll leave itat careful nursing.

148
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.830
Go thy ways, good mariner:

149
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.230
I'll bring the bodypresently.

150
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:20.030
Philemon, ho!

151
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.400
Doth my lord call?

152
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.830
Get fire and meat forthese poor men:

153
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.430
'T has been a turbulentand stormy night.

154
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.200
I have been in many; butsuch a night as this,

155
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.000
Till now, I ne'er endured.

156
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.770
Your master will be deadere you return;

157
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.370
There's nothing can beminister'd to nature

158
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.930
That can recover him.

159
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:03.100
Give this to the'pothecary,

160
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:08.230
And tell me how it works.

161
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.670
Good morrow.

162
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.870
Good morrow to yourlordship.

163
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:22.700
Gentlemen,

164
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.670
Why do you stir so early?

165
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.970
Sir,

166
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.030
Our lodgings, standingbleak upon the sea,

167
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.570
Shook as the earth didquake;

168
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.830
The very principals didseem to rend,

169
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.600
And all-to topple: puresurprise and fear

170
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.230
Made me to quit the house.

171
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.370
That is the cause wetrouble you so early;

172
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.970
'Tis not our husbandry.

173
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.470
O, you say well.

174
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.130
But I much marvel thatyour lordship, having

175
00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:48.070
Rich tire about you, shouldat these early hours

176
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:50.530
Shake off the goldenslumber of repose.

177
00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:51.670
'Tis most strange,

178
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.470
Nature should be soconversant with pain,

179
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.970
Being thereto notcompell'd.

180
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:55.900
I hold it ever,

181
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.970
Virtue and cunning wereendowments greater

182
00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:02.130
Than nobleness and riches:careless heirs

183
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.130
May the two latter darkenand expend;

184
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.500
But immortality attendsthe former.

185
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.470
Making a man a god. 'Tis known,

186
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.630
I ever have studied physic,through which secret art,

187
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:19.600
By turning o'erauthorities, I have,

188
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.300
Together with my practise,made familiar

189
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.670
To me and to my aid theblest infusions

190
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:30.470
That dwell in vegetives,in metals, stones;

191
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:31.970
And I can speak of thedisturbances

192
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.930
That nature works, and of hercures; which doth give me

193
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.970
A more content in courseof true delight

194
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:41.500
Than to be thirsty aftertottering honour,

195
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.630
Or tie my treasure up insilken bags,

196
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.130
To please the fool anddeath.

197
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.530
Your honour has throughEphesus pour'd forth

198
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.900
Your charity, and hundredscall themselves

199
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.630
Your creatures, who by youhave been restored:

200
00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.800
And not your knowledge,your personal pain,

201
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.070
but even your purse, stillopen, hath built Lord Cerimon

202
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.470
Such strong renown astime shall ne'er raise.

203
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.830
So; lift there.

204
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.200
What is that?

205
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.630
Sir, even now did the sea tossupon our shore this chest:

206
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.200
'Tis of some wreck.

207
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.230
Set 't down, let's lookupon't.

208
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.130
'Tis like a coffin, sir.

209
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.300
Whate'er it be, 'Tiswondrous heavy.

210
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.170
Wrench it open straight:

211
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.330
If the sea's stomach beo'ercharged with gold,

212
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.300
'Tis a good constraint offortune it belches upon us.

213
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.070
'Tis so, my lord.

214
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.530
How close 'tis caulk'd andbitumed!

215
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.500
Did the sea cast it up?

216
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.330
I never saw so huge abillow, sir,

217
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.370
As toss'd it upon shore.

218
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.500
Wrench it open;

219
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:57.470
Soft! it smells mostsweetly in my sense.

220
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:58.970
A delicate odour.

221
00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:04.330
As ever hit my nostril.So, up with it.

222
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:16.930
O you most potent gods!what's here? a corse!

223
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.570
Most strange!

224
00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:24.770
Shrouded in cloth of state;balm'd and entreasured

225
00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:30.700
With full bags of spices!A passport too!

226
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:39.170
Apollo, perfect me in thecharacters!

227
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:42.400
'Here I give tounderstand,

228
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.930
If e'er this coffin drivea-land,

229
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.670
I, King Pericles, havelost this queen,

230
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.630
worth all our mundane cost.

231
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.500
Who finds her, give herburying;

232
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.330
She was the daughter of aking:

233
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.570
Besides this treasure fora fee,

234
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.200
The gods requite hischarity!'

235
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.130
O Pericles, If thou livest,thou hast a heart

236
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:18.900
That even cracks for woe!This chanced tonight.

237
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:19.870
Most likely, sir.

238
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.870
Nay, certainly to-night;

239
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:28.200
For look how fresh shelooks! They were too rough

240
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.000
That threw her in the sea.Make a fire within:

241
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.270
Fetch hither all my boxesin my closet.

242
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.500
Death may usurp on naturemany hours,

243
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.630
And yet the fire of lifekindle again

244
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.830
The o'erpress'd spirits. Iread of some Egyptians

245
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.730
Who after four hourse death,have raised impoverished spirits

246
00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:55.230
Like to this, unto their formerheatlh.

247
00:15:55.230 --> 00:16:01.870
Well said, well said; thefire and cloths.

248
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:05.470
The rough and woeful musicthat we have,

249
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.530
Cause it to sound, beseechyou.

250
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.070
The viol once more:

251
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:45.330
how thou stirr'st, thou block!

252
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:50.430
The music there!--I prayyou, give her air.

253
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.030
Gentlemen.

254
00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:58.470
This queen will live:nature awakes; a warmth

255
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.230
Breathes out of her: shehath not been entranced

256
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:05.670
Above five hours: see howshe gins to blow

257
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.670
Into life's flower again!

258
00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.370
The heavens, Through you,increase our wonder

259
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.270
and set up your fame forever.

260
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.800
She is alive; behold,

261
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.270
Her eyelids, cases tothose heavenly jewels

262
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.800
Which Pericles hath lost,

263
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:25.500
Begin to part theirfringes of bright gold;

264
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.430
The diamonds of a mostpraised water

265
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:32.330
Doth appear, to makethe world twice rich.

266
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:37.830
Live, and make us weep to hearyour fate, fair creature,

267
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:41.030
Rare as you seem to be.

268
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.300
O dear Diana,

269
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:13.200
Where am I? Where's mylord? What world is this?

270
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.400
Is not this strange?

271
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.270
Most rare.

272
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:17.730
Hush, my gentleneighbours!

273
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.470
Lend me your hands; to thenext chamber bear her.

274
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.330
Get linen: now this mattermust be look'd to,

275
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:28.800
For her relapse is mortal.Come, come;

276
00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:35.670
And AEsculapius guide us!

277
00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:16.530
Most honour'd Cleon, Imust needs be gone;

278
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.330
My twelve months areexpired, and Tyrus stands

279
00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.830
In a litigious peace. You,and your lady,

280
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.230
Take from my heartall thankfulness!

281
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.030
The gods make upthe rest upon you!

282
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.000
Your strokes of fortune, thoughthey hurt you mortally,

283
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.900
Yet glance fullwoundingly on us.

284
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.670
O your sweet queen! That thestrict fates had pleased you

285
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:34.700
had brought her hither,

286
00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.830
To have bless'd mine eyeswith her!

287
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.770
We cannot but obeythe powers above us.

288
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:44.770
Could I rage and roar as doth the sea she lies in,

289
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.300
yet the end must be as 'tis.

290
00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.400
My gentle babe Marina, whom,

291
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.300
For she was born atsea, I have named so,

292
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.530
here I charge yourcharity withal,

293
00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.700
leaving her the infant ofyour care; beseeching you

294
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.530
To give her princelytraining, that she may be

295
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:09.900
Manner'd as she is born.

296
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.300
Fear not, my lord, butthink

297
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.670
Your grace, that fed mycountry with your corn,

298
00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:17.200
For which the people'sprayers still fall upon you,

299
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.670
Must in your childbe thought on.

300
00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:23.070
If neglection should thereinmake me vile, the common body,

301
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.600
By you relieved, wouldforce me to my duty:

302
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.500
But if to that my natureneed a spur,

303
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.400
The gods revenge it uponme and mine,

304
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.100
To the end of generation!

305
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.530
I believe you;

306
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.230
Your honour and yourgoodness teach me to't,

307
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:43.630
Without your vows. Tillshe be married, madam,

308
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.030
By bright Diana,whom we honour,

309
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:50.270
all unscissor'd shall thishair of mine remain,

310
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:57.400
Though I show ill in't. SoI take my leave.

311
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.330
Good madam, make meblessed in your care

312
00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:04.470
In bringing up my child.

313
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:05.630
I have one myself,

314
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:08.130
Who shall not be more dearto my respect

315
00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:09.870
Than yours, my lord.

316
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.470
Madam, my thanks andprayers.

317
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.430
We'll bring your grace e'ento the edge o' the shore,

318
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:18.400
Then give you up tothe mask'd Neptune

319
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.270
and the gentlestwinds of heaven.

320
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:21.430
I will embrace your offer.

321
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:26.200
Come, dearest madam. O, notears, Lychorida, no tears:

322
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.800
Look to your littlemistress, on whose grace

323
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:34.230
You may depend hereafter.Come, my lord.

324
00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:20.730
Madam, this letter, andsome certain jewels,

325
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:21.470
Lay with you in your coffer:

326
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.600
which are now at your command.

327
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:30.670
Know you the character?It is my lord's.

328
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.830
That I was shipp'd at sea,I well remember,

329
00:24:54.830 --> 00:25:00.230
Even on my eaning time; butwhether there deliver'd,

330
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.930
by the holy gods, Icannot rightly say.

331
00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.200
But since King Pericles,

332
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.470
My wedded lord, I ne'ershall see again,

333
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:26.270
A vestal livery will Itake me to,

334
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.930
And never more have joy.

335
00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:32.200
Madam, if this you purposeas ye speak,

336
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.000
Diana's temple is notdistant far,

337
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.970
Where you may abide tillyour date expire.

338
00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:43.500
Moreover, if you please, aniece of mine

339
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.030
Shall there attend you.

340
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.500
My recompense is thanks,that's all;

341
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.600
Yet my good will is great,though the gift small.

342
00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.730
