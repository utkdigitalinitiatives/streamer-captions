00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.760
NARRATOR: Humans...

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.230
Without a doubt, the
smartest animal on earth.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.860
Yet we're unmistakably
tied to our ape origins.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.260
Millions of years ago,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.160
we were apes, living
ape lives in Africa.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.700
So how did we get from that...

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.800
to this?

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.460
What happened?

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.230
What set us on the
path to humanity?

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.160
The questions are huge.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.300
But at last,
there are answers.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.430
More than six million years
ago we took that first step

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.860
to separate from the apes.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.960
DON JOHANSON: We see the
launching of the career

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.500
that ultimately led
to Homo sapiens.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.500
NARRATOR: And three
million years ago, we see
the roots of our big brain

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.530
begin to take hold
in a tiny creature

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.600
more like a chimp than a human.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.460
PETER deMENOCAL: The
frontier of human evolution

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.500
is really being brought
to this razor sharp edge.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.000
NARRATOR: And we now know
that for millions of years,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.100
many different humanlike
species lived together

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.360
on the planet until one
day there was only us,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.900
Homo sapiens,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.330
the most complex,
adaptable animal on earth.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.160
So how did we get
this way, and why?

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.360
A radical new theory reveals how
episodes of cataclysmic change

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.900
forced our ancestors
to adapt or die.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.230
MARK MASLIN: I think
we should actually look
to our proud ancestry

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.760
and how we evolved in
East Africa and say,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.500
That's how we survived that.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.030
We can survive the future.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.060
NARRATOR: So get ready for a
ride through millions of years

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.560
of our history.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.930
Its the story of becoming
human-- our story--

00:01:49.930 --> 00:02:06.830
right now, on NOVA.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.460
Major funding for NOVA is
provided by the following:

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.330
ExxonMobil,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.130
taking on the worlds
toughest energy challenges.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.230
And by:

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:32.400
And...

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.530
And by the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting

00:02:35.530 --> 00:03:02.930
and by contributions to
your PBS station from:

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.560
NARRATOR: Millions of years
ago, on the plains of Africa,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.430
a momentous event took place.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.530
Apes that had walked on four
legs stood up and walked on two.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.900
Eventually, this
change in posture

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.530
would be followed by a
change in their brains.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:32.660
Somehow, over time,
they would become us.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.900
We know it happened, but we've
never known when or why.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.400
Until now.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.430
In the Sahara desert, a
six-million-year-old fossil

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.530
called Toumai may
hold the secret

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.960
of how we first walked upright.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.300
(translated): We are
writing the first chapter
of human evolution.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.860
We are very close
to the beginning.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.100
Very close.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.300
NARRATOR: And the
fossilized bones of a child

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.030
from three-and-a-half
million years ago,

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.700
hint to us about the
beginnings of human thought.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.800
Were discovering how many
different human species

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:23.700
lived on earth at the same time
and why all but one died out.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.360
We, Homo sapiens, are the
first ever to be alone.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.300
So what powered our evolution?

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.960
Why did we become human?

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.960
Scientists are scouring the
most remote parts of Africa

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.960
for clues.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.030
The search for answers
begins here, in the Afar--

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.730
northeastern Ethiopia.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.200
Its part of the Great Rift
Valley, a deep cut in the earth

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:03.660
where geologic forces are
ripping Africa apart.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.960
Millions of years of history
are brought to the surface

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.660
in layers of exposed rock.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.560
Its hot and desolate.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.260
Dangerous, too.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.330
Ancient rivalries and modern
weapons have turned the Afar

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.330
into a no-mans-land
of simmering conflict.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.860
But Zeray Alemseged has
made this forbidding place

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.060
his life's work.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.030
Hes searching for
the fossilized traces

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:48.660
of our earliest human ancestors.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.230
The fossil bones of animals
like antelopes, elephants

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.630
and pigs are abundant.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:02.300
But the fossils of our
ancestors are extremely rare.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.730
Then, in a stroke of
luck, Zeray makes the
find of a lifetime,

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.700
a find that illuminates our
origins in a unique way.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.460
ALEMSEGED: On that
afternoon, we decided
to survey this hillside

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.960
and the first thing that
was spotted was a cheekbone

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.630
of the face.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.160
NARRATOR: It was a face so
tiny it had to be a baby.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:37.660
But not a baby chimp; he could
tell that from its shape.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.430
The skull was
embedded in sandstone,

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.360
but as Zeray turned it over, he
could see more bones inside.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.360
ALEMSEGED: Everything
was squashed

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.860
against the base of the skull

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.760
and completely covered
by the sandstone block.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.600
NARRATOR: Clues to
the age of the fossil

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.800
came from a distinctive
feature in the landscape--

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:06.260
white bands of volcanic ash.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:12.730
That is volcanic ash, dated
to 3.4 million years ago.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.160
NARRATOR: If the volcanic ash
is 3.4 million years old,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.330
Zerays fossil, which
was lying just above it,

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.330
must be younger.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.230
It was a child from the
dawn of human evolution,

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:33.000
about 3.3 million years ago.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:44.760
Zeray called the baby Selam,
the Ethiopian word for peace.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.460
Then he set off on a quest to
unravel her many mysteries.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:57.830
Her journey began a
very, very long time ago.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.830
Imagine the entire span
of recorded human history

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.130
taking us back to the
Egyptian pyramids,

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.730
about 5,000 years.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.460
Double it-- 10,000 years ago--

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:14.430
when plants were domesticated
and agriculture begins.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.330
Double it again, to the
time when Ice Age hunters

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:23.030
paint stunning
images on cave walls.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:27.360
And keep doubling
six more times,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.860
taking us back
1.3 million years,

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.630
when the first creature
who really looked like us

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.530
hunted on the plains of Africa
and then keep traveling back

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.330
another two million years

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.100
and only then do we arrive
in the time when Selam lived

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:52.860
in Ethiopia nearly three-
and-a-half million years ago.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.760
What were Selam and
her family like?

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.330
What kind of world
did they live in?

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:08.560
The answers are hidden
in their fossil bones.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:14.260
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.430
Zeray's home.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.200
He is one of a whole new
generation of African scientists

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:26.560
trying to unravel the
mysteries of human origins.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.230
Zeray has brought his
precious fossil here

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:32.200
to the National Museum.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.460
His challenge is to release
her from the tomb of sandstone

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.630
in which her bones are encased.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.230
He quickly identifies her.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.630
She is from a species
considered by most scientists

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:49.960
to be an ancient ancestor.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.800
Australopithecus afarensis.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.460
A small, chimplike creature
who walked on two legs.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.960
This is the same species
as the famous Lucy

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.360
discovered in the
1970s by Don Johanson.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.200
JOHANSON: Lucy was terribly
important because she was really

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.960
an amalgam of different
characteristics

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.960
of ape and human.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.530
ALEMSEGED: I think specimens
like Selam and Lucy are

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:20.360
extraordinary simply because
you can look at them and see

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.860
evolution in the making.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.730
NARRATOR: But seeing
evolution in the making
will take some work.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.460
Selam's fossilized
bones are solid rock

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:39.360
held together by a
mesh of soft sandstone.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:45.830
It has to be
painstakingly removed.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.730
ALEMSEGED: We spent
hours, hours and hours and
days and years and years

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.930
and I removed the sand
grains, grain by grain,

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:56.230
working every day.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:00.400
NARRATOR: Hes been at
it for eight long years,

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.000
but the payoff has been amazing.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.560
As the work progressed,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:13.000
Zeray revealed an almost
complete skull...

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.500
and tucked beneath it was
nearly her entire spine,

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.900
along with both shoulder blades.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:25.230
Other bones were found nearby.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.230
ALEMSEGED: An almost
complete foot.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.300
This is the kneecap.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:36.230
The tibia here.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.160
NARRATOR: Never before had a
childs skeleton been found

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.830
so ancient and so complete.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.430
Her bones would
fit in a shoebox,

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.930
but they speak volumes
about her life.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:52.930
For example, to find out how
old she was when she died,

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.330
Zeray looked at her teeth.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.260
But not the baby teeth
visible in her jaw...

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:06.830
the adult teeth growing inside
the bone as seen in a CT scan.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:15.000
From that, we know
Selam died at age three.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.560
Like Lucy, she testifies to a
crucial step in our evolution.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.860
Unlike apes, these
creatures walked upright,

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:30.060
as the first fossil Don Johanson
found clearly revealed.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.530
JOHANSON: It was sticking
out of the ground like that.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.530
And I gently tapped
it with my sneaker

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.600
and this is what fell
out of the ground.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:43.060
And it is the... this is your...
the top end of your shinbone.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.100
So the kneecap would
sit right in here.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.130
And very close by in two
pieces I found this bone.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.500
And when you put them together

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.730
and you see how they
move and articulate,

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:59.700
it has all the hallmarks
of an upright person.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:04.300
NARRATOR: Other bones
confirm that Lucy walked
on two legs like us.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.500
JOHANSON: This is Lucy's pelvis.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:11.130
And you can see how
different a chimpanzee is.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.260
And the reorientation
of these hip bones--

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.960
in a chimp theyre facing
straight forward.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.430
So here is... this is what
everybody is sitting on

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.000
in their living room right now.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.430
So theyre not identical,

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.100
but clearly these two
resemble each other

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.060
much more closely, right,
than either one of these

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:40.300
resembles the pelvis of an ape.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.200
NARRATOR: From the waist
down, Lucy was like us.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:49.560
From the waist up, she
and her kind were all ape.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:54.800
Selams skeleton is the same,
with chimplike shoulder blades

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.700
giving her the range of motion

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:01.630
needed for climbing
and swinging.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:06.000
These ancient creatures must
have spent time in the trees,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.030
possibly sleeping
there at night to keep
away from predators,

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:17.200
but walking upright on the
ground during the day.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.330
They were at home in two worlds.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:29.830
What was their environment like?

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.230
It must have been very different

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.200
from the Great Rift
Valley of today.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.330
Across the border in Kenya

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.230
is one of the hottest and
most barren places on earth,

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:48.900
a vast expanse of volcanic
rock and burning desert.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.330
Thats how it is now.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.000
But theres good evidence

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.000
that for most of its history
it was very different.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.960
Researchers braving
temperatures over 100 degrees

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.630
are seeing signs of a
dramatic transformation

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:14.360
here in the Suguta Valley.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.100
YANNICK GARDIN: The
Suguta Valley was entirely
covered in water,

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.360
up to an elevation
of about 580 meters.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.500
So you can imagine
that all this valley

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.260
was filled by a huge lake.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:29.460
NARRATOR: A huge lake
thats deeper than any
of the Great Lakes.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.730
In fact, the entire African
continent used to be

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.930
a lot wetter than it is today.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:40.260
Many millions of years ago,
long before Selam and Lucy,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.160
Africa was a wet,
tropical environment

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:51.630
covered with rainforest.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:56.360
This is where the ancestors
of Selam and Lucy lived.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.960
They probably looked
a lot like chimps.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:09.160
But then, Africa started
to gradually dry out.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:15.500
The rainforest began to shrink.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.100
By Selams time, three to
four million years ago,

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.730
the Great Rift
Valley was a mosaic

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.060
of different environments.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:33.930
We know that from the fossils
of the animals that lived here.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.360
Their bones litter the ground.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.700
This is a canine
of a hippopotamus,

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.300
so this is probably the
skeleton of a hippopotamus.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:49.460
How can one find a hippo in
this type of environment?

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.360
Nice antelope here.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.460
NARRATOR: The fossils tell the
story of a vanished landscape.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:59.760
ALEMSEGED: This is the
lower jaw of an antelope.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.300
NARRATOR: Three million
years ago, the Rift
Valley was a patchwork

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:11.200
of grassy plains, scattered
woodlands, lakes and rivers.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.060
Definitely very different
from what we see here today.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.660
Wow, a nice pig here.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.960
NARRATOR: As their
environment changed,

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.660
scientists believe our
ancestors changed, too.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.430
They had been creatures

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.230
who spent most of
their time in trees,

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:34.100
like chimps and
orangutans today.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.800
But as their forests
shrank, some of them
developed the trait

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.300
that we take for granted:

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:46.560
bipedalism--
walking on two legs.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:53.500
This is one of the defining
characteristics of humans.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:58.600
But how did bipedalism
develop, and why?

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.460
BRIAN RICHMOND: Bipedalism
is such an unusual trait.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.830
Theres no other mammal

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.330
that habitually walks
on two legs like we do.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:10.600
NARRATOR: Because it's
unique, it's hard to figure
out why it happened.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:15.100
There are a lot of theories.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.300
RICHMOND: One of them
is that they stood up

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.000
to be able to see
over tall grass.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.260
Another theory-- they stood
up to be able to pick fruits

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.660
off of the low branches of trees
the way chimpanzees do today.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.700
Another theory states

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.100
that they stood up to
cool more efficiently,

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.730
so that we dont have
as much sun beating on

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.130
so much of our body.

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:40.400
DANIEL LIEBERMAN: I think
the most compelling idea,

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.460
the most compelling hypothesis,
is that it saved us energy.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:51.800
NARRATOR: And energy
is crucial to survival.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.060
Lets go back to
the dense forest,

00:18:54.060 --> 00:19:01.330
home to our ancient ape
ancestors ten million years ago.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:05.000
Like many apes today,
they were perfectly suited

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.930
to a life in the trees.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.300
LIEBERMAN: They're very
good at climbing in trees.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.200
They're phenomenal
at climbing in trees.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.360
NARRATOR: On the ground,

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.600
these ancestral apes could
probably walk on two legs

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.460
for short distances if they
had to carry something.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.630
LIEBERMAN: Fantastic climbers,
but also able to walk and run

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.900
rapidly and effectively
but not economically.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:34.330
NARRATOR: Walking was
tiring, but they didnt
have to walk far.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:35.830
LIEBERMAN: But if youre
a chimp and you only walk

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.330
two to three kilometers a day,

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.060
it doesnt really mean much,

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.430
its not going to have
that much of an effect

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.660
on your energy budget.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.660
NARRATOR: But energy
demands would change

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.860
as the forest
started to disappear.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.100
Our ape ancestors
had to walk more.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.030
LIEBERMAN: They
have to go farther

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.800
to get from one fruit patch

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.800
to another fruit
patch, for example.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.860
NARRATOR: Dan Lieberman is
an expert on bipedalism.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.860
He believes that walking
on two legs evolved

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.930
because it saved energy.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:15.530
When you compare the
energy consumption
of humans to chimps,

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:18.800
there's no contest.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.660
A chimp is an energy glutton.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.960
It spends an enormous
amount of energy--

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.130
about four times as much
energy as a human walking.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:31.830
NARRATOR: Whether it
walks on four legs...

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.960
or two...

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:40.130
a chimp can't compete
with the human gait.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:44.800
LIEBERMAN: Its poorly
designed to withstand
the forces of gravity.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.100
It has to spend a lot of
muscular effort to keep itself

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.460
from collapsing
into a little pile of
chimpness or whatever

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.030
with each step.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:56.100
NARRATOR: According
to Lieberman, small
anatomical differences

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.860
created large energy savings,

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:04.960
setting our ancestors on
the path to bipedalism,

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:14.330
a path that would
eventually lead to us.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:16.960
But first discovered,ake?
When Lucys kind were

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.500
many people thought they were
the so-called missing link

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:23.260
between apes and humans.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:29.300
But the science of genetics has
transformed our understanding

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.800
with a technique called
the molecular clock.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.930
Today, scientists
can compare DNA from
closely related species

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:41.330
to find out how long ago they
split from a common ancestor.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.100
MARK STONEKING: Its
just a very simple idea

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:48.500
that the rate of
change in DNA sequences

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.530
is more or less
constant over time.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:52.300
And thats an extraordinarily
powerful concept

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.630
because it means that you
have a way of determining

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.930
when two species last
shared a common ancestor.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:05.630
NARRATOR: Living forms
evolve because DNA sometimes
spontaneously changes

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:12.330
as it copies itself.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:17.000
These changes happen at a
surprisingly regular rate.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.360
By counting the differences
between the genetic code

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.700
of chimps and humans,
we can calculate

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:28.030
how long theyve been evolving
away from each other.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.960
The dates that one almost
always gets are around

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.600
five to seven million years ago

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.200
for when humans and chimpanzees
last shared a common ancestor.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.130
NARRATOR: Here was proof that
humans diverged from the apes

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:47.230
much earlier than we thought,
about six million years ago.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:51.330
It shows Lucy and Selam werent
one step removed from chimps

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.860
but many.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.900
They may even be closer to us

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.460
than to the first
human ancestor.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:04.300
So what came before
Lucy and Selam?

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:12.760
Who was our earliest ancestor?

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:20.260
Until the 1990s, the
fossil record was blank.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.900
Fossil hunters combed East
Africas Great Rift Valley

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.000
but could only find
small fragments

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.130
older than four million years.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:35.200
Then, in 1997, a
French anthropologist

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:41.960
called Michel Brunet decided
to look somewhere else.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.800
(Brunet speaking French)

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.200
(translated): We decided to go
to Africa, but to the west,

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.260
to the west of the Great Rift.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:58.260
NARRATOR: 1,600 miles
to the west at the edge
of the Sahara desert

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.930
in northern Chad.

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:05.230
BRUNET (translated):
Obviously, if you only go to
the field in East Africa,

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:11.000
then you are going to find
fossils only in East Africa.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.900
This was the situation.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.560
(gusty winds blow)

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:20.300
NARRATOR: Michel was
looking in a place where
the few animal fossils

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:28.630
he turned up were all around
six million years old.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:31.800
No one expected any humanlike
fossils to be found

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.460
in a layer that ancient.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.000
(translated): And
everyone said,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.030
No. There just aren't
any fossils there.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.400
NARRATOR: Michel was
not to be deterred.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.060
He was stubborn, many thought
to the point of madness.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.960
He and his team spent
years searching the desert

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.460
for signs of our ancestors.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.900
And year after year,
they came up empty.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:03.360
Then, on their 26th
expedition, in 2001,

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:09.000
they found a smashed,
misshapen skull...

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.360
around six million years old.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.630
They called it
Sahelanthropus tchadensis.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:22.930
There were no bones
apart from the skull.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:27.500
Could it be a human ancestor?
Or just another ape?

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:32.800
The skull was so deformed
it was difficult to tell.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:40.260
Michel would have
to reconstruct it.

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.430
His first step was
to take the skull,

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:45.900
now nicknamed Toumai, to
a particle accelerator

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:53.700
in Grenoble, France, to use
its powerful X-ray scanner.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.100
Over a thousand pictures
of the fossil were taken

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:01.000
to build a 3-D image
of the crushed skull.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.200
Using the virtual image,
the skull could be restored

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.500
to its original shape.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.300
It was then reproduced
by a type of 3-D printer

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.800
equipped with lasers
which harden plastic.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.660
When it finally
rose from its bath,

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:28.760
the cast of Toumais skull was
ready for detailed study.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:33.360
The cast allows Michel to
answer an important question.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.860
Did this ancient
creature walk on two legs

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:42.200
millions of years
before Lucy or Selam?

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.260
Its how the skull
connects to the spine

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:50.000
that provides the vital clue.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.330
And Michel could infer that from
the shape of Toumai's skull.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.460
If Toumais skull is set
on the neck of an ape

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:01.960
that walks on all fours,
his eyes point downward.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.230
That can't be right.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.560
Set on the upright
spine of a biped,

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.230
his eyes point straight ahead.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:15.030
For Michel, this proved
Toumai walked upright.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:18.800
(translated):
Anatomically speaking,

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.600
he had the receding
back skull of a biped.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.260
The back of his skull is
not that of a gorilla,

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.260
like some people
are trying to say.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.700
No, not at all.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.630
All you have to do is look.

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.630
NARRATOR: Some
scientists still question

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:41.530
whether Toumai was
really a biped.

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:44.860
But if Michel is right, his
six-million-year-old fossil

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:51.430
is a good candidate for
the first human ancestor.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.160
Discoveries like this
are changing the way

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:59.100
we see human evolution.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:03.300
Scientists used to
have a simple idea:

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.060
the growth of open grasslands
forced our ancestors

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.700
out of the trees.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:14.130
They became bipeds,
and in short order,
brain size increased.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:17.260
Human evolution took off.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.230
We were on our way
to becoming human.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:25.800
That simple idea prevailed
for more than a century.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.030
JOHANSON: Darwin thought
that we left the trees,

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.000
walked on the ground upright,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.630
freed our hands, made
tools, got big brains,

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:34.960
reduced our canines and so on

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.330
all at the same time.

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:40.700
NARRATOR: But walking upright
may not have automatically led

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.460
to big brains at all.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:48.900
From Toumai to Selam, both
bipeds, brains stayed small.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.700
And they weren't the only ones.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:57.300
Over millions of years there was
a profusion of upright walkers

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:02.560
with complicated names
and chimp-sized brains...

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.700
Like Orrorin tugenensis.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.500
LIEBERMAN: What were seeing
is a florescence of species,

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.100
multiple species.

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.530
They're probably subtly
different from each other.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.060
NARRATOR: Ardipithecus ramidus.

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.860
LIEBERMAN: But its
important to recognize

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.800
that there are not major
differences among these species.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.130
NARRATOR: Australopithecus
africanus.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.560
LIEBERMAN: They were
all bipeds, big snouts,

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.730
more or less chimp-sized brains.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:29.000
NARRATOR: Kenyanthropus
platyops.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.900
This way of life, this
suite of adaptations,

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.130
lasted for millions of years.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:40.060
NARRATOR: Small-brained bipedal
apes were extremely successful.

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:43.060
Debates rage among scientists

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:47.560
about which one
eventually led to us.

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:52.630
But as a group, they flourished
for about 25 times longer

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:56.660
than we've been around.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.030
They survived and thrived

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:11.200
as brain size flat-lined for
almost four million years.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:16.700
But that doesnt mean
nothing changed.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.130
Theres evidence that the seeds
of our humanity were growing

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:23.830
in these apelike creatures.

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:26.600
One key difference
between humans and apes

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:31.530
is the length of childhood.

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:34.000
But what do we know
about the childhood

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.630
of our early ancestors?

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:37.960
ALEMSEGED: We knew all about

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.100
the adult individuals,

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.500
but we didn't know much
about the children.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:47.660
NARRATOR: The brains
of baby chimps have
an early growth spurt.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:51.630
Theyre almost fully
formed by age three.

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.860
In humans that growth
spurt is slower,

00:30:54.860 --> 00:31:01.030
and it takes nearly two decades
for our brains to fully mature.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:08.360
But what about Selam's brain,
3.3 million years ago?

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:12.300
Her skull tells us
all we need to know.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:18.230
We have her milk teeth
and her adult teeth,

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:22.960
which give us her
age-- three years old.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.230
And we have a cast of
the inside of her skull,

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.860
which tells us about her brain.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.960
When you have this you
can directly measure

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:40.800
how much of the brain
was formed at age three.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.530
NARRATOR: From other
fossils, we know how large

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:48.100
Selam's brain would
have been as an adult.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:51.230
So Zeray could calculate
how much of her brain

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:57.460
was already formed by age
three, when she died.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:01.100
He knows what the answer
would be for a chimp.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.760
ALEMSEGED: By age three,
a chimpanzee would have

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.930
over 90% of the brain formed.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:12.760
NARRATOR: But Selams
brain was only around
75% of its adult size,

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:18.200
suggesting it was
growing up slower.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.860
(squeaking)

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.860
NARRATOR: Childhood would
have been her time to learn,

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:27.930
to learn the survival strategies
her family group needed

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:33.760
to live in a dangerous world.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.930
Perhaps this set the stage for
our longer human childhood,

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:45.160
when culture is handed down.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:49.160
But is there any other evidence
Selams brain was becoming

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.760
more human and less ape?

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.760
To find out, compare a
human brain to a chimp's.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.000
TODD PREUSS: This is the brain
of our closest relative,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.430
the chimpanzee brain.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:05.230
Its slightly larger
than you would expect

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.700
of a typical primate
for their body size.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.400
Not greatly so.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.560
NARRATOR: Scientists
look for clues to the
evolution of the brain

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:18.130
in the folds and
furrows on its surface.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:22.400
One important structure is
called the lunate sulcus.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.630
PREUSS: In chimpanzees
as in many primates,

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:30.530
there is this big, deep sulcus
here, the lunate sulcus.

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:35.030
NARRATOR: The lunate sulcus is a
deep furrow in a primates brain.

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:38.530
It divides parts of the
brain related to vision

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:40.860
from the rest of
the neocortex,

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.200
which is where more
complex thought happens.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:48.360
The human brain doesnt
have this deep furrow,

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.230
and the neocortex is bigger
than the vision structures,

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:56.160
which have moved
far to the back.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:00.430
So did Selam have the deep
furrow and small neocortex

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:02.360
of a chimp?

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.900
Or had something changed?

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:09.330
Brains dont fossilize, but
her remarkably complete skull

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:12.160
provides a way to see some
of the different structures

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:15.700
of her brain.

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:19.630
A cast of the brain case,
called an endocast,

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:25.000
preserves the impression
of the brain's surface.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Ralph Holloway has a collection
of 300 brain endocasts

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
from many of our ancestors.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.430
HOLLOWAY: What
a paleoneurologist like
myself will be looking for

00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:41.160
are those indications on the
endocast that might suggest

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.430
reorganization taking place.

00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:44.900
And thats why things

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:51.300
like the so-called infamous
lunate sulcus becomes important.

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.900
NARRATOR: Ralph claims that as
chimplike ancestors evolved

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.960
into creatures like
Selam and Lucy,

00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:01.360
the lunate sulcus, the furrow
marking the vision structures,

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:06.660
moved back, making room
for a larger neocortex,

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.830
the thinking part of the brain.

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:12.360
HOLLOWAY: If you
look carefully,

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.360
what youve got here
is a depression

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:19.030
that could very likely
be the lunate sulcus.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:24.360
And so that suggests, then,
by australopithecine times,

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.130
that, you know, youre having a
beast that is simply smarter

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:32.560
than present-day chimpanzees.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.130
NARRATOR: If thats the case,

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:36.500
although still the
size of a chimps,

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.300
Selam's brain had been rewired.

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:48.930
But there was a long way to go.

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:56.560
She and her kind were
still very apelike.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.460
It would take
another million years

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:03.030
for the seeds of humanity
contained in Selams tiny frame

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:08.060
to bear fruit.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.800
It's a time still
shrouded in mystery.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.160
For almost half
a million years,

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.300
the fossil record
is virtually silent.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:23.630
But in this blank period,
something is happening.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:27.030
In 2.5 million-year-old
layers,

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:31.930
scientists begin to
find something new.

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:34.600
We might be tempted
to call them rocks,

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.760
but someone was shaping them.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.930
They are the first stone tools.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:45.960
RICHMOND: The way we know
this is a tool instead
of just a broken rock

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.060
is that its broken in
a very particular way,

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.960
breaking a flake off this
way, that way, this way,

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.300
back and forth.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:58.460
So there is a method behind
how this rock was broken

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.630
in order to make
it into a tool,

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:04.100
and it's not a random method.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.700
NARRATOR: Its
considered unlikely

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:10.760
they were made by
Australopithecus, Lucys kind.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.030
RICHMOND: Australopithecus
was around

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.300
for a couple of million years
and did not make stone tools.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:21.530
NARRATOR: But if not
Lucys kind, then who?

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:26.530
The gap in the fossil record
makes it difficult to say,

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:28.500
but that's not surprising.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:35.100
Tools preserve easily,
bones much less so.

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:39.460
Finally, the skulls of a new
creature begin to turn up.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.100
Is this the toolmaker?

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:45.100
The skulls are different
from what came before.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.230
They represent the
dawn of a new era

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:53.200
beginning around two
million years ago.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:38:00.160
This is our era, the era
of the genus Homo, humans.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:04.100
The mysterious
toolmaker, Homo habilis,

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.400
is the first of
these new creatures.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.830
RICHMOND: We definitely
have evidence

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:13.930
that the stone tools were being
used to break the long bones

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.600
in order to get to the marrow
inside the long bones.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.000
There were clear cut marks
on the bones of turtles,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.700
crocodiles, big antelopes,
little antelopes, even hippos--

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.630
really big animals like hippos.

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:29.300
So we know that meat had
become a new important part

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.660
of the diet of Homo habilis.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:36.860
NARRATOR: The first fossil to
be called Homo habilis included

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:41.930
21 bones of the hand and was
nicknamed Handy Man.

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:44.730
RICHMOND: This little
bone is the bone at
the end of the thumb,

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:48.200
and that little bone in Homo
habilis, like in humans,

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.630
is very broad.

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:54.900
And the broad bone
reflects having a broad
pad on the thumb,

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:59.360
with a lot of surface area
for fine, precision grip.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.230
NARRATOR: With newly
dexterous hands,

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:06.430
this creature could
make better tools.

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:09.960
But what was it like?

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.330
The few skeletal bones
that have been found

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:15.430
indicate a creature
much smaller than us,

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:18.300
about the same size as
Lucy and Selams kind--

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:24.000
Australopithecus--
three to four feet tall.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.930
Homo habilis was still
apelike in many ways,

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:30.260
but with a critical difference.

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:32.400
RICHMOND: What we see in the
evolution of Homo habilis

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.700
is an expansion
in the brain size

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.530
compared to Australopithecus.

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:40.200
So here is the skull
of Australopithecus,

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.000
and it has no forehead,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.900
it just has the straight
slope behind the orbits.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.930
Whereas here in Homo habilis

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:49.630
you see a sloping,
elevated forehead.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:52.660
And in Australopithecus,
the area behind the orbits

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.500
is pinched in, also reflecting
a small frontal region.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.760
In contrast, in Homo habilis,

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.060
we see an expansion of
that area behind the orbits

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.760
that points to an expansion
in the cognitive capabilities

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.260
of higher functions,

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.930
of the higher reasoning
functions of the brain.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:14.960
NARRATOR: It was an
expansion equivalent to a
doubling of brain volume.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.330
HOLLOWAY: Once you
go from something

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:19.830
like 400 cc in
australopithecines

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:24.100
to, say, 700, 800 cc
in Homo habilis, yes,

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:29.100
you're getting a big increase
in cognitive capacity.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.430
NARRATOR: And along
with his bigger brain,

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:37.460
Homo habilis was starting
to look a lot more human.

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.760
The contours of fossil skulls

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.230
allow reconstructionist
Viktor Deak

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:50.500
to reveal the faces
of early human beings.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:54.230
Gone is the projecting
snout of an ape.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:41:06.100
In Homo habilis, the face
of humanity is emerging.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:11.160
This poses a great enigma.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.760
Why, after millions of
years of flat-lining,

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:24.600
did brain size and mental
capacities suddenly take off?

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:35.730
Two million years ago, what
jump-started human evolution?

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:41.630
Scientists all over
Africa looked for clues.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:44.130
Here in Kenya they found some,

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:48.030
at the southern end of
the Great Rift Valley.

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:51.000
Its a hotbed of
tectonic activity

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.260
where ancient layers are
forced to the surface.

00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:02.430
Ten million years ago, Africa
was a much wetter place,

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:10.030
a tropical jungle which has been
slowly drying out ever since.

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.100
But these rocks in Kenya show

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:15.630
that Africas gradual drying
trend was punctuated

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:19.730
by bursts of wild
climate fluctuation.

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:24.330
Rick Potts is an expert
in reading the rocks.

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:25.730
POTTS: This layer right here

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:29.430
represents about 1,000 years
of environmental stability,

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:32.600
but then we had an abrupt
volcanic eruption,

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.760
and then the lake was
around for perhaps 500 years

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.360
before a drought, then
the lake came back.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:42.630
So in some cases we saw this
through layer after layer

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:47.300
of environmental change.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.860
NARRATOR: With his trained
eye, Rick could see

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:55.100
some layers were once lake
beds, others desert sands.

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.100
Still others came from
volcanic eruptions--

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:04.430
a snapshot of a million
years of climate history.

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:09.030
This observation led him
to an amazing new idea--

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:14.100
rapid change as a catalyst
for our evolution.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.930
POTTS: And I began
to think that, well,

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:20.000
maybe its not the particular
environment of a savanna

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.360
that was important,

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.930
but the tendency of the
environment to change.

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:26.530
NARRATOR: Could it
be that the need

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:28.800
to survive violent
swings of climate

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:35.630
made our ancestors
more adaptable?

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:39.530
A group of scientists has come
here from Germany to find out

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:47.430
just how radical these swings
of climate really were.

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:50.860
Its hard to believe, but
these huge rock formations

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:54.130
are made of the shells of
tiny one-celled organisms

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:59.830
called diatoms.

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:07.130
There are many different kinds,
but they all live in water.

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:10.900
Their shells collect in
layers of rock that pile up

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.060
over millions of years,

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:19.530
proving that this whole
valley was once a giant lake.

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:22.660
Annett Junginger analyzes
these rock samples

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:30.160
under the microscope.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.330
What Ive discovered was

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:35.600
that those white layers consist

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.500
of a special kind of diatoms
which only live in deep lakes.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.430
NARRATOR: But between
the white layers

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:45.700
she also finds other
species of diatoms

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:50.430
which only live
in shallow water.

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:54.230
It means that in this spot,
a massive lake appeared

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:59.860
and disappeared and
reappeared many times.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:01.930
JOHN KINGSTON: These lakes
are really significant;

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:04.100
these are not small ponds.

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.860
And what weve been
able to document now

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:10.700
is a series of lakes
that are cycling.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:15.030
MASLIN: Were talking
freshwater lakes the
size of Lake Victoria,

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:17.760
filling the whole Rift Valley,
and then disappearing.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.630
Enormous amount of water
rushing through this area.

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:23.730
This constant flux of
turnover, of change.

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:25.230
An awful time to live here.

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:27.130
It's not just a
unidirectional change.

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:31.000
It's going back and forth.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.100
NARRATOR: Against the backdrop
of a slow drying trend,

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:37.660
Africa was periodically
pulsing with climate change:

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:41.300
wet, dry, then wet again,

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:44.560
sometimes in the
space of 1,000 years.

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:49.230
Punishing drought alternated
with storms and monsoons.

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:54.000
Rivers and forests sprang up,
then turned to dry grassland

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.200
all in the evolutionary
blink of an eye.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.630
So we have a complete
change of our ideas,

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:03.600
from this slow drying out,
to this incredible change

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:06.730
between wet and
dry, wet and dry.

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:10.200
NARRATOR: What effect did
that have on our ancestors?

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.760
Could these periods of climate
instability be the key

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.130
to understanding the
evolutionary leap

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:19.500
from small bipedal apes

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:25.860
to the larger brained
toolmaker, Homo habilis?

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.130
To know that, scientists
needed a detailed record

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:32.360
that went back further
than the diatoms--

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:36.300
way back to the time when
Homo habilis was evolving

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.360
two million years ago.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:43.300
That's only found in one
place-- under the ocean.

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.500
Layers of deep-sea
sediment tell a story

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:49.300
that goes back
millions of years.

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:55.760
They have to be drilled
from the ocean floor.

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.730
At his laboratory
in Upstate New York,

00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:01.600
Peter deMenocal keeps
thousands of columns

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:09.630
of sand, silt and rock--
a library of ocean cores.

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:13.460
deMENOCAL: One of the
really attractive features
about ocean sediments

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:16.630
is that they accumulate very
slowly but very gradually

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:20.230
and continuously over time.

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:24.260
NARRATOR: Each three-foot long
core holds a continuous record

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:28.430
of dust carried on the wind
from Africa into the ocean,

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:31.030
where it now sits on the bottom.

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:32.660
Oh, nice! Wow! There we go!

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:34.060
Sweet-- okay.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.460
NARRATOR: An expert eye can
detect distinct layers--

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.030
thick in dry years

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:42.300
when the dust is easily
picked up by the wind;

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:45.200
thin in wet years.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.860
By measuring the layers,

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:51.430
they can tell when the
climate was wet or dry.

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:54.200
deMENOCAL: So we can read
these deep-sea sediments

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.860
almost like an earth history
book of past changes in climate.

00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:00.200
NARRATOR: To make sense of all
this dirt, they have to know

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.460
when it blew into the ocean.

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:07.460
They can do this by dating the
shells of tiny sea creatures

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:11.560
that sank to the bottom
at the same time.

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.100
deMENOCAL: So this
gives us an age,

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.960
the other analysis
gives us the climate.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.700
Oh, nice!

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:20.330
NARRATOR: Peter took this
finely detailed climate diary

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:25.800
and compared it to the grand
arc of our human evolution.

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.200
For the three million years
between Toumai and Selam,

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:34.460
when brain size was
flat-lining, African
climate was stable--

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:38.800
dry... getting a little drier.

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:43.200
Then came 200,000 years of
wildly varying climate,

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:48.930
careening unpredictably
between wet and dry.

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:52.030
During that time,
stone tools appeared

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:55.930
along with the larger brained
creatures that made them.

00:48:55.930 --> 00:49:00.360
Africa was also home to many
other humanlike species.

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.660
Climate instability put
pressure on all of them.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:05.360
So there are these time periods

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.430
when African climate
was really unstable,

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:09.330
so anything that was
living there at the time

00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:10.730
would have had to adapt

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:13.200
to really dramatically
different climate changes.

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:18.230
NARRATOR: Those that
couldnt adapt died out,
like Selam and Lucys kind.

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:27.930
Better problem-solvers, like
Homo habilis, survived.

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:29.500
The new discoveries

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.330
about ancient climate
upheavals in Africa

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:35.830
have led Rick Potts to
formulate a bold theory

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:39.600
of human evolution.

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:43.060
POTTS: The traditional idea we
have had about human evolution

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:46.260
is that it was the
savanna-- the grassy plain

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:49.460
with some trees on it--
that was the driving force.

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.760
But instead, what
weve discovered

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.600
is that climate
changed all the time.

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:58.560
And so the idea that
weve come up with is

00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.900
that variability itself

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.100
was the driving force
of human evolution

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:09.030
and that our ancestors were
adapted to change itself.

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:12.430
NARRATOR: Its a simple
but revolutionary idea--

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:17.360
human evolution is natures
experiment with versatility.

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:21.300
Were not adapted to any one
environment or climate,

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:22.530
but to many.

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:26.530
We are creatures
of climate change.

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:29.430
I think we should actually
look to our proud ancestry

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:31.430
and how we evolved in
East Africa and say,

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:33.400
That's how we survived that.

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.660
We can survive the future.

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:41.000
Because we are that creature,
because we are that smart.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.830
NARRATOR: Today, climate change
seems to threaten our survival.

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:50.700
But it may have held the
keys to the astonishing story

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:54.500
of how we became who we are.

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:58.800
Because it didn't stop
two million years ago.

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.260
These dramatic
upheavals would continue

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:05.700
for another million
and a half years,

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:10.230
propelling our ancestors down
a road leading ultimately

00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:23.860
to the smartest creature
the world has ever known.

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:26.230
