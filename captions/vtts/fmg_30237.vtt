00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.830
From London-- join students

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.430
from the London Business School
for C.E.O. EXCHANGE.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.900
It's a city of contrasts.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.960
Tradition abounds...

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.130
yet net fever
has taken London by the reins.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.860
Meet two C.E.O.s helping turn
the Old World new.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.730
Those words weren't even in
our vocabulary eight months ago.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.730
Jim Rose of the on-line
auction site QXL.com

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.800
and Kevin Roberts
of advertising giant

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.360
Saatchi  and  Saatchi are high-tech
with a British accent.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.830
Once we can connect
emotionally on the net

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.030
it will become
a more powerful medium.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.000
Next, two C.E.O.s driving
forces in Europe and beyond.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.230
Exclusive national funding
is provideby A.T. KEARNEY]

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.060
They're called innovators;

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.400
big thinkers;

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.730
the leaders;

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.230
the ones who push
when others pull.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.530
Some transform industry,
other change society.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.400
Many inspire a new generation.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.400
C.E.O.s,
Chief Executive Officers

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.260
facing challenges,
achieving success

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.030
telling their stories.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.560
And now our host

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.900
CNN's senior analyst,
Jeff Greenfield.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:46.160
( applause )

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.100
Thank you
and welcome to C.E.O. Exchange.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.860
It is a blow to my American
arrogance to admit this

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.230
but coming to Europe
sometimes makes me feel

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.800
like I have landed in
an advanced civilization.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.900
You have high-speed trains,
the Chunnel

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.730
digital television in the home

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.330
the best wireless phone networks
on earth.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.460
But when it comes to the web,
it is different.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.860
The earthquake that has shaken
the American business landscape

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.400
to its roots is still
more or less a tremor here.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.730
Jim Rose is one of the people
who wants to change all that.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.460
Since 1999,
he has been C.E.O. of QXL.com

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.530
the on-line auction company
that is now one of the top three

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.960
internet retailing sites
in the U.K.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.160
His company is a striking
example of the challenge

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.200
posed by Europe and its culture

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.700
to the so-called
"instant global medium."

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.630
We will meet Jim Rose of QXL.com
later in the show.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.630
But first, Kevin Roberts
of Saatchi  and  Saatchi.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.130
Internet companies
proclaim themselves

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.760
heralds of the new media

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.360
but they are pouring money
into the old media to do it.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.700
That's one reason
why ad agencies

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.100
are enjoying boom times.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.660
More than a C.E.O.,
Roberts is an evangelist.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.430
He literally travels the world

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.560
preaching the gospel
of brand loyalty

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.760
and the perils and promise
of the future.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.330
How you doing, guys?

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.260
Announcer:
Behind Kevin Roberts
are 7,000 employees

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.160
in 150 Saatchi  and  Saatchi offices

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.100
in 92 countries
around the world.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.200
An "A" list
of international clients

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.700
includes Procter  and  Gamble,
Toyota, Sony and Hewlett-Packard

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.330
with international billings

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.600
of over seven billion dollars
in 1999.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.130
Ahead of Mr. Roberts
is the high-profile merger

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.000
with Publicist, the biggest
French advertising agency

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.230
which recently bought
Saatchi  and  Saatchi

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.230
for two billion dollars.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.360
They did some fantastic
media ideas, right?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.600
Roberts:
There's going to be
a new revolution.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.500
We've gone through
the Information Age

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.200
we're past
the Age of Knowledge.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.800
That's not enough
for today's consumers.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.530
They are very cynical,
they are very savvy

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.260
they are very experienced.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.860
Now you have to establish
trust and lust.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.860
Smooth those
out more... okay.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.130
Announcer:
Before Roberts came on board
as C.E.O. in 1997

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.930
big name brands were deserting
Saatchi  and  Saatchi--

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.630
revenues were falling.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.530
In came Roberts who had never
worked in advertising before.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.260
Roberts:
The first thing I did was
to really reinforce the values

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.630
that were already there: that
"nothing is impossible" credo;

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.660
the belief that
Saatchi  and  Saatchi wanted to be

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.900
revered as a hothouse for
world-changing creative ideas.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.630
I didn't bring in
any new people at all.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.800
I did it with the team
that was there.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.830
And that shows, you know,
what strong people we had.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.730
Announcer:
Since Roberts took over
as C.E.O.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.460
Saatchi  and  Saatchi has built
on results

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.630
rather than on commission

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.700
and revenues are up ten percent.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.660
Man:
There has been a steady increase

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.630
in the net new billings
over the years

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.100
to a record $735 million
in 1999.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.260
It was an absolutely stunning
performance.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.430
They are winning new clients.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.600
Announcer:
But those clients can be fickle.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.430
In spite of record
new client gains last year

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.100
Saatchi  and  Saatchi lost
the most international business

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.530
of all advertising agencies,
$326 million.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.230
Constant focus on key clients
is what drives Roberts.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.700
Roberts:
I don't waste any time
worrying about losing them.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.460
I spend my time worrying about

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.230
how to grow
their business faster.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.960
Announcer:
Which explains a lot
about his passion for China

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.830
currently the eighth largest
advertising market in the world.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.530
Roberts:
Saatchi  and  Saatchi is the biggest
agency in China.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.030
We've been there through
rough and rougher.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.300
And we'll be there for rough,
rough and even more rough

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.830
because the opportunity,
the potential is fantastic.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.630
Announcer:
Opportunity knocked for Roberts
when the high school grad

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.960
met '60s fashion legend
Mary Quant in a bar.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.530
The next day he was running
her cosmetics division.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.860
Roberts:
You got dragged in for this
as well, did you?

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.330
Announcer:
As C.E.O.,
Roberts has headed up Pepsi

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.960
in the Middle East and Canada

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.960
where Pepsi outstripped sales
of Coke under his leadership.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.900
In 1989, he moved his family
to New Zealand

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.930
the place he calls home,
when he became C.E.O.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.060
of the Lyon Nathan Brewery
and quadrupled their profits.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.030
We bring more emotion
and more warmth into stuff

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.430
which is where this is going.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.230
Announcer:
Taking on a New Zealand accent

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.700
along with the directorship
of a rugby club

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.530
he has co-written a book

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.760
equating the strengths
of good management and sports.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.360
Ever ahead
of building new business

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.730
Kevin Roberts's other passions
are his family

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.560
playing tennis, watching rugby
and collecting art--

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.100
a lot of art.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.530
A lifestyle far removed

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.100
from his working-class
background growing up in England

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.030
and better suited
to the goal he achieved

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.300
of becoming a millionaire
by the time he was 30

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.130
a goal as bold and inspired
as the art he collects.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.060
Greenfield:
As we say in the States,
"let's get ready to rumble."

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.200
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.060
the C.E.O. of Saatchi  and  Saatchi,
Kevin Roberts.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.100
( applause )

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:49.800
Have a seat.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.060
Fo
( smattering of applause )

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.500
Okay.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.400
It's odd that we're
putting this
on the table

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.130
since we are in
front of an audience

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.560
of business school folks

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.100
but college was
something you skipped
entirely, right?

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.100
Yeah-- I would never recommend
it in today's age

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.400
I think it was...

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.730
In the 60's, it was all about
growth and luck

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.460
and opportunity and a lot of...

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.800
a creative explosion,
right?

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.230
Greenfield:
I'm still
wrestling

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.360
with this story and
the greater moral of it.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.260
Let me see if I can
at least find one.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.300
When you now are
the C.E.O. of a company

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.430
that I assume employs
a great many people

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.160
with high university
education

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.760
and graduate
degrees and all

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.760
what, if any, role
does this educational
background

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.060
or lack of it have
in how you lead now?

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.600
When we hire people

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.330
at Saatchi  and  Saatchi we are just
looking for a couple of things:

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.560
One, are they team players?

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.130
You know,
do they work in a team?

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.500
Because we don't like these

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.330
kind of...
disruptive influences.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.100
We like people who are
disruptive within a team.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.200
So, it's kind of
one team, one dream.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.560
We look for people
who are competitive

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.200
passionate and restless

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.400
people who are driven
by emotion

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.460
rather than by logic
and rational stuff.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.330
We just hired
some account executives

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.130
and we put this ad in the paper
with no logo on it.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.860
We just put,
"Would you like to join

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.430
the hottest idea shop
on the planet?"

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.860
So we got a lot
of people who were
crazy enough to apply.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.430
And then we said, "Okay,
we're at Saatchi  and  Saatchi.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.330
Come in for an interview
tomorrow."

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.300
So a lot of people
came in, kids.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.860
We didn't ask them where
they'd been to school
or what they did.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.500
We just gave them all
a Polaroid camera
and said

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.660
"Come back tomorrow
with three pictures

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.430
that are going
to change the world."

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.160
And this New Zealand kid, 22

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.700
came back in with three pictures
of himself.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.160
Greenfield:
Did you hire him?

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.400
We hired him and we've
promoted him twice
in two years.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.300
Not because he comes from
New Zealand, entirely.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.900
To me, to me, though,
this is

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.730
a striking illustration
of what, I gather, is

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.700
at the core of your...
professional life.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.100
That is...
Lunacy.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.630
No, I wouldn't
put it that way

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.230
although, I'll take
your guidance.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.730
I was thinking more
of the instinct,
the emotion

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.260
as you say,
the non-rational.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.560
And my question
to you is,
as a C.E.O.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.930
of a worldwide company,
are there times

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.200
when you have to
do it the other way?

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.100
When you have
to be methodical?

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.860
If you are looking
at budgets

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.900
if you are looking
at decisions that
involve money

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.860
or can you always
be this person

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.660
who is thinking in
this intuitive, hunch way?

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.900
When I joined the company
the first thing I did

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.030
was get rid of
the human resource department

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.960
and the second thing I did was
get rid of the budget process.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.660
So we don't do
that stuff anymore.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:33.630
( laughter )

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.900
So when I go
to an agency

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.300
I just look at the work.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.630
If the work is great
we are going to make money.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.660
You know,
this is a real simple business--

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.360
do great work,
look for imagination

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.030
look for intuition,
look for ideas.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.900
They are all
kind of "I" words, right?

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.160
Then look for "E" words like
emotion, excitement
and energy.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.030
And if all that stuff
is happening

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.460
you are going to make
bucket loads of dough.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.730
Couple more things before
we bring out our next guest

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.160
and then you're going
to come back

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.900
and we're going
to really rock and roll.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.260
There's just
a couple of things.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.960
Part of what you
are blunt about
is yourself.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.230
Blunt, blunt.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.760
When you worked in
New Zealand with
a brewery

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.000
Lyon Nathan, which had
some hard times

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.460
you were quoted as saying
about yourself--

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.730
this is you
speaking--

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.160
"I was crap for my
last three years.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.930
I was entrenched,
conservative and
risk-averse."

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.230
How, given your personality,
could that have happened?

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.960
And what lessons should
these young folks

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.830
take from the fact that,
by your own measure

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.130
you found yourself
in a position where
you weren't you.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.100
First of all, never let
a C.E.O. stay around

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.360
for more than seven years--
shoot him.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.960
Because, you know,
year one you spend

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.660
kind of getting really
excited about it

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.400
learning who people are.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.460
Year two, you learn a bit
about the business.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.300
Year three, you start
having some ideas.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.900
Year four, you start
executing them.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.160
Year five, they start
coming to fruition.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.900
Year six, you start believing
your own bullshit.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.760
And year seven, you start
defending it, right?

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.100
So, if a C.E.O. has
been there for...

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.700
how long has the guy
who's going to be on
next been here?

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.260
Well, shorter than you.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.100
Okay, that's good then.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.200
Anyway, once they're there
seven years, show them
the door, man.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.130
Give them lots of money,
whatever, show them the door.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.860
Rule number one;
rule number two--

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.760
never work
in a declining industry.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.330
Man, it is just too hard,
it is too hard.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.700
I'm a growth guy,
I'm all about people

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.430
I'm all about taking risks.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.660
And that gets tougher
and tougher and tougher

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.900
if you are in an industry
which really needs

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.900
process decentralization--
re-engineering, restructuring

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.630
and all
this gobbledygook, right?

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.860
I don't like
closing down stuff, you know?

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.530
So I was really no good at it.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.800
And I stayed there...

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.800
resisting that because
I didn't want to fail.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.900
And yet I was failing
more and more every day.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.960
One more thing
in this area.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.860
I know you dropped
the word "advertising"

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.000
from Saatchi  and  Saatchi,
but you do advertise.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.630
You sell... anything
you wouldn't sell?

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.160
I mean, there are companies
that won't take cigarette ads.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
There are companies
that won't do politicians.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.960
There are companies that won't
do genetically modified food.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.030
Anything you
won't take?

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.960
If it's legal, we'll do it.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.560
No problems
about this?

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.960
Zero-- you know, I don't have
a direct line to the Almighty

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.700
nor do I have a direct line
to government policy.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.360
So if it's legal, we'll do it

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.660
and if it's profitable,
we'll do it a lot.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.900
( laughter )

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.330
Kevin will be back
with us later

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.430
and will try to draw
him out of his shell.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.460
But for now,
let me thank you.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.330
Ladies and gentlemen, say
good-bye to Kevin Roberts.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:28.100
( applause )

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.430
I don't know how many
stereotypes were smashed

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.230
in those last few minutes,
but I suspect a fair number.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.860
Um, for a British C.E.O.,
our next guest is unusual

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.900
and that is because
he is an American.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.930
Jim Rose joined QXL.com in 1999.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.760
He turned down an opportunity

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.230
to head a Silicon Valley-based
start-up in the process.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.960
QXL.com is the Euro-challenger
to Priceline, eBay, Yahoo

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.130
and his biggest weapon
in this fight is the fact

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:56.100
that even on-line, people seem
to like to shop closer to home.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.100
By the end of 2001,
there will be more people

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.930
on-line in Europe
than in the United States.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.100
And Jim Rose has a plan
to capture those eyeballs

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.360
along with their pocketbooks.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.930
So, how you doing?

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.230
Announcer:
If it's Tuesday,
Jim Rose must be in Britain

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.730
or Germany or Poland

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.730
or any of the other
13 European countries

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.400
where QXL.com is on-line

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.900
the first multi-language
auction site.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.760
Allo, QXL....

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.900
Wir haben schon in dem Sinne
das eben mit meines...

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.830
Announcer:
Operating in nine languages,
dealing in 13 currencies

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.560
figuring out 13 local taxes

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.100
QXL can also switch languages
and services

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.930
to facilitate
cross-border bidding.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.530
Si, si, si...

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.930
Announcer:
QXL is a uniquely
pan-European business

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.200
with an all-American C.E.O.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.530
Rose:
There are so many things

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.000
happening and to be done.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.100
Being a part of that,
being in the middle of that

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.730
as a major e-commerce player
in Europe

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:49.530
is an exciting place to be.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.630
is an exciting place to be.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.860
Those are the things
that keep me here

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.700
the cultural side
and the business opportunities.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.000
Announcer:
Jim Rose was born
and raised in Illinois.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.530
His father
still practices law there.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.400
His mother is a housewife.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.660
In high school, he ran
his local Kentucky Fried Chicken
outlet part-time.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.730
When he graduated
some months early

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.900
he managed that K.F.C. full-time
and oversaw ten others.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.860
...whether it's the
entrepreneurial spirit...

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.030
Announcer:
Jim's ambition
continued on into college

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.900
where he eventually
earned his M.B.A.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.330
from Northwestern University's
night program.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.100
In 1993, Jim was named
U.K. managing director

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.500
of A.C. Neilsen,
and moved to London.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.700
Rose:
You could be a small fish
in a big pond, if you will

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.060
in the U.S.
at that point in time

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.660
or be a big fish
in a small pond here

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.330
and really extract
those opportunities.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.760
And that's clearly what I saw
in the European marketplace

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.960
and that's why I came here.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.160
Announcer:
In 1996, Jim was recruited

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.960
to be C.E.O. of Blackwell
Information Services

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.960
and launched one of the first
on-line book shops.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.760
Two years later he became C.E.O.
of United Information Group

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.060
a division of Britain's
communication power house--

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.430
United News and Media.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.400
Last year he took on
stewardship of QXL

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.160
when it was
in just four countries.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.200
The on-line auction site is now
in eleven European nations

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.700
and moving east.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.730
Asia could be the next stop
for QXL

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.600
And they're also getting
into personal finance

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.560
and other areas
besides auctions.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.760
They just started a credit card

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.760
which is really going to be
the cornerstone

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.330
for their move
into personal finance.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.430
Announcer:
When he is forced to relax

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.060
Jim goes deep-sea fishing
and plays some golf.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.630
But like QXL,
Jim Rose is always working.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.830
He takes meetings
in the hallway...

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.930
He's got another
meeting at 4:30.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.730
Announcer:
gives interviews on the run...

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.460
Not just QXL--
no, just in general.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:32.030
Announcer:
and insures that QXL is
aggressive in so many alliances.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.000
It has co-market auction deals
with AOL and Excite

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
and with Blockbuster in the U.K.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.030
It has a stake
in a television company

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.800
developing interactive auctions.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.930
With 70% of its users
repeat customers

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:48.060
it's estimated that QXL
will be in profit by 2003

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.200
a year earlier than forecast.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.800
But the Yanks are coming.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.500
E-bay, Amazon and Yahoo have

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.660
already a strong presence
overseas.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.600
E-bay may have larger revenues

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.760
but QXL is heavier in registered
users with over 1.7 million.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.730
Rose is open to growth
in other ways.

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.060
D'accord, je vous remercie.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.160
Alors, au revoir.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.900
Announcer:
It's not the competition

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.700
that keeps this self-confessed
workaholic awake at night

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.460
but staying on top
of the technology

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.130
and delivering customer service.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:18.000
Jim Rose acknowledges
that he's a fast decision maker

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.800
admitting that he'd be
a terrible government worker

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.630
or gardener.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:26.600
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome the C.E.O. of QXL.com

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.260
Jim Rose.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.260
Welcome.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:40.760
Have a seat.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.460
So, when you were
in high school

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.360
you were running
a number, I gather

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.360
of Kentucky Fried
Chicken franchises?

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.000
Exactly, exactly.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.530
So at the risk
of over generalizing

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:50.800
is it a really useful thing

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.860
for people who want to make
a career in business

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.130
to really move

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.860
to get that under
their belts very young

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.330
that experience
of dealing with crisis,
managing people?

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.700
I think so.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.760
I think life gives you
its turns, if you will

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.900
as you go through.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.560
Certain things are put
in front of you

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.760
and how you make your decisions
and where you go.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.260
It happened
to work out well for me

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.700
but I think
learning very early...

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.230
I've always
kind of been very early

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.760
in terms of managing a business.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.230
I was 16, 17 years old, having
to close a store, you know

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.700
responsible for a million-
dollar-a-year store and so on

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.500
and the people issues
that surround that.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.900
I think those experiences,
the more you get earlier

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.800
from bad customer experience
to problems

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.400
to having failures
in that process

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.100
strengthens you
at a very young age.

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.660
And it's all about experience.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.500
I think one of the things you
see with the internet right now

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.230
particularly out of the U.S.
and Europe

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.430
is a lot of bright people

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.060
a lot of energetic
people and so on

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.900
but they lack
the fundamental experience

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.060
about running a business

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.060
and all of its
kind of broad-based issues.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.600
And I think
those early foundations

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.760
have been helpful for me.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.760
Let's talk about

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.360
what I alluded to
at the outset

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.000
which has to be
one of the most
daunting challenges

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.130
of launching or managing
or running a company

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.160
like QXL.com in Europe.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.500
You're dealing with ten
or 11 different languages

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.430
and yet you have this, now...
this system

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.860
which, I gather, has begun
to solve this problem.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.500
Tell us about it, because
I find it absolutely striking

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.830
that you can do this.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.800
Yeah, well, from
a technological
point of view

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.400
I mean, it's not
that rocket science.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.500
We just early got focused

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.060
and were able
to implement it there.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.560
But one of the strengths is

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.300
all of the weaknesses of the
U.S. companies you talked about.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.030
You go through the blue-chip
names in the U.S. markets there.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.160
How many of them are
very suc#ssful in Europe?

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.260
Not many.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.500
And the reason for that is

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.460
the lack of understanding
of these markets

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.830
from a consumer's
point of view

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.200
about language, about
currency, about content

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.700
about how to talk to them
in terms of promotion

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.200
marketing, merchandising--
all of those issues.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.730
So even though there's
the cyberspace out here

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.030
and this ".com"
and this virtual world

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:41.800
at the end of the day,
if I'm French,
I want QXL.fr

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.660
and if I'm Italian,
I want QXL.it.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.730
And the thing about QXL, it's
about giving consumers a choice.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:49.300
So if I'm an Italian,
for example, if I go to QXL.it

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.430
all the navigation's in Italian,
all the currency's in Italian

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.460
and even when I go
into a category to search

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.160
I'll see all
the Italian stuff first.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.360
But if I want to see
the stuff in that category

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.330
in Germany, in France, in Sweden
or wherever the case may be

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.830
I can do that.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.200
As you look ahead

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.860
with Yahoo and E-bay
and Priceline

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.830
clearly looking
at a European market

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.860
is an alliance
or a merger

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.430
something that's
very much in the
possibility for you?

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.700
Well, I think it is.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.830
One issue: we're getting
pretty big, pretty fast

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.360
so that limits the options.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.730
And one of the things I do
as the C.E.O. of the business

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.760
I can't really focus
on things I don't control.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.660
So if someone wants
to do something above me

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.760
then those things happen.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.100
What we've done at QXL is

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.360
we've made eight acquisitions
in about eight months.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.700
We've consolidated the space.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.500
And if you look
at the European landscape

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.560
no other industry segment
is consolidated, at all.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.730
Even the I.S.P.
and the portal market.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.100
The on-line auction market
is pretty much consolidated

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.230
at this point in time.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.030
We've probably spent
about $1.7 billion

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.900
in terms of acquisitions
and currencies

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.230
to get the critical mass
and scale much quicker there.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.360
So my focus is to develop

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.960
the best pan-European
business I can.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.360
If the people up top
want to look

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.030
and consolidate
in strategic alliances

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.230
we'd certainly
entertain that

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.000
but I can't really
focus on that at all.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.660
I think one
of the unfortunate things

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.600
about what's going on
in the new economy is

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.760
the strength of the U.S.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.700
and the U.S. capital markets
are so strong.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.060
It's had five years
to develop and mature, you know?

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.800
If you look
in the European marketplace

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.200
in about eight months,
eight months in all of Europe

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.430
at a population of 380 million
versus 260 million

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:13.700
something like that

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.600
in terms of where
internet penetration is

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.860
and all that kind of stuff

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.930
and they're kind of getting
the European markets

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.530
in eight month's cycle, have
to behave like a mature market.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:24.030
And hopefully the European
markets, if you will

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.630
can have the strength to drive
through, and not be drawn down

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:29.230
by the maturing nature, if you
will, of the U.S. marketplace.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.430
So what's key
to you?

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.900
I almost picture you
as Sir Francis Drake

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.760
and E-bay and Priceline and
Yahoo, the Spanish armada.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.960
Now, that's good for you
since strike one.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.730
But, I mean, as you
see these giants
coming to Europe

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.700
is there one key element
to your strategy

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.700
that says here's how
we're going to make sure

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.760
that we survive this?

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.300
Yeah, well, first of all, all
those players are here, yeah?

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.060
Amazon's been here a year
with auctions.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.530
Yahoo's been here
for over a year.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.660
E-bay's been here
for about two years and so on.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.030
So all those players are here.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.530
And we still continue to grow
at 100% plus per quarter

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:01.860
still continue to lead

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.960
in these marketplace
mediametric statistics.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.300
So we certainly
drive that.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.960
The thing for us,
our differentiation

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.860
our whole point
is the localized service.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.260
You take things as simple
as credit cards in America.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.530
Everybody has a credit card.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:13.800
What's the big deal?

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.430
You go to the Netherlands
and Germany

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.530
credit card penetration--
high teens, low 20s.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.160
What kind of other payment
mechanisms do you employ there?

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.430
You have to do things
differently in those markets

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:23.930
in the way those people transact

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.100
in the way those people
feel comfortable
doing that.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.130
You got to do different
things with your system

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:29.430
to enable that to happen

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.930
and that localization
is the key strength.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.460
A couple of months ago,
as we now talk

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.560
your stock, with the depositor
of receipts in America

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.260
shot through the roof
because...

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.930
by recommendation
from an analyst

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.760
who valued your stock at...
it was like $333 a share.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.130
Some insane amount.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.330
It turned out it was
a 28-year old analyst

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.000
with about a year
experience on the street.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.600
And I would think,
in some ways this could be

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.830
as big a problem
for you

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:57.160
as the other side
when a stock takes
a dip.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.530
You've got a couple of issues.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.930
Managing the capital markets
is a huge task in itself.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.200
QXL is dual listed,
which is quite a unique thing.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.830
We're listed both in London
as well as in NASDAQ in the U.S.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.530
You've got the S.E.C.
in one environment

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.860
and you've got the L.S.C.
in the London Stock Exchange

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.330
and that environment has got
rules and regulations there.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:13.700
You've got investment bankers

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.700
and research analysts
on both sides of the pond

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.230
having different views
of the world.

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.760
So the bulk of my time
unfortunately

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.330
recently has been
in capital markets

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.260
talking to institutions,
investors, etc.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.860
and make sure
the right message gets out.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.060
So it's a very time
consuming process.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.330
Okay.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:29.730
This is a good time now to stop

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.400
and to ask Kevin Roberts
to rejoin us

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.900
for the next part
of this program.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:43.530
Please welcome
back Kevin Roberts.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.260
I want to start
by asking a question

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.100
about corporate cultures.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.400
In a sense, both of you,
in one sense

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.200
were outsiders
when you became C.E.O.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.800
Kevin, you became
C.E.O. of Saatchi

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.730
having never worked
in an ad agency

00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:59.100
so the question is this.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.460
How, as an outsider,
do you come in

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.460
and establish your
authority, your credibility

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.560
and the fact that you are
someone to be respected

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.700
but also not
to be terrorized by.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.960
What did you do your first day
as C.E.O. of Saatchi?

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.130
First day,
I talked about our purpose

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:18.800
which was to transform
the businesses' brands

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.630
and reputations of our clients

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.230
and I talked about our focus

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.260
which was
to just make the best ads

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.760
in the category
in every country we were in.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.760
So the story
that the first day in New York

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.060
you walked through the office
with a baseball bat

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.600
is a vicious distortion?

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.330
Well, I actually didn't go into
New York for a couple of weeks.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.400
I was going around really
where the people were.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.500
One advantage that I had
at Saatchi  and  Saatchi...

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.700
I had two advantages.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.130
One, I never worked
in advertising

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.830
so that's a really good place
to start.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:47.130
So I didn't know what could
be done, couldn't be done

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.000
what should be done,
what shouldn't be done

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.200
any of that nonsense.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.160
When you came into this company

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.530
um... I take it,
most people--

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:56.560
as we established--

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.130
who worked for you
were much younger.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:59.330
Mm-hmm.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.400
You're an American,
they're mostly European.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.560
Did that pose any
particular challenge?

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.030
First of all, this is actually
my third new C.E.O. role

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.760
or managing-directing role, in
Europe, in a European context

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.800
so it wasn't I just
kind of got off the plane

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.260
and said
here I am out of America

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.460
and I'm going to solve
all the world's problems.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.260
I had two previous track records
here in the U.K. marketplace

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.760
dealing with
global businesses
and global enterprises.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.730
I see myself
as another member of the team.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:26.660
I've got a certain set
of responsibilities

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:27.760
as these other people

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.430
and if anyone misses
what we have to do

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:30.760
the organization will miss.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.500
And the first couple of weeks
and months

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.930
is just listen, listen, listen,
listen to these people

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.300
and understand what's going on

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.200
and then you kind of formulate
some views.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.600
Kevin, when I read
your speeches

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.930
that you give literally
all over the world--

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.500
I don't think you've
spoken in Antarctica

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.360
but it's about the only
place you haven't--

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.930
you really do talk
about what you do

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:49.530
so much different
from a job.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.860
I mean, it does sound
to me almost like--

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.430
as I said
at the beginning--

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.860
an evangelist, I mean,
a passionate belief.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.860
Is this what drives you
more than anything else

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.730
more than the material stuff,
more than...

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.100
I mean, your wife and family

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.600
live in New Zealand,
right?

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.600
And you live there,
and New York
and London.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.560
You get to spend how
much time with them?

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.560
A week a month.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.400
What's wrong with that picture?

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.600
It's perfect, right?

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.530
The reason I've been
married 25 years

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.960
is that I'm away
three weeks a month,
you know?

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.160
But, Kevin...

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.700
Roberts:
That's her view.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.860
Is it perfect?

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.660
It seems to me that's
a high price to pay

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.230
for driving this
worldwide company

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.130
that you don't see your kids
three out of every four weeks.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.230
Oh, look, I think balance
is a lot of nonsense.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.960
I think you've got
to avoid moderation.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.100
Nothing succeeds like excess.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.900
Nothing succeeds like excess,
man.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.330
It's about passion.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.530
I'd rather be doing this
than anything in the world.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.230
The chance to talk to you guys
is pretty exciting for me--

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.160
To talk about what I believe in,
it's great.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.600
I don't think it's evangelism;
it's passion, it's love.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.160
I think the only thing you
got to do when you quit school

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.730
is go into something
you really love

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:53.060
because if you really love it

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.060
you're probably going
to be really good at it

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.630
if you're probably
really good at it

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:58.530
you'll probably make
bucket loads of dough.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.330
And this is a great circle
to get into.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:01.500
Your wife will love that.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.430
You'll be able to do
great stuff with her--

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:04.530
your husband, your kids.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:05.800
Passion.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.730
One more question
about corporate culture.

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.760
That's almost
an oxymoron
nowadays, huh?

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.760
Corporate culture?

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.760
Roberts:
Yeah.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.830
Then let me talk about...

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.230
You know what
the right word is?

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:17.230
It's spirit.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.330
Okay,
corporate spirit.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:19.430
That's a better word

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.160
considering the question
I want to ask.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.400
And that is... how, as a leader

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.630
do you deal with the people
who you lead

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:28.000
when things
don't go right?

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.060
For example, you had
a great year last year

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.960
but one of the things
that happened was

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.830
Delta left
Saatchi  and  Saatchi.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:35.600
It's a $100-million
account

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.160
and there were people
at Saatchi

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.430
who bled
for that company.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.160
When you get that
news, as the C.E.O.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.430
what do you do?

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:43.430
Oh, I was there.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:44.430
It was me they fired.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:45.560
All right,
what do you do

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.900
when you go back
to the shop?

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.830
Roberts:
Well we didn't take
a Delta plane

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.700
back out of Atlanta--
I've got to tell you that.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.160
( laughter )

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.760
Greenfield:
Kevin, if you didn't take
a Delta plane back

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.960
you took a freighter
because that's...

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.130
But once you got back

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:02.430
to wherever
you were going...

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:03.830
Auckland or London or...

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:06.300
Look, I don't think
it's about winning at all.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.200
I think it's about
being the best you can be

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.460
and competing in a team
and always improving.

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.960
Don't give people
what they want;

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.260
give them what they never
dreamed possible, right?

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.500
You will fail,
you will lose.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.560
It doesn't matter.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.200
We welcome that,
we think it's great.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.000
Learn from it.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.500
A genius is a guy who makes
the same mistake once, right?

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.700
So we lose Delta.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.700
There's plenty more airlines
out there.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.230
Why did we lose it?

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.500
We lost it
because we didn't
do fantastic work.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.060
So we deserved to lose it.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.130
So we all looked at the work
and we said it's not fantastic.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:35.330
Why isn't it fantastic?

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:37.300
Because they didn't turn us on.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.400
And... for you?

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.700
Was their fault.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.200
Rose:
I'm used to running

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.400
global businesses
with 5,000 people.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.500
To have a pan-European business
with 300 people

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.230
you really can
get your arms around that

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:49.560
and communicate with the people
fairly effectively.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.130
So it's that recent
conversation.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:54.060
We don't have big-account
situations like that going on.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.360
And when things don't go right,
you regroup.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.530
Why did this happen?

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.060
Learn from it
and kind of move on.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.430
Especially
internet time

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:02.630
with your decision making,
you got to go on gut.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.430
As long as you get
more right than wrong

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.330
you're kind of on the right path
because time is of the essence.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.860
One of the things
that we are going to do

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.630
is pose a series of questions

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:13.030
from the faculty here.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.300
And the first one
is to both of you.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.000
It comes
from Lynda Gratton

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.430
who is associate professor
of organizational behavior.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.000
Gratton:
I know that in America
you view stock options

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.630
as a real way of creating
high-performing work forces.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:28.360
Here in Europe we think it's
all down to commitment.

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.600
What do you think?

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.960
Roberts:
I think the key thing is

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.260
to build
a sense of community.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.430
And I think there's been
too much about money

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:35.700
about financial benefits

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.660
about pay for performance,
about results

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.830
about Wall Street
quarterly earnings

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.230
about nonsensical reports
written by merchant bankers.

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:45.360
The hard part is how do you
build a sense of community?

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.060
I suspect...
I suspect you have

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.930
fantastic community
in your company.

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:51.260
We do.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.100
I get that feeling
emanating from you.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.200
Yeah, definitely.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.360
( laughter )

00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:00.260
I can feel it, I can feel it.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.630
And are stock options part of
the inducement for your folks?

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.000
Yes, they are kind of a leg
on the stool, if you will.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.300
They are not the only thing.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.400
It is about this
work environment

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.330
whether you want to use the word
"community," "work environment"

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:15.700
but that sense of belonging
and their sense of contribution

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.360
to do what they want to do...
not just financial recognition

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.530
but just, "Hey, great job"

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:20.730
or just being recognized

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:22.300
that they did
something really good.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.830
And, of course, certainly
compensation has a role in that

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.030
but it is one piece--
not the "be all and end all."

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:29.760
All those things collectively
that make the right combination.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.360
I want
to shift gears here

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.230
and talk about... it's one
of the great buzzword phrases

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:37.230
of stuff,
and that is branding.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:40.630
This is a quote
from Kevin Roberts.

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:44.430
"Products and services
are becoming commoditized.

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:47.230
"That leaves brand
as the only basis

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:49.830
for differentiation
and choices."

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:55.030
The suggestion
there is...

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.930
and Toyota is
one of your biggest
clients, right?

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:01.060
Toyota is going
to make a great car

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.360
but so is Nissan,
and so is Honda

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.160
and so is anybody...

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.230
Well, when you say
"product," you know

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.700
this is the gospel
according to Kevin.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.760
If products are
becoming commoditized

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.560
and brand is the only basis
for differentiation of choices

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.160
then what is it you
are selling people?

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.900
I've moved on from that.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.060
I beg your pardon?

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.330
I've moved on
from there.

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:23.260
I wasn't going to tell you this,
but I will now.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.300
So I now believe

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.230
branding is dead.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:28.200
( audience murmurs )

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.200
( laughter )

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.430
Kevin, you realize this speech
is about two weeks old.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:33.860
Yeah.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.030
Internet speed, baby.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:36.130
I guess so.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:37.260
( laughter )

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:41.900
( applause )

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.160
Where I think we are moving from
is we started with products

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.800
and products are about
functional things, right?

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.530
They... what does a product do?

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:51.330
It gives you
a functional benefit.

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:53.200
It does something for you--
a car.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.660
We then move to trademarks.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.960
What's a trademark?

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.300
It protects that product
for you, the consumer

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.160
gives you a guarantee
of what it is

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.300
and it protects it
for the manufacturer.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.160
Then Procter  and  Gamble
invented brands.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.530
And what do brands do?

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:08.430
They give you fantastic
information, masses of it.

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:10.500
They tell you
why you should buy it

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.530
what the strategic
benefit is...

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.530
I don't think brands
are going to cut it

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:15.700
in the next decade

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.530
because I think you guys
are too smart.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.830
I think what you
are now looking for...

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:22.260
I think you're moving
from trust to lust.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.500
You're moving
from brands to love marks.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.330
And what you want now
are relationships.

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:30.600
You want a relationship

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.430
and I'm sure that's
what you're looking for

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:33.730
with regular consumers, right?

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:36.430
And once you have
a relationship

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.530
that transcends information,
brands die.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.460
I'll give you an example

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.030
which is, um,
two examples

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:45.000
that spring to mind,
in my mind.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.260
My daughter Rebecca,
for her 18th birthday

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.160
we bought her
a red Volkswagen Bug.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.760
You know, the little Beetle?

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.330
Currently that
stays in the garage

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:56.260
because there's no room
in her bedroom.

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.460
If she could...

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.760
( laughter )

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.960
This is a family friend
that sleeps in the garage

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.400
because Rebecca's got
no room in the bedroom.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.800
She is in love
with that car.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.930
It's a lovable thing.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:07.300
People pat it, touch it

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.230
take photographs
of it, okay?

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:10.630
The Apple iMac...

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:14.500
this is the most sensual
product since the vibrator.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.600
You put an iMac
on your desk

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.130
and people stroke it,
they touch it.

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:19.960
There was this great ad
which we didn't do

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.330
and I wish
we had done it.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:22.700
It just had five iMacs--

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.730
you know, the orange,
red, yellow...

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:26.530
and underneath
it said one word:

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:27.960
"Yum."

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.330
So I think
we're moving

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:32.530
from brands
to love marks.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.360
Greenfield:
You know what
we are going to do?

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.360
We are
going to put this

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.960
to a little test here.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:37.960
And I'll show you

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.330
how we're
going to do it.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.200
Now, I know you
have an ad agency

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.130
and that's fine.

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:44.830
But bear
with me a bit.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.000
Roberts:
Who are they?

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.330
Leo Burnett, actually.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:49.800
They used
to be fantastic.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.230
( laughter )

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.200
Greenfield:
Let's say you
were coming to meet

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.700
a very important C.E.O.
of a significant agency

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.760
about this whole
question of branding.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.730
I want you
to tell Kevin

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.200
what you want
from his agency

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.930
and then I want Kevin
to tell you

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:07.230
how he might
deliver it.

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:08.730
Just have
the conversation.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:10.330
I'm butting out
for a minute.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:11.500
Mr. Rose?

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.660
Here's the pitch.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.860
But you tell him what
you are looking for.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:16.560
This is very much
appreciated.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.260
( laughter )

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:22.560
Normally you can never
get to meet these guys.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.800
Just remember, the commissions
can work many ways.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.800
What are you looking
for in a brand name?

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.830
No, it's
just as simple

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.260
as what I
talked about here.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.560
I want to develop
a European, blue chip
Internet brand

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.830
that has values
about customer values

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:37.030
employees,
kind of trust, reliability

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:39.700
and also value-driven from
a customer's point of view.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.660
They can get value and trust
from that.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.700
I want a brand
that's going to stand
the test of time

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.660
that's going to
have the values,
the brand values

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:46.930
we want associated with it.

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:48.460
We're talking about trust

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.060
customer value
and proposition there

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:53.060
and it's going
to really stand
the test of time.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.100
As simple as that.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.860
You're on.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.900
Well, I think what
we would do with that

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.260
is go back, actually

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.660
to something that Bill Bernbach
said way back

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:04.960
which is you got
to interrogate the product

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.300
to interrogate the brand.

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.760
And we would have
to learn a hell of a lot more

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.200
about what you do and
what differentiates you.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.030
Then we would
take you a little bit...

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:15.160
because that was
a very left-brain brief

00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.030
and it was a brief
that's designed to give you

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:21.500
competitive position at
the cortex level of the brain.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.300
It is not going to get

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.700
into the deeply
reptilian part

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:29.060
that will make
a consumer want to have

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.900
a lifetime
love affair with you.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.230
So, what we would try
to do with Jim

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.630
is to break down
the marketing speak

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:38.330
and the business speak

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:41.330
and get much more
into the deep emotions

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:42.900
that I know he has--

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.860
I know you have it
for your brand.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.200
And I know his people--

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.660
these 300 people,
or disciples-- will have

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.730
unbelievable
emotional connections

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:52.430
to your company, I suspect

00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:53.500
that are very deep.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.660
But they are not used

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.430
to spewing them out
on the table

00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:58.160
because they
are used to talking

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.200
like him, you know

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.200
in this capital market
kind of talk

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.030
that the capital markets reward.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:05.060
But that's not
what he wants for us.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.360
He wants us to build
an emotional lifeline

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.230
between your heart
and his brand.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:12.030
And so we would
probe that.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.700
Well, Jim, it sounds
like he wants

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:18.260
to just peel that
cerebral part of you out...

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.500
He wants to give me
a love mark, I think.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.100
That's exactly right!

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.430
( applause )

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:25.900
And I think
you've actually got

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.000
the potential
to be one.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Exactly.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.660
No, he's absolutely spot on

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.100
and the challenge
with our brand

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.400
is we actually
have two customers--
sellers and buyers.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.500
And you got
to talk to them
in different ways.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.960
And that's one
of the challenges.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.930
All the agencies
we've kind of gone through

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.360
really struggle with trying
to bring that essence out

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.560
for both constituencies
out of the single brand.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.200
Before we leave
the branding issue

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.230
there's a question for you from
another member of the faculty.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:50.600
Mark Ritson is assistant
professor of marketing.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.260
Ritson:
I'd like to ask Jim Rose

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.160
what's been
the most powerful tool

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.360
that he's used in building
the QXL brand?

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.100
Rose:
Originally I would have said
it was on-line distribution.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.730
So 100% of our sales
and marketing spin

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:01.930
was in that area.

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:03.230
And as we moved on

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:05.130
we realized that's
not the most effective.

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:07.130
That's a very expensive
kind of proposition

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.530
and the cost to acquire
a customer is very expensive

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:12.060
and now the real powerful tools
are the off-line stuff.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:13.800
We've moved over 60%
of our businesses

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.060
off-line versus on-line--

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:15.830
print, radio, billboard,
outdoor, very effective.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:17.260
off-line versus on-line--

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.930
And now we are kind
of into a third wave.

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:21.430
And it's very much evolving
as Internet penetration goes on.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:23.360
When you have ten percent
Internet penetrations

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.830
in a country, you've got to be
where those ten percent are.

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:27.700
Television advertising
is not the right thing

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.300
because 90% are not
going to understand

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.760
what the hell
you are talking about.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.430
So now we're kind
of in our third phase.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.460
We're still doing some
of those things behind us.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.760
We're finding very effective
is affiliate programming...

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.560
kind of a networked economics
that go there.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.060
And what I call
affinity marketing--

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.860
having ourselves associated
with big brands.

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.400
We've won the exclusive rights
to auction off Wembley Stadium

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.200
when it comes down
at the end of this year.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.760
You are auctioning off famous
Wembley Stadium brick by brick?

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.330
Well, the whole thing,
from the turf

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:54.130
to all the name plates
of the rock stars

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.230
to the Queen's box to
the Queen's toilet to....

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:59.430
All the bricks, everything is
going to be sold in there.

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:01.400
Roberts:
I think the most
famous thing they did

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.460
was this Wembley thing.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.430
It lifted your profile

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.260
from here to there,
you know

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.860
because I'm a sports...

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.060
so you were aiming at me, right?

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.130
And you hit me
like that

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:11.360
because my...
your awareness

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.900
and then suddenly
I did develop...

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.960
started to develop
an emotional bond with you

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.600
because that was so much part
of my history, my heritage

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:18.730
my tradition, my values

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.430
that I gave you
all those.

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:22.760
Last area that
I want to focus on

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:26.200
is probably one of the most
frequently discussed

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.460
about the impact
of new media on old

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:29.860
and that is the notion

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.900
that what's
coming down the pike

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:36.100
is going to revolutionize
traditional media.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.660
From your experience

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:41.600
are the consumers,
are the customers
who use QXL.com

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.400
different in how
they approach

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.730
products and services

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.930
from a customer
that would have gone

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:48.900
into a store or a shop

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:49.800
30 or 40 years ago?

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.200
I think very much so.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.500
I think the medium, if you will,
the Internet medium

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:54.960
allows so many
different things--

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.700
especially
in an on-line auction world.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.130
You talk about on-line auctions

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:01.000
but it's variable-priced
e-commerce.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.300
And if you look at the history
of the world

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.230
most of the world has been

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.500
in a variable-priced,
trade-and-barter kind of world.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.030
And only in Western society have
you gone to fixed pricing

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:11.930
because it's more efficient
to not negotiate

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:13.830
for a Coca-Cola
or whatever the case may be.

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:15.860
But you still negotiate
for your house and car.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.030
So the Internet has allowed
kind of a mass market--

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.960
a global market,
a country market, whatever--

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.360
to actually maximize price

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.800
and-- remember your old
supply-and-demand curves?--

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.130
to actually get a consumer
surplus out of there

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:27.530
and ride that
price curve down.

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:30.330
My 18-year-old son,
having more or less grown up

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:32.300
with a computer,
the argument goes

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.100
has a completely different
relationship to media

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.900
than I did, growing up staring

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.900
at the ten-inch black-and-white
television set.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.730
He will not
be persuadable

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:41.900
in the way I was

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:43.830
by the skills
that you have

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:45.830
to which you
would say what?

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:49.530
Don't think he's
become more cynical, more savvy

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:51.230
and all these buzzwords
that you read.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:52.400
That's nonsense.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.300
The reverse is true.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.800
The only problem
he's got

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.500
is that he's living
in the attention economy

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.400
and he has so many choices
in front of him now

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.830
because you can choose--
you're bombarded

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:05.960
with magazines,
with radio stations.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.360
Everybody is aiming at
the market of one, right?

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.930
And you're also
absolutely time-stressed

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:13.100
because you do have
so many choices.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.500
People are sleeping
1½ hours less a day

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.900
because they can
go on the net

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.060
whenever they like.

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.200
They can do all this
cool stuff, you know.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.500
I'm sitting in New Zealand

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.360
and I can buy the Queen's toilet
from Wembley.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.660
That's pretty cool.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.430
I was never able
to do that before

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:27.660
at 3:00 in the morning.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.030
( laughter )

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:32.800
And I think that what's
happening now is that people...

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.900
you have to hit people now
with your messages

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.960
straight here and here, okay?

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.200
They're no longer information...

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.100
You know, the best way
is to hit them here

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.000
in the first seven seconds.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.660
You don't have 60 seconds,
you don't have 30 seconds.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.230
You have to hit
them quicker

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:50.930
and then you have
to tell them

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:53.230
to go somewhere else
for the information

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:55.130
whether that's on the web site

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:57.700
whether that's on the package
or whatever.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.930
We turn once again
to the faculty.

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:02.930
It comes
from Julian Birkinshaw

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:04.830
who is an associate professor

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:07.600
of strategic
and international management.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.400
Birkinshaw:
Kevin, in the on-line world

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.830
you are coming up

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:13.200
against entrepreneurial,
new, fierce competitors--

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.630
competitors that you've
never come across before

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.200
in your traditional business.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.960
Can you talk about some of the
innovative, creative things

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.200
that you are doing
to confront that challenge?

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.760
Roberts:
Yeah, we are
becoming them.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.330
That's it. We are them.

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:28.660
We are this animal, you know?

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.330
This is just fun for us,
you know?

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:32.960
It's just fantastic.

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.360
And we've got to become them.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.200
We don't want to buy them
or compete with them;

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.500
we want to be them.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.600
I don't know what else
to say except this:

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.260
In a moment we are going to turn

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:44.060
to some questions from our
audience of future M.B.A.s.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.960
But first some background
on the London Business School.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.300
Since 1965, the London
Business School has been

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.800
in the heart of London,
overlooking Regents Park.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.530
Its facade is a London landmark

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:56.560
with its Corinthian columns
and ten pointed cupolas.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.160
The London Business School
was formed

00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.630
to create
an international gateway

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.930
to the development of
better managers and leaders.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:04.830
This year London Business School
will be graduating

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:07.400
a record number of students--
some 600 M.B.A.s

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.930
80% of whom are from
outside the U.K.

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:13.260
The Financial Times ranks
London Business School

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.800
number one in Europe.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:22.200
( applause )

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.200
It's time now
for our audience
of future M.B.A.s

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.200
to ask questions that
they have for our guests.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.060
Please tell us your
name and your question.

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:29.160
Go ahead.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.660
My name's
Joe Mills.

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.030
You both mentioned that you
started getting passionate

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:36.060
about business at the age of 17.

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.500
How important do you think
starting that early has been

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.960
to your future careers?

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.360
In hindsight,
it's been important.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.560
At the time
it was happening

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.000
you just kind
of did what you did.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.960
But I think I've always
been able to kind of...

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.260
because of the experiences
I had at a young age

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:50.830
in managing
businesses or people

00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:53.800
and to get the flavor and taste
for all that kind of stuff--

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.660
I really enjoyed that
at a young age--

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.500
allowed me to have
a much faster pace

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.260
of kind of developmental
experiences as you went through

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.230
and I had those experiences
at a young age.

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:03.630
Then I went to undergraduate.

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:05.700
Then I got a job
and went to graduate school.

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.630
All those things
in a short period of time

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:09.160
really allowed
my experience level

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.500
to accelerate quite quickly.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:11.630
So I think very helpful.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:13.800
Roberts:
For me it was all just luck

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.800
and happenstance and just being
in a bar at the right time.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.000
So start whenever you're ready,
you know?

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
That should be
a fairly easy test, actually

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.230
to just wander into a bar
and see what's what.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.800
Your name and your question,
please?

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.230
My name is Carmen Sutherland.

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:30.930
My question is, both of you have
at one point mentioned

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.830
your shareholders
and shareholder value

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:34.160
in particular Mr. Rose

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.160
working so closely
with the capital markets.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.830
So we pretty much
have a very...

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:42.100
have focused very much
on a stakeholder view

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.030
taking a broader view
of the business

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:45.900
and looking at more
of a stakeholder

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.430
than just a shareholder.

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:50.260
Would you say that that's
realistic in everyday business

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:53.130
or really do you just think
about your shareholder value

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:54.430
that you're adding?

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:56.460
The stakeholder thing is
the right thing to do.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:58.330
I talked about
capital markets
quite a bit

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:00.800
but I talk about customers
and employees equally.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.500
If you take care of your
customers and your employees

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.330
in that process, especially
in a service-related industry

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:08.500
the shareholders will be
taken care of.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.930
So don't mislead my overemphasis

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:11.900
on shareholders in terms
of capital markets.

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.200
It's an important
piece, but all the
stakeholders

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.330
and constituencies
involved are very,
very important there.

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:19.960
I'm 100% on that,
slightly reordering it.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.730
The most important
thing to me is
my people

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.600
building a great sense
of community.

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.800
If the people are

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.200
totally inspired,
totally committed

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.600
they'll do great work.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.230
Great work leads to permanently
infatuated clients.

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:35.100
Permanently infatuated clients
give you lots of money.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:38.200
Lots of money gives you real,
real happy shareholders.

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:42.630
So I put 75% of my time
against people

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:44.400
25% against clients

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:49.760
and I let the share market
decide what it decides.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.000
Woman:
My name is Jane Cody.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.100
Another question
on the capital markets.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.400
How do you make sure

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.860
that the capital markets
understand and attach

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:59.060
a proper value to the decisions
you make

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:02.400
which affect the long term
rather than the short term?

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.100
Yeah, I mean, you don't--
it's as simple as that.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.100
The capital markets have
a mind of their own.

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:09.260
And I've learned
you can't focus on it that much.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:11.500
I mean, clearly, if you are
doing the right things

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.660
to develop the business model,
you're all right.

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:15.900
Some things I think
are really great
and exciting

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.700
and really kind of
strategic happening

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.100
capital markets are flat.

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.230
Some of the things you
kind of do are, in my mind

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:22.300
just kind of good things

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.700
they respond extremely well.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.100
So if you get too caught up
with the capital markets

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.860
and watch it too close,
you'll go nuts.

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:29.400
Just keep building your business

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.330
and it will take care of itself
over time.

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:33.860
And these are very much
long-term kind of propositions.

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.000
Not about last week
or this week kind of thing

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.260
but long term kind of stuff.

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.430
But it will drive you crazy
trying to anticipate

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:40.900
what the capital markets
will do

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.000
to any kind of business
decision that we take.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.030
I found that in a very short
period of time.

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:48.660
Set targets, meet,
beat, repeat.

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.060
( audience chuckling )

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.800
Woman:
My name is Julie Green.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.630
A question actually mostly
for Kevin

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:58.000
but I'd be interested
in the other opinion as well.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Kevin, you said C.E.O.s should
either get out or be kicked out

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000
after seven years.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.260
You've been with Saatchi

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.000
about...

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:04.730
Three.

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:05.730
about three years.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.160
What's next for you?

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:10.430
I'm going to build
a bunch of businesses
in New Zealand

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:13.000
with my kids--
entrepreneurial businesses.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.300
I've already started up
four or five

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.600
and so I'm working with them now

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.500
and we're going to go
into people-related

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.930
small entrepreneurial
businesses.

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:24.330
You like that?

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:26.100
You've got six years
grace, I guess

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.130
under Kevin's rule.

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:28.130
( laughing )

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:29.530
Hey, I'm in internet space.

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:31.800
That seven years...
my time is up.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.000
I've passed myself,
my date, basically.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.400
The Internet is much shorter
cycle than that, I think.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.960
But it's about reinventing
yourself

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.160
reinventing the company.

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.830
I think what Kevin
is alluding to is

00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:41.830
people get stale.

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:43.030
They don't think creatively

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:44.230
or reinvent themselves.

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:45.800
That's a very important piece
to do.

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.660
So right now and for
the foreseeable future

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:49.300
with the new medium,
with the Internet

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.560
I can see doing what I do today
for quite some time

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.760
or doing similar, related
kinds of things.

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.000
You know, the best thing
I've ever learned

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.430
is by running
small businesses.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.060
I own the biggest bar
in New Zealand

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.660
I own a restaurant
in New Zealand

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.730
and I've got like 70, 80, 90
people working in these places.

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:06.860
And I have more fun doing that,
and I learn more by doing that

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.800
than I do by running
Saatchi  and  Saatchi.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:11.400
So I think that one
of the things everyone should do

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.630
is get into a small
entrepreneurial business

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:14.630
as soon as you can

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:16.130
and stay there.

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:19.000
Don't wait
until you retire.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.300
I'm Morton Jorgenson.

00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:22.460
I'd like to pick up
on Kevin's last remark.

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:23.860
You seem to be implying

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.530
that you are not having fun
at Saatchi  and  Saatchi

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:29.530
or that you are having more fun
doing your own thing.

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:31.930
Uh, how do you ensure
that when you go to work

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:33.760
in a company
like Saatchi  and  Saatchi

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.800
that you have the passion
to make your colleagues

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.830
and employees deliver
their best?

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:43.360
How do you do that?

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.360
By total belief.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.030
I don't have to insure it.

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:47.260
I live it, I am it.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.630
Every day for me is just
rock and roll

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:51.000
at Saatchi  and  Saatchi.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.160
I love it.

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.360
But I spend a week a month
in New Zealand.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.260
I spend a week in New York,
a week in London

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.230
a week traveling around
the rest of the world.

00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.500
Just to follow up

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.600
your hours are
pretty long,
I gather, right?

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.230
What's a normal day
for you?

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:05.100
We should let this
audience know.

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.060
Well, at seven days a week,
my last 48 hours have been...

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:09.060
I was in Chicago.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.400
I flew all night.

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.360
I got home, changed suitcases,
went to Paris.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.430
Was in meetings until 12:30 last
night in Paris.

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:15.730
Up at 5:00 this morning

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:17.300
in to Amsterdam for a lunch

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.500
and to Rotterdam
for afternoon meetings.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.900
In to London to do this

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.330
and I still got stuff
back at the office to do.

00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:24.600
So, it's that
kind of stuff

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.700
that is
in this space.

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:27.460
But it seems, when
you go through that

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:29.060
it seems kind of
like a chore

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:32.030
but I've got to say, you know,
keep talking about this thing.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:34.030
I love what I do--
that is what drives me

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:35.900
and if I could do more of it,
I would.

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.430
It is fun.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:40.300
My schedule the rest of the week
is Stockholm, Frankfurt, Denmark

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.830
a board meeting
tomorrow morning.

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:44.330
So it's that kind of lifestyle
and it's not for everybody

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:45.560
but it's something I enjoy.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.960
But I've got to get on
to whatever he's taking.

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.030
( chuckles )

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:51.200
Greenfield:
I'm exhausted.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.060
Your question.

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:53.060
Your name
and question.

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:54.230
Hi, I'm Christian Barajan.

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:56.430
My question is
for kind of both of you.

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:58.030
You've both come in

00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:01.030
and transformed the businesses
probably from where they were

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:04.160
and led it
into something different

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.700
from what it was
when you actually came in.

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:08.200
And it takes a lot of commitment

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.530
from what you've said, Jim.

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:11.530
You said there's
a lot of commitment

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:14.160
but probably travel
from one place to the other

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.530
and lack of sleep

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:18.200
as you said you've been
with three hours of sleep.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.560
You have that commitment.

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:22.230
But how do you actually
transform that commitment

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:23.660
from you to your employees

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.600
and in other cases, probably
the stakeholders more

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:27.830
of the family you have.

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:29.600
How would you actually get
that going?

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:33.100
Start with setting
the greatest imaginable
challenge

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.130
turning that
into an inspirational dream

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:39.800
sharing the dream,
giving it focus

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.430
and providing a deep sense
of community

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:45.560
and then people will work
at peak performance

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:47.360
every day of their lives.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.730
See, I have
a different view.

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:51.100
Kevin talks about
he doesn't believe
in leadership

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.730
and I think
traditional leadership

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:54.660
of the dictator
at the top of
the pyramid

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:56.000
I think those days
are gone.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.430
But leadership
is really about...

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:58.660
it's infectious
to a degree.

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:00.060
If people see
what I'm doing--

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.630
obviously we set goals and
objectives and all that--

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:03.860
but see what I'm doing

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:05.130
it is infectious

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:06.930
and it permeates
through the organization

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:09.530
that people see you do it
'cause you want to do it.

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:11.100
It has almost a network effect

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.630
if you will, in that process.

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:16.000
So I think leadership is more
by example role model

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.730
but seeing the kind of things
I'm doing

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:19.830
and the commitment I have
actually leads through.

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:22.030
And you create a culture
of a way that, you know

00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:23.900
kind of people, some people
can handle it

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:25.530
and some people can't
in that process

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:26.900
and they move on.

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:29.300
So I see it driven through
that way-- very infectious.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.630
My view is

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:34.200
that organizations are full
of inspirational players

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.730
and that too many organizations
look to the top

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:39.060
for that inspiration

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.260
and they look for
the charismatic

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:42.960
you know, incredible C.E.O.

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.030
Whereas in fact,
I look around here

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:48.130
and there's probably 30
or 40 inspirational players.

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.900
And if I could unlock you
to inspire your peers

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:53.500
inspire your bosses,
inspire your colleagues

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:57.160
inspire you partners, that's
one hell of a lot more effective

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.760
you know,
than just having

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.560
this, you know, charismatic
leader at the top.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.800
I mean, Jack Welch, I think,
built General Electric

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.030
through masses and masses
of inspirational players

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:09.830
at every level
of the company.

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:11.400
Woman:
My name is Jemma Harmon.

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.960
It's a question for Kevin.

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.500
You've talked a lot about and
described, in fact, passion

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:16.660
as a fundamental element

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:18.660
of your business
and indeed your life.

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:21.830
Someone who is passionate
and someone who has often heard

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:23.600
organizations talk
about passion

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.000
in reality it is just
a few bubbles in a frying pan.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.660
I'd like to know first of all
from you

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.100
what do you personally do

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:31.400
to insure passion is kept alive
in your organization

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:34.430
and secondly,
what's your next
big passion?

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:37.830
I think that, I don't do
anything to ensure anything.

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:39.230
Okay?

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:42.330
Ensuring stuff and certainly is
what I fight against

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:43.400
and what I abhor.

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:44.760
I love uncertainty.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.360
I think one of the key roles
of a C.E.O.

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:49.900
is to create havoc
wherever he goes.

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:52.330
( chuckling )

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:54.100
And, you know, we live
in uncertain times

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:55.600
so I don't want to ensure
passion.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.830
Passion is something you feel,
you have.

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:00.460
It's there, it's not there.

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:02.030
I've just been in Paris,
like you--

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:04.660
Paris is obviously the place
to be the last two nights--

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:06.430
and Paris is a very
passionate town.

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:08.860
When I'm in Paris, I feel very
passionate, yeah.

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:10.260
We have lots of problems

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.830
I think we choose great clients
who want great work

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:15.000
we talk about the work
all the time

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.830
and we hire the right kind
of people

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:18.300
who come to us passionate

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:23.860
You know, I don't think
you can teach or
ensure passion.

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.100
Yeah, I mean

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.700
I subscribe
to that exactly, exactly.

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:27.700
You can't teach it.

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:30.000
Man:
Uh, I'm Sanjeet Asgupta.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.800
This is a question for Mr. Rose.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.330
You mentioned you've made
about eight acquisitions

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:35.900
over the last eight months.

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:39.360
Evidence has it that over half
of the mergers tend to fail.

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:41.600
How do you intend to manage
this risk?

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.200
One of the things
I did very early on

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.560
and from my
previous experience

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.300
in bigger kind of
traditional companies

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.700
is to actually over-hire.

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.060
Wayne Gretsky-- one of
the great hockey players--

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:52.660
and one of these people would
say about Wayne Gretsky

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:54.260
is what made him so great...

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.700
and he said he'd always skate to
where the puck was going to be

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:58.330
not where it is.

00:51:58.330 --> 00:51:59.560
And I built
our organization

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.560
on where it was going to be,
not where it was.

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.860
So I hired very kind
of senior...

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:05.500
very... a lot
of management bandwidth

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:06.860
brought into the organization

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:08.660
to want to accommodate
the organic growth

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:10.300
that we see at 100%-plus
per quarter

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.860
but also the M  and  A activities.

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:14.500
I didn't want our organization
to be constrained by people.

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:17.030
The market opportunities
actually to be developed there.

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:18.230
So we've done it that way.

00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:19.600
So we've made them very much

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.860
in the mind of, How do we
integrate these things?

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.760
How do they not become
a problem for us?

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.160
Man:
My name is Sanjeev Kanoria.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.100
I'm an alumni of
the London Business School

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.760
and a bricks-and-clicks
entrepreneur.

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.330
Now my question is to Kevin.

00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:33.430
Kevin, you talked about arousing
lust and putting birthmarks...

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:35.530
sorry, love marks on people.

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:36.700
( laughter )

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:37.900
Sorry.

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:39.660
Putting love marks on people

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:41.400
to create loyalty

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:44.100
and to create
an everlasting brand.

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:45.860
My question is very simple:

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:47.700
How would you create loyalty

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:50.400
on a very fickle-minded
internet community

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.200
where loyalty is regarded
as only a click away?

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.060
By never giving them
what they want

00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:59.800
but giving them what they
never dreamed possible

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.860
every time they click on.

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:04.100
( chuckling )

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.500
Greenfield:
I think we've got
one more question

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:08.860
and it's you, sir.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:10.930
Hi, I'm Asi Famoud,
I'm also an alumni.

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:13.960
I would actually like Jim
to answer that question as well

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.730
first before I pose my question.

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:17.360
In terms of loyalty,
it's actually...

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.460
it's about the service
you provide there for...

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.460
In our business, you're
kind of a click away

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:23.760
but if you look at...
when you get the community

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.230
and the network kind
of economics, people stay.

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:27.660
So we continue to bring services

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:29.060
new functionality, new features

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:31.230
and capabilities
to those people

00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:33.360
so when they stay

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.700
there's really
nowhere else to go

00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:36.130
because they've got
everything they need.

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:38.660
Famoud:
Okay, thank you.

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:41.030
One of the things
you emphasized on

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:43.500
on what gives you the edge
in Europe

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.230
is your localized concentration,
your local focus.

00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:51.900
What is to stop your major
competitors-- E-bay and Amazon--

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:53.930
following the same strategy?

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:56.330
Surely it's just a technology
proposition.

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:58.130
Rose:
It's not that way at all.

00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:00.530
Remember, the thing about
consumer-to-consumer auctions

00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:02.860
is about liquidity, and it's
about the whole liquidity

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:04.700
where buyers want to be
where sellers are

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:06.430
and sellers want to be
where buyers are.

00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:08.660
So once you have that natural
marketplace in there

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:09.930
you can't penetrate it.

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:11.800
And I'll use an example
out of the U.S.

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.860
E-bay has been in the U.S.
for a long time.

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:16.260
They charge very big fees.

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:18.160
Yahoo launches auctions
about two years ago--

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.560
the most trafficked portal
around

00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:20.760
they launch a free service.

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.060
Can't dent E-bay.

00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:24.300
Why? Because of the liquidity
that E-bay has.

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.660
You hear these words
about first-mover advantage

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:28.560
and these buzzwords,
critical mass--

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.030
they're very much
important here.

00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:31.160
Once liquidity is there

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.760
once that marketplace is
established

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.260
it's very tough to take it away.

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.200
You just can't come in
with new technology

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:37.460
or new kind of proposition.

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:38.630
So it's critical.

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:40.100
Greenfield:
As you might put it

00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:41.830
they've come to love

00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:43.300
their portal.

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.560
It's becoming a love mark.

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:46.500
Well, to quote
a fairly famous Englishman

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.030
our revels
now are ended.

00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:49.860
I'd like to thank

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:51.760
our audience from
the London Business School

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:52.860
for being here very much.

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:54.030
Thanks, too, to our guests

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:56.800
Kevin Roberts, C.E.O.
of Saatchi  and  Saatchi

00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.560
Jim Rose, C.E.O. of QXL.com.

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.160
If this meeting of the minds

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.630
has helped contribute to the
world's marketplace of ideas

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:04.960
that is the business
of C.E.O. Exchange.

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.360
I'm Jeff Greenfield.

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.500
Thank you very much
for being here, good-bye.

00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:15.960
( applause )

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:20.900
To learn more about C.E.O.
Exchange, visit PBS on-line

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:28.600
at the internet address
on your screen.

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:31.600
All you can do
is be passionate,
have a great idea

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.730
and then get really lucky.

00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:36.230
Do you know what luck is?

00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:37.930
But do you know what it is?

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:40.400
It's when preparation meets
opportunity.

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.800
And it's not a fad, as clearly
as the Internet's a trend

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:45.300
and all the metrics are telling
you where it's going.

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.730
And then I saw
the business model.

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:48.160
And I can look to the U.S.

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.300
and see that model
and adjust it to the way I saw

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.230
and I just took a chance
on consumer uptake.

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:53.760
You got to have table stakes.

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.230
You got to have a vision,
you got to have focus

00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:57.900
you got to have velocity to go.

00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:00.060
So we could bring brand
and technology

00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:02.060
i.e., at no cost based
on proposition

00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:04.530
they throw in the money
with local expertise

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:07.460
so we control an organization
with no capital.
