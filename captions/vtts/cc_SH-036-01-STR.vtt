00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:41.430


2
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.800
Let fame, that all huntafter in their lives,

3
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.070
Live register'd upon ourbrazen tombs

4
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.430
And then grace us in thedisgrace of death;

5
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.330
When, spite of cormorantdevouring Time,

6
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.700
The endeavor of thispresent breath may buy

7
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.200
That honour which shallbate his scythe's keen edge

8
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.300
And make us heirs of alleternity.

9
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.430
Therefore, braveconquerors,--for so you are,

10
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.070
That war against your ownaffections

11
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.830
And the huge army of theworld's desires,--

12
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.900
Our late edict shallstrongly stand in force:

13
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.430
Navarre shall be thewonder of the world;

14
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.500
Our court shall be alittle Academe,

15
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.570
Still and contemplative inliving art.

16
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.170
You three, Biron, Dumain,and Longaville,

17
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.130
Have sworn for three years'term to live with me

18
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.800
My fellow-scholars, and tokeep those statutes

19
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.100
That are recorded in thisschedule here:

20
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.900
Your oaths are pass'd; andnow subscribe your names,

21
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.970
That his own hand maystrike his honour down

22
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.470
That violates the smallestbranch herein:

23
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.970
If you are arm'd to do assworn to do,

24
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.100
Subscribe to your deepoaths, and keep it too.

25
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.630
I am resolved; 'tis but athree years' fast:

26
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.230
The mind shall banquet,though the body pine:

27
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.170
My loving lord, Dumain ismortified:

28
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.600
The grosser manner ofthese world's delights

29
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.130
He throws upon the grossworld's baser slaves:

30
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.930
To love, to wealth, topomp, I pine and die;

31
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.670
With all these living inphilosophy.

32
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.270
I can but say theirprotestation over;

33
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.030
So much, dear liege, Ihave already sworn,

34
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.370
That is, to live and studyhere three years.

35
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.770
But there are other strictobservances;

36
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.230
As, not to see a woman inthat term,

37
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.500
Which I hope well is notenrolled there;

38
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.430
And one day in a week totouch no food

39
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.230
And but one meal on everyday beside,

40
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.500
The which I hope is notenrolled there;

41
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.500
And then, to sleep butthree hours in the night,

42
00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.930
And not be seen to wink ofall the day--

43
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.900
When I was wont to thinkno harm all night

44
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.770
And make a dark night tooof half the day--

45
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.300
Which I hope well is notenrolled there:

46
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.500
O, these are barren tasks,too hard to keep,

47
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.130
Not to see ladies, study,fast, not sleep!

48
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.800
Your oath is pass'd topass away from these.

49
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.330
Let me say no, my liege,an if you please:

50
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.570
I only swore to study withyour grace

51
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.530
And stay here in your courtfor three years' space.

52
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.670
You swore to that, Biron,and to the rest.

53
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.530
By yea and nay, sir, thenI swore in jest.

54
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.400
What is the end of study?let me know.

55
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.800
Why, that to know, whichelse we should not know.

56
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.170
Things hid and barr'd, youmean, from common sense?

57
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.400
Ay, that is study'sgodlike recompense.

58
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.130
Come on, then; I willswear to study so,

59
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.830
To know the thing I amforbid to know:

60
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.800
As thus,--to study where Iwell may dine,

61
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.070
When I to feast expresslyam forbid;

62
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.670
Or study where to meetsome mistress fine,

63
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.200
When mistresses fromcommon sense are hid;

64
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.530
Or, having sworn too harda keeping oath,

65
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.800
Study to break it and notbreak my troth.

66
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.830
If study's gain be thusand this be so,

67
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.030
Study knows that which yetit doth not know:

68
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.530
Swear me to this, and Iwill ne'er say no.

69
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.300
These be the stops thathinder study quite

70
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.930
And train our intellectsto vain delight.

71
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.400
Why, all delights arevain; but that most vain,

72
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.330
Which with pain purchaseddoth inherit pain:

73
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.230
As, painfully to pore upona book

74
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.230
To seek the light of truth;while truth the while

75
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.900
Doth falsely blind theeyesight of his look:

76
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.930
Light seeking light dothlight of light beguile:

77
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.230
So, ere you find wherelight in darkness lies,

78
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.830
Your light grows dark bylosing of your eyes.

79
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.100
Study me how to please theeye indeed

80
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.030
By fixing it upon a fairereye,

81
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.800
Who dazzling so, that eyeshall be his heed

82
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.430
And give him light that itwas blinded by.

83
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.730
These earthly godfathersof heaven's lights

84
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.430
That give a name to everyfixed star

85
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.130
Have no more profit oftheir shining nights

86
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.470
Than those that walk andwot not what they are.

87
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.400
Too much to know is toknow nought but fame;

88
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.270
And every godfather cangive a name.

89
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.400
How well he's read, toreason against reading!

90
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.630
Proceeded well, to stopall good proceeding!

91
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.930
Well, sit you out: gohome, Biron: adieu.

92
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.570
No, my good lord; I havesworn to stay with you:

93
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.700
And though I have forbarbarism spoke more

94
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.830
Than for that angelknowledge you can say,

95
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.900
Yet confident I'll keepwhat I have swore

96
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.130
And bide the penance ofeach three years' day.

97
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.470
Give me the paper; let meread the same;

98
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.800
And to the strict'stdecrees I'll write my name.

99
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.770
How well this yieldingrescues thee from shame!

100
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.730
'Item, That no woman shallcome within a

101
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.400
mile of my court:' Haththis been proclaimed?

102
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.270
Four days ago.

103
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.030
Let's see the penalty.

104
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.030
'On pain of losing her tongue.'Who devised this penalty?

105
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.500
Marry, that did I.

106
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.530
Sweet lord, and why?

107
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.300
To fright them hence withthat dread penalty.

108
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.670
A dangerous law againstgentility!

109
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:57.100
'Item, If any man be seento talk with a woman

110
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.470
within the term of threeyears, he shall endure such

111
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.470
public shame as the rest of thecourt can possibly devise.'

112
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.800
This article, my liege,yourself must break;

113
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.370
For well you know herecomes in embassy

114
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.470
The French king's daughterwith yourself to speak--

115
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.600
A maid of grace andcomplete majesty--

116
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.000
About surrender up ofAquitaine

117
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.730
To her decrepit, sick andbedrid father:

118
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.770
What say you, lords? Why,this was quite forgot.

119
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.800
So study evermore isovershot:

120
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.170
We must of force dispensewith this decree;

121
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.800
She must lie here on merenecessity.

122
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.400
Necessity will make us allforsworn

123
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.470
Three thousand times withinthis three years' space;

124
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.030
If I break faith, thisword shall speak for me;

125
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.730
I am forsworn on 'merenecessity.'

126
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:51.530
So to the laws at large Iwrite my name:

127
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.970
And he that breaks them inthe least degree

128
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.930
Stands in attainder ofeternal shame:

129
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.230
Suggestions are to otheras to me;

130
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.770
But I believe, although Iseem so loath,

131
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.770
I am the last that willlast keep his oath.

132
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.130
But is there no quickrecreation granted?

133
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:18.470
Ay, that there is. Ourcourt, you know, is haunted

134
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.370
With a refined travellerof Spain;

135
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.430
A man in all the world'snew fashion planted,

136
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.100
That hath a mint ofphrases in his brain;

137
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.270
One whom the music of hisown vain tongue

138
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.430
Doth ravish likeenchanting harmony;

139
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.170
A man of complements, whomright and wrong

140
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.200
Have chose as umpire oftheir mutiny:

141
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:44.870
This child of fancy, thatArmado hight,

142
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.600
For interim to our studiesshall relate

143
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.400
In high-born words theworth of many a knight

144
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.530
From tawny Spain lost inthe world's debate.

145
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.400
How you delight, my lords,I know not, I;

146
00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.200
But, I protest, I love tohear him lie

147
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.900
And I will use him for myminstrelsy.

148
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.730
Boy, what sign is it whena man of great spirit

149
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.070
grows melancholy?

150
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.070
A great sign, sir, that hewill look sad.

151
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.500
Why, sadness is one and theself-same thing, dear imp.

152
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.170
No, no; O Lord, sir, no.

153
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.430
How canst thou partsadness and melancholy,

154
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.700
my tender juvenal?

155
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.070
By a familiar demonstration ofthe working, my tough senior.

156
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.700
Why tough senior? whytough senior?

157
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.800
Why tender juvenal? whytender juvenal?

158
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.000
I spoke it, tender juvenal,as a congruent epitheton

159
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.700
appertaining to thy young days,which we may nominate tender.

160
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.130
And I, tough senior, as anappertinent title to your

161
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.170
old time, which we mayname tough.

162
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.200
Pretty and apt.

163
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.970
How mean you, sir? Ipretty, and my saying apt?

164
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.270
or I apt, and my saying pretty?

165
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.030
Thou pretty, becauselittle.

166
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.600
Little pretty, becauselittle. Wherefore apt?

167
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.500
And therefore apt, becausequick.

168
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.330
Speak you this in mypraise, master?

169
00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.770
In thy condign praise.

170
00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.500
I will praise an eel withthe same praise.

171
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.100
What, that an eel isingenious?

172
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.300
That an eel is quick.

173
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.300
I do say thou art quick inanswers: thou heatest my blood.

174
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.200
I am answered, sir.

175
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.370
I love not to be crossed.

176
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.870
You are a gentleman and agamester, sir.

177
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.100
I confess both: they areboth the varnish of a

178
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.230
complete man.

179
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:34.430
I have promised to study threeyears with the duke.

180
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:39.600
But I hereupon confess Iam in love: and as it is

181
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.270
base for a soldier to love,

182
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:46.170
so am I in lovewith a base wench.

183
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.730
If drawing my swordagainst the humour

184
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.300
of affection would deliverme from the reprobate

185
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.700
thought of it, I wouldtake Desire prisoner,

186
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.200
and ransom him toany French courtier

187
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.000
for a new-devised courtesy.

188
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:10.970
I think scorn to sigh: methinksI should outswear Cupid.

189
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:19.070
Comfort, me, boy: what greatmen have been in love?

190
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.000
Hercules, master.

191
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.400
Most sweet Hercules! Moreauthority, dear boy,

192
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.100
name more; and, sweet my child,let them be men of good

193
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.170
repute and carriage.

194
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.600
Samson, master: he was aman of good carriage,

195
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.300
great carriage, for he carriedthe town-gates on his back

196
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.930
like a porter: and he wasin love.

197
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.870
O well-knit Samson!strong-jointed Samson!

198
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.600
I do excel thee in my rapier

199
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.030
as thou didst me incarrying gates.

200
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:55.030
I am in love too.

201
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.230
Who was Samson'slove, my dear Moth?

202
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.570
A woman, master.

203
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.300
Of what complexion?

204
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.130
Of the sea-water green,sir.

205
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.270
Is that one of the fourcomplexions?

206
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.000
As I have read, sir; andthe best of them too.

207
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.330
I do love that country girlthat I took in the

208
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:21.400
park with the rational hindCostard: she deserves well.

209
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:29.230
My spirit growsheavy in love.

210
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.670
A letter from themagnificent Armado.

211
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.070
How low soever the matter, Ihope in God for high words.

212
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.930
A high hope for a low heaven:God grant us patience!

213
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.370
To hear? or forbearhearing?

214
00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.530
The matter is to me, sir,as concerning Jaquenetta.

215
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.230
The manner of it is, I wastaken with the manner.

216
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.370
In what manner?

217
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.770
In manner and form following,sir; all those three:

218
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.770
I was seen with herin the manor-house,

219
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.930
sitting with her upon the form,

220
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.100
and taken followingher into the park;

221
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.930
which, put together, is inmanner and form following.

222
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.500
Now, sir, for the manner,--

223
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.630
it is the manner of a manto speak to a woman:

224
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.270
for the form,-- in some form.

225
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.700
For the following, sir?

226
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.030
As it shall followin my correction:

227
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.300
and God defend the right!

228
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.700
Will you hear this letterwith attention?

229
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.670
As we would hear anoracle.

230
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.730
Such is the simplicity of manto hearken after the flesh.

231
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.500
'Great deputy, thewelkin's vicegerent and

232
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.100
sole dominator of Navarre,my soul's earth's god,

233
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.230
and body's fosteringpatron.'

234
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:41.530
Not a word of Costard yet.

235
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.500
'So it is,'--

236
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.830
It may be so: but if hesay it is so, he is,

237
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.670
in telling true, but so.

238
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.670
Peace!

239
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.270
Be to me and every manthat dares not fight!

240
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.570
No words!

241
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:55.570
Of other men's secrets, Ibeseech you.

242
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.970
'So it is, besieged withsable-coloured melancholy,

243
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.100
I did commend theblack-oppressing humour

244
00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.230
to the most wholesome physicof thy health-giving air;

245
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:09.770
and, as I am a gentleman,betook myself to walk.

246
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.700
The time when. Aboutthe sixth hour;

247
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.070
when beasts most graze, birdsbest peck, and men sit down

248
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.770
to that nourishmentwhich is called supper:

249
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.170
so much for the time when.Now for the ground which;

250
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:28.900
which, I mean, I walked upon:it is y-cleped thy park.

251
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.170
Then for the place where;where, I mean, I did encounter

252
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.230
that obscene and preposterousevent, that draweth

253
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.530
from my snow-white penthe ebon-coloured ink,

254
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:41.230
which here thou viewest,beholdest, surveyest, or seest;

255
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.270
but to the place where; itstandeth north-north-east

256
00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:48.230
and by east from the westcorner of thy curious-

257
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:52.630
knotted garden: there didI see that low-spirited

258
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.900
swain, that base minnow ofthy mirth,'--

259
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:55.670
Who?

260
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:56.670
Me?

261
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.430
'that unletteredsmall-knowing soul,'--

262
00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.870
Me?

263
00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.030
'that shallow vassal,'--

264
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.530
Still me?

265
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.230
'which, as I remember,hight Costard,'--

266
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.300
O, me!

267
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.730
'sorted and consorted,contrary to thy

'with a child of ourgrandmother Eve,

'Me, an't shall pleaseyou; I am Anthony Dull.

ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'

286
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.630
This is not so well as Ilooked for, but the best

287
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:06.970
that ever I heard.

288
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.430
Ay, the best for theworst. But, sirrah,

289
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.000
what say you to this?

290
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.030
Sir, I confess the wench.

291
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.300
Did you hear theproclamation?

292
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.300
I do confess much of thehearing it but little of

293
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.930
the marking of it.

294
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.230
It was proclaimed ayear's imprisonment,

295
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.400
to be taken with a wench.

296
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.900
I was taken with none, sir:I was taken with a damsel.

297
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.330
Well, it was proclaimed'damsel.'

298
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.700
This was no damsel, neither,sir; she was a virgin.

299
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.500
It is so varied, too; forit was proclaimed 'virgin.'

300
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.530
If it were, I denyher virginity:

301
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:34.330
I was taken with a maid.

302
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.200
This maid will not serveyour turn, sir.

303
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.070
This maid will serve myturn, sir.

304
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.800
Sir, I will pronounceyour sentence:

305
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.100
you shall fast a weekwith bran and water.

306
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.930
I had rather pray a monthwith mutton and porridge.

307
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.730
And Don Armado shall beyour keeper.

308
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.830
My Lord Biron, see himdeliver'd o'er:

309
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:21.030
Sir, the duke's pleasure is,that you keep Costard safe:

310
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.930
and you must suffer himto take no delight

311
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:28.600
nor no penance; but a' mustfast three days a week.

312
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.830
For this damsel, I mustkeep her at the park:

313
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.870
she is allowed for theday-woman. Fare you well.

314
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:39.770
I do betray myself withblushing. Maid!

315
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.170
Man?

316
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.830
I will visit thee at thelodge.

317
00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:50.530
That's hereby.

318
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:51.870
I know where it issituate.

319
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.230
Lord, how wise you are!

320
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:57.300
I will tell thee wonders.

321
00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.900
With that face?

322
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.370
I love thee.

323
00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.230
So I heard you say.

324
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.730
And so, farewell.

325
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.730
Fair weather after you!

326
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.630
Come, Jaquenetta, away!

327
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.470
Villain, thou shaltfast for thy offences

328
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:13.600
ere thou be pardoned.

329
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.730
Well, sir, I hope, when Ido it, I shall do it on a

330
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:15.800
full stomach.

331
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.330
Thou shalt be heavilypunished.

332
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.100
I am more bound to you thanyour fellows, for they

333
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:22.470
are but lightly rewarded.

334
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:26.700
Take away this villain;shut him up.

335
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.230
Come, you transgressingslave; away!

336
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:33.130
Let me not be pent up, sir:I will fast, being loose.

337
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.800
No, sir; that were fast andloose: thou shalt to prison.

338
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.730
Well, if ever I do see themerry days of desolation

339
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.570
that I have seen, someshall see.

340
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:42.900
What shall some see?

341
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.670
Nay, nothing, Master Moth,but what they look upon.

342
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.570
It is not for prisoners to betoo silent in their words;

343
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.200
and therefore I willsay nothing: I thank

344
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.100
God I have as littlepatience as another man;

345
00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.470
and therefore I can be quiet.

346
00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.400
I do affect the veryground, which is base,

347
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.170
where her shoe, which isbaser, guided by her foot,

348
00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:10.070
which is basest, doth tread.I shall be forsworn,

349
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:13.970
which is a great argumentof falsehood, if I love.

350
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:17.330
And how can that be true lovewhich is falsely attempted?

351
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.800
Love is a familiar;Love is a devil:

352
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:25.030
there is no evil angel but Love.Yet was Samson so tempted,

353
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:29.600
and he had anexcellent strength;

354
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.900
yet was Solomon so seduced,and he had a very good wit.

355
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.770
Cupid's butt-shaft is toohard for Hercules' club;

356
00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:44.370
and therefore too much oddsfor a Spaniard's rapier.

357
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.530
Adieu, valour! rust rapier!

358
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:54.770
be still, drum! for yourmanager is in love;

359
00:18:54.770 --> 00:19:05.430
yea, he loveth. Assist me,some extemporal god of rhyme,

360
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:13.970
for I am sure I shall turnsonnet. Devise, wit;

361
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:23.630
write, pen; for I am forwhole volumes in folio.

362
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.630
