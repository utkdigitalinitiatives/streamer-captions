00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:41.430


2
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.800
Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,

3
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.070
Live register'd upon our brazen tombs

4
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.430
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;

5
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.330
When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,

6
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.700
The endeavor of this present breath may buy

7
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.200
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge

8
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.300
And make us heirs of all eternity.

9
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.430
Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,

10
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.070
That war against your own affections

11
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.830
And the huge army of the world's desires,--

12
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.900
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:

13
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.430
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;

14
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.500
Our court shall be a little Academe,

15
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.570
Still and contemplative in living art.

16
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.170
You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,

17
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.130
Have sworn for three years' term to live with me

18
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.800
My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes

19
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.100
That are recorded in this schedule here:

20
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.900
Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,

21
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.970
That his own hand may strike his honour down

22
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.470
That violates the smallest branch herein:

23
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.970
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,

24
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.100
Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.

25
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.630
I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:

26
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.230
The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:

27
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.170
My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:

28
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.600
The grosser manner of these world's delights

29
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.130
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:

30
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.930
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;

31
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.670
With all these living in philosophy.

32
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.270
I can but say their protestation over;

33
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.030
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,

34
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.370
That is, to live and study here three years.

35
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.770
But there are other strict observances;

36
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.230
As, not to see a woman in that term,

37
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.500
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;

38
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.430
And one day in a week to touch no food

39
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.230
And but one meal on every day beside,

40
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.500
The which I hope is not enrolled there;

41
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.500
And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,

42
00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.930
And not be seen to wink of all the day--

43
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.900
When I was wont to think no harm all night

44
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.770
And make a dark night too of half the day--

45
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.300
Which I hope well is not enrolled there:

46
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.500
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,

47
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.130
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!

48
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.800
Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.

49
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.330
Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:

50
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.570
I only swore to study with your grace

51
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.530
And stay here in your court for three years' space.

52
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.670
You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.

53
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.530
By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.

54
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.400
What is the end of study? let me know.

55
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.800
Why, that to know, which else we should not know.

56
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.170
Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?

57
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.400
Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.

58
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.130
Come on, then; I will swear to study so,

59
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.830
To know the thing I am forbid to know:

60
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.800
As thus,--to study where I well may dine,

61
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.070
When I to feast expressly am forbid;

62
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.670
Or study where to meet some mistress fine,

63
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.200
When mistresses from common sense are hid;

64
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.530
Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,

65
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.800
Study to break it and not break my troth.

66
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.830
If study's gain be thus and this be so,

67
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.030
Study knows that which yet it doth not know:

68
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.530
Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.

69
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.300
These be the stops that hinder study quite

70
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.930
And train our intellects to vain delight.

71
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.400
Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,

72
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.330
Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:

73
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.230
As, painfully to pore upon a book

74
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.230
To seek the light of truth; while truth the while

75
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.900
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:

76
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.930
Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:

77
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.230
So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,

78
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.830
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.

79
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.100
Study me how to please the eye indeed

80
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.030
By fixing it upon a fairer eye,

81
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.800
Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed

82
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.430
And give him light that it was blinded by.

83
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.730
These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights

84
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.430
That give a name to every fixed star

85
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.130
Have no more profit of their shining nights

86
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.470
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.

87
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.400
Too much to know is to know nought but fame;

88
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.270
And every godfather can give a name.

89
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.400
How well he's read, to reason against reading!

90
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.630
Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!

91
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.930
Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.

92
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.570
No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:

93
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.700
And though I have for barbarism spoke more

94
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.830
Than for that angel knowledge you can say,

95
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.900
Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore

96
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.130
And bide the penance of each three years' day.

97
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.470
Give me the paper; let me read the same;

98
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.800
And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.

99
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.770
How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!

100
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.730
'Item, That no woman shall come within a

101
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.400
mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?

102
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.270
Four days ago.

103
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.030
Let's see the penalty.

104
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.030
'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?

105
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.500
Marry, that did I.

106
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.530
Sweet lord, and why?

107
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.300
To fright them hence with that dread penalty.

108
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.670
A dangerous law against gentility!

109
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:57.100
'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman

110
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.470
within the term of three years, he shall endure such

111
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.470
public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'

112
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.800
This article, my liege, yourself must break;

113
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.370
For well you know here comes in embassy

114
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.470
The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--

115
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.600
A maid of grace and complete majesty--

116
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.000
About surrender up of Aquitaine

117
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.730
To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:

118
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.770
What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.

119
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.800
So study evermore is overshot:

120
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.170
We must of force dispense with this decree;

121
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.800
She must lie here on mere necessity.

122
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.400
Necessity will make us all forsworn

123
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.470
Three thousand times within this three years' space;

124
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.030
If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;

125
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.730
I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'

126
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:51.530
So to the laws at large I write my name:

127
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.970
And he that breaks them in the least degree

128
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.930
Stands in attainder of eternal shame:

129
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.230
Suggestions are to other as to me;

130
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.770
But I believe, although I seem so loath,

131
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.770
I am the last that will last keep his oath.

132
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.130
But is there no quick recreation granted?

133
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:18.470
Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted

134
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.370
With a refined traveller of Spain;

135
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.430
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,

136
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.100
That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;

137
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.270
One whom the music of his own vain tongue

138
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.430
Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;

139
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.170
A man of complements, whom right and wrong

140
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.200
Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:

141
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:44.870
This child of fancy, that Armado hight,

142
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.600
For interim to our studies shall relate

143
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.400
In high-born words the worth of many a knight

144
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.530
From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.

145
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.400
How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;

146
00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.200
But, I protest, I love to hear him lie

147
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.900
And I will use him for my minstrelsy.

148
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.730
Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit

149
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.070
grows melancholy?

150
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.070
A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.

151
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.500
Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.

152
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.170
No, no; O Lord, sir, no.

153
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.430
How canst thou part sadness and melancholy,

154
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.700
my tender juvenal?

155
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.070
By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.

156
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.700
Why tough senior? why tough senior?

157
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.800
Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?

158
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.000
I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton

159
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.700
appertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate tender.

160
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.130
And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your

161
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.170
old time, which we may name tough.

162
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.200
Pretty and apt.

163
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.970
How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt?

164
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.270
or I apt, and my saying pretty?

165
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.030
Thou pretty, because little.

166
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.600
Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?

167
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.500
And therefore apt, because quick.

168
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.330
Speak you this in my praise, master?

169
00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.770
In thy condign praise.

170
00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.500
I will praise an eel with the same praise.

171
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.100
What, that an eel is ingenious?

172
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.300
That an eel is quick.

173
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.300
I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.

174
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.200
I am answered, sir.

175
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.370
I love not to be crossed.

176
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.870
You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.

177
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.100
I confess both: they are both the varnish of a

178
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.230
complete man.

179
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:34.430
I have promised to study three years with the duke.

180
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:39.600
But I hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is

181
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.270
base for a soldier to love,

182
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:46.170
so am I in love with a base wench.

183
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.730
If drawing my sword against the humour

184
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.300
of affection would deliver me from the reprobate

185
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.700
thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner,

186
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.200
and ransom him to any French courtier

187
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.000
for a new-devised courtesy.

188
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:10.970
I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should outswear Cupid.

189
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:19.070
Comfort, me, boy: what great men have been in love?

190
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.000
Hercules, master.

191
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.400
Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy,

192
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.100
name more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good

193
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.170
repute and carriage.

194
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.600
Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage,

195
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.300
great carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back

196
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.930
like a porter: and he was in love.

197
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.870
O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson!

198
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.600
I do excel thee in my rapier

199
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.030
as thou didst me in carrying gates.

200
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:55.030
I am in love too.

201
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.230
Who was Samson's love, my dear Moth?

202
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.570
A woman, master.

203
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.300
Of what complexion?

204
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.130
Of the sea-water green, sir.

205
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.270
Is that one of the four complexions?

206
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.000
As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.

207
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.330
I do love that country girl that I took in the

208
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:21.400
park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.

209
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:29.230
My spirit grows heavy in love.

210
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.670
A letter from the magnificent Armado.

211
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.070
How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.

212
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.930
A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!

213
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.370
To hear? or forbear hearing?

214
00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.530
The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.

215
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.230
The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.

216
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.370
In what manner?

217
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.770
In manner and form following, sir; all those three:

218
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.770
I was seen with her in the manor-house,

219
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.930
sitting with her upon the form,

220
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.100
and taken following her into the park;

221
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.930
which, put together, is in manner and form following.

222
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.500
Now, sir, for the manner,--

223
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.630
it is the manner of a man to speak to a woman:

224
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.270
for the form,-- in some form.

225
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.700
For the following, sir?

226
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.030
As it shall follow in my correction:

227
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.300
and God defend the right!

228
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.700
Will you hear this letter with attention?

229
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.670
As we would hear an oracle.

230
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.730
Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.

231
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.500
'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and

232
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.100
sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,

233
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.230
and body's fostering patron.'

234
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:41.530
Not a word of Costard yet.

235
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.500
'So it is,'--

236
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.830
It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is,

237
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.670
in telling true, but so.

238
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.670
Peace!

239
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.270
Be to me and every man that dares not fight!

240
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.570
No words!

241
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:55.570
Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.

242
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.970
'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured melancholy,

243
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.100
I did commend the black-oppressing humour

244
00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.230
to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving air;

245
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:09.770
and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to walk.

246
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.700
The time when. About the sixth hour;

247
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.070
when beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down

248
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.770
to that nourishment which is called supper:

249
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.170
so much for the time when. Now for the ground which;

250
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:28.900
which, I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park.

251
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.170
Then for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter

252
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.230
that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth

253
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.530
from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink,

254
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:41.230
which here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;

255
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.270
but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east

256
00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:48.230
and by east from the west corner of thy curious-

257
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:52.630
knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited

258
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.900
swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'--

259
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:55.670
Who?

260
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:56.670
Me?

261
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.430
'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'--

262
00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.870
Me?

263
00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.030
'that shallow vassal,'--

264
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.530
Still me?

265
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.230
'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--

266
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.300
O, me!

267
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.730
'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy

268
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.800
established proclaimed edict and continent canon,

269
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.870
which with,--O, with--

270
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.330
but with this I passion to say wherewith,--

271
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.530
With a wench.

272
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:22.600
'with a child of our grandmother Eve,

273
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:30.930
a female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a woman.

274
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.330
Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,

275
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.070
have sent to thee, to receive the meed of punishment,

276
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.430
by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony Dull;

277
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.600
a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and estimation.'

278
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.170
'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.

279
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:48.370
'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel

280
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.470
called which I apprehended with the aforesaid swain,--

281
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.000
I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury;

282
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.030
and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice,

283
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:58.700
bring her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted

284
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.570
and heart-burning heat of duty.

285
00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.700
ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'

286
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.630
This is not so well as I looked for, but the best

287
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:06.970
that ever I heard.

288
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.430
Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah,

289
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.000
what say you to this?

290
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.030
Sir, I confess the wench.

291
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.300
Did you hear the proclamation?

292
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.300
I do confess much of the hearing it but little of

293
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.930
the marking of it.

294
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.230
It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment,

295
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.400
to be taken with a wench.

296
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.900
I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.

297
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.330
Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'

298
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.700
This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.

299
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.500
It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'

300
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.530
If it were, I deny her virginity:

301
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:34.330
I was taken with a maid.

302
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.200
This maid will not serve your turn, sir.

303
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.070
This maid will serve my turn, sir.

304
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.800
Sir, I will pronounce your sentence:

305
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.100
you shall fast a week with bran and water.

306
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.930
I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.

307
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.730
And Don Armado shall be your keeper.

308
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.830
My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:

309
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:21.030
Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard safe:

310
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.930
and you must suffer him to take no delight

311
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:28.600
nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.

312
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.830
For this damsel, I must keep her at the park:

313
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.870
she is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.

314
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:39.770
I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!

315
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.170
Man?

316
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.830
I will visit thee at the lodge.

317
00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:50.530
That's hereby.

318
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:51.870
I know where it is situate.

319
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.230
Lord, how wise you are!

320
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:57.300
I will tell thee wonders.

321
00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.900
With that face?

322
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.370
I love thee.

323
00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.230
So I heard you say.

324
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.730
And so, farewell.

325
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.730
Fair weather after you!

326
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.630
Come, Jaquenetta, away!

327
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.470
Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences

328
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:13.600
ere thou be pardoned.

329
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.730
Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a

330
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:15.800
full stomach.

331
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.330
Thou shalt be heavily punished.

332
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.100
I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they

333
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:22.470
are but lightly rewarded.

334
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:26.700
Take away this villain; shut him up.

335
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.230
Come, you transgressing slave; away!

336
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:33.130
Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.

337
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.800
No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.

338
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.730
Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation

339
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.570
that I have seen, some shall see.

340
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:42.900
What shall some see?

341
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.670
Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.

342
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.570
It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their words;

343
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.200
and therefore I will say nothing: I thank

344
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.100
God I have as little patience as another man;

345
00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.470
and therefore I can be quiet.

346
00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.400
I do affect the very ground, which is base,

347
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.170
where her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot,

348
00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:10.070
which is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn,

349
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:13.970
which is a great argument of falsehood, if I love.

350
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:17.330
And how can that be true love which is falsely attempted?

351
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.800
Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:

352
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:25.030
there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so tempted,

353
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:29.600
and he had an excellent strength;

354
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.900
yet was Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.

355
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.770
Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;

356
00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:44.370
and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.

357
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.530
Adieu, valour! rust rapier!

358
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:54.770
be still, drum! for your manager is in love;

359
00:18:54.770 --> 00:19:05.430
yea, he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,

360
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:13.970
for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;

361
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:23.630
write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.

362
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.630
