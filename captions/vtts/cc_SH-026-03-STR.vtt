00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.370
IS BANQUO GONE FROM COURT?

181
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.430
AYE, MADAM, BUT RETURNS AGAIN TONIGHT.

182
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.070
SAY TO THE KING

183
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.070
I WOULD ATTEND HIS LEISURE FOR A FEW WORDS.

184
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.670
MADAM, I WILL.

185
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:13.570
NAUGHT'S HAD, ALL'S SPENT,

186
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:18.200
WHERE OUR DESIRE IS GOT WITHOUT CONTENT.

187
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.770
'TIS SAFER TO BE THAT WHICH WE DESTROY

188
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:26.400
THAN BY DESTRUCTION DWELL IN DOUBTFUL JOY.

189
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.730
HOW NOW, MY LORD?

190
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.900
WHY DO YOU KEEP ALONE,

191
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.570
OF SORRIEST FANCIES YOUR COMPANIONS MAKING,

192
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.030
USING THOSE THOUGHTS WHICH SHOULD INDEED HAVE DIED

193
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.830
WITH THEM THEY THINK ON?

194
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.000
THINGS WITHOUT ALL REMEDY SHOULD BE WITHOUT REGARD.

195
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.030
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

196
00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.070
WE HAVE SCORCHED THE SNAKE,

197
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.400
NOT KILLED IT.

198
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.800
SHE'LL CLOSE AND BE HERSELF,

199
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.800
WHILES OUR POOR MALICE REMAINS IN DANGER

200
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.570
OF HER FORMER TOOTH.

201
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.130
BUT LET THE FRAME OF THINGS DISJOINT,

202
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.300
BOTH THE WORLDS SUFFER,

203
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.570
ERE WE WILL EAT OUR MEAL IN FEAR

204
00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.370
AND SLEEP IN THE AFFLICTION OF THESE TERRIBLE DREAMS

205
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.770
THAT SHAKE US NIGHTLY.

206
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.130
BETTER TO BE WITH THE DEAD,

207
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.100
WHOM WE, TO GAIN OUR PEACE, HAVE SENT TO PEACE,

208
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.300
THAN ON THE TORTURE OF THE MIND TO LIE IN RESTLESS ECSTASY.

209
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.330
AH, DUNCAN IS IN HIS GRAVE.

210
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.600
AFTER LIFE'S FITFUL FEVER, HE SLEEPS WELL.

211
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.570
TREASON HAS DONE HIS WORST.

212
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.200
NOR STEEL, NOR POISON, MALICE DOMESTIC,

213
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.900
FOREIGN LEVY, NOTHING, CAN TOUCH HIM FURTHER.

214
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.670
COME ON.

215
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.370
GENTLE MY LORD,

216
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.570
SLEEK O'ER YOUR RUGGED LOOKS.

217
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.670
BE BRIGHT AND JOVIAL AMONG YOUR GUESTS TONIGHT.

218
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.400
SO SHALL I, LOVE, AND SO, I PRAY, BE YOU.

219
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.130
LET YOUR REMEMBRANCE APPLY TO BANQUO.

220
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.030
PRESENT HIM EMINENCE BOTH WITH EYE AND TONGUE:

221
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.300
UNSAFE THE WHILE,

222
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.170
THAT WE MUST LAVE OUR HONORS IN THESE FLATTERING STREAMS,

223
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.100
MAKING OUR FACES VIZARDS TO OUR HEARTS,

224
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.500
DISGUISING WHAT THEY ARE!

225
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.930
YOU MUST LEAVE THIS!

226
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.230
FULL OF SCORPIONS IS MY MIND, DEAR WIFE!

227
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.370
THOU KNOWEST THAT BANQUO AND HIS FLEANCE LIVES.

228
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.230
BUT IN THEM NATURE'S COPY'S NOT ETERNE.

229
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.730
AYE, THERE'S COMFORT YET.

230
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.570
THEY ARE ASSAILABLE.

231
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.530
[gasping]

232
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.630
THEN BE THOU JOCUND.

233
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.470
ERE THE BAT HATH FLOWN HIS CLOISTERED FLIGHT,

234
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:51.700
ERE TO BLACK HECAT'S SUMMONS THE SHARD-BORNE BEETLE

235
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:56.070
WITH HIS DROWSY HUMS HATH RUNG NIGHT'S YAWNING PEAL,

236
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:59.030
THERE SHALL BE DONE A DEED OF DREADFUL NOTE.

237
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.900
WHAT'S TO BE DONE?

238
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.330
THEY--

239
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.200
BE INNOCENT OF THE KNOWLEDGE, DEAREST CHUCK,

240
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.300
TILL THOU APPLAUD THE DEED.

241
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:20.130
COME, SEELING NIGHT,

242
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.970
SCARF UP THE TENDER EYE OF PITIFUL DAY,

243
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.700
AND WITH THY BLOODY AND INVISIBLE HAND

244
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.270
CANCEL AND TEAR TO PIECES THAT GREAT BOND

245
00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.130
WHICH KEEPS ME PALE.

246
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:36.500
LIGHT THICKENS,

247
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.500
AND THE CROW MAKES WING TO THE ROOKY WOOD.

248
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.730
GOOD THINGS OF DAY BEGIN TO DROOP AND DROWSE,

249
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.030
WHILES NIGHT'S BLACK AGENTS

250
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.100
TO THEIR PREYS DO ROUSE.

251
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.630
AND--

252
00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.900
THOU MARVEL'ST AT MY WORDS,

253
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.800
BUT HOLD THEE STILL.

254
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.870
THINGS BAD BEGUN MAKE STRONG THEMSELVES...

255
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.730
BY ILL.

256
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.470
SO, PRITHEE.

257
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.270

[breathing heavily]

260
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.670
WHO DID BID THEE JOIN WITH US?

261
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.130
MACBETH.

262
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.470
HE NEEDS NOT OUR MISTRUST,

263
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:55.470
SINCE HE DELIVERS OUR OFFICES,

264
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:58.370
AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, TO THE DIRECTION JUST.

265
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.130
[thunder rumbling]

266
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.030
THEN STAND WITH US.

267
00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.530
THE WEST YET GLIMMERS WITH SOME STREAKS OF DAY.

268
00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.030
NOW SPURS THE LATED TRAVELER APACE

269
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.770
TO GAIN THE TIMELY INN,

270
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.600
AND NEAR, THE SUBJECT OF OUR WATCH APPROACHES.

271
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.600
[horses whinny]

272
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.800
[softly] I HEAR HORSES.

273
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.730
(Banquo)  GIVE US A LIGHT THERE!  HO!

274
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.270
THEN 'TIS HE.

275
00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.470
THE REST WITHIN EXPECTATION ARE IN THE COURT.

276
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.170
HIS HORSES GO ABOUT.

277
00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:26.500
ALMOST A MILE.

278
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.630
BUT HE DOES USUALLY, FROM HENCE TO THE PALACE GATE WALK.

279
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.000

280
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.100

281
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.630
STAND TO 'T.

283
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.100
IT WILL BE RAIN TONIGHT.

284
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.770
LET IT COME DOWN!

285
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.170
TREACHERY!

286
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.770
[grunting]

287
00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.200
FLY, GOOD FLEANCE!  FLY!

288
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.000
FLY!  FLY!

289
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.300
THOU MAYEST REVENGE!

290
00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.100
[grunts]

291
00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.370
O SLAVE!

292
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.630
WHO DID STRIKE OUT THE LIGHT?

293
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:14.830
WAS 'T NOT THE WAY?

294
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.370
THERE'S BUT ONE DOWN; THE SON IS FLED.

295
00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:19.300
WE HAVE LOST THE BEST HALF OF OUR AFFAIR.

296
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.500
WELL, LET'S AWAY AND SAY HOW MUCH IS DONE.

297
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.500

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:40.100


299
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.400
YOU KNOW YOUR OWN DEGREES. SIT DOWN.

300
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.300
AT FIRST AND LAST, A HEARTY WELCOME.

301

THANKS TO YOUR MAJESTY.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.130
OURSELF WILL MINGLE WITH SOCIETY

AND PLAY THE HUMBLE HOST.

304
00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.700
OUR HOSTESS KEEPS HER STATE,

305
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.530
BUT IN BEST TIME WE WILL REQUIRE HER WELCOME.

306
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.070
PRONOUNCE IT FOR ME, SIR, TO ALL OUR FRIENDS,

307
00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.300
FOR MY HEART SPEAKS, "THEY ARE WELCOME."

309
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.270
SEE, THEY ENCOUNTER THEE WITH THEIR HEARTS' THANKS.

310
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.800
NOW WE'LL DRINK A MEASURE THE TABLE ROUND.

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.330
[applause]

312
00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:23.530

316
00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:30.970
AYE, MY LORD.

HIS THROAT IS CUT. THAT I DID FOR HIM.

320
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.630

321
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.300
MOST ROYAL SIR, FLEANCE IS 'SCAPED.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.770
AS BROAD AND GENERAL AS THE CASING AIR.

327
00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.730
BUT NOW I'M CABINED, CRIBBED, CONFINED,

328
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.630

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:13.670
WHERE?

359
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:14.500
HERE, MY GOOD LORD.

360
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:20.530
[gasps]

361
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.300
WHAT IS IT THAT MOVES YOUR HIGHNESS?

362
00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:29.870
WHICH OF YOU HAVE DONE THIS?

363
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.130
(man)  WHAT, MY GOOD LORD?

364
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.700
[gasps]

365
00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.000
THOU CANST NOT SAY I DID IT.

366
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.970
NEVER SHAKE  THY GORY LOCKS AT ME!

367
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:42.170
GENTLEMEN, RISE. HIS HIGHNESS IS NOT WELL.

368
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.330
SIT, WORTHY FRIENDS.

369
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.270
MY LORD IS OFTEN THUS,

370
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.600
AND HATH BEEN FROM HIS YOUTH.

371
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.130
PRAY YOU KEEP SEAT.

372
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:51.670
THE FIT IS MOMENTARY.

373
00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.500
UPON A THOUGHT HE WILL AGAIN BE WELL.

374
00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.630
IF MUCH YOU NOTE HIM,

375
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.930
YOU SHALL OFFEND HIM AND EXTEND HIS PASSION.

376
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.930
FEED, AND REGARD HIM NOT.

377
00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:01.930
[whispering] Are you a man?

378
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.100
AYE, AND A BOLD ONE,

379
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.570
THAT DARE LOOK ON THAT WHICH MIGHT APPALL THE DEVIL!

380
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.870
OH, PROPER STUFF!

381
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.830
THIS IS THE VERY PAINTING OF YOUR FEAR.

382
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.500
THIS IS THE AIR-DRAWN DAGGER

383
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.200
WHICH YOU SAID LED YOU TO DUNCAN.

384
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.770
OH, THESE FLAWS AND STARTS, IMPOSTORS TO TRUE FEAR,

385
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.970
WOULD WELL BECOME A WOMAN'S STORY AT A FIRE,

386
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.930
AUTHORIZED BY HER GRANDAM.

387
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.770
SHAME ITSELF, WHY DO YOU MAKE SUCH FACES?

388
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:30.170
WHEN ALL'S DONE, YOU LOOK BUT ON A STOOL.

389
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.430
PRITHEE SEE THERE!

390
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.600
BEHOLD!  LOOK!  LO! ALL SAY YOU?

391
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.170
WHY, WHAT CARE I?

392
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.300
IF THOU CANST NOD, SPEAK TOO!

393
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.070
IF CHARNEL HOUSES AND OUR GRAVES

394
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.800
MUST SEND THOSE THAT WE BURY BACK,

395
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.870
OUR MONUMENTS SHALL BE THE MAWS OF KITES!

396
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.600
WHAT?  QUITE UNMANNED IN FOLLY?

397
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.300
[panting]

398
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.500
IF--IF I STAND HERE, I SAW HIM.

399
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.800
FIE, FOR SHAME!

400
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.200
THE TIME HAS BEEN, THAT WHEN THE BRAINS WERE OUT,

401
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.900
THE MAN WOULD DIE, AND THERE AN END.

402
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.470
BUT NOW THEY RISE AGAIN

403
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.400
WITH 20 MORTAL MURDERS ON THEIR CROWNS,

404
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.800
AND PUSH US FROM OUR STOOLS.

405
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.330
THIS IS MORE STRANGE THAN SUCH A MURDER IS.

406
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:11.870
[both panting]

407
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.870
MY WORTHY LORD,

408
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:23.470
YOUR NOBLE FRIENDS DO LACK YOU.

409
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:34.530
I DO FORGET.

410
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:39.270
DO NOT MUSE AT ME, MY MOST WORTHY FRIENDS.

411
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.670
I HAVE A STRANGE INFIRMITY,

412
00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.200
WHICH IS NOTHING TO THOSE THAT KNOW ME.

413
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.170
COME, LOVE AND HEALTH TO ALL!

414
00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:49.530
THEN I'LL SIT DOWN.

415
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.200
COME, GIVE ME SOME WINE.

416
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.130
FILL FULL.

417
00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.230
I DRINK TO THE GENERAL JOY OF THE WHOLE TABLE,

418
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:03.630
AND TO OUR DEAR FRIEND BANQUO,

419
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.400
WHOM WE MISS.

420
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.630
WOULD HE WERE HERE.

421
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:10.000
TO ALL, AND HIM, WE THIRST,

422
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.370
AND ALL TO ALL!

423
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.370
OUR DUTIES AND THE PLEDGE!

424
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:16.430
(all) THE PLEDGE!

425
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.300
AVAUNT, AND QUIT MY SIGHT!

426
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.370
LET THE EARTH HIDE THEE!

427
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:26.000
THY BONES ARE MARROWLESS, THY BLOOD IS COLD.

428
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.470
THOU HAST NO SPECULATION IN THOSE EYES

429
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.200
WHICH THOU DOST GLARE WITH!

430
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.600
THINK OF THIS, GOOD PEERS,

431
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.400
BUT AS A THING OF CUSTOM.

432
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.000
'TIS NO OTHER.

433
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.300
ONLY IT SPOILS THE PLEASURE OF THE TIME.

434
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.530
WHAT MAN DARE, I DARE.

435
00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:43.270
APPROACH THOU LIKE THE RUGGED RUSSIAN BEAR,

436
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:46.400
THE ARMED RHINOCEROS, OR THE HYRCAN TIGER.

437
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.900
TAKE ANY SHAPE BUT THAT,

438
00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.530
AND MY FIRM NERVES SHALL NEVER TREMBLE!

439
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:54.530
OR BE ALIVE AGAIN, AND DARE ME TO THE DESERT WITH THY SWORD!

440
00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:59.300
IF TREMBLING I INHABIT THEN, PROTEST ME THE BABY OF A GIRL!

441
00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:05.630
HENCE, HORRIBLE SHADOW!

442
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:09.270
UNREAL MOCKERY!

443
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.630
HENCE!

444
00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:28.130


445
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:31.130
[breathing heavily]

446
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.270
WHY, SO.

447
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.430
BEING GONE, I AM A MAN AGAIN.

448
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:52.770
PRAY YOU, SIT STILL.

449
00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:57.130
YOU HAVE DISPLACED THE MIRTH,

450
00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.000
BROKE THE GOOD MEETING,

451
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.430
WITH MOST ADMIRED DISORDER.

452
00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:07.400
CAN SUCH THINGS BE,

453
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.730
AND OVERCOME US LIKE A SUMMER'S CLOUD,

454
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.700
WITHOUT OUR SPECIAL WONDER?

455
00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.800
[Macbeth chuckles]

456
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.730
YOU MAKE ME STRANGE EVEN TO THAT DISPOSITION THAT I OWE,

457
00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:19.670
WHEN NOW I THINK YOU CAN BEHOLD SUCH SIGHTS

458
00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:21.770
AND KEEP THE NATURAL RUBY OF YOUR CHEEKS,

459
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:23.430
WHILE MINE IS BLANCHED WITH FEAR.

460
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:24.530
WHAT SIGHTS?

461
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:26.130
I PRAY YOU SPEAK NOT!

462
00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:27.700
HE GROWS WORSE AND WORSE!

463
00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.630
QUESTION  ENRAGES HIM.

464
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:30.930
AT ONCE, GOOD NIGHT.

465
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.400
STAND NOT UPON THE ORDER OF YOUR GOING, BUT GO AT ONCE!

466
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.500
GOOD NIGHT,

467
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.770
AND BETTER HEALTH ATTEND HIS MAJESTY!

468
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:41.130
A KIND GOOD NIGHT TO ALL!

469
00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:10.270


470
00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:15.030
IT WILL HAVE BLOOD, THEY SAY.

471
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:18.730
BLOOD WILL HAVE BLOOD.

472
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.230
STONES HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO MOVE

473
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.470
AND TREES TO SPEAK.

474
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.400
AUGURS AND UNDERSTOOD RELATIONS

475
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.070
HAVE BY MAGGOT PIES AND CHOUGHS AND ROOKS

476
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:34.100
BROUGHT FORTH THE SECRET'ST MAN OF BLOOD.

477
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.130
WHAT IS THE NIGHT?

478
00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:42.100
ALMOST AT ODDS WITH MORNING, WHICH IS WHICH.

479
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:42.930
HOW SAY'ST THOU,

480
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.430
THAT MACDUFF DENIES HIS PERSON

481
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.130
AT OUR GREAT BIDDING?

482
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.770
DID YOU... SEND TO HIM, SIR?

483
00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.070
I HEAR IT BY THE WAY.

484
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.200
THERE'S NOT A ONE OF THEM

485
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.170
BUT IN HIS HOUSE I KEEP A SERVANT FEED.

486
00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.530
BUT I WILL SEND; I WILL TOMORROW.

487
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.400
AND BETIMES I WILL TO THE WEIRD SISTERS.

488
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.130
MORE THEY SHALL SPEAK.

489
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:06.330
FOR NOW I AM BENT TO KNOW BY THE WORST MEANS,

490
00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:07.470
THE WORST!

491
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:10.270
FOR MINE OWN GOOD ALL CAUSES SHALL GIVE WAY!

492
00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.300
[clattering]

493
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.470
I AM IN BLOOD...

494
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:20.870
STEPPED IN...

495
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:24.130
SO FAR...

496
00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:28.530
THAT SHOULD I WADE IN NO MORE,

497
00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.700
RETURNING...

498
00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.700
WERE AS TEDIOUS AS GO O'ER.

499
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.670
STRANGE THINGS I HAVE IN HEAD THAT WILL TO HAND,

500
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.270
WHICH MUST BE ACTED ERE THEY MAY BE SCANNED.

501
00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:45.430
YOU LACK THE SEASON OF ALL NATURES,

502
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:49.300
SLEEP.

503
00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.430
HA!

504
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.800
COME!

505
00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:01.000
WE'LL TO SLEEP.

506
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.300
MY STRANGE AND SELF-ABUSE IS THE INITIATE FEAR

507
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.630
THAT WANTS HARD USE.

508
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.530
WE...

509
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.030
ARE YET BUT YOUNG...

510
00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:18.800
IN DEED.

511
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:35.700


512
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.700
