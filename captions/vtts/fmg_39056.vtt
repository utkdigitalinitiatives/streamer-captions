WEBVTT

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Man: OK. YOUR
BANK CARD IS
IN THERE.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
ALL YOUR
INSTRUCTIONS
ARE IN THERE, OK?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
ALL RIGHT.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
THERE'S YOUR
PAPERWORK,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
AND THERE'S YOUR
SAFE SEX KIT.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
[BUZZ]

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
WHOO.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
WHAT DID YOU COME
UP FOR THIS TIME?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
D.C.S., DELIVERY
OF A CONTROLLED
SUBSTANCE.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT. OK.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
THAT'S WHAT I
THOUGHT IT WAS.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
WE'RE GONNA GO
OVER HERE.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
OOH.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
SO HOW YOU FEEL
GETTING OUT OF THERE?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
PRETTY GOOD.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
HOW MANY MONTHS
WAS IT?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
HUH?
HOW MANY MONTHS?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
UH, I WAS SENTENCED
TO 41 MONTHS.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
41? WHOA.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Man, voice-over:
YOU KNOW, IN THE PAST,
I WAS KIND OF AMBIVALENT

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
AS TOWARDS MY CHANCES
OF STAYING OUT.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I HAD GOOD INTENTIONS,
BUT I JUST DIDN'T--

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I JUST DIDN'T FEEL
IT IN HERE.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
THIS TIME AROUND,
I'VE REGAINED

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
A POSITIVE SELF-IMAGE,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
AND SO WHAT HAPPENS
IN MY LIFE REALLY
DOES MATTER TO ME.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
YOU KNOW, THAT MAY SOUND
KIND OF SIMPLISTIC,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
BUT, YOU KNOW, NOBODY
SAID SUCCESS HAS
TO BE COMPLICATED.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
MY NAME IS
MARQUITA SCOTT.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I'M A PAROLE/PROBATION
OFFICER FOR MULTNOMAH COUNTY

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
FOR THE AFRICAN AMERICAN
PROGRAM.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
THIS IS NATHANIEL ROBERTS.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
HE'S ALSO A PAROLE/PROBATION
OFFICER,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
AND THIS IS THANH VU,
ALSO KNOWN AS NATE.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
HE'S A CORRECTIONS
COUNSELOR.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
DO YOU WANT TO DO
THE INTRODUCTION
AS TO WHAT

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
THE AFRICAN AMERICAN
PROGRAM IS?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
ACTUALLY, THEY ALL
SHOULD KNOW.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT
THE AFRICAN AMERICAN
PROGRAM IS ALL ABOUT?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
YOU GUYS HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
SOME OF YOU GUYS DO.
I KNOW. I'VE MET
SOME OF YOU GUYS.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
WHAT I KNOW
ABOUT IS
YOU GUYS

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
HELP US GET BACK
INTO THE COMMUNITY
THAT WE FELL OUT OF

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
AND HELP US MAKE
SURE THAT WE
GET JOBS,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
WE HAVE HOUSING.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
THIS AFRO AMERICAN
PROGRAM HELP, TOO,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
BECAUSE IT HELPS
YOU WITH YOUR
FAMILY, TOO.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN DOWN,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN AWAY
FROM THEIR FAMILY,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
AND, LIKE, NOW--
AS YOU SEE NOW,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
THEY GOT US
WAY OUT HERE,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
AND WE'RE FAR AWAY
FROM OUR FAMILY NOW.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I WANT THIS PROGRAM
BECAUSE, LIKE I SAY,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
YOU KNOW, I'M PART
OF THE COMMUNITY,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
AND I WANT TO
GET BACK INTO
THE COMMUNITY,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
AND I DON'T WANT TO
DEAL WITH THIS
NO MORE.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
LIKE I SAY, I WAS
OUT FOR 10 YEARS.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I'M NOT TRYING
TO COME BACK
WHEN I GET OUT.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
WE CARE ABOUT YOU
NOT COMING BACK TO PRISON

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
OR GOING TO JAIL
OR VIOLATING YOU,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
SO IF YOU GOT PROBLEMS,
YOU CAN COME TO YOUR P.O.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
WHEN BEFORE YOU PROBABLY
THOUGHT, "I CAN'T GO
TO MY P.O. AND SAY

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
"I'M USING,
I NEED TO GO
TO DRUG TREATMENT,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
BECAUSE IF I DO
THEN I'M GOING TO JAIL."

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Roberts: HOW MANY
GUYS IN HERE

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
HAS BEEN IN HERE
MORE THAN ONCE,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
BEEN IN PRISON
MORE THAN ONCE?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
SHOW OF HANDS.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
MORE THAN ONCE,
MORE THAN ONCE,
MORE THAN ONCE.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
YOU WANT TO
COME BACK HERE
AGAIN EVER?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
IT SEEMS LIKE
A DUMB QUESTION,
BUT IT'S FUNNY--

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
IT'S REAL, THOUGH.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
YEAH. IT'S REAL REAL
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
FIRST THING YOU
SAY WHEN YOU GET
OUT OF HERE,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
"MAN, I AIN'T
NEVER COMING BACK
TO THAT PLACE.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
IT'S A PIT.
I AIN'T NEVER
GOING BACK THERE."

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
YOU WILL BITE
YOUR TONGUE
AND EAT YOUR WORDS

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
WHEN YOU WALK
OUT OF HERE

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
AND YOU'RE THINKING
THE SAME WAY

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
AND ACTING
THE SAME WAY
YOU ACTED

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
PRIOR TO GETTING
IN HERE.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT
ARE HERE NEED TO BE HERE,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE HERE
THAT NEED SOME SUPPORT,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
SOME EDUCATION,
AND SOME DIRECTION.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
WE TALK ABOUT CORRECTION
AND REHABILITATION,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
AND COMING FROM SOME COMMUNITIES
AND SOME SOCIETIES,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
SOME PEOPLE HAVE
NEVER BEE HABILITATED,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
SO HOW CAN YOU
REHABILITATE THEM?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
SO WE HAVE TO GET INTO ACTUALLY
TRAINING A YOUNG MAN

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
ON HOW TO BE YOUNG MAN,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
AND THAT GOES
ACROSS THE CULTURAL LINES.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
YOU KNOW, SOME OF THESE GUYS
JUST DON'T HAVE ANY GUIDANCE.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
RANDY WEST.
ABOUT 28 DAYS
TO THE DOOR,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.000
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
IT'S BEEN A LONG
TIME COMING.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I'VE BEEN ANXIOUS
EVER SINCE I GOT HERE,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
SO, YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
HEH HEH HEH!
I HEARD THAT.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
SO IT'S A FEELING,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
YOU GO THROUGH
A LOT OF DIFFERENT
EMOTIONS

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
WHEN YOU'RE GETTING
CLOSE TO THE DOOR.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
IT'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS
AND REQUESTIONS

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
AND MORE QUESTIONS
THAT YOU GOT ASK YOURSELF

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOU'RE PREPARED

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
AND READY TO GO FACE
THE REAL--TO GO
FACE THE WORLD, SO...

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Vu: HOW LONG
YOU BEEN DOWN?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I'VE BEEN DOWN
16 YEARS,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
SO I CAN SAY THAT I
PROBABLY DID THE MOST TIME

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
OUT OF ALL OF US
IN HERE,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
AND SO, YOU KNOW,
I'M JUST GETTING PREPARED,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
READY TO GO OUT THERE
AND FACE IT.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I HAVE TO BE CONSCIOUS
OF MY FRIENDS.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I HAVE TO BE CONSCIOUS
OF THE PEOPLE I COME
IN CONTACT WITH.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
IT'S A LOT OF VARIABLES
OUT THERE THAT YOU HAVE
TO REALLY WATCH OUT FOR

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT'S
BEHIND YOU.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
BEHIND YOU IS YOU GOING
RIGHT BACK THROUGH
THOSE SAME DOORS

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
THAT YOU WENT
THROUGH BEFORE,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
AND THERE'S A PRISON BED
WAITING FOR YOU.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Vu: RANDY HAS TWO CHOICES
IN LIFE WHEN HE WALKS OUT.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
FIRST OF ALL, HE'S A LIFER,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
SO THE PAROLE BOARD'S GONNA BE
LOOKING AT HIM VERY SERIOUSLY.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
IF HE SCREWS UP,
THEY CAN YANK HIS CHAIN

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
AND BRING HIM BACK
FOR THE REMAINDER
OF HIS LIFE.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Man: SEEING YOURSELF
GET THROUGH THE FINISH LINE.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
MY NAME IS CALVIN HARPER.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I GOT TWO MORE MEETINGS LEFT,
AND I'LL BE OUT,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
AND I'M DOING OK.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I'M GETTING ANXIOUS
I'M GETTING RELEASED,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
BUT I'M DOING OK.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
24 MONTHS IS UP.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I GOT 3 WEEKS LEFT
BEFORE I GET OUT
THE FRONT DOOR,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
AND LIKE I SAY,
I CAN'T WAIT.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I'VE BEEN COMING
TO YOUR OFFICE
FOR HOW LONG, A YEAR?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
AND THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME--

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I HAVE BEEN SCAMMING YOU,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA SCAM
YOU NO MORE.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
HAVE YOU BEEN
DRINKING TODAY?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
TODAY? NO.
I CAN'T TELL A LIE. NO.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
LAST NIGHT,
IF YOU'D HAVE
CAME TO THE HOUSE,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
BOY, YOU'D HAVE HAD A--

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
YEAH. I WOULD HAVE HAD
A BOTTLE ON THE TABLE.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
NOW. HAVE I EVER COME
CLEAN TO YOU THIS WAY?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
YES OR NO?
TELL THE TRUTH.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU,
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
COME TO MY OFFICE
THIS WAY.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
OK. YOU GOT ME.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I'D LIKE
A CRITIQUE OF THIS.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
WHAT COULD HE HAVE
DONE BETTER COMING
TO THE OFFICE?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
NOT LYING?
NOT LYING.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
GETTING CAUGHT
LYING.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
PRIOR TO THIS
WHOLE PIECE,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
YOU CAME IN
WITH A CON
ATTITUDE.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
YOU WANTED TO
GET OUT.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I FEEL LIKE HE--
HE DIDN'T WIN ME OVER
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
IN ALL ACTUALITY,
IF, IN FACT,
I WAS A P.O.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
UNFORTUNATELY,
AS BAD AS I'D
HATE TO SAY SO,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
THAT BUTTON WOULD HAVE
BEEN PUNCHED 2 OR 3 TIMES,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
THE TRUNK MONKEY
WOULD HAVE RAN OUT
AND GOT HIM BY NOW,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
AND YOU DEFINITELY
WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
ON YOUR WAY BACK
TO D.O.C.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Harper: SOME PEOPLE GET OUT
AND AIN'T GOT NOBODY.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I GOT TWO P.O.s
AND A COUNSELOR
AND MY FAMILY,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
SO I GOT SOMEBODY.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
IT'S NO EXCUSE FOR ME
TO COME BACK

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
BECAUSE I GOT
A SUPPORT SYSTEM,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
AND THAT'S WHAT
I NEEDED.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
ALL RIGHT. FIRST OF ALL,
WHO WHAT TO SHARE?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
LET'S START
WITH THIS TABLE.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
"LOOKING BACK
AT YOUR FAMILY TREE,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
"DESCRIBE SOME DYSFUNCTIONAL
THINGS IN YOUR FAMILY.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
AND WHAT YOU BELIEVE
TO HAVE CAUSED IT."

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
THE DYSFUNCTIONAL
IN MY FAMILY,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I LOOK AT IT AS
COMING FROM ME.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I GREW UP
IN A FOSTER HOME,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
NEVER KNEW MY MOTHER,
NEVER KNEW MY FATHER,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
EVEN THOUGH I RAN AWAY
FROM MY FATHER

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
WITH MY TWO SISTERS
AT THE AGE OF, UH,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
SOMETHING LIKE
6, 7 YEARS OLD.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
NOW LET'S GO DEEPER
IF YOU CAN SHARE THAT.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
WHY DID YOU RUN AWAY
FROM HOME?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
UM, HE WAS
AN ABUSIVE DUDE.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
EVERYBODY HAVE THEIR
LITTLE ABUSE STORY,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
WHERE THEY GOT WHUPPED
WITH THIS AND THAT,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
EXTENSION CORDS,
FISHING POLES,
WHATEVER, YOU KNOW,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
BUT, I MEAN, I COULDN'T
EVEN BE IN THE SAME ROOM

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
WITH HIM WITHOUT
FINDING MYSELF--

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
PICKING MYSELF UP
OFF THE FLOOR,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
YOU KNOW, FOR NO REASON.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
WOULD YOU SEE THAT--
JUST WHAT YOU
EXPLAINED REALLY,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
WOULD THAT ACTUALLY
BE A DYSFUNCTION THEN?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T
TELL ME THAT

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
ON A NORMAL,
NONDYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
THAT THE FATHER
NORMALLY BEATS HIS KIDS

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
AS YOU ARE
DESCRIBING HERE.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
SO ACTUALLY, IT STARTED
FROM YOUR PARENTS DOWN.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I NEVER ACTUALLY
REALIZED THAT.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
LACK OF PARENTING
IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS
AS THIS POINT.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
HOW MANY KIDS--
COULD YOU SHARE
THAT WITH US--

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
HOW MANY KIDS
DO YOU HAVE?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
LIKE 8. 7, 8 KIDS.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
YOU SEE A PATTERN
AS FAR AS LACK
OF PARENTING,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
IF THAT IS AN ISSUE,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
AND HOW IT CAN
REPEAT ITSELF?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
YEAH.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
IN C.R.C.I.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
WE'LL GET IT.
WE'LL PICK IT
UP LATER.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
HAVE TO CALL THEM.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
ALL YOUR PROPERTY.
OH, YEAH.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
WOW. OK. WELL, WE'LL
PICK IT UP.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Campbell, voice-over:
YOU KNOW, BEFORE WHEN I
GOT OUT, I WAS NERVOUS

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
BECAUSE I REALLY DIDN'T
EVEN TRUST MYSELF.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
THIS TIME AROUND
BECAUSE OF WHAT

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
I EXPERIENCED
IN THE A.A.P.,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
IT GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
TO JUST LET ALL
THAT STUFF OUT

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
THAT'S BEEN KEEPING ME
GOING BACK TO THE BAG

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
FOR MANY YEARS NOW.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
YEP.
Woman: COME IN.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
HEY.
AHH!

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
RICHARD, HI!
HEY.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
HI.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
OH, OH, OH.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
OH, I'M SO GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
[SOBBING]

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
HI, DAD.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
HI, CHUBBY.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
CHUBBY? YEAH.
I GUESS SO.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
GOOD TO BE HOME.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
YOU GONNA STAY
HOME NOW?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
YEAH. YEAH, I AM.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT BEING OUT?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
PRETTY ... GOOD.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
WHO DID YOU FEEL
ABOUT BEING IN?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
PRETTY ... BAD.
HA HA!

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
YEAH. I DIDN'T LIKE
ONE MINUTE OF IT.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
NOT AT ALL.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
WE DIDN'T EITHER.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
YEAH. THIS TIME WAS
THE WORST EXPERIENCE
OF MY LIFE.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
WELL, I HOPE YOU
REALIZE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
THAT YOU HAVE
TO BE OUT.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
YEAH, I KNOW.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
YOU WASTED ALL
OF YOUR YOUTH,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
AND YOU WASTED MY YOUTH
AND MY FRIENDSHIP

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
BECAUSE THAT'S--

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
THAT'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING
TO A FATHER...

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
IS HIS SON'S
FRIENDSHIP.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
YOUR FRIENDSHIP,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
AND WHEN I BECAME
AN ADDICT,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
THAT'S ONE
OF THE THINGS
THAT REALLY HURT

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I COULDN'T--

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I WASN'T ABLE TO
RELATE TO YOU
IN THAT WAY,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
AND THAT HURT ME
AS MUCH AS IT
HURT YOU.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
BELIEVE THAT.
THERE WAS TIMES
WHEN I CRIED, TOO,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
OVER THAT MATTER
BECAUSE I MISSED--

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I MISSED YOUR
FRIENDSHIP.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I REALLY DID.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
CAN WE STILL
BE FRIENDS?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
YEAH. YEAH.
WE'RE FRIENDS, RICHARD.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
IT SOUNDS
KIND OF CORNY,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
BUT IT MEANS
A LOT TO ME.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
WELL, I THINK YOU GOT
THE WORST BEHIND YOU.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
YOU JUST HAVE TO
MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T
TAKE ANY MORE TIME.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
NO. I'M NOT GONNA
GIVE IT ANY MORE
TIME OUT OF MY LIFE.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
YEAH.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Hayes, voice-over:
BEFORE, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
"I AIN'T COMING BACK,
AND I'M NOT GONNA
USE DRUGS AGAIN."

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
THIS TIME AROUND,
IT'S JUST BEEN A DRASTIC CHANGE.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I GOT A LIFE TO LIVE,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
AND IT DOESN'T CONSIST
OF DOING IT FROM THE INSIDE.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
FEEL LIKE RUNNING.
HA HA HA!

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I CAN RUN.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
OH, THEY DONE
TORE THAT DOWN

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
AND REBUILT IT, HUH?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Woman: MM-HMM.
WHAT WAS THAT?
SKIPPER'S?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
SKIPPER'S. YEP.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
YEAH.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
OH. VILLAGE INN.
YEAH. OK.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
PANCAKES
AND SAUSAGE, BABY.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
THAT'S WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
EGGS OVER EASY.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Hayes: I'LL HAVE
A NUMBER TWO,
EARLY RISER.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
EGGS OVER EASY.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Roberts: YOUR
MOST RECENT OFFENSE
FOR BEING IN THERE

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
IS NOT
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
OR ASSAULT
TYPE STUFF.
WHAT WAS IT?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
BURG. II.
BURGLARY?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
YEAH.
OK.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
AND NO PHYSICAL
AGGRESSION
OR DRUGS?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
NONE.
OK.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Woman: HE'S NEVER
BEEN CHARGED

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
OF DOING A CRIME--
COMMITTING A CRIME TO ME.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
OK. OK.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
NEVER BEEN CHARGED.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
YOU JUST PUT
A RESTRAINING ORDER
IN AT THAT POINT

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
IN TIME TO TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.
MM-HMM.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
OK. ALL RIGHT.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Woman: SO TELL ME
A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THIS CHARGE,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
THE BURGLARY,
TAKING CASH OUT

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
OF A CASH DRAWER
IN A PARKING BOOTH.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
WHAT HAPPENED?
WERE YOU UNDER
THE INFLUENCE

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
OF INTOXICANTS
AT ALL?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
UH, NO.
I HADN'T BEEN DRINKING.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
NO DRINKING?
WHAT WAS GOING ON

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
WITH YOU
AT THAT TIME?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
JUST BAD JUDGMENT.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
WHAT WAS YOUR
INTENTION
FOR THE MONEY?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
WHAT WERE YOU
GONNA USE IT FOR?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
UM, GO GET A MOTEL.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
YOU HAD NOBODY YOU
COULD STAY WITH
AT THAT TIME?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
NOT AT THAT TIME.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
SO HOW LONG WERE YOU
ON THE STREETS

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
BEFORE YOU COMMITTED
THIS CRIME?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
I CAN'T BE SURE.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.000
WAS IT MONTHS, DAYS?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
NO. PROBABLY LIKE
A WEEK OR TWO.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
HAS THAT BEEN
AN ISSUE FOR YOU
IN THE PAST

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
AS FAR AS NOT HAVING
A PLACE TO STAY?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
YEAH.
IS THAT AN ONGOING
THING FOR YOU?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
YEAH. IT'S BEEN
PRETTY MUCH ALL MY LIFE.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I'VE NEVER HAD
MY OWN PLACE,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
AND I'VE REALLY BEEN
RELYING ON--
I HAVE TWO SISTERS,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
AND I'VE BEEN LIVING
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
AND THEN I STARTED
LIVING WITH THESE
DIFFERENT WOMEN,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
AND THEN, UH--

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO HAVE MY OWN PLACE,
I THINK, YOU KNOW.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
P.P.D.S. LISTS
A BUNCH

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
INCIDENTS,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
WHETHER OR NOT
THE POLICE CAME OUT
TO THE HOME

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
OR WHETHER
YOU WERE ARRESTED.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
WHAT WERE THOSE
ABOUT?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.000
THE DOMESTIC THING
EVOLVED AROUND THE DRUGS,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000
SEE, IT'S MORE OR LESS
THE CHOICES, THE WOMEN
THAT I CHOOSE.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THEY INSTIGATED
FIGHTS WITH YOU OR...

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
NO. WHAT I SAY--
WHAT I SAY
WHEN I SAY THAT

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
IS THAT, YOU KNOW,
I TOLERATE A WOMAN
THAT'S ON DRUGS

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
IF I'M NOT ON DRUGS.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
AND THEN THE LAST
THING TODAY IS

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I'M GONNA WALK
YOU BACK OUT
TO THE LOBBY.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
HAVE A SEAT.
I'LL LET THEM KNOW

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
YOU'RE WAITING
FOR HOUSING,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
AND HOPEFULLY,
THEY'RE OUT
OF THEIR MEETING,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
AND THEY'LL ADVISE
YOU OF WHERE YOU'RE
GONNA BE STAYING AT.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
ALL RIGHT.
OK.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
THEN THE VIETNAMESE
GARLIC HOT SAUCE--

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
OH, MAN, THAT'S--
WHOO-WEE!

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
THAT'S BOMB.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
MAKE ANYTHING
TASTE GOOD.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
LET ME SEE THAT.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
HA HA HA!

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
HARBOR LIGHTS.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
YOU BEEN THERE BEFORE?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
MM. THEY REFERRED ME
OVER THERE ONE TIME,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
AND I WENT
OVER THERE AND--

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
AND DIDN'T STAY.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
HARBOR LIGHTS?
THE SHELTER?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
MM-HMM.
NO.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
WHY YOU CAN'T MAKE
THE DECISION?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
FOR HIM TO STAY THERE?
YEAH.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
IS IT OK?
THAT'S WHAT I'M
ASKING YOU RIGHT NOW.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
YEAH, IT'S OK.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
YOU GOT ROOM?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
PEOPLE ARE SAYING
THAT IT'S NOT OK.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
HE HAS DRAWER SPACE.
THE ONLY THING WE
GOT TO WORK ON

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
IS CLOSET SPACE.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
WHAT PEOPLE?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
JUST--WE'LL WORK
THIS OUT.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
WE'LL REALLY
WORK THIS OUT.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
NO. SERIOUSLY,
YOU'RE OK WITH THAT

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT YOU--

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
WE'LL WORK THIS OUT
BECAUSE HARBOR LIGHTS--

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
WHEN YOU GOT SOMEWHERE
TO STAY, WHY STAY
IN A SHELTER?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
YEAH. BECAUSE I'M--
I'M GONNA BE--

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
I ALREADY KNOW
THE SITUATION
WITH THAT, SO...

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
WHERE THE KIDS AT?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
MR. DUDERS?

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
HEH HEH.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
HEY, BUDDY!

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
HA HA HA!

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
WHAT'S UP?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Hayes, voice-over:
A LOT OF TIMES WHEN
I BEEN GETTING OUT,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING,
I MIGHT BE AT THE HOUSE

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
LONG ENOUGH
TO DROP OFF MY BOX,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
MY BAGS, WHATEVER,
AND THEN I'M OUT THE DOOR

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
AND BEATING THE STREET.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
I THINK THAT BY GOING HOME

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
AND SPENDING TIME
WITH THE FAMILY,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
ESPECIALLY IN
THE RELATIONSHIP SITUATION

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
WHICH I'M KIND OF FACING,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
THERE'S A LOT OF FEARS,
TRUST ISSUES,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
STUFF LIKE THAT.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
SO IT'S GOOD TO SPEND TIME
AND TALK OVER

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
SOME OF THE ISSUES
THAT ARE AT HAND,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
KIND OF EASE THE MIND,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
THAT FOR THE MUSIC?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Roberts: IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, MAN.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.
HOW'S LIFE, MAN?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
MAN, YOU KNOW, JUST
GOING TO THESE
JOB INTERVIEWS

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
AND, YOU KNOW,
GETTING SHOT DOWN,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
YOU KNOW WHAT
I MEAN?

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
I GOT A GOOD LITTLE
LEAD HERE FOR A JOB

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
THAT I THINK YOU MIGHT
APPRECIATE.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
KIND OF A PRETTY GOOD
SETUP HERE.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
IT'S LONG-TERM,
GOT BENEFITS
AND THE WHOLE SHOT.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
OK.
YOUR OFFENSE
IS GONNA PROBABLY

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
MAKE HIM LOOK AT YOU
CROSS-EYED FOR SECOND.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
THEN HE GONNA COME BACK
TO--YOU KNOW, THEN--

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
THEN YOU SAY,
"HERE'S MY P.O.'s"--

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
ONE OF MY CARDS

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
AND GIVE IT TO HIM.
OK.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
YOUR OFFENSE MAKES HIM
LOOK AT--

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
THAT'S AUTOMATIC.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
YOU'VE PROBABLY BEEN
GETTING THAT
ALL ALONG ANYWAY.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
OH, MAN.
AS SOON AS I GET
IN THE INTERVIEW,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
THEY'RE "OK.
WHAT WERE YOU
CONVICTED OF?"

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
"UH, I WAS CONVICTED
OF A HOMICIDE, SIR."

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
AND THEIR EYES GO
RNN RNN RNN RNN!

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
THEY SIT BACK...

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
HA HA HA!

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
TAKE A REAL GOOD
LOOK AT ME.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
IT'S TOUGH FOR PEOPLE
TO COMPREHEND THAT
SOMETIMES.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
AND THEN THEY'RE
LIKE, "OK. WELL,
WE'LL CALL YOU."

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
I SAY, "OK."
THEN I GIVE THEM

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
MY GOING-OUT-THE-DOOR
SPEECH, YOU KNOW,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
"BELIEVE ME.
IF YOU GIVE ME
THE JOB,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
"I'LL BE A DEPENDABLE
INDIVIDUAL FOR YOU

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
"AND GIVE YOU
A HARD'S DAY WORK--

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
A HARD DAY'S WORK."

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
YEAH, YEAH.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
AND THEN THEY
TELL ME "OK.
WE'LL CALL YOU."

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
HA HA HA!

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
AND THAT PHONE
NEVER--THAT PHONE

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
NEVER RINGS
ON THAT JOB.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
I WAS LIKE, "AWW."

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
SOON AS I LEAVE HERE,
I'M GONNA GO OUT THERE

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
AND GO GET
THE APPLICATION,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
PUT THE APPLICATION
IN AND, UH--

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
AND JUST BE UP FRONT
WITH HIM

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
BECAUSE HE WORKS
WITH SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE
IN THE OFFICE HERE.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
HE'S A REAL GOOD GUY,
SO JUST BE UP FRONT
WITH HIM.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
MOST DEFINITELY.
I WILL.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
YEAH.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Scott: SIMON WAS
JUST TEMPORARY.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
WHO'S NEXT?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
West: I'LL GO.
MY NAME IS RANDY WEST.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
I'M TIRED. I JUST GOT
A JOB THIS MORNING.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
I START TOMORROW
AT 6 A.M.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
THANK YOU.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
I WENT YESTERDAY
ON A JOB LEAD,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
WENT IN, FILLED OUT
MY APPLICATION.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
THE GUY GAVE ME
A PREINTERVIEW

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
RIGHT THERE ON THE SPOT.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
I TOLD HIM THAT I
DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT THIS JOB,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
BUT I'M WILLING TO LEARN,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
AND, YOU KNOW, SO HE SAYS,
"WELL, IF YOU'RE
WILLING TO LEARN,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
"WE'RE WILLING
TO TEACH YOU

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
HOW TO HANDLE THE JOB,"

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
AND SO, YOU KNOW,
SO THEY GAVE ME
AN OPPORTUNITY.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Man: DID YOUR HISTORY
EVER COME UP?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
WELL, MY HISTORY CAME UP.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
HE ASKED ME HOW MUCH
TIME I DID,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
AND I TOLD HIM I DID
16 YEARS.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
I TOLD HIM I WAS
IN JAIL FOR HOMICIDE,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
I WAS JUST UP FRONT
ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
HERE IT IS.
THIS IS WHO I AM.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
THIS IS WHO YOU
WILL BE EMPLOYING.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
YOU KNOW, I'M REAL GLAD
THAT I'M BACK UP
AND WORKING.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
YOU KNOW, ONE THING
I LIKE TO DO IS
I LIKE TO WORK,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
AND I'VE BEEN DOWN
FOR A MINUTE,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
SO, YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
I'M READY, I'M RARING
AND READY TO GO.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
HAVE TO COME TODAY

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
BECAUSE NOW I'M EMPLOYED,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
BUT I WANTED TO COME IN
AND SHARE THAT

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
YOU KNOW,
WITH EVERYBODY HERE

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
BECAUSE WHEN I
WASN'T EMPLOYED,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
EVERYBODY ELSE WAS HERE
SHARING, SO...

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Man: I'VE WORKED
IN THE GANG UNIT

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
FOR THE LAST 3 1/2, 4 YEARS,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
SO I'VE DEALT
WITH GANG MEMBERS
DURING THAT TIME.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
CASE LOAD THAT I HAD BEFORE,
IT WAS LIKE CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I WASN'T USED TO GUYS--
YOU KNOW, NOW I GOT
GUYS CALLING UP,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
SAYING, "HEY, I NEED TO COME
AND TALK TO YOU,"

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
AND THEY COME IN,
AND THEY PUT IT ALL
ON THE TABLE, YOU KNOW,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
AND THAT'S REFRESHING.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Harper, voice-over:
I WAS JOB SEARCHING.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
I WENT INTO
ONE BUSINESS,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
ASKED ABOUT A--
I TOLD HIM I HAD
FILLED OUT

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
AN APPLICATION.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
THEY SAID THEY
WASN'T HIRING,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
SO THEN I WENT
ACROSS THE STREET.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
THE NEXT THING
I KNOW, TWO PEOPLE
WAS FOLLOWING ME,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
YOU KNOW,
AND I LOOKED,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
AND I SAID,
"I DON'T KNOW
WHAT FOR,"

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
SO I JUST KEPT ON
KNOCKING ON DOORS.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
THE NEXT THING
I KNOW, HERE COME
THE POLICE.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
THEN ONE THING LED
TO ANOTHER.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
I TOLD HIM THAT
I WAS ON PAROLE,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
AND I GAVE HIM
TRAVIS' NAME,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
AND THE FIRST THING
HE ASKED ME,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
"WELL, WHEN
THE LAST TIME
YOU SEEN HIM?"

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
I SAID, "TWO DAYS
AGO," YOU KNOW,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
AND IT WAS KIND OF
LIKE A SHOCK.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
YOU KNOW, I SAID,
"WELL, I BE IN TOUCH
WITH HIM ALL THE TIME."

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
YOU KNOW, I KNOW
A LOT OF PEOPLE--

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
YOU KNOW, I USED
TO GET IN.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
YOU KNOW, I USED TO
CHECK IN AND...
YOU KNOW.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
THEN WHEN HE CAME BACK,
HE HAD, LIKE, A KIND
OF FROWN ON HIS FACE,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
AND I SAID, "WELL,
I KNOW YOU TALKED
TO TRAVIS, RIGHT?"

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
HE SAID, "YEAH."

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
I SAID, "WELL, WHAT
YOU GONNA DO?"

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
HE SAID, "WELL, I'M
GONNA TAKE YOU BACK

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
AND LET YOU GO."

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
COME ON IN.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Scott: ONE REASON
WHY YOU'RE BEING--

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
YOU'RE IN VIOLATION
OF YOUR SUPERVISION

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
IS BECAUSE YOU LEFT
TREATMENT,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
AND WHEN WE TALKED,
YOU TALKED ABOUT
HAVING A BEER,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
SO YOU RELAPSED
PRETTY MUCH.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
I HAD THE BEER
THE DAY AFTER
I LEFT TREATMENT.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
OK. DOES THAT
MAKE A DIFFERENCE
IF IT'S A DAY AFTER?

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
I'M JUST TELLING YOU
WHAT HAPPENED,
THAT'S ALL.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
OK. BUT WHERE DO
YOU THINK THAT WE
NEED TO GO FROM HERE?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S--

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
THE LAST 16 YEARS
OF MY LIFE HAVE JUST
BEEN A MESS BASICALLY.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT
THE BLACK AND WHITE
YOURSELF,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
SO YOU KNOW THAT,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
AND, UH, IT'S BEEN
LIKE IT'S BEEN

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
ON A HOLDING PATTERN,
YOU KNOW?

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
AND I'M JUST TIRED OF--

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
I'M JUST TIRED
OF MY LIFE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
THE LAST FEW, UH...

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S LIKE TREATMENT
FOR ME HAS BEEN

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
MORE TRAUMATIC
THAN THERAPEUTIC
TO BE QUITE HONEST.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
I'M JUST TIRED OF THIS.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
I'M JUST TIRED
OF BEING LOCKED UP.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
I AM TIRED...

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
OF NOT DOING SOMETHING
WITH MY LIFE.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
I DIDN'T EXPECT
THIS TO HAPPEN.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M CRYING ON CAMERA.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
UM...

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
AS FAR AS EVER USING
AGAIN, IT AIN'T
GONNA HAPPEN

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
BECAUSE, FROM WHAT
I'VE SEEN, IT'S JUST
A DEAD END STREET,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
AND IT'S NOT THE WAY
I WAS RAISED,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
SO I DON'T WANT
TO BE OUT THERE,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
YOU KNOW, WASTING
MY LIFE BEHIND A BAG
OR A BOTTLE.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE,
BUT ... THAT ...

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
WHAT DOES IT TAKE
FOR YOU TO GET
WHAT YOU NEED

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
IN ORDER FOR YOU
TO SUCCEED?

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
WHAT'S THAT?

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
I GOT TO THINKING
ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
THESE ARE JUST
A FEW IDEAS.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT OUT-PATIENT
TREATMENT

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
IS GOOD FOR YOU?

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
I ACTUALLY NEED
TO BE DOING SOMETHING
WITH MY LIFE.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
I'M TIRED OF MY LIFE--
IT'S JUST BEEN
ON A REALLY SCREWED UP,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
GO-NOWHERE PATTERN
FOR THE PAST 16
FREAKING YEARS.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
YOU KNOW, BEFORE I CAME
A DRUG ADDICT,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
I WORKED
AT U.S. NATIONAL BANK,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
I WAS GOING TO COLLEGE,
MAJORING IN TELEVISION
AND VIDEO PRODUCTION.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
I ACTUALLY HAD
A LOT GOING ON
FOR MYSELF.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
YOU'RE NOT DOING
THAT.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
EXACTLY.
THAT'S MY POINT.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
I'M NOT DOING
THAT RIGHT NOW, AND--

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
I GOT ANOTHER
QUESTION FOR YOU.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
THE REASON WHY YOU
LEFT TREATMENT

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
WAS TO LIVE
WITH THIS GIRL

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
BECAUSE YOU MET
THIS GIRL,
ISN'T THAT CORRECT?

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
I WASN'T PLANNING
ON LIVING WITH HER.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
I DIDN'T GO STRAIGHT
TO HER HOUSE.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
I WASN'T--I DIDN'T
LEAVE TREATMENT

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
JUST TO GO LIVE
WITH HER, NO.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
NO, I DIDN'T.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
I CALLED HER SUNDAY,
AND SHE SAID,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
"WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME OVER?"

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
"OK. YEAH. I WOULD."

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
AND THEN I CALLED YOU
MONDAY AND LET YOU KNOW
WHERE I WAS AT.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
I DIDN'T LEAVE TREATMENT
TO GO BE WITH HER.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
NO, I DIDN'T.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT YOU DIDN'T
LOSE FOCUS

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
OFF YOUR TREATMENT
AND START FOCUSING
ON THIS WOMAN...

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
MORE THAN MY TREATMENT?
NO.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
YEAH. AND LEFT
TREATMENT.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
SHE'S NOT GONNA
KEEP ME CLEAN.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
THAT'S REALLY--
NO, SHE ISN'T.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
NO. THAT'S ONLY OBVIOUS.
THAT'S ONLY COMMON SENSE.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
SHE IS NOT GONNA
KEEP ME--

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
YEAH, I LOVE HER.
I LOVE HER TO DEATH,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
AND I PLAN ON GETTING
MARRIED TO HER, OK,
BUT ANOTHER HUMAN--

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
YOU MET HER WHAT,
TWO MONTHS AGO?

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
YEAH.
OK.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
ANOTHER HUMAN BEING
IS NOT GONNA HELP ME
STAY CLEAN.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
ONLY I CAN DO THAT
FOR MYSELF.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
OK. THAT'S
THE REASON WHY
I'M RECOMMENDING

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
THAT YOU GO BACK
TO IN-PATIENT
TREATMENT

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
BECAUSE WHAT I KNOW
IS THAT YOUR
BEST THINKING

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
GOT YOU WHERE
YOU'RE AT TODAY.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO MY COUNSELOR
THERE--KELLY?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
TELL ME WHAT YOU
WERE GOING THROUGH.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH
WERE OTHER CLIENTS

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
WERE DELIBERATELY TRYING
TO SABOTAGE MY PROGRAM,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
TRY TO MAKE THINGS
HARDER ON ME DELIBERATELY.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
ASK HER.
SHE WILL TELL YOU.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
THEY MADE ME
SECURITY MANAGER
OF THE PLACE,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
AND AS SOON AS THEY DID,
I BECAME A TARGET.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
AND IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU HAVE THIS

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
ONGOING KIND
OF THING

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
THAT PEOPLE ARE
TRYING TO
SABOTAGE YOU.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT
BECAUSE I USUALLY
KEEP TO MYSELF.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
I MIND MY OWN BUSINESS,
DO MY OWN TIME,
AND KEEP TO MYSELF.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
RIGHT, BUT ISN'T
THAT TRUE?

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
ISN'T THAT THE WAY
THAT YOU FEEL,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
THAT PEOPLE
ARE TRYING TO
SABOTAGE YOU.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
IT'S NOT PARANOIA.
IT'S NOT PARANOIA.
IT'S JUST--

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
DID I BRING THAT UP?

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
I'M JUST PUTTING
IT OUT THERE.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
IT'S NOT.
THAT WOULD BE
THE NEXT ASSUMPTION

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
I'D IMAGINE.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
YOU SAY THAT YOU'VE
BEEN IN TROUBLE
ALL THIS TIME.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
YOU'VE BEEN
IN TROUBLE
FOR 16 YEARS.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
"MY LIFE'S BEEN
TERRIBLE
FOR 16 YEARS,"

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
AND IT'S BEEN
CHAOTIC AND TERRIBLE

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:05.000
BECAUSE
OF THE CHOICES

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
THAT YOU'VE MADE
IN LIFE.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
SO WHAT I'M DOING
IS THAT I'M SAYING

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
THAT I HAVE MADE
A DECISION

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
THAT I'M GOING TO
IMPOSE A SANCTION

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
OF SOME ODD AMOUNT
OF DAYS IN JAIL

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
AND THAT YOU'RE
GONNA GO BACK TO
IN-PATIENT TREATMENT.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Scott, voice-over: HE APPEARS
VERY INTELLIGENT,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
BUT HE MAKES VERY POOR CHOICES.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
I THINK HE NEEDS
A MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
I THINK THERE'S SOME PARANOIA
GOING ON THERE

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
THAT HE'S NOT AWARE OF.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
I THINK THAT HE'S AWARE
THAT WE THINK THAT THERE'S

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
SOME PARANOIA GOING ON,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
SO HE WAS REALLY
ADAMANT ABOUT THAT.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000
WHAT I BELIEVE IS THAT
HE MAY NOT STAY IN TREATMENT,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
AND I THINK THAT HE'S
UNAWARE OF THE FACT

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
THAT THE WOMAN THAT HE
MET HAS DEFOCUSED HIM

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
OFF OF HIS RECOVERY,
OUT OF TREATMENT,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
AND BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
I MEAN, YOU NEVER CAN TELL
WHAT THE SUCCESS RATE IS

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
BECAUSE THAT LIGHT
MAY TURN ON ANY MINUTE.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
IT COULD BE TURNING ON
RIGHT NOW,

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
HE COULD BE SITTING
IN HIS CELL RIGHT NOW,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
THINKING, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
MARQUITA WAS RIGHT

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
"ABOUT THE FACT THAT
THAT WOMAN DERAILED ME

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
FROM MY OWN TREATMENT PROGRAM."

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
YOU JUST HAVE TO
KEEP TRYING, YOU KNOW.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
AS LONG AS THEY'RE BREATHING,
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
FOR THEM TO STAY
CLEAN AND SOBER.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
JUST AS LONG
AS THEY'RE BREATHING.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Camellia: HELLO?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
HEY, CAMELLIA.
UH-HUH.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM HIM YET?

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
NO. I SURE HAVEN'T.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
OK. HEY. DID YOU GUYS
HAVE ANY CONFLICT
THIS WEEKEND?

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
YEAH, WE DID.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
OK. I WAS KIND OF
SUSPECTING THAT

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
WHEN I TALKED
TO YOU EARLIER.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
I DON'T KNOW.
JUST A LITTLE

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
LOVERS' QUARREL,
I GUESS.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
LOVERS' QUARREL?
YEAH.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
NO PHYSICAL CONTACT?
NO HITTING?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
OH, NO.
NO PHYSICAL CONTACT
AT ALL.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
JUST KIND OF NEED
SOME FINANCIAL HELP,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
AND HE CAN ONLY
DO SO MUCH NOW,
YOU KNOW?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
OK. SO WHAT'S UP
WITH THE DRUG USE STUFF?

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
UM, HE TOLD ME
HE SMOKED SOME WEED
THAT MORNING,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
BUT I KNOW HE'S
DOING MORE.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
I BELIEVE HE IS,
TOO.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
ARE YOU USING?
NO.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
YOU HAVEN'T USED
AT ALL WITH HIM?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
UH-UH.
I SURE HAVEN'T.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
IF HE CALLS,
I'LL LET HIM KNOW

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
THAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET AHOLD
TO HIM AND STUFF.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
WELL, WHAT YOU
CAN LET HIM KNOW

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
IS THAT IF I DON'T
SEE HIM IN THE NEXT
COUPLE OF DAYS,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
HE'S GOING TO JAIL.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
THAT'S WHAT YOU
CAN LET HIM KNOW.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
I'M GONNA TRY TO GET
HIM SOME HELP FIRST,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
BUT IF HE DOESN'T
RESPOND TO IT,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
THEN THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.
WE'RE GONNA...

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
HAVE TO GO
TO ANOTHER LEVEL.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
YEAH. TAKE IT
TO ANOTHER LEVEL.
ABSOLUTELY.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
I KNOW HE'S THERE.
I KNOW HE'S THERE.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
ALL RIGHT.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
YOU HEAR SOMEBODY?

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
SOMEBODY SAID,
"CAN I HELP YOU?"

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
HEY. YOUR MOM HERE?
CAMELLIA?

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
CAMELLIA HERE?
HUH?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
CAMELLIA AND ARTHUR,
ARTHUR HAYES.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
NOTHING.
I'M ARTHUR'S P.O.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
ARTHUR'S NOT HERE.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Camellia: YEAH.
HE'S NOT HERE.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
HEY, GIRL.
HOW YOU DOING?

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
I COULDN'T FIND HIM
DOWNTOWN ON THE BRICKS,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
SO I FIGURED YOU
WAS COMING.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
I HAVE TO DO
A HOME VISIT

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
BEFORE I PUT
A WARRANT OUT
FOR HIM ANYWAY.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
HEY, LADY.
YOU BETTER GET
THAT IN THERE.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
I'M COVERING
MY MOUTH.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
IS SHE YOUR MOM?
HOW YOU DOING,
MA'AM?

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
IT'S GOOD
TO MEET YOU.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
THAT'S
TRAVIS CAMPBELL.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
NANNY, DID YOU
GIVE ME THIS OUTFIT?

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
HEY, MAN. HEY.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Camellia: HE'S BEEN
DOWNTOWN ON THE BRICKS
AND ALL THAT.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
WELL, ONCE WE GET
HIM STRAIGHT,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
HE GONNA GO TO--
WE HAVE TO GET HIM

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
IN TREATMENT
AND STUFF.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
SO ONCE HE'S
STRAIGHT,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
IS HE WELCOME
TO COME BACK?

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
YEAH.
OK. JUST
MAKING SURE.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
GOOD NIGHT ALL.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
JUST STAY
IN CONTACT.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
ALL RIGHT. I WILL.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000
SO NOW WE JUST PUT OUT
THE WARRANT FOR HIM.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
IF WE DON'T FIND
HIM TONIGHT--

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
PUT WARRANT OUT--
HE'S GONNA HAVE
A WARRANT MONDAY,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
SO I'LL PUT IT
OUT FOR HIM.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
THEN WE CAN ALSO--
ONCE WE GET
OUR STUFF

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
CAUGHT UP
WITH THE OFFICE
AND STUFF,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
WE CAN PROBABLY
GET BACK OUT HERE

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
AND GET OUT
DOWNTOWN.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
YEAH.
AND KIND OF LOOK
FOR HIM THEN, TOO,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
BUT THAT'S WHAT'S
UP WITH ARTHUR.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
TOO BAD, MAN.
YEAH.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Roberts: WHAT'S UP, MAN?
TURNED YOURSELF IN, HUH?

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
YEAH.
HOW YOU DO THAT?

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
THINGS DIDN'T GO
THE WAY THAT

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
I HAD PLANNED
FOR THEM TO GO,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
WHICH I
SEMI-CALCULATED,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS GONNA BE
THIS BAD,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING?

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
MY HOUSING SITUATION
JUST REALLY JUST

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
PUT A DAMPER
IN THE WHOLE
PROGRAM.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
HAVING TO LIVE
WITH YOUR GIRL, RIGHT?

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
THAT WAS
A BAD SITUATION,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
AND YOU WAS THROWING
WARNING SIGNS UP
ALL DAY LONG,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING--
WHAT HAPPENED
AS FAR AS I KNOW

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
IS THAT WITH
THE HOUSING SITUATION

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
COUNTY'S GOING THROUGH TIMES
OF BUDGET CRISIS BASICALLY,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
AND I TRIED TO
EXPRESS THAT.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
I KNOW IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHEN YOU'RE

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
IN NEED AT THAT
POINT IN TIME,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
BUT WE'VE HAD TO TURN
AWAY MANY PEOPLE
BECAUSE OF THAT,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
SO THE TRANSITIONAL
HOUSING THING IS
REALLY TOUGH RIGHT NOW.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
I GOT TO REFLECT
ON EVERYTHING SINCE
I'VE BEEN OUT

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
AND GET MY HEAD
BACK TO WHERE, OK,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
THINGS IS NOT GONNA
ALWAYS BE LIKE
I WANT THEM--

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
IF I PLAN,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
"THIS HOUSING
GONNA JUMP OFF,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,"

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
IT'S NOT ALWAYS
GONNA BE THAT WAY,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
SO BE PREPARED
FOR, YOU KNOW,
WHATEVER.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
AND HONESTLY,
WHERE ARE YOU AT
WITH YOUR ADDICTION?

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
YOU READY TO STOP,
YOU READY TO ARREST
THAT WHOLE THING?

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
YEAH.
OK.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
I MEAN, I KNOW
YOU ALWAYS DO
THAT. "YEAH. "

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
I MEAN, I'M SAYING--
YOU KNOW,

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
I FEEL LIKE,
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
DRUGS ISN'T
THE ISSUE.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
OK. OK. WHAT'S
THE ISSUE?

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
SO WHAT'S
THE ISSUE?

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
THE ISSUE IS
HOUSING, HOUSING.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
HERE'S A GOOD OPTION
RIGHT NOW IS THE--

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
AFTER YOU GET DONE
WITH THE TREATMENT PROGRAM,

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
IF YOU CAN DISCIPLINE
YOURSELF ENOUGH
TO STAY THERE TO FINISH,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
WHAT THEY DO IS
WHEN YOU GET
INTO PHASE 3,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
BOTH PLACES,
THEY'LL WORK WITH YOU

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
TO HAVE ACCESS
TO REALLY GOOD HOUSING,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
SO WE'LL JUST--
YOU KNOW, WE'LL
WORK FROM--

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
WE'LL WORK THIS OUT
RIGHT NOW.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
I'M CLEAR?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
I FEEL LIKE
I'M REALLY CLEAR.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
YOU'RE CLEAR,
AND I'M CLEAR

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000
ON WHERE YOU NEED TO BE,
WHAT YOU WANT

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
BECAUSE MOST FOLKS
THAT ARE OUT THERE

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
DON'T TURN
THEMSELVES IN.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
WE GOT TO GO FIND THEM,
CATCH THEM,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
PUT A WARRANT OUT,
WHATEVER.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
SO YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING
THIS TIME,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
BUT I FOR SURE AM
GONNA GET YOU SET UP
WITH SOMETHING, FOR SURE.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
WHATEVER WE GOT,
I'M GONNA GET IT FOR YOU.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
I'M GONNA TRY
TO GET IT TO YOU.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
West: YOU GET UP AND SAY,
"OK. I'M GONNA HAVE ME--

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
"OK. I'M GONNA HAVE ME
TWO PIECES OF BACON,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
ONE EGG,
AND TWO PANCAKES."

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
2 PANCAKES TURN
INTO 6, 3 EGGS,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
AND 5 PIECES OF BACON
AND SOME SAUSAGE

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
AND A BIG OLD GLASS
OF ORANGE JUICE,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
AND THEN YOU TURN AROUND
AND YOU LOOK UP,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
YOU GOING THROUGH
THE DRIVE-THROUGH
AT EITHER McDONALD'S,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
BURGER KING, TACO BELL.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
OH, MAN.
HA HA HA!

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
NEXT TIME YOU
TURN AROUND,
YOU LOOKING.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
YOUR PANTS ARE
TOO TIGHT.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
HA HA HA!

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
YOUR PANTS ARE
TOO TIGHT.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
YOU WONDERING, LIKE,
"HOW DID I GET
LIKE THIS?"

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
IT KILLS YOU, MAN.
THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT IS FUNNY.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:37.000
TODAY'S OUR DAILY ROUTINE
WHERE WE COME ON DOWN HERE
TO THE PARK AND GET IT IN.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
WHICH FOOT?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
OHH!

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
I HAD HIM ON THAT.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
West, voice-over:
YOU KNOW, I HAD ONE JOB
THAT I REALLY LIKED,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
AND I HAD THE JOB
FOR ABOUT A WEEK.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
YOU KNOW, THEY TRIED
TO GIVE ME THE EXCUSE

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
THAT I WASN'T WORKING
HARD ENOUGH FOR FAST ENOUGH,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
AND I WAS TELLING THEM
"WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M
JUST NOW LEARNING THE JOB."

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
COME TO FIND OUT,
THE OTHER GUY THAT
WAS TRAINING ME,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
THEY FIRED HIM, TOO.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
IT'S BECAUSE HE WAS
LACKING ON THE JOB,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
AND SO I GOT FIRED
BECAUSE HE WAS LACKING
ON THE JOB,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
AND BEING THAT HE
WAS TRAINING ME

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
MADE IT LOOK LIKE THAT I
WAS LACKING ON THE JOB, TOO.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
MY PAROLE OFFICER NATE ROBERTS,
HE HAD TALKED TO THEM,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
AND THEY HAD KIND OF CONVEYED
THAT MESSAGE TO HIM,

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
BUT THEY NEVER CALLED ME.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
IT AIN'T NO PROBLEM.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
THAT'S HOW LIFE IS.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
LIFE AIN'T FAIR.
IT'S NEVER FAIR.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
HE BEEN GONE SINCE--
HOW OLD WAS I
WHEN YOU LEFT?

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
ABOUT 2 1/2.
2 1/2, 3.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
ME AND MY GRANDMAS,
MY MOM, HIS BROTHER,
MY UNCLE,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
WE WENT AROUND--
WE WENT DOWN
TO SALEM

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
ABOUT EVERY--
WE TRIED TO GO
AT LEAST

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
EVERY OTHER WEEKEND,
LET HIM KNOW THAT

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
THE LOVE WAS
STILL THERE.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
ME AND MY GIRL,
WE'RE FIXING TO HAVE--

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
WE'RE FIXING
TO HAVE A KID.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
GOT ONE ON THE WAY,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
SO, YOU KNOW, I'M LOOKING
REAL FORWARD TO THAT.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA
MAKE SURE THIS TIME AROUND

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
I'M GONNA BE THERE
FOR THE DURATION.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Roberts: ARE YOU
PRETTY NERVOUS?

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
AM I NERVOUS?
YEAH.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
ABOUT GETTING
MARRIED?

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
COME ON, MAN.
YOU EVER BEEN
MARRIED BEFORE?

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
YEAH, I BEEN
MARRIED BEFORE.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
THAT'S WHY I'M NERVOUS.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
WELL, THE LADY I'M
ENGAGED TO,

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
SHE HAD A FEW
MEDICAL CONCERNS
THIS WEEKEND,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000
AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT
AND DECIDED MAYBE SHE
SHOULD COME

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
TO THE DOCTOR TODAY
AND GET IT CHECKED OUT.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
YOU KNOW, IT'S--
WITH CHILDREN ON THE WAY,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
I'M NOT TAKING
NO CHANCES.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
CHILDREN?
YOU SAID CHILDREN.
SO YOU'RE HAVING--

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
TWINS.
OK. TWINS
ON THE WAY.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000
PLURAL. YEAH.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL,
MAN.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
YEAH. I WASN'T
EXPECTING ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
I'M STILL
KIND OF STUNNED.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
FIRST KIDS?

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
NO. I HAVE--
I HAVE A PREVIOUS SON

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
FROM A RELATIONSHIP
I WAS INVOLVED IN
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
HOW OLD IS HE?
HE'S 14.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
14 YEARS OLD. OK.
DO YOU SEE HIM?

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
DO YOU EVER SEE HIM?

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
I'VE CALLED HIM.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
I'M GONNA TRY TO GIVE
HIM A CALL AGAIN
THIS WEEK.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000
OH, GOOD.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
HOLDING OFF

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
UNTIL I WAS STABLE
ENOUGH IN MY OWN LIFE

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
TO MAKE A CONTACT
WITH HIM.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
WELL, I MEAN,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE
FREE, MAN.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
I'M GLAD YOU'RE
DOING WELL.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
I'M GLAD I'M
FREE, TOO.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
YEAH, YEAH.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
MAKES A REAL
BIG DIFFERENCE.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
I'M IN TREATMENT
RIGHT NOW.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
UM...

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
DON'T REALLY LIKE IT
TOO MUCH.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
IT'S NOT THE PROGRAM ITSELF.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
THERE'S SOME PARTICULAR
ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
I'M HAVING TO DEAL WITH
I REALLY DON'T CARE
TOO MUCH FOR.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
AND MY FATHER.
HE'S GOT TERMINAL CANCER,

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
AND HE'S ONLY GOT,
LIKE, TWO MONTHS TO LIVE,

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
AND THAT'S
RATHER DISAPPOINTING

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
BECAUSE I WAS HOPING
THAT, YOU KNOW,

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
MY FIANCÉE'S AND MY KIDS
WOULD BE BORN

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
BUT IRONICALLY,
IT'S, UH, MAKING ME VALUE

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
MY RECOVERY
A LITTLE BIT STRONGER.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE--
IT'S MAKING ME REALIZE

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
JUST HOW SHORT OUR TIME
ON EARTH REALLY IS.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Harper: I NEED
TO CHECK IN.
I'M DOING OK.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
IT'S BEEN KIND OF ROUGH,
MOVING AND TAKING
CARE OF MY SISTER,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO
TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL
SOON AS I GET BACK

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT
DOING TOO GOOD,
AND SHE HAVE CANCER.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
SHE CAN BARELY
GET AROUND,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000
SO, YOU KNOW, I'VE
BEEN GOING THROUGH A LOT
OF THINGS WITH THAT,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
YOU KNOW,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
I'M NOT IN NO TROUBLE.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
BEEN DOING THE RIGHT THING

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
BECAUSE I'M NOT TRYING
TO GO BACK.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000
I'M TRYING TO STAY
OUT HERE.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT'S
GETTING CLOSE.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
LONGER SHE GONNA LAST,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
YOU KNOW, SO I GOT TO
BE THERE FOR HER.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000
AND SAY, RICHARD, ABOUT--
YOU KNOW, YOU SAY

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
YOUR FATHER'S ABOUT READY
TO PASS AWAY,

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
AND YOUR MOTHER
AND YOUR FATHER BEEN
TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
MY MOTHER AND FATHER WAS
TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
AND MY FATHER
PASSED AWAY--SHOOT--

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
30 YEARS AGO, YOU KNOW,
AND I USED TO THINK

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
MY MOTHER WAS GONNA
HANDLE IT, YOU KNOW,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000
BUT SHE HANDLED IT,
YOU KNOW.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
IT SEEM ROUGH,
BUT SHE'LL GET
THROUGH IT.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
SHE'LL MAKE IT.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000
THANK YOU.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Gamble: GOT TO FIND OUT
WHICH DOOR IT IS.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000
HEY, CALVIN.
HOW YOU DOING?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
IS IT ALL RIGHT
IF WE COME IN?

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
HOW HAVE THINGS
BEEN GOING SINCE
YOUR SISTER PASSED?

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
WELL, IT BEEN
KIND OF ROUGH,

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I'M STILL HANGING
IN THERE.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
I'M KIND OF--
STILL KIND
OF GRIEVING

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
BECAUSE I GOT TO
SOMEHOW GET ALL
THE REST

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
OF THAT STUFF
THAT'S IN THAT ROOM
OUT OF HERE, YOU KNOW.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
I SEE.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
OTHER THAN THAT,
I'VE BEEN DOING OK.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000
YOU KNOW, I WAS
IN SCHOOL,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
BUT THEN MY SISTER
GOT SICK.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
I HAD TO GET OUT
OF SCHOOL

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
SO I COULD TAKE
CARE OF HER,

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000
AND THEN SHE
PASSED AWAY

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
ABOUT TWO MONTHS
AFTER I GOT
OUT OF SCHOOL,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
AND I WAS THINKING
ABOUT GOING BACK
TO SCHOOL,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
BUT I NEED A JOB,
THOUGH.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
LIKE I SAY,
I BEEN PUTTING
IN APPLICATIONS,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
BUT A LOT OF THEM,
THEY'RE SAYING,

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
"WELL"--BECAUSE
I BE TRUTHFUL.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
I LET THEM KNOW
THAT I'M ON PAROLE,

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
AND I ALWAYS
PUT YOUR NAME
AND NUMBER DOWN,

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
SO I SAY, "YOU CAN
CONTACT HIM."

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
A LOT OF THEM SAY,
"WELL, WE'LL
CALL YOU."

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
THEN A LOT OF THEM
SAY, "WE CAN'T
HELP YOU

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
BECAUSE WE CAN'T
HAVE NO FELONIES,"

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING?

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD
BE HELPFUL FOR YOU?

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
RIGHT NOW?
RIGHT NOW.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
UH, THAT PROGRAM
THAT YOU GUYS WAS
TALKING ABOUT,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
THAT TRAINING
PROGRAM.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
SOME TIME
OF JOB TRAINING PROGRAM.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
YEAH. YEAH.
THAT WOULD BE
THE BEST THING

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE, LIKE I SAY,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
I GOT MY MOTHER,
SHE'S HELPING ME
OUT WITH THE RENT

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
AND MY BILLS
AND STUFF RIGHT NOW,

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
AND THEN MY NIECES
AND NEPHEWS,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000
MY SISTER'S KIDS,
BUT LIKE I SAY,

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
I WANT TO BE
INDEPENDENT
ON MY OWN.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
I DON'T WANT HELP.
I WANT TO DO IT
MYSELF.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
HELLO, UM, NATE.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
THIS IS
CAMELLIA McCLENDON.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
IT'S URGENT THAT
YOU GIVE ME A CALL
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
YOU KNOW, ARTHUR
COMES OVER HERE

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
AND VISITS ARVANI,
AND THEM WHEN
HE COMES,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
HE DOESN'T WANT
TO LEAVE.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
THE MAN JUST MESSED
UP MY ELECTRONICS.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
THEN HE THREATENED
TO BUST DOWN
MY WINDOWS.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
YOU NEED TO DO
SOMETHING WITH HIM.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
PUT HIS ... IN JAIL
OR DO SOMETHING.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
HE'S SITTING
UP THERE TRYING
TO BUST OUT

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
PEOPLE'S
HOUSE WINDOWS.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
PLEASE DO SOMETHING
ABOUT ARTHUR HAYES.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Voice mail:
END OF MESSAGE.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
MY NEXT CONTACT WITH HIM,
I KNOW FOR SURE

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
I'M GONNA PUT HIM IN JAIL.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH HER.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
WE TRIED TO WORK
SOME STUFF OUT

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
TO WHERE HE WOULD
GO OVER TO SEE HER--

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
NOT HER BUT SEE HIS SON,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
OR WE CAN FIGURE OUT
SOME OTHER WAY

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
FOR SOMEBODY TO PICK
THE CHILD UP

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
AND GET THE CHILD TO HIM,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
BUT HE, UM, DOESN'T
HAVE ANYWHERE TO STAY,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000
AND WE DON'T WANT TO
TAKE A KID TO A SHELTER.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
"WELL, LET'S GO SEE
YOUR DAD AT THE SHELTER."

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
YOU KNOW, THAT'S KIND
OF FOUL, YOU KNOW,

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
SO I TOLD HIM TO STAY
AWAY FROM HER,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
AND WE'LL WORK
THE BUGS OUT

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
AS FAR AS VISITING
HIS CHILD,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
BUT I MADE A REFERRAL
FOR A PROGRAM

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
WHEN HE WAS
AT 5 MONTHS OUT.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000
HE HAS 5 MONTHS LEFT.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
THIS IS, LIKE, THIS
PAST MONTH,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
AND EVERY PROGRAM
THAT I REFERRED HIM TO

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
SAID, "WE CAN'T TAKE HIM
BECAUSE HE ONLY HAS--

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000
HE HAS LESS THAN 9 MONTHS
ON SUPERVISION LEFT,"

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE
9 MONTHS OR MORE

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
IN ORDER FOR THEM
TO TAKE YOU.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
HE'S CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK
AND A HARD PLACE RIGHT NOW.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
I TALKED TO HIM SPECIFICALLY
ABOUT WHAT IS HE GONNA DO--

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
"WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WHEN YOU'RE OFF PAPER?

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA GO?
HOW ARE YOU GONNA MAKE IT?"

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
SO HE'S LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
I'M TRYING TO GET ALL
THE HELP I CAN GET NOW,"

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
BUT HIS ADDICTION
OVERRIDES EVERYTHING.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
HELLO. HOW YOU DOING?
CAMELLIA HERE?

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Camellia: YEAH.
HE HIT ME,

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.000
BUT I KIND OF DID
SOMETHING, TOO,
THOUGH.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
I WAS CRYING
ON THE WAY
OVER THERE

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
BECAUSE I KNEW
THAT HE WAS TRYING
TO HIT A LICK

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
INSTEAD OF TRYING
TO GET SOMETHING

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
FOR MY SON'S
BIRTHDAY,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
AND IT WAS JUST
A BAD TRIP
THE WHOLE WAY.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
IN SEPTEMBER,
HE HAD ALSO TOOK

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
THE KID'S
SCHOOL CLOTHES,
YOU KNOW.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
IT'S JUST THINGS
LIKE THAT.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
HE EVEN TOOK OFF
IN MY CAR

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
WITH THE KID
IN THE CAR

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
AND TOOK AND SOLD
A BAG OF THE KID'S
SCHOOL CLOTHES.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
YOU KNOW, IT'S--
I KNOW IT'S HARD,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:58.000
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M
A ADDICT, TOO,
BUT I WORK.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU DO.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
IT'S HOW YOU DO IT.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
I MEAN...

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
WELL, TAKING
FROM YOUR FAMILY,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
I JUST CAN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
SO WHAT YOU GONNA DO
WHEN HE'S DONE
WITH EVERYTHING--

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
COURT, PROBATION,
PAROLE--

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO THEN?

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
BECAUSE HE'S GONNA
TRY TO COME OVER
AND SEE YOU,

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
AND WHAT'S
YOUR PLAN?

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
I WANT HIM TO GO
ON HIS MERRY WAY.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
IT'S NOT HEALTHY,
FOR ME,

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000
AND IT'S NOT
HEALTHY FOR HIM

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY
MAKES YOU THAT UPSET
TO EVEN GO THERE,

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
THEN YOU DON'T NEED
TO BE WITH THEM.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
YOU KNOW,
IT'S CRAZY.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Roberts, voice-over:
I'VE HEARD HER TALKING
ABOUT HIM CREEPING

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
OVER TO THE HOUSE
BUT NOT TO THAT EXTENT.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
I KNEW HE WAS
COMING OVER HERE.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
ARTHUR WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO GET IN THERE.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000
WHEN HE ON THAT CRACK,
HE KIND OF--YEAH.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
HE ON THAT CRACK,
HE KIND OF STUPID.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
THAT CRACK COCAINE,
HE GETS OUT HERE

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000
AND HAS NOWHERE ELSE
TO GO,

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
AND THEY USE THAT
"I'M THE BABY DADDY"

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
AS A TOOL, AS A TRICK,
YOU KNOW.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
"LET ME IN.
I WANT TO SEE MY KID."

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
AND IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE KIDS.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
JUST LIKE SHE'S 
SAYING ON HER
SON'S BIRTHDAY,

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
INSTEAD OF THEM
TRYING TO GET
SOMETHING FOR THE SON,

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
HE'S TRYING TO
STEAL STUFF.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
YOU KNOW, HE'S
STILL TRYING TO
FEED HIS ADDICTION.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
HI, LOIS.
THIS IS MARQUITA SCOTT.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000
I'M A P.O.,
AND I'M CALLING

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
IN REFERENCE
TO RICHARD CAMPBELL.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
IS HE STILL EMPLOYED?

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
OK. SO THE LAST TIME
HE CALLED WAS...

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
OK. AND THE LAST DAY
HE WORKED WAS 9/24?

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
OK. WELL, THANK YOU
SO MUCH.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
APPRECIATE YOU.
OK. BYE-BYE.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
HMM.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
SO HE'S NO LONGER WORKING.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
THIS IS A GARAGE
THAT WAS MADE
INTO A--

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
A LIVING QUARTERS.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
THAT'S WHERE RICHARD
DECIDED HE THAT
WANTED TO MOVE TO.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
HEY. HOW YOU DOING?

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000
I'M DOING FINE.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
HI. IS RICHARD
AROUND?

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
NOPE.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SEEN HIM?

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000
WELL, HE CALLED ME--

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000
THE LAST TIME WAS
LAST MONTH.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
LAST MONTH?
YEAH.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
OK. DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHERE
HE MIGHT BE?

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
NO.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
WHEN YOU SAW HIM,
WAS HE HANGING OUT
DOWNTOWN?

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
IS THAT HIS
USUAL HANGOUT?

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
UM, NO. MY FAMILY'S
SEEN HIM DOWNTOWN.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
YOUR FAMILY DID?
YEAH.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
OH, OK. HOW LONG
AGO WAS THAT?

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
THAT WAS LAST MONTH.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000
IT WAS? HOW ARE
YOU DOING?

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000
I'M DOING FINE.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
HOW MANY MONTHS
ARE YOU?

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000
I'M GOING
ON 3 MONTHS.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000
3 MONTHS. SO WHAT
ABOUT RICHARD?

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000
YOU JUST WAITING
TILL HE GETS CLEAN?

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000
YOU WANT HIM BACK?

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
MM-HMM.
YOU DO?

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000
UH-HUH.
OK.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
EVEN THOUGH HE'S
A PAIN IN THE BUTT.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
EVEN THOUGH HE'S
A PAIN, HUH?

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000
HA HA HA!

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
WELL, IF YOU
SEE HIM,
WOULD YOU PLEASE

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000
LET HIM KNOW THAT
I CAME BY.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
I WANT TO SEE HIM
GET CLEAN.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
WELL, I KNOW
WHEN HE CALLS ME.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
I CAN TELL
IF HE'S MESSED UP.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
HE'S BEEN CLEAN
FOR 30 DAYS,
FOR A WHOLE MONTH.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000
HE'S BEEN CLEAN.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
OH. HE HAS?
HOW DO YOU
KNOW THAT?

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000
BECAUSE MY RELATIVES
SAID THAT HE'S NOT--

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
HE'S NOT HANGING OUT
WITH THE DRUGS NO MORE.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
OH, HE'S NOT?

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
AND SO WHEN'S
THE LAST TIME HE
CONTACTED YOU?

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
LAST TIME HE
CONTACTED ME WAS

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
JUST BEFORE
LAST MONTH ENDED.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000
OK.
GREAT.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
HE IS GOING TO
THE AA MEETINGS,

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.000
SO THAT IS
ONE BLESSING.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
THAT IS--THAT'S
A GOOD THING.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
HE NEEDS TO COME IN
AND TELL ME THAT.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
NEXT TIME YOU
TALK TO HIM,

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000
YOU HAVE HIM COME
SEE ME,

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000
YOU HAVE HIM
CALL ME.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000
OK. TAKE CARE.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000
I THINK SHE KNOWS
WHERE HE'S AT.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
I JUST CONTINUED
TO ASK HER QUESTIONS,

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.000
AND THEN SHE CONTINUED
TO GIVE ME JUST A LITTLE
BIT MORE INFORMATION.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
"HE'S STAYING CLEAN."

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
HOW DOES SHE KNOW THAT?

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.000
THROUGH HER SISTER. HMM. OK.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:31.000
JUST...SEEMED AS IF
SHE KNEW MORE THAN
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000
FOR NOT HAVING CONTACT
WITH HIM FOR A MONTH.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:43.000
SO HE'S PROBABLY CONVINCED
HER NOT TO SAY ANYTHING

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000
"OR ELSE I'LL GO TO JAIL,

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:50.000
AND I REALLY WANT TO BE
HERE WITH YOU AND THE BABIES."

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000
YADA, YADA, YADA.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
HEY!
WHAT UP?

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000
COME TALK TO ME.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000
WHO YOU WANT? ME?

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000
BOTH OF YOU.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
HAVE Y'ALL SEEN
RICHARD?

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000
RICHARD?
RICHARD CAMPBELL.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000
LIGHT SKIN.
RICHARD CAMPBELL.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000
NOPE.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000
YOU AIN'T SEE HIM?

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
IF YOU SEE RICHARD...

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000
TELL HIM TO
CALL YOU?

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
TELL HIM TO CALL ME,
AND TELL HIM TO
COME TO GROUP.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
HA HA! OK.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000
YOU GOT TO PUT
THE WORD OUT

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000
BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
THEY'LL GET CLEAN AND SOBER,
AND THEN THEY'LL SAY,

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHEN I WAS OUT THERE,

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
"I SAW THIS GUY,
AND HE TALKED TO ME,

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000
"AND HE TOLD ME,

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
"AND THAT GOT ME
TO THINKING.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
"NOW I REALLY, REALLY
DO NEED TO TURN MYSELF IN,

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
AND THAT'S THE REASON
WHY I'M HERE TODAY."

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
SO YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S
GONNA TURN SOMEBODY'S HEAD

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:44.000
OR, YOU KNOW, MAKE SOMEBODY
DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000
I DON'T THINK THAT
WE'RE GONNA SEE HIM

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:51.000
BECAUSE I THINK THAT HE IS,
UH, AT THE GIRL'S HOUSE.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000
OK. THANKS.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000
HEY.
HOW YOU DOING?

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000
GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000
UH, ALL RIGHT.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
LOOKING DIFFERENT.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
CUT ALL YOUR HAIR
OFF, HUH?

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
YEAH.
OK.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000
WHEN NATE ARRESTED ME,
I WAS ACTUALLY
GLAD TO SEE HIM.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
I TOLD HIM IT WAS
STRESSING ME OUT.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.000
WHAT TOOK YOU
SO LONG, YOU KNOW?

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000
AND I FELT LIKE
I GOT RESCUED
INSTEAD OF ARRESTED.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000
YOU KNOW,
THE RESPONSIBILITY

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
IS YOURS TO REPORT.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000
THE RESPONSIBILITY
IS YOURS TO ADHERE

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000
TO THE CONDITIONS
OF YOUR PAROLE,

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000
AND I--IT'S NOT
OUR JOB TO COME
AND GET YOU

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
OFF THE STREET
AND SAY, "OK.
COME ON.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.000
LET'S GO TO JAIL."

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
WHERE DO YOU GO
FROM HERE?

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000
I DON'T--

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000
UM...

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.000
I'M NOT REALLY SURE.
I MEAN...

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000
PROBABLY I GO
TO IN-PATIENT,
GO TO IN-PATIENT.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
SO WHAT ABOUT
JERUSALEM?

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000
WHO? MY FIANCÉE?

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000
MM-HMM.
AND THE BABIES?

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S--THAT'S--

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THAT, TOO.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW,
I'VE HAD SOME

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000
RELATIONSHIPS
IN THE PAST,

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.000
AND I RAN OUT
ON THOSE, TOO.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000
IT WAS LIKE I DIDN'T
FOLLOW THROUGH
ON THAT EITHER.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000
NOW THAT YOU HAVE
TO GO BACK TO
IN-PATIENT TREATMENT,

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000
WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN FOR YOU?

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000
I CAN COMPLETE
THE PROGRAM.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000
IT'S WHAT I DO
AFTER THAT THAT
MAKES THE DIFFERENCE

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000
FOR ME
IN MY EXPERIENCE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
IN-PATIENT--NOT A PROBLEM.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
I CAN DO IT
AND GRADUATE.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000
AGAIN, THAT'S JUST
NOT THE ISSUE.
IT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000
IT'S WHAT I DO
AFTER I GRADUATE.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
AND WHAT DO YOU NEED
FOR ME TO HELP YOU

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.000
TO BE
SUCCESSFUL NOW?

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000
HMM.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.000
THE SOONER YOU CAN
GET ME IN THAT PROGRAM,
THE BETTER.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
I MEAN, AND THE REST
IS UP TO ME.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.000
WHAT MORE CAN YOU DO?

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000
YOU CAN HELP ME GET
INTO A PROGRAM,

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
BUT THE REST OF IT
IS UP TO ME.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
DID SOME REMODELING
INSIDE, HUH?

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.000
YEAH. YEAH.
THEY'VE BEEN
REMODELING.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Roberts: HE'S WORKING
INDEPENDENTLY

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.000
UNTIL SOMETHING SOLID
COMES UP

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000
WHERE HE CAN GET
A PAYCHECK STUB
AND SHOW--

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000
I MEAN, IF I COME
OVER HERE OR GO
WHEREVER HE'S AT,

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000
HE HAS NO PROBLEM
SHOWING ME WHAT KIND
OF WORK HE'S DOING,

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
LETTING ME KNOW THAT
THE PEOPLE ARE PAYING HIM
TO HAUL THIS STUFF AWAY.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
TO ME, THAT'S CREDIBLE.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000
I MEAN, WHEN YOU TRY
TO MAINTAIN A HOUSEHOLD,

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
YOU TRY TO FEED KIDS,

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000
AND YOU'RE EXPECTING
A KID TO COMING,

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000
YOU GOT TO--SOMETIMES,
YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT
YOU GOT TO DO

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.000
JUST TO MAINTAIN,
JUST TO MAINTAIN IN LIFE--

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000
LIFE IN GENERAL,

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000
OR YOU TURN
TO ILLEGAL MEANS,

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.000
AND THEN ILLEGAL MEANS LEAD
BACK TO THE PENITENTIARY.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000
AND SO I DON'T WANT
NONE OF THAT.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
West, voice-over:
A LOT OF TIMES WHEN
YOU'RE INSIDE,

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.000
YOU'RE SITTING ON YOUR BUNK,
AND YOU'RE THINKING,

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000
LIKE, "MAN, I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET THERE,"

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
"I CAN'T WAIT,"

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.000
BUT THEN WHEN YOU DO GET THERE
AND THE REALITY HIT,

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000
THE DREAM THAT YOU HAVE
MADE IN YOUR MIND,
HOW YOU SEEN IT,

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000
THAT'S A DREAM,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000
IT'S REALLY A DREAM,
AND UNTIL YOU GET OUT,

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000
UNTIL YOU GET--
UNTIL YOU HAVE TO
MAKE THOSE DECISIONS,

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000
UNTIL YOU HAVE TO--UNTIL YOU
HAVE TO GO TO THE GROCERY STORE

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:05.000
AND WATCH $150, $200
GO THROUGH YOUR HANDS,

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000
AND YOU WALK OUT THE STORE,
YOU GOT MAYBE 3 GROCERY BAGS,

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
OH, MAN, YOU BE LIKE,
"OH, MY GOODNESS!

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000
"WHERE DID THE MONEY--
WHERE DID ALL THE MONEY GO

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000
THAT I SAID I WAS GONNA HAVE
WHEN I WAS INSIDE?"

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.000
GROWING UP, IT WAS ALWAYS
ABOUT FAST MONEY, EASY MONEY,

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000
THE FASTEST WAY
I CAN GET IT.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000
I FIND MORE ENJOYMENT
WHEN I SIT DOWN
AND EAT WITH MY FAMILY,

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000
AND I KNOW THAT, "OK.
I GOT OUT AND WORKED
HARD FOR THIS MONEY

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000
SO THAT THEY COULD EAT."

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000
THAT INVOKES A WHOLE
DIFFERENT PRIDE IN YOURSELF

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000
THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
I DIDN'T HAVE TO GO

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000
AND DO SOMETHING ILLEGAL
TO GET IT,

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000
OR I DIDN'T HAVE TO GO
TELL A STEWARD,

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000
"HEY, CAN I GET YOU
TO POP THE FREEZER

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000
"SO WE CAN GET THE MEAT OUT

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000
SO THAT WE CAN COOK
FOR 1,000 PEOPLE?"

00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.000
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000
I FIND ENJOYMENT
GETTING UP

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000
AND GOING TO THE BATHROOM
BY MYSELF,

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
OPENING MY REFRIGERATOR
BY MYSELF,

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000
PICKING AND CHOOSING
WHAT I WANT TO EAT.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000
BATHROOM.
THAT'S FUNNY.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000
I ENJOY THAT,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
BECAUSE THOSE ARE
THE SMALL AMENITIES

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000
THAT'S TOOKEN AWAY
FROM YOU WHEN YOU INSIDE.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.000
ROCK AND ROLL.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.000
ROCK AND ROLL.
THAT'S THE WORK DAY FOR ME.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Roberts: I'M JUST REAL
GLAD TO WORK WITH GUYS
LIKE RANDY STRAIGHT UP.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
IT MAKES ME PROUD
TO BE IN A POSITION

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000
TO SEE A PERSON DO WELL,
TO ASSIST THEM ANYWAY I CAN,

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.000
WHETHER THAT'S A CONVERSATION
OR HELPING WITH JOB SEARCH

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
OR WHATEVER,

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000
BUT MY GOAL IS TO SEE
HIM DO WELL,

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.000
IS TO SEE HIM--
IS TO SUPPORT HIM

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000
IN ANYTHING HE CHOOSES
TO DO,

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000
SO IT'S A GOOD DAY TODAY,
REAL GOOD DAY TODAY.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
Richard: WHEN I WAS
TOLD TODAY THAT YOU GUYS
WERE COMING BY AGAIN,

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
THE FIRST THING
I THOUGHT OF WAS
THE FIRST TIME

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000
THAT WE HAD FILMED,
AND IT WAS THE DAY

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000
I WAS GETTING OUT
OF PRISON,

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000
AND I REMEMBER SOMETHING
MY DAD SAID THAT DAY.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000
HE SAID HE MISSED
MY FRIENDSHIP,

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000
AND, YOU KNOW, HE'S
PASSED AWAY NOW,

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000
AND ACTUALLY MAY HAVE
BEEN THE CATALYST

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000
FOR ME TO FINALLY MAKE
THAT, YOU KNOW,

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.000
ADDITIONAL CHANGE
THAT I NEEDED TO MAKE.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE--
WHEN THEY'RE
IN THEIR ADDICTION

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
OR WHEN THEY'RE
IN THEIR CRIMINALITY,

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000
THEY DON'T REALIZE
THAT LIFE STILL MOVES ON

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
AND THINGS ARE
STILL HAPPENING,

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000
AND THEN THAT'S WHEN
YOU REALIZE, "HEY."

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000
IT'S LIKE YOUR STANDING
AT THE WINDOW NOW.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000
YOU'RE WATCHING LIFE
GO ON,

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:52.000
AND IT'S JUST REAL TOUGH
TO SEE, YOU KNOW, PLACES
WHERE YOU SHOULD BE IN LIFE

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.000
AND NOT HAVING ACCESS
TO THEM BECAUSE
OF CHOICES YOU MADE.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
IF I DO THE BEST
I CAN,

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000
CHANCES ARE THAT
THINGS ARE GONNA
TURN OUT FAIRLY GOOD.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
FAIRLY GOOD.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.000
SO I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO SEEING--

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000
SEEING HOW MY KIDS
ARE GONNA TURN OUT

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000
IF I DO
THE BEST I CAN.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Gamble: CALVIN...

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000
CALVIN HARPER.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000
HE'S BACK IN PRISON,
AND I DON'T--

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000
I STILL DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY HOW MUCH TIME

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.000
THEY'RE GONNA GIVE
HIM ON THOSE
BURGLARY CHARGES.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.000
THE REASON WHY
CALVIN WAS SO TOUGH
TO ME IS BECAUSE

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000
HE WAS DOING
EVERYTHING HE
NEEDED TO DO.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
HE'S SHOWING UP
AT GROUPS,

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000
HE WAS REPORTING
WHEN HE'S
SUPPOSED TO.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
YOU DO A HOME VISIT,
HE'S AT HIS HOUSE,

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
BUT WHAT HE WASN'T
DOING WAS REFRAINING

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
FROM THE CRIMINAL
STUFF.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000
HE WAS GOING OUT
AND APPLYING
FOR JOBS

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
AND STEALING STUFF
WHILE HE WAS THERE

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000
PICKING UP
APPLICATIONS.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000
LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED, MAN.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
YOU HAD A JOB,
AND THINGS KIND OF

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.000
WERE ASSEMBLING OUT
REAL NICE, SO...

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
I KIND OF STARTED
MESSING WITH DRUGS.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
AND THAT WAS SHORTLY
AFTER YOU BECAME EMPLOYED?

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000
ACTUALLY,
IT STARTED--

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
IT REALLY STARTED--
I JUST DIDN'T
SAY IT STARTED--

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
WHEN I LOST
MY SISTER.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
IT STARTED
RIGHT AFTER THAT.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000
SO PRIOR TO YOUR
SISTER'S DEATH,

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
YOU WEREN'T
DOING NOTHING?

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.000
I USED TO SHOOT DOPE
20 YEARS AGO,

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000
AND ONE MORNING,
I WOKE UP,

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
AND I DECIDED
I DIDN'T WANT TO
DO IT NO MORE,

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000
AND I DIDN'T DO IT,

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
AND I HAVEN'T SHOT
DOPE SINCE.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
THESE ARE WAY OLD.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.000
OLD TRACKS. YEAH.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000
THEY AIN'T NOTHING
TO DO--

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.000
YOU KNOW, I LEFT
IT ALONE,

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000
AND I'VE NEVER HAD--
YOU KNOW, I NEVER
HAD TO GO

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000
THROUGH 12-STEP
OR NONE OF THAT.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000
MAYBE I COULD HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO
OPEN UP

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000
AND TALK ABOUT IT.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.000
GRIEF COMES AND GOES,
BUT IT'S A PART
OF OUR LIVES,

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000
SO EVERY TIME
SOMEBODY DIE
YOU GET LOADED?

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO THAT, YOU KNOW.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000
YOU KNOW,
I KIND OF USED
THAT AS AN EXCUSE.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000
THAT WAS
A WONDERFUL EXCUSE,
PERFECT OPPORTUNITY.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000
YEAH, BUT STILL,
THAT'S NOT REALLY--

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
YOU USED BECAUSE YOU
WANTED TO USE.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
IN THE BACK
OF MY MIND,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I PROBABLY ALWAYS
WANTED TO USE,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
AND IT CAME FORWARD
WITH THAT,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
WHICH--BUT NOW ON
I'M NOT GONNA LET
THAT HAPPEN AGAIN.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
ARE YOU ABLE
TO IDENTIFY SOME CHANGE

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
IN YOUR ATTITUDE
FROM THE FIRST TIME
YOU DID TIME,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
GETTING OUT ON PAROLE
TILL TODAY?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
IT'S A LOT OF CHANGE
AS FAR AS

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
ME TRUSTING
A P.O., YES.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
OK. DOES THAT MAKE
A DIFFERENCE, THOUGH,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
BEING ABLE TO TRUST
A P.O.?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
IT MAKES A LOT
OF DIFFERENCE.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
IF I DIDN'T HAVE
YOU GUYS,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
AND IF I'D HAVE HAD
SOMEBODY ELSE--

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
YOU'D BE GONE.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I'D BE GONE,
BUT I STILL--

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I PROBABLY
WOULD STILL BE
IN DENIAL

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
BECAUSE I WOULD
NEVER HAVE OPENED
UP TO THEM PERIOD.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I FEEL BETTER
BECAUSE YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA HELP ME

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
GET THE HELP
THAT I NEED.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
IT MIGHT BE
A LITTLE
PRISON TIME,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
WHICH I UNDERSTAND
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT I DID,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
BUT YOU GUYS IS
GONNA WHEN I GET OUT

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
STILL HELP ME GET
WHAT I NEED

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
BECAUSE I DO
NEED HELP.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000
OK. OK.
THAT'S COOL.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
WELL...

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
SAY HELLO.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
STOP, STOP,
STOP, STOP, STOP.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
SHUT THAT CURTAIN.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
THE DOG IS GOING NUTS.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
GONNA BREAK
THAT GLASS.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
ARE YOU POINTING
THAT AT ME?

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
HEY, BUDDY.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
NO. IT'S THE SOUND.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
WHEN THEY DO,
LIKE, TV SHOWS,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
THEY DO A CAMERA
AND, UM...

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
West: I'M TELLING YOU,
THEY'VE JUST BEEN
HAVING ME RUNNING.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I JUST BE GOING
BACKWARD AND FORWARDS,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
BACK AND FORTH.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
DOCTOR APPOINTMENT HERE.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
OUT HERE TO GET MEDICATION.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
OUT THIS WAY,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
BACK THIS WAY TO
COME GET SOME DOG FOOD.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
BACK THAT WAY TO GO GET
SOME BABY FOOD.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
THEN AT THE SAME TIME,
YOU KNOW,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
TRYING TO BE DOWN,
TRYING TO GET
SOME EMPLOYMENT

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
I GOT DENTAL PLANS,
MEDICAL PLANS,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
AND THINGS LIKE THAT
THAT I NEED TO TRY TO--

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
THAT I NEED TO TRY
TO ESTABLISH

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
BECAUSE THE FAMILY
ARE STARTING TO GROW.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Roberts: HOW HAS
DIFFICULTIT BEEN

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
MAKING THE ADJUSTMENT
DOING ALL THAT TIME,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
THEN BEING OUT ONE YEAR.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.000
THAT'S 16 IN--
16 IN AND ONE OUT.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
WE GET IN THERE
AND GET ON THIS FANTASY

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
THAT WE GONNA COME OUT HERE,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
AND WE GONNA GET
THAT $15 JOB,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
AND WE GONNA BE WORKING.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
THAT $15 JOB JUST DON'T
COME LIKE THAT

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
BECAUSE ONCE YOU GET
ON THAT APPLICATION,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
THEY ASK YOU,
"HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN CONVICTED?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
EXPLAIN."

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
ONCE YOU GET THERE,
ONCE YOU GET TO THAT POINT,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I MEAN, SOMETIMES,
YOU DON'T EVEN MAKE IT--

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
YOU DON'T EVEN MAKE IT
AT THE DOOR.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
IT STARTS WORKING ON YOU.
IT STARTS MAKING YOU
QUESTION YOURSELF,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
LIKE, "MAN, WHAT AM I
DOING WRONG?"

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
I THOUGHT THIS
WAS GONNA BE EASY.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
ALL THE STRENGTH
THAT I HAD

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
WHEN I WAS BACK
THE OTHER WAY.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I HAD THAT.
I WAS HERCULES NOW,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
BUT NOW WHEN
I GET OUT HERE,

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I SEE THAT, MAN,
I'M PEE-WEE HERMAN.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000
NOT ONLY DID HE
HAVE TO DO THAT TIME,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
BUT IT STILL
AFFECTS HIM.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
YOU KNOW, HE PAID
THE CONSEQUENCES,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
AND NOW HE'S STILL
PAYING FOR IT,

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
SO THAT'S ANOTHER THING
ON TOP OF THE--

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
IF YOU THINK YOU
JUST HAVE TO DO
THE TIME AND THAT'S IT,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000
NO, IT'S GONNA AFFECT YOU
FOR LONG BEYOND THAT,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
SO I WISH MORE PEOPLE
WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT
MORE OPEN-MINDED.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
SO WHAT HAVE
TAPPED INTO

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000
TO KEEP YOU
FROM FALLING VICTIM
TO THOSE MISTAKES,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
POOR DECISIONS?

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
WELL, WHAT I TAPPED INTO--

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
THAT I DONE TAPPED INTO

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
IS MY FAMILY
BECAUSE I KNOW

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
THEY GET ENJOYMENT
WHEN THEY SEE ME
EVERY DAY

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
BECAUSE NOW THEY DON'T
HAVE TO SEE ME ON THE WEEKEND.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
THEY DON'T HAVE TO MAKE
THE 45-MINUTE TRIP
TO COME SEE ME

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
IN A DEPRESSING SITUATION
WHERE THEY GET DEPRESSED
TO EVEN COME IN THERE.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
THEY CAME TO ME
WHEN I WAS UNABLE
TO COME TO THEM,

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
SO NOW THAT I'M ABLE
TO COME TO THEM,
THEY AIN'T GOT TO GET UP.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I'M ON MY WAY,
NO PROBLEM.
"WHERE YOU AT?"

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I MEAN, THEY COULD BE
IN TIMBUKTU,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
I'M FIXING TO GO
TO THE 76,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
PUT MY GAS IN,
AND I'M ON MY WAY
TO TIMBUKTU,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
AND SO, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
THAT'S WHAT IT IS WITH ME.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
THAT'S HOW IT'S BEEN FOR ME.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Gamble: YOU GOT 8 MONTHS
LEFT ON SUPERVISION,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
BUT THEN YOU ALSO GOT
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
WE CAN DO THE WHOLE
PAROLE THING,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
AND YOU DON'T SHOW UP,
YOU GET A WARRANT
AND GO TO JAIL.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
WE BEEN DOING THAT.
I CALL THAT THE DANCE,

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
AND YOU AND I BEEN
DOING THAT DANCE,

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
YOU KNOW,
BUT HERE WE ARE,
SAME QUESTION.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
WHAT IS IT GONNA TAKE
FOR YOU?

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
THE MISTAKE I MADE
WAS I STARTED
LETTING COMPLICATIONS

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
INTERFERE WITH WHAT
I WAS TRYING TO DO
WITH MY OWN LIFE.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I GOT INVOLVED
IN A RELATIONSHIP
THAT, UH--

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
LORD HAVE MERCY--

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
WAS REALLY
DETRIMENTAL TO ME.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
YOU KNOW, IN
THE AFRICAN AMERICAN
PROGRAM,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
THEY MENTIONED
SOMETHING ABOUT AS
FAR AS MINORITIES

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
IF WE HAVE ANY
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
LIKE DEPRESSION,
FOR EXAMPLE.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED
WITH DEPRESSION
MYSELF,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
AND, YOU KNOW,
I DIDN'T WANT TO
ADMIT TO MYSELF.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
I WAS LIKE,
I DON'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEMS.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I DON'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEMS.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
I DID IF I KEEP
DOING INSANE THINGS,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
AND I FINALLY
ADMITTED TO MYSELF

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
THAT, HEY, MAYBE
I SHOULD SO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
SO I GOT AHOLD
OF CASCADIA,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
AND I HAVE A DOCTOR
THERE NOW.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'M GONNA GIVE HIM
A CALL LATER ON TODAY

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
AND SEE ABOUT
SEEING HIM SOMETIME
THIS WEEK OR NEXT

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
JUST TO SIT DOWN
AND RAP TO THE MAN.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:51.000
IF YOU DON'T PICK UP
A NEW CRIME BEFORE
THE 8 MONTHS IS DONE

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
AND YOU STAY CLEAN
AND SOBER, GREAT.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
IF YOU DON'T PICK UP
A NEW CRIME

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
AND YOU KEEP USING,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
THEN WE CONTINUE
TO DO THAT DANCE, YOU KNOW,

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
UNTIL THE 8 MONTHS
IS UP,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
AND THEN--AND THEN
FROM THAT POINT,

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
YOU'RE KIND OF
ON YOUR OWN,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
BUT HOPEFULLY,
YOU KNOW, BY THE TIME

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
THIS 8 MONTHS IS DONE,
YOU DO HAVE SOME STABILITY.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
LIKE LAST NIGHT
FOR EXAMPLE,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
WHEN I GOT DONE
WORKING,

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
UM, THE FIRST THING
I DID WAS GO BACK
TO SALVATION ARMY.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
THAT'S MY HOME
FOR NOW.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
SO AS SOON AS I GOT
MY LITTLE BITTY
PAYCHECK,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I WENT
STRAIGHT HOME-
HA HA HA--

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
AND DID MY LAUNDRY,
ATE,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
AND JUST TOOK
IT EASY,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
JUST DID
THE RIGHT THING,
YOU KNOW,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
AND, UH, YOU KNOW
THEY SAY

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
NOTHING BREEDS
SUCCESS LIKE
SUCCESS,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
SO YESTERDAY
WAS A SUCCESSFUL
DAY FOR ME.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
YOU'RE OFF IN 8 MONTHS.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Gamble, voice-over:
SO WE HOPE THAT RICHARD COMES
IN HERE A MONTH FROM NOW,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
AND HE'S WORKING,
AND HE'S GOT EMPLOYMENT,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE HOPE,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
BUT IF HE DOESN'T
AND HE STARTS USING,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
THEN WE DO THAT DANCE AGAIN,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
AND THAT'S WHERE IT IS
RIGHT NOW.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
ALL RIGHT, RICHARD.
THANK YOU.
