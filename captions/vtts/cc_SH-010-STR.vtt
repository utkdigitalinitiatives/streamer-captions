00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:12.370


2
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.300
If music be the food oflove, play on;

3
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.200
Give me excess of it,that, surfeiting,

4
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.030
The appetite may sicken,and so die.

5
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.900
That strain again! it hada dying fall:

6
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.070
O, it came o'er my earlike the sweet sound,

7
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.370
That breathes upon a bankof violets,

8
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.200
Stealing and giving odour!Enough; no more:

9
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.900
'Tis not so sweet now asit was before.

10
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.900
O spirit of love! howquick and fresh art thou,

11
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.630
That, notwithstanding thycapacity

12
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.770
Receiveth as the sea,nought enters there,

13
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.600
Of what validity and pitchsoe'er,

14
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.470
But falls into abatementand low price,

15
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.670
Even in a minute: so fullof shapes is fancy

16
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.230
That it alone is highfantastical.

17
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.730
Will you go hunt, my lord?

18
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.400
What, Curio?

19
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.300
The hart.

20
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.300
Why, so I do, the noblestthat I have:

21
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.100
O, when mine eyes did seeOlivia first,

22
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.700
Methought she purged theair of pestilence!

23
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.600
That instant was I turn'dinto a hart;

24
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.970
And my desires, like felland cruel hounds,

25
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.100
E'er since pursue me.

26
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.670
How now! what news fromher?

27
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.170
So please my lord, I mightnot be admitted;

28
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.100
But from her handmaid doreturn this answer:

29
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.970
The element itself, tillseven years' heat,

30
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.500
Shall not behold her faceat ample view;

31
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.430
But, like a cloistress,she will veiled walk

32
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.470
And water once a day herchamber round

33
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.800
With eye-offending brine:all this to season

34
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.970
A brother's dead love,which she would keep fresh

35
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.530
And lasting in her sadremembrance.

36
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.130
O, she that hath a heartof that fine frame

37
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.070
To pay this debt of lovebut to a brother,

38
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.270
How will she love, whenthe rich golden shaft

39
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.200
Hath kill'd the flock ofall affections else

40
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.170
That live in her; whenliver, brain and heart,

41
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.700
These sovereign thrones, areall supplied, and fill'd

42
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.470
Her sweet perfections withone self king!

43
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.500
Away before me to sweetbeds of flowers:

44
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.600
Love-thoughts lie richwhen canopied with bowers.

45
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.870
What country, friends, isthis?

46
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.070
This is Illyria, lady.

47
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.600
And what should I do inIllyria?

48
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.100
My brother he is inElysium.

49
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.630
Perchance he is not drown'd:what think you, sailors?

50
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.600
It is perchance that youyourself were saved.

51
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.730
O my poor brother! and soperchance may he be.

52
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.800
True, madam: and, tocomfort you with chance,

53
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.100
Assure yourself, after ourship did split,

54
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.770
When you and those poornumber saved with you

55
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.500
Hung on our driving boat,I saw your brother,

56
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.370
Most provident in peril,bind himself,

57
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.830
Courage and hope bothteaching him the practise,

58
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.670
To a strong mast thatlived upon the sea;

59
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.230
Where, like Arion on thedolphin's back,

60
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.970
I saw him hold acquaintancewith the waves

61
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.300
So long as I could see.

62
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.930
For saying so, there'sgold:

63
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.530
Mine own escape unfoldethto my hope,

64
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.530
Whereto thy speech servesfor authority,

65
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.800
The like of him. Know'stthou this country?

66
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.400
Ay, madam, well; for I wasbred and born

67
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.370
Not three hours' travelfrom this very place.

68
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.770
Who governs here?

69
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.670
A noble duke, in nature asin name.

70
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.370
What is the name?

71
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.300
Orsino.

72
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.530
Orsino! I have heard myfather name him:

73
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.530
He was a bachelor then.

74
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.430
And so is now, or was sovery late;

75
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.970
For but a month ago I wentfrom hence,

76
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.470
And then 'twas fresh inmurmur,--as, you know,

77
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.570
What great ones do theless will prattle of,--

78
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.100
That he did seek the loveof fair Olivia.

79
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.800
What's she?

80
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.570
A virtuous maid, thedaughter of a count

81
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.400
That died some twelvemonthsince, then leaving her

82
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.870
In the protection of hisson, her brother,

83
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.730
Who shortly also died: forwhose dear love,

84
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.630
They say, she hath abjuredthe company

85
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.730
And sight of men.

86
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.970
O that I served that lady

87
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.970
And might not be deliveredto the world,

88
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.630
Till I had made mine ownoccasion mellow,

89
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.230
What my estate is!

90
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.470
That were hard to compass;

91
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.170
Because she will admit nokind of suit,

92
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.130
No, not the duke's.

93
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.870
There is a fair behaviorin thee, captain;

94
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.800
And though that naturewith a beauteous wall

95
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.670
Doth oft close inpollution, yet of thee

96
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.330
I will believe thou hast amind that suits

97
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.430
With this thy fair andoutward character.

98
00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.900
I prithee, and I'll paythee bounteously,

99
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.830
Conceal me what I am, andbe my aid

100
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.130
For such disguise as haplyshall become

101
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.530
The form of my intent.I'll serve this duke:

102
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.730
Thou shall present me asan eunuch to him:

103
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.070
It may be worth thy pains;for I can sing

104
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.070
And speak to him in manysorts of music

105
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.100
That will allow me veryworth his service.

106
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.370
What else may hap to timeI will commit;

107
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.000
Only shape thou thysilence to my wit.

108
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.070
Be you his eunuch, andyour mute I'll be:

109
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.270
When my tongue blabs, thenlet mine eyes not see.

110
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.470
I thank thee: lead me on.

111
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.670
What a plague means my niece,

112
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.670
to take the death ofher brother thus?

113
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.570
I am sure care'san enemy to life.

114
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:57.470
By my troth, Sir Toby, you mustcome in earlier o' nights:

115
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.030
your cousin, mylady, takes great

116
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.530
exceptions to your illhours.

117
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.000
Why, let her except,before excepted.

118
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.230
Ay, but you must confineyourself within the modest

119
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.330
limits of order.

120
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.700
Confine! I'll confinemyself no finer than I am:

121
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.230
these clothes are goodenough to drink in;

122
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.230
and so be these bootstoo: an they be not,

123
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.600
let them hang themselvesin their own straps.

124
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.300
That quaffing anddrinking will undo you:

125
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.530
I heard my lady talkof it yesterday;

126
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.430
and of a foolish knight

127
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.570
that you brought in onenight here to be her wooer.

128
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.900
Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?

129
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.370
Ay, he.

130
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.800
He's as tall a man asany's in Illyria.

131
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.030
What's that to thepurpose?

132
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.330
Why, he has three thousandducats a year.

133
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.970
Ay, but he'll have but ayear in all these ducats:

134
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.070
he's a very fool and aprodigal.

135
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.900
Fie, that you'll say so! heplays o' the viol-de-gamboys,

136
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.330
and speaks threeor four languages

137
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.300
word for word without book,

138
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.870
and hath all the goodgifts of nature.

139
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.330
He hath indeed, almost natural:

140
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.930
for besides that he's a fool,he's a great quarreller:

141
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.030
and but that he hath thegift of a coward to allay

142
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.300
the gust he hath in quarrelling,'tis thought among the prudent

143
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.570
he would quickly have thegift of a grave.

144
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.530
By this hand, they arescoundrels and subtractors

145
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.070
that say so of him. Whoare they?

146
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.970
They that add, moreover, he'sdrunk nightly in your company.

147
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.800
With drinking healthsto my niece:

148
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.230
I'll drink to her as long asthere is a passage in my throat

149
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.700
and drink in Illyria: he'sa coward and a coystrill

150
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.900
that will not drink to myniece till his brains turn

151
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.370
o' the toe like aparish-top. What, wench!

152
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:35.030
Castiliano vulgo! for herecomes Sir Andrew Agueface.

153
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:47.600
Sir Toby Belch! how now,Sir Toby Belch!

154
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.970
Sweet Sir Andrew!

155
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.430
Bless you, fair shrew.

156
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.400
And you too, sir.

157
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.730
Accost, Sir Andrew,accost.

158
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:54.630
What's that?

159
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.800
My niece's chambermaid.

160
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.970
Good Mistress Accost, Idesire better acquaintance.

161
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.370
My name is Mary, sir.

162
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.630
Good Mistress MaryAccost,--

163
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.830
You mistake, knight;'accost' is front her,

164
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.400
board her, woo her, assail her.

165
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.730
By my troth, I would notundertake her in this company.

166
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.070
Is that the meaningof 'accost'?

167
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.230
Fare you well, gentlemen.

168
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.730
An thou let partso, Sir Andrew,

169
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.430
would thou mightst neverdraw sword again.

170
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.870
An you part so, mistress,

171
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.000
I would I might neverdraw sword again.

172
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.370
Fair lady, do you thinkyou have fools in hand?

173
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.500
Sir, I have not you by thehand.

174
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.830
Marry, but you shall have;and here's my hand.

175
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.430
Now, sir, 'thought isfree:' I pray you,

176
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.900
bring your hand to thebuttery-bar and let it drink.

177
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.800
Wherefore, sweet-heart?what's your metaphor?

178
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.000
It's dry, sir.

179
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.670
Why, I think so: Iam not such an ass

180
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.130
but I can keep my hand dry.But what's your jest?

181
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.330
A dry jest, sir.

182
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:48.300
Are you full of them?

183
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.970
Ay, sir, I have themat my fingers' ends:

184
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:56.400
marry, now I let go yourhand, I am barren.

185
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.870
O knight thou lackesta cup of canary:

186
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.100
when did I seethee so put down?

187
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.630
Never in your life, I think;

188
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.830
unless you seecanary put me down.

189
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.570
Methinks sometimesI have no more wit

190
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.330
than a Christian oran ordinary man has:

191
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.630
but I am a great eater of beef

192
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.030
and I believe thatdoes harm to my wit.

193
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.930
No question.

194
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.700
An I thought that,I'ld forswear it.

195
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.700
I'll ride hometo-morrow, Sir Toby.

196
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.570
Pourquoi, my dear knight?

197
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.630
What is 'Pourquoi'?do or not do?

198
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.700
I would I had bestowedthat time in the tongues

199
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.970
that I have in fencing,dancing and bear-baiting:

200
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.570
O, had I but followed the arts!

201
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.770
Then hadst thou had anexcellent head of hair.

202
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.200
Why, would that havemended my hair?

203
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.570
Past question; for thou seestit will not curl by nature.

204
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.900
But it becomes me wellenough, does't not?

205
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.830
Excellent; it hangs likeflax on a distaff;

206
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.800
and I hope to see a housewifetake thee between her legs

207
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.230
and spin it off.

208
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.200
Faith, I'll hometo-morrow, Sir Toby:

209
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.900
your niece will not beseen; or if she be,

210
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.070
it's four to oneshe'll none of me:

211
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.970
the count himself herehard by woos her.

212
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.470
She'll none o' the count: she'llnot match above her degree,

213
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:06.870
neither in estate,years, nor wit;

214
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:13.030
I have heard her swear't.Tut, there's life in't, man.

215
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.900
I'll stay a month longer.

216
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.830
I am a fellow o' thestrangest mind i' the world;

217
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:21.700
I delight in masques andrevels sometimes altogether.

218
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.900
Art thou good at thesekickshawses, knight?

219
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.130
As any man in Illyria,whatsoever he be,

220
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.430
under the degree of my betters;

221
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.500
and yet I will notcompare with an old man.

222
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.130
What is thy excellence ina galliard, knight?

223
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.970
Faith, I can cut a caper.

224
00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:35.400
And I can cut the muttonto't.

225
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.430
And I think I have theback-trick simply as strong

226
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.300
as any man in Illyria.

227
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.900
Wherefore are these things hid?

228
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.470
wherefore have these giftsa curtain before 'em?

229
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.500
are they like to take dust,like Mistress Mall's picture?

230
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.400
why dost thou not go tochurch in a galliard

231
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.270
and come home in a coranto? Myvery walk should be a jig;

232
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:57.470
I would not so much as makewater but in a sink-a-pace.

233
00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.700
What dost thou mean? Is it aworld to hide virtues in?

234
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:05.100
I did think, by the excellentconstitution of thy leg,

235
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.170
it was formed under thestar of a galliard.

236
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.270
Ay, 'tis strong, and itdoes indifferent well

237
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.670
in a flame-coloured stock. Shallwe set about some revels?

238
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.000
What shall we do else?were we not born under Taurus?

239
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.200
Taurus! That's sides andheart.

240
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.770
No, sir; it is legs andthighs. Let me see the caper;

241
00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:29.630
ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!

242
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.570
If the duke continue thesefavours towards you, Cesario,

243
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.430
you are like to bemuch advanced:

244
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.570
he hath known youbut three days,

245
00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.600
and already youare no stranger.

246
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.730
You either fear hishumour or my negligence,

247
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.570
that you call in question thecontinuance of his love:

248
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.470
is he inconstant, sir, inhis favours?

249
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.130
No, believe me.

250
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.370
I thank you. Here comesthe count.

251
00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.830
Who saw Cesario, ho?

252
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.830
On your attendance, mylord; here.

253
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:03.200
Stand you a while aloof,Cesario,

254
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.530
Thou know'st no less butall; I have unclasp'd

255
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.470
To thee the book even ofmy secret soul:

256
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.200
Therefore, good youth,address thy gait unto her;

257
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.670
Be not denied access,stand at her doors,

258
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.830
And tell them, there thyfixed foot shall grow

259
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.830
Till thou have audience.

260
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:18.930
Sure, my noble lord,

261
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.400
If she be so abandon'd toher sorrow

262
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.900
As it is spoke, she neverwill admit me.

263
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.100
Be clamorous and leap allcivil bounds

264
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.970
Rather than makeunprofited return.

265
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.870
Say I do speak with her,my lord, what then?

266
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.930
O, then unfold the passionof my love,

267
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.470
Surprise her with discourseof my dear faith:

268
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.770
It shall become thee wellto act my woes;

269
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.930
She will attend it betterin thy youth

270
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.970
Than in a nuncio's of moregrave aspect.

271
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.470
I think not so, my lord.

272
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.470
Dear lad, believe it;

273
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.670
For they shall yet beliethy happy years,

274
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.770
That say thou art a man:Diana's lip

275
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.630
Is not more smooth andrubious; thy small pipe Is

276
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:02.830
as the maiden's organ,shrill and sound,

277
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.370
And all is semblativea woman's part.

278
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.330
I know thy constellationis right apt

279
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.570
For this affair. Some fouror five attend him;

280
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:15.230
All, if you will; for Imyself am best

281
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.530
When least in company.Prosper well in this,

282
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.000
And thou shalt live asfreely as thy lord,

283
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.770
To call his fortunesthine.

284
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:23.700
I'll do my best

285
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.370
To woo your lady:

286
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.430
yet, a barful strife!

287
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:35.170
Whoe'er I woo, myselfwould be his wife.

288
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.470
Nay, either tell mewhere thou hast been,

289
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.500
or I will not open my lips sowide as a bristle may enter

290
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.700
in way of thy excuse: my ladywill hang thee for thy absence.

291
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.970
Let her hang me:

292
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.330
he that is well hanged in thisworld needs to fear no colours.

293
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.430
Make that good.

294
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.500
He shall see none to fear.

295
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.630
A good lenten answer:

296
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.200
I can tell thee wherethat saying was born,

297
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.730
of 'I fear no colours.'

298
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.000
Where, good Mistress Mary?

299
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.970
In the wars; and that may yoube bold to say in your foolery.

300
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.930
Well, God give themwisdom that have it;

301
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.570
and those that are fools,let them use their talents.

302
00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.270
Yet you will be hanged forbeing so long absent;

303
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:16.200
or, to be turned away,

304
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.030
is not that as goodas a hanging to you?

305
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.200
Many a good hangingprevents a bad marriage;

306
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.500
and, for turning away,let summer bear it out.

307
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.570
You are resolute, then?

308
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.570
Not so, neither; but I amresolved on two points.

309
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.700
That if one break, the otherwill hold; or, if both break,

310
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.770
your gaskins fall.

311
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.800
Apt, in good faith; veryapt. Well, go thy way;

312
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.770
if Sir Toby would leavedrinking, thou wert as witty

313
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.270
a piece of Eve's fleshas any in Illyria.

314
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:42.370
Peace, you rogue, no more o'that. Here comes my lady:

315
00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:45.070
make your excusewisely, you were best.

316
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.330
Wit, an't be thy will, putme into good fooling!

317
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:50.530
Those wits, that thinkthey have thee,

318
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.830
do very oft prove fools; andI, that am sure I lack thee,

319
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:57.830
may pass for a wise man:for what says Quinapalus?

320
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.370
'Better a witty fool, thana foolish wit.'

321
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.700
God bless thee, lady!

322
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.770
Take the fool away.

323
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.030
Do you not hear, fellows?Take away the lady.

324
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:09.970
Go to, you're a dry fool;I'll no more of you:

325
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.930
besides, you growdishonest.

326
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.970
Two faults, madonna, thatdrink and good counsel

327
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.800
will amend: for givethe dry fool drink,

328
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.300
then is the fool not dry: bidthe dishonest man mend himself;

329
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.430
if he mend, he is nolonger dishonest;

330
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.470
if he cannot, let thebotcher mend him.

331
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.900
Any thing that's mendedis but patched:

332
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.430
virtue that transgressesis but patched with sin;

333
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:32.630
and sin that amends isbut patched with virtue.

334
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.330
If that this simplesyllogism will serve, so;

335
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.230
if it will not, what remedy?

336
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:42.930
As there is no true cuckold butcalamity, so beauty's a flower.

337
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.130
The lady bade takeaway the fool;

338
00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:45.600
therefore, I sayagain, take her away.

339
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.700
Sir, I bade them take awayyou.

340
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.600
Misprision in the highestdegree!

341
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.630
Good madonna,

342
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.900
give me leave toprove you a fool.

343
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.030
Can you do it?

344
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.200
Dexterously, good madonna.

345
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.100
Make your proof.

346
00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.430
I must catechise youfor it, madonna:

347
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.700
good my mouse ofvirtue, answer me.

348
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.670
Well, sir, for want of otheridleness, I'll bide your proof.

349
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.930
Good madonna, why mournestthou?

350
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.630
Good fool, for mybrother's death.

351
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.770
I think his soul is inhell, madonna.

352
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.000
I know his soul is inheaven, fool.

353
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.700
The more fool, madonna, tomourn for your brother's

354
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.830
soul being in heaven. Takeaway the fool, gentlemen.

355
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:26.400
What think you of this fool,Malvolio? doth he not mend?

356
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.900
Yes, and shall do till thepangs of death shake him:

357
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.570
infirmity, that decays the wise,doth ever make the better fool.

358
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.030
God send you, sir, aspeedy infirmity, for the

359
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.330
better increasing your folly!Sir Toby will be sworn

360
00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.930
that I am no fox; but hewill not pass his word

361
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.030
for two pence thatyou are no fool.

362
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.430
How say you to that,Malvolio?

363
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.630
I marvel your ladyshiptakes delight

364
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.630
in such a barren rascal: I sawhim put down the other day

365
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.470
with an ordinary fool thathas no more brain

366
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:58.000
than a stone. Look you now,he's out of his guard already;

367
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.670
unless you laugh andminister occasion to him,

368
00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:04.270
he is gagged. I protest,I take these wise men,

369
00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.870
that crow so at theseset kind of fools,

370
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.570
no better than thefools' zanies.

371
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.970
Oh, you are sick ofself-love, Malvolio,

372
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.330
and taste with adistempered appetite.

373
00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.030
To be generous, guiltlessand of free disposition,

374
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.970
is to take thosethings for bird-bolts

375
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.030
that you deem cannon-bullets:

376
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.830
there is no slanderin an allowed fool,

377
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:26.200
though he do nothing but rail;

378
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.630
nor no railing in aknown discreet man,

379
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.900
though he do nothingbut reprove.

380
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.270
Now Mercury endue theewith leasing, for thou

381
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.700
speakest well of fools!

382
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.730
Madam, there is at thegate a young gentleman

383
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.900
much desires tospeak with you.

384
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.300
From the Count Orsino, isit?

385
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.070
I know not, madam: 'tis a fairyoung man, and well attended.

386
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.530
Who of my people hold himin delay?

387
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:49.770
Sir Toby, madam, yourkinsman.

388
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.970
Fetch him off, I pray you; hespeaks nothing but madman:

389
00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.000
fie on him!

390
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.170
Go you, Malvolio: if it bea suit from the count,

391
00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:01.600
I am sick, or not at home;what you will, to dismiss it.

392
00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.430
Now you see, sir, howyour fooling grows old,

393
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:09.630
and people dislike it.

394
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.900
Thou hast spokefor us, madonna,

395
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.370
as if thy eldest sonshould be a fool;

396
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:17.170
whose skull Jove cram withbrains! for,--here he comes,

397
00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.070
--one of thy kin has amost weak pia mater.

398
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:24.770
By mine honour, half drunk.What is he at the gate, cousin?

399
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.500
A gentleman.

400
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.570
A gentleman! whatgentleman?

401
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:36.500
'Tis a gentle man here--a plagueo' these pickle-herring!

402
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.770
How now, sot!

403
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:41.270
Good Sir Toby!

404
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.700
Cousin, cousin, how have youcome so early by this lethargy?

405
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:49.870
Lechery! I defy lechery.There's one at the gate.

406
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.530
Ay, marry, what is he?

407
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.100
Let him be the devil, anhe will, I care not:

408
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.500
give me faith, say I.Well, it's all one.

409
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.630
What's a drunken man like,fool?

410
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.600
Like a drowned man, afool and a mad man:

411
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.370
one draught above heatmakes him a fool;

412
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.500
the second mads him; anda third drowns him.

413
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.870
Go thou and seek the crowner,and let him sit o' my coz;

414
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.370
for he's in the thirddegree of drink,

415
00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:22.170
he's drowned: go,look after him.

416
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.100
He is but mad yet, madonna;

417
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.270
and the fool shalllook to the madman.

418
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.400
Madam, yond young fellow swearshe will speak with you.

419
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.970
I told him you were sick;

420
00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.400
he takes on him tounderstand so much,

421
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.830
and therefore comesto speak with you.

422
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.170
I told him you were asleep;

423
00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.970
he seems to have aforeknowledge of that too,

424
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.600
and therefore comesto speak with you.

425
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.370
What is to be saidto him, lady?

426
00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.800
he's fortifiedagainst any denial.

427
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.030
Tell him he shall notspeak with me.

428
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.700
Has been told so; and he says,he'll stand at your door

429
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.600
like a sheriff's post, and bethe supporter to a bench,

430
00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.800
but he'll speak with you.

431
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.430
What kind o' man is he?

432
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.200
Why, of mankind.

433
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.430
What manner of man?

434
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.030
Of very ill manner; he'll speakwith you, will you or no.

435
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.970
Of what personage andyears is he?

436
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.770
Not yet old enough for a man,nor young enough for a boy;

437
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.770
as a squash is before'tis a peascod,

438
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.630
or a cooling when 'tis almostan apple: 'tis with him

439
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.930
in standing water,between boy and man.

440
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:25.000
He is very well-favoured andhe speaks very shrewishly;

441
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.400
one would think his mother'smilk were scarce out of him.

442
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.830
Let him approach: call inmy gentlewoman.

443
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.670
Gentlewoman, my ladycalls.

444
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:39.030
Give me my veil: come,throw it o'er my face.

445
00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:46.200
We'll once more hearOrsino's embassy.

446
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.600
The honourable lady of thehouse, which is she?

447
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.670
Speak to me; I shallanswer for her.

448
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:54.670
Your will?

449
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:59.600
Most radiant, exquisiteand unmatchable beauty,

450
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.930
--I pray you, tell me if thisbe the lady of the house,

451
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.030
for I never saw her: Iwould be loath to cast away

452
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:07.800
my speech, for besides that itis excellently well penned,

453
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.830
I have taken greatpains to con it.

454
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:13.130
Good beauties, let mesustain no scorn;

455
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.030
I am very comptible, even tothe least sinister usage.

456
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.300
Whence came you, sir?

457
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.800
I can say little morethan I have studied,

458
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.800
and that question's out ofmy part. Good gentle one,

459
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.230
give me modest assurance ifyou be the lady of the house,

460
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.070
that I may proceed in myspeech.

461
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.800
Are you a comedian?

462
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.800
No, my profound heart: andyet, by the very fangs

463
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.870
of malice I swear, Iam not that I play.

464
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.700
Are you the ladyof the house?

465
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.470
If I do not usurp myself,I am.

466
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:44.170
Most certain, if you areshe, you do usurp yourself;

467
00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:47.530
for what is yours to bestowis not yours to reserve.

468
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.470
But this is from my commission:

469
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.370
I will on with myspeech in your praise,

470
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.770
and then show you theheart of my message.

471
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.800
Come to what is important in't:I forgive you the praise.

472
00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.800
Alas, I took great pains tostudy it, and 'tis poetical.

473
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.270
It is the more liketo be feigned:

474
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.470
I pray you, keep it in. I heardyou were saucy at my gates,

475
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.930
and allowed your approachrather to wonder at you

476
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:11.330
than to hear you. If yoube not mad, be gone;

477
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:13.830
if you have reason, bebrief: 'tis not that time

478
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.800
of moon with me to make onein so skipping a dialogue.

479
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.500
Will you hoist sail, sir?here lies your way.

480
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.300
No, good swabber; I am tohull here a little longer.

481
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.730
Some mollification foryour giant, sweet lady.

482
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.430
Tell me your mind:I am a messenger.

483
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.070
Sure, you have some hideousmatter to deliver,

484
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:36.270
when the courtesy of it is sofearful. Speak your office.

485
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:42.000
It alone concerns your ear.I bring no overture of war,

486
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.170
no taxation of homage: Ihold the olive in my hand;

487
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.600
my words are as funof peace as matter.

488
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.800
Yet you began rudely. Whatare you? what would you?

489
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.370
The rudeness thathath appeared in me

490
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.800
have I learned frommy entertainment.

491
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.000
What I am, and what I would,

492
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.730
are as secret as maidenhead;to your ears, divinity,

493
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.870
to any other's, profanation.

494
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:09.930
Give us the place alone: wewill hear this divinity.

495
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.600
Now, sir, what is yourtext?

496
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.800
Most sweet lady,--

497
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.670
A comfortable doctrine, andmuch may be said of it.

498
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:22.070
Where lies your text?

499
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.070
In Orsino's bosom.

500
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.230
In his bosom! In whatchapter of his bosom?

501
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.870
To answer by the method,in the first of his heart.

502
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:33.330
O, I have read it:it is heresy.

503
00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.430
Have you no more to say?

504
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:39.830
Good madam, let me seeyour face.

505
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.570
Have you any commissionfrom your lord to negotiate

506
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:45.500
with my face? You arenow out of your text:

507
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:50.470
but we will draw the curtainand show you the picture.

508
00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:54.400
Look you, sir, such aone I was this present:

509
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.600
is't not well done?

510
00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.230
Excellently done, if Goddid all.

511
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:04.700
'Tis in grain, sir; 'twillendure wind and weather.

512
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.300
'Tis beauty truly blent,whose red and white

513
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.730
Nature's own sweet andcunning hand laid on:

514
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.000
Lady, you are thecruell'st she alive,

515
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.770
If you will lead thesegraces to the grave

516
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.400
And leave the world nocopy.

517
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.030
O, sir, I will notbe so hard-hearted;

518
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.930
I will give out diversschedules of my beauty:

519
00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.730
it shall be inventoried, andevery particle and utensil

520
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:31.930
labelled to my will: as,item, two lips,

521
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.500
indifferent red;item, two grey eyes,

522
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.800
with lids to them; item, oneneck, one chin, and so forth.

523
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.270
Were you sent hitherto praise me?

524
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:44.570
I see you what you are,you are too proud;

525
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:50.700
But, if you were thedevil, you are fair.

526
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:56.300
My lord and master lovesyou: O, such love

527
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.300
Could be but recompensed,though you were crown'd

528
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.070
The nonpareil of beauty!

529
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.470
How does he love me?

530
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.170
With adorations, fertiletears,

531
00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:10.070
With groans that thunderlove, with sighs of fire.

532
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.970
Your lord does know mymind; I cannot love him:

533
00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.830
Yet I suppose himvirtuous, know him noble,

534
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:20.170
Of great estate, of freshand stainless youth;

535
00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:25.670
In voices well divulged,free, learn'd and valiant;

536
00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.100
And in dimension and theshape of nature

537
00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.270
A gracious person: but yetI cannot love him;

538
00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:32.670
He might have took hisanswer long ago.

539
00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:34.730
If I did love you in mymaster's flame,

540
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.170
With such a suffering,such a deadly life,

541
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.570
In your denial I wouldfind no sense;

542
00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:41.770
I would not understand it.

543
00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:47.070
Why, what would you?

544
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.070
Make me a willow cabin atyour gate,

545
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.970
And call upon my soulwithin the house;

546
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.500
Write loyal cantons ofcontemned love

547
00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:00.270
And sing them loud even inthe dead of night;

548
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.000
Halloo your name to thereverberate hills

549
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
And make the babblinggossip of the air

550
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.900
Cry out 'Olivia!' O, Youshould not rest

551
00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.370
Between the elements ofair and earth,

552
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.770
But you should pity me!

553
00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.130
You might do much.

554
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.000
What is your parentage?

555
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.930
Above my fortunes, yet mystate is well:

556
00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.600
I am a gentleman.

557
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.800
Get you to your lord;

558
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.270
I cannot love him: let himsend no more;

559
00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:35.200
Unless, perchance, youcome to me again,

560
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:40.000
To tell me how he takesit. Fare you well:

561
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.730
I thank you for yourpains: spend this for me.

562
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.070
I am no fee'd post, lady;keep your purse:

563
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:52.170
My master, not myself,lacks recompense.

564
00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:58.230
Love make his heart offlint that you shall love;

565
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.270
And let your fervor,like my master's,

566
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:05.800
be Placed in contempt!Farewell, fair cruelty.

567
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:10.630
'What is your parentage?'

568
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.600
'Above my fortunes, yet mystate is well:

569
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.300
I am a gentleman.' I'll besworn thou art;

570
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.400
Thy tongue, thy face, thylimbs, actions and spirit,

571
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:26.100
Do give thee five-foldblazon: not too fast:

572
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.500
soft, soft!

573
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:34.070
Unless the master were theman. How now!

574
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:38.100
Even so quickly may onecatch the plague?

575
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.430
Methinks I feel thisyouth's perfections

576
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:42.170
With an invisible andsubtle stealth

577
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:49.100
To creep in at mine eyes.Well, let it be.

578
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.600
What ho, Malvolio!

579
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.030
Here, madam, at yourservice.

580
00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.630
Run after that samepeevish messenger,

581
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:58.170
The county's man: he leftthis ring behind him,

582
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:02.170
Would I or not: tell himI'll none of it.

583
00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.930
Desire him not to flatterwith his lord,

584
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:06.200
Nor hold him up withhopes; I am not for him:

585
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.500
If that the youth willcome this way to-morrow,

586
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.100
I'll give him reasonsfor't: hie thee, Malvolio.

587
00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.730
Madam, I will.

588
00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.970
I do I know not what, andfear to find

589
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:22.300
Mine eye too great aflatterer for my mind.

590
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.500
Fate, show thy force:ourselves we do not owe;

591
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:34.270
What is decreed must be,and be this so.

592
00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.100
Were not you even now withthe Countess Olivia?

593
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.100
Even now, sir; on amoderate pace I have since

594
00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.370
arrived but hither.

595
00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.170
She returns thisring to you, sir:

596
00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:47.400
you might havesaved me my pains,

597
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.800
to have taken itaway yourself.

598
00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.770
She adds, moreover, thatyou should put your lord

599
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.500
into a desperate assuranceshe will none of him:

600
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.830
and one thing more, thatyou be never so hardy to

601
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:57.130
come again in his affairs,unless it be to report

602
00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.600
your lord's taking ofthis. Receive it so.

603
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.630
She took the ring of me:I'll none of it.

604
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.130
Come, sir, you peevishlythrew it to her;

605
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:07.470
and her will is, itshould be so returned:

606
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:10.530
if it be worth stooping for,there it lies in your eye;

607
00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.800
if not, be it histhat finds it.

608
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:23.070
I left no ring with her:what means this lady?

609
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:29.300
Fortune forbid my outsidehave not charm'd her!

610
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.600
She made good view of me;indeed, so much,

611
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.730
That sure methought hereyes had lost her tongue,

612
00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:37.630
For she did speak instarts distractedly.

613
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:40.400
She loves me, sure; thecunning of her passion

614
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.130
Invites me in thischurlish messenger.

615
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:46.370
None of my lord's ring!why, he sent her none.

616
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:53.430
I am the man: if it be so,as 'tis,

617
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:57.030
Poor lady, she were betterlove a dream.

618
00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:01.500
Disguise, I see, thou arta wickedness,

619
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.830
Wherein the pregnant enemydoes much.

620
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.500
How easy is it for theproper-false

621
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.900
In women's waxen hearts toset their forms!

622
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.630
Alas, our frailty is thecause, not we!

623
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:17.330
For such as we are madeof, such we be.

624
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:21.930
How will this fadge? mymaster loves her dearly;

625
00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.130
And I, poor monster, fondas much on him;

626
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:27.870
And she, mistaken, seemsto dote on me.

627
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:31.930
What will become of this?As I am man,

628
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:34.530
My state is desperate formy master's love;

629
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:37.370
As I am woman,--now alasthe day!--

630
00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:43.230
What thriftless sighsshall poor Olivia breathe!

631
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:47.070
O time! thou must untanglethis, not I;

632
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:50.570
It is too hard a knot forme to untie!

633
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.730
Will you stay no longer?

634
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:56.830
nor will you notthat I go with you?

635
00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:00.230
By your patience, no. Mystars shine darkly over me:

636
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:02.800
the malignancy of my fate mightperhaps distemper yours;

637
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.500
therefore I shall craveof you your leave

638
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.600
that I may bear my evilsalone: it were a bad

639
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.100
recompense for your love,to lay any of them on you.

640
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.170
: Let me yet know of youwhither you are bound.

641
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:18.030
No, sooth, sir: my determinatevoyage is mere extravagancy.

642
00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.400
But I perceive inyou so excellent

643
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.630
a touch of modesty, that youwill not extort from me

644
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:24.570
what I am willing to keep in;

645
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:25.500
therefore it charges me

646
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.300
in manners the ratherto express myself.

647
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:32.500
You must know of me then,Antonio, my name is Sebastian,

648
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.200
which I called Roderigo.My father was that

649
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.470
Sebastian of Messaline, whomI know you have heard of.

650
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:44.270
He left behind himmyself and a sister,

651
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:47.930
both born in an hour: if theheavens had been pleased,

652
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:52.270
would we had so ended! butyou, sir, altered that;

653
00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.370
for some hour before youtook me from the breach of

654
00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:57.930
the sea was my sisterdrowned.

655
00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:00.270
Alas the day!

656
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:03.800
A lady, sir, though it wassaid she much resembled me,

657
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.530
was yet of manyaccounted beautiful:

658
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.800
but, though I could notwith such estimable wonder

659
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:15.400
overfar believe that, yet thusfar I will boldly publish her;

660
00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:20.700
she bore a mind that envycould not but call fair.

661
00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.630
She is drowned already,sir, with salt water,

662
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:29.870
though I seem to drown herremembrance again with more.

663
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.830
Pardon me, sir, your badentertainment.

664
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:38.270
O good Antonio, forgive meyour trouble.

665
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.800
If you will not murderme for my love,

666
00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.070
let me be your servant.

667
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:45.170
If you will not undo whatyou have done, that is,

668
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:49.130
kill him whom you haverecovered, desire it not.

669
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:55.830
Fare ye well at once: mybosom is full of kindness,

670
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:57.700
and I am yet so near themanners of my mother,

671
00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.330
that upon the least occasionmore mine eyes will tell

672
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:03.430
tales of me. I am bound to theCount Orsino's court: farewell.

673
00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:08.800
The gentleness of all thegods go with thee!

674
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.700
I have many enemies inOrsino's court,

675
00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:14.170
Else would I very shortlysee thee there.

676
00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:18.000
But, come what may, I doadore thee so,

677
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:22.730
That danger shall seemsport, and I will go.

678
00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:34.770
Approach, Sir Andrew:

679
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:44.770
not to be abed after midnightis to be up betimes;

680
00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:51.070
and 'diluculo surgere,'thou know'st,--

681
00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:55.370
Nay, my troth, I knownot: but I know,

682
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:57.570
to be up late is to be up late.

683
00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:01.070
A false conclusion: I hateit as an unfilled can.

684
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:04.700
To be up after midnight andto go to bed then, is early:

685
00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.700
so that to go tobed after midnight

686
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:10.830
is to go to bed betimes.

687
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:15.630
Does not our life consistof the four elements?

688
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:18.970
Faith, so they say; but Ithink it rather consists

689
00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:20.530
of eating and drinking.

690
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:22.770
Thou'rt a scholar; let ustherefore eat and drink.

691
00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:26.970
Marian, I say! a stoup ofwine!

692

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:09.430
Of these most brisk andgiddy-paced times:

864
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:10.930
Come, but one verse.

865
00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:13.170
He is not here, so please yourlordship that should sing it.

866
00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.230
Who was it?

867
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:15.900
Feste, the jester, mylord; a fool that the lady

868
00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:17.970
Olivia's father tookmuch delight in.

869
00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:19.100
He is about thehouse. Seek him out,

870
00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:22.300
and play the tune the while.

871
00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:27.000
Come hither, boy:

872
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.030
(♪Music plays)

873
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:31.330
if ever thou shalt love,

874
00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:33.670
In the sweet pangs of itremember me;

875
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:36.900
For such as I am all truelovers are,

876
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.200
Unstaid and skittish inall motions else,

877
00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:41.400
Save in the constant imageof the creature

878
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:47.670
That is beloved. How dostthou like this tune?

879
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:49.630
It gives a very echo tothe seat

880
00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:51.900
Where Love is throned.

881
00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:53.870
Thou dost speak masterly:

882
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:55.270
My life upon't, youngthough thou art,

883
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:57.600
thine eye Hath stay'd uponsome favour that it loves:

884
00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.570
Hath it not, boy?

885
00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:03.170
A little, by your favour.

886
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:03.970
What kind of woman is't?

887
00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:05.300
Of your complexion.

888
00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.570
She is not worth thee,then. What years, i' faith?

889
00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:10.770
About your years, my lord.

890
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.800
Too old by heaven: letstill the woman take

891
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.500
An elder than herself: sowears she to him,

892
00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.570
So sways she level in herhusband's heart:

893
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:22.370
For, boy, however we dopraise ourselves,

894
00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:25.270
Our fancies are more giddyand unfirm,

895
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:28.500
More longing, wavering,sooner lost and worn,

896
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.370
Than women's are.

897
00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:30.830
I think it well, my lord.

898
00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:33.700
Then let thy love beyounger than thyself,

899
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:37.370
Or thy affection cannothold the bent;

900
00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:40.300
For women are as roses,whose fair flower

901
00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.900
Being once display'd, dothfall that very hour.

902
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:46.430
And so they are: alas,that they are so;

903
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:50.000
To die, even when they toperfection grow!

904
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.770
O, fellow, come, the songwe had last night.

905
00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:55.900
Mark it, Cesario, it isold and plain;

906
00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.700
The spinsters and theknitters in the sun

907
00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.870
And the free maids that weavetheir thread with bones

908
00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:03.930
Do use to chant it: it issilly sooth,

909
00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:06.500
And dallies with theinnocence of love,

910
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:09.530
Like the old age.

911
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:10.970
Are you ready, sir?

912
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:15.270
Ay; prithee, sing.

And in sad cypress let mebe laid;

916
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:34.930
Fly away, fly away breath;

917
00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:41.870
I am slain by a fair cruelmaid.

I would have men of suchconstancy put to sea,

that their businessmight be every thing

940
00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.970
and their intent every where;

941
00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:48.570
for that's it that always makesa good voyage of nothing.

942
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:56.000
Farewell. Let all therest give place.

Tell her, my love, morenoble than the world,

946
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.630
Prizes not quantity ofdirty lands;

947
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:14.470
The parts that fortunehath bestow'd upon her,

948
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:18.030
Tell her, I hold asgiddily as fortune;

949
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:19.930
But 'tis that miracle andqueen of gems

950
00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:22.170
That nature pranks her inattracts my soul.

951
00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:24.670
But if she cannot loveyou, sir?

952
00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:25.930
I cannot be so answer'd.

953
00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:30.070
Sooth, but you must.

954
00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:35.530
Say that some lady, asperhaps there is,

955
00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:37.900
Hath for your love a greata pang of heart

956
00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:40.630
As you have for Olivia:you cannot love her;

957
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:43.370
You tell her so; must shenot then be answer'd?

958
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:44.500
There is no woman's sides

959
00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.270
Can bide the beating of sostrong a passion

960
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:49.270
As love doth give myheart; no woman's heart

961
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:53.370
So big, to hold so much;they lack retention

962
00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:56.070
Alas, their love may becall'd appetite,

963
00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:58.670
No motion of the liver,but the palate,

964
00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:03.830
That suffer surfeit,cloyment and revolt;

965
00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:07.630
But mine is all as hungryas the sea,

966
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:12.000
And can digest as much:make no compare

967
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.100
Between that love a womancan bear me

968
00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.230
And that I owe Olivia.

969
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:18.830
Ay, but I know--

970
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:19.700
What dost thou know?

971
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.730
Too well what love womento men may owe:

972
00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:28.270
In faith, they are as trueof heart as we.

973
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:30.270
My father had a daughterloved a man,

974
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:34.130
As it might be, perhaps,were I a woman,

975
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:36.230
I should your lordship.

976
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:37.900
And what's her history?

977
00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:43.000
A blank, my lord. Shenever told her love,

978
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.730
But let concealment, likea worm i' the bud,

979
00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:50.730
Feed on her damask cheek:she pined in thought,

980
00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:52.500
And with a green andyellow melancholy

981
00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:56.030
She sat like patience on amonument,

982
00:52:56.030 --> 00:53:01.670
Smiling at grief. Was notthis love indeed?

983
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:05.170
We men may say more, swearmore: but indeed

984
00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:07.200
Our shows are more thanwill; for still we prove

985
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:11.770
Much in our vows, butlittle in our love.

986
00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:14.700
But died thy sister of herlove, my boy?

987
00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:17.630
I am all the daughters ofmy father's house,

988
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:24.170
And all the brothers too:and yet I know not.

989
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:27.900
Sir, shall I to this lady?

990
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.500
Ay, that's the theme.

991
00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:34.400
To her in haste; give herthis jewel; say,

992
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:44.530
My love can give no place,bide no denay.

993
00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:46.500


994
00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:50.100
Come thy ways, SigniorFabian.

995
00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:53.130
Nay, I'll come: if I losea scruple of this sport,

996
00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:55.270
let me be boiled to deathwith melancholy.

997
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:56.900
Wouldst thou not be gladto have the niggardly

998
00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.900
rascally sheep-biter comeby some notable shame?

999
00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:01.800
I would exult, man: youknow, he brought me out o'

1000
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.930
favour with my lady abouta bear-baiting here.

1001
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:05.830
To anger him we'llhave the bear again;

1002
00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:09.030
and we will fool him black andblue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?

1003
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:11.000
An we do not, it is pityof our lives.

1004
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.730
Here comes the littlevillain.

1005
00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:15.170
How now, my metal ofIndia!

1006
00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:16.930
Get ye all threeinto the box-tree:

1007
00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:18.970
Malvolio's comingdown this walk:

1008
00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:20.100
he has been yonder i' the sun

1009
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.270
practising behavior to hisown shadow this half hour:

1010
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:24.130
observe him, for thelove of mockery;

1011
00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:26.570
for I know this letter will makea contemplative idiot of him.

1012
00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:32.970
Close, in the name ofjesting! Lie thou there,

1013
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:35.630
for here comes the trout thatmust be caught with tickling.

1014
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:48.870
'Tis but fortune;all is fortune.

1015
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:51.970
Maria once told meshe did affect me:

1016
00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:53.800
and I have heard herselfcome thus near,

1017
00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.330
that, should she fancy,it should be one

1018
00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:59.670
of my complexion. Besides,she uses me with a more

1019
00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:04.000
exalted respect than anyone else that follows her.

1020
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.770
What should I think on't?

1021
00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:07.500
Here's an overweeningrogue!

1022
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:10.800
O, peace! Contemplation makesa rare turkey-cock of him:

1023
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:12.300
how he jets under hisadvanced plumes!

1024
00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:14.270
'Slight, I could so beatthe rogue!

1025
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:16.670
Peace, I say.

1026
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:18.370
To be Count Malvolio!

1027
00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:18.930
Ah, rogue!

1028
00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:19.570
Pistol him, pistol him.

1029
00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:21.100
Peace, peace!

1030
00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:23.600
There is example for't;the lady of the Strachy

1031
00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.970
married the yeoman of thewardrobe.

1032
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:27.000
Fie on him, Jezebel!

1033
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.430
O, peace!

1034
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.600
now he's deeply in: lookhow imagination blows him.

1035
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:39.030
Having been threemonths married to her,

1036
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:40.930
sitting in my state,--

1037
00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:43.330
O, for a stone-bow, to hithim in the eye!

1038
00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:47.400
Calling my officers about me,in my branched velvet gown;

1039
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.870
having come froma day-bed,

1040
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:52.230
where I have leftOlivia sleeping,--

1041
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:53.930
Fire and brimstone!

1042
00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:55.330
O, peace, peace!

1043
00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:57.800
And then to have thehumour of state;

1044
00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:00.070
and after a demuretravel of regard,

1045
00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:06.500
telling them I know my place asI would they should do theirs,

1046
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:08.570
to for my kinsman Toby,--

1047
00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:10.200
Bolts and shackles!

1048
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.200
O peace, peace, peace!now, now.

1049
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.570
Seven of my people, withan obedient start,

1050
00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:18.870
make out for him: Ifrown the while;

1051
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:24.570
and perchance wind up watch, orplay with my--some rich jewel.

1052
00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:28.970
Toby approaches;courtesies there to me,--

1053
00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:30.200
Shall this fellow live?

1054
00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.600
Though our silence be drawnfrom us with cars, yet peace.

1055
00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:35.700
I extend my hand to himthus, quenching my familiar

1056
00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:38.600
smile with an austereregard of control,--

1057
00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:41.030
And does not Toby take youa blow o' the lips then?

1058
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:45.900
Saying, 'Cousin Toby, myfortunes having cast me on

1059
00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:48.800
your niece give me thisprerogative of speech,'--

1060
00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.800
What, what?

1061
00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:53.770
'You must amend yourdrunkenness.'

1062
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:55.230
Out, scab!

1063
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:57.500
Nay, patience, or we breakthe sinews of our plot.

1064
00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:59.400
'Besides, you waste thetreasure of your time with

1065
00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.630
a foolish knight,'--

1066
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:02.030
That's me, I warrant you.

1067
00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:03.300
'One Sir Andrew,'--

1068
00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:07.000
I knew 'twas I; for manydo call me fool.

1069
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.030
What employment have wehere?

1070
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:12.070
Now is the woodcock nearthe gin.

1071
00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:15.270
O, peace! and the spiritof humour intimate reading

1072
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:16.530
aloud to him!

1073
00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:19.300
By my life, this is mylady's hand these be her

1074
00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:22.870
very C's, her U's and herT's and thus makes she her

1075
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:26.230
great P's. It is, in contemptof question, her hand.

1076
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:28.570
Her C's, her U's and herT's: why that?

1077
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:33.170
'To the unknown beloved,this, and my good wishes:'

1078
00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:38.200
--her very phrases!By your leave, wax.

1079
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:41.270
Soft! and the impressureher Lucrece,

1080
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:43.570
with which she uses toseal: 'tis my lady.

1081
00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:45.500
To whom should this be?

1082
00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:48.900
This wins him, liver andall.

1083
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:52.000
Jove knows I love: Butwho?

1084
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:52.900
Lips, do not move;

1085
00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:54.370
No man must know.

1086
00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:56.670
'No man must know.'What follows?

1087
00:57:56.670 --> 00:58:00.930
the numbers altered!'No man must know:'

1088
00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:03.130
if this should bethee, Malvolio?

1089
00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:05.570
Marry, hang thee, brock!

1090
00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:08.300
I may command where Iadore;

1091
00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:11.000
But silence, like aLucrece knife,

1092
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
With bloodless stroke myheart doth gore:

1093
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.870
M, O, A, I, doth sway mylife.

1094
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:20.500
A fustian riddle!

1095
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.400
Excellent wench, say I.

1096
00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:27.030
'M, O, A, I, dothsway my life.'

1097
00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:31.170
Nay, but first, let me see,let me see, let me see.

1098
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.230
What dish o' poison hasshe dressed him!

1099
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:36.800
And with what wing thestaniel cheques at it!

1100
00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:40.230
'I may command where I adore.'Why, she may command me:

1101
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:41.930
I serve her; she is my lady.

1102
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:43.630
Why, this is evident toany formal capacity;

1103
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:47.200
there is no obstructionin this: and the end,

1104
00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.000
--what should that alphabeticalposition portend?

1105
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.630
If I could make thatresemble something in me,

1106
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:54.030
--Softly! M, O, A, I,--

1107
00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:57.070
O, ay, make up that: he isnow at a cold scent.

1108
00:58:57.070 --> 00:58:58.470
Sowter will cryupon't for all this,

1109
00:58:58.470 --> 00:59:00.270
though it be asrank as a fox.

1110
00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:04.730
M,--Malvolio; M,--why,that begins my name.

1111
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:05.700
Did not I say hewould work it out?

1112
00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.200
the cur is excellentat faults.

1113
00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.670
M,--but then there is noconsonancy in the sequel;

1114
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:13.100
that suffers under probationA should follow but O does.

1115
00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:15.130
And O shall end, I hope.

1116
00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:17.470
Ay, or I'll cudgel him,and make him cry O!

1117
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:19.830
And then I comes behind.

1118
00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:20.900
Ay, an you had anyeye behind you,

1119
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:22.330
you might see moredetraction at your heels

1120
00:59:22.330 --> 00:59:24.370
than fortunes before you.

1121
00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:30.800
M, O, A, I; this simulationis not as the former:

1122
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.370
and yet, to crush this alittle, it would bow to me,

1123
00:59:32.370 --> 00:59:36.730
for every one of these lettersare in my name. Soft!

1124
00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:39.200
here follows prose.

1125
00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:44.600
'If this fall intothy hand, revolve.

1126
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:52.470
In my stars I am above thee; butbe not afraid of greatness:

1127
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:54.970
some are born great,some achieve greatness,

1128
00:59:54.970 --> 00:59:58.630
and some have greatnessthrust upon 'em.

1129
00:59:58.630 --> 01:00:01.530
Thy Fates open their hands;

1130
01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:02.970
let thy blood andspirit embrace them;

1131
01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:05.930
and, to inure thyself towhat thou art like to be,

1132
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:10.100
cast thy humble sloughand appear fresh.

1133
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.530
Be opposite with a kinsman,surly with servants;

1134
01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:15.630
let thy tongue tang argumentsof state; put thyself into

1135
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:18.070
the trick of singularity:

1136
01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:20.530
she thus advises theethat sighs for thee.

1137
01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:23.700
Remember who commendedthy yellow stockings,

1138
01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.870
and wished to see theeever cross-gartered:

1139
01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:27.770
I say, remember. Goto, thou art made,

1140
01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:29.600
if thou desirest to beso; if not, let me see

1141
01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:32.730
thee a steward still,the fellow of servants,

1142
01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:35.970
and not worthy to touchFortune's fingers. Farewell.

1143
01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:37.330
She that would alterservices with thee,

1144
01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:39.470
THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'

1145
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:41.700
Daylight and champaigndiscovers not more:

1146
01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:47.270
this is open. I will be proud,I will read politic authors,

1147
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:51.300
I will baffle Sir Toby, I willwash off gross acquaintance,

1148
01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:54.030
I will be point-devisethe very man.

1149
01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:58.000
I do not now fool myself, tolet imagination jade me;

1150
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.830
for every reason excites tothis, that my lady loves me.

1151
01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:08.830
She did commend my yellowstockings of late,

1152
01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:11.670
she did praise my legbeing cross-gartered;

1153
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:13.700
and in this she manifestsherself to my love,

1154
01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:16.930
and with a kind of injunctiondrives me to these habits

1155
01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:20.830
of her liking. I thankmy stars I am happy.

1156
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:24.530
I will be strange, stout,in yellow stockings,

1157
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:26.770
and cross-gartered, even withthe swiftness of putting on.

1158
01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:28.670
Jove and my stars be praised!

1159
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:29.970
Here is yet a postscript.

1160
01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:32.900
'Thou canst not choosebut know who I am.

1161
01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:38.830
If thou entertainest my love,let it appear in thy smiling;

1162
01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:40.830
thy smiles become thee well;

1163
01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:42.930
therefore in mypresence still smile,

1164
01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:45.630
dear my sweet, I prithee.'

1165
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:49.030
Jove, I thank thee:I will smile;

1166
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:53.600
I will do everythingthat thou wilt have me.

1167
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:02.070
I will not give my part ofthis sport for a pension

1168
01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:04.230
of thousands to be paidfrom the Sophy.

1169
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:06.770
I could marry this wenchfor this device.

1170
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:07.970
So could I too.

1171
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:10.870
And ask no other dowry withher but such another jest.

1172
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:11.770
Nor I neither.

1173
01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.430
Here comes my noblegull-catcher.

1174
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:15.900
Wilt thou set thy foot o'my neck?

1175
01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.530
Or o' mine either?

1176
01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:19.200
Shall I play myfreedom at traytrip,

1177
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.300
and become thybond-slave?

1178
01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.430
I' faith, or I either?

1179
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:23.130
Why, thou hast puthim in such a dream,

1180
01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:26.030
that when the image of itleaves him he must run mad.

1181
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:27.530
Nay, but say true; does itwork upon him?

1182
01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:30.370
Like aqua-vitae with amidwife.

1183
01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:32.870
If you will then see thefruits of the sport,

1184
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:35.300
mark his first approachbefore my lady:

1185
01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.130
he will come to herin yellow stockings,

1186
01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:39.970
and 'tis a colour sheabhors, and cross-gartered,

1187
01:02:39.970 --> 01:02:44.270
a fashion she detests; andhe will smile upon her,

1188
01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:46.000
which will now be so unsuitableto her disposition,

1189
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.100
being addicted to amelancholy as she is,

1190
01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:52.030
that it cannot but turn himinto a notable contempt.

1191
01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:55.030
If you will see it, follow me.

1192
01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:56.100
To the gates of Tartar,

1193
01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.500
thou most excellentdevil of wit!

1194
01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:01.000
I'll make one too.

1195
01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:13.700
(♪ music plays)

1196
01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.170
Save thee, friend,and thy music:

1197
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:16.830
dost thou live by thy tabour?

1198
01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:18.200
No, sir, I live by thechurch.

1199
01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.370
Art thou a churchman?

1200
01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:21.300
No such matter, sir: Ido live by the church;

1201
01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:22.830
for I do live at my house,

1202
01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:24.600
and my house dothstand by the church.

1203
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.430
Art not thou theLady Olivia's fool?

1204
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:29.100
No, indeed, sir; the LadyOlivia has no folly:

1205
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:31.670
she will keep no fool,sir, till she be married;

1206
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:34.770
and fools are as like husbandsas pilchards are to herrings;

1207
01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:37.300
the husband's the bigger:I am indeed not her fool,

1208
01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.400
but her corrupter of words.

1209
01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.670
I saw thee late at theCount Orsino's.

1210
01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:44.270
Foolery, sir, does walkabout the orb like the sun,

1211
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:46.700
it shines every where.I would be sorry, sir,

1212
01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.270
but the fool should be as oft

1213
01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:49.970
with your master aswith my mistress:

1214
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:51.430
I think I saw yourwisdom there.

1215
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:53.870
Nay, an thou pass upon me,I'll no more with thee.

1216
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:58.100
Hold, there's expenses forthee.

1217
01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:00.570
Now Jove, in his nextcommodity of hair,

1218
01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.630
send thee a beard!

1219
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:05.370
By my troth, I'll tell thee,I am almost sick for one;

1220
01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:09.030
though I would not have it growon my chin. Is thy lady within?

1221
01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:11.470
Would not a pair of thesehave bred, sir?

1222
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:13.870
Yes, being kept togetherand put to use.

1223
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:16.070
I would play Lord Pandarusof Phrygia, sir,

1224
01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:18.000
to bring a Cressidato this Troilus.

1225
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.630
I understand you, sir;'tis well begged.

1226
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:23.330
The matter, I hope,is not great, sir,

1227
01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:27.700
begging but a beggar:Cressida was a beggar.

1228
01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.470
My lady is within, sir.

1229
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:31.730
I will construe tothem whence you come;

1230
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:35.030
who you are and what youwould are out of my welkin,

1231
01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:39.030
I might say 'element,' butthe word is over-worn.

1232
01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:41.830
This fellow is wise enoughto play the fool;

1233
01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:45.600
And to do that well cravesa kind of wit:

1234
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.570
He must observe their moodon whom he jests,

1235
01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:52.170
The quality of persons,and the time,

1236
01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:54.100
And, like the haggard,cheque at every feather

1237
01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:57.070
That comes before his eye.This is a practise

1238
01:04:57.070 --> 01:05:01.100
As full of labour as awise man's art

1239
01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:03.670
For folly that he wiselyshows is fit;

1240
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:07.630
But wise men, folly-fall'n,quite taint their wit.

1241
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:10.200
Save you, gentleman.

1242
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.670
And you, sir.

1243
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:12.770
Dieu vous garde, monsieur.

1244
01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:14.800
Et vous aussi; votreserviteur.

1245
01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.970
I hope, sir, you are; andI am yours.

1246
01:05:17.970 --> 01:05:22.070
Will you encounter thehouse? my niece is desirous

1247
01:05:22.070 --> 01:05:24.200
you should enter, if yourtrade be to her.

1248
01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.170
I am bound to your niece,sir; I mean, she is the

1249
01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:29.470
list of my voyage.

1250
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:31.630
Taste your legs, sir; putthem to motion.

1251
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:34.130
My legs do betterunderstand me, sir, than I

1252
01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:36.570
understand what you mean bybidding me taste my legs.

1253
01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:37.830
I mean, to go, sir, toenter.

1254
01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:40.730
I will answer you withgait and entrance.

1255
01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.930
Most excellentaccomplished lady,

1256
01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:47.300
the heavens rainodours on you!

1257
01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.930
That youth's a rare courtier:'Rain odours;' well.

1258
01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:52.300
My matter hath no voice,to your own most pregnant

1259
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.000
and vouchsafed ear.

1260
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.500
'Odours,' 'pregnant'and 'vouchsafed:'

1261
01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:56.900
I'll get 'em allthree all ready.

1262
01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.530
Let the garden door be shut,and leave me to my hearing.

1263
01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:09.730
Give me your hand, sir.

1264
01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:12.170
My duty, madam, and mosthumble service.

1265
01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:13.230
What is your name?

1266
01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:16.000
Cesario is your servant'sname, fair princess.

1267
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.930
My servant, sir! 'Twasnever merry world

1268
01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:21.800
Since lowly feigning wascall'd compliment:

1269
01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.500
You're servant to theCount Orsino, youth.

1270
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.330
And he is yours, and hismust needs be yours:

1271
01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:28.300
Your servant's servant isyour servant, madam.

1272
01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.400
For him, I think not onhim: for his thoughts,

1273
01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.170
Would they were blanks,rather than fill'd with me!

1274
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:34.600
Madam, I come to whet yourgentle thoughts

1275
01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.600
On his behalf.

1276
01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.130
O, by your leave, I prayyou,

1277
01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:41.300
I bade you never speakagain of him:

1278
01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.700
But, would you undertakeanother suit,

1279
01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.600
I had rather hear you tosolicit that

1280
01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.630
Than music from thespheres.

1281
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:48.500
Dear lady,--

1282
01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.870
Give me leave, beseechyou. I did send,

1283
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:52.900
After the last enchantmentyou did here,

1284
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:55.600
A ring in chase of you: sodid I abuse

1285
01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.570
Myself, my servant and, Ifear me, you:

1286
01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:02.430
Under your hardconstruction must I sit,

1287
01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:04.500
To force that on you, in ashameful cunning,

1288
01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:09.100
Which you knew none ofyours: what might you think?

1289
01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:11.470
Have you not set minehonour at the stake

1290
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:13.300
And baited it with all theunmuzzled thoughts

1291
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:17.170
That tyrannous heart can think?To one of your receiving

1292
01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:20.470
Enough is shown: acypress, not a bosom,

1293
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:26.000
Hideth my heart. So, letme hear you speak.

1294
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.230
I pity you.

1295
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:28.400
That's a degree to love.

1296
01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.870
No, not a grize; for 'tisa vulgar proof,

1297
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:33.970
That very oft we pityenemies.

1298
01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:37.730
Why, then, methinks 'tistime to smile again.

1299
01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:42.200
O, world, how apt the poorare to be proud!

1300
01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.270
If one should be a prey,how much the better

1301
01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:46.800
To fall before the lionthan the wolf!

1302
01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.100
(Clock strikes)

1303
01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:51.600
The clock upbraids me withthe waste of time.

1304
01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.230
Be not afraid, good youth,I will not have you:

1305
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:58.300
And yet, when wit andyouth is come to harvest,

1306
01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:02.430
Your were is alike to reapa proper man:

1307
01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:04.970
There lies your way, duewest.

1308
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:08.300
Then westward-ho! Graceand good disposition

1309
01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:10.500
Attend your ladyship!

1310
01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:18.000
You'll nothing, madam, tomy lord by me?

1311
01:08:20.730 --> 01:08:24.200
Stay:

1312
01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:28.700
I prithee, tell me whatthou thinkest of me.

1313
01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.830
That you do think you arenot what you are.

1314
01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:32.330
If I think so, I think thesame of you.

1315
01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:34.130
Then think you right: I amnot what I am.

1316
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:35.770
I would you were as Iwould have you be!

1317
01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:37.370
Would it be better, madam,than I am?

1318
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:41.430
I wish it might, for now Iam your fool.

1319
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:44.370
O, what a deal of scornlooks beautiful

1320
01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:47.430
In the contempt and angerof his lip!

1321
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:49.800
A murderous guilt showsnot itself more soon

1322
01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:54.730
Than love that would seemhid: love's night is noon.

1323
01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:59.030
Cesario, by the roses ofthe spring,

1324
01:08:59.030 --> 01:09:03.500
By maidhood, honour, truthand every thing,

1325
01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:07.830
I love thee so, that,maugre all thy pride,

1326
01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:11.270
Nor wit nor reason can mypassion hide.

1327
01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:13.000
Do not extort thy reasonsfrom this clause,

1328
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.430
For that I woo, thoutherefore hast no cause,

1329
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:19.870
But rather reason thuswith reason fetter,

1330
01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:24.900
Love sought is good, butgiven unsought better.

1331
01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:27.930
By innocence I swear, andby my youth

1332
01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:31.500
I have one heart, onebosom and one truth,

1333
01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.470
And that no woman has; nornever none

1334
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:39.100
Shall mistress be of it,save I alone.

1335
01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:42.100
And so adieu, good madam:never more

1336
01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:46.200
Will I my master's tearsto you deplore.

1337
01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:50.030
Yet come again; for thouperhaps mayst move

1338
01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:56.230
That heart, which nowabhors, to like his love.

1339
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:12.700
No, faith, I'll not stay ajot longer.

1340
01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:16.100
Thy reason, dear venom,give thy reason.

1341
01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:18.000
You must needs yield yourreason, Sir Andrew.

1342
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.830
Marry, I saw yourniece do more favours

1343
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:22.000
to the count's serving-man thanever she bestowed upon me;

1344
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.600
Did she see thee the while,old boy? tell me that.

1345
01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.730
As plain as I see you now.

1346
01:10:26.730 --> 01:10:29.230
This was a great argumentof love in her toward you.

1347
01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:31.000
'Slight, will you make anass o' me?

1348
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.470
I will prove itlegitimate, sir,

1349
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:33.900
upon the oaths ofjudgment and reason.

1350
01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:36.170
And they have beengrand-jury-men

1351
01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:37.570
since before Noahwas a sailor.

1352
01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:39.570
She did show favour to theyouth in your sight only

1353
01:10:39.570 --> 01:10:43.330
to exasperate you, to awakeyour dormouse valour,

1354
01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:46.930
to put fire in your heart andbrimstone in your liver.

1355
01:10:46.930 --> 01:10:48.430
You should thenhave accosted her;

1356
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:50.830
and with some excellent jests,fire-new from the mint,

1357
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:53.770
you should have bangedthe youth into dumbness.

1358
01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:57.470
This was looked for at yourhand, and this was balked:

1359
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:58.600
the double gilt ofthis opportunity

1360
01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.530
you let time wash off,

1361
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:02.870
and you are now sailed into thenorth of my lady's opinion;

1362
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:04.600
where you will hanglike an icicle

1363
01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:05.900
on a Dutchman's beard,

1364
01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.570
unless you do redeem it

1365
01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:10.570
by some laudable attempteither of valour or policy.

1366
01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:12.170
An't be any way, itmust be with valour;

1367
01:11:12.170 --> 01:11:13.370
for policy I hate:

1368
01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:16.000
Why, then, build me thy fortunesupon the basis of valour.

1369
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.700
Challenge me the count'syouth to fight with him;

1370
01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:21.830
hurt him in eleven places: myniece shall take note of it;

1371
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:23.830
and assure thyself, there isno love-broker in the world

1372
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:27.330
can more prevail in man'scommendation with woman

1373
01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:29.330
than report of valour.

1374
01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:33.770
There is no way but this,Sir Andrew.

1375
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:35.800
Will either of you bear mea challenge to him?

1376
01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:40.170
Go, write it in a martialhand; be curst and brief;

1377
01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:43.000
it is no matter how witty,so it be eloquent and fun

1378
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.970
of invention: taunt himwith the licence of ink:

1379
01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:47.870
if thou thou'sthim some thrice,

1380
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:49.300
it shall not be amiss;

1381
01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:52.300
and as many lies as willlie in thy sheet of paper,

1382
01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.570
although the sheetwere big enough

1383
01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:57.400
for the bed of Ware in England,set 'em down: go, about it.

1384
01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.900
Let there be gallenough in thy ink,

1385
01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:02.870
though thou write with agoose-pen, no matter: about it.

1386
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:05.470
Where shall I find you?

1387
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:09.830
We'll call thee at thecubiculo: go.

1388
01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:14.700
This is a dear manikin toyou, Sir Toby.

1389
01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.270
I have been dear to him, lad,

1390
01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:18.500
some two thousandstrong, or so.

1391
01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:21.800
We shall have a rareletter from him:

1392
01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:22.730
but you'll not deliver't?

1393
01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:24.500
Never trust me, then;

1394
01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:28.230
and by all means stir onthe youth to an answer.

1395
01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:29.800
I think oxen and wainropes

1396
01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:34.200
cannot hale them together. ForAndrew, if he were opened,

1397
01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.030
and you find so muchblood in his liver

1398
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:38.170
as will clog thefoot of a flea,

1399
01:12:38.170 --> 01:12:39.900
I'll eat the restof the anatomy.

1400
01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:40.970
And his opposite, the youth,

1401
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:42.800
bears in his visage nogreat presage of cruelty.

1402
01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:47.900
Look, where the youngestwren of nine comes.

1403
01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:49.530
If you desire the spleen,

1404
01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:52.100
and will laugh yourselfinto stitches, follow me.

1405
01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:55.530
Yond gull Malvolio is turnedheathen, a very renegado;

1406
01:12:55.530 --> 01:12:56.530
for there is no Christian,

1407
01:12:56.530 --> 01:12:58.330
that means to be savedby believing rightly,

1408
01:12:58.330 --> 01:13:00.900
can ever believe such impossiblepassages of grossness.

1409
01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:02.870
He's in yellow stockings.

1410
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:04.300
And cross-gartered?

1411
01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:07.070
Most villanously; like apedant that keeps a school

1412
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:09.330
i' the church. Ihave dogged him,

1413
01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:12.500
like his murderer. He does obeyevery point of the letter

1414
01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.670
that I dropped to betray him:

1415
01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:17.070
he does smile hisface into more lines

1416
01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:20.570
than is in the new map with theaugmentation of the Indies:

1417
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:23.230
you have not seen sucha thing as 'tis.

1418
01:13:23.230 --> 01:13:26.970
I can hardly forbearhurling things at him.

1419
01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:28.430
I know my lady will strike him:

1420
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:32.800
if she do, he'll smile andtake't for a great favour.

1421
01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.470
Come, bring us, bring uswhere he is.

1422
01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:44.870
I would not by my willhave troubled you;

1423
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:46.470
But, since you make yourpleasure of your pains,

1424
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:48.270
I will no further chideyou.

1425
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:50.100
I could not stay behindyou: my desire,

1426
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:53.670
More sharp than filedsteel, did spur me forth;

1427
01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:56.270
And not all love to seeyou, though so much

1428
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:58.670
As might have drawn one toa longer voyage,

1429
01:13:58.670 --> 01:14:00.400
But jealousy what mightbefall your travel,

1430
01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.230
Being skilless in theseparts; which to a stranger,

1431
01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:04.230
Unguided and unfriended,often prove

1432
01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:06.970
Rough and unhospitable: mywilling love,

1433
01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:09.200
The rather by thesearguments of fear,

1434
01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.830
Set forth in your pursuit.

1435
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:12.230
My kind Antonio,

1436
01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:13.770
I can no other answer makebut thanks,

1437
01:14:13.770 --> 01:14:17.100
And thanks; and ever thanksoft good turns

1438
01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:19.370
Are shuffled off with suchuncurrent pay:

1439
01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:22.330
But, were my worth as ismy conscience firm,

1440
01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:25.500
You should find better dealing.

1441
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:28.500
What's to do?

1442
01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:29.900
Shall we go see thereliques of this town?

1443
01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:32.330
To-morrow, sir: best firstgo see your lodging.

1444
01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:34.570
I am not weary, and 'tislong to night:

1445
01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:35.930
I pray you, let us satisfyour eyes

1446
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.630
With the memorials and thethings of fame

1447
01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:39.330
That do renown this city.

1448
01:14:39.330 --> 01:14:40.570
Would you'ld pardon me;

1449
01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:42.700
I do not without dangerwalk these streets:

1450
01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:45.000
Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainstthe count his galleys

1451
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.830
I did some service; ofsuch note indeed,

1452
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:50.270
That were I ta'en here itwould scarce be answer'd.

1453
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:52.430
Belike you slew greatnumber of his people.

1454
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:54.770
The offence is not of sucha bloody nature;

1455
01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:56.170
Albeit the quality of thetime and quarrel

1456
01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:59.530
Might well have given usbloody argument.

1457
01:14:59.530 --> 01:15:01.400
It might have since beenanswer'd in repaying

1458
01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.270
What we took from them;which, for traffic's sake,

1459
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:07.000
Most of our city did: onlymyself stood out;

1460
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.530
For which, if I be lapsedin this place,

1461
01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:09.930
I shall pay dear.

1462
01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:12.770
Do not then walk too open.

1463
01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:19.730
It doth not fit me. Hold,sir, here's my purse.

1464
01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:20.830
In the south suburbs, atthe Elephant,

1465
01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:23.030
Is best to lodge: I willbespeak our diet,

1466
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:25.170
Whiles you beguile the timeand feed your knowledge

1467
01:15:25.170 --> 01:15:28.130
With viewing of the town:there shall you have me.

1468
01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:29.170
Why I your purse?

1469
01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:30.600
Haply your eye shall lightupon some toy

1470
01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.730
You have desire topurchase; and your store,

1471
01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:34.800
I think, is not for idlemarkets, sir.

1472
01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.530
I'll be your purse-bearerand leave you

1473
01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:38.170
For an hour.

1474
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:40.030
To the Elephant.

1475
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:44.000
I do remember.

1476
01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.470
I have sent after him: hesays he'll come;

1477
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:55.530
How shall I feast him?what bestow of him?

1478
01:15:55.530 --> 01:15:59.400
For youth is bought more oftthan begg'd or borrow'd.

1479
01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.570
I speak too loud.

1480
01:16:00.570 --> 01:16:02.870
Where is Malvolio? he issad and civil,

1481
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:06.070
And suits well for aservant with my fortunes:

1482
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:07.300
Where is Malvolio?

1483
01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:11.000
He's coming, madam; butin very strange manner.

1484
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.070
He is, sure, possessed, madam.

1485
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:14.570
Why, what's the matter?does he rave?

1486
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:16.500
No. madam, he doesnothing but smile:

1487
01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.830
your ladyship were best tohave some guard about you,

1488
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:21.870
if he come; for, sure, theman is tainted in's wits.

1489
01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:27.500
Go call him hither.

1490
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.930
I am as mad as he,

1491
01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:35.370
If sad and merry madnessequal be.

1492
01:16:35.370 --> 01:16:39.330
How now, Malvolio!

1493
01:16:39.330 --> 01:16:42.630
Sweet lady, ho, ho.

1494
01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:44.770
Smilest thou?

1495
01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:47.100
I sent for thee upon a sadoccasion.

1496
01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:50.530
Sad, lady! I could be sad:this does make some

1497
01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:52.830
obstruction in the blood,this cross-gartering;

1498
01:16:52.830 --> 01:16:55.930
but what of that? if itplease the eye of one,

1499
01:16:55.930 --> 01:16:58.400
it is with me as thevery true sonnet is,

1500
01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.430
'Please one, and please all.'

1501
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:04.670
Why, how dost thou, man? whatis the matter with thee?

1502
01:17:04.670 --> 01:17:09.400
Not black in my mind,though yellow in my legs.

1503
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:15.670
It did come to his hands, andcommands shall be executed:

1504
01:17:15.670 --> 01:17:18.900
I think we do know thesweet Roman hand.

1505
01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:21.600
Wilt thou go to bed,Malvolio?

1506
01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:27.030
To bed! ay, sweet-heart,and I'll come to thee.

1507
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:28.930
God comfort thee!

1508
01:17:28.930 --> 01:17:32.300
Why dost thou smile so andkiss thy hand so oft?

1509
01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.370
How do you, Malvolio?

1510
01:17:33.370 --> 01:17:36.100
At your request! yes;nightingales answer daws.

1511
01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:37.900
Why appear you with thisridiculous boldness

1512
01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:39.070
before my lady?

1513
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:42.670
'Be not afraid ofgreatness:' 'twas well writ.

1514
01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:44.400
What meanest thou by that,Malvolio?

1515
01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.570
'Some are born great,'--

1516
01:17:45.570 --> 01:17:46.370
Ha!

1517
01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:47.570
'Some achievegreatness,'--

1518
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:49.030
What sayest thou?

1519
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:52.000
'And some have greatnessthrust upon them.'

1520
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.600
Heaven restore thee!

1521
01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.170
'Remember who commendedthy yellow stocking s,'--

1522
01:17:56.170 --> 01:17:57.700
Thy yellow stockings!

1523
01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.930
'And wished to see theecross-gartered.'

1524
01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:01.170
Cross-gartered!

1525
01:18:01.170 --> 01:18:04.400
'Go to thou art made, ifthou desirest to be so;'--

1526
01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.030
Am I made?

1527
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:08.570
'If not, let me see thee aservant still.'

1528
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:14.000
Why, this is verymidsummer madness.

1529
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.800
Madam, the young gentleman ofthe Count Orsino's is returned:

1530
01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.230
I could hardlyentreat him back:

1531
01:18:18.230 --> 01:18:20.100
he attends yourladyship's pleasure.

1532
01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:22.770
I'll come to him.

1533
01:18:22.770 --> 01:18:25.500
Good Maria, let thisfellow be looked to.

1534
01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:26.570
Where's my cousin Toby?

1535
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:29.430
Let some of my people havea special care of him:

1536
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:30.870
I would not have him miscarry

1537
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:33.970
for the half of my dowry.

1538
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:38.530
O, ho! do you come near me now?

1539
01:18:38.530 --> 01:18:42.630
no worse man than SirToby to look to me!

1540
01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:45.230
This concurs directlywith the letter:

1541
01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:46.170
she sends him on purpose,

1542
01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:47.600
that I may appearstubborn to him;

1543
01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.400
for she incites me tothat in the letter.

1544
01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:54.830
'Cast thy humbleslough,' says she;

1545
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:57.770
'be opposite with a kinsman,surly with servants;

1546
01:18:57.770 --> 01:19:00.270
let thy tongue tang witharguments of state;

1547
01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:03.030
put thyself into thetrick of singularity;'

1548
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:05.130
and consequently setsdown the manner how;

1549
01:19:05.130 --> 01:19:09.300
as, a sad face, a reverendcarriage, a slow tongue,

1550
01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:14.300
in the habit of some sirof note, and so forth.

1551
01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:18.600
I have limed her; butit is Jove's doing,

1552
01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:25.570
and Jove make me thankful!And when she went away now,

1553
01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:29.830
'Let this fellow be lookedto:' fellow! not Malvolio,

1554
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:33.170
nor after my degree,but fellow.

1555
01:19:33.170 --> 01:19:35.870
Why, every thingadheres together,

1556
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:37.770
that no dram of a scruple,no scruple of a scruple,

1557
01:19:37.770 --> 01:19:40.830
no obstacle, no incredulousor unsafe circumsta--

1558
01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:45.500
What can be said? Nothing thatcan be can come between me

1559
01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:49.570
and the full prospectof my hopes.

1560
01:19:49.570 --> 01:19:52.970
Well, Jove, not I, isthe doer of this,

1561
01:19:52.970 --> 01:19:54.970
and he is to be thanked.

1562
01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:10.830
Which way is he, inthe name of sanctity?

1563
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:12.870
If all the devils of hellbe drawn in little,

1564
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:15.600
and Legion himself possessedhim, yet I'll speak to him.

1565
01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:20.100
Here he is, here he is.How is't with you, sir?

1566
01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:22.230
how is't with you, man?

1567
01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:28.570
Go off; I discard you: let meenjoy my private: go off.

1568
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:32.200
Lo, how hollow the fiendspeaks within him!

1569
01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.300
did not I tell you?

1570
01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:35.770
Sir Toby, my lady prays youto have a care of him.

1571
01:20:35.770 --> 01:20:37.730
Ah, ha! does she so?

1572
01:20:37.730 --> 01:20:42.630
Go to, go to; peace, peace; wemust deal gently with him:

1573
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:46.930
let me alone. Howdo you, Malvolio?

1574
01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:50.100
how is't with you? What,man! defy the devil:

1575
01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:52.170
consider, he's an enemy tomankind.

1576
01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:53.800
Do you know what you say?

1577
01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.600
La you, an you speakill of the devil,

1578
01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.200
how he takes it at heart! PrayGod, he be not bewitched!

1579
01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.300
Carry his water to thewise woman.

1580
01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:02.000
Marry, and it shall be doneto-morrow morning, if I live.

1581
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.100
My lady would not lose himfor more than I'll say.

1582
01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:06.030
How now, mistress!

1583
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:07.170
O Lord!

1584
01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:09.530
Prithee, hold thy peace;this is not the way:

1585
01:21:09.530 --> 01:21:12.770
do you not see you move him?let me alone with him.

1586
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:16.630
No way but gentleness; gently,gently: the fiend is rough,

1587
01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:21.000
and will not be roughly used.

1588
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.970
Why, how now, my bawcock!how dost thou, chuck?

1589
01:21:25.970 --> 01:21:27.030
Sir!

1590
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:28.430
Get him to say hisprayers, good Sir Toby,

1591
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:29.470
get him to pray.

1592
01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:30.870
My prayers, minx!

1593
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:34.800
No, I warrant you, he willnot hear of godliness.

1594
01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:39.300
Go, hang yourselves all! youare idle shallow things:

1595
01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:40.730
I am not of your element:

1596
01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:43.370
you shall know more hereafter.

1597
01:21:43.770 --> 01:21:50.130
(laughing)

1598
01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:51.670
Is't possible?

1599
01:21:51.670 --> 01:21:53.830
If this were playedupon a stage now,

1600
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:55.770
I could condemn it asan improbable fiction.

1601
01:21:55.770 --> 01:21:59.000
His very genius hath taken theinfection of the device, man.

1602
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.770
Nay, pursue him now, lest thedevice take air and taint.

1603
01:22:01.770 --> 01:22:03.630
Why, we shall make him madindeed.

1604
01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:04.770
The house will be thequieter.

1605
01:22:04.770 --> 01:22:09.500
Come, we'll have him ina dark room and bound.

1606
01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.330
My niece is already in thebelief that he's mad:

1607
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:13.670
we may carry it thus, for ourpleasure and his penance,

1608
01:22:13.670 --> 01:22:15.630
till our very pastime,tired out of breath,

1609
01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:17.230
prompt us to have mercy on him:

1610
01:22:17.230 --> 01:22:19.130
at which time we will bringthe device to the bar

1611
01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:23.630
and crown thee for afinder of madmen.

1612
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:25.170
But see, but see.

1613
01:22:25.170 --> 01:22:27.100
More matter for a May morning.

1614
01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:28.600
Here's the challenge, read it:

1615
01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.470
warrant there's vinegarand pepper in't.

1616
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:31.470
Is't so saucy?

1617
01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:33.300
Ay, is't, I warrant him:do but read.

1618
01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:36.930
Give me.

1619
01:22:36.930 --> 01:22:41.970
'Youth, whatsoever thou art,thou art but a scurvy fellow.'

1620
01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:44.100
Good, and valiant.

1621
01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:47.030
'Wonder not, nor admirenot in thy mind,

1622
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:48.670
why I do call thee so,

1623
01:22:48.670 --> 01:22:52.200
for I will show theeno reason for't.'

1624
01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.870
A good note; that keeps youfrom the blow of the law.

1625
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:57.500
'Thou comest to the ladyOlivia, and in my sight

1626
01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:01.070
she uses thee kindly: butthou liest in thy throat;

1627
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:04.130
that is not the matterI challenge thee for.'

1628
01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:07.400
Very brief, and toexceeding good sense--less.

1629
01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.900
'I will waylay thee going home;

1630
01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:12.630
where if it be thychance to kill me,'--

1631
01:23:12.630 --> 01:23:13.730
Good.

1632
01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:15.630
'Thou killest me like arogue and a villain.'

1633
01:23:15.630 --> 01:23:17.430
Still you keep o' the windyside of the law: good.

1634
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:19.900
'Fare thee well; and Godhave mercy upon

1635
01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:22.330
one of our souls! He mayhave mercy upon mine;

1636
01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:26.230
but my hope is better,and so look to thyself.

1637
01:23:26.230 --> 01:23:29.800
Thy friend, as thou usesthim, and thy sworn enemy,

1638
01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:32.900
ANDREW AGUECHEEK.

1639
01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:35.000
If this letter move himnot, his legs cannot:

1640
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.830
I'll give't him.

1641
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:38.130
You may have veryfit occasion for't:

1642
01:23:38.130 --> 01:23:39.530
he is now in somecommerce with my lady,

1643
01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:40.770
and will by and by depart.

1644
01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:45.970
Go, Sir Andrew: scout me forhim at the corner the orchard

1645
01:23:45.970 --> 01:23:48.670
like a bum-baily: so soonas ever thou seest him,

1646
01:23:48.670 --> 01:23:51.230
draw; and, as thoudrawest swear horrible;

1647
01:23:51.230 --> 01:23:53.070
for it comes to pass oftthat a terrible oath,

1648
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:54.800
with a swaggering accentsharply twanged off,

1649
01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.270
gives manhood more approbation

1650
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:59.200
than ever proof itself wouldhave earned him. Away!

1651
01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:04.030
Nay, let me alone forswearing.

1652
01:24:11.370 --> 01:24:14.930
Now will not Ideliver his letter:

1653
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:16.470
for the behavior ofthe young gentleman

1654
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:19.100
gives him out to be of goodcapacity and breeding;

1655
01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:21.300
his employment betweenhis lord and my niece

1656
01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:23.000
confirms no less:

1657
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.500
therefore this letter, beingso excellently ignorant,

1658
01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:26.870
will breed no terrorin the youth:

1659
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:30.730
he will find it comesfrom a clodpole.

1660
01:24:30.730 --> 01:24:35.000
But, sir, I will deliver hischallenge by word of mouth;

1661
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.470
set upon Aguecheek anotable report of valour;

1662
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:40.100
and drive the gentleman,as I know his

1663
01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:42.200
youth will aptly receiveit, into a most hideous

1664
01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:44.530
opinion of his rage, skill,fury and impetuosity.

1665
01:24:44.530 --> 01:24:46.630
This will so fright themboth that they will kill

1666
01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:49.870
one another by the look,like cockatrices.

1667
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:58.100
I have said too much untoa heart of stone

1668
01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:01.030
And laid mine honour toounchary out:

1669
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:03.730
There's something in methat reproves my fault;

1670
01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:05.870
But such a headstrongpotent fault it is,

1671
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:07.370
That it but mocks reproof.

1672
01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:09.670
With the same 'havior thatyour passion bears

1673
01:25:09.670 --> 01:25:11.100
Goes on my master's grief.

1674
01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:16.000
Here, wear this jewel forme, 'tis my picture;

1675
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.070
Refuse it not; it hath notongue to vex you;

1676
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:23.570
And I beseech you comeagain to-morrow.

1677
01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:25.370
What shall you ask of methat I'll deny,

1678
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:27.170
That honour saved may uponasking give?

1679
01:25:27.170 --> 01:25:29.930
Nothing but this; yourtrue love for my master.

1680
01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:31.830
How with mine honour may Igive him that

1681
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:33.200
Which I have given to you?

1682
01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:36.230
I will acquit you.

1683
01:25:36.230 --> 01:25:39.530
Well, come againto-morrow: fare thee well:

1684
01:25:39.530 --> 01:25:43.500
A fiend like thee mightbear my soul to hell.

1685
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:50.770
Gentleman, God save thee.

1686
01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:51.730
And you, sir.

1687
01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:54.530
That defence thou hast,betake thee to't:

1688
01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:57.370
of what nature the wrongs arethou hast done him, I know not;

1689
01:25:57.370 --> 01:26:00.370
but thy intercepter,full of despite,

1690
01:26:00.370 --> 01:26:03.400
bloody as the hunter, attendsthee at the orchard-end:

1691
01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:07.030
dismount thy tuck, beyare in thy preparation,

1692
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:09.600
for thy assailant is quick,skilful and deadly.

1693
01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:13.170
You mistake, sir; I am sure noman hath any quarrel to me:

1694
01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:14.330
my remembrance is very free

1695
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:17.000
and clear from any image ofoffence done to any man.

1696
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.870
You'll find it otherwise,I assure you:

1697
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:20.230
therefore, if you holdyour life at any price,

1698
01:26:20.230 --> 01:26:23.370
betake you to your guard; foryour opposite hath in him

1699
01:26:23.370 --> 01:26:27.130
what youth, strength, skill andwrath can furnish man withal.

1700
01:26:27.130 --> 01:26:28.470
I pray you, sir, what ishe?

1701
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:32.330
He is knight, dubbedwith unhatched rapier

1702
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:37.230
and on carpet consideration; buthe is a devil in private brawl:

1703
01:26:37.230 --> 01:26:39.600
souls and bodies hathhe divorced three;

1704
01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:42.100
and his incensement at thismoment is so implacable,

1705
01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:44.330
that satisfaction can be none

1706
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:46.700
but by pangs of deathand sepulchre.

1707
01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:51.700
Hob, nob, is his word;give't or take't.

1708
01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:52.930
I will return againinto the house

1709
01:26:52.930 --> 01:26:56.900
and desire some conduct ofthe lady. I am no fighter.

1710
01:26:58.970 --> 01:27:00.600
I have heard ofsome kind of men

1711
01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:04.170
that put quarrels purposely onothers, to taste their valour:

1712
01:27:04.170 --> 01:27:06.430
belike this is aman of that quirk.

1713
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:07.700
Sir, no;

1714
01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:09.870
his indignation derives itselfout of a very competent injury:

1715
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:12.870
therefore, get you on andgive him his desire.

1716
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:14.270
Back you shall notto the house,

1717
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:16.330
unless you undertakethat with me

1718
01:27:16.330 --> 01:27:19.630
which with as much safetyyou might answer him:

1719
01:27:19.630 --> 01:27:23.300
therefore, on, or stripyour sword stark naked;

1720
01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:24.730
for meddle you must,that's certain,

1721
01:27:24.730 --> 01:27:27.130
or forswear to weariron about you.

1722
01:27:27.130 --> 01:27:30.770
This is as uncivil asstrange. I beseech you,

1723
01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:33.100
do me this courteous office,as to know of the knight

1724
01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:35.430
what my offence to him is:it is something of my

1725
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:38.970
negligence, nothing of mypurpose.

1726
01:27:38.970 --> 01:27:44.100
I will do so.

1727
01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:51.230
Signior Fabian, stay you bythis gentleman till my return.

1728
01:28:05.170 --> 01:28:09.300
Pray you, sir, do you knowof this matter?

1729
01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:13.500
I know the knight isincensed against you,

1730
01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:14.830
even to a mortal arbitrement;

1731
01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:18.030
but nothing of thecircumstance more.

1732
01:28:18.030 --> 01:28:22.630
I beseech you, whatmanner of man is he?

1733
01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:24.670
Nothing of thatwonderful promise,

1734
01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:25.870
to read him by his form,

1735
01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:29.430
as you are like to find himin the proof of his valour.

1736
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:31.300
He is, indeed, sir,the most skilful,

1737
01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:34.330
bloody and fatal oppositethat you could possibly

1738
01:28:34.330 --> 01:28:37.600
have found in anypart of Illyria.

1739
01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.100
Will you walk towards him?

1740
01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:40.830
I will make your peacewith him if I can.

1741
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:43.030
I shall be muchbound to you for't:

1742
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:46.270
I am one that had rather go withsir priest than sir knight:

1743
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:49.500
I care not who knowsso much of my mettle.

1744
01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:53.100
Why, man, he's a very devil;

1745
01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:54.270
I have not seen such a firago.

1746
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:56.330
I had a pass with him,rapier, scabbard and all,

1747
01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:58.800
and he gives me the stuck inwith such a mortal motion,

1748
01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.230
that it is inevitable;and on the answer,

1749
01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:04.070
he pays you as surely asyour feet hit the ground

1750
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:05.530
they step on.

1751
01:29:05.530 --> 01:29:07.870
They say he has beenfencer to the Sophy.

1752
01:29:07.870 --> 01:29:09.170
Pox on't, I'll not meddlewith him.

1753
01:29:09.170 --> 01:29:11.330
Ay, but he will notnow be pacified:

1754
01:29:11.330 --> 01:29:13.230
Fabian can scarcehold him yonder.

1755
01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:14.600
Plague on't, an I thoughthe had been valiant

1756
01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:15.870
and so cunning in fence,

1757
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:17.600
I'ld have seen him damned ereI'ld have challenged him.

1758
01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.830
Let him let the matter slip,

1759
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:21.400
and I'll give him myhorse, grey Capilet.

1760
01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:28.570
I'll make the motion:

1761
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:36.370
stand here, make agood show on't:

1762
01:29:36.370 --> 01:29:39.230
this shall end withoutthe perdition of souls.

1763
01:29:39.230 --> 01:29:41.700
Marry, I'll ride your horseas well as I ride you.

1764
01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:44.130
I have his horse to takeup the quarrel:

1765
01:29:44.130 --> 01:29:47.100
I have persuaded him theyouth's a devil.

1766
01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:48.300
He is as horriblyconceited of him;

1767
01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:51.430
and pants and looks pale, asif a bear were at his heels.

1768
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:53.330
There's no remedy, sir;

1769
01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:55.170
he will fight withyou for's oath sake:

1770
01:29:55.170 --> 01:29:56.930
marry, he hath betterbethought him of his quarrel,

1771
01:29:56.930 --> 01:30:00.800
and he finds that now scarceto be worth talking of:

1772
01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:04.330
therefore draw, for thesupportance of his vow;

1773
01:30:04.330 --> 01:30:06.930
he protests he willnot hurt you.

1774
01:30:06.930 --> 01:30:09.930
Pray God defend me! Alittle thing would

1775
01:30:09.930 --> 01:30:12.330
make me tell them how muchI lack of a man.

1776
01:30:12.330 --> 01:30:16.200
Give ground, if you seehim furious.

1777
01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.200
Come, Sir Andrew,there's no remedy;

1778
01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:19.370
the gentleman will,

1779
01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:21.430
for his honour's sake,have one bout with you;

1780
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:23.430
he cannot by theduello avoid it:

1781
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:25.500
but he has promised me, as heis a gentleman and a soldier,

1782
01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:29.500
he will not hurtyou. Come on; to't.

1783
01:30:29.730 --> 01:30:31.830
Pray God, he keep hisoath!

1784
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:36.200
I do assure you, 'tisagainst my will.

1785
01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:04.130
Put up your sword. If thisyoung gentleman

1786
01:31:04.130 --> 01:31:06.330
Have done offence, I takethe fault on me:

1787
01:31:06.330 --> 01:31:08.270
If you offend him, I forhim defy you.

1788
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:10.200
You, sir! why, what areyou?

1789
01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:12.000
One, sir, that for hislove dares yet do more

1790
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.970
Than you have heard himbrag to you he will.

1791
01:31:13.970 --> 01:31:18.900
Nay, if you be anundertaker, I am for you.

1792
01:31:27.670 --> 01:31:30.430
O good Sir Toby, hold!here come the officers.

1793
01:31:30.430 --> 01:31:33.030
I'll be with you anon.

1794
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:34.930
Pray, sir, put your swordup, if you please.

1795
01:31:34.930 --> 01:31:36.670
Marry, will I, sir; and,for that I promised you,

1796
01:31:36.670 --> 01:31:37.930
I'll be as good as my word:

1797
01:31:37.930 --> 01:31:39.170
he will bear you easilyand reins well.

1798
01:31:39.170 --> 01:31:44.530
This is the man; do thyoffice.

1799
01:31:44.530 --> 01:31:47.230
Antonio, I arrest thee atthe suit of Count Orsino.

1800
01:31:47.230 --> 01:31:48.300
You do mistake me, sir.

1801
01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:50.400
No, sir, no jot; I knowyour favour well,

1802
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.430
Though now you have nosea-cap on your head.

1803
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:54.570
Take him away: he knows Iknow him well.

1804
01:31:54.570 --> 01:31:58.830
I must obey.

1805
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:03.070
This comes with seekingyou:

1806
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:06.030
But there's no remedy; Ishall answer it.

1807
01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:06.970
What will you do, now mynecessity

1808
01:32:06.970 --> 01:32:09.300
Makes me to askyou for my purse?

1809
01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:11.730
It grieves me Much more forwhat I cannot do for you

1810
01:32:11.730 --> 01:32:14.530
Than what befalls myself.You stand amazed;

1811
01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:17.030
But be of comfort.

1812
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:21.200
Come, sir, away.

1813
01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:24.000
I must entreat of you someof that money.

1814
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.300
What money, sir?

1815
01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:28.330
For the fair kindness youhave show'd me here,

1816
01:32:28.330 --> 01:32:30.700
And, part, being promptedby your present trouble,

1817
01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:32.200
Out of my lean and lowability

1818
01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:34.300
I'll lend you something:my having is not much;

1819
01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:37.130
I'll make division of mypresent with you:

1820
01:32:37.130 --> 01:32:40.370
Hold, there's half mycoffer.

1821
01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:42.570
Will you deny me now?

1822
01:32:42.570 --> 01:32:43.870
Is't possible that mydeserts to you

1823
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:46.700
Can lack persuasion? Donot tempt my misery,

1824
01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:48.000
Lest that it make me sounsound a man

1825
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.670
As to upbraid you withthose kindnesses

1826
01:32:49.670 --> 01:32:50.770
That I have done for you.

1827
01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:52.100
I know of none;

1828
01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:55.230
Nor know I you by voice orany feature:

1829
01:32:55.230 --> 01:32:56.870
I hate ingratitude more ina man

1830
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:59.400
Than lying, vainness,babbling, drunkenness,

1831
01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.630
Or any taint of vice whosestrong corruption

1832
01:33:01.630 --> 01:33:04.100
Inhabits our frail blood.

1833
01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:06.670
O heavens themselves!

1834
01:33:06.670 --> 01:33:08.130
Come, sir, I pray you, go.

1835
01:33:08.130 --> 01:33:11.300
Let me speak a little. Thisyouth that you see here

1836
01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:13.930
I snatch'd one half out ofthe jaws of death,

1837
01:33:13.930 --> 01:33:16.970
Relieved him with suchsanctity of love,

1838
01:33:16.970 --> 01:33:18.700
And to his image, whichmethought did promise

1839
01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:22.830
Most venerable worth, didI devotion.

1840
01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:25.330
What's that to us? Thetime goes by: away!

1841
01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:28.970
But O how vile an idolproves this god

1842
01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:33.500
Thou hast, Sebastian, donegood feature shame.

1843
01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.900
In nature there's noblemish but the mind;

1844
01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:39.700
None can be call'ddeform'd but the unkind:

1845
01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:43.000
Virtue is beauty, but thebeauteous evil

1846
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.770
Are empty trunkso'erflourish'd by the devil.

1847
01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:48.030
The man grows mad: awaywith him! Come, come, sir.

1848
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:51.830
Lead me on.

1849
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:54.530
Methinks his words do fromsuch passion fly,

1850
01:33:54.530 --> 01:33:57.630
That he believes himself:so do not I.

1851
01:33:57.630 --> 01:34:01.330
Prove true, imagination,O, prove true,

1852
01:34:01.330 --> 01:34:04.170
That I, dear brother,be now ta'en for you!

1853
01:34:04.170 --> 01:34:06.070
Come hither, knight;come hither, Fabian:

1854
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:10.070
He named Sebastian: I mybrother know

1855
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:13.000
Yet living in my glass;even such and so

1856
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.900
In favour was my brother,and he went

1857
01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:16.470
Still in this fashion,colour, ornament,

1858
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:21.400
For him I imitate: O, ifit prove,

1859
01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:27.830
Tempests are kind and saltwaves fresh in love.

1860
01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:33.770
A very dishonest paltry boy,

1861
01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:35.330
and more a coward than a hare:

1862
01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:36.570
his dishonesty appearsin leaving his

1863
01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:38.730
friend here in necessityand denying him;

1864
01:34:38.730 --> 01:34:40.800
and for his cowardship,ask Fabian.

1865
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:44.530
A coward, a most devoutcoward, religious in it.

1866
01:34:44.530 --> 01:34:46.530
'Slid, I'll after himagain and beat him.

1867
01:34:46.530 --> 01:34:50.330
Do; cuff him soundly, butnever draw thy sword.

1868
01:34:50.330 --> 01:34:51.500
An I do not,--

1869
01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:52.530
Come, let's see the event.

1870
01:34:52.530 --> 01:34:59.830
I dare lay any money'twill be nothing yet.

1871
01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:04.300
Will you make me believethat I am not sent for you?

1872
01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:06.670
Go to, go to, thou art afoolish fellow:

1873
01:35:06.670 --> 01:35:09.470
Let me be clear of thee.

1874
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:14.270
Well held out, i' faith!No, I do not know you;

1875
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:16.200
nor I am not sentto you by my lady,

1876
01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:18.500
to bid you comespeak with her;

1877
01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:20.800
nor your name is notMaster Cesario;

1878
01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.930
nor this is notmy nose neither.

1879
01:35:22.930 --> 01:35:24.770
Nothing that is so is so.

1880
01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:26.530
I prithee, vent thyfolly somewhere else:

1881
01:35:26.530 --> 01:35:28.030
Thou know'st not me.

1882
01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:29.970
Vent my folly! hehas heard that word

1883
01:35:29.970 --> 01:35:32.600
of some great man and nowapplies it to a fool.

1884
01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:35.470
Vent my folly! I am afraidthis great lubber, the world,

1885
01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:38.830
will prove a cockney.I prithee now,

1886
01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:41.500
ungird thy strangeness

1887
01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:44.230
and tell me what Ishall vent to my lady:

1888
01:35:44.230 --> 01:35:45.630
shall I vent to herthat thou art coming?

1889
01:35:45.630 --> 01:35:46.870
I prithee, foolishGreek, depart from me:

1890
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:49.430
There's money for thee:if you tarry longer,

1891
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:50.670
I shall give worse payment.

1892
01:35:50.670 --> 01:35:52.830
By my troth, thou hast anopen hand. These wise men

1893
01:35:52.830 --> 01:35:55.000
that give fools money getthemselves a good report--

1894
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.570
after fourteen years' purchase.

1895
01:35:56.570 --> 01:36:04.830
Now, sir, have I met youagain? there's for you.

1896
01:36:04.830 --> 01:36:07.570
Why, there's for thee,and there, and there.

1897
01:36:07.570 --> 01:36:09.000
Are all the people mad?

1898
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.570
Hold, sir, or I'll throwyour dagger o'er the house.

1899
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:13.070
This will I tellmy lady straight:

1900
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:15.130
I would not be in some ofyour coats for two pence.

1901
01:36:15.130 --> 01:36:16.400
Come on, sir; hold.

1902
01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:17.870
Nay, let him alone: I'll goanother way to work with him;

1903
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:19.470
I'll have an action ofbattery against him,

1904
01:36:19.470 --> 01:36:20.800
if there be any law in Illyria:

1905
01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:22.270
though I struck him first,yet it's no matter for that.

1906
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:23.500
Let go thy hand.

1907
01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:25.870
Come, sir, I will not let yougo. Come, my young soldier,

1908
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:29.630
put up your iron: you arewell fleshed; come on.

1909
01:36:29.630 --> 01:36:34.370
I will be free from thee.What wouldst thou now?

1910
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:36.770
If thou darest tempt mefurther, draw thy sword.

1911
01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:39.030
What, what? Nay, then Imust have an ounce or two

1912
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:44.070
of this malapert bloodfrom you.

1913
01:37:06.170 --> 01:37:08.500
Hold, Toby; on thy life Icharge thee, hold!

1914
01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:09.970
Madam!

1915
01:37:09.970 --> 01:37:11.770
Will it be ever thus?Ungracious wretch,

1916
01:37:11.770 --> 01:37:13.630
Fit for the mountains andthe barbarous caves,

1917
01:37:13.630 --> 01:37:16.200
Where manners ne'er werepreach'd! out of my sight!

1918
01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:18.700
Be not offended, dearCesario.

1919
01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:21.900
Rudesby, be gone!

1920
01:37:31.730 --> 01:37:32.670
I prithee, gentle friend,

1921
01:37:32.670 --> 01:37:34.370
Let thy fair wisdom, notthy passion, sway

1922
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:36.400
In this uncivil and thouunjust extent

1923
01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:38.870
Against thy peace. Go withme to my house,

1924
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:41.300
And hear thou there howmany fruitless pranks

1925
01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:44.030
This ruffian hath botch'dup, that thou thereby

1926
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:46.770
Mayst smile at this: thoushalt not choose but go:

1927
01:37:46.770 --> 01:37:51.000
Do not deny. Beshrew hissoul for me,

1928
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.730
He started one poor heartof mine in thee.

1929
01:37:53.730 --> 01:37:58.030
What relish is in this?how runs the stream?

1930
01:37:58.030 --> 01:38:01.870
Or I am mad, or else thisis a dream:

1931
01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:06.100
Let fancy still my sensein Lethe steep;

1932
01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:11.570
If it be thus to dream,still let me sleep!

1933
01:38:11.570 --> 01:38:15.670
Nay, come, I prithee; wouldthou'ldst be ruled by me!

1934
01:38:15.670 --> 01:38:17.530
Madam, I will.

1935
01:38:17.530 --> 01:38:23.200
O, say so, and so be!

1936
01:38:32.370 --> 01:38:39.800
Nay, I prithee, put onthis gown and this beard;

1937
01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:43.700
make him believe thou artSir Topas the curate:

1938
01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:47.700
do it quickly; I'll callSir Toby the whilst.

1939
01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:52.000
Well, I'll put it on, and Iwill dissemble myself in't;

1940
01:38:52.230 --> 01:38:53.730
and I would I werethe first that ever

1941
01:38:53.730 --> 01:38:58.330
dissembled in such a gown.The competitors enter.

1942
01:38:58.330 --> 01:39:00.970
Jove bless thee, masterParson.

1943
01:39:00.970 --> 01:39:04.370
Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for, asthe old hermit of Prague,

1944
01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:06.200
that never saw pen and ink,

1945
01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:08.800
very wittily said to aniece of King Gorboduc,

1946
01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:09.970
'That that is is;'

1947
01:39:09.970 --> 01:39:15.800
so I, being Master Parson,am Master Parson;

1948
01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:18.170
for, what is 'that' but'that,' and 'is' but 'is'?

1949
01:39:18.170 --> 01:39:21.430
To him, Sir Topas.

1950
01:39:26.970 --> 01:39:31.770
What, ho, I say! peace inthis prison!

1951
01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:33.730
The knave counterfeitswell; a good knave.

1952
01:39:33.730 --> 01:39:35.000
Who calls there?

1953
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.170
Sir Topas the curate, who comesto visit Malvolio the lunatic.

1954
01:39:39.170 --> 01:39:43.430
Sir Topas, Sir Topas, goodSir Topas, go to my lady.

1955
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:48.030
Out, hyperbolical fiend!how vexest thou this man!

1956
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:50.330
talkest thou nothing butof ladies?

1957
01:39:50.330 --> 01:39:52.300
Well said, Master Parson.

1958
01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:54.600
Sir Topas, never wasman thus wronged:

1959
01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:57.200
good Sir Topas, donot think I am mad:

1960
01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.670
they have laid me herein hideous darkness.

1961
01:39:59.670 --> 01:40:03.530
Fie, thou dishonest Satan!I call thee by the most

1962
01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:06.700
modest terms; for I am oneof those gentle ones

1963
01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:09.170
that will use the devilhimself with courtesy:

1964
01:40:09.170 --> 01:40:11.130
sayest thou that house isdark?

1965
01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:13.100
As hell, Sir Topas.

1966
01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:17.670
Why it hath bay windowstransparent as barricadoes,

1967
01:40:17.670 --> 01:40:19.570
and the clearstorestoward the south north

1968
01:40:19.570 --> 01:40:21.300
are as lustrous as ebony;

1969
01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:24.170
and yet complainestthou of obstruction?

1970
01:40:24.170 --> 01:40:28.300
I am not mad, Sir Topas: I sayto you, this house is dark.

1971
01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:30.170
Madman, thou errest:

1972
01:40:30.170 --> 01:40:33.900
I say, there is nodarkness but ignorance;

1973
01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:35.470
Fare thee well.

1974
01:40:35.470 --> 01:40:38.800
Sir Topas, Sir Topas!

1975
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:43.030
My most exquisite SirTopas!

1976
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:44.500
Nay, I am for all waters.

1977
01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:46.530
Thou mightst have done thiswithout thy beard and gown:

1978
01:40:46.530 --> 01:40:48.370
he sees thee not.

1979
01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.500
To him in thine own voice,and bring me word how

1980
01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:54.570
thou findest him: I would wewere well rid of this knavery.

1981
01:40:54.570 --> 01:40:56.730
If he may be convenientlydelivered, I would he were,

1982
01:40:56.730 --> 01:40:59.770
for I am now so far inoffence with my niece

1983
01:40:59.770 --> 01:41:02.770
that I cannot pursuewith any safety

1984
01:41:02.770 --> 01:41:12.300
this sport to the upshot. Comeby and by to my chamber.

1985
01:41:19.330 --> 01:41:20.900
[Singing]

1986
01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:22.370
'Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,

1987
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:23.500
Tell me how thy ladydoes.'

1988
01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:24.570
Fool!

1989
01:41:24.570 --> 01:41:26.330
'My lady is unkind,perdy.'

1990
01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:27.330
Fool!

1991
01:41:27.330 --> 01:41:28.700
'Alas, why is she so?'

1992
01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:30.400
Fool, I say!

1993
01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:32.770
'She loves another'--Whocalls, ha?

1994
01:41:32.770 --> 01:41:36.900
Good fool, as ever thou wiltdeserve well at my hand,

1995
01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:38.900
help me to a candle, andpen, ink and paper:

1996
01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:45.600
as I am a gentleman, I will liveto be thankful to thee for't.

1997
01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:46.600
Master Malvolio?

1998
01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.930
Ay, good fool.

1999
01:41:48.930 --> 01:41:50.870
Alas, sir, how fell youbesides your five wits?

2000
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:53.300
Fool, there was never a manso notoriously abused:

2001
01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:55.630
I am as well in my wits,fool, as thou art.

2002
01:41:55.630 --> 01:41:57.200
But as well? thenyou are mad indeed,

2003
01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:59.870
if you be no better inyour wits than a fool.

2004
01:41:59.870 --> 01:42:02.630
They have here propertiedme; keep me in darkness,

2005
01:42:02.630 --> 01:42:05.730
send ministers to me,asses, and do all they can

2006
01:42:05.730 --> 01:42:07.500
to face me out of my wits.

2007
01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:10.530
Advise you what you say;the minister is here.

2008
01:42:10.530 --> 01:42:13.770
Malvolio, Malvolio, thywits the heavens restore!

2009
01:42:13.770 --> 01:42:17.700
endeavour thyself to sleep, andleave thy vain bibble babble.

2010
01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:18.830
Sir Topas!

2011
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:21.430
Maintain no words withhim, good fellow.

2012
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:24.070
Who, I, sir? not I, sir. Godbe wi' you, good Sir Topas.

2013
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:26.870
Merry, amen. I will, sir,I will.

2014
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:28.870
Good fool,some ink, paper and light;

2015
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:31.000
and convey what I willset down to my lady:

2016
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.870
it shall advantage thee more

2017
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:36.870
than ever the bearingof letter did.

2018
01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:48.800
I will help you to't.But tell me true,

2019
01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:51.000
are you not mad indeed? ordo you but counterfeit?

2020
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.600
Believe me, I am not; Itell thee true.

2021
01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:58.800
Nay, I'll ne'er believe amadman till I see his brains.

2022
01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.430
I will fetch you lightand paper and ink.

2023
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:03.600
Fool, I'll requite itin the highest degree:

2024
01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:04.770
I prithee, be gone.

2025
01:43:04.770 --> 01:43:05.570
[Singing]

2026
01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:06.570
I am gone, sir,

2027
01:43:06.570 --> 01:43:07.300
And anon, sir,

2028
01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:09.370
I'll be with you again,

2029
01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:10.000
In a trice,

2030
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.030
Like to the old Vice,

2031
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:13.200
Your need to sustain;

2032
01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.170
Who, with dagger of lath,

2033
01:43:14.170 --> 01:43:15.530
In his rage and his wrath,

2034
01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:16.700
Cries, ah, ha! to thedevil:

2035
01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:18.970
Like a mad lad,

2036
01:43:18.970 --> 01:43:20.500
Pare thy nails, dad;

2037
01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:24.000
Adieu, good man devil.

2038
01:43:30.930 --> 01:43:37.870


2039
01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:49.700
This is the air; that isthe glorious sun;

2040
01:43:50.630 --> 01:43:55.530
This pearl she gave me, Ido feel't and see't;

2041
01:43:55.530 --> 01:43:58.270
And though 'tis wonderthat enwraps me thus,

2042
01:43:58.270 --> 01:44:03.700
Yet 'tis not madness.Where's Antonio, then?

2043
01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:04.930
I could not find him atthe Elephant:

2044
01:44:04.930 --> 01:44:08.000
Yet there he was; andthere I found this credit,

2045
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.470
That he did range the townto seek me out.

2046
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:14.170
His counsel now might dome golden service;

2047
01:44:14.170 --> 01:44:16.870
For though my soul disputeswell with my sense,

2048
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:21.500
That this may be someerror, but no madness,

2049
01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.930
Yet doth this accident andflood of fortune

2050
01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:27.870
So far exceed allinstance, all discourse,

2051
01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:29.400
That I am ready todistrust mine eyes

2052
01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:32.500
And wrangle with my reasonthat persuades me

2053
01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:37.370
To any other trust butthat I am mad

2054
01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:42.430
Or else the lady's mad;yet, if 'twere so,

2055
01:44:42.430 --> 01:44:45.530
She could not sway her house,command her followers,

2056
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:47.500
Take and give back affairsand their dispatch

2057
01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:50.930
With such a smooth,discreet and stable bearing

2058
01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:54.170
As I perceive she does:there's something in't

2059
01:44:54.170 --> 01:44:58.230
That is deceiveable. Buthere the lady comes.

2060
01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:06.070
Blame not this haste ofmine. If you mean well,

2061
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:07.870
Now go with me and withthis holy man

2062
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:10.600
Into the chantry by:there, before him,

2063
01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:13.700
And underneath thatconsecrated roof,

2064
01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:16.000
Plight me the fullassurance of your faith;

2065
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.670
That my most jealous andtoo doubtful soul

2066
01:45:18.670 --> 01:45:22.000
May live at peace. Heshall conceal it

2067
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.330
Whiles you are willing itshall come to note,

2068
01:45:24.330 --> 01:45:25.700
What time we will ourcelebration keep

2069
01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:28.270
According to my birth.What do you say?

2070
01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:31.330
I'll follow this good man,and go with you;

2071
01:45:31.330 --> 01:45:35.670
And, having sworn truth,ever will be true.

2072
01:45:35.670 --> 01:45:43.700
Then lead the way, goodfather; and heavens so shine,

2073
01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:47.970
That they may fairly notethis act of mine!

2074
01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:02.700
Now, as thou lovest me,let me see his letter.

2075
01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:05.300
Good Master Fabian, grantme another request.

2076
01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:06.370
Any thing.

2077
01:46:06.370 --> 01:46:09.170
Do not desire to see thisletter.

2078
01:46:09.170 --> 01:46:10.370
This is, to give a dog,

2079
01:46:10.370 --> 01:46:13.670
and in recompensedesire my dog again.

2080
01:46:14.170 --> 01:46:16.170
Belong you to the LadyOlivia, friends?

2081
01:46:16.170 --> 01:46:19.130
Ay, sir; we are some ofher trappings.

2082
01:46:19.130 --> 01:46:21.470
I know thee well; how dostthou, my good fellow?

2083
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:22.800
Truly, sir,

2084
01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:25.930
the better for my foes andthe worse for my friends.

2085
01:46:25.930 --> 01:46:27.670
Just the contrary; thebetter for thy friends.

2086
01:46:27.670 --> 01:46:28.630
No, sir, the worse.

2087
01:46:28.630 --> 01:46:29.830
How can that be?

2088
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:32.430
Marry, sir, they praise meand make an ass of me;

2089
01:46:32.430 --> 01:46:35.130
now my foes tell meplainly I am an ass:

2090
01:46:35.130 --> 01:46:38.930
so that by my foes, sir I profitin the knowledge of myself,

2091
01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:41.300
and by my friends, I am abused:

2092
01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:42.400
if you will let your lady know

2093
01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.030
I am here to speak with her,

2094
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:45.470
and bring her along with you,

2095
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:46.730
it may awake mybounty.

2096
01:46:46.730 --> 01:46:49.130
O, lullaby to yourbounty till I come again.

2097
01:46:49.130 --> 01:46:50.900
I will awake it soon.

2098
01:46:53.230 --> 01:46:55.570
Here comes the man, sir,that did rescue me.

2099
01:46:55.570 --> 01:46:59.570
That face of his I doremember well;

2100
01:46:59.570 --> 01:47:01.400
Yet, when I saw it last,it was besmear'd

2101
01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:04.700
As black as Vulcan in thesmoke of war:

2102
01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:07.100
A bawbling vessel was hecaptain of,

2103
01:47:07.100 --> 01:47:10.400
For shallow draught andbulk unprizable;

2104
01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:12.170
With which such scathfulgrapple did he make

2105
01:47:12.170 --> 01:47:14.100
With the most noble bottomof our fleet,

2106
01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:15.930
That very envy and thetongue of loss

2107
01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:19.630
Cried fame and honour onhim. What's the matter?

2108
01:47:19.630 --> 01:47:22.030
Orsino, this is thatAntonio

2109
01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:24.470
That took the Phoenix andher fraught from Candy;

2110
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:26.370
And this is he that didthe Tiger board,

2111
01:47:26.370 --> 01:47:28.570
When your young nephewTitus lost his leg:

2112
01:47:28.570 --> 01:47:30.400
Here in the streets,desperate of shame and state,

2113
01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:32.730
In private brabble did weapprehend him.

2114
01:47:32.730 --> 01:47:34.570
He did me kindness, sir,drew on my side;

2115
01:47:34.570 --> 01:47:37.500
But in conclusion putstrange speech upon me:

2116
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.470
I know not what 'twas butdistraction.

2117
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:42.770
Notable pirate! thousalt-water thief!

2118
01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:45.500
What foolish boldness broughtthee to their mercies,

2119
01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:47.770
Whom thou, in terms sobloody and so dear,

2120
01:47:47.770 --> 01:47:50.670
Hast made thine enemies?

2121
01:47:51.630 --> 01:47:53.430
Orsino, noble sir,

2122
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:57.030
Be pleased that I shake offthese names you give me:

2123
01:47:57.030 --> 01:48:00.330
Antonio never yet wasthief or pirate,

2124
01:48:00.330 --> 01:48:01.930
Though I confess, on baseand ground enough,

2125
01:48:01.930 --> 01:48:07.500
Orsino's enemy. Awitchcraft drew me hither:

2126
01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:09.330
That most ingrateful boythere by your side,

2127
01:48:09.330 --> 01:48:11.670
From the rude sea'senraged and foamy mouth

2128
01:48:11.670 --> 01:48:16.030
Did I redeem; a wreck pasthope he was:

2129
01:48:16.030 --> 01:48:17.600
His life I gave him anddid thereto add

2130
01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:19.730
My love, without retentionor restraint,

2131
01:48:19.730 --> 01:48:23.730
All his in dedication; forhis sake

2132
01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:26.030
Did I expose myself, purefor his love,

2133
01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:29.100
Into the danger of thisadverse town;

2134
01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:31.330
Drew to defend him when hewas beset:

2135
01:48:31.330 --> 01:48:33.070
Where being apprehended,his false cunning,

2136
01:48:33.070 --> 01:48:35.230
Not meaning to partakewith me in danger,

2137
01:48:35.230 --> 01:48:37.500
Taught him to face me outof his acquaintance,

2138
01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:39.430
And grew a twenty yearsremoved thing

2139
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:44.700
While one would wink;denied me mine own purse,

2140
01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:46.500
Which I had recommended tohis use

2141
01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:47.500
Not half an hour before.

2142
01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:48.800
How can this be?

2143
01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:49.970
When came he to this town?

2144
01:48:49.970 --> 01:48:51.730
To-day, my lord; and forthree months before,

2145
01:48:51.730 --> 01:48:53.730
No interim, not a minute'svacancy,

2146
01:48:53.730 --> 01:48:58.070
Both day and night did wekeep company.

2147
01:48:58.070 --> 01:49:02.170
Here comes the countess:now heaven walks on earth.

2148
01:49:02.170 --> 01:49:04.530
But for thee, fellow; fellow,thy words are madness:

2149
01:49:04.530 --> 01:49:08.300
Three months this youthhath tended upon me;

2150
01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:10.870
But more of that anon.Take him aside.

2151
01:49:15.230 --> 01:49:17.270
What would my lord, butthat he may not have,

2152
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:19.170
Wherein Olivia may seemserviceable?

2153
01:49:19.170 --> 01:49:21.470
Cesario, you do not keeppromise with me.

2154
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:22.500
Madam!

2155
01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:23.430
Gracious Olivia,--

2156
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:24.630
What do you say, Cesario?Good my lord,--

2157
01:49:24.630 --> 01:49:29.030
My lord would speak; myduty hushes me.

2158
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:30.470
If it be aught to the oldtune, my lord,

2159
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:32.730
It is as fat and fulsometo mine ear

2160
01:49:32.730 --> 01:49:36.500
As howling after music.

2161
01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:38.470
Still so cruel?

2162
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:40.770
Still so constant, lord.

2163
01:49:40.770 --> 01:49:45.470
What, to perverseness? youuncivil lady,

2164
01:49:45.470 --> 01:49:47.130
To whose ingrate andunauspicious altars

2165
01:49:47.130 --> 01:49:49.430
My soul the faithfull'stofferings hath breathed out

2166
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:54.400
That e'er devotiontender'd! What shall I do?

2167
01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.770
Even what it please my lord,that shall become him.

2168
01:49:56.770 --> 01:49:59.470
Why should I not, had Ithe heart to do it,

2169
01:49:59.470 --> 01:50:01.230
Like to the Egyptian thiefat point of death,

2170
01:50:01.230 --> 01:50:03.670
Kill what I love?--asavage jealousy

2171
01:50:03.670 --> 01:50:06.600
That sometimes savoursnobly. But hear me this:

2172
01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:09.670
Since you to non-regardancecast my faith,

2173
01:50:09.670 --> 01:50:11.270
And that I partly know theinstrument

2174
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:14.100
That screws me from mytrue place in your favour,

2175
01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:17.600
Live you the marble-breastedtyrant still;

2176
01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:20.730
But this your minion, whomI know you love,

2177
01:50:20.730 --> 01:50:23.200
And whom, by heaven Iswear, I tender dearly,

2178
01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:25.170
Him will I tear out ofthat cruel eye,

2179
01:50:25.170 --> 01:50:27.730
Where he sits crowned inhis master's spite.

2180
01:50:27.730 --> 01:50:31.330
Come, boy, with me; mythoughts are ripe in mischief:

2181
01:50:31.330 --> 01:50:32.930
I'll sacrifice the lambthat I do love,

2182
01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:34.800
To spite a raven's heartwithin a dove.

2183
01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:36.570
And I, most jocund, aptand willingly,

2184
01:50:36.570 --> 01:50:39.070
To do you rest, a thousanddeaths would die.

2185
01:50:39.070 --> 01:50:40.200
Where goes Cesario?

2186
01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:42.130
After him I love

2187
01:50:42.130 --> 01:50:45.570
More than I love theseeyes, more than my life,

2188
01:50:45.570 --> 01:50:48.400
More, by all mores, thane'er I shall love wife.

2189
01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:50.600
If I do feign, youwitnesses above

2190
01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:54.070
Punish my life fortainting of my love!

2191
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:58.300
Ay me, detested! how am Ibeguiled!

2192
01:50:58.300 --> 01:51:00.400
Who does beguile you? whodoes do you wrong?

2193
01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:03.630
Hast thou forgot thyself?is it so long?

2194
01:51:03.630 --> 01:51:05.830
Call forth the holyfather.

2195
01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:06.770
Come, away!

2196
01:51:06.770 --> 01:51:12.600
Whither, my lord? Cesario,husband, stay.

2197
01:51:21.330 --> 01:51:22.300
Husband!

2198
01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:24.400
Ay, husband: can he thatdeny?

2199
01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:26.130
Her husband, sirrah!

2200
01:51:26.130 --> 01:51:28.170
No, my lord, not I.

2201
01:51:28.170 --> 01:51:30.100
Alas, it is the basenessof thy fear

2202
01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:33.170
That makes thee stranglethy propriety:

2203
01:51:33.170 --> 01:51:35.900
Fear not, Cesario; takethy fortunes up;

2204
01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:38.000
Be that thou know'st thouart, and then thou art

2205
01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:42.770
As great as that thoufear'st.

2206
01:51:42.770 --> 01:51:45.300
O, welcome, father!

2207
01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:47.200
Father, I charge thee, bythy reverence,

2208
01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.270
Here to unfold, thoughlately we intended

2209
01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:51.200
To keep in darkness whatoccasion now

2210
01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:53.600
Reveals before 'tis ripe,what thou dost know

2211
01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:59.130
Hath newly pass'd betweenthis youth and me.

2212
01:51:59.130 --> 01:52:02.670
A contract of eternal bondof love,

2213
01:52:02.670 --> 01:52:05.100
Confirm'd by mutualjoinder of your hands,

2214
01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:07.170
Attested by the holy closeof lips,

2215
01:52:07.170 --> 01:52:10.170
Strengthen'd byinterchangement of your rings;

2216
01:52:10.170 --> 01:52:12.570
And all the ceremony ofthis compact

2217
01:52:12.570 --> 01:52:17.230
Seal'd in my function, bymy testimony:

2218
01:52:17.230 --> 01:52:21.200
Since when, my watch hathtold me, toward my grave

2219
01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:24.400
I have travell'd but twohours.

2220
01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:30.000
O thou dissembling cub!what wilt thou be

2221
01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.830
When time hath sow'd agrizzle on thy case?

2222
01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:34.870
Or will not else thy craftso quickly grow,

2223
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:37.830
That thine own trip shallbe thine overthrow?

2224
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:41.470
Farewell, and take her;but direct thy feet

2225
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:43.530
Where thou and Ihenceforth may never meet.

2226
01:52:43.530 --> 01:52:45.000
My lord, I do protest--

2227
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.070
O, do not swear!

2228
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:48.830
Hold little faith, thoughthou hast too much fear.

2229
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:51.870
For the love of God, a surgeon!

2230
01:52:51.870 --> 01:52:53.670
Send one presently to Sir Toby.

2231
01:52:53.670 --> 01:52:54.770
What's the matter?

2232
01:52:54.770 --> 01:52:56.230
He has broke my head acrossand has given Sir Toby

2233
01:52:56.230 --> 01:52:59.030
a bloody coxcomb too: forthe love of God, your help!

2234
01:52:59.030 --> 01:53:01.230
I had rather than fortypound I were at home.

2235
01:53:01.230 --> 01:53:02.970
Who has done this, SirAndrew?

2236
01:53:02.970 --> 01:53:04.300
The count's gentleman,one Cesario:

2237
01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:05.500
we took him for a coward,

2238
01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:07.270
but he's the verydevil incardinate.

2239
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:08.800
My gentleman, Cesario?

2240
01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:13.570
'Od's lifelings, here he is!You broke my head for nothing;

2241
01:53:13.570 --> 01:53:16.570
and that that I did, I wasset on to do't by Sir Toby.

2242
01:53:16.570 --> 01:53:18.970
Why do you speak to me? Inever hurt you:

2243
01:53:18.970 --> 01:53:21.100
You drew your sword uponme without cause;

2244
01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:24.170
But I bespoke you fair,and hurt you not.

2245
01:53:24.170 --> 01:53:26.770
If a bloody coxcomb be ahurt, you have hurt me:

2246
01:53:26.770 --> 01:53:29.500
I think you set nothingby a bloody coxcomb.

2247
01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:32.330
Here comes Sir Toby halting;you shall hear more:

2248
01:53:32.330 --> 01:53:33.430
but if he had notbeen in drink,

2249
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:35.530
he would have tickled youothergates than he did.

2250
01:53:35.530 --> 01:53:36.870
How now, gentleman! howis't with you?

2251
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:46.930
That's all one: has hurt me,and there's the end on't.

2252
01:53:46.930 --> 01:53:48.930
Sot, didst see Dicksurgeon, sot?

2253
01:53:48.930 --> 01:53:50.700
O, he's drunk, SirToby, an hour agone;

2254
01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:52.470
his eyes were set ateight i' the morning.

2255
01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:55.970
Then he's a rogue, and apassy measures panyn:

2256
01:53:55.970 --> 01:53:59.270
I hate a drunken rogue.

2257
01:53:59.270 --> 01:54:02.700
Away with him! Who hathmade this havoc with them?

2258
01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:03.770
I'll help you, Sir Toby,

2259
01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:05.530
because well bedressed together.

2260
01:54:05.530 --> 01:54:09.730
Will you help? an ass-headand a coxcomb and a knave,

2261
01:54:09.730 --> 01:54:13.930
a thin-faced knave, a gull!

2262
01:54:13.930 --> 01:54:25.970
Get him to bed, and lethis hurt be look'd to.

2263
01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:27.870
I am sorry, madam, I havehurt your kinsman:

2264
01:54:27.870 --> 01:54:29.070
But, had it been thebrother of my blood,

2265
01:54:29.070 --> 01:54:33.100
I must have done no lesswith wit and safety.

2266
01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:36.000
You throw a strange regardupon me, and by that

2267
01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.800
I do perceive it hathoffended you:

2268
01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:39.970
Pardon me, sweet one, evenfor the vows

2269
01:54:39.970 --> 01:54:42.830
We made each other but solate ago.

2270
01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:48.200
One face, one voice, onehabit, and two persons,

2271
01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:51.070
A natural perspective,that is and is not!

2272
01:54:51.070 --> 01:54:55.930
Antonio, O my dearAntonio!

2273
01:54:55.930 --> 01:54:57.470
How have the hours rack'dand tortured me,

2274
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:59.030
Since I have lost thee!

2275
01:54:59.030 --> 01:55:01.030
Sebastian are you?

2276
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:02.770
Fear'st thou that,Antonio?

2277
01:55:02.770 --> 01:55:04.670
How have you made divisionof yourself?

2278
01:55:04.670 --> 01:55:06.700
An apple, cleft in two, isnot more twin

2279
01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:13.400
Than these two creatures.Which is Sebastian?

2280
01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:15.830
Most wonderful!

2281
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:22.270
Do I stand there? I neverhad a brother;

2282
01:55:22.270 --> 01:55:23.930
Nor can there be thatdeity in my nature,

2283
01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:28.070
Of here and every where. Ihad a sister,

2284
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:30.400
Whom the blind waves andsurges have devour'd.

2285
01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:32.930
Of charity, what kin areyou to me?

2286
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:35.230
What countryman? whatname? what parentage?

2287
01:55:35.230 --> 01:55:39.530
Of Messaline: Sebastianwas my father;

2288
01:55:39.530 --> 01:55:42.400
Such a Sebastian was mybrother too,

2289
01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:46.600
So went he suited to hiswatery tomb:

2290
01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:49.000
If spirits can assume bothform and suit

2291
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.330
You come to fright us.

2292
01:55:50.330 --> 01:55:52.070
A spirit I am indeed;

2293
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:54.030
But am in that dimensiongrossly clad

2294
01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:57.100
Which from the womb I didparticipate.

2295
01:55:57.100 --> 01:55:58.470
Were you a woman, as therest goes even,

2296
01:55:58.470 --> 01:56:01.430
I should my tears let fallupon your cheek,

2297
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:04.030
And say 'Thrice-welcome,drowned Viola!'

2298
01:56:04.030 --> 01:56:05.930
My father had a mole uponhis brow.

2299
01:56:05.930 --> 01:56:06.900
And so had mine.

2300
01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:08.830
And died that day whenViola from her birth

2301
01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:10.500
Had number'd thirteenyears.

2302
01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:12.400
O, that record is livelyin my soul!

2303
01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:13.970
He finished indeed hismortal act

2304
01:56:13.970 --> 01:56:15.770
That day that made mysister thirteen years.

2305
01:56:15.770 --> 01:56:18.770
If nothing lets to make ushappy both

2306
01:56:18.770 --> 01:56:21.400
But this my masculineusurp'd attire,

2307
01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:24.130
Do not embrace me tilleach circumstance

2308
01:56:24.130 --> 01:56:28.200
Of place, time, fortune,do cohere and jump

2309
01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:33.130
That I am Viola: which toconfirm,

2310
01:56:33.130 --> 01:56:35.000
I'll bring you to acaptain in this town,

2311
01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:38.530
Where lie my maiden weeds;by whose gentle help

2312
01:56:38.530 --> 01:56:43.800
I was preserved to servethis noble count.

2313
01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:46.870
All the occurrence of myfortune since

2314
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:52.500
Hath been between thislady and this lord.

2315
01:56:55.270 --> 01:57:00.070
So comes it, lady, youhave been mistook:

2316
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:03.630
But nature to her biasdrew in that.

2317
01:57:03.630 --> 01:57:06.770
You would have beencontracted to a maid;

2318
01:57:06.770 --> 01:57:09.000
Nor are you therein, by mylife, deceived,

2319
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.570
You are betroth'd both toa maid and man.

2320
01:57:13.570 --> 01:57:19.300
Be not amazed; right nobleis his blood.

2321
01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:21.300
If this be so, as yet theglass seems true,

2322
01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:25.430
I shall have share in thismost happy wreck.

2323
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:29.500
Boy, thou hast said to mea thousand times

2324
01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:32.070
Thou never shouldst lovewoman like to me.

2325
01:57:32.070 --> 01:57:34.800
And all those sayings willI overswear;

2326
01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:36.770
And those swearings keepas true in soul

2327
01:57:36.770 --> 01:57:39.530
As doth that orbedcontinent the fire

2328
01:57:39.530 --> 01:57:41.130
That severs day fromnight.

2329
01:57:41.130 --> 01:57:43.570
Give me thy hand;

2330
01:57:43.570 --> 01:57:45.430
And let me see thee in thywoman's weeds.

2331
01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:47.400
The captain that did bringme first on shore

2332
01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:50.400
Hath my maid's garments:he upon some action

2333
01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:52.270
Is now in durance, atMalvolio's suit,

2334
01:57:52.270 --> 01:57:54.730
A gentleman, and followerof my lady's.

2335
01:57:54.730 --> 01:57:58.100
He shall enlarge him:fetch Malvolio hither:

2336
01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:00.970
And yet, alas, now Iremember me,

2337
01:58:00.970 --> 01:58:03.670
They say, poor gentleman,he's much distract.

2338
01:58:03.670 --> 01:58:05.630
A most extracting frenzyof mine own

2339
01:58:05.630 --> 01:58:09.100
From my remembranceclearly banish'd his.

2340
01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:11.100
How does he, sirrah?

2341
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:13.430
Truly, madam, he holdsBelzebub at the staves's end

2342
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:15.500
as well as a man inhis case may do:

2343
01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:17.270
has here writ a letter to you;

2344
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:19.630
I should have given'tyou to-day morning,

2345
01:58:19.630 --> 01:58:22.870
but as a madman'sepistles are no gospels,

2346
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:25.470
so it skills not much whenthey are delivered.

2347
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:29.170
Open't, and read it.

2348
01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:30.830
Look then to be well edified

2349
01:58:30.830 --> 01:58:32.730
when the fooldelivers the madman.

2350
01:58:32.730 --> 01:58:34.270
'By the Lord, madam,'--

2351
01:58:34.270 --> 01:58:36.230
How now! art thou mad?

2352
01:58:36.230 --> 01:58:38.370
No, madam, I do but readmadness: an your ladyship

2353
01:58:38.370 --> 01:58:40.670
will have it as it oughtto be, you must allow Vox.

2354
01:58:40.670 --> 01:58:42.630
Prithee, read i' thy rightwits.

2355
01:58:42.630 --> 01:58:45.530
So I do, madonna; but to readhis right wits is to read thus:

2356
01:58:45.530 --> 01:58:48.100
therefore perpend, myprincess, and give ear.

2357
01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:49.100
Read it you, sirrah.

2358
01:58:49.100 --> 01:59:01.370
'By the Lord, madam,you wrong me,

2359
01:59:01.370 --> 01:59:03.100
and the world shall know it:

2360
01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:04.670
though you have putme into darkness

2361
01:59:04.670 --> 01:59:07.770
and given your drunkencousin rule over me,

2362
01:59:07.770 --> 01:59:11.000
yet have I thebenefit of my senses

2363
01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.830
as well as your ladyship.

2364
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:14.330
I have your own letter

2365
01:59:14.330 --> 01:59:18.970
that induced me to thesemblance I put on;

2366
01:59:18.970 --> 01:59:21.430
with the which I doubt notbut to do myself much right,

2367
01:59:21.430 --> 01:59:24.430
or you much shame.

2368
01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:26.970
Think of me as youplease. I leave my duty

2369
01:59:26.970 --> 01:59:30.830
a little unthought of andspeak out of my injury.

2370
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:33.100
THE MADLY-USED .'MALVOLIO

2371
01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:34.370
Did he write this?

2372
01:59:34.370 --> 01:59:35.200
Ay, madam.

2373
01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:37.200
This savours not much ofdistraction.

2374
01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:39.870
See him deliver'd, Fabian;bring him hither.

2375
01:59:42.770 --> 01:59:46.570
My lord, thesethings further thought on,

2376
01:59:46.570 --> 01:59:49.700
To think me as well asister as a wife,

2377
01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:53.070
One day shall crown thealliance on't, so please you,

2378
01:59:53.070 --> 01:59:55.700
Here at my house and at myproper cost.

2379
01:59:55.700 --> 02:00:01.730
Madam, I am most apt toembrace your offer.

2380
02:00:01.730 --> 02:00:05.600
Your master quits you; andfor your service done him,

2381
02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:08.270
So much against the mettleof your sex,

2382
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:12.100
So far beneath your softand tender breeding,

2383
02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:15.630
And since you call'd memaster for so long,

2384
02:00:15.630 --> 02:00:18.770
Here is my hand: you shallfrom this time be

2385
02:00:18.770 --> 02:00:22.270
Your master's mistress.

2386
02:00:22.270 --> 02:00:28.870
A sister! you are she.

2387
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:30.430
Is this the madman?

2388
02:00:30.430 --> 02:00:33.270
Ay, my lord, this same.

2389
02:00:33.270 --> 02:00:35.530
How now, Malvolio!

2390
02:00:35.530 --> 02:00:38.870
Madam, you have done mewrong,

2391
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:39.830
Notorious wrong.

2392
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:41.300
Have I, Malvolio? no.

2393
02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:45.000
Lady, you have. Pray you,peruse that letter.

2394
02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.530
You must not now deny itis your hand:

2395
02:00:47.530 --> 02:00:48.970
Write from it, if you can,in hand or phrase;

2396
02:00:48.970 --> 02:00:51.970
Or say 'tis not your seal,nor your invention:

2397
02:00:51.970 --> 02:00:54.330
You can say none of this:well, grant it then

2398
02:00:54.330 --> 02:00:56.470
And tell me, in themodesty of honour,

2399
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:58.100
Why you have given me suchclear lights of favour,

2400
02:00:58.100 --> 02:01:01.600
Bade me come smiling andcross-garter'd to you,

2401
02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:03.000
To put on yellow stockingsand to frown

2402
02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.700
Upon Sir Toby and thelighter people;

2403
02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:07.270
And, acting this in anobedient hope,

2404
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:09.630
Why have you suffer'd meto be imprison'd,

2405
02:01:09.630 --> 02:01:13.170
Kept in a dark house,visited by the priest,

2406
02:01:13.170 --> 02:01:14.800
And made the mostnotorious geck and gull

2407
02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:18.030
That e'er invention play'don? tell me why.

2408
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:20.700
Alas, Malvolio, this isnot my writing,

2409
02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:22.430
Though, I confess, muchlike the character

2410
02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:26.270
But out of question 'tisMaria's hand.

2411
02:01:26.270 --> 02:01:28.700
And now I do bethink me,it was she

2412
02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:31.970
First told me thou wast mad;then camest in smiling,

2413
02:01:31.970 --> 02:01:34.430
And in such forms whichhere were presupposed

2414
02:01:34.430 --> 02:01:38.500
Upon thee in the letter.Prithee, be content:

2415
02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:41.100
This practise hath mostshrewdly pass'd upon thee;

2416
02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:43.200
But when we know thegrounds and authors of it,

2417
02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:45.030
Thou shalt be both theplaintiff and the judge

2418
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:48.930
Of thine own cause.

2419
02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:56.670
Good madam, hear me speak,

2420
02:01:56.670 --> 02:01:59.670
And let no quarrel nor nobrawl to come

2421
02:01:59.670 --> 02:02:01.800
Taint the condition ofthis present hour,

2422
02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:04.570
Which I have wonder'd at.In hope it shall not,

2423
02:02:04.570 --> 02:02:07.470
Most freely I confess,myself and Toby

2424
02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:11.170
Set this device againstMalvolio here,

2425
02:02:11.170 --> 02:02:12.600
Upon some stubborn anduncourteous parts

2426
02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:16.830
We had conceived againsthim: Maria writ

2427
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:21.500
The letter at Sir Toby'sgreat importance;

2428
02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:26.230
In recompense whereof hehath married her.

2429
02:02:26.230 --> 02:02:27.930
How with a sportful maliceit was follow'd,

2430
02:02:27.930 --> 02:02:32.100
May rather pluck onlaughter than revenge;

2431
02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:33.630
If that the injuries bejustly weigh'd

2432
02:02:33.630 --> 02:02:36.470
That have on both sidespass'd.

2433
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:42.900
Alas, poor fool, how havethey baffled thee!

2434
02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:47.300
Why, 'some are born great,some achieve greatness,

2435
02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:51.030
and some have greatnessthrown upon them.'

2436
02:02:51.770 --> 02:02:56.730
I was one, sir, in thisinterlude; one Sir Topas, sir;

2437
02:02:56.730 --> 02:03:01.470
but that's all one. 'By theLord, fool, I am not mad.'

2438
02:03:01.470 --> 02:03:03.930
But do you remember?

2439
02:03:03.930 --> 02:03:07.500
'Madam, why laugh you atsuch a barren rascal?

2440
02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:10.300
an you smile not, he's gagged:'

2441
02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:18.770
and thus the whirligig oftime brings in his revenges.

2442
02:03:18.770 --> 02:03:23.170
I'll be revenged on thewhole pack of you.

2443
02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:30.800
He hath been mostnotoriously abused.

2444
02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:34.470
Pursue him and entreat himto a peace:

2445
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:37.870
He hath not told us of thecaptain yet:

2446
02:03:37.870 --> 02:03:40.930
When that is known andgolden time convents,

2447
02:03:40.930 --> 02:03:42.530
A solemn combination shallbe made

2448
02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:45.900
Of our dear souls.Meantime, sweet sister,

2449
02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:51.700
We will not part fromhence. Cesario, come;

2450
02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:54.400
For so you shall be, whileyou are a man;

2451
02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:56.800
But when in other habitsyou are seen,

2452
02:03:56.800 --> 02:04:05.700
Orsino's mistress and hisfancy's queen.

2453
02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:18.030
[Sings]

2454
02:04:18.030 --> 02:04:22.800
When that I was and alittle tiny boy,

2455
02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:27.670
With hey, ho, the wind andthe rain,

2456
02:04:27.670 --> 02:04:32.370
A foolish thing was but atoy,

2457
02:04:32.370 --> 02:04:37.900
For the rain it rainethevery day.

2458
02:04:37.900 --> 02:04:42.730
But when I came to man'sestate,

2459
02:04:42.730 --> 02:04:47.730
With hey, ho, the wind and therain.

2460
02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:54.870
'Gainst knaves and thievesmen shut their gate,

2461
02:04:54.870 --> 02:05:00.400
For the rain, it rain'th everyday.

2462
02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:05.830
It rain'th every day.

2463
02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:10.430
But when I came, alas! towive,

2464
02:05:10.430 --> 02:05:15.570
With hey, ho, the wind and therain

2465
02:05:15.570 --> 02:05:20.730
By swaggering could Inever thrive,

2466
02:05:20.730 --> 02:05:26.130
For the rain, it rain'th everyday.

2467
02:05:26.130 --> 02:05:31.200
But when I came unto mybeds,

2468
02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:36.970
With hey, ho, the wind andthe rain.

2469
02:05:36.970 --> 02:05:42.730
With toss-pots still haddrunken heads,

2470
02:05:42.730 --> 02:05:48.370
For the rain, it rain'th everyday.

2471
02:05:48.370 --> 02:05:54.330
It rain'th every day.

2472
02:05:54.330 --> 02:06:00.170
A great while ago theworld begun,

2473
02:06:00.170 --> 02:06:06.300
With hey, ho, the wind and therain.

2474
02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:13.630
But that's all one, ourplay is done,

2475
02:06:13.630 --> 02:06:20.800
And we'll strive to pleaseyou every day.

2476
02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:27.870
To please you every day.
