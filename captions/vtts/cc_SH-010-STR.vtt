00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:12.370


2
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.300
If music be the food of love, play on;

3
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.200
Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,

4
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.030
The appetite may sicken, and so die.

5
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.900
That strain again! it had a dying fall:

6
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.070
O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,

7
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.370
That breathes upon a bank of violets,

8
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.200
Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:

9
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.900
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.

10
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.900
O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,

11
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.630
That, notwithstanding thy capacity

12
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.770
Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,

13
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.600
Of what validity and pitch soe'er,

14
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.470
But falls into abatement and low price,

15
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.670
Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy

16
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.230
That it alone is high fantastical.

17
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.730
Will you go hunt, my lord?

18
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.400
What, Curio?

19
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.300
The hart.

20
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.300
Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:

21
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.100
O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,

22
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.700
Methought she purged the air of pestilence!

23
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.600
That instant was I turn'd into a hart;

24
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.970
And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,

25
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.100
E'er since pursue me.

26
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.670
How now! what news from her?

27
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.170
So please my lord, I might not be admitted;

28
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.100
But from her handmaid do return this answer:

29
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.970
The element itself, till seven years' heat,

30
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.500
Shall not behold her face at ample view;

31
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.430
But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk

32
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.470
And water once a day her chamber round

33
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.800
With eye-offending brine: all this to season

34
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.970
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh

35
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.530
And lasting in her sad remembrance.

36
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.130
O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame

37
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.070
To pay this debt of love but to a brother,

38
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.270
How will she love, when the rich golden shaft

39
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.200
Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else

40
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.170
That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,

41
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.700
These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd

42
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.470
Her sweet perfections with one self king!

43
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.500
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:

44
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.600
Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.

45
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.870
What country, friends, is this?

46
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.070
This is Illyria, lady.

47
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.600
And what should I do in Illyria?

48
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.100
My brother he is in Elysium.

49
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.630
Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?

50
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.600
It is perchance that you yourself were saved.

51
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.730
O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.

52
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.800
True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,

53
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.100
Assure yourself, after our ship did split,

54
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.770
When you and those poor number saved with you

55
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.500
Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,

56
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.370
Most provident in peril, bind himself,

57
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.830
Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,

58
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.670
To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;

59
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.230
Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,

60
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.970
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves

61
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.300
So long as I could see.

62
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.930
For saying so, there's gold:

63
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.530
Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,

64
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.530
Whereto thy speech serves for authority,

65
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.800
The like of him. Know'st thou this country?

66
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.400
Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born

67
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.370
Not three hours' travel from this very place.

68
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.770
Who governs here?

69
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.670
A noble duke, in nature as in name.

70
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.370
What is the name?

71
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.300
Orsino.

72
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.530
Orsino! I have heard my father name him:

73
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.530
He was a bachelor then.

74
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.430
And so is now, or was so very late;

75
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.970
For but a month ago I went from hence,

76
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.470
And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,

77
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.570
What great ones do the less will prattle of,--

78
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.100
That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.

79
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.800
What's she?

80
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.570
A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count

81
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.400
That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her

82
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.870
In the protection of his son, her brother,

83
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.730
Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,

84
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.630
They say, she hath abjured the company

85
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.730
And sight of men.

86
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.970
O that I served that lady

87
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.970
And might not be delivered to the world,

88
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.630
Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,

89
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.230
What my estate is!

90
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.470
That were hard to compass;

91
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.170
Because she will admit no kind of suit,

92
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.130
No, not the duke's.

93
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.870
There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;

94
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.800
And though that nature with a beauteous wall

95
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.670
Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee

96
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.330
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits

97
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.430
With this thy fair and outward character.

98
00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.900
I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,

99
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.830
Conceal me what I am, and be my aid

100
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.130
For such disguise as haply shall become

101
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.530
The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:

102
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.730
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:

103
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.070
It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing

104
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.070
And speak to him in many sorts of music

105
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.100
That will allow me very worth his service.

106
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.370
What else may hap to time I will commit;

107
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.000
Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.

108
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.070
Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:

109
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.270
When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.

110
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.470
I thank thee: lead me on.

111
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.670
What a plague means my niece,

112
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.670
to take the death of her brother thus?

113
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.570
I am sure care's an enemy to life.

114
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:57.470
By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights:

115
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.030
your cousin, my lady, takes great

116
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.530
exceptions to your ill hours.

117
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.000
Why, let her except, before excepted.

118
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.230
Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest

119
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.330
limits of order.

120
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.700
Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:

121
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.230
these clothes are good enough to drink in;

122
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.230
and so be these boots too: an they be not,

123
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.600
let them hang themselves in their own straps.

124
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.300
That quaffing and drinking will undo you:

125
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.530
I heard my lady talk of it yesterday;

126
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.430
and of a foolish knight

127
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.570
that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.

128
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.900
Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?

129
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.370
Ay, he.

130
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.800
He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.

131
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.030
What's that to the purpose?

132
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.330
Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.

133
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.970
Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:

134
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.070
he's a very fool and a prodigal.

135
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.900
Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the viol-de-gamboys,

136
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.330
and speaks three or four languages

137
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.300
word for word without book,

138
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.870
and hath all the good gifts of nature.

139
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.330
He hath indeed, almost natural:

140
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.930
for besides that he's a fool, he's a great quarreller:

141
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.030
and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay

142
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.300
the gust he hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent

143
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.570
he would quickly have the gift of a grave.

144
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.530
By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors

145
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.070
that say so of him. Who are they?

146
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.970
They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.

147
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.800
With drinking healths to my niece:

148
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.230
I'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat

149
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.700
and drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill

150
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.900
that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn

151
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.370
o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!

152
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:35.030
Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.

153
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:47.600
Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!

154
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.970
Sweet Sir Andrew!

155
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.430
Bless you, fair shrew.

156
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.400
And you too, sir.

157
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.730
Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.

158
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:54.630
What's that?

159
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.800
My niece's chambermaid.

160
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.970
Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.

161
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.370
My name is Mary, sir.

162
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.630
Good Mistress Mary Accost,--

163
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.830
You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her,

164
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.400
board her, woo her, assail her.

165
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.730
By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company.

166
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.070
Is that the meaning of 'accost'?

167
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.230
Fare you well, gentlemen.

168
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.730
An thou let part so, Sir Andrew,

169
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.430
would thou mightst never draw sword again.

170
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.870
An you part so, mistress,

171
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.000
I would I might never draw sword again.

172
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.370
Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?

173
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.500
Sir, I have not you by the hand.

174
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.830
Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.

175
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.430
Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you,

176
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.900
bring your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.

177
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.800
Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?

178
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.000
It's dry, sir.

179
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.670
Why, I think so: I am not such an ass

180
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.130
but I can keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?

181
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.330
A dry jest, sir.

182
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:48.300
Are you full of them?

183
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.970
Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends:

184
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:56.400
marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.

185
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.870
O knight thou lackest a cup of canary:

186
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.100
when did I see thee so put down?

187
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.630
Never in your life, I think;

188
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.830
unless you see canary put me down.

189
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.570
Methinks sometimes I have no more wit

190
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.330
than a Christian or an ordinary man has:

191
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.630
but I am a great eater of beef

192
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.030
and I believe that does harm to my wit.

193
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.930
No question.

194
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.700
An I thought that, I'ld forswear it.

195
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.700
I'll ride home to-morrow, Sir Toby.

196
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.570
Pourquoi, my dear knight?

197
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.630
What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do?

198
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.700
I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues

199
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.970
that I have in fencing, dancing and bear-baiting:

200
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.570
O, had I but followed the arts!

201
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.770
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.

202
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.200
Why, would that have mended my hair?

203
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.570
Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.

204
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.900
But it becomes me well enough, does't not?

205
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.830
Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff;

206
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.800
and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs

207
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.230
and spin it off.

208
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.200
Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby:

209
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.900
your niece will not be seen; or if she be,

210
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.070
it's four to one she'll none of me:

211
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.970
the count himself here hard by woos her.

212
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.470
She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above her degree,

213
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:06.870
neither in estate, years, nor wit;

214
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:13.030
I have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't, man.

215
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.900
I'll stay a month longer.

216
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.830
I am a fellow o' the strangest mind i' the world;

217
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:21.700
I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.

218
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.900
Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?

219
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.130
As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be,

220
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.430
under the degree of my betters;

221
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.500
and yet I will not compare with an old man.

222
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.130
What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?

223
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.970
Faith, I can cut a caper.

224
00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:35.400
And I can cut the mutton to't.

225
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.430
And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong

226
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.300
as any man in Illyria.

227
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.900
Wherefore are these things hid?

228
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.470
wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em?

229
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.500
are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture?

230
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.400
why dost thou not go to church in a galliard

231
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.270
and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig;

232
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:57.470
I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace.

233
00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.700
What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?

234
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:05.100
I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg,

235
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.170
it was formed under the star of a galliard.

236
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.270
Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well

237
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.670
in a flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?

238
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.000
What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?

239
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.200
Taurus! That's sides and heart.

240
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.770
No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the caper;

241
00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:29.630
ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!

242
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.570
If the duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario,

243
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.430
you are like to be much advanced:

244
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.570
he hath known you but three days,

245
00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.600
and already you are no stranger.

246
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.730
You either fear his humour or my negligence,

247
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.570
that you call in question the continuance of his love:

248
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.470
is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?

249
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.130
No, believe me.

250
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.370
I thank you. Here comes the count.

251
00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.830
Who saw Cesario, ho?

252
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.830
On your attendance, my lord; here.

253
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:03.200
Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,

254
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.530
Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd

255
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.470
To thee the book even of my secret soul:

256
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.200
Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;

257
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.670
Be not denied access, stand at her doors,

258
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.830
And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow

259
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.830
Till thou have audience.

260
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:18.930
Sure, my noble lord,

261
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.400
If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow

262
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.900
As it is spoke, she never will admit me.

263
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.100
Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds

264
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.970
Rather than make unprofited return.

265
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.870
Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?

266
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.930
O, then unfold the passion of my love,

267
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.470
Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:

268
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.770
It shall become thee well to act my woes;

269
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.930
She will attend it better in thy youth

270
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.970
Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.

271
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.470
I think not so, my lord.

272
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.470
Dear lad, believe it;

273
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.670
For they shall yet belie thy happy years,

274
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.770
That say thou art a man: Diana's lip

275
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.630
Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe Is

276
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:02.830
as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,

277
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.370
And all is semblative a woman's part.

278
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.330
I know thy constellation is right apt

279
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.570
For this affair. Some four or five attend him;

280
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:15.230
All, if you will; for I myself am best

281
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.530
When least in company. Prosper well in this,

282
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.000
And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,

283
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.770
To call his fortunes thine.

284
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:23.700
I'll do my best

285
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.370
To woo your lady:

286
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.430
yet, a barful strife!

287
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:35.170
Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.

288
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.470
Nay, either tell me where thou hast been,

289
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.500
or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter

290
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.700
in way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.

291
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.970
Let her hang me:

292
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.330
he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colours.

293
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.430
Make that good.

294
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.500
He shall see none to fear.

295
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.630
A good lenten answer:

296
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.200
I can tell thee where that saying was born,

297
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.730
of 'I fear no colours.'

298
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.000
Where, good Mistress Mary?

299
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.970
In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.

300
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.930
Well, God give them wisdom that have it;

301
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.570
and those that are fools, let them use their talents.

302
00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.270
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent;

303
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:16.200
or, to be turned away,

304
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.030
is not that as good as a hanging to you?

305
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.200
Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage;

306
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.500
and, for turning away, let summer bear it out.

307
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.570
You are resolute, then?

308
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.570
Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.

309
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.700
That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both break,

310
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.770
your gaskins fall.

311
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.800
Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way;

312
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.770
if Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty

313
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.270
a piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.

314
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:42.370
Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my lady:

315
00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:45.070
make your excuse wisely, you were best.

316
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.330
Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!

317
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:50.530
Those wits, that think they have thee,

318
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.830
do very oft prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee,

319
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:57.830
may pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?

320
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.370
'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'

321
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.700
God bless thee, lady!

322
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.770
Take the fool away.

323
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.030
Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.

324
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:09.970
Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:

325
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.930
besides, you grow dishonest.

326
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.970
Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel

327
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.800
will amend: for give the dry fool drink,

328
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.300
then is the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend himself;

329
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.430
if he mend, he is no longer dishonest;

330
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.470
if he cannot, let the botcher mend him.

331
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.900
Any thing that's mended is but patched:

332
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.430
virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin;

333
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:32.630
and sin that amends is but patched with virtue.

334
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.330
If that this simple syllogism will serve, so;

335
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.230
if it will not, what remedy?

336
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:42.930
As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty's a flower.

337
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.130
The lady bade take away the fool;

338
00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:45.600
therefore, I say again, take her away.

339
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.700
Sir, I bade them take away you.

340
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.600
Misprision in the highest degree!

341
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.630
Good madonna,

342
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.900
give me leave to prove you a fool.

343
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.030
Can you do it?

344
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.200
Dexterously, good madonna.

345
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.100
Make your proof.

346
00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.430
I must catechise you for it, madonna:

347
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.700
good my mouse of virtue, answer me.

348
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.670
Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.

349
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.930
Good madonna, why mournest thou?

350
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.630
Good fool, for my brother's death.

351
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.770
I think his soul is in hell, madonna.

352
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.000
I know his soul is in heaven, fool.

353
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.700
The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's

354
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.830
soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.

355
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:26.400
What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?

356
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.900
Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:

357
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.570
infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.

358
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.030
God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the

359
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.330
better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn

360
00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.930
that I am no fox; but he will not pass his word

361
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.030
for two pence that you are no fool.

362
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.430
How say you to that, Malvolio?

363
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.630
I marvel your ladyship takes delight

364
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.630
in such a barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day

365
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.470
with an ordinary fool that has no more brain

366
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:58.000
than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard already;

367
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.670
unless you laugh and minister occasion to him,

368
00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:04.270
he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,

369
00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.870
that crow so at these set kind of fools,

370
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.570
no better than the fools' zanies.

371
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.970
Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio,

372
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.330
and taste with a distempered appetite.

373
00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.030
To be generous, guiltless and of free disposition,

374
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.970
is to take those things for bird-bolts

375
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.030
that you deem cannon-bullets:

376
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.830
there is no slander in an allowed fool,

377
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:26.200
though he do nothing but rail;

378
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.630
nor no railing in a known discreet man,

379
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.900
though he do nothing but reprove.

380
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.270
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou

381
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.700
speakest well of fools!

382
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.730
Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman

383
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.900
much desires to speak with you.

384
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.300
From the Count Orsino, is it?

385
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.070
I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.

386
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.530
Who of my people hold him in delay?

387
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:49.770
Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.

388
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.970
Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but madman:

389
00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.000
fie on him!

390
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.170
Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count,

391
00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:01.600
I am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.

392
00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.430
Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old,

393
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:09.630
and people dislike it.

394
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.900
Thou hast spoke for us, madonna,

395
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.370
as if thy eldest son should be a fool;

396
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:17.170
whose skull Jove cram with brains! for,--here he comes,

397
00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.070
--one of thy kin has a most weak pia mater.

398
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:24.770
By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?

399
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.500
A gentleman.

400
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.570
A gentleman! what gentleman?

401
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:36.500
'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' these pickle-herring!

402
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.770
How now, sot!

403
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:41.270
Good Sir Toby!

404
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.700
Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?

405
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:49.870
Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.

406
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.530
Ay, marry, what is he?

407
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.100
Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not:

408
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.500
give me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.

409
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.630
What's a drunken man like, fool?

410
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.600
Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man:

411
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.370
one draught above heat makes him a fool;

412
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.500
the second mads him; and a third drowns him.

413
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.870
Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my coz;

414
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.370
for he's in the third degree of drink,

415
00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:22.170
he's drowned: go, look after him.

416
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.100
He is but mad yet, madonna;

417
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.270
and the fool shall look to the madman.

418
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.400
Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you.

419
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.970
I told him you were sick;

420
00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.400
he takes on him to understand so much,

421
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.830
and therefore comes to speak with you.

422
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.170
I told him you were asleep;

423
00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.970
he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too,

424
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.600
and therefore comes to speak with you.

425
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.370
What is to be said to him, lady?

426
00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.800
he's fortified against any denial.

427
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.030
Tell him he shall not speak with me.

428
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.700
Has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your door

429
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.600
like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to a bench,

430
00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.800
but he'll speak with you.

431
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.430
What kind o' man is he?

432
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.200
Why, of mankind.

433
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.430
What manner of man?

434
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.030
Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.

435
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.970
Of what personage and years is he?

436
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.770
Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy;

437
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.770
as a squash is before 'tis a peascod,

438
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.630
or a cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him

439
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.930
in standing water, between boy and man.

440
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:25.000
He is very well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly;

441
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.400
one would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.

442
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.830
Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.

443
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.670
Gentlewoman, my lady calls.

444
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:39.030
Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.

445
00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:46.200
We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.

446
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.600
The honourable lady of the house, which is she?

447
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.670
Speak to me; I shall answer for her.

448
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:54.670
Your will?

449
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:59.600
Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,

450
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.930
--I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,

451
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.030
for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away

452
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:07.800
my speech, for besides that it is excellently well penned,

453
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.830
I have taken great pains to con it.

454
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:13.130
Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn;

455
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.030
I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.

456
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.300
Whence came you, sir?

457
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.800
I can say little more than I have studied,

458
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.800
and that question's out of my part. Good gentle one,

459
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.230
give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,

460
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.070
that I may proceed in my speech.

461
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.800
Are you a comedian?

462
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.800
No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs

463
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.870
of malice I swear, I am not that I play.

464
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.700
Are you the lady of the house?

465
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.470
If I do not usurp myself, I am.

466
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:44.170
Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself;

467
00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:47.530
for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve.

468
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.470
But this is from my commission:

469
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.370
I will on with my speech in your praise,

470
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.770
and then show you the heart of my message.

471
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.800
Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.

472
00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.800
Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.

473
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.270
It is the more like to be feigned:

474
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.470
I pray you, keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,

475
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.930
and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you

476
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:11.330
than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone;

477
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:13.830
if you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time

478
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.800
of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.

479
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.500
Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.

480
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.300
No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little longer.

481
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.730
Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady.

482
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.430
Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.

483
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.070
Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver,

484
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:36.270
when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.

485
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:42.000
It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war,

486
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.170
no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my hand;

487
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.600
my words are as fun of peace as matter.

488
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.800
Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?

489
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.370
The rudeness that hath appeared in me

490
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.800
have I learned from my entertainment.

491
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.000
What I am, and what I would,

492
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.730
are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears, divinity,

493
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.870
to any other's, profanation.

494
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:09.930
Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.

495
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.600
Now, sir, what is your text?

496
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.800
Most sweet lady,--

497
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.670
A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.

498
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:22.070
Where lies your text?

499
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.070
In Orsino's bosom.

500
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.230
In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?

501
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.870
To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.

502
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:33.330
O, I have read it: it is heresy.

503
00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.430
Have you no more to say?

504
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:39.830
Good madam, let me see your face.

505
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.570
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate

506
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:45.500
with my face? You are now out of your text:

507
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:50.470
but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.

508
00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:54.400
Look you, sir, such a one I was this present:

509
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.600
is't not well done?

510
00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.230
Excellently done, if God did all.

511
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:04.700
'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.

512
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.300
'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white

513
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.730
Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:

514
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.000
Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,

515
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.770
If you will lead these graces to the grave

516
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.400
And leave the world no copy.

517
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.030
O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted;

518
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.930
I will give out divers schedules of my beauty:

519
00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.730
it shall be inventoried, and every particle and utensil

520
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:31.930
labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,

521
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.500
indifferent red; item, two grey eyes,

522
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.800
with lids to them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth.

523
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.270
Were you sent hither to praise me?

524
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:44.570
I see you what you are, you are too proud;

525
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:50.700
But, if you were the devil, you are fair.

526
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:56.300
My lord and master loves you: O, such love

527
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.300
Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd

528
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.070
The nonpareil of beauty!

529
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.470
How does he love me?

530
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.170
With adorations, fertile tears,

531
00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:10.070
With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.

532
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.970
Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:

533
00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.830
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,

534
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:20.170
Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;

535
00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:25.670
In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;

536
00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.100
And in dimension and the shape of nature

537
00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.270
A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;

538
00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:32.670
He might have took his answer long ago.

539
00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:34.730
If I did love you in my master's flame,

540
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.170
With such a suffering, such a deadly life,

541
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.570
In your denial I would find no sense;

542
00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:41.770
I would not understand it.

543
00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:47.070
Why, what would you?

544
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.070
Make me a willow cabin at your gate,

545
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.970
And call upon my soul within the house;

546
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.500
Write loyal cantons of contemned love

547
00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:00.270
And sing them loud even in the dead of night;

548
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.000
Halloo your name to the reverberate hills

549
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
And make the babbling gossip of the air

550
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.900
Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest

551
00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.370
Between the elements of air and earth,

552
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.770
But you should pity me!

553
00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.130
You might do much.

554
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.000
What is your parentage?

555
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.930
Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:

556
00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.600
I am a gentleman.

557
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.800
Get you to your lord;

558
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.270
I cannot love him: let him send no more;

559
00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:35.200
Unless, perchance, you come to me again,

560
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:40.000
To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:

561
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.730
I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.

562
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.070
I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:

563
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:52.170
My master, not myself, lacks recompense.

564
00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:58.230
Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;

565
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.270
And let your fervor, like my master's,

566
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:05.800
be Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.

567
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:10.630
'What is your parentage?'

568
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.600
'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:

569
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.300
I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;

570
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.400
Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,

571
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:26.100
Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:

572
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.500
soft, soft!

573
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:34.070
Unless the master were the man. How now!

574
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:38.100
Even so quickly may one catch the plague?

575
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.430
Methinks I feel this youth's perfections

576
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:42.170
With an invisible and subtle stealth

577
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:49.100
To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.

578
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.600
What ho, Malvolio!

579
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.030
Here, madam, at your service.

580
00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.630
Run after that same peevish messenger,

581
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:58.170
The county's man: he left this ring behind him,

582
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:02.170
Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.

583
00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.930
Desire him not to flatter with his lord,

584
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:06.200
Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:

585
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.500
If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,

586
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.100
I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.

587
00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.730
Madam, I will.

588
00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.970
I do I know not what, and fear to find

589
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:22.300
Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.

590
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.500
Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;

591
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:34.270
What is decreed must be, and be this so.

592
00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.100
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?

593
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.100
Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since

594
00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.370
arrived but hither.

595
00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.170
She returns this ring to you, sir:

596
00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:47.400
you might have saved me my pains,

597
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.800
to have taken it away yourself.

598
00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.770
She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord

599
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.500
into a desperate assurance she will none of him:

600
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.830
and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to

601
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:57.130
come again in his affairs, unless it be to report

602
00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.600
your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.

603
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.630
She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.

604
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.130
Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her;

605
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:07.470
and her will is, it should be so returned:

606
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:10.530
if it be worth stooping for, there it lies in your eye;

607
00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.800
if not, be it his that finds it.

608
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:23.070
I left no ring with her: what means this lady?

609
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:29.300
Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!

610
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.600
She made good view of me; indeed, so much,

611
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.730
That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,

612
00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:37.630
For she did speak in starts distractedly.

613
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:40.400
She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion

614
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.130
Invites me in this churlish messenger.

615
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:46.370
None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.

616
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:53.430
I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,

617
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:57.030
Poor lady, she were better love a dream.

618
00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:01.500
Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,

619
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.830
Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.

620
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.500
How easy is it for the proper-false

621
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.900
In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!

622
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.630
Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!

623
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:17.330
For such as we are made of, such we be.

624
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:21.930
How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;

625
00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.130
And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;

626
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:27.870
And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.

627
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:31.930
What will become of this? As I am man,

628
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:34.530
My state is desperate for my master's love;

629
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:37.370
As I am woman,--now alas the day!--

630
00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:43.230
What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!

631
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:47.070
O time! thou must untangle this, not I;

632
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:50.570
It is too hard a knot for me to untie!

633
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.730
Will you stay no longer?

634
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:56.830
nor will you not that I go with you?

635
00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:00.230
By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me:

636
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:02.800
the malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours;

637
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.500
therefore I shall crave of you your leave

638
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.600
that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad

639
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.100
recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.

640
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.170
: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.

641
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:18.030
No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy.

642
00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.400
But I perceive in you so excellent

643
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.630
a touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me

644
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:24.570
what I am willing to keep in;

645
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:25.500
therefore it charges me

646
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.300
in manners the rather to express myself.

647
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:32.500
You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,

648
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.200
which I called Roderigo. My father was that

649
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.470
Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard of.

650
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:44.270
He left behind him myself and a sister,

651
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:47.930
both born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,

652
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:52.270
would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;

653
00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.370
for some hour before you took me from the breach of

654
00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:57.930
the sea was my sister drowned.

655
00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:00.270
Alas the day!

656
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:03.800
A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me,

657
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.530
was yet of many accounted beautiful:

658
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.800
but, though I could not with such estimable wonder

659
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:15.400
overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her;

660
00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:20.700
she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair.

661
00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.630
She is drowned already, sir, with salt water,

662
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:29.870
though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.

663
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.830
Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.

664
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:38.270
O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.

665
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.800
If you will not murder me for my love,

666
00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.070
let me be your servant.

667
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:45.170
If you will not undo what you have done, that is,

668
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:49.130
kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.

669
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:55.830
Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,

670
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:57.700
and I am yet so near the manners of my mother,

671
00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.330
that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell

672
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:03.430
tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.

673
00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:08.800
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!

674
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.700
I have many enemies in Orsino's court,

675
00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:14.170
Else would I very shortly see thee there.

676
00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:18.000
But, come what may, I do adore thee so,

677
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:22.730
That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.

678
00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:34.770
Approach, Sir Andrew:

679
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:44.770
not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes;

680
00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:51.070
and 'diluculo surgere,' thou know'st,--

681
00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:55.370
Nay, my troth, I know not: but I know,

682
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:57.570
to be up late is to be up late.

683
00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:01.070
A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can.

684
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:04.700
To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is early:

685
00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.700
so that to go to bed after midnight

686
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:10.830
is to go to bed betimes.

687
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:15.630
Does not our life consist of the four elements?

688
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:18.970
Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists

689
00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:20.530
of eating and drinking.

690
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:22.770
Thou'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.

691
00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:26.970
Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!

692
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.200
Here comes the fool, i' faith.

693
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.500
How now, my hearts! did you never see the picture

694
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.700
of 'we three'?

695
00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:45.900
Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.

696
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.270
By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast.

697
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:52.530
I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,

698
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:55.670
and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has.

699
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:59.400
Come on; there is sixpence for thee: let's have a song.

700
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:04.770
There's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--

701
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:08.400
Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?

702
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.070
A love-song, a love-song.

703
00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:13.700
Ay, ay: I care not for good life.

O mistress mine, where are you roaming?

O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,

707
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.870
That can sing both high and low:

708
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:39.070
Trip no further, pretty sweeting;

709
00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:45.470
Journeys end in lovers meeting,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.230
Excellent good, i' faith.

Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.

723

To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.

But shall we make the welkin dance indeed?

725
00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:02.770
shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three

An you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch.

728

By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.

729
00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.070
Most certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'

If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio

and bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me.

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.170
My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's

Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed,

Do ye make an alehouse of my lady's house,

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:04.470

757

Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time in you?

We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!

760
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:20.700
Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell you,

761
00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.630
that, though she harbours you as her kinsman,

762
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.230
she's nothing allied to your disorders.

763
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:30.030
If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors,

764
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:32.100
you are welcome to the house; if not,

765
00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.270
an it would please you to take leave of her,

766
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:34.830
she is very willing to bid you farewell.

767
00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:38.500
'Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.'

768
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:41.200
Nay, good Sir Toby.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.630
'His eyes do show his days are almost done.'

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:46.670
Is't even so?

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.500
'But I will never die.'

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:53.530
This is much credit to you.

'What an if you do?'

776
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.370
'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.300
'O no, no, no, no, you dare not.'

778
00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:09.870
Out o' tune, sir: ye lie. Art any more than a steward?

779
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:13.130
Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous,

780
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:16.030
there shall be no more cakes and ale?

781
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:19.130
Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too.

Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour

at any thing more than contempt,

786
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.330
you would not give means for this uncivil rule:

Do't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge:

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:59.700
Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight:

795
00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.430
since the youth of the count's was today with thy lady,

796
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:04.770
she is much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio,

797
00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:08.500
let me alone with him: if I do not gull him into a nayword,

798
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:09.970
and make him a common recreation,

799
00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:12.170
do not think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed:

800
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:13.230
I know I can do it.

801
00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:16.070
Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him.

802
00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:19.100
Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.

803
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.030
O, if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!

804
00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:27.530
What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason, dear knight?

805
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:29.970
I have no exquisite reason for't,

806
00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:32.370
but I have reason good enough.

807
00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:35.830
The devil a puritan that he is, or any thing constantly,

808
00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:38.670
but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass,

that cons state without book

810
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:43.270
and utters it by great swarths: the best persuaded of himself,

811
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:45.700
so crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies,

812
00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.970
that it is his grounds of faith

813
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:48.730
that all that look on him love him;

814
00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:50.830
and on that vice in him

815
00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:53.430
will my revenge find notable cause to work.

816
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:55.730
What wilt thou do?

817
00:42:55.730 --> 00:43:00.370
I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love;

818
00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:03.430
wherein, by the colour of his beard,

819
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:04.830
the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait,

820
00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:06.670
the expressure of his eye, forehead, and complexion,

821
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:11.030
he shall find himself most feelingly personated.

822
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:14.200
I can write very like my lady your niece:

823
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.300
on a forgotten matter

824
00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.500
we can hardly make distinction of our hands.

825
00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:18.800
Excellent! I smell a device.

826
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.630
I have't in my nose too.

827
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:23.470
He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,

828
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:24.400
that they come from my niece,

829
00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.870
and that she's in love with him.

830
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:27.800
My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.

831
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.100
And your horse now would make him an ass.

832
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.500

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:38.630
I know my physic will work with him. I will plant you two,

836
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.930
and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the letter:

837
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:43.830
observe his construction of it.

838
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:48.230

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:04.330
what o' that?

843
00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:08.770
I was adored once too.

If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.

846
00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:26.530
Send for money, knight: if thou hast her not i' the end,

847
00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:30.230
call me cut.

848
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:36.170
If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.

849
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:41.830
Come, come, I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late

850
00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:47.700

Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,

That old and antique song we heard last night:

861
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.970
Methought it did relieve my passion much,

862
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:07.530
More than light airs and recollected terms

863
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:09.430
Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:

He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.

866
00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.230
Who was it?

867
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:15.900
Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady

868
00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:17.970
Olivia's father took much delight in.

869
00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:19.100
He is about the house. Seek him out,

870
00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:22.300
and play the tune the while.

871
00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:27.000
Come hither, boy:

872
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.030
(♪Music plays)

873
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:31.330
if ever thou shalt love,

874
00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:33.670
In the sweet pangs of it remember me;

875
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:36.900
For such as I am all true lovers are,

876
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.200
Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,

877
00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:41.400
Save in the constant image of the creature

878
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:47.670
That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?

879
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:49.630
It gives a very echo to the seat

880
00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:51.900
Where Love is throned.

881
00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:53.870
Thou dost speak masterly:

882
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:55.270
My life upon't, young though thou art,

883
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:57.600
thine eye Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:

884
00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.570
Hath it not, boy?

885
00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:03.170
A little, by your favour.

886
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:03.970
What kind of woman is't?

887
00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:05.300
Of your complexion.

888
00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.570
She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?

889
00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:10.770
About your years, my lord.

890
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.800
Too old by heaven: let still the woman take

891
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.500
An elder than herself: so wears she to him,

892
00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.570
So sways she level in her husband's heart:

893
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:22.370
For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,

894
00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:25.270
Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,

895
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:28.500
More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,

896
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.370
Than women's are.

897
00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:30.830
I think it well, my lord.

898
00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:33.700
Then let thy love be younger than thyself,

899
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:37.370
Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;

900
00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:40.300
For women are as roses, whose fair flower

901
00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.900
Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.

902
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:46.430
And so they are: alas, that they are so;

903
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:50.000
To die, even when they to perfection grow!

904
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.770
O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.

905
00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:55.900
Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;

906
00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.700
The spinsters and the knitters in the sun

907
00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.870
And the free maids that weave their thread with bones

908
00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:03.930
Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,

909
00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:06.500
And dallies with the innocence of love,

910
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:09.530
Like the old age.

911
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:10.970
Are you ready, sir?

912
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:15.270
Ay; prithee, sing.

913
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:16.270
(♪SONG)

914
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:20.470
Come away, come away, death,

915
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:29.270
And in sad cypress let me be laid;

916
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:34.930
Fly away, fly away breath;

917
00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:41.870
I am slain by a fair cruel maid.

918
00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:50.000
My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,

919
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:56.030
O, prepare it!

920
00:48:56.030 --> 00:49:03.170
My part of death, no one so true

921
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:13.630
No one, no one, Did share it.

922
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:18.870
Not a flower, not a flower sweet

923
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:27.930
On my black coffin let there be strown;

924
00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:33.200
Not a friend, not a friend greet

925
00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:42.200
My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:

926
00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:48.700
A thousand thousand sighs to save,

927
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:55.430
Lay me, O, where

928
00:49:55.430 --> 00:50:02.130
Sad true lover never find my grave,

929
00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:12.070
To weep there! ♪

930
00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:17.530
There's for thy pains.

931
00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:20.730
No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.

932
00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:22.570
I'll pay thy pleasure then.

933
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:26.600
Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.

934
00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.870
Give me now leave to leave thee.

935
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:32.270
Now, the melancholy god protect thee;

936
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:35.000
and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta,

937
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.700
for thy mind is a very opal.

938
00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:39.600
I would have men of such constancy put to sea,

939
00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:41.100
that their business might be every thing

940
00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.970
and their intent every where;

941
00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:48.570
for that's it that always makes a good voyage of nothing.

942
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:56.000
Farewell. Let all the rest give place.

943
00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:04.770
Once more, Cesario,

944
00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:07.700
Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:

945
00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:09.500
Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,

946
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.630
Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;

947
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:14.470
The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,

948
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:18.030
Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;

949
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:19.930
But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems

950
00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:22.170
That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.

951
00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:24.670
But if she cannot love you, sir?

952
00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:25.930
I cannot be so answer'd.

953
00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:30.070
Sooth, but you must.

954
00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:35.530
Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,

955
00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:37.900
Hath for your love a great a pang of heart

956
00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:40.630
As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;

957
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:43.370
You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?

958
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:44.500
There is no woman's sides

959
00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.270
Can bide the beating of so strong a passion

960
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:49.270
As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart

961
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:53.370
So big, to hold so much; they lack retention

962
00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:56.070
Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,

963
00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:58.670
No motion of the liver, but the palate,

964
00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:03.830
That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;

965
00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:07.630
But mine is all as hungry as the sea,

966
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:12.000
And can digest as much: make no compare

967
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.100
Between that love a woman can bear me

968
00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.230
And that I owe Olivia.

969
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:18.830
Ay, but I know--

970
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:19.700
What dost thou know?

971
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.730
Too well what love women to men may owe:

972
00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:28.270
In faith, they are as true of heart as we.

973
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:30.270
My father had a daughter loved a man,

974
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:34.130
As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,

975
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:36.230
I should your lordship.

976
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:37.900
And what's her history?

977
00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:43.000
A blank, my lord. She never told her love,

978
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.730
But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,

979
00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:50.730
Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,

980
00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:52.500
And with a green and yellow melancholy

981
00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:56.030
She sat like patience on a monument,

982
00:52:56.030 --> 00:53:01.670
Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?

983
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:05.170
We men may say more, swear more: but indeed

984
00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:07.200
Our shows are more than will; for still we prove

985
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:11.770
Much in our vows, but little in our love.

986
00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:14.700
But died thy sister of her love, my boy?

987
00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:17.630
I am all the daughters of my father's house,

988
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:24.170
And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.

989
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:27.900
Sir, shall I to this lady?

990
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.500
Ay, that's the theme.

991
00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:34.400
To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,

992
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:44.530
My love can give no place, bide no denay.

993
00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:46.500


994
00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:50.100
Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.

995
00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:53.130
Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,

996
00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:55.270
let me be boiled to death with melancholy.

997
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:56.900
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly

998
00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.900
rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?

999
00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:01.800
I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o'

1000
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.930
favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.

1001
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:05.830
To anger him we'll have the bear again;

1002
00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:09.030
and we will fool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?

1003
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:11.000
An we do not, it is pity of our lives.

1004
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.730
Here comes the little villain.

1005
00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:15.170
How now, my metal of India!

1006
00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:16.930
Get ye all three into the box-tree:

1007
00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:18.970
Malvolio's coming down this walk:

1008
00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:20.100
he has been yonder i' the sun

1009
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.270
practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour:

1010
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:24.130
observe him, for the love of mockery;

1011
00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:26.570
for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him.

1012
00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:32.970
Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,

1013
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:35.630
for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.

1014
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:48.870
'Tis but fortune; all is fortune.

1015
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:51.970
Maria once told me she did affect me:

1016
00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:53.800
and I have heard herself come thus near,

1017
00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.330
that, should she fancy, it should be one

1018
00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:59.670
of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more

1019
00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:04.000
exalted respect than any one else that follows her.

1020
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.770
What should I think on't?

1021
00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:07.500
Here's an overweening rogue!

1022
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:10.800
O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him:

1023
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:12.300
how he jets under his advanced plumes!

1024
00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:14.270
'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!

1025
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:16.670
Peace, I say.

1026
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:18.370
To be Count Malvolio!

1027
00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:18.930
Ah, rogue!

1028
00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:19.570
Pistol him, pistol him.

1029
00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:21.100
Peace, peace!

1030
00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:23.600
There is example for't; the lady of the Strachy

1031
00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.970
married the yeoman of the wardrobe.

1032
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:27.000
Fie on him, Jezebel!

1033
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.430
O, peace!

1034
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.600
now he's deeply in: look how imagination blows him.

1035
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:39.030
Having been three months married to her,

1036
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:40.930
sitting in my state,--

1037
00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:43.330
O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!

1038
00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:47.400
Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet gown;

1039
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.870
having come from a day-bed,

1040
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:52.230
where I have left Olivia sleeping,--

1041
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:53.930
Fire and brimstone!

1042
00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:55.330
O, peace, peace!

1043
00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:57.800
And then to have the humour of state;

1044
00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:00.070
and after a demure travel of regard,

1045
00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:06.500
telling them I know my place as I would they should do theirs,

1046
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:08.570
to for my kinsman Toby,--

1047
00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:10.200
Bolts and shackles!

1048
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.200
O peace, peace, peace! now, now.

1049
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.570
Seven of my people, with an obedient start,

1050
00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:18.870
make out for him: I frown the while;

1051
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:24.570
and perchance wind up watch, or play with my--some rich jewel.

1052
00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:28.970
Toby approaches; courtesies there to me,--

1053
00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:30.200
Shall this fellow live?

1054
00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.600
Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.

1055
00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:35.700
I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar

1056
00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:38.600
smile with an austere regard of control,--

1057
00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:41.030
And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?

1058
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:45.900
Saying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on

1059
00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:48.800
your niece give me this prerogative of speech,'--

1060
00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.800
What, what?

1061
00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:53.770
'You must amend your drunkenness.'

1062
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:55.230
Out, scab!

1063
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:57.500
Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.

1064
00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:59.400
'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with

1065
00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.630
a foolish knight,'--

1066
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:02.030
That's me, I warrant you.

1067
00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:03.300
'One Sir Andrew,'--

1068
00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:07.000
I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.

1069
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.030
What employment have we here?

1070
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:12.070
Now is the woodcock near the gin.

1071
00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:15.270
O, peace! and the spirit of humour intimate reading

1072
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:16.530
aloud to him!

1073
00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:19.300
By my life, this is my lady's hand these be her

1074
00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:22.870
very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her

1075
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:26.230
great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.

1076
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:28.570
Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?

1077
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:33.170
'To the unknown beloved, this, and my good wishes:'

1078
00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:38.200
--her very phrases! By your leave, wax.

1079
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:41.270
Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece,

1080
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:43.570
with which she uses to seal: 'tis my lady.

1081
00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:45.500
To whom should this be?

1082
00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:48.900
This wins him, liver and all.

1083
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:52.000
Jove knows I love: But who?

1084
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:52.900
Lips, do not move;

1085
00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:54.370
No man must know.

1086
00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:56.670
'No man must know.' What follows?

1087
00:57:56.670 --> 00:58:00.930
the numbers altered! 'No man must know:'

1088
00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:03.130
if this should be thee, Malvolio?

1089
00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:05.570
Marry, hang thee, brock!

1090
00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:08.300
I may command where I adore;

1091
00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:11.000
But silence, like a Lucrece knife,

1092
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:

1093
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.870
M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.

1094
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:20.500
A fustian riddle!

1095
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.400
Excellent wench, say I.

1096
00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:27.030
'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.'

1097
00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:31.170
Nay, but first, let me see, let me see, let me see.

1098
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.230
What dish o' poison has she dressed him!

1099
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:36.800
And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!

1100
00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:40.230
'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command me:

1101
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:41.930
I serve her; she is my lady.

1102
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:43.630
Why, this is evident to any formal capacity;

1103
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:47.200
there is no obstruction in this: and the end,

1104
00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.000
--what should that alphabetical position portend?

1105
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.630
If I could make that resemble something in me,

1106
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:54.030
--Softly! M, O, A, I,--

1107
00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:57.070
O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.

1108
00:58:57.070 --> 00:58:58.470
Sowter will cry upon't for all this,

1109
00:58:58.470 --> 00:59:00.270
though it be as rank as a fox.

1110
00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:04.730
M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.

1111
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:05.700
Did not I say he would work it out?

1112
00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.200
the cur is excellent at faults.

1113
00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.670
M,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel;

1114
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:13.100
that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.

1115
00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:15.130
And O shall end, I hope.

1116
00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:17.470
Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!

1117
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:19.830
And then I comes behind.

1118
00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:20.900
Ay, an you had any eye behind you,

1119
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:22.330
you might see more detraction at your heels

1120
00:59:22.330 --> 00:59:24.370
than fortunes before you.

1121
00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:30.800
M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former:

1122
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.370
and yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me,

1123
00:59:32.370 --> 00:59:36.730
for every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!

1124
00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:39.200
here follows prose.

1125
00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:44.600
'If this fall into thy hand, revolve.

1126
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:52.470
In my stars I am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness:

1127
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:54.970
some are born great, some achieve greatness,

1128
00:59:54.970 --> 00:59:58.630
and some have greatness thrust upon 'em.

1129
00:59:58.630 --> 01:00:01.530
Thy Fates open their hands;

1130
01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:02.970
let thy blood and spirit embrace them;

1131
01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:05.930
and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,

1132
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:10.100
cast thy humble slough and appear fresh.

1133
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.530
Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;

1134
01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:15.630
let thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into

1135
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:18.070
the trick of singularity:

1136
01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:20.530
she thus advises thee that sighs for thee.

1137
01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:23.700
Remember who commended thy yellow stockings,

1138
01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.870
and wished to see thee ever cross-gartered:

1139
01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:27.770
I say, remember. Go to, thou art made,

1140
01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:29.600
if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see

1141
01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:32.730
thee a steward still, the fellow of servants,

1142
01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:35.970
and not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.

1143
01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:37.330
She that would alter services with thee,

1144
01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:39.470
THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'

1145
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:41.700
Daylight and champaign discovers not more:

1146
01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:47.270
this is open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,

1147
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:51.300
I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance,

1148
01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:54.030
I will be point-devise the very man.

1149
01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:58.000
I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me;

1150
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.830
for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me.

1151
01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:08.830
She did commend my yellow stockings of late,

1152
01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:11.670
she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;

1153
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:13.700
and in this she manifests herself to my love,

1154
01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:16.930
and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits

1155
01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:20.830
of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy.

1156
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:24.530
I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings,

1157
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:26.770
and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting on.

1158
01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:28.670
Jove and my stars be praised!

1159
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:29.970
Here is yet a postscript.

1160
01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:32.900
'Thou canst not choose but know who I am.

1161
01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:38.830
If thou entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;

1162
01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:40.830
thy smiles become thee well;

1163
01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:42.930
therefore in my presence still smile,

1164
01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:45.630
dear my sweet, I prithee.'

1165
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:49.030
Jove, I thank thee: I will smile;

1166
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:53.600
I will do everything that thou wilt have me.

1167
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:02.070
I will not give my part of this sport for a pension

1168
01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:04.230
of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.

1169
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:06.770
I could marry this wench for this device.

1170
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:07.970
So could I too.

1171
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:10.870
And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.

1172
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:11.770
Nor I neither.

1173
01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.430
Here comes my noble gull-catcher.

1174
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:15.900
Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?

1175
01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.530
Or o' mine either?

1176
01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:19.200
Shall I play my freedom at traytrip,

1177
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.300
and become thy bond-slave?

1178
01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.430
I' faith, or I either?

1179
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:23.130
Why, thou hast put him in such a dream,

1180
01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:26.030
that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad.

1181
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:27.530
Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?

1182
01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:30.370
Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.

1183
01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:32.870
If you will then see the fruits of the sport,

1184
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:35.300
mark his first approach before my lady:

1185
01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.130
he will come to her in yellow stockings,

1186
01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:39.970
and 'tis a colour she abhors, and cross-gartered,

1187
01:02:39.970 --> 01:02:44.270
a fashion she detests; and he will smile upon her,

1188
01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:46.000
which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition,

1189
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.100
being addicted to a melancholy as she is,

1190
01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:52.030
that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt.

1191
01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:55.030
If you will see it, follow me.

1192
01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:56.100
To the gates of Tartar,

1193
01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.500
thou most excellent devil of wit!

1194
01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:01.000
I'll make one too.

1195
01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:13.700
(♪ music plays)

1196
01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.170
Save thee, friend, and thy music:

1197
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:16.830
dost thou live by thy tabour?

1198
01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:18.200
No, sir, I live by the church.

1199
01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.370
Art thou a churchman?

1200
01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:21.300
No such matter, sir: I do live by the church;

1201
01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:22.830
for I do live at my house,

1202
01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:24.600
and my house doth stand by the church.

1203
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.430
Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?

1204
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:29.100
No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly:

1205
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:31.670
she will keep no fool, sir, till she be married;

1206
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:34.770
and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings;

1207
01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:37.300
the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not her fool,

1208
01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.400
but her corrupter of words.

1209
01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.670
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.

1210
01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:44.270
Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,

1211
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:46.700
it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir,

1212
01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.270
but the fool should be as oft

1213
01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:49.970
with your master as with my mistress:

1214
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:51.430
I think I saw your wisdom there.

1215
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:53.870
Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.

1216
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:58.100
Hold, there's expenses for thee.

1217
01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:00.570
Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair,

1218
01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.630
send thee a beard!

1219
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:05.370
By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for one;

1220
01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:09.030
though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy lady within?

1221
01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:11.470
Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?

1222
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:13.870
Yes, being kept together and put to use.

1223
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:16.070
I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir,

1224
01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:18.000
to bring a Cressida to this Troilus.

1225
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.630
I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.

1226
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:23.330
The matter, I hope, is not great, sir,

1227
01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:27.700
begging but a beggar: Cressida was a beggar.

1228
01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.470
My lady is within, sir.

1229
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:31.730
I will construe to them whence you come;

1230
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:35.030
who you are and what you would are out of my welkin,

1231
01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:39.030
I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.

1232
01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:41.830
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;

1233
01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:45.600
And to do that well craves a kind of wit:

1234
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.570
He must observe their mood on whom he jests,

1235
01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:52.170
The quality of persons, and the time,

1236
01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:54.100
And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather

1237
01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:57.070
That comes before his eye. This is a practise

1238
01:04:57.070 --> 01:05:01.100
As full of labour as a wise man's art

1239
01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:03.670
For folly that he wisely shows is fit;

1240
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:07.630
But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.

1241
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:10.200
Save you, gentleman.

1242
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.670
And you, sir.

1243
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:12.770
Dieu vous garde, monsieur.

1244
01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:14.800
Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.

1245
01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.970
I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.

1246
01:05:17.970 --> 01:05:22.070
Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous

1247
01:05:22.070 --> 01:05:24.200
you should enter, if your trade be to her.

1248
01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.170
I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the

1249
01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:29.470
list of my voyage.

1250
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:31.630
Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.

1251
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:34.130
My legs do better understand me, sir, than I

1252
01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:36.570
understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.

1253
01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:37.830
I mean, to go, sir, to enter.

1254
01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:40.730
I will answer you with gait and entrance.

1255
01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.930
Most excellent accomplished lady,

1256
01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:47.300
the heavens rain odours on you!

1257
01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.930
That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours;' well.

1258
01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:52.300
My matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnant

1259
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.000
and vouchsafed ear.

1260
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.500
'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:'

1261
01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:56.900
I'll get 'em all three all ready.

1262
01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.530
Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.

1263
01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:09.730
Give me your hand, sir.

1264
01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:12.170
My duty, madam, and most humble service.

1265
01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:13.230
What is your name?

1266
01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:16.000
Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.

1267
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.930
My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world

1268
01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:21.800
Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:

1269
01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.500
You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.

1270
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.330
And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:

1271
01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:28.300
Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.

1272
01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.400
For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,

1273
01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.170
Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!

1274
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:34.600
Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts

1275
01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.600
On his behalf.

1276
01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.130
O, by your leave, I pray you,

1277
01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:41.300
I bade you never speak again of him:

1278
01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.700
But, would you undertake another suit,

1279
01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.600
I had rather hear you to solicit that

1280
01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.630
Than music from the spheres.

1281
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:48.500
Dear lady,--

1282
01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.870
Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,

1283
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:52.900
After the last enchantment you did here,

1284
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:55.600
A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse

1285
01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.570
Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:

1286
01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:02.430
Under your hard construction must I sit,

1287
01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:04.500
To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,

1288
01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:09.100
Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?

1289
01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:11.470
Have you not set mine honour at the stake

1290
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:13.300
And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts

1291
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:17.170
That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving

1292
01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:20.470
Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,

1293
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:26.000
Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.

1294
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.230
I pity you.

1295
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:28.400
That's a degree to love.

1296
01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.870
No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,

1297
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:33.970
That very oft we pity enemies.

1298
01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:37.730
Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.

1299
01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:42.200
O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!

1300
01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.270
If one should be a prey, how much the better

1301
01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:46.800
To fall before the lion than the wolf!

1302
01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.100
(Clock strikes)

1303
01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:51.600
The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.

1304
01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.230
Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:

1305
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:58.300
And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,

1306
01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:02.430
Your were is alike to reap a proper man:

1307
01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:04.970
There lies your way, due west.

1308
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:08.300
Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition

1309
01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:10.500
Attend your ladyship!

1310
01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:18.000
You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?

1311
01:08:20.730 --> 01:08:24.200
Stay:

1312
01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:28.700
I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.

1313
01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.830
That you do think you are not what you are.

1314
01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:32.330
If I think so, I think the same of you.

1315
01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:34.130
Then think you right: I am not what I am.

1316
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:35.770
I would you were as I would have you be!

1317
01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:37.370
Would it be better, madam, than I am?

1318
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:41.430
I wish it might, for now I am your fool.

1319
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:44.370
O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful

1320
01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:47.430
In the contempt and anger of his lip!

1321
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:49.800
A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon

1322
01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:54.730
Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.

1323
01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:59.030
Cesario, by the roses of the spring,

1324
01:08:59.030 --> 01:09:03.500
By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,

1325
01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:07.830
I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,

1326
01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:11.270
Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.

1327
01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:13.000
Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,

1328
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.430
For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,

1329
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:19.870
But rather reason thus with reason fetter,

1330
01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:24.900
Love sought is good, but given unsought better.

1331
01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:27.930
By innocence I swear, and by my youth

1332
01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:31.500
I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,

1333
01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.470
And that no woman has; nor never none

1334
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:39.100
Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.

1335
01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:42.100
And so adieu, good madam: never more

1336
01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:46.200
Will I my master's tears to you deplore.

1337
01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:50.030
Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move

1338
01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:56.230
That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.

1339
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:12.700
No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.

1340
01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:16.100
Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.

1341
01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:18.000
You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.

1342
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.830
Marry, I saw your niece do more favours

1343
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:22.000
to the count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;

1344
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.600
Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.

1345
01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.730
As plain as I see you now.

1346
01:10:26.730 --> 01:10:29.230
This was a great argument of love in her toward you.

1347
01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:31.000
'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?

1348
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.470
I will prove it legitimate, sir,

1349
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:33.900
upon the oaths of judgment and reason.

1350
01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:36.170
And they have been grand-jury-men

1351
01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:37.570
since before Noah was a sailor.

1352
01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:39.570
She did show favour to the youth in your sight only

1353
01:10:39.570 --> 01:10:43.330
to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour,

1354
01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:46.930
to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.

1355
01:10:46.930 --> 01:10:48.430
You should then have accosted her;

1356
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:50.830
and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint,

1357
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:53.770
you should have banged the youth into dumbness.

1358
01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:57.470
This was looked for at your hand, and this was balked:

1359
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:58.600
the double gilt of this opportunity

1360
01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.530
you let time wash off,

1361
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:02.870
and you are now sailed into the north of my lady's opinion;

1362
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:04.600
where you will hang like an icicle

1363
01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:05.900
on a Dutchman's beard,

1364
01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.570
unless you do redeem it

1365
01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:10.570
by some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.

1366
01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:12.170
An't be any way, it must be with valour;

1367
01:11:12.170 --> 01:11:13.370
for policy I hate:

1368
01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:16.000
Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour.

1369
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.700
Challenge me the count's youth to fight with him;

1370
01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:21.830
hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall take note of it;

1371
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:23.830
and assure thyself, there is no love-broker in the world

1372
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:27.330
can more prevail in man's commendation with woman

1373
01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:29.330
than report of valour.

1374
01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:33.770
There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.

1375
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:35.800
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?

1376
01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:40.170
Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;

1377
01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:43.000
it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun

1378
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.970
of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:

1379
01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:47.870
if thou thou'st him some thrice,

1380
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:49.300
it shall not be amiss;

1381
01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:52.300
and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper,

1382
01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.570
although the sheet were big enough

1383
01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:57.400
for the bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.

1384
01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.900
Let there be gall enough in thy ink,

1385
01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:02.870
though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.

1386
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:05.470
Where shall I find you?

1387
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:09.830
We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.

1388
01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:14.700
This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.

1389
01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.270
I have been dear to him, lad,

1390
01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:18.500
some two thousand strong, or so.

1391
01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:21.800
We shall have a rare letter from him:

1392
01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:22.730
but you'll not deliver't?

1393
01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:24.500
Never trust me, then;

1394
01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:28.230
and by all means stir on the youth to an answer.

1395
01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:29.800
I think oxen and wainropes

1396
01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:34.200
cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were opened,

1397
01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.030
and you find so much blood in his liver

1398
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:38.170
as will clog the foot of a flea,

1399
01:12:38.170 --> 01:12:39.900
I'll eat the rest of the anatomy.

1400
01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:40.970
And his opposite, the youth,

1401
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:42.800
bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty.

1402
01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:47.900
Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes.

1403
01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:49.530
If you desire the spleen,

1404
01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:52.100
and will laugh yourself into stitches, follow me.

1405
01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:55.530
Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very renegado;

1406
01:12:55.530 --> 01:12:56.530
for there is no Christian,

1407
01:12:56.530 --> 01:12:58.330
that means to be saved by believing rightly,

1408
01:12:58.330 --> 01:13:00.900
can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness.

1409
01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:02.870
He's in yellow stockings.

1410
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:04.300
And cross-gartered?

1411
01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:07.070
Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school

1412
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:09.330
i' the church. I have dogged him,

1413
01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:12.500
like his murderer. He does obey every point of the letter

1414
01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.670
that I dropped to betray him:

1415
01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:17.070
he does smile his face into more lines

1416
01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:20.570
than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies:

1417
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:23.230
you have not seen such a thing as 'tis.

1418
01:13:23.230 --> 01:13:26.970
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him.

1419
01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:28.430
I know my lady will strike him:

1420
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:32.800
if she do, he'll smile and take't for a great favour.

1421
01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.470
Come, bring us, bring us where he is.

1422
01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:44.870
I would not by my will have troubled you;

1423
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:46.470
But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,

1424
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:48.270
I will no further chide you.

1425
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:50.100
I could not stay behind you: my desire,

1426
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:53.670
More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;

1427
01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:56.270
And not all love to see you, though so much

1428
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:58.670
As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,

1429
01:13:58.670 --> 01:14:00.400
But jealousy what might befall your travel,

1430
01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.230
Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,

1431
01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:04.230
Unguided and unfriended, often prove

1432
01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:06.970
Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,

1433
01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:09.200
The rather by these arguments of fear,

1434
01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.830
Set forth in your pursuit.

1435
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:12.230
My kind Antonio,

1436
01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:13.770
I can no other answer make but thanks,

1437
01:14:13.770 --> 01:14:17.100
And thanks; and ever thanks oft good turns

1438
01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:19.370
Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:

1439
01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:22.330
But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,

1440
01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:25.500
You should find better dealing.

1441
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:28.500
What's to do?

1442
01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:29.900
Shall we go see the reliques of this town?

1443
01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:32.330
To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.

1444
01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:34.570
I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:

1445
01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:35.930
I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes

1446
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.630
With the memorials and the things of fame

1447
01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:39.330
That do renown this city.

1448
01:14:39.330 --> 01:14:40.570
Would you'ld pardon me;

1449
01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:42.700
I do not without danger walk these streets:

1450
01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:45.000
Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys

1451
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.830
I did some service; of such note indeed,

1452
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:50.270
That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.

1453
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:52.430
Belike you slew great number of his people.

1454
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:54.770
The offence is not of such a bloody nature;

1455
01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:56.170
Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel

1456
01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:59.530
Might well have given us bloody argument.

1457
01:14:59.530 --> 01:15:01.400
It might have since been answer'd in repaying

1458
01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.270
What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,

1459
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:07.000
Most of our city did: only myself stood out;

1460
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.530
For which, if I be lapsed in this place,

1461
01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:09.930
I shall pay dear.

1462
01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:12.770
Do not then walk too open.

1463
01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:19.730
It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.

1464
01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:20.830
In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,

1465
01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:23.030
Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,

1466
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:25.170
Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge

1467
01:15:25.170 --> 01:15:28.130
With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.

1468
01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:29.170
Why I your purse?

1469
01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:30.600
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy

1470
01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.730
You have desire to purchase; and your store,

1471
01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:34.800
I think, is not for idle markets, sir.

1472
01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.530
I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you

1473
01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:38.170
For an hour.

1474
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:40.030
To the Elephant.

1475
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:44.000
I do remember.

1476
01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.470
I have sent after him: he says he'll come;

1477
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:55.530
How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?

1478
01:15:55.530 --> 01:15:59.400
For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.

1479
01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.570
I speak too loud.

1480
01:16:00.570 --> 01:16:02.870
Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,

1481
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:06.070
And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:

1482
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:07.300
Where is Malvolio?

1483
01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:11.000
He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner.

1484
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.070
He is, sure, possessed, madam.

1485
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:14.570
Why, what's the matter? does he rave?

1486
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:16.500
No. madam, he does nothing but smile:

1487
01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.830
your ladyship were best to have some guard about you,

1488
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:21.870
if he come; for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.

1489
01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:27.500
Go call him hither.

1490
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.930
I am as mad as he,

1491
01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:35.370
If sad and merry madness equal be.

1492
01:16:35.370 --> 01:16:39.330
How now, Malvolio!

1493
01:16:39.330 --> 01:16:42.630
Sweet lady, ho, ho.

1494
01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:44.770
Smilest thou?

1495
01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:47.100
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.

1496
01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:50.530
Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some

1497
01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:52.830
obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering;

1498
01:16:52.830 --> 01:16:55.930
but what of that? if it please the eye of one,

1499
01:16:55.930 --> 01:16:58.400
it is with me as the very true sonnet is,

1500
01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.430
'Please one, and please all.'

1501
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:04.670
Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?

1502
01:17:04.670 --> 01:17:09.400
Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs.

1503
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:15.670
It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed:

1504
01:17:15.670 --> 01:17:18.900
I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.

1505
01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:21.600
Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?

1506
01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:27.030
To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.

1507
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:28.930
God comfort thee!

1508
01:17:28.930 --> 01:17:32.300
Why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand so oft?

1509
01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.370
How do you, Malvolio?

1510
01:17:33.370 --> 01:17:36.100
At your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.

1511
01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:37.900
Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness

1512
01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:39.070
before my lady?

1513
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:42.670
'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.

1514
01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:44.400
What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?

1515
01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.570
'Some are born great,'--

1516
01:17:45.570 --> 01:17:46.370
Ha!

1517
01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:47.570
'Some achieve greatness,'--

1518
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:49.030
What sayest thou?

1519
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:52.000
'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'

1520
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.600
Heaven restore thee!

1521
01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.170
'Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s,'--

1522
01:17:56.170 --> 01:17:57.700
Thy yellow stockings!

1523
01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.930
'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'

1524
01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:01.170
Cross-gartered!

1525
01:18:01.170 --> 01:18:04.400
'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'--

1526
01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.030
Am I made?

1527
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:08.570
'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'

1528
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:14.000
Why, this is very midsummer madness.

1529
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.800
Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is returned:

1530
01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.230
I could hardly entreat him back:

1531
01:18:18.230 --> 01:18:20.100
he attends your ladyship's pleasure.

1532
01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:22.770
I'll come to him.

1533
01:18:22.770 --> 01:18:25.500
Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to.

1534
01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:26.570
Where's my cousin Toby?

1535
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:29.430
Let some of my people have a special care of him:

1536
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:30.870
I would not have him miscarry

1537
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:33.970
for the half of my dowry.

1538
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:38.530
O, ho! do you come near me now?

1539
01:18:38.530 --> 01:18:42.630
no worse man than Sir Toby to look to me!

1540
01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:45.230
This concurs directly with the letter:

1541
01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:46.170
she sends him on purpose,

1542
01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:47.600
that I may appear stubborn to him;

1543
01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.400
for she incites me to that in the letter.

1544
01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:54.830
'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;

1545
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:57.770
'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;

1546
01:18:57.770 --> 01:19:00.270
let thy tongue tang with arguments of state;

1547
01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:03.030
put thyself into the trick of singularity;'

1548
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:05.130
and consequently sets down the manner how;

1549
01:19:05.130 --> 01:19:09.300
as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue,

1550
01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:14.300
in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth.

1551
01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:18.600
I have limed her; but it is Jove's doing,

1552
01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:25.570
and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now,

1553
01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:29.830
'Let this fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio,

1554
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:33.170
nor after my degree, but fellow.

1555
01:19:33.170 --> 01:19:35.870
Why, every thing adheres together,

1556
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:37.770
that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple,

1557
01:19:37.770 --> 01:19:40.830
no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumsta--

1558
01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:45.500
What can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me

1559
01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:49.570
and the full prospect of my hopes.

1560
01:19:49.570 --> 01:19:52.970
Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this,

1561
01:19:52.970 --> 01:19:54.970
and he is to be thanked.

1562
01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:10.830
Which way is he, in the name of sanctity?

1563
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:12.870
If all the devils of hell be drawn in little,

1564
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:15.600
and Legion himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.

1565
01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:20.100
Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?

1566
01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:22.230
how is't with you, man?

1567
01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:28.570
Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go off.

1568
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:32.200
Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him!

1569
01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.300
did not I tell you?

1570
01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:35.770
Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a care of him.

1571
01:20:35.770 --> 01:20:37.730
Ah, ha! does she so?

1572
01:20:37.730 --> 01:20:42.630
Go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently with him:

1573
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:46.930
let me alone. How do you, Malvolio?

1574
01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:50.100
how is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:

1575
01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:52.170
consider, he's an enemy to mankind.

1576
01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:53.800
Do you know what you say?

1577
01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.600
La you, an you speak ill of the devil,

1578
01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.200
how he takes it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!

1579
01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.300
Carry his water to the wise woman.

1580
01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:02.000
Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I live.

1581
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.100
My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.

1582
01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:06.030
How now, mistress!

1583
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:07.170
O Lord!

1584
01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:09.530
Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way:

1585
01:21:09.530 --> 01:21:12.770
do you not see you move him? let me alone with him.

1586
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:16.630
No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is rough,

1587
01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:21.000
and will not be roughly used.

1588
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.970
Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?

1589
01:21:25.970 --> 01:21:27.030
Sir!

1590
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:28.430
Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby,

1591
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:29.470
get him to pray.

1592
01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:30.870
My prayers, minx!

1593
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:34.800
No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.

1594
01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:39.300
Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow things:

1595
01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:40.730
I am not of your element:

1596
01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:43.370
you shall know more hereafter.

1597
01:21:43.770 --> 01:21:50.130
(laughing)

1598
01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:51.670
Is't possible?

1599
01:21:51.670 --> 01:21:53.830
If this were played upon a stage now,

1600
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:55.770
I could condemn it as an improbable fiction.

1601
01:21:55.770 --> 01:21:59.000
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.

1602
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.770
Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.

1603
01:22:01.770 --> 01:22:03.630
Why, we shall make him mad indeed.

1604
01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:04.770
The house will be the quieter.

1605
01:22:04.770 --> 01:22:09.500
Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound.

1606
01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.330
My niece is already in the belief that he's mad:

1607
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:13.670
we may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,

1608
01:22:13.670 --> 01:22:15.630
till our very pastime, tired out of breath,

1609
01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:17.230
prompt us to have mercy on him:

1610
01:22:17.230 --> 01:22:19.130
at which time we will bring the device to the bar

1611
01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:23.630
and crown thee for a finder of madmen.

1612
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:25.170
But see, but see.

1613
01:22:25.170 --> 01:22:27.100
More matter for a May morning.

1614
01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:28.600
Here's the challenge, read it:

1615
01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.470
warrant there's vinegar and pepper in't.

1616
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:31.470
Is't so saucy?

1617
01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:33.300
Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read.

1618
01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:36.930
Give me.

1619
01:22:36.930 --> 01:22:41.970
'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.'

1620
01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:44.100
Good, and valiant.

1621
01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:47.030
'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,

1622
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:48.670
why I do call thee so,

1623
01:22:48.670 --> 01:22:52.200
for I will show thee no reason for't.'

1624
01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.870
A good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.

1625
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:57.500
'Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my sight

1626
01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:01.070
she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy throat;

1627
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:04.130
that is not the matter I challenge thee for.'

1628
01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:07.400
Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.

1629
01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.900
'I will waylay thee going home;

1630
01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:12.630
where if it be thy chance to kill me,'--

1631
01:23:12.630 --> 01:23:13.730
Good.

1632
01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:15.630
'Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.'

1633
01:23:15.630 --> 01:23:17.430
Still you keep o' the windy side of the law: good.

1634
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:19.900
'Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon

1635
01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:22.330
one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine;

1636
01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:26.230
but my hope is better, and so look to thyself.

1637
01:23:26.230 --> 01:23:29.800
Thy friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,

1638
01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:32.900
ANDREW AGUECHEEK.

1639
01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:35.000
If this letter move him not, his legs cannot:

1640
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.830
I'll give't him.

1641
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:38.130
You may have very fit occasion for't:

1642
01:23:38.130 --> 01:23:39.530
he is now in some commerce with my lady,

1643
01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:40.770
and will by and by depart.

1644
01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:45.970
Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner the orchard

1645
01:23:45.970 --> 01:23:48.670
like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest him,

1646
01:23:48.670 --> 01:23:51.230
draw; and, as thou drawest swear horrible;

1647
01:23:51.230 --> 01:23:53.070
for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath,

1648
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:54.800
with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off,

1649
01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.270
gives manhood more approbation

1650
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:59.200
than ever proof itself would have earned him. Away!

1651
01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:04.030
Nay, let me alone for swearing.

1652
01:24:11.370 --> 01:24:14.930
Now will not I deliver his letter:

1653
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:16.470
for the behavior of the young gentleman

1654
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:19.100
gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding;

1655
01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:21.300
his employment between his lord and my niece

1656
01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:23.000
confirms no less:

1657
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.500
therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant,

1658
01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:26.870
will breed no terror in the youth:

1659
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:30.730
he will find it comes from a clodpole.

1660
01:24:30.730 --> 01:24:35.000
But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth;

1661
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.470
set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valour;

1662
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:40.100
and drive the gentleman, as I know his

1663
01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:42.200
youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous

1664
01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:44.530
opinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity.

1665
01:24:44.530 --> 01:24:46.630
This will so fright them both that they will kill

1666
01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:49.870
one another by the look, like cockatrices.

1667
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:58.100
I have said too much unto a heart of stone

1668
01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:01.030
And laid mine honour too unchary out:

1669
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:03.730
There's something in me that reproves my fault;

1670
01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:05.870
But such a headstrong potent fault it is,

1671
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:07.370
That it but mocks reproof.

1672
01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:09.670
With the same 'havior that your passion bears

1673
01:25:09.670 --> 01:25:11.100
Goes on my master's grief.

1674
01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:16.000
Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;

1675
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.070
Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;

1676
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:23.570
And I beseech you come again to-morrow.

1677
01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:25.370
What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,

1678
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:27.170
That honour saved may upon asking give?

1679
01:25:27.170 --> 01:25:29.930
Nothing but this; your true love for my master.

1680
01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:31.830
How with mine honour may I give him that

1681
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:33.200
Which I have given to you?

1682
01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:36.230
I will acquit you.

1683
01:25:36.230 --> 01:25:39.530
Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:

1684
01:25:39.530 --> 01:25:43.500
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.

1685
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:50.770
Gentleman, God save thee.

1686
01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:51.730
And you, sir.

1687
01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:54.530
That defence thou hast, betake thee to't:

1688
01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:57.370
of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not;

1689
01:25:57.370 --> 01:26:00.370
but thy intercepter, full of despite,

1690
01:26:00.370 --> 01:26:03.400
bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:

1691
01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:07.030
dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation,

1692
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:09.600
for thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.

1693
01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:13.170
You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me:

1694
01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:14.330
my remembrance is very free

1695
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:17.000
and clear from any image of offence done to any man.

1696
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.870
You'll find it otherwise, I assure you:

1697
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:20.230
therefore, if you hold your life at any price,

1698
01:26:20.230 --> 01:26:23.370
betake you to your guard; for your opposite hath in him

1699
01:26:23.370 --> 01:26:27.130
what youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.

1700
01:26:27.130 --> 01:26:28.470
I pray you, sir, what is he?

1701
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:32.330
He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier

1702
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:37.230
and on carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private brawl:

1703
01:26:37.230 --> 01:26:39.600
souls and bodies hath he divorced three;

1704
01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:42.100
and his incensement at this moment is so implacable,

1705
01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:44.330
that satisfaction can be none

1706
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:46.700
but by pangs of death and sepulchre.

1707
01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:51.700
Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.

1708
01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:52.930
I will return again into the house

1709
01:26:52.930 --> 01:26:56.900
and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter.

1710
01:26:58.970 --> 01:27:00.600
I have heard of some kind of men

1711
01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:04.170
that put quarrels purposely on others, to taste their valour:

1712
01:27:04.170 --> 01:27:06.430
belike this is a man of that quirk.

1713
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:07.700
Sir, no;

1714
01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:09.870
his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury:

1715
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:12.870
therefore, get you on and give him his desire.

1716
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:14.270
Back you shall not to the house,

1717
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:16.330
unless you undertake that with me

1718
01:27:16.330 --> 01:27:19.630
which with as much safety you might answer him:

1719
01:27:19.630 --> 01:27:23.300
therefore, on, or strip your sword stark naked;

1720
01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:24.730
for meddle you must, that's certain,

1721
01:27:24.730 --> 01:27:27.130
or forswear to wear iron about you.

1722
01:27:27.130 --> 01:27:30.770
This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you,

1723
01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:33.100
do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight

1724
01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:35.430
what my offence to him is: it is something of my

1725
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:38.970
negligence, nothing of my purpose.

1726
01:27:38.970 --> 01:27:44.100
I will do so.

1727
01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:51.230
Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return.

1728
01:28:05.170 --> 01:28:09.300
Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?

1729
01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:13.500
I know the knight is incensed against you,

1730
01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:14.830
even to a mortal arbitrement;

1731
01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:18.030
but nothing of the circumstance more.

1732
01:28:18.030 --> 01:28:22.630
I beseech you, what manner of man is he?

1733
01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:24.670
Nothing of that wonderful promise,

1734
01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:25.870
to read him by his form,

1735
01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:29.430
as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour.

1736
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:31.300
He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,

1737
01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:34.330
bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly

1738
01:28:34.330 --> 01:28:37.600
have found in any part of Illyria.

1739
01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.100
Will you walk towards him?

1740
01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:40.830
I will make your peace with him if I can.

1741
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:43.030
I shall be much bound to you for't:

1742
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:46.270
I am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight:

1743
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:49.500
I care not who knows so much of my mettle.

1744
01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:53.100
Why, man, he's a very devil;

1745
01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:54.270
I have not seen such a firago.

1746
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:56.330
I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and all,

1747
01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:58.800
and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion,

1748
01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.230
that it is inevitable; and on the answer,

1749
01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:04.070
he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground

1750
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:05.530
they step on.

1751
01:29:05.530 --> 01:29:07.870
They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.

1752
01:29:07.870 --> 01:29:09.170
Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.

1753
01:29:09.170 --> 01:29:11.330
Ay, but he will not now be pacified:

1754
01:29:11.330 --> 01:29:13.230
Fabian can scarce hold him yonder.

1755
01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:14.600
Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant

1756
01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:15.870
and so cunning in fence,

1757
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:17.600
I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ld have challenged him.

1758
01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.830
Let him let the matter slip,

1759
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:21.400
and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.

1760
01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:28.570
I'll make the motion:

1761
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:36.370
stand here, make a good show on't:

1762
01:29:36.370 --> 01:29:39.230
this shall end without the perdition of souls.

1763
01:29:39.230 --> 01:29:41.700
Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.

1764
01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:44.130
I have his horse to take up the quarrel:

1765
01:29:44.130 --> 01:29:47.100
I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.

1766
01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:48.300
He is as horribly conceited of him;

1767
01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:51.430
and pants and looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.

1768
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:53.330
There's no remedy, sir;

1769
01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:55.170
he will fight with you for's oath sake:

1770
01:29:55.170 --> 01:29:56.930
marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel,

1771
01:29:56.930 --> 01:30:00.800
and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of:

1772
01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:04.330
therefore draw, for the supportance of his vow;

1773
01:30:04.330 --> 01:30:06.930
he protests he will not hurt you.

1774
01:30:06.930 --> 01:30:09.930
Pray God defend me! A little thing would

1775
01:30:09.930 --> 01:30:12.330
make me tell them how much I lack of a man.

1776
01:30:12.330 --> 01:30:16.200
Give ground, if you see him furious.

1777
01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.200
Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy;

1778
01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:19.370
the gentleman will,

1779
01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:21.430
for his honour's sake, have one bout with you;

1780
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:23.430
he cannot by the duello avoid it:

1781
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:25.500
but he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier,

1782
01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:29.500
he will not hurt you. Come on; to't.

1783
01:30:29.730 --> 01:30:31.830
Pray God, he keep his oath!

1784
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:36.200
I do assure you, 'tis against my will.

1785
01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:04.130
Put up your sword. If this young gentleman

1786
01:31:04.130 --> 01:31:06.330
Have done offence, I take the fault on me:

1787
01:31:06.330 --> 01:31:08.270
If you offend him, I for him defy you.

1788
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:10.200
You, sir! why, what are you?

1789
01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:12.000
One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more

1790
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.970
Than you have heard him brag to you he will.

1791
01:31:13.970 --> 01:31:18.900
Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.

1792
01:31:27.670 --> 01:31:30.430
O good Sir Toby, hold! here come the officers.

1793
01:31:30.430 --> 01:31:33.030
I'll be with you anon.

1794
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:34.930
Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.

1795
01:31:34.930 --> 01:31:36.670
Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you,

1796
01:31:36.670 --> 01:31:37.930
I'll be as good as my word:

1797
01:31:37.930 --> 01:31:39.170
he will bear you easily and reins well.

1798
01:31:39.170 --> 01:31:44.530
This is the man; do thy office.

1799
01:31:44.530 --> 01:31:47.230
Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.

1800
01:31:47.230 --> 01:31:48.300
You do mistake me, sir.

1801
01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:50.400
No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,

1802
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.430
Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.

1803
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:54.570
Take him away: he knows I know him well.

1804
01:31:54.570 --> 01:31:58.830
I must obey.

1805
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:03.070
This comes with seeking you:

1806
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:06.030
But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.

1807
01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:06.970
What will you do, now my necessity

1808
01:32:06.970 --> 01:32:09.300
Makes me to ask you for my purse?

1809
01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:11.730
It grieves me Much more for what I cannot do for you

1810
01:32:11.730 --> 01:32:14.530
Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;

1811
01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:17.030
But be of comfort.

1812
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:21.200
Come, sir, away.

1813
01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:24.000
I must entreat of you some of that money.

1814
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.300
What money, sir?

1815
01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:28.330
For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,

1816
01:32:28.330 --> 01:32:30.700
And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,

1817
01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:32.200
Out of my lean and low ability

1818
01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:34.300
I'll lend you something: my having is not much;

1819
01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:37.130
I'll make division of my present with you:

1820
01:32:37.130 --> 01:32:40.370
Hold, there's half my coffer.

1821
01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:42.570
Will you deny me now?

1822
01:32:42.570 --> 01:32:43.870
Is't possible that my deserts to you

1823
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:46.700
Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,

1824
01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:48.000
Lest that it make me so unsound a man

1825
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.670
As to upbraid you with those kindnesses

1826
01:32:49.670 --> 01:32:50.770
That I have done for you.

1827
01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:52.100
I know of none;

1828
01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:55.230
Nor know I you by voice or any feature:

1829
01:32:55.230 --> 01:32:56.870
I hate ingratitude more in a man

1830
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:59.400
Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,

1831
01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.630
Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption

1832
01:33:01.630 --> 01:33:04.100
Inhabits our frail blood.

1833
01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:06.670
O heavens themselves!

1834
01:33:06.670 --> 01:33:08.130
Come, sir, I pray you, go.

1835
01:33:08.130 --> 01:33:11.300
Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here

1836
01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:13.930
I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,

1837
01:33:13.930 --> 01:33:16.970
Relieved him with such sanctity of love,

1838
01:33:16.970 --> 01:33:18.700
And to his image, which methought did promise

1839
01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:22.830
Most venerable worth, did I devotion.

1840
01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:25.330
What's that to us? The time goes by: away!

1841
01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:28.970
But O how vile an idol proves this god

1842
01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:33.500
Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.

1843
01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.900
In nature there's no blemish but the mind;

1844
01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:39.700
None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:

1845
01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:43.000
Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil

1846
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.770
Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.

1847
01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:48.030
The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.

1848
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:51.830
Lead me on.

1849
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:54.530
Methinks his words do from such passion fly,

1850
01:33:54.530 --> 01:33:57.630
That he believes himself: so do not I.

1851
01:33:57.630 --> 01:34:01.330
Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,

1852
01:34:01.330 --> 01:34:04.170
That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!

1853
01:34:04.170 --> 01:34:06.070
Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian:

1854
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:10.070
He named Sebastian: I my brother know

1855
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:13.000
Yet living in my glass; even such and so

1856
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.900
In favour was my brother, and he went

1857
01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:16.470
Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,

1858
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:21.400
For him I imitate: O, if it prove,

1859
01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:27.830
Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.

1860
01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:33.770
A very dishonest paltry boy,

1861
01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:35.330
and more a coward than a hare:

1862
01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:36.570
his dishonesty appears in leaving his

1863
01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:38.730
friend here in necessity and denying him;

1864
01:34:38.730 --> 01:34:40.800
and for his cowardship, ask Fabian.

1865
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:44.530
A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.

1866
01:34:44.530 --> 01:34:46.530
'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.

1867
01:34:46.530 --> 01:34:50.330
Do; cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.

1868
01:34:50.330 --> 01:34:51.500
An I do not,--

1869
01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:52.530
Come, let's see the event.

1870
01:34:52.530 --> 01:34:59.830
I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.

1871
01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:04.300
Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?

1872
01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:06.670
Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow:

1873
01:35:06.670 --> 01:35:09.470
Let me be clear of thee.

1874
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:14.270
Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you;

1875
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:16.200
nor I am not sent to you by my lady,

1876
01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:18.500
to bid you come speak with her;

1877
01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:20.800
nor your name is not Master Cesario;

1878
01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.930
nor this is not my nose neither.

1879
01:35:22.930 --> 01:35:24.770
Nothing that is so is so.

1880
01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:26.530
I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else:

1881
01:35:26.530 --> 01:35:28.030
Thou know'st not me.

1882
01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:29.970
Vent my folly! he has heard that word

1883
01:35:29.970 --> 01:35:32.600
of some great man and now applies it to a fool.

1884
01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:35.470
Vent my folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world,

1885
01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:38.830
will prove a cockney. I prithee now,

1886
01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:41.500
ungird thy strangeness

1887
01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:44.230
and tell me what I shall vent to my lady:

1888
01:35:44.230 --> 01:35:45.630
shall I vent to her that thou art coming?

1889
01:35:45.630 --> 01:35:46.870
I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me:

1890
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:49.430
There's money for thee: if you tarry longer,

1891
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:50.670
I shall give worse payment.

1892
01:35:50.670 --> 01:35:52.830
By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men

1893
01:35:52.830 --> 01:35:55.000
that give fools money get themselves a good report--

1894
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.570
after fourteen years' purchase.

1895
01:35:56.570 --> 01:36:04.830
Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you.

1896
01:36:04.830 --> 01:36:07.570
Why, there's for thee, and there, and there.

1897
01:36:07.570 --> 01:36:09.000
Are all the people mad?

1898
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.570
Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.

1899
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:13.070
This will I tell my lady straight:

1900
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:15.130
I would not be in some of your coats for two pence.

1901
01:36:15.130 --> 01:36:16.400
Come on, sir; hold.

1902
01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:17.870
Nay, let him alone: I'll go another way to work with him;

1903
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:19.470
I'll have an action of battery against him,

1904
01:36:19.470 --> 01:36:20.800
if there be any law in Illyria:

1905
01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:22.270
though I struck him first, yet it's no matter for that.

1906
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:23.500
Let go thy hand.

1907
01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:25.870
Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier,

1908
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:29.630
put up your iron: you are well fleshed; come on.

1909
01:36:29.630 --> 01:36:34.370
I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now?

1910
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:36.770
If thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.

1911
01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:39.030
What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two

1912
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:44.070
of this malapert blood from you.

1913
01:37:06.170 --> 01:37:08.500
Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!

1914
01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:09.970
Madam!

1915
01:37:09.970 --> 01:37:11.770
Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,

1916
01:37:11.770 --> 01:37:13.630
Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,

1917
01:37:13.630 --> 01:37:16.200
Where manners ne'er were preach'd! out of my sight!

1918
01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:18.700
Be not offended, dear Cesario.

1919
01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:21.900
Rudesby, be gone!

1920
01:37:31.730 --> 01:37:32.670
I prithee, gentle friend,

1921
01:37:32.670 --> 01:37:34.370
Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway

1922
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:36.400
In this uncivil and thou unjust extent

1923
01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:38.870
Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,

1924
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:41.300
And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks

1925
01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:44.030
This ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby

1926
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:46.770
Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go:

1927
01:37:46.770 --> 01:37:51.000
Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,

1928
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.730
He started one poor heart of mine in thee.

1929
01:37:53.730 --> 01:37:58.030
What relish is in this? how runs the stream?

1930
01:37:58.030 --> 01:38:01.870
Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:

1931
01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:06.100
Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;

1932
01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:11.570
If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!

1933
01:38:11.570 --> 01:38:15.670
Nay, come, I prithee; would thou'ldst be ruled by me!

1934
01:38:15.670 --> 01:38:17.530
Madam, I will.

1935
01:38:17.530 --> 01:38:23.200
O, say so, and so be!

1936
01:38:32.370 --> 01:38:39.800
Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard;

1937
01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:43.700
make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate:

1938
01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:47.700
do it quickly; I'll call Sir Toby the whilst.

1939
01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:52.000
Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself in't;

1940
01:38:52.230 --> 01:38:53.730
and I would I were the first that ever

1941
01:38:53.730 --> 01:38:58.330
dissembled in such a gown. The competitors enter.

1942
01:38:58.330 --> 01:39:00.970
Jove bless thee, master Parson.

1943
01:39:00.970 --> 01:39:04.370
Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit of Prague,

1944
01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:06.200
that never saw pen and ink,

1945
01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:08.800
very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc,

1946
01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:09.970
'That that is is;'

1947
01:39:09.970 --> 01:39:15.800
so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson;

1948
01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:18.170
for, what is 'that' but 'that,' and 'is' but 'is'?

1949
01:39:18.170 --> 01:39:21.430
To him, Sir Topas.

1950
01:39:26.970 --> 01:39:31.770
What, ho, I say! peace in this prison!

1951
01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:33.730
The knave counterfeits well; a good knave.

1952
01:39:33.730 --> 01:39:35.000
Who calls there?

1953
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.170
Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic.

1954
01:39:39.170 --> 01:39:43.430
Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.

1955
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:48.030
Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man!

1956
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:50.330
talkest thou nothing but of ladies?

1957
01:39:50.330 --> 01:39:52.300
Well said, Master Parson.

1958
01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:54.600
Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged:

1959
01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:57.200
good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad:

1960
01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.670
they have laid me here in hideous darkness.

1961
01:39:59.670 --> 01:40:03.530
Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most

1962
01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:06.700
modest terms; for I am one of those gentle ones

1963
01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:09.170
that will use the devil himself with courtesy:

1964
01:40:09.170 --> 01:40:11.130
sayest thou that house is dark?

1965
01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:13.100
As hell, Sir Topas.

1966
01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:17.670
Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,

1967
01:40:17.670 --> 01:40:19.570
and the clearstores toward the south north

1968
01:40:19.570 --> 01:40:21.300
are as lustrous as ebony;

1969
01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:24.170
and yet complainest thou of obstruction?

1970
01:40:24.170 --> 01:40:28.300
I am not mad, Sir Topas: I say to you, this house is dark.

1971
01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:30.170
Madman, thou errest:

1972
01:40:30.170 --> 01:40:33.900
I say, there is no darkness but ignorance;

1973
01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:35.470
Fare thee well.

1974
01:40:35.470 --> 01:40:38.800
Sir Topas, Sir Topas!

1975
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:43.030
My most exquisite Sir Topas!

1976
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:44.500
Nay, I am for all waters.

1977
01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:46.530
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown:

1978
01:40:46.530 --> 01:40:48.370
he sees thee not.

1979
01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.500
To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how

1980
01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:54.570
thou findest him: I would we were well rid of this knavery.

1981
01:40:54.570 --> 01:40:56.730
If he may be conveniently delivered, I would he were,

1982
01:40:56.730 --> 01:40:59.770
for I am now so far in offence with my niece

1983
01:40:59.770 --> 01:41:02.770
that I cannot pursue with any safety

1984
01:41:02.770 --> 01:41:12.300
this sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.

1985
01:41:19.330 --> 01:41:20.900
[Singing]

1986
01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:22.370
'Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,

1987
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:23.500
Tell me how thy lady does.'

1988
01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:24.570
Fool!

1989
01:41:24.570 --> 01:41:26.330
'My lady is unkind, perdy.'

1990
01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:27.330
Fool!

1991
01:41:27.330 --> 01:41:28.700
'Alas, why is she so?'

1992
01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:30.400
Fool, I say!

1993
01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:32.770
'She loves another'--Who calls, ha?

1994
01:41:32.770 --> 01:41:36.900
Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand,

1995
01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:38.900
help me to a candle, and pen, ink and paper:

1996
01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:45.600
as I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for't.

1997
01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:46.600
Master Malvolio?

1998
01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.930
Ay, good fool.

1999
01:41:48.930 --> 01:41:50.870
Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?

2000
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:53.300
Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused:

2001
01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:55.630
I am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.

2002
01:41:55.630 --> 01:41:57.200
But as well? then you are mad indeed,

2003
01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:59.870
if you be no better in your wits than a fool.

2004
01:41:59.870 --> 01:42:02.630
They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness,

2005
01:42:02.630 --> 01:42:05.730
send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can

2006
01:42:05.730 --> 01:42:07.500
to face me out of my wits.

2007
01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:10.530
Advise you what you say; the minister is here.

2008
01:42:10.530 --> 01:42:13.770
Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore!

2009
01:42:13.770 --> 01:42:17.700
endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain bibble babble.

2010
01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:18.830
Sir Topas!

2011
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:21.430
Maintain no words with him, good fellow.

2012
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:24.070
Who, I, sir? not I, sir. God be wi' you, good Sir Topas.

2013
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:26.870
Merry, amen. I will, sir, I will.

2014
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:28.870
Good fool, some ink, paper and light;

2015
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:31.000
and convey what I will set down to my lady:

2016
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.870
it shall advantage thee more

2017
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:36.870
than ever the bearing of letter did.

2018
01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:48.800
I will help you to't. But tell me true,

2019
01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:51.000
are you not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?

2020
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.600
Believe me, I am not; I tell thee true.

2021
01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:58.800
Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains.

2022
01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.430
I will fetch you light and paper and ink.

2023
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:03.600
Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree:

2024
01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:04.770
I prithee, be gone.

2025
01:43:04.770 --> 01:43:05.570
[Singing]

2026
01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:06.570
I am gone, sir,

2027
01:43:06.570 --> 01:43:07.300
And anon, sir,

2028
01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:09.370
I'll be with you again,

2029
01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:10.000
In a trice,

2030
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.030
Like to the old Vice,

2031
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:13.200
Your need to sustain;

2032
01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.170
Who, with dagger of lath,

2033
01:43:14.170 --> 01:43:15.530
In his rage and his wrath,

2034
01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:16.700
Cries, ah, ha! to the devil:

2035
01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:18.970
Like a mad lad,

2036
01:43:18.970 --> 01:43:20.500
Pare thy nails, dad;

2037
01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:24.000
Adieu, good man devil.

2038
01:43:30.930 --> 01:43:37.870


2039
01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:49.700
This is the air; that is the glorious sun;

2040
01:43:50.630 --> 01:43:55.530
This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;

2041
01:43:55.530 --> 01:43:58.270
And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,

2042
01:43:58.270 --> 01:44:03.700
Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?

2043
01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:04.930
I could not find him at the Elephant:

2044
01:44:04.930 --> 01:44:08.000
Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,

2045
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.470
That he did range the town to seek me out.

2046
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:14.170
His counsel now might do me golden service;

2047
01:44:14.170 --> 01:44:16.870
For though my soul disputes well with my sense,

2048
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:21.500
That this may be some error, but no madness,

2049
01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.930
Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune

2050
01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:27.870
So far exceed all instance, all discourse,

2051
01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:29.400
That I am ready to distrust mine eyes

2052
01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:32.500
And wrangle with my reason that persuades me

2053
01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:37.370
To any other trust but that I am mad

2054
01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:42.430
Or else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,

2055
01:44:42.430 --> 01:44:45.530
She could not sway her house, command her followers,

2056
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:47.500
Take and give back affairs and their dispatch

2057
01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:50.930
With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing

2058
01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:54.170
As I perceive she does: there's something in't

2059
01:44:54.170 --> 01:44:58.230
That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.

2060
01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:06.070
Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,

2061
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:07.870
Now go with me and with this holy man

2062
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:10.600
Into the chantry by: there, before him,

2063
01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:13.700
And underneath that consecrated roof,

2064
01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:16.000
Plight me the full assurance of your faith;

2065
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.670
That my most jealous and too doubtful soul

2066
01:45:18.670 --> 01:45:22.000
May live at peace. He shall conceal it

2067
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.330
Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,

2068
01:45:24.330 --> 01:45:25.700
What time we will our celebration keep

2069
01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:28.270
According to my birth. What do you say?

2070
01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:31.330
I'll follow this good man, and go with you;

2071
01:45:31.330 --> 01:45:35.670
And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.

2072
01:45:35.670 --> 01:45:43.700
Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine,

2073
01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:47.970
That they may fairly note this act of mine!

2074
01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:02.700
Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.

2075
01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:05.300
Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.

2076
01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:06.370
Any thing.

2077
01:46:06.370 --> 01:46:09.170
Do not desire to see this letter.

2078
01:46:09.170 --> 01:46:10.370
This is, to give a dog,

2079
01:46:10.370 --> 01:46:13.670
and in recompense desire my dog again.

2080
01:46:14.170 --> 01:46:16.170
Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?

2081
01:46:16.170 --> 01:46:19.130
Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings.

2082
01:46:19.130 --> 01:46:21.470
I know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?

2083
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:22.800
Truly, sir,

2084
01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:25.930
the better for my foes and the worse for my friends.

2085
01:46:25.930 --> 01:46:27.670
Just the contrary; the better for thy friends.

2086
01:46:27.670 --> 01:46:28.630
No, sir, the worse.

2087
01:46:28.630 --> 01:46:29.830
How can that be?

2088
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:32.430
Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me;

2089
01:46:32.430 --> 01:46:35.130
now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass:

2090
01:46:35.130 --> 01:46:38.930
so that by my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,

2091
01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:41.300
and by my friends, I am abused:

2092
01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:42.400
if you will let your lady know

2093
01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.030
I am here to speak with her,

2094
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:45.470
and bring her along with you,

2095
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:46.730
it may awake my bounty.

2096
01:46:46.730 --> 01:46:49.130
O, lullaby to your bounty till I come again.

2097
01:46:49.130 --> 01:46:50.900
I will awake it soon.

2098
01:46:53.230 --> 01:46:55.570
Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.

2099
01:46:55.570 --> 01:46:59.570
That face of his I do remember well;

2100
01:46:59.570 --> 01:47:01.400
Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd

2101
01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:04.700
As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:

2102
01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:07.100
A bawbling vessel was he captain of,

2103
01:47:07.100 --> 01:47:10.400
For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;

2104
01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:12.170
With which such scathful grapple did he make

2105
01:47:12.170 --> 01:47:14.100
With the most noble bottom of our fleet,

2106
01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:15.930
That very envy and the tongue of loss

2107
01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:19.630
Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?

2108
01:47:19.630 --> 01:47:22.030
Orsino, this is that Antonio

2109
01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:24.470
That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;

2110
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:26.370
And this is he that did the Tiger board,

2111
01:47:26.370 --> 01:47:28.570
When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:

2112
01:47:28.570 --> 01:47:30.400
Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,

2113
01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:32.730
In private brabble did we apprehend him.

2114
01:47:32.730 --> 01:47:34.570
He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;

2115
01:47:34.570 --> 01:47:37.500
But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:

2116
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.470
I know not what 'twas but distraction.

2117
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:42.770
Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!

2118
01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:45.500
What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,

2119
01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:47.770
Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,

2120
01:47:47.770 --> 01:47:50.670
Hast made thine enemies?

2121
01:47:51.630 --> 01:47:53.430
Orsino, noble sir,

2122
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:57.030
Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:

2123
01:47:57.030 --> 01:48:00.330
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,

2124
01:48:00.330 --> 01:48:01.930
Though I confess, on base and ground enough,

2125
01:48:01.930 --> 01:48:07.500
Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:

2126
01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:09.330
That most ingrateful boy there by your side,

2127
01:48:09.330 --> 01:48:11.670
From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth

2128
01:48:11.670 --> 01:48:16.030
Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:

2129
01:48:16.030 --> 01:48:17.600
His life I gave him and did thereto add

2130
01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:19.730
My love, without retention or restraint,

2131
01:48:19.730 --> 01:48:23.730
All his in dedication; for his sake

2132
01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:26.030
Did I expose myself, pure for his love,

2133
01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:29.100
Into the danger of this adverse town;

2134
01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:31.330
Drew to defend him when he was beset:

2135
01:48:31.330 --> 01:48:33.070
Where being apprehended, his false cunning,

2136
01:48:33.070 --> 01:48:35.230
Not meaning to partake with me in danger,

2137
01:48:35.230 --> 01:48:37.500
Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,

2138
01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:39.430
And grew a twenty years removed thing

2139
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:44.700
While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,

2140
01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:46.500
Which I had recommended to his use

2141
01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:47.500
Not half an hour before.

2142
01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:48.800
How can this be?

2143
01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:49.970
When came he to this town?

2144
01:48:49.970 --> 01:48:51.730
To-day, my lord; and for three months before,

2145
01:48:51.730 --> 01:48:53.730
No interim, not a minute's vacancy,

2146
01:48:53.730 --> 01:48:58.070
Both day and night did we keep company.

2147
01:48:58.070 --> 01:49:02.170
Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.

2148
01:49:02.170 --> 01:49:04.530
But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness:

2149
01:49:04.530 --> 01:49:08.300
Three months this youth hath tended upon me;

2150
01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:10.870
But more of that anon. Take him aside.

2151
01:49:15.230 --> 01:49:17.270
What would my lord, but that he may not have,

2152
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:19.170
Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?

2153
01:49:19.170 --> 01:49:21.470
Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.

2154
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:22.500
Madam!

2155
01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:23.430
Gracious Olivia,--

2156
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:24.630
What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--

2157
01:49:24.630 --> 01:49:29.030
My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.

2158
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:30.470
If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,

2159
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:32.730
It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear

2160
01:49:32.730 --> 01:49:36.500
As howling after music.

2161
01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:38.470
Still so cruel?

2162
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:40.770
Still so constant, lord.

2163
01:49:40.770 --> 01:49:45.470
What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,

2164
01:49:45.470 --> 01:49:47.130
To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars

2165
01:49:47.130 --> 01:49:49.430
My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out

2166
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:54.400
That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?

2167
01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.770
Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.

2168
01:49:56.770 --> 01:49:59.470
Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,

2169
01:49:59.470 --> 01:50:01.230
Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,

2170
01:50:01.230 --> 01:50:03.670
Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy

2171
01:50:03.670 --> 01:50:06.600
That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:

2172
01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:09.670
Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,

2173
01:50:09.670 --> 01:50:11.270
And that I partly know the instrument

2174
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:14.100
That screws me from my true place in your favour,

2175
01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:17.600
Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;

2176
01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:20.730
But this your minion, whom I know you love,

2177
01:50:20.730 --> 01:50:23.200
And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,

2178
01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:25.170
Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,

2179
01:50:25.170 --> 01:50:27.730
Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.

2180
01:50:27.730 --> 01:50:31.330
Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:

2181
01:50:31.330 --> 01:50:32.930
I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,

2182
01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:34.800
To spite a raven's heart within a dove.

2183
01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:36.570
And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,

2184
01:50:36.570 --> 01:50:39.070
To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.

2185
01:50:39.070 --> 01:50:40.200
Where goes Cesario?

2186
01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:42.130
After him I love

2187
01:50:42.130 --> 01:50:45.570
More than I love these eyes, more than my life,

2188
01:50:45.570 --> 01:50:48.400
More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.

2189
01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:50.600
If I do feign, you witnesses above

2190
01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:54.070
Punish my life for tainting of my love!

2191
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:58.300
Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!

2192
01:50:58.300 --> 01:51:00.400
Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?

2193
01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:03.630
Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?

2194
01:51:03.630 --> 01:51:05.830
Call forth the holy father.

2195
01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:06.770
Come, away!

2196
01:51:06.770 --> 01:51:12.600
Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.

2197
01:51:21.330 --> 01:51:22.300
Husband!

2198
01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:24.400
Ay, husband: can he that deny?

2199
01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:26.130
Her husband, sirrah!

2200
01:51:26.130 --> 01:51:28.170
No, my lord, not I.

2201
01:51:28.170 --> 01:51:30.100
Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear

2202
01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:33.170
That makes thee strangle thy propriety:

2203
01:51:33.170 --> 01:51:35.900
Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;

2204
01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:38.000
Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art

2205
01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:42.770
As great as that thou fear'st.

2206
01:51:42.770 --> 01:51:45.300
O, welcome, father!

2207
01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:47.200
Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,

2208
01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.270
Here to unfold, though lately we intended

2209
01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:51.200
To keep in darkness what occasion now

2210
01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:53.600
Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know

2211
01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:59.130
Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.

2212
01:51:59.130 --> 01:52:02.670
A contract of eternal bond of love,

2213
01:52:02.670 --> 01:52:05.100
Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,

2214
01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:07.170
Attested by the holy close of lips,

2215
01:52:07.170 --> 01:52:10.170
Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;

2216
01:52:10.170 --> 01:52:12.570
And all the ceremony of this compact

2217
01:52:12.570 --> 01:52:17.230
Seal'd in my function, by my testimony:

2218
01:52:17.230 --> 01:52:21.200
Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave

2219
01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:24.400
I have travell'd but two hours.

2220
01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:30.000
O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be

2221
01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.830
When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?

2222
01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:34.870
Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,

2223
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:37.830
That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?

2224
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:41.470
Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet

2225
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:43.530
Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.

2226
01:52:43.530 --> 01:52:45.000
My lord, I do protest--

2227
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.070
O, do not swear!

2228
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:48.830
Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.

2229
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:51.870
For the love of God, a surgeon!

2230
01:52:51.870 --> 01:52:53.670
Send one presently to Sir Toby.

2231
01:52:53.670 --> 01:52:54.770
What's the matter?

2232
01:52:54.770 --> 01:52:56.230
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby

2233
01:52:56.230 --> 01:52:59.030
a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your help!

2234
01:52:59.030 --> 01:53:01.230
I had rather than forty pound I were at home.

2235
01:53:01.230 --> 01:53:02.970
Who has done this, Sir Andrew?

2236
01:53:02.970 --> 01:53:04.300
The count's gentleman, one Cesario:

2237
01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:05.500
we took him for a coward,

2238
01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:07.270
but he's the very devil incardinate.

2239
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:08.800
My gentleman, Cesario?

2240
01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:13.570
'Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for nothing;

2241
01:53:13.570 --> 01:53:16.570
and that that I did, I was set on to do't by Sir Toby.

2242
01:53:16.570 --> 01:53:18.970
Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:

2243
01:53:18.970 --> 01:53:21.100
You drew your sword upon me without cause;

2244
01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:24.170
But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.

2245
01:53:24.170 --> 01:53:26.770
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me:

2246
01:53:26.770 --> 01:53:29.500
I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.

2247
01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:32.330
Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more:

2248
01:53:32.330 --> 01:53:33.430
but if he had not been in drink,

2249
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:35.530
he would have tickled you othergates than he did.

2250
01:53:35.530 --> 01:53:36.870
How now, gentleman! how is't with you?

2251
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:46.930
That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end on't.

2252
01:53:46.930 --> 01:53:48.930
Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?

2253
01:53:48.930 --> 01:53:50.700
O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone;

2254
01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:52.470
his eyes were set at eight i' the morning.

2255
01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:55.970
Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn:

2256
01:53:55.970 --> 01:53:59.270
I hate a drunken rogue.

2257
01:53:59.270 --> 01:54:02.700
Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?

2258
01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:03.770
I'll help you, Sir Toby,

2259
01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:05.530
because well be dressed together.

2260
01:54:05.530 --> 01:54:09.730
Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a knave,

2261
01:54:09.730 --> 01:54:13.930
a thin-faced knave, a gull!

2262
01:54:13.930 --> 01:54:25.970
Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to.

2263
01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:27.870
I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:

2264
01:54:27.870 --> 01:54:29.070
But, had it been the brother of my blood,

2265
01:54:29.070 --> 01:54:33.100
I must have done no less with wit and safety.

2266
01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:36.000
You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that

2267
01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.800
I do perceive it hath offended you:

2268
01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:39.970
Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows

2269
01:54:39.970 --> 01:54:42.830
We made each other but so late ago.

2270
01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:48.200
One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,

2271
01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:51.070
A natural perspective, that is and is not!

2272
01:54:51.070 --> 01:54:55.930
Antonio, O my dear Antonio!

2273
01:54:55.930 --> 01:54:57.470
How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,

2274
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:59.030
Since I have lost thee!

2275
01:54:59.030 --> 01:55:01.030
Sebastian are you?

2276
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:02.770
Fear'st thou that, Antonio?

2277
01:55:02.770 --> 01:55:04.670
How have you made division of yourself?

2278
01:55:04.670 --> 01:55:06.700
An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin

2279
01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:13.400
Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?

2280
01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:15.830
Most wonderful!

2281
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:22.270
Do I stand there? I never had a brother;

2282
01:55:22.270 --> 01:55:23.930
Nor can there be that deity in my nature,

2283
01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:28.070
Of here and every where. I had a sister,

2284
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:30.400
Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.

2285
01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:32.930
Of charity, what kin are you to me?

2286
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:35.230
What countryman? what name? what parentage?

2287
01:55:35.230 --> 01:55:39.530
Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;

2288
01:55:39.530 --> 01:55:42.400
Such a Sebastian was my brother too,

2289
01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:46.600
So went he suited to his watery tomb:

2290
01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:49.000
If spirits can assume both form and suit

2291
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.330
You come to fright us.

2292
01:55:50.330 --> 01:55:52.070
A spirit I am indeed;

2293
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:54.030
But am in that dimension grossly clad

2294
01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:57.100
Which from the womb I did participate.

2295
01:55:57.100 --> 01:55:58.470
Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,

2296
01:55:58.470 --> 01:56:01.430
I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,

2297
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:04.030
And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'

2298
01:56:04.030 --> 01:56:05.930
My father had a mole upon his brow.

2299
01:56:05.930 --> 01:56:06.900
And so had mine.

2300
01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:08.830
And died that day when Viola from her birth

2301
01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:10.500
Had number'd thirteen years.

2302
01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:12.400
O, that record is lively in my soul!

2303
01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:13.970
He finished indeed his mortal act

2304
01:56:13.970 --> 01:56:15.770
That day that made my sister thirteen years.

2305
01:56:15.770 --> 01:56:18.770
If nothing lets to make us happy both

2306
01:56:18.770 --> 01:56:21.400
But this my masculine usurp'd attire,

2307
01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:24.130
Do not embrace me till each circumstance

2308
01:56:24.130 --> 01:56:28.200
Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump

2309
01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:33.130
That I am Viola: which to confirm,

2310
01:56:33.130 --> 01:56:35.000
I'll bring you to a captain in this town,

2311
01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:38.530
Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help

2312
01:56:38.530 --> 01:56:43.800
I was preserved to serve this noble count.

2313
01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:46.870
All the occurrence of my fortune since

2314
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:52.500
Hath been between this lady and this lord.

2315
01:56:55.270 --> 01:57:00.070
So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:

2316
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:03.630
But nature to her bias drew in that.

2317
01:57:03.630 --> 01:57:06.770
You would have been contracted to a maid;

2318
01:57:06.770 --> 01:57:09.000
Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,

2319
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.570
You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.

2320
01:57:13.570 --> 01:57:19.300
Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.

2321
01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:21.300
If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,

2322
01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:25.430
I shall have share in this most happy wreck.

2323
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:29.500
Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times

2324
01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:32.070
Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.

2325
01:57:32.070 --> 01:57:34.800
And all those sayings will I overswear;

2326
01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:36.770
And those swearings keep as true in soul

2327
01:57:36.770 --> 01:57:39.530
As doth that orbed continent the fire

2328
01:57:39.530 --> 01:57:41.130
That severs day from night.

2329
01:57:41.130 --> 01:57:43.570
Give me thy hand;

2330
01:57:43.570 --> 01:57:45.430
And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.

2331
01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:47.400
The captain that did bring me first on shore

2332
01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:50.400
Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action

2333
01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:52.270
Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,

2334
01:57:52.270 --> 01:57:54.730
A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.

2335
01:57:54.730 --> 01:57:58.100
He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:

2336
01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:00.970
And yet, alas, now I remember me,

2337
01:58:00.970 --> 01:58:03.670
They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.

2338
01:58:03.670 --> 01:58:05.630
A most extracting frenzy of mine own

2339
01:58:05.630 --> 01:58:09.100
From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.

2340
01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:11.100
How does he, sirrah?

2341
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:13.430
Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end

2342
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:15.500
as well as a man in his case may do:

2343
01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:17.270
has here writ a letter to you;

2344
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:19.630
I should have given't you to-day morning,

2345
01:58:19.630 --> 01:58:22.870
but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,

2346
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:25.470
so it skills not much when they are delivered.

2347
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:29.170
Open't, and read it.

2348
01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:30.830
Look then to be well edified

2349
01:58:30.830 --> 01:58:32.730
when the fool delivers the madman.

2350
01:58:32.730 --> 01:58:34.270
'By the Lord, madam,'--

2351
01:58:34.270 --> 01:58:36.230
How now! art thou mad?

2352
01:58:36.230 --> 01:58:38.370
No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship

2353
01:58:38.370 --> 01:58:40.670
will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.

2354
01:58:40.670 --> 01:58:42.630
Prithee, read i' thy right wits.

2355
01:58:42.630 --> 01:58:45.530
So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to read thus:

2356
01:58:45.530 --> 01:58:48.100
therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.

2357
01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:49.100
Read it you, sirrah.

2358
01:58:49.100 --> 01:59:01.370
'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me,

2359
01:59:01.370 --> 01:59:03.100
and the world shall know it:

2360
01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:04.670
though you have put me into darkness

2361
01:59:04.670 --> 01:59:07.770
and given your drunken cousin rule over me,

2362
01:59:07.770 --> 01:59:11.000
yet have I the benefit of my senses

2363
01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.830
as well as your ladyship.

2364
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:14.330
I have your own letter

2365
01:59:14.330 --> 01:59:18.970
that induced me to the semblance I put on;

2366
01:59:18.970 --> 01:59:21.430
with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right,

2367
01:59:21.430 --> 01:59:24.430
or you much shame.

2368
01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:26.970
Think of me as you please. I leave my duty

2369
01:59:26.970 --> 01:59:30.830
a little unthought of and speak out of my injury.

2370
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:33.100
THE MADLY-USED .' MALVOLIO

2371
01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:34.370
Did he write this?

2372
01:59:34.370 --> 01:59:35.200
Ay, madam.

2373
01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:37.200
This savours not much of distraction.

2374
01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:39.870
See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.

2375
01:59:42.770 --> 01:59:46.570
My lord, these things further thought on,

2376
01:59:46.570 --> 01:59:49.700
To think me as well a sister as a wife,

2377
01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:53.070
One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,

2378
01:59:53.070 --> 01:59:55.700
Here at my house and at my proper cost.

2379
01:59:55.700 --> 02:00:01.730
Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.

2380
02:00:01.730 --> 02:00:05.600
Your master quits you; and for your service done him,

2381
02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:08.270
So much against the mettle of your sex,

2382
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:12.100
So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,

2383
02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:15.630
And since you call'd me master for so long,

2384
02:00:15.630 --> 02:00:18.770
Here is my hand: you shall from this time be

2385
02:00:18.770 --> 02:00:22.270
Your master's mistress.

2386
02:00:22.270 --> 02:00:28.870
A sister! you are she.

2387
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:30.430
Is this the madman?

2388
02:00:30.430 --> 02:00:33.270
Ay, my lord, this same.

2389
02:00:33.270 --> 02:00:35.530
How now, Malvolio!

2390
02:00:35.530 --> 02:00:38.870
Madam, you have done me wrong,

2391
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:39.830
Notorious wrong.

2392
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:41.300
Have I, Malvolio? no.

2393
02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:45.000
Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.

2394
02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.530
You must not now deny it is your hand:

2395
02:00:47.530 --> 02:00:48.970
Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;

2396
02:00:48.970 --> 02:00:51.970
Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:

2397
02:00:51.970 --> 02:00:54.330
You can say none of this: well, grant it then

2398
02:00:54.330 --> 02:00:56.470
And tell me, in the modesty of honour,

2399
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:58.100
Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,

2400
02:00:58.100 --> 02:01:01.600
Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,

2401
02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:03.000
To put on yellow stockings and to frown

2402
02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.700
Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;

2403
02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:07.270
And, acting this in an obedient hope,

2404
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:09.630
Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,

2405
02:01:09.630 --> 02:01:13.170
Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,

2406
02:01:13.170 --> 02:01:14.800
And made the most notorious geck and gull

2407
02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:18.030
That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.

2408
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:20.700
Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,

2409
02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:22.430
Though, I confess, much like the character

2410
02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:26.270
But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.

2411
02:01:26.270 --> 02:01:28.700
And now I do bethink me, it was she

2412
02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:31.970
First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,

2413
02:01:31.970 --> 02:01:34.430
And in such forms which here were presupposed

2414
02:01:34.430 --> 02:01:38.500
Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:

2415
02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:41.100
This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;

2416
02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:43.200
But when we know the grounds and authors of it,

2417
02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:45.030
Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge

2418
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:48.930
Of thine own cause.

2419
02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:56.670
Good madam, hear me speak,

2420
02:01:56.670 --> 02:01:59.670
And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come

2421
02:01:59.670 --> 02:02:01.800
Taint the condition of this present hour,

2422
02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:04.570
Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,

2423
02:02:04.570 --> 02:02:07.470
Most freely I confess, myself and Toby

2424
02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:11.170
Set this device against Malvolio here,

2425
02:02:11.170 --> 02:02:12.600
Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts

2426
02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:16.830
We had conceived against him: Maria writ

2427
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:21.500
The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;

2428
02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:26.230
In recompense whereof he hath married her.

2429
02:02:26.230 --> 02:02:27.930
How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,

2430
02:02:27.930 --> 02:02:32.100
May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;

2431
02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:33.630
If that the injuries be justly weigh'd

2432
02:02:33.630 --> 02:02:36.470
That have on both sides pass'd.

2433
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:42.900
Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!

2434
02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:47.300
Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,

2435
02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:51.030
and some have greatness thrown upon them.'

2436
02:02:51.770 --> 02:02:56.730
I was one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir;

2437
02:02:56.730 --> 02:03:01.470
but that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'

2438
02:03:01.470 --> 02:03:03.930
But do you remember?

2439
02:03:03.930 --> 02:03:07.500
'Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal?

2440
02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:10.300
an you smile not, he's gagged:'

2441
02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:18.770
and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.

2442
02:03:18.770 --> 02:03:23.170
I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.

2443
02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:30.800
He hath been most notoriously abused.

2444
02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:34.470
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:

2445
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:37.870
He hath not told us of the captain yet:

2446
02:03:37.870 --> 02:03:40.930
When that is known and golden time convents,

2447
02:03:40.930 --> 02:03:42.530
A solemn combination shall be made

2448
02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:45.900
Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,

2449
02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:51.700
We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;

2450
02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:54.400
For so you shall be, while you are a man;

2451
02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:56.800
But when in other habits you are seen,

2452
02:03:56.800 --> 02:04:05.700
Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.

2453
02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:18.030
[Sings]

2454
02:04:18.030 --> 02:04:22.800
When that I was and a little tiny boy,

2455
02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:27.670
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,

2456
02:04:27.670 --> 02:04:32.370
A foolish thing was but a toy,

2457
02:04:32.370 --> 02:04:37.900
For the rain it raineth every day.

2458
02:04:37.900 --> 02:04:42.730
But when I came to man's estate,

2459
02:04:42.730 --> 02:04:47.730
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain.

2460
02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:54.870
'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,

2461
02:04:54.870 --> 02:05:00.400
For the rain, it rain'th every day.

2462
02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:05.830
It rain'th every day.

2463
02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:10.430
But when I came, alas! to wive,

2464
02:05:10.430 --> 02:05:15.570
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain

2465
02:05:15.570 --> 02:05:20.730
By swaggering could I never thrive,

2466
02:05:20.730 --> 02:05:26.130
For the rain, it rain'th every day.

2467
02:05:26.130 --> 02:05:31.200
But when I came unto my beds,

2468
02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:36.970
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain.

2469
02:05:36.970 --> 02:05:42.730
With toss-pots still had drunken heads,

2470
02:05:42.730 --> 02:05:48.370
For the rain, it rain'th every day.

2471
02:05:48.370 --> 02:05:54.330
It rain'th every day.

2472
02:05:54.330 --> 02:06:00.170
A great while ago the world begun,

2473
02:06:00.170 --> 02:06:06.300
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain.

2474
02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:13.630
But that's all one, our play is done,

2475
02:06:13.630 --> 02:06:20.800
And we'll strive to please you every day.

2476
02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:27.870
To please you every day.

2477
02:06:29.530 --> 02:06:37.070
(♪music)

2478
02:08:51.730 --> 02:08:54.730
