00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.270
THERE ARE SOME
GREAT QUESTIONS

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.330
THAT HAVE INTRIGUED
AND HAUNTED US

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.300
SINCE THE DAWN
OF HUMANITY.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.770
WHAT IS OUT THERE?

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.870
HOW DID WE
GET HERE?

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:33.100
WHAT IS THE
WORLD MADE OF?

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.330
THE STORY OF OUR SEARCH
TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.400
IS THE STORY
OF SCIENCE.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.270
OF ALL HUMAN
ENDEAVORS,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.300
SCIENCE HAS HAD THE
GREATEST IMPACT ON OUR LIVES,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.530
ON HOW WE SEE THE WORLD,
ON HOW WE SEE OURSELVES.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:59.870
ITS IDEAS, ITS ACHIEVEMENTS,
ITS RESULTS ARE ALL AROUND US.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.370
BUT THE STORY OF
SCIENCE HAS BEEN SHAPED

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.270
AS MUCH BY WHAT'S OUTSIDE
THE LABORATORY AS INSIDE.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.470
POWER AND PASSION,
RIVALRY AND SHEER CHANCE

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.130
HAVE ALL PLAYED
SIGNIFICANT ROLES.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.100
THIS IS THE STORY OF
HOW HISTORY MADE SCIENCE

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.470
AND HOW SCIENCE
MADE HISTORY.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:34.900


00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.300
THIS TIME, THE MOST PERSONAL
QUESTION WE'VE ASKED:

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.670
HOW DID W<i>E</i>
GET HERE?

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.930


00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.600
WHAT'S INTRIGUING ABOUT THE
QUESTION OF HOW DID WE GET HERE

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.500
IS REALLY JUST HOW LONG IT
TOOK FOR IT TO BE ASKED AT ALL

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.370
BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE BELIEVED
THEY ALREADY KNEW THE ANSWER

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:15.270
HANDED DOWN FROM CREATION
STORIES OR RELIGIOUS TEXTS.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.470
BUT EVENTUALLY SCIENCE
WOULD FORCE PEOPLE

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.930
TO LOOK ELSEWHERE
FOR THE ANSWER.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.270
AND IT'S A STORY WHICH
BEGINS ON THE HIGH SEAS

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.030
A LITTLE OVER
500 YEARS AGO.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.800


00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.770
THE GREAT VOYAGES OF
DISCOVERY OF THE 15TH CENTURY

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.770
HERALDED THE START
OF THE MODERN WORLD.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.370
ADVANCES IN NAVIGATION
AND SHIP BUILDING

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.370
ALLOWED ADVENTURERS
TO EXPLORE AND EXPLOIT

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.430
THE REST OF THE GLOBE,
LEADING TO ONE OF THE MOST

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.700
IMPORTANT EVENTS
IN HUMAN HISTORY:

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.200
THE EUROPEAN DISCOVERY
OF THE AMERICAS.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:21.000


00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.700
THE FIRST EXPLORERS CAME TO THE
NEW WORLD UTTERLY CONVINCED

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.970
THAT THEY WERE SPECIAL, SET
APART FROM THE REST OF NATURE

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.900
- THE PINNACLE
OF GOD'S CREATION.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.000
THAT THIS ATTITUDE
GRADUALLY BEGAN TO CHANGE

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.870
IS THANKS IN NO SMALL
PART TO AN IRISH DOCTOR

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.270
CALLED
HANS SLOANE.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:53.270


00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.230
IN 1687 SLOANE ARRIVED
ON THE ISLAND OF JAMAICA

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.270
AS PERSONAL PHYSICIAN
TO THE GOVERNOR.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.500
BUT SLOANE WAS ALSO
A PASSIONATE BOTANIST

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.030
WHO LOVED TO GO EXPLORING
THE ISLAND ON HORSEBACK

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.200
IN SEARCH OF
WHAT HE CALLED

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.670
"ALL THAT IS
EXTRAORDINARY IN NATURE".

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:27.070


00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.930
MARLON BEALE IS ALSO A
BOTANIST BASED IN JAMAICA'S

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:38.800
BLUE MOUNTAINS - SOMEWHERE
SLOANE VISITED MANY TIMES.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.170
SLOANE FIRST AND
FOREMOST WAS A DOCTOR,

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.930
A DOCTOR WHO WAS INTERESTED
IN FINDING MEDICINES.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.800
SO WHEN HE CAME TO JAMAICA,
JAMAICA WOULD BE FILLED WITH

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.230
LUSH, GREEN
FORESTS...

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.100
WONDERFUL FOR HIM
TO FIND MEDICINES IN.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.900
HERE WE HAVE A HEADACHE
BUSH, SO NAMED BECAUSE

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.900
IT CAN CURE
YOUR HEADACHES.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.030
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS PULL OFF
A FEW LEAVES AND CRUSH THEM AND

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.930
BASICALLY YOU GET A REALLY NICE
PUNGENT SMELL THAT ALLOWS YOU,

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.870
WHEN YOU SMELL IT,
TO CURE YOUR HEADACHE.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.800
SO COMMITTED WAS SLOANE
TO HIS TASK THAT HE WOULD

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.770
OFTEN SPEND DAYS AT A
TIME OUT IN THE FIELD...

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.670
A HANDS-ON APPROACH THAT
ENABLED HIM TO DOCUMENT

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.600
JAMAICA'S
AMAZING DIVERSITY.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.500
THIS IS
WILD GINGER.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.630
IT BELONGS TO THE FAMILY
KNOWN AS ZINGIBERACEAE

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.000
AND IT'S VERY
IMPORTANT...

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.730
ONE THAT SLOANE WOULD
HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.630
IT HAS A LOT OF
MEDICINAL PROPERTIES.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.830
IT'S BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN
A CURE FOR SEASICKNESS

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.200
SO VERY, VERY
IMPORTANT.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.130


00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.470
BUT AN INTEREST IN NATURE
WASN'T CONFINED TO BOTANISTS

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.670
LIKE SLOANE BECAUSE IN NATURE,
AND PARTICULARLY PLANTS,

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:13.270
LAY THE FOUNDATIONS
OF IMPERIAL POWER.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.700
TRADERS BEGAN TO BRING HOME
ALL SORTS OF NATURAL PRODUCE

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.730
FROM SUGAR AND SPICES
TO TEA AND TIMBER.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:28.130
THE BOTANICAL BOOTY
WAS PRACTICALLY ENDLESS.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.530
EVEN THE SHIPS WHICH
CARRIED THE GOODS

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.430
WERE THEMSELVES
BUILT FROM PLANTS.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.630
THERE WERE TREES
FOR THE FRAMEWORK.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.000
HEMP PROVIDED THE
SAILS AND THE ROPE.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.430
AND FROM PINE
RESIN CAME PITCH

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.070
WHICH WAS USED TO
WATERPROOF THE SHIPS.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.470


00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.870
BUT WHILE OTHERS SHARED
THEIR INTEREST IN PLANTS,

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.330
WHAT SEPARATED
COLLECTORS LIKE SLOANE

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.970
FROM THE TRADERS
AND PLANTATION OWNERS

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.630
WAS A FASCINATION
WITH ALL OF NATURE -

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.300
BOTH PLANTS
AND ANIMALS...

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.330
AN ALL ENCOMPASSING
PASSION THAT WOULD OPEN

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.600
THE WORLD'S EYES, NOT JUST
TO THE BEAUTY OF CREATION,

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.730
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
ITS DIVERSITY.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:31.330


00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.670
EVENTUALLY SLOANE
RETURNED TO ENGLAND.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.100
NOT WITH TALL TALES OF
MERMAIDS AND SEA SERPENTS

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:44.170
BUT WITH
REAL SPECIMENS.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.730
AND WHILE THERE WAS NO REASON
AS YET TO BELIEVE THAT ALL THIS

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.700
DIVERSITY HAD ANYTHING TO DO
WITH US AND HOW WE GOT HERE,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.200
IT DID BEGIN TO JAR
WITH TRADITIONAL IDEAS

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.530
OF GOD'S CREATION.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:04.630


00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.930
BY THE TIME HANS SLOANE
DIED IN 1753 HE HAD AMASSED

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:13.300
THE WORLD'S GREATEST
COLLECTION OF NATURAL OBJECTS.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:21.670
THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHICH
ARE STILL WITH US TODAY.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.530
THERE ARE MANY
THOUSANDS OF OBJECTS.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.400
ABOUT 14,000 OF THESE
VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES...

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:34.900
FLOWERS, FRUITS, DRIED
OBJECTS WHICH WE CAN'T PRESS.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:44.100


00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.130
AND WITH THAT THERE ARE
ABOUT 270 BOUND VOLUMES

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.570
WITH MANY, MANY
THOUSANDS OF SPECIMENS.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.770
AFTER HIS VOYAGE TO
JAMAICA SLOANE DIDN'T

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.530
REALLY DO ANY PERSONAL
COLLECTING HIMSELF.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.370
HE ACTUALLY SAT IN THE
MIDDLE OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:04.500
WHO COLLECTED MATERIAL OR
HAD MATERIAL GIVEN TO THEM

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.130
FROM A VERY WIDE RANGE
OF PLACES IN THE WORLD.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.870
SO FOR EXAMPLE, HERE, THIS
OBJECT IS ACTUALLY JUNIPER

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.900
AND WAS COLLECTED BY A
CAPTAIN JENKINS IN GEORGIA

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.130
CURRENT
UNITED STATES.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.100
SO IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF
THE FIRST JUNIPER SPECIMENS

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.230
THAT STILL SURVIVES

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.570
THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY
GOT IN OUR COLLECTIONS.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.970
IN FACT, SO VAST WAS SLOANE'S
HORDE OF NATURAL WONDERS

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.500
THAT IT WAS EVENTUALLY
MOVED TO A NEW TYPE

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.830
OF INSTITUTION BEGINNING
TO APPEAR ACROSS EUROPE:

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.100
THE NATIONAL
MUSEUM.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.670
PRIVATE COLLECTIONS LIKE
SLOANE'S WERE NOW ACCESSIBLE

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.970
TO A MUCH
LARGER AUDIENCE...

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.930
BRINGING NATURE OUT
OF THE WILDERNESS

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:58.130
AND INTO THE
EVERYDAY WORLD.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.630
AND THAT WAS VITAL
IN SCIENTIFIC ENDEAVOR,

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.800
HAVING THEM IN
AN ACCESSIBLE PLACE

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.030
WHERE PEOPLE COULD
HAVE A DIALOGUE AND

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.570
REALLY GET TO UNDERSTAND
THE DIVERSITY OF THE PLANET.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:14.630


00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:20.130
A NEW CURIOSITY ABOUT LIFE
ON EARTH WOULD NOW BRING US

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.270
CLOSER TO THE QUESTION
OF HOW DID WE GET HERE

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:26.330
FUELED BY VOYAGES
OF DISCOVERY

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.400
AND THE MONEY TO
BE MADE FROM NATURE

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:34.570
BY OBSESSIVE COLLECTORS
LIKE HANS SLOANE

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:40.030
WHO BEGAN TO DOCUMENT
NATURE'S DIVERSITY...

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.530
AND MUSEUMS, WHICH
MEANT ORDINARY PEOPLE

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:47.600
COULD SEE IT
FOR THEMSELVES.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.670
AND IT NOW TURNED OUT
THAT ALL THIS DIVERSITY

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.300
ALSO HAD A
HISTORY...

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.900
A RATHER
RICH ONE.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:06.070


00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.500
OUR STORY MOVES TO FRANCE
WHERE THE TRADITIONAL IDEA

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.170
OF GOD'S FIXED UNIVERSE
WAS ABOUT TO BE FURTHER

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.370
UNDERMINED THANKS TO
A BRILLIANT ANATOMIST

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.830
AND AN INDUSTRY
DEEP UNDERGROUND.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:33.230


00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.930
DIRECTLY BENEATH PARIS LIES AN
OLD NETWORK OF STONE QUARRIES

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.000
LINKED BY A SERIES OF
CONNECTING TUNNELS.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.600
TOGETHER THEY FORM A MIRROR
IMAGE OF THE CITY ABOVE

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.870
EVEN DOWN TO
THE STREET NAMES.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:59.100
GILLES THOMAS IS AN EXPERT
ON THIS SUBTERRANEAN WORLD.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.700
TRANSLATOR: THERE ARE ABOUT
150 KILOMETERS OF TUNNELS

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.770
ROUGHLY 20 METERS
BENEATH THE SURFACE.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.170
NOW AND THEN YOU COME
ACROSS THESE OLD QUARRIES

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.500
USED IN THE BUILDING
OF MUCH OF PARIS.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:20.100
30% OF THE STONE IN NOTRE DAME
ACTUALLY CAME FROM THIS QUARRY.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:27.530


00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.570
AS MORE QUARRIES
WERE EXCAVATED

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.570
PEOPLE BEGAN TO TAKE A
GREATER INTEREST IN THE

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:38.330
MYSTERIOUS OBJECTS THEY WERE
FINDING EMBEDDED IN THE ROCK.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:43.930
TRANSLATOR: FROM TIME TO
TIME YOU CAN SEE THE ORIGINAL

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:49.970
CEILING OF THE QUARRY
WHICH ARE FULL OF FOSSILS.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:54.270
ALL THESE FOSSILS FORMED
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:59.070
ABOUT 45 MILLION
YEARS AGO.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:03.470
MOST OF THEM ARE THESE
VERY SMALL SEASHELLS.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.830
BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
RIVER AND BENEATH THE SUBURBS

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:13.670
YOU CAN ALSO FIND
MUCH BIGGER ONES.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:19.600
FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLE HAD NO
IDEA WHAT FOSSILS REALLY WERE.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.770
SOME CLAIMED THEY HAD
FALLEN FROM THE MOON.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.000
OTHERS THAT THEY WERE
MUD'S UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.330
TO TURN INTO LIFE.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:35.830
IT WASN'T UNTIL THE 18TH CENTURY
THAT PEOPLE FULLY APPRECIATED

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.470
THEY HAD ONCE BEEN LIVING
THINGS, AND THIS REALIZATION

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:44.330
OPENED UP A WHOLE NEW
WINDOW INTO THE PAST...

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:48.300
A PAST THAT WAS
BOTH VERY ANCIENT

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.770
AND UNIMAGINABLY
DIFFERENT.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:14:02.030


00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.800
HERE IN FRANCE MANY OF
THOSE FOSSILS ENDED UP

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.970
IN THE HANDS OF A
BRILLIANT SCIENTIST...

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:15.000
A MAN OBSESSED
BY OLD BONES.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.900
HIS NAME WAS GEORGES CUVIER
AND HE WAS WIDELY REGARDED

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.670
AS THE WORLD'S LEADING
ANIMAL ANATOMIST.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.530
THERE WAS BARELY AN
ANIMAL IN EXISTENCE

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:32.370
WHOSE REMAINS
HADN'T COME HIS WAY.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:39.100
TRANSLATOR: THE YOUNG
NATURALIST GEORGES CUVIER

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.830
ARRIVED HERE AT THE MUSEUM AT
THE AGE OF 25 FROM NORMANDY

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.400
AND BROUGHT WITH HIM A
NEW WAY OF STUDYING ANIMALS.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:53.700
CUVIER OPENED AND
DISSECTED ANIMALS

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.630
AND STUDIED THEIR
ORGANS AND BONES,

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.470
COMPARING EACH PART OF THE
SKELETON TO OTHER ANIMALS,

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:05.330
TAKING NOTE OF SIMILARITIES
AND DIFFERENCES.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.600
AFTER A BIT HE BEGAN TO
NOTICE A CORRELATION

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.230
BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT
PARTS OF THE SKELETON.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:19.030
BY EXAMINING THE FORM OF ANY
BODY PART, CUVIER MAINTAINED

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.770
THAT ONE COULD DISCOVER
EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO KNOW

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:28.370
ABOUT ITS FUNCTION, AND FROM
ITS FUNCTION ITS LIKELY SOURCE.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:32.200
A REVOLUTIONARY TECHNIQUE
THAT ENABLED CUVIER

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.800
TO IDENTIFY MANY OF THE
PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN FOSSILS

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.500
BEING DISCOVERED
BENEATH PARIS...

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.230
AND WHICH HE WOULD NOW
APPLY TO SOME REMAINS

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:48.430
NOT FROM FRANCE, BUT RUSSIA,
BELONGING TO AN ANIMAL

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:53.500
KNOWN TO THE LOCALS
AS THE MAMMOTH.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:58.370
WHILE MOST PEOPLE CONSIDERED
MAMMOTHS TO BE CLOSE RELATIVES

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:04.000
OF MODERN ELEPHANTS,
CUVIER WAS NOT CONVINCED.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.200
TRANSLATOR: CUVIER HAD THE IDEA
OF COMPARING THIS BIG TOOTH

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.600
FROM RUSSIA WITH THIS ONE IN
MY LEFT HAND WHICH IS FROM

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.830
AN AFRICAN ELEPHANT AND WHICH
YOU CAN SEE IS VERY DIFFERENT

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:21.130
BECAUSE THE SURFACE LAMINA
ARE THESE DIAMOND SHAPES.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.570
AND THEY ARE NOT AS
NUMEROUS AS THOSE

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:27.070
ON THE TOOTH IN MY RIGHT
HAND FROM THE MAMMOTH.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.000
IT HAS MANY MORE LAMINA
AND THEY ARE PARALLEL,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.700
AND SO THEREFORE THIS
AFRICAN ELEPHANT'S TOOTH

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:39.270
IS VERY DIFFERENT TO
THIS TOOTH FROM RUSSIA.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:44.770
SO DIFFERENT, IN FACT, AS
TO PERSUADE CUVIER THAT

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:50.000
MAMMOTHS WERE A TOTALLY
NEW SPECIES OF ELEPHANT.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
BUT THIS REVELATION
WAS AS NOTHING

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.470
COMPARED TO CUVIER'S
NEXT BOMBSHELL.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:03.170


00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:06.770
CUVIER ARGUED THAT SINCE NO
ONE HAD EVER SEEN A MAMMOTH,

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.930
DESPITE BEING
IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS,

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.170
THEY MUST ALL AT SOME
POINT IN THE DISTANT PAST

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.430
HAVE GONE
EXTINCT.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:23.500


00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.400
AND THIS, TO THE MANY PEOPLE WHO
BELIEVED THAT GOD'S UNIVERSE

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.000
WAS FIXED AND UNCHANGING,
WAS NOT JUST BAFFLING

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.170
BUT DEEPLY
DISTURBING.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:39.600
AND IT WASN'T
JUST MAMMOTHS.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.670
BEFORE LONG HUNDREDS OF
OTHER STRANGE LOOKING FOSSILS

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.230
UNLIKE ANYTHING
ALIVE TODAY

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.470
WERE BEING IDENTIFIED AS
CREATURES THAT HAD ALL

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:53.430
MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED
OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:59.530


00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:03.730
THE ONLY CONSOLATION WAS
THAT THIS WAS A HISTORY OF LIFE

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:08.100
WHICH HUMANS STILL REGARDED
THEMSELVES AS SEPARATE FROM.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:14.530


00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:18.800
FOR NOW THE MOST PRESSING
QUESTION RAISED BY EXTINCTION

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:22.070
WAS ONE OF TIME...

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.300
AND WHETHER THIS
EXTRAORDINARY FOSSIL RECORD

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:29.030
OF LONG-LOST SPECIES MIGHT
BE EVIDENCE THAT THE EARTH

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:33.200
WAS IN FACT MUCH OLDER
THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:42.730


00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:46.570
THE 18TH CENTURY WAS
THE AGE OF THE EXPERIMENT.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:52.030
THERE WERE EXPERIMENTS
ON LIGHT, LIQUIDS, GASES,

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.600
BUT ALSO A ROUGH
AND READY EXPERIMENT

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.830
BY THE FRENCH ARISTOCRAT
LE COMTE DE BUFFON

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:06.430
TO ESTABLISH THE
PRECISE AGE OF THE EARTH.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:10.100
TRANSLATOR: THE GENERAL
FEELING IN BUFFON'S TIME

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.700
WAS THAT THE EARTH WAS
AROUND 6,000 YEARS OLD,

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.500
SOME 4,000 YEARS
BEFORE JESUS CHRIST.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.370
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE
WAS SOME SPECULATION

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.430
AMONGST THE
MATERIALISTS AND EPICUREANS

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:28.770
THAT THE WORLD MIGHT
BE, IN FACT, ETERNAL.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.700


00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.330
BUFFON'S BIG
CONTRIBUTION WAS TO

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.770
BRING TO THESE QUESTIONS
A SCIENTIFIC APPROACH...

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.000
A METHOD THAT
COULD BE VERIFIED

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.500
AND TESTED
EMPIRICALLY.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.870
THE INSPIRATION FOR BUFFON'S
EXPERIMENT CAME FROM AN IDEA

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:57.430
THAT THE WORLD HAD STARTED
OFF AS A RED HOT LUMP OF IRON.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:02.730
BUFFON REASONED THAT IF ONE
COULD WORK OUT HOW LONG

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:06.170
IT HAD TAKEN FOR THE EARTH
TO COOL TO ITS PRESENT STATE

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:10.630
ONE COULD THEN GO ON TO
WORK OUT JUST HOW OLD IT WAS.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:14.870


00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:19.870
TRANSLATOR: BUFFON TOOK SOME
METAL BALLS OF DIFFERENT SIZES,

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:25.230
TEN IN ALL, FROM HALF AN INCH
IN DIAMETER UP TO FIVE INCHES.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.170
HE THEN HEATED THEM
UNTIL THEY WERE WHITE HOT

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:30.230
BEFORE MEASURING
THE TIME IT TOOK

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.430
FOR THEM TO
COOL DOWN AGAIN.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:39.030


00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.970
BY TIMING HOW LONG IT TOOK
FOR HIS VARIOUS IRON BALLS

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:45.070
TO COOL DOWN, BUFFON WAS
CONFIDENT THAT HE COULD

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.170
EXTRAPOLATE HIS FIGURES
TO ESTABLISH HOW LONG

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:52.630
IT HAD TAKEN THE EARTH
TO REACH A SIMILAR STATE.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.500


00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:00.600
TRANSLATOR: BUFFON
ARRIVED AT THREE FIGURES.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:05.070
THE FIRST WAS
ABOUT 37,500 YEARS,

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:09.270
THE AGE AT WHICH THE EARTH
WAS ABLE TO SUPPORT LIFE.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:13.700
THE SECOND FIGURE,
AROUND 75,000 YEARS,

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:18.900
WAS THE ACTUAL AGE OF THE
EARTH UP TO THE PRESENT DAY.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.700
BUT THEN HE ALSO CAME
UP WITH A THIRD NUMBER

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.500
OF 160,000 YEARS, THE
AGE AT WHICH THE EARTH

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:30.570
WOULD BE SO COLD THAT
LIFE WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:33.600


00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.070
NO MATTER HOW
INACCURATE WE NOW KNOW

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:39.130
BUFFON'S FINDINGS TO BE, IT
WOULD BE SOMEWHAT CHURLISH

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:42.830
TO LET THAT DETRACT
FROM HIS LEGACY.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:47.430


00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:50.230
TRANSLATOR: I BELIEVE THAT
BUFFON SHOULD GO DOWN

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:53.700
IN SCIENTIFIC HISTORY BECAUSE
HE SHOWED HOW QUESTIONS

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.830
OF NATURAL HISTORY
SHOULD BE APPROACHED

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.830
- NOT THROUGH
THEOLOGICAL SPECULATION

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.700
BUT BY APPLYING
PHYSICAL FACTS.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:08.900


00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.970
AND THIS SCIENTIFIC APPROACH
WOULD NOW BE INTENSIFIED

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.730
BY A WHOLE NEW WAY OF
LOOKING AT THE WORLD...

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:21.070
A BRAND NEW BRANCH OF
SCIENCE CALLED GEOLOGY.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:28.230


00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:30.630
ACROSS LATE 18TH
CENTURY EUROPE,

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:34.070
PRACTICALLY DRESSED MEN
ARMED WITH SMALL HAMMERS

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.370
BEGAN TO HEAD OFF
INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:41.770
IN SEARCH OF THE EARTH'S
MOST HIDDEN SECRETS.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:45.100
IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE
THEY STARTED TO NOTICE

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:50.500
A NUMBER OF STRANGE
ANOMALIES IN THE LANDSCAPE.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:56.430
SICCAR POINT IN SCOTLAND
IS FAMOUS FOR A PECULIAR

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.600
ROCKY OUTCROP THAT
ONE EARLY GEOLOGIST

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:07.270
DESCRIBED AS LIKE LOOKING
INTO "THE ABYSS OF TIME".

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:12.530
DR. CLARE BOND IS A
LECTURER IN EARTH SCIENCES

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:17.830
FROM GLASGOW
UNIVERSITY.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.670
WHAT WE HAVE HERE ARE A SERIES
OF ROCKS THAT ARE VERTICAL

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:29.730
AND A SECOND SET OF ROCKS
ABOVE WHICH ARE HORIZONTAL

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.430
AND BETWEEN THE TWO
THERE'S A CONTACT.

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:36.930
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL
AN UNCONFORMITY

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:39.330
AND WHEN IT
WAS FOUND,

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.500
AND OTHER EXAMPLES LIKE
IT ACROSS SCOTLAND,

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.970
IT REALLY EXCITED THE
GEOLOGISTS AT THE TIME...

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:52.100
PROMPTING SOME OF THEM TO PUT
FORWARD A RADICAL EXPLANATION.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:57.370


00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:00.130
WHAT WE NOW KNOW IS ACTUALLY
THESE ROCKS WERE PART OF

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.770
AN OCEAN THAT SEPARATED
SCOTLAND FROM ENGLAND

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.900
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY
DURING THAT PROCESS

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.270
OF THE OCEAN CLOSING
THAT THESE ROCKS

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:12.430
WERE PUSHED TOGETHER
INTO THE VERTICAL LAYERS.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.200
AND ON TOP OF THAT
THESE ROCKS WERE LAID DOWN

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.900
AND THEY'RE KIND OF NICE SUN
STONES THAT YOU SEE TODAY.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:25.770
ALL OF WHICH COULD
MEAN ONLY ONE THING...

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:28.430
ALTHOUGH THE FIRST
GEOLOGISTS MIGHT NOT KNOW

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.130
WHAT WE KNOW TODAY,
WHAT THEY DID CONCLUDE

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.370
WAS THAT IT WOULD
HAVE TAKEN A LONG TIME

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.170
FOR THESE ROCKS TO HAVE
GONE FROM BEING HORIZONTAL

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:40.700
TO BEING PUSHED UP
IN A VERTICAL POSITION.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.800
SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE REALLY
FROZEN INTO THE ROCKS

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.000
IS A HUGE
REPRESENTATION OF TIME

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.130
AND THAT BECAME
KNOWN AS "DEEP TIME"

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:53.230
AND IT WAS QUITE A
REVOLUTIONARY CONCEPT

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:55.670
WHERE WE WENT FROM
THINKING ABOUT THE EARTH

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.770
BEING THOUSANDS
OF YEARS OLD

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:01.670
INTO MILLIONS OF YEARS
OLD OR EVEN OLDER.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:06.330
AND IT WASN'T JUST
SICCAR POINT.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:10.600
THE EVIDENCE FOR SLOW
CHANGE WAS EVERYWHERE.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:15.370
THE GEOLOGISTS LOOKED AT
WATERFALLS AND SAW HOW THE

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:22.630
CONSTANT FLOW OF WATER HAD
ERODED THE SURROUNDING ROCK.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:26.170
THEY OBSERVED HOW RAIN
HAD INEXORABLY WORN AWAY

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:30.970
THE TOPS OF
MOUNTAINS...

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:34.170
AND HOW THE SLOW
MOVEMENT OF GLACIERS

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:39.730
HAD CARVED OUT
ENTIRE VALLEYS.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:45.370
THEY CAME TO A VIEW THAT THE
SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:49.930
IN THE CREATION OF
OUR PLANET WAS TIME.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.630
SO MUCH TIME, IN FACT, AS TO
MAKE OUR OWN HUMAN HISTORY

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:58.500
LOOK COMPLETELY AND
UTTERLY INSIGNIFICANT.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:06.770


00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:13.500
SO WHY DID THIS CONCEPT OF
DEEP TIME TAKE ROOT NOW?

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.070
THERE WAS THE EXPANSION
OF QUARRYING AND MINING,

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.770
EXPOSING MORE OF
THE HIDDEN EARTH.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:26.570
THE FOSSILS OF EXTINCT CREATURES
THAT WERE BEING UNCOVERED.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.130
AND THE EMERGENCE
OF GEOLOGY,

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:33.730
A NEW SCIENTIFIC
VIEW OF THE PLANET.

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:39.300
FINALLY THE PIECES WERE IN PLACE
TO TRY AND ANSWER THE QUESTION

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:44.870
OF HOW DID <i>WE</i> GET HERE -
A QUESTION BEING DRIVEN

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:50.230
BY A NEW FORCE IN
WESTERN EUROPE.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:54.800
THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
WAS A TIME OF RAPID

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.800
AND DIZZYING
CHANGE.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:05.030
GREAT CITIES BEGAN TO SPREAD
ACROSS VICTORIAN BRITAIN,

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:10.730
THEIR FACTORIES DRAWING IN
WORKERS FROM FAR AND WIDE.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.900
NEW RAILWAYS CRISSCROSSED
THE LANDSCAPE

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.430
CUTTING
JOURNEY TIMES

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:21.670
AND BRINGING CHEAP
GOODS TO THE MASSES.

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:26.470
IT WAS A WHIRLWIND OF NEW
IDEAS AND NEW METHODS,

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:30.870
AND ALL OF IT IN THE
NAME OF PROGRESS.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:38.800


00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.900
BELIEF IN PROGRESS WAS
ONE OF THE DEFINING

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:47.700
CHARACTERISTICS OF
THE VICTORIAN AGE.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.000
FACTORY BOSSES
FROM HUMBLE ORIGINS

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.730
NOW POSSESSED VAST
WEALTH AND POWER...

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:58.800
WHILE BRITAIN HERSELF
HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.970
THE WORLD'S LEADING
INDUSTRIAL NATION.

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:13.000


00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.370
IT WAS FROM THIS
WORLD OF PROGRESS

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:17.970
THAT A RADICAL TAKE
ON HOW WE GOT HERE

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:22.100
EXPLODED INTO
VICTORIAN SOCIETY.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:27.670


00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:30.670
IT PROPOSED THAT NOT ONLY
WERE SOCIETIES AND NATIONS

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:35.170
CAPABLE OF PROGRESSIVE
CHANGE, BUT ALSO NATURE.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:46.370


00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:51.870
IN 1844 THIS SLIM RATHER
ORDINARY LOOKING VOLUME

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.870
BECAME ONE OF THE MOST
CONTROVERSIAL BOOKS

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:57.300
OF THE
VICTORIAN AGE.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.470
CALLED <i>VESTIGES OF THE
NATURAL HISTORY OF CREATION</i>

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:05.430
IT WOULD GO ON TO SELL
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF COPIES.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:09.100
<i>VESTIGES</i> BECAME ONE OF THE
MOST WIDELY KNOWN BOOKS

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.800
IN VICTORIAN BRITAIN.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.430
IT WAS TALKED ABOUT EVERYWHERE
FROM BUCKINGHAM PALACE,

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.530
QUEEN VICTORIA
AND PRINCE ALBERT,

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:18.700
TO PUBS AND CLUBS AND
MECHANICS INSTITUTES

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.400
THROUGHOUT
THE COUNTRY.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.630
ADDING TO ITS MYSTIQUE WAS
THE FACT THAT ITS AUTHOR

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:27.130
MADE STRENUOUS EFFORTS
THROUGHOUT HIS LIFETIME

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:30.370
TO REMAIN STRICTLY
ANONYMOUS.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:36.700
HIS NAME WAS
ROBERT CHAMBERS.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:41.530
CHAMBERS WAS BORN WITH
SOMETHING QUITE UNUSUAL...

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.430
HE HAD SIX FINGERS
AND SIX TOES.

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:47.700
THE OPERATION TO TRY
AND CURE THIS WAS A FAILURE

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.430
AND IT REALLY
LEFT HIM LAME.

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:53.670
I THINK THIS TENDED TO
INCREASE THE TENDENCY HE HAD

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:57.000
TO BE VERY INTERESTED
IN BOOKS AND READING.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.630
HE DESCRIBES SPENDING
AFTERNOONS IN THE ATTIC

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:01.800
OF HIS HOUSE WHERE
HE'D ROAM THROUGH

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.670
THE ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA
"LIKE A BEE", HE SAID.

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:07.430
HE LOVED BOOKS.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:12.830
ALONG WITH HIS BROTHER,
CHAMBERS SET UP A SUCCESSFUL

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:17.500
PUBLISHING FIRM USING THE NEW
STEAM POWERED PRINTING PRESSES

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:24.370
TRANSFORMING
PUBLISHING AT THAT TIME.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:30.100
BUT HE WAS ALSO
A PROLIFIC WRITER.

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.700
ROBERT CHAMBERS WAS
ONE OF THE MOST SKILLED

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.000
AND KNOWLEDGEABLE AUTHORS
OF THE VICTORIAN PERIOD.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.770
HE KNEW HIS
AUDIENCE.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:41.200
THAT WAS PARTLY BY
WRITING OVER 30 BOOKS.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.270


00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:49.230
SO IN THE EARLY 1840'S HE
WITHDRAWS TO THE GOLFING TOWN

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:53.330
OF ST. ANDREWS AND DECIDES
TO WRITE A PHILOSOPHICAL WORK

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:58.470
THAT'S GOING TO DEAL WITH
THE FULL RANGE OF CREATION...

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:02.470
A BOOK IN WHICH CHAMBERS
PRESENTED A COMPELLING CASE

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:06.870
FOR THE NOTION THAT
SPECIES WERE NOT FIXED.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:09.170
THEY CHANGE.

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:15.170
THAT EVERYTHING HAD
DEVELOPED FROM AN EARLIER FORM.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:20.570
CHAMBERS CALLED THE
CONCEPT "TRANSMUTATION".

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:25.830
WE CALL IT
EVOLUTION.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:30.270
EVOLUTION EMERGED OUT
OF A WORLD OF PROGRESS

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:33.230
CONVINCED THAT ALL
THINGS ARE CAPABLE

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:38.500
OF CHANGE, OF
IMPROVEMENT.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:45.070
A HISTORY OF LIFE THAT WAS
AS DIVERSE AS IT WAS BAFFLING

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:52.370
AND A REALIZATION THAT THE EARTH
WAS ALMOST IMMEASURABLY OLD.

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:55.600
BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE
OF EVOLUTION TO THIS STORY

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.170
IS THAT IT NOW FORCED
PEOPLE TO CONFRONT THE

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:03.170
UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTION
OF HOW DID WE GET HERE.

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:08.830
BECAUSE INSTEAD OF BEING SET
APART FROM THE REST OF CREATION

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:13.270
ROBERT CHAMBERS WAS
SAYING THAT WE WERE SIMPLY

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:17.830
AN EXTENSION OF IT.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:22.230
FOR A SOCIETY WHERE
MANY STILL BELIEVED HUMANS

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:26.800
HELD A SPECIAL PLACE IN
GOD'S CREATION, THIS CLAIM

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:34.130
THAT WE WERE DESCENDED FROM
ANIMALS WAS DEEPLY SHOCKING.

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:39.270
IT BECAME CLEAR THAT A LOT
OF MEN OF SCIENCE ESPECIALLY

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.330
WERE VERY WORRIED
ABOUT THE BOOK;

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:43.530
NOT ALL OF THEM,
BUT MOST OF THEM...

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:47.000
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM
OF SPECIFIC FACTS IN <i>VESTIGES.</i>

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.400
THEY BEGAN TO BLAST AWAY AT
INDIVIDUAL POINTS IN THE BOOK.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:57.170
BUT DESPITE THE CONTROVERSY,
OR MORE LIKELY <i>BECAUSE</i> OF IT,

00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:02.600
THE PUBLIC SIMPLY COULDN'T
GET ENOUGH OF THE BOOK.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.730
<i>VESTIGES,</i> QUITE SIMPLY,
PUT EVOLUTION ON THE MAP.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:10.200
NOT JUST FOR THE
VICTORIANS BUT FOR US.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:16.830
BUT FOR ALL ITS SUCCESS, WHAT
CHAMBERS' BOOK DIDN'T DO

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.430
WAS COME UP WITH
ANY EXPLANATION

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:22.700
OF WHY EVOLUTION
HAPPENS.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:27.070
THE MAN WHO WOULD GO ON
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:32.700
WAS OF COURSE
CHARLES DARWIN.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.630
A KEEN GEOLOGIST
AND ARDENT BELIEVER

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:39.170
IN THE EARTH'S ANTIQUITY,
DARWIN HAD BEEN WORKING ON

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:42.000
HIS OWN THEORY OF
EVOLUTION FOR SEVERAL YEARS

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.270
WHEN <i>VESTIGES</i>
FIRST APPEARED.

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:50.530
BUT IT WOULD BE A FURTHER
15 YEARS, BY WHICH TIME

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:53.900
MUCH OF THE FUSS SURROUNDING
EVOLUTION HAD DIED DOWN,

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.270
BEFORE DARWIN FELT
READY TO PUBLISH.

00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:10.770


00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:16.100
HIS EXPLANATION FOR HOW ANIMALS
EVOLVE HAD ITS ROOTS IN THE SAME

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.970
INDUSTRIAL LANDSCAPE FROM WHICH
CHAMBERS' BOOK HAD EMERGED.

00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:28.130
ACCORDING TO DARWIN, LIFE WAS
ONE LONG STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:31.670
AND JUST AS INDUSTRY
INVOLVED COMPETITION

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.930
BETWEEN MANUFACTURERS,
SO NATURE WAS DRIVEN

00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:39.000
BY COMPETITION BETWEEN
INDIVIDUAL ORGANISMS.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.070


00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:47.830
IN THE SAME WAY THAT NEW
TECHNOLOGY COULD GIVE

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:53.000
ONE FACTORY AN EDGE OVER
ANOTHER, SO IT WAS IN NATURE.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.470
ANY TRAIT THAT GAVE AN
ORGANISM AN EDGE OVER ITS RIVAL

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:04.530
WOULD PREVAIL AND BECOME MORE
COMMON IN LATER GENERATIONS

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:15.900
GRADUALLY GIVING RISE TO THE
APPEARANCE OF NEW SPECIES...

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:24.070
A MECHANISM FOR CHANGE THAT
DARWIN CALLED NATURAL SELECTION.

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:28.470
BUT WHILE DARWIN HAD
IDENTIFIED THE CRUCIAL ROLE

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:32.770
PLAYED BY THE ENVIRONMENT IN
FORCING CHANGE WITHIN SPECIES,

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.070
WHAT HE HAD NO WAY
OF KNOWING WAS

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:37.870
THE INCREDIBLE EXTENT
TO WHICH ALL NEW LIFE

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:42.330
HAS BEEN INFLUENCED
BY OUR PLANET...

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:47.170
A KNOWLEDGE THAT HAS
ONLY RELATIVELY RECENTLY

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:50.300
COME TO LIGHT.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:36:06.870


00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:10.530
WHILE BIOLOGY RACED AHEAD
IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY,

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:17.600
GEOLOGY HAD MORE OR LESS
SETTLED INTO A ROUTINE.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:26.900
STONES WERE DATED, FOSSILS
EXAMINED, COLLECTIONS EXPANDED.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:29.930
BUT AS SO OFTEN IN
THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:31.900
IT'S THE NON
SPECIALISTS,

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:35.930
THE ENTHUSIASTS
WHO SHAKE THINGS UP.

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:40.100
ONE SUCH ENTHUSIAST WAS
THE GERMAN METEOROLOGIST

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.900
ALFRED WEGENER WHO WOULD
SHOCK THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.700
BY PROPOSING A RADICAL AND
CONTROVERSIAL NEW THEORY

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:51.730
ABOUT THE FORCES
THAT SHAPED THE EARTH...

00:36:51.730 --> 00:37:00.100
FORCES SO POWERFUL AS TO
HAVE SHAPED EVEN LIFE ITSELF.

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:04.770
THE STORY GOES THAT WEGENER
WAS LOOKING AT AN ATLAS

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:08.230
WHEN HE WAS STRUCK BY AN
UNCANNY SIMILARITY IN SHAPE

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:12.200
BETWEEN THE COASTLINES OF
SOUTH AMERICA AND AFRICA.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.100
SO WELL DID THEY
APPEAR TO FIT

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:19.500
THAT IT LOOKED AS IF
THEY HAD ONCE BEEN JOINED.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:24.130
NOW WHILE OTHERS HAD
ALSO NOTICED THIS,

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:28.430
WEGENER HAD
AN EXPLANATION...

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:31.700
ONE INSPIRED BY HIS
METEOROLOGICAL FIELDWORK

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.970
IN THE ARCTIC
CIRCLE.

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:41.170


00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:44.300
WEGENER PROPOSED THAT ALL
THE SEVEN GREAT CONTINENTS

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:48.100
HAD BEEN CLUMPED TOGETHER
IN A SINGLE SUPERCONTINENT

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:55.370
THAT HE CALLED PANGAEA,
MEANING "ALL LANDS".

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:57.930
AND THEN, LIKE THE
HUGE FLOATING ICEBERGS

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:00.400
HE'D SEEN ON HIS FIELD
TRIPS TO GREENLAND,

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:06.330
PANGAEA HAD
SIMPLY DRIFTED APART.

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:13.830
BUT INSTEAD OF BLOCKS OF ICE
WEIGHING A FEW THOUSAND TONS,

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:17.900
WEGENER WAS TALKING
ABOUT GREAT SLABS OF ROCK

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.500
WEIGHING LITERALLY
TRILLIONS OF TONS.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:29.330


00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:31.830
THE PROBLEM FOR
WEGENER WAS THAT

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:34.800
HE HAD NO WAY TO
EXPLAIN HIS THEORY.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:40.730
NO HARD EVIDENCE WITH WHICH
TO CONVINCE THE SKEPTICS.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:44.730
AND SO THE
THEORY WAS SHELVED.

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:47.130
WEGENER WENT BACK
TO HIS METEOROLOGY

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:49.430
AND THAT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN THAT,

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:52.800
BUT FOR A SERIES OF
UNEXPECTED DISCOVERIES

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.330
MADE DURING THE
HEIGHT OF THE COLD WAR.

00:38:55.330 --> 00:39:00.730


00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:03.470
AS THE NUCLEAR ARMS
RACE GATHERED MOMENTUM,

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:06.400
SO BOTH THE UNITED STATES
AND THE SOVIET UNION

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.970
FOUND THEMSELVES
INVOLVED IN A DEADLY GAME

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:13.470
OF CAT AND MOUSE DEEP
BENEATH THE OCEAN.

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:16.230
A GAME THAT CALLED FOR A
MUCH MORE ACCURATE PICTURE

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:20.330
OF THIS UNDERWATER
LANDSCAPE.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:28.570
AND SO THE SCIENTISTS ROLLED UP
THEIR SLEEVES AND GOT TO WORK.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:36.600
THEY BEGAN TAKING THOUSANDS OF
PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE OCEAN FLOOR.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:42.670
ECHO SOUNDINGS PLOTTED THE RISE
AND FALL OF DEEP SEA RIDGES

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:45.400
WHILE DRILL RODS WERE
SENT DOWN TO ESTABLISH

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:50.230
THE COMPOSITION
OF THE SEA BED.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:56.000
BUT IN MAPPING THE OCEANS
THE SCIENTISTS DISCOVERED

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.900
SOMETHING
ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.870
THEY FOUND THAT THE SEA
FLOOR DIDN'T CONSIST OF

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:07.500
ONE THICK UNIFORM CRUST
AS WAS ONCE THOUGHT,

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.730
BUT A NUMBER OF THIN
INTERLOCKING PLATES.

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:15.530
AND THAT THE BOUNDARIES
TO THESE PLATES FEATURED

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:29.270
MOUNTAIN RANGES, DEEP RIFT
VALLEYS, EVEN VOLCANOES.

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:32.870
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF,
THIS ENTIRE LANDSCAPE

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:36.200
WAS FLOATING ON A
BED OF MOLTEN ROCK

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:40.630
JUST AS WEGENER
HAD PREDICTED.

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:47.170


00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:49.970
AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY
SEE EVIDENCE OF THIS

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:53.230
AT SOMEWHERE CALLED
THINGVELLIR IN ICELAND,

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:55.430
WIDELY REGARDED AS
ONE OF THE GEOLOGICAL

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:57.470
WONDERS OF
THE WORLD.

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:05.170


00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:07.530
THINGVELLIR'S VERY
IMPORTANT TO GEOLOGISTS

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:09.730
BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE
ONLY PLACES ON EARTH

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:11.770
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY
SEE THE JUNCTURE

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:15.830
OF TWO VERY LARGE
TECTONIC PLATES.

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:18.670
TO ONE SIDE OF THINGVELLIR
IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.330
THE EURASIAN PLATE
STRETCHING ALL THE WAY

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:26.600
FROM ICELAND TO THE
EASTERN COAST OF CHINA.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:30.300
ON THE OTHER, THE
NORTH AMERICAN PLATE

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.300
WHICH EXTENDS
7,000 KILOMETERS

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:40.330
IN THE OPPOSITE
DIRECTION.

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:43.370
NOW IF YOU WERE TO
STAND HERE LONG ENOUGH,

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.530
SAY A FEW
THOUSAND YEARS,

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:47.900
YOU'D BEGIN TO NOTICE
THAT THE GAP BETWEEN

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:54.300
NORTH AMERICA AND
EURASIA WAS GETTING WIDER.

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:58.130
PETE LAFEMINA IS PART OF
THE TEAM THAT HAS BEEN

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:03.470
MONITORING THIS SPREADING
FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS.

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:07.400
ONE OF THE HYPOTHESES
THAT WEGENER HAD IN 1912

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.630
WAS THAT CURRENTS
IN THE MANTLE,

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:12.000
WHAT WE NOW KNOW
AS MANTLE CONVECTION,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.400
WERE ACTUALLY HELPING TO
MOVE THE TECTONIC PLATES.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:21.600
SO TODAY WE HAVE
MANTLE MATERIAL

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.800
THAT COMES UP AT
MID OCEAN RIDGES,

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.000
FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT BENEATH
OUR FEET HERE AT THINGVELLIR,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.700
AND THAT DRIVES
THE PLATES APART.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.030
WITH THE AID OF
MODERN TECHNOLOGY

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:37.730
PETE IS ABLE TO
RECORD THIS MOVEMENT.

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:41.200
THINGVELLIR IS SPREADING AT
SEVEN MILLIMETERS PER YEAR.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.270
WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE
WE'RE ABLE TO MEASURE IT

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:46.570
QUITE PRECISELY USING THE
GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM.

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:49.800
WE CAN SET UP A GPS RECEIVER
ON ONE SIDE OF THE VALLEY

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.600
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE AND
MEASURE VERY PRECISELY

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.400
HOW MUCH THE VALLEY
IS OPENING OVER TIME.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.900
OVER THE TIMEFRAME
OF OUR MEASUREMENTS

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:03.700
WE'RE SEEING MILLIMETER
PER YEAR TYPES OF RATES.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:07.330
BUT OVER GEOLOGIC TIME
THE VALLEY HAS OPENED

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:11.870
AT LEAST 20
KILOMETERS.

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:15.600
AS THESE PLATES ARE
BEING DRIVEN APART,

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.870
AT ANOTHER LOCATION THEY
HAVE TO BE CONVERGING.

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:22.670
OVER HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS OF YEARS

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:25.930
THIS PUSHING AND PULLING
OF THE EARTH'S PLATES

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:28.930
HAS HELPED TRANSFORM
THE FACE OF OUR PLANET,

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:32.300
A NEVER-ENDING CYCLE
OF GEOLOGICAL CHANGE

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:37.200
TO WHICH WEGENER GAVE THE
NAME "CONTINENTAL DRIFT".

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:44.070


00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:52.130
BUT CONTINENTAL DRIFT HAS DONE
MUCH MORE THAN SHAPE THE EARTH.

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:55.530
IT ALSO TAKES US CLOSER
TO SOLVING THE MYSTERY

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:59.800
OF HOW WE GOT HERE.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.570
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN
THE EARTH MOVES IN THIS WAY

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:08.700
THE RESULTS CAN ALSO
BE INCREDIBLY VIOLENT.

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.930
WHEN THE EARTH'S
PLATES COLLIDE

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:15.700
THEY CAN TRIGGER VOLCANIC
ERUPTIONS SO POWERFUL

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:20.400
AS TO BLOCK OUT THE
SUN FOR MONTHS ON END.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:25.130


00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:28.130
AS THOSE SAME PLATES
GRIND AGAINST EACH OTHER

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:34.770
SO THEY CAN ALSO CAUSE
DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKES

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:38.670
WHICH THEMSELVES CAN
SPAWN MEGA TSUNAMIS

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:42.630
THAT WILL DESTROY
ANYTHING IN THEIR WAY.

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:48.200


00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:52.030
BUT WHILE IT'S EASY TO IMAGINE
THAT ALL THIS VIOLENT UPHEAVAL

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:55.430
HAS BROUGHT WITH IT NOTHING
BUT DEATH AND DESTRUCTION,

00:44:55.430 --> 00:45:00.800
THE TRUTH IS
VERY DIFFERENT.

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.530
IT'S NOW CLEAR THAT THROUGHOUT
OUR 4.5 BILLION YEAR HISTORY

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:09.100
THE VIOLENCE OF OUR PLANET
HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY CENTRAL

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:13.900
TO THE CREATION OF NEW LIFE
- MAKING CONTINENTAL DRIFT

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:18.530
ONE OF THE GREAT
DRIVERS OF EVOLUTION.

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:24.100
AND HERE ARE JUST A
COUPLE OF EXAMPLES.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:27.730
SOME 30 MILLION YEARS
AGO THE PLATE BOUNDARIES

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:32.670
SEPARATING AFRICA FROM
ARABIA BEGAN TO PULL APART

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:38.130
CAUSING THE LAND IN
BETWEEN TO FALL AWAY.

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:41.500
A 5,000 KILOMETER GASH
IN THE EARTH'S CRUST

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:46.970
THAT WE KNOW AS THE
EAST AFRICAN RIFT VALLEY.

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:52.300
AND AS A NEW LANDSCAPE OF
BROKEN SAVANNA FORMED

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.870
IT ALLOWED THE ANCESTORS
OF MANY OF TODAY'S ANIMALS

00:45:55.870 --> 00:46:00.930
TO GAIN A FOOTHOLD
AND FLOURISH.

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:07.370


00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:11.370
AND THEN THERE'S OUR CLIMATE
WHERE IT TURNS OUT THAT

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:16.000
CONTINENTAL DRIFT HAS
ALSO PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.830
ACCELERATING THE ONSET OF ICE
AGES BY PUSHING LAND TOWARDS

00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:25.800
THE POLES AND ALTERING THE
FLOW OF OCEAN CURRENTS...

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:31.500
CHANGES WHICH HAVE
FORCED ANIMALS TO ADAPT

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:35.670
IN THE MOST
REMARKABLE OF WAYS.

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:39.300
AND JUST OCCASIONALLY
WE'RE SUBJECTED

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:43.870
TO VIOLENCE FROM WAY
BEYOND OUR PLANET

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:50.400
SO EXTREME THAT MANY SPECIES
ARE WIPED OUT ALTOGETHER.

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:55.970
ONLY FOR OTHERS
TO TAKE THEIR PLACE.

00:46:55.970 --> 00:47:02.170


00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:05.430
IT'S NOW CLEAR THAT
THE STORY OF LIFE

00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:08.200
AND THE STORY
OF OUR PLANET,

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.830
WHICH WERE ONCE
SEEN AS SEPARATE,

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:13.970
ARE IN FACT
INTRINSICALLY LINKED.

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:20.400


00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.300
AND WHAT OF US?

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:26.370
HOW DID <i>WE</i>
GET HERE?

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:32.170
WELL, WE'RE JUST THE LATEST IN
A LONG LINE OF LUCKY SURVIVORS

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:41.200
BORN OUT OF DEATH, DESTRUCTION
AND THE IMMENSITY OF DEEP TIME.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:45.670
AND IF THIS RANDOM EXPERIMENT
THAT IS LIFE ON EARTH

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:48.200
WERE TO BE
RUN AGAIN

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:54.600
WE MIGHT NEVER
EVEN SHOW UP.

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.600
