00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.530


2
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.130
I am sorry, sir, that Ihave hinder'd you;

3
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.900
But, I protest, he had thechain of me,

4
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.600
Though most dishonestly hedoth deny it.

5
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.500
How is the man esteemedhere in the city?

6
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.670
Of very reverendreputation, sir,

7
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.400
Of credit infinite, highlybeloved,

8
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.400
Second to none that liveshere in the city:

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.470
His word might bear mywealth at any time.

10
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.270
Speak softly; yonder, as Ithink, he walks.

11
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.470
'Tis so; and that selfchain about his neck

12
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.570
Which he forswore mostmonstrously to have.

13
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.500
Good sir, draw near to me,I'll speak to him.

14
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.970
Signior Antipholus, Iwonder much

15
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.470
That you would put me tothis shame and trouble;

16
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.970
And, not without somescandal to yourself,

17
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.630
With circumstance andoaths so to deny

18
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.770
This chain which now youwear so openly:

19
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.670
Beside the charge, theshame, imprisonment,

20
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.870
You have done wrong tothis my honest friend,

21
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.700
Who, but for staying onour controversy,

22
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.400
Had hoisted sail and putto sea to-day:

23
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.430
This chain you had of me;can you deny it?

24
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.200
I think I had; I never diddeny it.

25
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.630
Yes, that you did, sir,and forswore it too.

26
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.200
Who heard me to deny it orforswear it?

27
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.270
These ears of mine, thouknow'st did hear thee.

28
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.430
Fie on thee, wretch! 'tispity that thou livest

29
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.300
To walk where any honestman resort.

30
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.000
Thou art a villain toimpeach me thus:

31
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.830
I'll prove mine honour andmine honesty

32
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.430
Against thee presently, ifthou darest stand.

33
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.170
I dare, and do defy theefor a villain.

34
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.900
Hold, hurt him not, forGod's sake! he is mad.

35
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.370
Some get within him, takehis sword away:

36
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.370
Bind Dromio too, and bearthem to my house.

37
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.370
Run, master, run;

38
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.530
for God's sake, take a house!

39
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.670
This is some priory. In,or we are spoil'd!

40
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.430
Be quiet, people. Whereforethrong you hither?

41
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.070
To fetch my poordistracted husband hence.

42
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.130
Let us come in, that wemay bind him fast

43
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.070
And bear him home for hisrecovery.

44
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.170
I knew he was not in hisperfect wits.

45
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.130
I am sorry now that I diddraw on him.

46
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.400
How long hath thispossession held the man?

47
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.830
This week he hath beenheavy, sour, sad,

48
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.470
And much different fromthe man he was;

49
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.770
But till this afternoonhis passion

50
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.900
Ne'er brake into extremityof rage.

51
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.500
Hath he not lost muchwealth by wreck of sea?

52
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.100
Buried some dear friend?

53
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.770
Hath not else his eye

54
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.830
Stray'd his affection inunlawful love?

55
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.800
A sin prevailing much inyouthful men,

56
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.870
Who give their eyes theliberty of gazing.

57
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.000
Which of these sorrows ishe subject to?

58
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.970
To none of these, exceptit be the last;

59
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.500
Namely, some love thatdrew him oft from home.

60
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.330
You should for that havereprehended him.

61
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.170
Why, so I did.

62
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.830
Ay, but not rough enough.

63
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.000
As roughly as my modestywould let me.

64
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.670
Haply, in private.

65
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.900
And in assemblies too.

66
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.370
Ay, but not enough.

67
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.700
It was the copy of ourconference:

68
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.670
In bed he slept not for myurging it;

69
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.170
At board he fed not for myurging it;

70
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.800
Alone, it was the subjectof my theme;

71
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.600
In company I oftenglanced it;

72
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.800
Still did I tell him itwas vile and bad.

73
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.400
And thereof came it thatthe man was mad.

74
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.230
The venom clamours of ajealous woman

75
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.070
Poisons more deadly than amad dog's tooth.

76
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.900
It seems his sleeps werehinder'd by thy railing,

77
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.130
And therefore comes itthat his head is light.

78
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.900
Thou say'st his meat wassauced with thy upbraidings:

79
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.600
Unquiet meals make illdigestions;

80
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.330
Thereof the raging fire offever bred;

81
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.700
And what's a fever but afit of madness?

82
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.800
Thou say'st his sports werehinderd by thy brawls:

83
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.630
Sweet recreation barr'd,what doth ensue

84
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.500
But moody and dullmelancholy,

85
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.230
Kinsman to grim andcomfortless despair,

86
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.030
And at her heels a hugeinfectious troop

87
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.470
Of pale distemperaturesand foes to life?

88
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.700
In food, in sport andlife-preserving rest

89
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.400
To be disturb'd, would mador man or beast:

90
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.570
The consequence is thenthy jealous fits

91
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.730
Have scared thy husbandfrom the use of wits.

92
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.800
She never reprehended himbut mildly,

93
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.300
When he demean'd himselfrough, rude and wildly.

94
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.730
Why bear you these rebukesand answer not?

95
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.600
She did betray me to myown reproof.

96
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.230
Good people enter and layhold on him.

97
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.800
No, not a creature entersin my house.

98
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.670
Then let your servantsbring my husband forth.

99
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.630
Neither: he took thisplace for sanctuary,

100
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.400
And it shall privilege himfrom your hands

101
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.470
Till I have brought him tohis wits again,

102
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.330
Or lose my labour inassaying it.

103
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.230
I will attend my husband,be his nurse,

104
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.830
Diet his sickness, for itis my office,

105
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.430
And will have no attorneybut myself;

106
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.600
And therefore let me havehim home with me.

107
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.970
Be patient; for I will notlet him stir

108
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.700
Till I have used theapproved means I have,

109
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.930
With wholesome syrups,drugs and holy prayers,

110
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.870
To make of him a formalman again:

111
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.700
It is a branch and parcelof mine oath,

112
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.000
A charitable duty of myorder.

113
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.330
Therefore depart and leavehim here with me.

114
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.530
I will not hence and leavemy husband here:

115
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.200
And ill it doth beseemyour holiness

116
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.970
To separate the husbandand the wife.

117
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:42.800
Be quiet and depart: thoushalt not have him.

118
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.430
Complain unto the duke ofthis indignity.

119
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.200
Come, go: I will fallprostrate at his feet

120
00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.830
And never rise until mytears and prayers

121
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.800
Have won his grace to comein person hither

122
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.030
And take perforce myhusband from the abbess.

123
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.330
By this, I think, the dialpoints at five:

124
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.870
Anon, I'm sure, the dukehimself in person

125
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.400
Comes this way to themelancholy vale,

126
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.870
The place of death andsorry execution,

127
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.770
Behind the ditches of theabbey here.

128
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:20.700
Upon what cause?

129
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.570
To see a reverendSyracusian merchant,

130
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.570
Who put unluckily intothis bay

131
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.930
Against the laws andstatutes of this town,

132
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.070
Beheaded publicly for hisoffence.

133
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.330
See where they come: wewill behold his death.

134
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.600
Kneel to the duke beforehe pass the abbey.

135
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.300
Yet once again proclaim itpublicly,

136
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.270
If any friend will pay thesum for him,

137
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.900
He shall not die; so muchwe tender him.

138
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:25.770
Justice, most sacred duke,against the abbess!

139
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.070
The abbess?

140
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.170
She is a virtuous and areverend lady:

141
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:34.770
It cannot be that she hathdone thee wrong.

142
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:39.170
May it please your grace,Antipholus, my husband,

143
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.930
Whom I made lord of me andall I had,

144
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:44.900
At your importantletters,--this ill day

145
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.000
A most outrageous fit ofmadness took him;

146
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.270
That desperately he hurriedthrough the street,

147
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.300
With him his bondman, allas mad as he--

148
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.700
Doing displeasure to thecitizens

149
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.070
By rushing in theirhouses, bearing thence

150
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.330
Rings, jewels, any thinghis rage did like.

151
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.470
Once did I get him boundand sent him home,

152
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.800
Anon, I wot not by whatstrong escape,

153
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.170
He broke from those thathad the guard of him;

154
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.430
Chased us away; till,raising of more aid,

155
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.470
We came again to bindthem. Then they fled

156
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.970
Into this abbey, whitherwe pursued them:

157
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.930
And here the abbess shutsthe gates on us

158
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.230
And will not suffer us tofetch him out,

159
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.030
Therefore, most graciousduke, with thy command

160
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.530
Let him be brought forthand borne hence for help.

161
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.470
Long since thy husbandserved me in my wars,

162
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.200
And I to thee engaged aprince's word,

163
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.230
When thou didst make himmaster of thy bed,

164
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.470
To do him all the graceand good I could.

165
00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.930
Go, some of you, knock atthe abbey-gate

166
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.130
And bid the lady abbesscome to me.

167
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.370
I will determine thisbefore I stir.

168
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.370
O mistress, mistress,shift and save yourself!

169
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.300
My master and his man areboth broke loose,

170
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.870
Beaten the maids a-row andbound the doctor

171
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.100
Whose beard they have singedoff with brands of fire;

172
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.000
And ever, as it blazed,they threw on him

173
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.330
Great pails of puddledmire to quench the hair:

174
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.930
My master preachespatience to him

175
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.930
and the while his man withscissors nicks him like a fool,

176
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.070
And sure, unless you sendsome present help,

177
00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.030
Between them they willkill the conjurer.

178
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.300
Peace, fool! thy masterand his man are here,

179
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.700
And that is false thoudost report to us.

180
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.770
Mistress, upon my life, Itell you true;

181
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.430
I have not breathed almostsince I did see it.

182
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.230
He cries for you, andvows, if he can take you,

183
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.830
To scorch your face and todisfigure you.

184
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.700
Hark, hark! I hear him,mistress. fly, be gone!

185
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.130
Come, stand by me; fearnothing.

186
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.030
Guard with halberds!

187
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.400
Ay me, it is my husband!

188
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.970
Witness you,

189
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.070
That he is borne aboutinvisible:

190
00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.930
Even now we housed him inthe abbey here;

191
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.630
And now he's there, pastthought of human reason.

192
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:27.970
Justice, most graciousduke, O, grant me justice!

193
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.170
Even for the service thatlong since I did thee,

194
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.970
When I bestrid thee in thewars and took

195
00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.900
Deep scars to save thylife; even for the blood

196
00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.200
That then I lost for thee,now grant me justice.

197
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.470
Unless the fear of deathdoth make me dote,

198
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.630
I see my son Antipholusand Dromio.

199
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.700
Justice, sweet prince,against that woman there!

200
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.770
She whom thou gavest to meto be my wife,

201
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.030
That hath abused anddishonour'd me

202
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.500
Even in the strength andheight of injury!

203
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.030
Beyond imagination is thewrong

204
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.400
That she this day hathshameless thrown on me.

205
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.330
Discover how, and thoushalt find me just.

206
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:11.200
This day, great duke, sheshut the doors upon me,

207
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.870
While she with harlotsfeasted in my house.

208
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:22.700
A grievous fault! Say,woman, didst thou so?

209
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.330
No, my good lord: myself,he and my sister

210
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.370
To-day did dine together.So befall my soul

211
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.770
As this is false heburdens me withal!

212
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.230
Ne'er may I look on day,nor sleep on night,

213
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.830
But she tells to yourhighness simple truth!

214
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.900
O perjured woman! They areboth forsworn:

215
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.500
In this the madman justlychargeth them.

216
00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.870
My liege, I am advisedwhat I say,

217
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.230
Neither disturbed with theeffect of wine,

218
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.430
Nor heady-rash, provokedwith raging ire,

219
00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:01.170
This woman lock'd me outthis day from dinner:

220
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.230
That goldsmith there, werehe not pack'd with her,

221
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.670
Could witness it, for hewas with me then;

222
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.030
Who parted with me to gofetch a chain,

223
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.430
Promising to bring it tothe Porpentine,

224
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:18.700
Where Balthazar and I diddine together.

225
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.130
Our dinner done, and henot coming thither,

226
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.530
I went to seek him: in thestreet I met him

227
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.270
And in his company thatgentleman.

228
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.800
There did this perjuredgoldsmith swear me down

229
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.670
That I this day of himreceived the chain,

230
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:41.500
Which, God he knows, I sawnot: for the which

231
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.130
He did arrest me with anofficer.

232
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.770
I did obey, and sent mypeasant home

233
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:55.030
For certain ducats: hewith none return'd

234
00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.130
Then fairly I bespoke theofficer

235
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.930
To go in person with me tomy house.

236
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.370
By the way we met

237
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.030
My wife, her sister, and arabble more

238
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.570
Of vile confederates.Along with them

239
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:15.030
They brought one Pinch, ahungry lean-faced villain,

240
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:18.570
A dead-looking man: thispernicious slave,

241
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.300
Forsooth, took on him as aconjurer,

242
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.730
And, gazing in mine eyes,feeling my pulse,

243
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.270
Cries out, I was possess'd.Then all together

244
00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:29.130
They fell upon me, boundme, bore me thence

245
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.730
And in a dark and dankishvault at home

246
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.530
There left me and my man,both bound together;

247
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.970
Till, gnawing with myteeth my bonds in sunder,

248
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.330
I gain'd my freedom, andimmediately

249
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.670
Ran hither to your grace;whom I beseech

250
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.870
To give me amplesatisfaction

251
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:49.800
For these deep shames andgreat indignities.

252
00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:58.170
My lord, in truth, thusfar I witness with him,

253
00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:01.200
That he dined not at home,but was lock'd out.

254
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.070
But had he such a chain ofthee or no?

255
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.570
He had, my lord: and whenhe ran in here,

256
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.630
These people saw the chainabout his neck.

257
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.100
Besides, I will be swornthese ears of mine

258
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.800
Heard you confess you hadthe chain of him

259
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.100
After you first forsworeit on the mart:

260
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.700
And thereupon I drew mysword on you;

261
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.400
And then you fled intothis abbey here,

262
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.470
From whence, I think, youare come by miracle.

263
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:28.570
I never came within theseabbey-walls,

264
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.300
Nor ever didst thou drawthy sword on me:

265
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.830
I never saw the chain, sohelp me Heaven!

266
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.300
And this is false youburden me withal.

267
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:42.270
Why, what an intricateimpeach is this!

268
00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.000
I think you all have drunkof Circe's cup.

269
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.600
If here you housed him,here he would have been;

270
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.500
If he were mad, he wouldnot plead so coldly:

271
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.200
You say he dined at home;the goldsmith here

272
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.400
Denies that saying.

273
00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.870
Sirrah, what say you?

274
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:13.830
Sir, he dined with herthere, at the Porpentine.

275
00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.830
He did, and from my fingersnatch'd that ring.

276
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.030
'Tis true, my liege; thisring I had of her.

277
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:34.430
Saw'st thou him enter atthe abbey here?

278
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.030
As sure, my liege, as I dosee your grace.

279
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:43.370
Why, this is strange. Gocall the abbess hither.

280
00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.730
I think you are all matedor stark mad.

281
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:53.230
Most mighty duke,vouchsafe me speak a word:

282
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.630
Haply I see a friend willsave my life

283
00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:01.300
And pay the sum that maydeliver me.

284
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.770
Speak freely, Syracusian,what thou wilt.

285
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.470
Is not your name, sir,call'd Antipholus?

286
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.300
And is not that yourbondman, Dromio?

287
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.770
Within this hour I was hisbondman sir,

288
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.630
But he, I thank him,gnaw'd in two my cords:

289
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:24.270
Now am I Dromio and hisman unbound.

290
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.800
I am sure you both of youremember me.

291
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.430
Ourselves we do remember,sir, by you;

292
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:35.830
For lately we were bound,as you are now

293
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.730
You are not Pinch'spatient, are you, sir?

294
00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:42.300
Why look you strange onme? you know me well.

295
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.670
I never saw you in my lifetill now.

296
00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.370
O, grief hath changed mesince you saw me last,

297
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.000
And careful hours withtime's deformed hand

298
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.130
Have written strangedefeatures in my face:

299
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:58.270
But tell me yet, dost thounot know my voice?

300
00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.330
Neither.

301
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.570
Dromio, nor thou?

302
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.400
No, trust me, sir, nor I.

303
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.100
I am sure thou dost.

304
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.370
Ay, sir, but I amsure I do not;

305
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.730
and whatsoever a mandenies,

306
00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.200
you are now bound tobelieve him.

307
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.530
Not know my voice! Otime's extremity,

308
00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.600
Hast thou so crack'd andsplitted my poor tongue

309
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.230
In seven short years, thathere my only son

310
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:28.270
Knows not my feeble key ofuntuned cares?

311
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.770
And all the conduits of myblood froze up,

312
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.170
Yet hath my night of lifesome memory,

313
00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:39.100
My wasting lamps somefading glimmer left,

314
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:44.970
My dull deaf ears a littleuse to hear:

315
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:48.600
All these old witnesses--Icannot err--

316
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.030
Tell me thou art my sonAntipholus.

317
00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.130
I never saw my father inmy life.

318
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:57.570
But seven years since, inSyracusa, boy,

319
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:02.800
Thou know'st we parted:but perhaps, my son,

320
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.300
Thou shamest toacknowledge me in misery.

321
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.930
The duke and all that knowme in the city

322
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:09.700
Can witness with me thatit is not so

323
00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.830
I ne'er saw Syracusa in mylife.

324
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.030
I tell thee, Syracusian,twenty years

325
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.900
Have I been patron toAntipholus,

326
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.630
During which time he ne'ersaw Syracusa:

327
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.670
I see thy age and dangersmake thee dote.

328
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:30.300
Most mighty duke, behold aman much wrong'd.

329
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.170
I see two husbands, ormine eyes deceive me.

330
00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:04.430
One of these men is Geniusto the other;

331
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.970
And so of these. Which isthe natural man,

332
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:11.200
And which the spirit? whodeciphers them?

333
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.830
I, sir, am Dromio; commandhim away.

334
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.330
I, sir, am Dromio; pray,let me stay.

335
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:24.300
AEgeon art thou not? orelse his ghost?

336
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.100
O, my old master! who hathbound him here?

337
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:31.670
Whoever bound him, I willloose his bonds

338
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.530
And gain a husband by hisliberty.

339
00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:44.230
Speak, old AEgeon, if thoube'st the man

340
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:48.770
That hadst a wife oncecall'd AEmilia

341
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.970
That bore thee at a burdentwo fair sons:

342
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.130
O, if thou be'st the sameAEgeon, speak,

343
00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:02.200
And speak unto the sameAEmilia!

344
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.600
If I dream not, thou artAEmilia:

345
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.930
If thou art she, tell mewhere is that son

346
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.330
That floated with thee onthe fatal raft?

347
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.900
By men of Epidamnumhe and I

348
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.600
And the twin Dromio allwere taken up;

349
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.600
But by and by rudefishermen of Corinth

350
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.770
By force took Dromio andmy son from them

351
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.970
And me they left withthose of Epidamnum.

352
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.200
What then became of them Icannot tell

353
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.870
I to this fortune that yousee me in.

354
00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:44.930
Why, here begins hismorning story right;

355
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.700
These two Antipholuses,these two so like,

356
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.030
And these two Dromios, onein semblance,--

357
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.230
Besides her urging of herwreck at sea,--

358
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.700
These are the parents tothese children,

359
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.470
Which accidentally are mettogether.

360
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:10.570
Antipholus, thou camestfrom Corinth first?

361
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:12.930
No, sir, not I; I camefrom Syracuse.

362
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:19.570
Stay, stand apart; I knownot which is which.

363
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.000
I came from Corinth, mymost gracious lord,--

364
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.070
And I with him.

365
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.130
Brought to this town bythat most famous warrior,

366
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.130
Menaphon, your mostrenowned uncle.

367
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.900
Which of you two did dinewith me to-day?

368
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.030
I, gentle mistress.

369
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:37.930
And are not you myhusband?

370
00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.500
No; I say nay to that.

371
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.700
And so do I; yet did shecall me so:

372
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.100
And this fair gentlewoman,her sister here,

373
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.870
Did call me brother.

374
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:48.070
What I told you then,

375
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.070
I hope I shall haveleisure to make good;

376
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.400
If this be not a dream Isee and hear.

377
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.400
That is the chain, sir,which you had of me.

378
00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.330
I think it be, sir; I denyit not.

379
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.300
And you, sir, for thischain arrested me.

380
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.030
I think I did, sir; I denyit not.

381
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.970
I sent you money, sir, tobe your bail,

382
00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:19.330
By Dromio; but I think hebrought it not.

383
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.370
No, none by me.

384
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.930
This purse of ducats Ireceived from you,

385
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:25.970
And Dromio, my man, didbring them me.

386
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.830
I see we still did meeteach other's man,

387
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:29.670
And I was ta'en for him,and he for me,

388
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.470
And thereupon these errorsare arose.

389
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.470
These ducats pawn I for myfather here.

390
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:45.930
It shall not need; thyfather hath his life.

391
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.070
Sir, I must have thatdiamond from you.

392
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:59.300
There, take it; and muchthanks for my good cheer.

393

She now shall be mysister, not my wife.
