00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.530


2
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.130
I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;

3
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.900
But, I protest, he had the chain of me,

4
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.600
Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.

5
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.500
How is the man esteemed here in the city?

6
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.670
Of very reverend reputation, sir,

7
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.400
Of credit infinite, highly beloved,

8
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.400
Second to none that lives here in the city:

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.470
His word might bear my wealth at any time.

10
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.270
Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.

11
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.470
'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck

12
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.570
Which he forswore most monstrously to have.

13
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.500
Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.

14
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.970
Signior Antipholus, I wonder much

15
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.470
That you would put me to this shame and trouble;

16
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.970
And, not without some scandal to yourself,

17
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.630
With circumstance and oaths so to deny

18
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.770
This chain which now you wear so openly:

19
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.670
Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,

20
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.870
You have done wrong to this my honest friend,

21
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.700
Who, but for staying on our controversy,

22
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.400
Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:

23
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.430
This chain you had of me; can you deny it?

24
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.200
I think I had; I never did deny it.

25
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.630
Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.

26
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.200
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?

27
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.270
These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee.

28
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.430
Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest

29
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.300
To walk where any honest man resort.

30
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.000
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:

31
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.830
I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty

32
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.430
Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.

33
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.170
I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.

34
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.900
Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.

35
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.370
Some get within him, take his sword away:

36
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.370
Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.

37
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.370
Run, master, run;

38
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.530
for God's sake, take a house!

39
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.670
This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd!

40
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.430
Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?

41
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.070
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.

42
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.130
Let us come in, that we may bind him fast

43
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.070
And bear him home for his recovery.

44
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.170
I knew he was not in his perfect wits.

45
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.130
I am sorry now that I did draw on him.

46
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.400
How long hath this possession held the man?

47
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.830
This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,

48
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.470
And much different from the man he was;

49
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.770
But till this afternoon his passion

50
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.900
Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.

51
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.500
Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?

52
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.100
Buried some dear friend?

53
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.770
Hath not else his eye

54
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.830
Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?

55
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.800
A sin prevailing much in youthful men,

56
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.870
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.

57
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.000
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?

58
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.970
To none of these, except it be the last;

59
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.500
Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.

60
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.330
You should for that have reprehended him.

61
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.170
Why, so I did.

62
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.830
Ay, but not rough enough.

63
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.000
As roughly as my modesty would let me.

64
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.670
Haply, in private.

65
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.900
And in assemblies too.

66
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.370
Ay, but not enough.

67
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.700
It was the copy of our conference:

68
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.670
In bed he slept not for my urging it;

69
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.170
At board he fed not for my urging it;

70
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.800
Alone, it was the subject of my theme;

71
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.600
In company I often glanced it;

72
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.800
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.

73
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.400
And thereof came it that the man was mad.

74
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.230
The venom clamours of a jealous woman

75
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.070
Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.

76
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.900
It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,

77
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.130
And therefore comes it that his head is light.

78
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.900
Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:

79
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.600
Unquiet meals make ill digestions;

80
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.330
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;

81
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.700
And what's a fever but a fit of madness?

82
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.800
Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:

83
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.630
Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue

84
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.500
But moody and dull melancholy,

85
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.230
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,

86
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.030
And at her heels a huge infectious troop

87
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.470
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?

88
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.700
In food, in sport and life-preserving rest

89
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.400
To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:

90
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.570
The consequence is then thy jealous fits

91
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.730
Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.

92
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.800
She never reprehended him but mildly,

93
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.300
When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.

94
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.730
Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?

95
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.600
She did betray me to my own reproof.

96
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.230
Good people enter and lay hold on him.

97
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.800
No, not a creature enters in my house.

98
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.670
Then let your servants bring my husband forth.

99
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.630
Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,

100
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.400
And it shall privilege him from your hands

101
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.470
Till I have brought him to his wits again,

102
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.330
Or lose my labour in assaying it.

103
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.230
I will attend my husband, be his nurse,

104
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.830
Diet his sickness, for it is my office,

105
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.430
And will have no attorney but myself;

106
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.600
And therefore let me have him home with me.

107
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.970
Be patient; for I will not let him stir

108
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.700
Till I have used the approved means I have,

109
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.930
With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,

110
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.870
To make of him a formal man again:

111
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.700
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,

112
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.000
A charitable duty of my order.

113
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.330
Therefore depart and leave him here with me.

114
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.530
I will not hence and leave my husband here:

115
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.200
And ill it doth beseem your holiness

116
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.970
To separate the husband and the wife.

117
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:42.800
Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.

118
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.430
Complain unto the duke of this indignity.

119
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.200
Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet

120
00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.830
And never rise until my tears and prayers

121
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.800
Have won his grace to come in person hither

122
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.030
And take perforce my husband from the abbess.

123
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.330
By this, I think, the dial points at five:

124
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.870
Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person

125
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.400
Comes this way to the melancholy vale,

126
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.870
The place of death and sorry execution,

127
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.770
Behind the ditches of the abbey here.

128
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:20.700
Upon what cause?

129
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.570
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,

130
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.570
Who put unluckily into this bay

131
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.930
Against the laws and statutes of this town,

132
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.070
Beheaded publicly for his offence.

133
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.330
See where they come: we will behold his death.

134
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.600
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.

135
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.300
Yet once again proclaim it publicly,

136
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.270
If any friend will pay the sum for him,

137
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.900
He shall not die; so much we tender him.

138
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:25.770
Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!

139
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.070
The abbess?

140
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.170
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:

141
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:34.770
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.

142
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:39.170
May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,

143
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.930
Whom I made lord of me and all I had,

144
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:44.900
At your important letters,--this ill day

145
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.000
A most outrageous fit of madness took him;

146
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.270
That desperately he hurried through the street,

147
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.300
With him his bondman, all as mad as he--

148
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.700
Doing displeasure to the citizens

149
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.070
By rushing in their houses, bearing thence

150
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.330
Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.

151
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.470
Once did I get him bound and sent him home,

152
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.800
Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,

153
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.170
He broke from those that had the guard of him;

154
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.430
Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,

155
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.470
We came again to bind them. Then they fled

156
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.970
Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:

157
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.930
And here the abbess shuts the gates on us

158
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.230
And will not suffer us to fetch him out,

159
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.030
Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command

160
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.530
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.

161
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.470
Long since thy husband served me in my wars,

162
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.200
And I to thee engaged a prince's word,

163
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.230
When thou didst make him master of thy bed,

164
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.470
To do him all the grace and good I could.

165
00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.930
Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate

166
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.130
And bid the lady abbess come to me.

167
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.370
I will determine this before I stir.

168
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.370
O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!

169
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.300
My master and his man are both broke loose,

170
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.870
Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor

171
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.100
Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;

172
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.000
And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him

173
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.330
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:

174
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.930
My master preaches patience to him

175
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.930
and the while his man with scissors nicks him like a fool,

176
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.070
And sure, unless you send some present help,

177
00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.030
Between them they will kill the conjurer.

178
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.300
Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,

179
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.700
And that is false thou dost report to us.

180
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.770
Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;

181
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.430
I have not breathed almost since I did see it.

182
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.230
He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,

183
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.830
To scorch your face and to disfigure you.

184
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.700
Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!

185
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.130
Come, stand by me; fear nothing.

186
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.030
Guard with halberds!

187
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.400
Ay me, it is my husband!

188
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.970
Witness you,

189
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.070
That he is borne about invisible:

190
00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.930
Even now we housed him in the abbey here;

191
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.630
And now he's there, past thought of human reason.

192
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:27.970
Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!

193
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.170
Even for the service that long since I did thee,

194
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.970
When I bestrid thee in the wars and took

195
00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.900
Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood

196
00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.200
That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.

197
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.470
Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,

198
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.630
I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.

199
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.700
Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!

200
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.770
She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,

201
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.030
That hath abused and dishonour'd me

202
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.500
Even in the strength and height of injury!

203
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.030
Beyond imagination is the wrong

204
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.400
That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.

205
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.330
Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.

206
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:11.200
This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,

207
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.870
While she with harlots feasted in my house.

208
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:22.700
A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?

209
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.330
No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister

210
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.370
To-day did dine together. So befall my soul

211
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.770
As this is false he burdens me withal!

212
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.230
Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,

213
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.830
But she tells to your highness simple truth!

214
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.900
O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:

215
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.500
In this the madman justly chargeth them.

216
00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.870
My liege, I am advised what I say,

217
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.230
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,

218
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.430
Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,

219
00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:01.170
This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:

220
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.230
That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,

221
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.670
Could witness it, for he was with me then;

222
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.030
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,

223
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.430
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,

224
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:18.700
Where Balthazar and I did dine together.

225
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.130
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,

226
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.530
I went to seek him: in the street I met him

227
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.270
And in his company that gentleman.

228
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.800
There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down

229
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.670
That I this day of him received the chain,

230
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:41.500
Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which

231
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.130
He did arrest me with an officer.

232
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.770
I did obey, and sent my peasant home

233
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:55.030
For certain ducats: he with none return'd

234
00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.130
Then fairly I bespoke the officer

235
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.930
To go in person with me to my house.

236
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.370
By the way we met

237
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.030
My wife, her sister, and a rabble more

238
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.570
Of vile confederates. Along with them

239
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:15.030
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,

240
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:18.570
A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,

241
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.300
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,

242
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.730
And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,

243
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.270
Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together

244
00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:29.130
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence

245
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.730
And in a dark and dankish vault at home

246
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.530
There left me and my man, both bound together;

247
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.970
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,

248
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.330
I gain'd my freedom, and immediately

249
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.670
Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech

250
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.870
To give me ample satisfaction

251
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:49.800
For these deep shames and great indignities.

252
00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:58.170
My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,

253
00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:01.200
That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.

254
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.070
But had he such a chain of thee or no?

255
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.570
He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,

256
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.630
These people saw the chain about his neck.

257
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.100
Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine

258
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.800
Heard you confess you had the chain of him

259
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.100
After you first forswore it on the mart:

260
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.700
And thereupon I drew my sword on you;

261
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.400
And then you fled into this abbey here,

262
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.470
From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.

263
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:28.570
I never came within these abbey-walls,

264
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.300
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:

265
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.830
I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!

266
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.300
And this is false you burden me withal.

267
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:42.270
Why, what an intricate impeach is this!

268
00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.000
I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.

269
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.600
If here you housed him, here he would have been;

270
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.500
If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:

271
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.200
You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here

272
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.400
Denies that saying.

273
00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.870
Sirrah, what say you?

274
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:13.830
Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.

275
00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.830
He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.

276
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.030
'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.

277
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:34.430
Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?

278
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.030
As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.

279
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:43.370
Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.

280
00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.730
I think you are all mated or stark mad.

281
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:53.230
Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:

282
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.630
Haply I see a friend will save my life

283
00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:01.300
And pay the sum that may deliver me.

284
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.770
Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.

285
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.470
Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?

286
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.300
And is not that your bondman, Dromio?

287
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.770
Within this hour I was his bondman sir,

288
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.630
But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:

289
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:24.270
Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.

290
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.800
I am sure you both of you remember me.

291
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.430
Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;

292
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:35.830
For lately we were bound, as you are now

293
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.730
You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?

294
00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:42.300
Why look you strange on me? you know me well.

295
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.670
I never saw you in my life till now.

296
00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.370
O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,

297
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.000
And careful hours with time's deformed hand

298
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.130
Have written strange defeatures in my face:

299
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:58.270
But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?

300
00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.330
Neither.

301
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.570
Dromio, nor thou?

302
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.400
No, trust me, sir, nor I.

303
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.100
I am sure thou dost.

304
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.370
Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not;

305
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.730
and whatsoever a man denies,

306
00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.200
you are now bound to believe him.

307
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.530
Not know my voice! O time's extremity,

308
00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.600
Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue

309
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.230
In seven short years, that here my only son

310
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:28.270
Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?

311
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.770
And all the conduits of my blood froze up,

312
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.170
Yet hath my night of life some memory,

313
00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:39.100
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,

314
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:44.970
My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:

315
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:48.600
All these old witnesses--I cannot err--

316
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.030
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.

317
00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.130
I never saw my father in my life.

318
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:57.570
But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,

319
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:02.800
Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,

320
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.300
Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.

321
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.930
The duke and all that know me in the city

322
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:09.700
Can witness with me that it is not so

323
00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.830
I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.

324
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.030
I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years

325
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.900
Have I been patron to Antipholus,

326
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.630
During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:

327
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.670
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.

328
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:30.300
Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.

329
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.170
I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.

330
00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:04.430
One of these men is Genius to the other;

331
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.970
And so of these. Which is the natural man,

332
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:11.200
And which the spirit? who deciphers them?

333
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.830
I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.

334
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.330
I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.

335
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:24.300
AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?

336
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.100
O, my old master! who hath bound him here?

337
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:31.670
Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds

338
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.530
And gain a husband by his liberty.

339
00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:44.230
Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man

340
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:48.770
That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia

341
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.970
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:

342
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.130
O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,

343
00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:02.200
And speak unto the same AEmilia!

344
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.600
If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:

345
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.930
If thou art she, tell me where is that son

346
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.330
That floated with thee on the fatal raft?

347
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.900
By men of Epidamnum he and I

348
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.600
And the twin Dromio all were taken up;

349
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.600
But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth

350
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.770
By force took Dromio and my son from them

351
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.970
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.

352
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.200
What then became of them I cannot tell

353
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.870
I to this fortune that you see me in.

354
00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:44.930
Why, here begins his morning story right;

355
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.700
These two Antipholuses, these two so like,

356
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.030
And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--

357
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.230
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--

358
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.700
These are the parents to these children,

359
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.470
Which accidentally are met together.

360
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:10.570
Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?

361
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:12.930
No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.

362
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:19.570
Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.

363
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.000
I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--

364
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.070
And I with him.

365
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.130
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,

366
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.130
Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.

367
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.900
Which of you two did dine with me to-day?

368
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.030
I, gentle mistress.

369
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:37.930
And are not you my husband?

370
00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.500
No; I say nay to that.

371
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.700
And so do I; yet did she call me so:

372
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.100
And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,

373
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.870
Did call me brother.

374
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:48.070
What I told you then,

375
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.070
I hope I shall have leisure to make good;

376
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.400
If this be not a dream I see and hear.

377
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.400
That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.

378
00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.330
I think it be, sir; I deny it not.

379
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.300
And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.

380
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.030
I think I did, sir; I deny it not.

381
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.970
I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,

382
00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:19.330
By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.

383
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.370
No, none by me.

384
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.930
This purse of ducats I received from you,

385
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:25.970
And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.

386
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.830
I see we still did meet each other's man,

387
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:29.670
And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,

388
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.470
And thereupon these errors are arose.

389
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.470
These ducats pawn I for my father here.

390
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:45.930
It shall not need; thy father hath his life.

391
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.070
Sir, I must have that diamond from you.

392
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:59.300
There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.

393
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.230
Renowned duke,

394
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.000
vouchsafe to take the pains

395
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.600
To go with us into the abbey here

396
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.030
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:

397
00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:27.670
And all that are assembled in this place,

398
00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:32.030
That by this sympathized one day's error

399
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:36.670
Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,

400
00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:40.400
And we shall make full satisfaction.

401
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:51.100
Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail

402
00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:56.570
Of you, my sons; and till this present hour

403
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.800
My heavy burden ne'er delivered.

404
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.430
The duke, my husband and my children both,

405
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:12.200
And you the calendars of their nativity,

406
00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:21.430
Go to a gossips' feast and go with me;

407
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:30.170
After so long grief, such festivity!

408
00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:40.370
With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.

409
00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:51.300
Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?

410
00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:54.400
Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?

411
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.130
Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.

412
00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:00.400
He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:

413
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.700
Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:

414
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.100
Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.

415
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.670
There is a fat friend at your master's house,

416
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:32.000
That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:

417
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.430
She now shall be my sister, not my wife.

418
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:39.400
Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:

419
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:42.900
I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.

420
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.600
Will you walk in to see their gossiping?

421
00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.800
Not I, sir; you are my elder.

422
00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:50.300
That's a question: how shall we try it?

423
00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.870
We'll draw cuts for the senior:

424
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:53.700
till then lead thou first.

425
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.970
Nay, then, thus:

426
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:59.070
We came into the world like brother and brother;

427
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:04.630
And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.

428
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:20.730
(music and celebration)

429
00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.730
