WEBVTT

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
AS THE 21ST
CENTURY DAWNED,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
THE LITERATURE THAT HAD
DEFINED LATIN AMERICAN

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
CULTURE AND IDENTITY
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
APPROACHED YET ANOTHER
CRUCIAL JUNCTURE.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
THE 20TH CENTURY HAD
BEEN A SPECTACULARLY

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
SUCCESSFUL PERIOD FOR
WRITERS FROM THE CONTINENT.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
THE LATIN AMERICAN BOOM
- WHICH FEATURED WRITERS

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
SUCH AS JORGE LUIS
BORGES, JULIO CORTAZAR,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
AND CARLOS FUENTES
- HAD LAUNCHED

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
LATIN AMERICA ONTO THE
WORLD LITERARY STAGE.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
MAGICAL REALISM -
THE STYLE OR GENRE

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
IN WHICH FANTASTICAL
ELEMENTS APPEAR

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
IN AN OTHERWISE
REALISTIC SETTING -

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
BECAME A WILDLY POPULAR
TRANSCULTURAL MEME.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
CRITICS AND READERS
FROM AROUND THE WORLD

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
STOOD UP AND TOOK NOTICE,
AS DID HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
WHICH TRANSFORMED MANY
WORKS OF THIS PERIOD

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
INTO FEATURE FILMS.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
LITERATURE OF THE NEW
WORLD HAD A LONGSTANDING

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
TRADITION OF CONTRARINESS
AND VOLATILITY,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
YET IN THE YEARS
AFTER THE BOOM

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
IT HAD BECOME
ALMOST PREDICTABLE,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
A VICTIM OF ITS
OWN SUCCESS.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
LATIN AMERICAN LITERATURE
BECAME NEARLY SYNONYMOUS

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
WITH THE AESTHETICS
OF MAGICAL REALISM

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
AND WITH ITS
MAIN PRACTITIONERS.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
INNOVATION WAS REPLACED
WITH COMPLACENCY.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
LATIN AMERICAN WRITERS

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
HAD TO WRESTLE WITH THE
CHALLENGES OF SUCCESS.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:01.000
*

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:13.000
*

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
IT CAN BE CONFIDENTLY
STATED THAT COMPLACENCY

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
FLIES DIRECTLY IN THE
FACE OF LATIN AMERICAN

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
LITERATURE'S HISTORY,
A HISTORY THAT IS

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
OVERFLOWING WITH WRITERS
WHO CHALLENGED CONVENTION

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
AND DEFIED THE EASY
CLASSIFICATIONS OF GENRE.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
AND EVEN AS THE
21ST CENTURY DAWNED,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
MANY OF THE SAME WRITERS
WHO HAD FUELED THE BOOM

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
BECAME ADVOCATES FOR
NONCONFORMIST AUTHORS

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
WHO WERE DISENCHANTED
WITH THE STATUS QUO.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
WHILE INTERNATIONALLY
RECOGNIZED LATIN

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
AMERICAN AUTHORS CONTINUE
WRITING TO THIS DAY

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
WITH GREAT SUCCESS
AND SKILL, THEY ALSO

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
SERVE AS BELLWETHERS
OF WHAT WILL COME.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
THEY POINT THE WAY
TOWARDS LESSER-KNOWN

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
AUTHORS WHO ARE
WAITING IN THE WINGS.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
THESE ESTABLISHED
WRITERS ARE, IN EFFECT,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
PATRONS OF AN
ALTERNATIVE LITERATURE

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
- A LITERATURE
DEDICATED TO NARRATIVE

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
EXPERIMENTATION AND TO
RETHINKING LATIN AMERICA

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
AS A RIOTOUSLY
DIVERSE CONTINENT,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
ONE MADE COHERENT BY SHARED
DREAMS AND NIGHTMARES.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
SO, IN THE CLASSICALLY
PARADOXICAL FASHION

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
THAT DISTINGUISHES THE
WRITING OF SOUTH AMERICA,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
RADICAL CHANGE COMES
ABOUT THROUGH THE AGENCY

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
OF AUTHORS WHO
ARE THEMSELVES

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
LEGITIMIZED AND
LIONIZED BY CRITICS,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
ACADEMIA, AND THE
PUBLISHING MARKET.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
WHO ARE THE WRITERS
THAT FORESHADOW

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
A NEW
NARRATIVE TREND?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
THEY INCLUDE
NAMES SUCH AS

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
CESAR AIRA
AND RICARDO PIGLIA,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
AND THE PLAYWRIGHT
GRISELDA GAMBARO.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
IN MEXICO YOU FIND SERGIO
PITOL, MARGO GLANTZ,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
MARIO BELLATIN
AND JUAN VILLORO;

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
IN COLOMBIA, FERNANDO
VALLEJO, ALONG WITH

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
OTHER AUTHORS BELONGING
TO THE SICARESCA GENRE.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
WE FIND ROBERTO
BOLANO IN CHILE.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
THERE ARE THE WRITERS KNOWN
AS THE "CRACK GENERATION"

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
- JORGE VOLPI OR
IGNACIO PADILLA.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
MEMBERS OF THE
MCONDO GROUP,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
INCLUDING ALBERTO
FUGUET IN CHILE;

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
RODRIGO FRESAN
IN ARGENTINA;

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
EDMUNDO PAZ
SOLDAN IN BOLIVIA;

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
AND JORDI SOLER
FROM MEXICO.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
AND THERE
ARE THE POETS:

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
MAROSA DI
GIORGIO IN URUGUAY,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
PEDRO LEMEBEL
IN CHILE,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
AND MARCELO
COHEN IN ARGENTINA.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
LIKE SO MANY GENERATIONS
OF WRITERS BEFORE THEM,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
SEVERAL CONTEMPORARY
LATIN AMERICAN AUTHORS

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
HAVE PLUMBED THEIR LIFE
STORIES AS SOURCE MATERIAL

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
FOR THEIR NOVELS, PLAYS,
SHORT STORIES, AND POEMS.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
THEY PLUNDERED THEIR OWN
PASTS TO PLOT OUT NEW

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
FICTIONAL DIRECTIONS IN
WHICH CREDIBILITY IS MORE

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
OF A LITERARY CLICHE THAN
A COMPOSITIONAL NECESSITY.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
WRITERS SUCH AS FERNANDO
VALLEJO, ROBERTO BOLANO,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
SERGIO PITOL,
MARIO BELLATIN,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
AND CESAR AIRA FALL
INTO THIS CATEGORY.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
THEY OFTEN INSERT
THEMSELVES AS CHARACTERS

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
IN THEIR TALES, AND THE
"I" THAT THEY ASSUME

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
OFFERS THE PERSPECTIVE OF
AN OMNIPRESENT SPECTER

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
- OPEN TO AND OBSERVING
ANY AND ALL EVENTS,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000
FROM TAME DOMESTIC AFFAIRS
TO RIOTOUS STREET SCENES.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
ALTHOUGH SERGIO
PITOL BELONGS TO

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
THE SAME GENERATION
AS CARLOS FUENTES

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
AND ELENA
PONIATOWSKA,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
RECOGNITION OF HIS
TALENTS CAME MUCH LATER.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
HIS WORK STARTED TO BECOME
POPULAR IN THE LATE 80'S,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
ESPECIALLY AMONG
YOUNG WRITERS.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
DURING THE 80'S, PITOL
WAS A CULTIC WRITER;

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
IN THE 90'S HE WAS
STILL A CULTIC WRITER,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
AND HE WAS
A REFINED WRITER.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
AMERICAN YOUNG PEOPLE
HAVE ALWAYS ADORED HIM,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
MAINLY BECAUSE OF WHAT
HE DID IN THE 80'S.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
IT WAS EASIER TO ESTABLISH
CONNECTIONS IN THE 90'S,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.000
AND THE MARKET RULES OF
THIS PERIOD WERE CLEARER.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
THAT IS TO SAY, THE LOCAL
MARKET OF THIS DECADE WAS

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
A MATRIX OF MANY FACTORS;
ONE OF THEM WAS THE

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
ADVANCEMENT OF
TECHNOLOGY IN THE 90'S,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
WHICH MEANT THAT
THERE WERE ONLY

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000
A FEW PRINT RUNS
OF A PUBLICATION.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
HE HAD BEEN AFFLICTED
WITH MALARIA

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
AND THEN ORPHANED
AT AN EARLY AGE,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
LIVING WITH VARIOUS
GRANDPARENTS AND AUNTS

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
IN A TRANSIENT LIFE WHERE
BOOKS FORMED HIS REFUGE.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
HE READ THE WORKS OF JULES
VERNE, WHO INSPIRED HIM

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
TO INTRODUCE FANTASY
INTO HIS OWN NOVELS.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
IN TWO OF
HIS BOOKS,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
PASSION FOR THE PLOT
AND THE ART OF FLIGHT,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
HE INVESTIGATES THE STATE
OF MEXICAN CULTURE.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
THE LAST CHAPTER
OF THE ART OF FLIGHT

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
RECOUNTS THE AUTHOR'S
TRIP TO THE TROUBLED

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
REGION OF CHIAPAS AND
PRESENTS A CONCILIATORY

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
VISION OF THE
CONFLICT THERE,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
ONE FOUNDED ON THE
NECESSITY OF UNDERSTANDING

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
OPPOSING VIEWS AND OF THE
KALEIDOSCOPIC REALITY

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:56.000
OF THE MEXICAN
INDIANS' EXPERIENCE.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
SOMETIMES, AFTER SEEING
 PAINTINGS OF BECKMANN,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I HAVE FELT THE TEMPTATION
 TO INCORPORATE INTO

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
MY STORIES SITUATIONS AND
 CHARACTERS WHOSE SIMPLE

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
PROXIMITY COULD BE
 CONSIDERED A SCANDAL;

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
TO ESTABLISH IN A RAPT
 FIERCENESS THE THREADS

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
NECESSARY TO PUT INTO
 MOTION ALL KINDS OF

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
INCOMPATIBLE INCIDENTS
 UNTIL A PLOT IS CREATED.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
TO DREAM ABOUT WRITING A
 NOVEL FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
THE MAJORITY OF
 THEM ONLY APPARENT;

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
TO CREATE,
 HERE AND THERE,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
DEEP SPOTS OF DARKNESS,
 CRACKS, ABYSMAL DEPTHS.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
NOTED FOR THEIR GREAT
NARRATIVE AGILITY,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
SERGIO PITOL'S
WORKS CONTAIN

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL ASIDES,
REFLECTIONS ON ART,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
REPORTS ON
CURRENT EVENTS,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
AND IMPRESSIONS
FROM HIS TRAVELS

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
AS A DIPLOMAT AND
CULTURAL ATTACHE.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
HIS BEST-KNOWN
WORKS INCLUDE

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
THE SOUND OF A FLUTE,
 FLOWER GAMES,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
AND THE
 MEPHISTO WALTZ.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
THREE OF HIS NOVELS
WERE PUBLISHED TOGETHER

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
UNDER THE TITLE
 CARNAVAL TRIPTYCH,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
WITH A PROLOGUE BY
THE ITALIAN AUTHOR

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
ANTONIO TABUCCHI.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
THE CHILEAN WRITER ROBERTO
BOLANO SHOOK THE CONTINENT

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
WITH FRANK AND
SHOCKING NOVELS.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
ALTHOUGH HE IS OFTEN
LINKED WITH WRITERS

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
SUCH AS CESAR AIRA
OR RICARDO PIGLIA,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
HIS PROGRAM CAN BE SEEN
AS GOING EVEN FURTHER,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
DEEP INTO THE DARK CORE OF
LATIN AMERICAN HISTORY.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
HIS ITINERANT LIFE
ALLOWED HIM TO EXPERIENCE

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
THE CONTINENT FIRST HAND,
WHILE HIS NATIVE CHILE

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
GROANED UNDER THE
REPRESSIVE DICTATORSHIP

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
OF AUGUSTO PINOCHET.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
IN 1973 HE JOINED
THE RESISTANCE

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
AND ENDED
UP IN PRISON.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
HE THEN WENT INTO
EXILE IN EL SALVADOR

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
BEFORE MOVING TO
EUROPE IN 1977,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
WHERE HE TOOK ON A
VARIETY OF JOBS,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
EKING OUT AN EXISTENCE BY
WINNING LITERARY CONTESTS.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
IN THE LATE 90'S HE BEGAN
PUBLISHING AT A FURIOUS PACE.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
IT WAS AT THIS TIME
THAT HIS SEMINAL WORK,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
THE SAVAGE DETECTIVES,
WAS RELEASED.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
THIS IS HIS BEST KNOWN
NOVEL, OFTEN COMPARED TO

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
JULIO CORTAZAR'S BRILLIANT
AND INFLUENTIAL NOVEL

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
HOPSCOTCH.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
BOTH OFFER HIGHLY
FRAGMENTED NARRATIVES.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
IN THE SAVAGE DETECTIVES,
EACH INDIVIDUAL SCENE

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
SHIFTS TO A DIFFERENT
REGISTER - BE IT A

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
CRONICA, AUTOBIOGRAPHY,
OR ABSURDISM -

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
CREATING A KALEIDOSCOPIC
EXPERIENCE

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
OF DIVERSITY AND
INTERCONNECTION.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN
ARTISTIC FLIGHT OF FANCY

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.000
IS IN FACT AN
EXISTENTIAL GAMBIT.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
BOLANO IS ANOTHER WRITER
THAT HAS EXPERIENCED

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
SEVERAL
DETECTIVE FORMS.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I THINK OF THE
 SAVAGE DETECTIVES

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
THAT HAS A PERFECTLY
BORGIAN STYLE,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:06.000
WHICH COULD BE THE NAZI
 LITERATURE IN AMERICA.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
BOLANO IS A
RECREATIONAL WRITER.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I THINK OF THE LONG NOVELS
WHERE HE MAKES FUN OF

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
THE AVANT-GARDES, OF THE
LITERARY LEGACY AND,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
AT THE SAME TIME, HE IS A
DEFINITE METICULOUS WRITER

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
REGARDING THE CONTROL OF
PROSE AS IN THE RESPECT,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
THE DESIRE TO RESPECT
ONE'S ANCESTORS IN THE

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
LATIN AMERICAN
LITERARY TRADITION.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
BOLANO INSERTS
HISTORICAL FIGURES

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
AND CONTEMPORARY
WRITERS INTO HIS PLOT,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
ALONG WITH HIS ALTER EGO,
ARTURO BELANO.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
BELANO AND HIS PARTNER,
ULISES LIMA,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
ARE THE FEARSOME
DETECTIVES OF THE TITLE,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
AND THEY SET OUT TO SEARCH
FOR CESAREA TINAJERO -

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
A MYSTERIOUS WRITER WHO
DISAPPEARED IN MEXICO

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
IN THE YEARS IMMEDIATELY
AFTER THE REVOLUTION.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
THE INVESTIGATION GOES
ON FOR TWENTY YEARS,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000
FROM 1976 TO 1996.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
CLARA CABEZA, PARQUE
 HUNDIDO, MEXICO DF,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
OCTOBER OF 1995.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I WAS THE SECRETARY
 OF OCTAVIO PAZ.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE
 THE WORK THAT I HAD.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
TO WRITE LETTERS, TO
 LOCATE UNAVAILABLE

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
MANUSCRIPTS, TO PHONE
 THE COLLABORATORS

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
AT THE MAGAZINE, TO
 OBTAIN BOOKS THAT WERE

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
ONLY IN ONE OR TWO
 AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
AFTER TWO YEARS OF
 WORKING FOR DON OCTAVIO,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
I ALREADY HAD A CHRONIC
 HEADACHE THAT ATTACKED ME

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
AT 11:00 AM AND IT DID
 NOT GO AWAY, EVEN THOUGH

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
I TOOK PAINKILLERS,
 UNTIL 6:00 PM.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
DISTANT STAR WAS BOLANO'S
FIFTH NOVEL, ONE THAT

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
DWELLS ON A VERY DIFFERENT
KIND OF INVESTIGATION.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
HERE, HE IS IN SEARCH
OF ANOTHER CHARISMATIC

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
CHARACTER SHROUDED BY
THE MISTS OF LEGEND.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
THE MAN IS CARLOS WIEDER,
AN AVIATOR AND SELF-STYLED

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
POET WHO ACQUIRES A
DUBIOUS CELEBRITY BY

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
SKYWRITING THREATENING
PROCLAMATIONS FROM HIS

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
AIRPLANE IN THE AIRSPACE
ABOVE SANTIAGO DE CHILE.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
HE ALSO HAS A
STASH OF PHOTOS

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
HE TOOK OF THE VICTIMS
TORTURED AND EXECUTED

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
DURING PINOCHET'S COUP.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
BOLANO'S INTELLIGENT
AND IRONIC STYLE IS

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
A GAME OF MIRRORS
BETWEEN TRUTH AND MYTH,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
REALITY AND ILLUSION,
FACTS AND CONJECTURES,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000
APOCRYPHAL AND
HISTORICAL CHARACTERS.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
IN THE NOVEL BY NIGHT IN
 CHILE, HIS MAIN CHARACTER

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
IS SEBASTIAN URRUTIA
LACROIX, A PRIEST,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
MIDDLING POET, AND
LITERARY CRITIC

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
WHO REVIEWS THE CRUCIAL
JUNCTURES OF HIS LIFE

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
DURING A NIGHT OF
FEVER-INDUCED DELIRIUM.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
THE WORK CONSISTS
OF A SINGLE,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
SUSTAINED MONOLOGUE
IN WHICH CHARACTERS

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
RANGING FROM
PABLO NERUDA

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
TO THE GERMAN NOVELIST,
ERNST JUNGER, APPEAR.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
EVEN PINOCHET HIMSELF
MAKES AN APPEARANCE.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
BOLANO'S NOVEL ENTITLED
 NAZI LITERATURE IN AMERICA

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
IS COMPOSED OF BRIEF
DESCRIPTIONS OF THE LIVES

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
AND WORKS OF
NAZI AUTHORS

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
WHO LIVED ON THE
AMERICAN CONTINENT -

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
AUTHORS WHO, INCIDENTALLY,
NEVER EXISTED.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
BUT IT IS HIS
EPIC NOVEL, 2666,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
PUBLISHED AFTER
THE AUTHOR'S DEATH

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
AT THE AGE OF 50, THAT
SECURES BOLANO'S POSITION

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
IN THE PANTHEON
OF MODERN WRITERS.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED AS
FIVE SEPARATE NOVELS,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
2666 BEGINS WITH THE
HUNT FOR A GERMAN WRITER

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
WHO HAS DISAPPEARED.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
IT VEERS INTO THE STORY OF
A SERIAL KILLER WHO PREYS

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000
ON FEMALE FACTORY WORKERS
IN A MEXICAN BORDER TOWN.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
THE YEAR IN THE TITLE IS
THE VANISHING POINT FOR

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
HISTORY, A DISCIPLINE
THAT BOLANO DEFINES AS,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
"SIMPLE WHORE, WHO HAS
NO DETERMINING MOMENTS,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
BUT RATHER IS A
PROLIFERATION OF INSTANTS,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
OF BREVITIES THAT
COMPETE WITH ONE ANOTHER

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
IN THEIR MONSTROSITY".

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
THE FIRST TIME THAT
JEAN-CLAUDE PELLETIER

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
READ BENNO VON ARCHIMBOLDI
WAS CHRISTMAS OF 1980,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
IN PARIS, WHERE HE WAS
STUDYING GERMAN LITERATURE

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
AT THE UNIVERSITY, AT
THE AGE OF NINETEEN.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
THE BOOK WAS
 D' ARSONVAL.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
YOUNG PELLETIER
IGNORED THE FACT

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
THAT THE NOVEL WAS
PART OF A TRILOGY

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
(COMPOSED OF THE GARDEN,
ABOUT THE ENGLISH;

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
THE LEATHER MASK,
ABOUT THE POLISH;

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
AND D' ARSONVAL WHICH WAS
EVIDENTLY ABOUT THE FRENCH),

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
BUT THAT IGNORANCE
OR THAT EMPTINESS

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
OR THAT BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
CARELESSNESS

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
- ONLY ATTRIBUTED TO
HIS EXTREME YOUTH -

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
DID NOT REDUCE THE
GLARE OF ADMIRATION

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
THE NOVEL
PRODUCED IN HIM.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
THE ARGENTINEAN WRITER
CESAR AIRA'S STYLE

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
IS FAST-PACED AND
FORWARD-LEANING,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
DEVOURING GENRES AND STYLES
WITH VORACIOUS EASE.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
AIRA IS AN ADVOCATE
OF IMPROVISATION

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
AND OF EXUBERANT
NARRATIVE ENERGY,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
ALWAYS MOVING THE
STORY FORWARD,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
NEVER LANGUISHING IN
EDDIES OF SPECULATION.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
MANY OF HIS STORIES HAVE A
FEELING OF INCOMPLETENESS,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
A RESULT OF AIRA'S DELIGHT
IN CONFOUNDING STANDARD

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
EXPECTATIONS OF HOW
A NOVEL SHOULD END.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
INFLUENCED BY FRENCH
WRITERS AND PHILOSOPHERS,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
HE HAS REINVIGORATED
ARGENTINEAN LITERATURE

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
WITH AN AGILE AND
LUXURIANT PROSE

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
WHICH HE PUTS IN THE
SERVICE OF PLOTS

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
THAT REVEL IN
THE UNEXPECTED.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
AIRA HAS DONE SOMETHING
REALLY POSITIVE.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
WITH HIM, THE RIGHT TO BE
LESS SERIOUS IS RECLAIMED.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
CERTAIN KINDS OF
LITERATURE OF THE 70'S

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
WERE CHARACTERIZED
BY SOLEMNITY,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
AND I THINK THAT
WAS A MISTAKE.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
IT LED TO A SENSE
OF EXCESSIVE TRUST

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
THAT ART COULD MAKE
SENSE, THAT IT COULD

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
LEAD TO COMPROMISE
AND CHANGE THE WORLD.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
AIRA HAS NOT ENJOYED
WIDESPREAD PUBLIC

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
RECOGNITION, AND
EARLY IN HIS CAREER

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
HAD TO SELF-PUBLISH
HIS WORKS.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
AN AVID FAN OF THE
ECCENTRIC, HIS LITERARY

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
CRITICISM INCLUDES
A MONOLITHIC STUDY

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
OF THE ENGLISH LIMERICK
AND NONSENSE WRITER

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
EDWARD LEAR.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
CURRENTLY HE PUBLISHES
AT A FURIOUS PACE,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
PRODUCING TWO TO FOUR
NOVELLAS A YEAR.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
HIS EDITOR SANDRA
CONTRERAS SAYS OF AIRA,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
"HE NOT ONLY
PRODUCES IN EXCESS,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
BUT HE ALSO TRANSMUTES
TIME INTO VELOCITY

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
AND VIGILANCE
INTO HASTE.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
THE QUESTION, IN THIS
SENSE, IS NOT THAT AIRA

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
PRODUCES A LOT, BUT THAT
AIRA PUBLISHES IT ALL,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
INDISCRIMINATELY:
THE GOOD NOVEL

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
AND ALSO THE
BAD ONES".

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
AMONG AIRA'S MORE POIGNANT
WORKS ARE THE TEST,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
IN WHICH THREE TEENAGERS,
TWO OF WHOM ARE LESBIANS,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
ROB A SUPERMARKET;
AND THE WEEPING,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
AN EXTENDED MONOLOGUE
THAT IS SIMULTANEOUSLY

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
HILARIOUS
AND DESPAIRING.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
I WAKE UP WITH THE FIRST
LIGHTS OF THE DAWN,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
AFTER A NIGHT OF
DEBILITATING INSOMNIA

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
AND PHANTASMAGORIA.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
I AM SO TIRED,
SO CONFUSED.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
I GIVE UP. I
CANNOT GO ON.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
ALL THE SHADED PATHS
TAKE ME TO THE ATROCIOUS

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
CERTAINTY THAT IT
HAS HAPPENED TO ME

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
WHAT I
FEARED THE MOST.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
AND THE WORST THING IS NOT
KNOWING IF IT IS CERTAIN,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
IF IT HAS PASSED OR THERE
IS SOMETHING COMING,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
ITS CAUSES,
ITS EFFECTS.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
EVERYTHING IS LOOSE,
FLOATING, UNCONNECTED.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
MANY OF AIRA'S MOST
CHARACTERISTIC PIECES,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
SUCH AS EMA THE CAPTIVE,
 THE BAPTISM, THE PHANTOMS,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
AND THE HARE REINTERPRET
THE GAUCHO TRADITION

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
GIVING IT A
POST-MODERN VIEWPOINT.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
AIRA DELIGHTS IN
DISLOCATING HISTORY

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
TO REARRANGE
IT IN A FRAMEWORK

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
OF EXTREME
SUBJECTIVITY.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
HIS TECHNIQUE
IS TO TREAT

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
THAT WHICH IS
CLOSE AT HAND

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
SO AS TO MAKE IT
ALIEN, AND VICE VERSA;

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
IN THIS WAY, EVERYTHING
BECOMES NARRATABLE.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
HE REFRAMES CONFLICTS
IN HIGH SCHOOLS IN

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
THE WAR OF
 THE GYMNASIUMS.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
HE TAKES HIS
NEIGHBORHOOD

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
- THE FLORES BARRIO
IN BUENOS AIRES -

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
AND REINTERPRETS
THE ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
LIFE OF THE STREETS
IN FLORES NIGHTS.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
HE ALSO SETS THE
OUTLANDISH ADVENTURES

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
OF THE DREAM IN
THE FLORES BARRIO.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH LITERATURE

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
IS MORE HEDONISTIC
THAN PROFESSIONAL;

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
HE EARNS HIS LIVING
AS A TRANSLATOR

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
AND SPENDS MUCH
OF HIS TIME READING.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
HE IS AS WELL RESPECTED
FOR HIS LITERARY CRITICISM

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
AS HE IS FOR HIS PROSE,
HAVING COMPOSED INCISIVE

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
MONOGRAPHS ON THE
NOVELIST ROBERTO ARLT,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
THE CARTOONIST COPI,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000
AND THE POET
ALEJANDRA PIZARNIK.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
AIRA IS A SPECIALIST
IN LITERARY REALISM.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
HE WANTS TO PUT THE LIMITS
OF REALISM TO THE TEST,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
WHAT CAN BE SHOWN AND UP
TO WHICH POINT WE DO NEED

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
COLLABORATION FROM
THE CREDULOUS READER

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
TO ACCEPT
THESE STORIES.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
WE REALLY FEEL THAT
AIRA'S NOVELS DO NOT

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
EVER ACTUALLY COME
TO COMPLETION,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
AS THEY GO
ON AND ON.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
AND THERE IS AN END,
AN ABRUPT ONE, AND THEN

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
WE SAY THAT WE HAVE
NOVELS THAT DISOBEY

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
THE CONVENTIONS OF
THE TRADITIONAL NOVEL.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
RECENTLY I TURNED
FIFTY, AND I HAD GREAT

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE
DATE, NOT AS MUCH FOR THE

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
BALANCE OF WHAT I LIVED
AS FOR THE RENOVATION,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
THE NEW BEGINNING,
THE CHANGE OF HABITS.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
IN FACT, I DID NOT
THINK FOR A MOMENT

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
ABOUT EVALUATING THE
HALF OF CENTURY LIVED.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
I HAD MY PERSPECTIVE
FIXED ON THE FUTURE.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
AIRA'S AESTHETIC
OF THE "CONTINUUM" -

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
A CONSTANT MOVEMENT FORWARD
IN FICTIONAL NARRATIVE

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
- CAN ALSO BE SEEN
IN THE WRITING STYLE

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
OF MARIO BELLATIN.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
BELLATIN PUBLISHED
HIS FIRST NOVELS -

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
SALT WOMEN, GREENHOUSE
 EFFECT, AND BEAUTY SALON

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
- WHILE LIVING IN PERU.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
HE EMIGRATED TO MEXICO
WHERE HE PRESENTLY HEADS

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
THE ESCUELA DINAMICA,
A LABORATORY FOR THE

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
DEVELOPMENT OF
PROFESSIONAL WRITERS.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
BELLATIN IS CONSIDERED
TO BE ONE OF THE MAJOR

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
SURPRISES OF CONTEMPORARY
LITERATURE, A WRITER WHO

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
HAS RETURNED THE
NOVEL TO PROMINENCE.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
HIS WORKS ARE IMBUED
WITH AN UNREAL

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
AND ALLEGORICAL
TEMPERAMENT.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
ANTHROPOLOGY SHOULD
BE FOUNDED ON

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
BELLATIN'S NOVELS.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
AS NARRATIVE MACHINES,
THEY ARE AMAZING.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
I MYSELF FEEL THAT THERE
IS NOT A GENERAL PROBLEM.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
ONE MAY SAY THAT A
PARTICULAR NOVEL OF

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
BELLATIN'S WAS A GOOD ONE,
BUT HIS OUTPUT WAS HUGE.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
LESSONS FOR A DEAD HARE
IS A NOVEL IN WHICH

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
ONE GOES DOWN AND
UP MANY LEVELS

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
AND THERE ARE STORIES
WITHIN OTHER STORIES

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
AND ONE MAY FEEL THAT
SOMETHING HAPPENED

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
BUT DOES NOT REALIZE
EXACTLY WHAT.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
BUT YOU REALIZE YOU'RE IN
A PLACE AND DO NOT REALLY

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
KNOW EXACTLY WHERE,
IN A FORMAL SENSE.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
HE IS ALSO
A WRITER CAPABLE OF

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
MASSIVE COMPREHENSIVE
NARRATIVES,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
A WRITER OF A PARTICULAR
DRYNESS DURING THE 90'S.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
BELLATIN
INTEGRATES PICTURES

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
INTO HIS NARRATIVES,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
WEAVING A COLLAGE
OF WORD AND IMAGE

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
THAT CONJURES AN
EXTREME EXPERIENCE

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
OF EVERYDAY REALITY.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
HIS PROSE IS COLD, ALMOST
OBJECTIVE, DISPELLING ANY

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
SUGGESTION OF SENTIMENT
OR DELIGHT IN CRUELTY.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
HE PICKS AT VIOLENT,
RAW, AND EXPOSED TOPICS

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
AS THOUGH THEY
WERE SCABS.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
IN THE SCHOOL OF
 HUMAN PAIN OF SICHUAN,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
BELLATIN EXPLORES
THE VARIOUS FORMS

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
OF HUMAN SUFFERING,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
OFFERING A HORRIFIC
COMPENDIUM OF MALICE.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
THE AUTHOR REFERS TO HIS
CHAPTERS AS "SMALL PLAYS",

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
AND GRANTS EACH SET
PIECE ITS AUTONOMY WHILE

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.000
SIMULTANEOUSLY INTEGRATING
IT INTO A NARRATIVE WHOLE.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
IF SOMEBODY COULD
SEE ME RIGHT NOW,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
IF SOMEONE COULD
ENJOY MY BODY

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
AS PEOPLE OF THE MOST
DIVERSE ORIGINS DO,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
THEY COULD NOT
FIGURE OUT THAT

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
I HAVE NOT RECEIVED
ANY EDUCATION.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
MORE THAN ONE WOULD THINK
THAT THE MARKS IN MY SKIN

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
OR IN MY NAILS,
SOMEWHAT BURNED,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
ARE OTHER RESOURCES
USED IN THESE LANDS

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
TO EXTEND THE
SENSATIONS OF PLEASURE

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
TO UNBEARABLE EXTREMES.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
BELLATIN'S
NOVEL FLOWERS

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
IS ALSO COMPOSED OF
NARRATIVE FRAGMENTS.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
THE AUTHOR SAYS THAT, "THE
INITIAL INTENT IS THAT

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
EACH CHAPTER MIGHT
BE READ SEPARATELY,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
AS IF IT WERE ABOUT THE
CONTEMPLATION OF A FLOWER".

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
EACH OF THE NOVEL'S
35 CHAPTERS

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
BEARS THE NAME OF
A DIFFERENT FLOWER.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
OFTENTIMES BELLATIN
REFRAINS FROM ASSIGNING

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
A SPECIFIC PLACE OR
TIMEFRAME TO HIS STORIES.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
THIS PINTERESQUE
STRATEGY LENDS A DRY,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
DISTANT TONE TO
HIS WRITING,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
WHICH SERVES AS A
CONTRASTING BACKGROUND

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
TO THE HORRIFYING
DETAILS OF HIS STORIES.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
IN HIS NOVEL, SHIKI
 NAGAOKA, A NOSE OF FICTION,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
THE PROTAGONIST
SUFFERS FROM A DISFIGURING

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
CONGENITAL DEFORMITY; IT'S
ALMOST AS IF BELLATIN

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
WERE SEEKING IN THE
MALFORMED HUMAN FIGURE

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE
PROFOUND WRONGNESS

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
WE DETECT IN
THIS WORLD.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
ANOTHER OF BELLATIN'S
NOVELS, DOG HEROES,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
HAS A SUBTITLE THAT READS:
"ESSAY ON THE FUTURE

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
OF LATIN AMERICA SEEN
THROUGH AN IMMOBILE MAN

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
AND HIS THIRTY BELGIAN
MALINOIS DOGS".

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
BELLATIN'S WORKS ALWAYS
HAVE THIS IDEA THAT

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
A DEFORMITY
IS A PROBLEM,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
WHAT COMES FROM
NOWHERE GOES NOWHERE.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
THIS IS A CONDITION,
AT THIS POINT IT HAS

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
NO SENSE, AND
IT IS FORMATIVE.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
BELLATIN'S CHARACTERS
DO NOT THINK BADLY

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
OF DEFORMITY - THEY
ALREADY HAVE IT.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
HIS NOVELS FUNCTION
ACCORDING TO

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:57.000
THIS APPROACH TO
PROCESSING EXPERIENCE.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
THE COLOMBIAN, FERNANDO
VALLEJO, IS ANOTHER

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
EXPATRIATE BASED IN
MEXICO, AND PERHAPS THE

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
MOST IMPORTANT WRITER
FROM THAT COUNTRY.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
VALLEJO BELONGS TO
THE NON-CONFORMIST

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
INTELLECTUAL
TRADITION OF ANTIOQUIA

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
- A DEPARTMENT IN THE
NORTHWEST OF COLOMBIA.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
THIS GROUP INCLUDES
WRITERS SUCH AS

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
FERNANDO GONZALEZ AND THE
NADAIST GONZALO ARANGO.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
THE NATURALNESS
OF VALLEJO'S ROUGH

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
AND VIGOROUS PROSE HAS
MUCH IN COMMON WITH

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
AUTHORS SUCH AS GENET,
HENRY MILLER,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
OR THE FRENCH
AUTHOR BORIS VIAN.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
HE TRANSFORMED HIS
INFANCY AND ADOLESCENCE

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
INTO LITERATURE IN NOVELS
SUCH AS THE BLUE DAYS,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
AND THEN THE
 SECRET FIRE.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
HE CHOOSES WORDS BOTH FOR
THEIR TRUTHFULNESS AND

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
FOR THEIR FINE EDGE AS HE
HACKS HIS WAY THROUGH THE

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
SOCIAL THICKET, EXPOSING
THE VIOLENT SIDE-EFFECTS

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
OF NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING
IN HIS COUNTRY.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
HIS NOVEL THE HENCHMEN'S
 VIRGIN WAS MADE INTO

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
A MOVIE, AND WAS
RELEASED IN THE U.S.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
AS "OUR LADY OF
THE ASSASSINS".

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
IT IS A HALLUCINATORY TALE
SET IN VALLEJO'S HOME TOWN

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
OF MEDELLIN, A CENTER
OF DRUG TRAFFICKING

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
AND RAMPANT EXCESSES
DURING THE 1990'S.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
THE BOOK TAKES THE
FORM OF A SINGLE,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
UNCHAPTERED
MONOLOGUE.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
THE NARRATOR IS A GAY
MAN WHO CLAIMS TO BE

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
A GRAMMARIAN
BY PROFESSION.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
I THINK THAT THE
 HENCHMEN'S VIRGIN

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
IS A GREAT BOOK.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
IT IS REMARKABLE BECAUSE
OF FERNANDO VALLEJO'S

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
LANGUAGE, WHICH SOMETIMES
MAKES A PACT WITH INSULT.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
IT IS A LANGUAGE OF
IRRITATION, OUTRAGE,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
DISSATISFACTION
AND GRIEF.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
I THINK THAT HE MAKES
POETRY OF AN UNPLEASANT

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
REALITY, BUT HE DOES NOT
MAKE IT ROMANTIC AT ALL.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
ALTHOUGH THE
 HENCHMEN'S VIRGIN

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
WAS A CRITICAL AND
COMMERCIAL SUCCESS,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
VALLEJO DID NOT
REST ON HIS LAURELS.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
HE CONTINUED
HITTING LOW AND HARD

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
WITH THE EDGE OF
 THE ABYSS FROM 2001,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
A NOVEL THAT TOOK AIM
AT TWO OF THE MOST

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
REVERED INSTITUTIONS
IN COLOMBIA -

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
CHURCH AND FAMILY.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
WHEN CARLOS LEFT I
APPROACHED THE BED,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
I SAT AT HIS SIDE AND
I LEANED OVER HIM:

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
HIS IMPLORING
EYES REACHED MINE.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
WHAT DID HE MEAN?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
HE WANTED ME TO
HELP HIM TO LIVE?

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
OR TO HELP
HIM TO DIE?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.000
TO LIVE, BY ALL MEANS,
HE NEVER WANTED TO DIE.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
LIKE MANY OTHER
CONTEMPORARY WRITERS,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
VALLEJO IS NOT LEERY OF
INJECTING HIS OWN LIFE

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
INTO THE
STORIES HE TELLS.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
THE RIVER OF TIME, BILLED
AS AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
IS A COLLECTION
OF SHORT PIECES THAT

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
BLURS THE LINE BETWEEN
PERSONAL HISTORY AND NOVEL,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
BLENDING MEMOIRS
AND REFLECTIONS,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
THE PAST AND THE PRESENT,
REALITY AND HALLUCINATION.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
AND IN MY
 BROTHER THE MAYOR,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
VALLEJO TURNS TO ANOTHER
MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
HIS BROTHER CARLOS, WHO
SERVED FOR THREE YEARS

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
AS MAYOR OF TAMESIS, A
REMOTE MOUNTAIN TOWN.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
IN MY BROTHER
 THE MAYOR

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
VALLEJO DETAILS THE
ABSURDITY INHERENT

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
IN THE TRADITIONAL
MECHANISMS OF POWER.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
HIS ACID PROSE OFFERS
A FEROCIOUS SATIRE

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
OF THE HUMAN DESIRE FOR
ORDERLINESS AND COHESION.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
SAYS CRITIC
JUAN VILLORO:

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
"HIS IMPRECATORY HARANGUES
FALL ON COLOMBIA

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
LIKE ACID RAIN, A
VIOLENT TEMPEST,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
A CATACLYSM OF
THE LANGUAGE".

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
IN ARGENTINA, THE
ECONOMIC CRISIS OF 2001

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
DEVASTATED THE
MIDDLE CLASS.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
AS A RESULT, A NEW
CATEGORY OF CLASSLESS

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
AND EXCLUDED
PEOPLE WAS FORMED.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
WITH THIS SOCIAL
PHENOMENON THERE AROSE

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
A GENERALIZED SENSE
OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
AND CULTURAL IMPOTENCE.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
DRUG ADDICTION
BECAME WIDESPREAD,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
STANDARD SOCIAL
MODELS DISSOLVED,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
AND THERE AROSE A
DESPERATE NEED

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
FOR AN ALTERNATIVE
AND INDEPENDENT

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
MEANS OF EXPRESSION.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
THUS WAS BORN
CHABON LITERATURE,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
A NEW SPECIES
OF FICTION THAT

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
GIVES VOICE TO THE
RECENTLY DISENFRANCHISED.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE
STREET, "CHABON" IS A

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
SLANG TERM THAT GUYS USE
TO REFER TO EACH OTHER.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
AN EXAMPLE OF THIS SPECIES
OF WRITER IS THE POET

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
AND PUBLISHER SANTIAGO
VEGA, WHO WRITES

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
UNDER THE PSEUDONYM
WASHINGTON CUCURTO.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
CUCURTO IS THE AUTHOR
OF COSA DE NEGROS,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
A NOVEL WHOSE
MARGINALIZED CHARACTERS

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
OF DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS
INVESTIGATE ISSUES

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
OF RACE AND RENEW
THE DISCUSSION ABOUT

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN
HIGH AND LOW CULTURE.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
THE LATE 20TH CENTURY
MOVEMENT TOWARDS REALISM

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
HAS BEEN MARKED BY A
RETURN TO THE USE OF

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
THE FIRST PERSON.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
IN CONTEMPORARY LATIN
AMERICAN LITERATURE

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
THE FIRST PERSON
CAN BE ALTERNATINGLY

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
- AND SOMETIMES
SIMULTANEOUSLY -

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
CONFESSIONAL AND
IMPETUOUS IN TONE.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
THE "I" OF THE NARRATIVE
STANDS OUTSIDE THE ACTION,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
FREE TO SUBJECTIVIZE
AN INCREASINGLY COMPLEX

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
AND INTERCONNECTED WORLD.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
AS A RESULT, OBSERVED
REALITY BECOMES SUFFUSED

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
WITH AN INTENSELY
PERSONAL VISION -

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000
THAT OF THE AUTHOR,
BY MEANS OF LANGUAGE

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
THAT CROSSES OVER GENRES
AND INVOKES IMAGES

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
CO-OPTED FROM A
MEDIA-SATURATED CULTURE.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
THE INFLUENCE OF WRITERS
SUCH AS MANUEL PUIG,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
SEVERO SARDUY,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
ALFREDO
BRYCE ECHENIQUE,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
AND CABRERA INFANTE HAS
PROVIDED LATIN AMERICAN

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
LITERATURE WITH A WISE
HUMOR, ONE THAT TRANSFORMS

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
STANDARD DOMESTIC DIALOGUE
INTO A KIND OF CINEMA.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
ONE CAN SEE THESE
INFLUENCES IN

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
PEDRO LEMEBEL
IN CHILE,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
MARGO GLANTZ
IN MEXICO,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
LAURA RESTREPO
IN COLOMBIA,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
MAROSA DI GIORGIO
IN URUGUAY,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
OR ALAN PAULS
IN ARGENTINA.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
IN THE 1990'S, TWO
IMPORTANT LATIN AMERICAN

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
LITERARY TRENDS
CONVERGED:

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
THE CRACK GENERATION
AND MCONDO.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
THE CRACK GENERATION WAS
A MOVEMENT THAT BEGAN

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
IN MEXICO, FUELED BY
WRITERS SEEKING TO

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
LIBERATE THEMSELVES
FROM THE OBLIGATION TO

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
REPORT ON THEIR MESTIZO
OR REVOLUTIONARY PAST.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
THEY NO LONGER WANTED
TO WRITE ABOUT

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
TOWNS INHABITED BY GHOSTS,
TO WRITE EXOTIC TALES

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
ABOUT THE CACIQUES
OR HEADMEN,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
ABOUT WORK IN
GRIM FACTORIES

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
OR WHETHER OR NOT TO
SLIP ACROSS THE BORDER.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
THE TERM "CRACK
GENERATION", THEN,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
REFERS NOT TO THE
COCAINE-BASED DRUG

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
BUT RATHER TO THE
PROCESS OF RUPTURE,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
OF MAKING A CLEAN
BREAK FROM THE PAST.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
THESE ARE YOUNG WRITERS
WHO WERE TRYING TO

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
SWEEP CLEAN THE
FOUNDATIONS

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
OF THE MEXICAN
LITERARY SCENE.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
THEIR QUEST BEGAN
IN THE SUMMER OF 1996,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
WHEN A MINOR LITERARY
JOURNAL PUBLISHED

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000
A MANIFESTO SIGNED BY
FIVE YOUNG WRITERS:

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
IGNACIO PADILLA,
JORGE VOLPI, ELOY URROZ

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
AND RICARDO
CHAVEZ CASTANEDA.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
THE MANIFESTO WAS A PLEA
TO LEAVE WHAT THEY CALLED

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
"BANANA" LITERATURE
BEHIND, AND TO RETURN

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
TO THE ROOTS OF THE
LATIN AMERICAN BOOM:

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
AN INTIMATE BOND WITH
AN INTELLIGENT READER.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
BY 2001, THE MEMBERS
OF THE CRACK GENERATION

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
HAD ACHIEVED INTERNATIONAL
RECOGNITION.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
THEIR BOOKS WERE
COMMERCIAL SUCCESSES,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
AND THEIR WRITING APPEARED
IN SUCH MAINSTREAM VENUES

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
AS EL PAIS, EL UNIVERSAL,
AND EL HERALD.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
"CRACK" REFERS TO
A GROUP OF NOVELS

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
AND NOT OF
INDIVIDUALS,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
NOVELS WHICH WERE
PRESENTED WITH

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
THEIR OWN MANIFESTO OR
ANTI-MANIFESTO IN 1996.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
TEN YEARS AGO IT WAS
FORMED BY FIVE NOVELS

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:07.000
FROM FIVE WRITERS:
JORGE VOLPI, ELOY URROZ,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
PEDRO ANGEL PALOU,
VICENTE HERRASTI,

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
RICARDO
CHAVEZ CASTANEDA

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
AND ME:
IGNACIO PADILLA.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
THESE NOVELS WERE
PRESENTED BY A GROUP

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
OF WRITERS WHO
HAD MANY INTERESTS

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
BUT WHO ALSO WANTED
TO MAKE A JOKE.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
IN THE CRACK MANIFESTO
THEY HAD CALLED FOR THE

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
RESURRECTION OF WHAT THE
CRITIC JOHN BRUSHWOOD

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
HAD TERMED THE
"PROFOUND NOVEL" -

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
BOOKS THAT MADE DEMANDS
UPON THE READER,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
AND REQUIRED THEIR
ACTIVE PARTICIPATION.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
THEY CITED
NOVELS SUCH AS

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
THE MUNDANE DAYS
BY JOSE REVUELTAS,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
FARABEUF BY
SALVADOR ELIZONDO,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
OR THE DEATH OF ARTEMIO
 CRUZ BY CARLOS FUENTES.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
THE MANIFESTO
MAKES CLEAR

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
THE CRACK WRITER'S
RESPONSIBILITY:

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
TO CARE FOR THE
 INTELLIGENT READER

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
AND TO BREAK THE
 TENDENCY OF THE

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
PUBLISHING MARKET TO
 ENCUMBER LITERATURE

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
WITH DECEIT, TRICKS,
 AND INGENUES,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
THE CYNICALLY SUPERFICIAL
 AND DISHONEST NOVEL.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
FOR THE CRACK
 NOVEL, THUS,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
THE LANGUAGE MUST BE
 RENEWED WITHIN ITSELF

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
- THAT IS, FEEDING IT
 ITS MOST ANCIENT ASHES.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
THE FIRST
OFFERINGS FROM THE

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
CRACK MOVEMENT WERE
TITLES SUCH AS

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
MELANCHOLY TEMPERAMENT
BY JORGE VOLPI,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
IF YOUR MAJESTIES WERE TO
 RETURN BY IGNACIO PADILLA,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
THE IDIOT CONSPIRACY
BY RICARDO CHAVEZ,

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
AND LAS REMORAS
BY ELOY URROZ.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
THESE NOVELS HAD LITTLE
IMPACT OUTSIDE OF MEXICO.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
HOWEVER, IN 1999,
JORGE VOLPI WON THE

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
PRESTIGIOUS SPANISH
LITERARY PRIZE,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
THE PREMIO BIBLIOTECA
BREVE DE SEIX BARRAL,

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
FOR HIS WORK ENTITLED
 IN SEARCH OF KLINGSOR.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
THE NOVEL COMMINGLES
METAPHYSICS WITH

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
REFLECTIONS ON THE ETHICS
OF SCIENCE AND POWER.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
THE STORY FOLLOWS AN
AMERICAN PHYSICIST

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000
AND A GERMAN MATHEMATICIAN
WHO ARE ON A QUEST

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
TO UNCOVER INFORMATION
ABOUT KLINGSOR,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
A NAZI OFFICER WHO
ORDERED JEWS TO BE KILLED

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
IN THE NAME
OF SCIENCE.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
ENOUGH LIGHT!

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
HIS ACID AND AGED WORDS
 MAKE THE WORLD COME BACK,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
FOR A MOMENT, TO THE
 COLD AGE OF DARKNESS.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
THE SPACE THAT SURROUNDS
 HIM IS LIKE A DROP OF

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
CHINESE INK WHERE SHADOW
 IS ACCENTUATED BY SILENCE:

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
FOR AN INSTANT,
 NOBODY APPLAUDS HIM,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
NOBODY DECEIVES HIM,
 NOBODY INSULTS HIM.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
EVEN THE CLOCKS,
 OBEDIENT, SHUT UP.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
DEATH, HE IS
 SURE OF IT,

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
IS NOT GOING TO
 BE VERY DIFFERENT.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
ONLY WHEN THE ECHO OF
 HIS OWN VOICE DISPERSES,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
HE REALIZES HE IS THE
 INHABITANT OF A COSMOS

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
THAT NO LONGER
 BELONGS TO HIM.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
COMPARED TO THE
CRACK MOVEMENT,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
THE MCONDO WRITERS
ARE MORE DISPERSED,

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
MORE PROLIFIC,
AND LESS DOGMATIC.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
MCONDO ARTISTS CAN BE
FOUND IN LITERATURE,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
MUSIC AND FILM, FEEDING
ON WHAT THEY CALL

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
"BASTARD CULTURE",

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
WHERE HYBRIDISM IS A
SOURCE OF RICHNESS.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
THE NAME "MCONDO"
IS A PLAY ON WORDS:

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
IT MOCKS MAGICAL
REALISM BY WAY OF

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
GABRIEL GARCIA
MARQUEZ'S FAMOUS

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
IMAGINARY VILLAGE
NAMED MACONDO.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
ALBERTO FUGUET, THE WRITER
WHO COINED THE TERM,

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
EXPLAINED THAT:
"MY OWN WORLD IS

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
SOMETHING MUCH CLOSER TO
WHAT I CALL 'MCONDO' -

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
A WORLD OF MCDONALD'S,
MACINTOSHES AND CONDOS".

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
THE OVERARCHING INTENT
OF MCONDO AUTHORS IS

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
NOTHING LESS THAN TO
ANSWER THE GREAT QUESTION

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
OF LATIN AMERICAN
LITERATURE - "WHO ARE WE?"

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
- THOUGH THE LENS OF
PERSONAL IDENTITY -

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
"WHO AM I?"

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE
INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
CRACK MANIFESTO PRESENTED
IN 1996 CAME OUT AT

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
EXACTLY THE SAME TIME AS
THE MCONDO ANTHOLOGY,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
A SERIES OF LATIN AMERICAN
WRITERS, ALSO MEXICAN,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
WHO HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE CRACK MEMBERS.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
THESE WRITERS ALSO
PLEADED FOR AN END

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
TO THE MYTH OF
MAGICAL REALISM,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
FOR A RETURN TO THE GREAT
LITERATURE OF THE BOOM,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
A RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL
BORGES AND TO THE WHOLE

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
LATIN AMERICAN
TRADITION OF CERVANTES.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000
CLEARLY, HOWEVER, THE
PERSONAL VISIONS OF MCONDO

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
ARE MANIFESTED IN WILDLY
DISSIMILAR STYLES.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
ALBERTO FUGUET
IS FASCINATED BY

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
CROSS REFERENCES BETWEEN
THE POPULAR CULTURES

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
OF THE UNITED STATES
AND CHILE, HIS HOME.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
A DIRECTOR OF FEATURE
FILMS AS WELL AS A WRITER,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000

"EARTHQUAKE!",
AND "LOGAN'S RUN".

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
HIS CINEMATIC MEMOIRS
SERVE AS A MEDIUM

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
FOR RETELLING
THE HISTORY OF

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
HIS HIGHLY
DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
I AM IN THE SAND,
KNOCKED DOWN,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
CRACKS, GLUED
BY THE HUMIDITY,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
WITHOUT STRENGTH TO
THROW ME TO THE SEA

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
AND TO FLOAT FOR A WHILE
UNTIL DISAPPEARING.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
I AM BORED, FED UP: EVEN
THINKING EXHAUSTS ME.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
FOR THE LAST HOUR, MY
ONLY DISTRACTION HAS BEEN

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
TO FEEL THE RAYS OF THE
SUN DRILLING MY EYELIDS,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000
VOODOO NEEDLES THAT
SOME "EX" PINS ME WITH

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
FROM HAITI OR JAMAICA,
THAT'S WHAT A WHORE SHE IS.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
THE ARGENTINEAN
AUTHOR RODRIGO FRESAN

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
DEMONSTRATES A WIDE RANGE
OF INFLUENCES IN HIS NOVELS

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
THE LIVES OF SAINTS
AND THE SPEED OF THINGS.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
HIS NOVELS HAVE BEEN
DESCRIBED AS REMINISCENT

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
OF THE BRILLIANT
EXPERIMENTAL NOVELIST

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
JULIO CORTAZAR,
F. SCOTT FITZGERALD,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
JOHN CHEEVER, AND
KURT VONNEGUT.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
MCONDO IS AN ANTHOLOGY,
IT WAS MAINLY THAT.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
WITHIN THAT ANTHOLOGY,
I THINK MCONDO WAS THE

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
PROLOGUE OF THE
ANTHOLOGY WRITTEN BY

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
ALBERTO FUGUET AND
BY SERGIO GOMEZ,

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
MORE THAN THE SHORT
STORIES THEMSELVES.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
THE BOLIVIAN
EDMUNDO PAZ SOLDAN

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
FOLLOWS A
DIFFERENT PATH,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
MORE ANALOGOUS
TO THE WORK OF

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
JORGE LUIS BORGES,
WILLIAM FAULKNER,

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000

HIS SOCIAL NOVELS
CONFOUND EXPECTATIONS,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
AND ARE SET
AGAINST A BACKDROP

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
OF ANTI-GLOBALIZATION
PROTESTS.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
HIS WORKS INHABIT A
TERRITORY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
THRILLERS AND ASTUTE
SOCIOLOGICAL NARRATIVES.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000
IN HIS NOVEL DIGITAL
 DREAMS, HE INCORPORATES

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
THE SOCIAL IMPACT
OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
INTO HIS FICTION.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
AND, IN BOOKS LIKE
 THE MATTER OF DESIRE,

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
IMPERFECT LOVES, AND
IN THE TALES FROM THE

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
COLLECTION ENTITLED
 SIMULACRA, HE EXPLORES

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
THE LANGUAGE OF INTIMACY
IN ARCH SOCIAL DYNAMICS.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
THE MATTER OF DESIRE TELLS
THE STORY OF AN AFFAIR

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
BETWEEN A LATIN AMERICAN
POLITICAL-SCIENCE

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000
PROFESSOR AND ONE OF
HIS GRADUATE STUDENTS.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
IT EXPLORES THEMES OF
DISLOCATION AND YEARNING -

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
FOR INTIMACY BUT ALSO FOR
HOME, A PLACE THAT WILL

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000
NEVER BE THE SAME ONCE
IT HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
WITH THE DAWN OF
A NEW CENTURY,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
WOMEN WRITERS
HAVE EXPLODED ONTO

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
THE LATIN AMERICAN
LITERARY SCENE.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
SOME AUTHORS INTERWEAVE
POLITICAL EVENTS

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
WITH EXPERIMENTAL
NARRATIVES AND FORMS.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
OTHERS EXPLORE
THE EXPERIENCE

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
OF THE PRESENT IN
THEIR WRITINGS,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
EXPLORING THE PHYSICAL
ROLE OF THE BODY

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
IN FULLY REALIZED
FEMALE CHARACTERS.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
DESPITE THE MANY STYLISTIC
DIFFERENCES AMONG THEM,

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
THE INFLUENCE OF SEMINAL
WRITERS SUCH AS THE

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000
MAGICAL REALIST LUISA
VALENZUELA IS UNDENIABLE.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
SHE IS THE AUTHOR
OF ESSAYS SUCH AS

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
DARK DESIRES
 AND THE OTHERS,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
AND HIGHLY PRAISED STORIES
LIKE CHANGE OF ARMS

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000
AND AS IN WAR, A WORK
IN WHICH VICTIMS AND

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
EXECUTIONERS ARE
INEXTRICABLY INTERCONNECTED,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000
WITHOUT KNOWING
WHERE THE FAULT,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
HATRED, OR
DESIRE BEGINS.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
HERE YOU HAVE A STORY

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
THAT DOES NOT GET
TO MAKE HISTORY;

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
SOMEBODY WHO DOES
NOT EVEN GET A FACE,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
BECAUSE, WHAT CAN ONE
KNOW OF HER OWN FACE?

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
A FLEETING GLANCE BEFORE
THE MIRROR, TO WATCH AND

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
UN-RECOGNIZE YOURSELF, TO
TRY TO SAIL ALL WATERS IN

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
SEARCH OF THE SAME THING
THAT ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:16.000
MEAN TO FIND YOURSELF
IN THE REFLECTIONS.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
DIAMELA ELTIT OF
CHILE UTILIZES DENSE,

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
WORKED-OUT PROSE THAT IS
AS POETIC AS IT IS OMINOUS

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
TO NARRATE THE EXPERIENCE
OF THE MARGINALIZED,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
DOWNTRODDEN, AND
OUT-AND-OUT UNLUCKY.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
SHE EXAMINES THE
STRUCTURES OF OPPRESSION,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
THE BARRIERS
TO INTIMACY,

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
AND THE ABUSES OF POWER
THAT AFFLICT WOMEN.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
IN HER NOVELS MANUAL LABOR
AND THE FOURTH WORLD,

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000
PAIN AND LUST
APPEAR INSEPARABLE.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
THE COLOMBIAN WRITER LAURA
RESTREPO HAS MANAGED TO

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
ACHIEVE GREAT POPULARITY
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
KEEPING HER
SINGULAR SLANT.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000
ACTIVE IN LEFTIST POLITICS
FROM AN EARLY AGE,

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
HER EXPERIENCE ACTING
AS MEDIATOR BETWEEN THE

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
GUERRILLA GROUP M-19 AND
THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
SERVED AS A SPRINGBOARD
FOR HER LITERARY CAREER.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
HER FIRST BOOK,
 STORY OF A FASCINATION,

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
GIVES AN ACCOUNT
OF THE FAILURE OF

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
THESE TWO GROUPS
TO COME TO TERMS,

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
AND LED TO HER SELF-IMPOSED
EXILE IN SPAIN AND MEXICO.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
SHE RECEIVED
THE PRESTIGIOUS

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
ALFAGUARA AWARD IN 2004
FOR HER NOVEL DELIRIUM.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
THE MEXICAN
AUTHOR MARGO GLANTZ

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
HAS HAD A LONG CAREER AS
A DISTINGUISHED NOVELIST,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
CRITIC, JOURNALIST
AND TRANSLATOR.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
THE CHILD OF AN IMMIGRANT
FAMILY FROM THE UKRAINE,

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
HER RICH,
NUANCED EVOCATION

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
OF STATES OF
MIND AND EMOTION

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
HAS CAUSED HER
TO BE REGARDED AS

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
ONE OF MEXICO'S LEADING
LITERARY FIGURES.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
HER METICULOUS STORIES
SEEK THE CAUSE

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
OF DISCONTENT
IN SMALL DETAILS,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000
AND UNCOVER THE
HUMOR THAT LIES

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
AT THE HEART OF
THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000
WORDS FOR A FABLE:
"HOW TO DEFINE WITH WORDS

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
FEELINGS AND
THE AFFECTIONS?

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
THAT IS
VERY DIFFICULT,

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
IT SEEMS TO ME
BEYOND ALL DOUBT.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
ALSO, DOESN'T
THE POET SAY THAT

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
WORDS SCREAM
LIKE WHORES?

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
AND WHEN THEY SCREAM
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
MAKE THEM SAY WHAT
ONE MEANS AND I,

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY,
DO NOT GET TO THINK

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
ABOUT COMMON OR SIMPLY
HUMBLE THINGS AND

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000
I ALWAYS TRY TO FEEL FUCKING
GOOD AND NOT TO SCREAM,

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
BUT AT THE MOMENT IN
WHICH I WRITE THESE WORDS

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
MY COMPUTER GIVES
THE REASON TO HIM,

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000
TO THE POET,
BECAUSE SHE BLUSHES

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
AND UNDERLINES IN
RED THE BAD WORDS -

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
THOSE WHORES THAT ARE
ALWAYS SCREAMING".

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
AS LATIN AMERICAN
LITERATURE BLAZES A PATH

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
INTO THE 21ST CENTURY,
IT CONTINUES A COMPLEX

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
INTERACTION WITH HISTORY
THAT HAS BEEN ONGOING

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
SINCE BEFORE THE
TIME OF THE CONQUEST.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
THE RECENT PAST
UNDOUBTEDLY WEIGHS HEAVY

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
ON THE MINDS OF
YOUNG WRITERS -

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
THE HUGE COMMERCIAL
IMPACT OF THE BOOM

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
AND THE AESTHETIC TRIUMPH
OF MAGICAL REALISM,

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000
THE TOWERING FIGURE
OF JORGE LUIS BORGES,

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
THE EROTICISM
OF PABLO NERUDA,

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
WORKS SUCH AS ROBERTO ARLT'S
BRILLIANT THE ANGRY TOY,

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
JULIO CORTAZAR'S DAZZLING
EXPERIMENTAL NOVEL HOPSCOTCH,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000
AND ONE HUNDRED
 YEARS OF SOLITUDE

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
BY GABRIEL
GARCIA MARQUEZ.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000
YET CONTEMPORARY WRITERS
SUCH AS WASHINGTON CUCURTO

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000
AND EDMUNDO PAZ SOLDAN
WILL CONTINUE TO REINVENT

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
LITERATURE WHILE WRITING
IN A TRADITION THAT

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000
REACHES BACK TO THE
POPOL VUH OF THE QUICHES

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
AND THE BOOKS OF
THE CHILAM BALAM.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
THE WRITERS BEING BORN
TODAY IN QUITO, IN CUBA,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
OR IN BUENOS AIRES WILL
WRITE IN A TRADITION THAT

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
INCLUDES FRAY BERNARDINO
DE SAHAGUN AND HIS

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
GENERAL HISTORY OF THE
 THINGS OF NEW SPAIN

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
AND ESTEBAN ECHEVERRIA'S
SHORT STORY

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000
THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000
IN THIS DIALOGUE BETWEEN
THE FUTURE AND THE PAST

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
YOU CAN HEAR THE DISTINCT
STRAINS OF GAUCHO POETRY

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000
SUCH AS MARTIN FIERRO, THE
EPIC POEM BY JOSE HERNANDEZ;

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
OR THE EVERYDAY RHYTHMS
OF COSTUMBRISMO,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
A GENRE THAT
CAPTURED THE NUANCES

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
OF EVERYDAY
MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
THE LITERATURE OF TODAY
PROCEEDS IN A DELICATE

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
DANCE WITH THE MODERNISMO
OF RUBEN DARIO

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
AND HIS SEMINAL
BOOK OF POEMS, AZUL,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
AND WITH SHORT PROSE
PIECES THAT DWELL IN THE

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:36.000
REALM OF THE DAY-TO-DAY,
KNOWN AS CRONICAS.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000
THIS DYNAMIC IS INFORMED
BY MOVEMENTS LIKE

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000
REGIONALISM,
INDIGENIST NARRATIVES,

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
AND THE "NOVELAS
DE LA TIERRA".

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
IT IS A TRADITION SHAPED
BY THE ZEST OF THE

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
REVOLUTIONARY NOVEL
AND THE VALOR OF THE

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
HISTORICAL NOVEL, SUCH
AS NATANIEL AGUIRRE'S

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
MASTERPIECE
 JUAN DE LA ROSA:

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
MEMOIRS OF THE LAST SOLDIER
 OF THE INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000
AND, IT IS A LITERATURE
WRITTEN IN AN IDIOM

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
DEFINED BY THE
BRILLIANT POLEMICS OF

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
DOMINGO FAUSTINO SARMIENTO,
BY THE INFUSION OF

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
QUECHUA LANGUAGE AND
SYNTAX FROM THE WORKS OF

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
JOSE MARIA ARGUEDAS,
AND BY THE INFLECTIONS

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
OF "POESIA NEGRA",

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
WHICH SYNTHESIZED
BLACK AND WHITE CULTURE

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
TO DESCRIBE THE
JOYS AND THE AGONY

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
OF THE AFRICAN
EXPERIENCE IN AMERICA.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE
WRITING ONE'S MIND

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000
HAS LED TO
PERSECUTION, EXILE,

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000
AND EVEN ASSASSINATION,
THE STAKES FOR

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000
CONTEMPORARY WRITERS FROM
LATIN AMERICA ARE HIGH,

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
JUST AS THEY WERE FOR
THEIR PREDECESSORS.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
WHILE IT'S TOO EARLY
TO PREDICT THE FUTURE,

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000
THE PRESENT CULTURAL
COORDINATES POINT TO

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000
AN ONGOING FASCINATION
WITH IDENTITY, EVEN AS

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
LATIN AMERICA GRAPPLES
WITH GLOBALIZATION,

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.000
AND WITH NEW FORMS
OF SUBJECTIVITY

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000
AND MIXED NARRATIVE
TECHNIQUES THAT CONTINUE

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.000
TO STRETCH THE BOUNDARIES
OF WORLD LITERATURE.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:33.000
