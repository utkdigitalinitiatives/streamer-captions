WEBVTT

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Woman: WHAT, HONEY?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Narrator:
 BROTHERS AND SISTERS...

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Woman: DID YOU DROP
 ALL THAT YOGURT?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Narrator:
 SOMETIMES THEY'RE PERFECT.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Girl: SHE'S NOT PERFECT,
 AND SHE WANTS TO BE PERFECT.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Woman:
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Narrator:
 SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
( crying )

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Narrator:
 TODAY, A NEW LOOK INSIDE
 THE WORLD OF SIBLINGS.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
AND NEW FINDINGS
 ABOUT HOW BIRTH ORDER

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
AFFECTS YOUR CHILD'S
 PERSONALITY.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
WE OFTEN SEE
SECOND-BORNS WHO ARE
EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
AND SUCCESSFUL,
'CAUSE THEY'VE FOUND
A ROLE FOR THEMSELVES.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Narrator:
 BRAZELTON ON PARENTING.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
( theme music playing )

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
HAVING A CHILD IS ONE
OF THE MOST WONDERFUL THINGS

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
A MAN OR WOMAN
CAN EXPERIENCE.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
HAVING MORE THAN ONE
IS GREAT TOO,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
BUT BELIEVE ME,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT
ADVENTURE IN PARENTING.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS
I'M MOST OFTEN ASKED BY PARENTS

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
IS HOW THEY CAN HELP THEIR
CHILDREN TO GET ALONG BETTER.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
THE SHORT ANSWER IS,
BY SIMPLY STAYING OUT OF IT.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
THE LONGER ONE INVOLVES
A DEEPER LOOK

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
INTO THE COMPLEX DYNAMICS
OF PARENTS AND SIBLINGS.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Woman: RACHEL AND ERIKA
 ARE ONLY A YEAR APART,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
SO IT WAS VERY
CHALLENGING THEN,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
BUT I THINK WHEN
HANNAH CAME ALONG,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
SHE WAS A LITTLE MORE WORK,
 BUT NOT QUITE AS MUCH WORK

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
AND IT WAS...

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST NON-STOP.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Man: THE EXPECTATIONS FOR

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
HAVING THE THIRD WAS LIKE,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
"OH MY GOD,
 WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
WITH THREE CHILDREN?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
WE'RE NEVER GONNA
BE ABLE TO GET OUT.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
ARE WE'RE CRAZY TAKING THIS ON
 AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE?"

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
BUT, YOU KNOW,
 IT'S ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
BETTER, ACTUALLY,
 WITH HANNAH.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
BUT IT'S NOTHING WE
HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
IT'S JUST,
"OH NO, AGAIN."

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
IT WAS EXTREMELY
OVERWHELMING, I THINK.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
EXTREMELY OVERWHELMING
TO KNOW THAT WE'D HAVE FIVE
CHILDREN FIVE AND UNDER.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
BABY.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
AND HOW WE WOULD MANAGE
THAT AND THE HOUSEHOLD
AND THE RESPONSIBILITY.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
WHAT ARE WE HAVING HERE?
BOYS OR GIRLS?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
GIRLS.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
- NO, BOYS!
- YOU THINK THEY'RE BOYS?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Woman: YES, IT WAS OVERWHELMING,
 BUT THE SHOCK IS OVER

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
AND WE'VE GRABBED IT BY
 THE HORNS, AND WE ARE READY.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
- GIRLS!
- THEY'RE GIRLS.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I ALWAYS WANTED, SAY,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
DREAMED OF HAVING
FOUR AND FIVE CHILDREN.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ONE CHILD
BECAUSE RACHEL WAS--

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I GOT PREGNANT WHEN SHE WAS
ONLY THREE MONTHS OLD.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
SHE DIDN'T HAVE THAT WHOLE
 LITTLE LIFE OF HER OWN
 FOR A WHILE, YOU KNOW,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
AND THEN IT JUST BECAME
THE TWO OF THEM.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
 BESIDES LIFE WITH ERIKA.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
THAT HAS REALLY FOSTERED
THEIR RELATIONSHIP A LOT.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
BEFORE HANNAH, THEY DIDN'T
 REALLY SEE THE DISTINCTION

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
OF THE OLDER ONE
 AND THE YOUNGER ONE.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
JUST LIKE, "WE'RE THE KIDS
AND THEY'RE THE PARENTS."

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
AND WHEN HANNAH CAME,
IT REALLY DEFINED THE FAMILY.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
SHE WAS THE BABY AND THEY ALL
 KIND OF SAW THEIR LITTLE PLACE.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
OH, LOOK WHAT
ERIKA BROUGHT YOU.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Woman: NOLAN, UM,
 THE BOYS LOVED RIGHT AWAY.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Man: WELL, JOEY KNEW MORE
 OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
AND HE WAS THERE
 TO SUPPORT AND HELP HER

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
PLAY THE ROLE OF
THE BIG BROTHER,
AND NOL--

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
EVAN WAS I THINK
THE ONE THAT WAS--
POOR THING.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
WAS MORE LIKE,
"WHEN'S THE CHANCE?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
WHEN MOMMY'S NOT LOOKING,
I'M GONNA STEAL HIS BLANKET."

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Woman: AND THEY CERTAINLY TOOK
 ADVANTAGE OF EVERY MOMENT THAT
 WHEN WE WERE WITH THE BABY,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
TO EITHER DESTROY THE HOUSE
OR TO HURT EACH OTHER

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
OR FIGHT
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
RACHEL IS VERY OUTGOING.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
SHE JUST GOES FULL FORCE
INTO EVERYTHING.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Woman: TWO DIFFERENT TEACHERS
 HAVE SAID THAT SHE'S LIKE

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
GONNA A WOMAN OF THE NINETIES
 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS
SO FUNNY AT FOUR YEARS OLD,
BUT SHE GIVES THAT IMPRESSION.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
WHERE ERIKA,
AS THE MIDDLE CHILD,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
SHE'S EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT
 AND SHE THINKS.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
MY DAUGHTER, SHE'S GONNA BE
 ONE OF THOSE STUDENTS

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
THAT MAY SIT IN CLASS,
 ALWAYS KNOW THE ANSWER,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
BUT MAY NEVER RAISE HER HAND
 AND GIVE IT OUT.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
HER HUMOR IS, UH,
 IT'S MORE OFF THE CUFF,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
AND HANNAH'S JUST RIGHT NOW
IN HER OWN WHATEVER--

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
A BUG FLYING BY JUST
CRACKS HER UP, OR WHATEVER.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
SO, I MEAN, THAT'S JUST
THE CUTENESS OF BEING
A TWO-YEAR-OLD.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A HIGH TOLERANCE LEVEL

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
WHEN YOU HAVE
 THREE YOUNG BOYS.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
RIGHT HERE?
WHAT DID EVAN DO?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
HE HIT ME IN THE HEAD
WITH THE BAT.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
- EVAN, WHAT DO YOU
  SAY TO JOEY?
- SORRY.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
THEN YOU HAVE TO
GIVE 'EM SOME SPACE
TO FEEL OUT AND--

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Woman: WORK IT OUT
 AMONGST EACH OTHER
 IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Man: WE DON'T WANT TO INTERVENE
50 OUT OF 60 MINUTES AN HOUR,
IF THAT WERE THE CASE.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I ALMOST HAVE IT FIGURED OUT
THAT'S IT LIKE ONCE AN HOUR,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING ERUPTS.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
AND I'D ALWAYS BE
 RIGHT THERE LIKE,
 "OKAY, OKAY, LET'S STOP."

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I THINK ONCE HANNAH CAME ALONG,
 I PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE
 THE TIME TO DO THAT,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
AND SO THEY HAVE LEARNED TO
WORK THINGS OUT ON THEIR OWN.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
AND NOW I'LL EVEN
SAY TO THEM,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
IF ONE OF THEM COMES
 RUNNING TO ME WITH,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
"SHE DID THIS,
 SHE DID THAT," AND, UM--

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
MY RESPONSE NOW,
INSTEAD OF YELLING,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
IS TO JUST SAY,
"LET'S TRY TO WORK IT OUT."

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
LOOK OUT!
AAH!

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Man:
 HEY, HEY, HEY.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Woman:
 DISCIPLINING THE CHILDREN.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
SHE'S PROBABLY MORE VERBAL.
PROBABLY? SHE IS.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Woman: I DO NOT WANT YOU
DOING THAT, PLEASE.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
- Man: I'M MORE, UM--
- Woman: PATIENT.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I SAW YOU GO BANGIN'
INTO THE DOOR.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I'LL SAY, "THIS IS
UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR."

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I'LL EXPLAIN
VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD
WHY IT'S UNACCEPTABLE,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
AND THEN TELL THEM
WHAT I EXPECT THEM TO DO.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
...BANGING THE DOOR,
I TOLD YOU TO STOP, RIGHT?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
- OKAY.
- LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.
  LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I'LL SAY,
"DO YOU UNDERSTAND?"

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
AND HE'LL TURN HIS HEAD
AND SAY, "HUH."

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
AND I'LL GRAB HIM AND SAY,
"LOOK ME IN THE EYE."

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
COVER YOUR MOUTH.
GOOD BOY.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
- YEAH.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
WHEN I GET THE YES, I SAY,
"GOOD, IT'S A DEAL."

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
GIVE ME FIVE.
OKAY.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Man: YEAH!
 ALL RIGHT.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
THROW THOSE
 COOKIES.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I SPEND A LOT OF
ONE-ON-ONE WITH HANNAH

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
BECAUSE THE OTHER TWO
ARE THEIR OWN PLAYMATES.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
- ( Hannah mutters )
- YOU CAN GIVE THEM TO ME.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
HOW MANY
ARE THERE?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
- ONE.
- TWO.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
DID YOU PUT A ROCK
IN MY POCKET?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
- NO!
- A YEAR-AND-A-HALF AGO?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
OKAY, STOP.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Woman:
 I'VE TAKEN RACHEL OUT
 A COUPLE TIMES.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
YOU ARE GOOD
AT THOSE EGGS.
ANY SHELLS?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
- NOPE.
- ALL RIGHT!

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Woman: IT'S JUST WONDERFUL, JUST
 THE EASE OF OUR CONVERSATIONS
 AND NOT BEING INTERRUPTED.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
YOU CAN LICK
YOUR FINGERS,
ALL RIGHT.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
YOU KNOW, JUST MAKING THEM
FEEL IMPORTANT.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Man: ONE-ON-ONE WITH ERIKA IS--
 IT'S BEEN A LOT OF FUN.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
SUCH A NICE--
WHAT COLOR ARE YOUR LEGS?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Man: SHE'S GOT A SIMILAR
 SENSE OF HUMOR TO WHAT I HAVE.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
LIKE 'EM GREEN?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
- NO.
- ORANGE?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I'M THE ONLY MALE IN THE HOUSE.
THEY KNOW THAT.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
THEY'RE ALWAYS GIVING ME A HARD
TIME ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
"YEP, DADDY, THERE'S FOUR GIRLS
IN HERE AND ONLY ONE BOY."

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
YOU'RE PULLING YOUR
HAIR OUT, YOU'RE TRYING
TO PREPARE THE MEAL.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
BUT THE JOYS OF
SEEING YOUR CHILDREN

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
WHEN WE'RE ALL TOGETHER
 AS A FAMILY GOING TO THINGS,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
IT'S JUST SO REWARDING
 TO LOOK AT THEM AND BE LIKE,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
"THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN.
 THESE ARE OURS!"

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Woman #2: THEY KNOW HOW MUCH
 THEY LOVE MOMMY AND DADDY,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
BUT YOU KNOW, YOU JUST
 WANT THEM TO KNOW SO MUCH

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
THAT MOMMY AND DADDY LOVE THEM
JUST AS MUCH AND EVEN MORE.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
LISA AND I KID AROUND
WITH EACH OTHER AND SAY,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
"REMEMBER WHEN WE LIVED ON
MARKET STREET BY OURSELVES?
THOSE WERE THE DAYS."

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
AND WE WILL
KID AROUND ABOUT IT

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
BECAUSE WE CAN'T THINK
 OF LIFE ANY OTHER WAY.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER,
 ALMOST LIKE I CAN'T REALLY
 REMEMBER THAT,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
AND I LOVE WATCHING
 THEM GROW.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
JOINING ME TODAY
IS CRYSTAL HOLMES,

OUR INTERNET
 EXPERT FROM IBM.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
- CAN THE INTERNET HELP PARENTS
  WITH ISSUES ABOUT SIBLINGS?
- ABSOLUTELY.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
THERE ARE A LOT OF SITES
FOR PARENTS ON THE INTERNET.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
THE SITE WE'LL GO TO TODAY IS
THE PAMPERS PARENTING INSTITUTE.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
THIS SITE HAS CHAT-ROOMS

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
THAT PARENTS CAN ASK
 QUESTIONS OF OTHER PARENTS
 ABOUT SIBLING ISSUES.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
THEY ALSO CAN GO
 TO BULLETIN BOARDS

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
TO SEE IF ANY ISSUES
 HAVE ALREADY BEEN POSTED,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
AND FIND OUT WHAT
 OTHERS MIGHT SAY.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
THERE ARE ALSO OPTIONS
TO ASK AN EXPERT A QUESTION.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
OUR INTERNET QUESTION
TODAY COMES FROM LINDA
IN PENSACOLA, FLORIDA.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
HER QUESTION IS,
 "WHEN MY OLDEST DAUGHTER,
 AMANDA, WAS 25 MONTHS OLD,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
WE HAD ANOTHER BABY GIRL.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
THE BABY IS NOW TWO MONTHS OLD
 AND SINCE SHE HAS BEEN BORN,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
MY OLDEST DAUGHTER
 KEEPS SAYING,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
'I WANNA GO HOME.'

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
SHE SAYS THIS
 EVEN WHEN SHE IS HOME.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
WHAT DOES SHE MEAN BY THIS,
 AND HOW CAN WE HELP HER?"

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
WELL, I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS
WHAT SHE MEANS.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
SHE WANTS TO GET BACK
TO THE WAY IT USED TO BE,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
AND SHE'D PROBABLY LIKE
TO GET RID OF THAT SISTER

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
AND HAVE HER GO BACK
TO WHERE SHE USED TO BE.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
SO I WOULD DO WHAT YOU CAN
TO MAKE UP TO HER.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I THINK YOU'RE BOTH MOURNING.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
SHE'S MOURNING
FOR WHAT SHE'S LOST

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
IN THE WAY OF
HER RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
AND YOU'RE MOURNING
ABOUT IT TOO.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
SO MAKE UP FOR IT
ANY WAY YOU CAN.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
PICK HER UP IN BETWEEN TIMES
AND LOVE HER AND SAY,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
"I MISS YOU BECAUSE I HAVE TO
 PAY ATTENTION TO THE BABY."

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
TAKE HER OUT
ONCE A DAY BY HERSELF.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
AND THEN ALSO,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I'D JUST LET HER
LEARN HOW TO ADJUST.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
THAT BABY'S HERE TO STAY.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
WITH ME NOW
IS MERI WALLACE,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
THERAPIST, EDUCATOR,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
AND AUTHOR OF
"BIRTH ORDER BLUES."

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
MERI, IS THERE
A SORT OF AN EXPECTANCY

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
WHAT EACH CHILD
IN A BIRTH ORDER MIGHT BE?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
WELL, I'D LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
THE KIND OF
EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
THAT A FIRST-BORN,
 A MIDDLE-BORN

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
AND AN ONLY CHILD
WILL HAVE IN THE FAMILY,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
AND THESE PARTICULAR
EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
WILL AFFECT WHAT HAPPENS TO
THEIR PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
A FIRST-BORN CHILD IS--

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
BENEFITS TREMENDOUSLY
FROM BEING THE SOLE FOCUS

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
OF THE PARENTS' ATTENTION,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
AND CAN BE A LEADER,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
AND CAN GROW UP
FEELING VERY CONFIDENT

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
BECAUSE OF ALL THE LOVE
HE RECEIVED.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
AND HE CAN BECOME
A VERY, VERY HIGH ACHIEVER.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
HOWEVER, THERE ARE
SOME CHALLENGES

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
THAT A FIRST-BORN WILL FACE.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
THE FIRST-BORN CHILD IS OFTEN
PRESSURED VERY HIGHLY

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
BY HIS PARENTS TO SUCCEED,
BECAUSE THE PARENTS WANT TO FEEL

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
THAT THEY'RE VERY GOOD
AT THEIR JOB,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
AND THAT THEIR CHILD
WILL HAVE A GOOD LIFE.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
AND SO THE FIRST-BORN CHILD MAY
END UP BEING VERY SUCCESSFUL,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
BUT MAY END UP BEING
VERY HARD ON HIMSELF.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
- A PERFECTIONIST.
- YES.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
- IT'S NOT EASY.
- NO.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
AND THE SECOND CHILD OFTEN

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
IS A LITTLE BIT
 MORE EASY-GOING,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
WHY, BECAUSE THE PARENTS
ARE VERY MUCH MORE EDUCATED,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
THEY UNDERSTAND
WHAT CHILDREN ARE LIKE,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
THEY'RE CALMER,
AND SO THEY...

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
THEY ALSO HAVE
LESS TIME TO FOCUS

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
AND SCRUTINIZE
THEIR SECOND CHILD.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
SO THE SECOND CHILD
 CAN GO OUT INTO LIFE

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
FEELING MUCH MORE RELAXED.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
HOWEVER, THE SECOND CHILD
OFTEN FEELS VERY INADEQUATE

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
BECAUSE HE LOOKS AT
HIS OLDER SISTER

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
WHO'S ABLE TO
RIDE A TWO-WHEELER

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
AND HE'S
ONLY RIDING A TRICYCLE,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
AND HE CONCLUDES
"WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.
MAYBE I'M NOT AS GOOD."

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
A SECOND CHILD MIGHT BE
VERY HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
WE OFTEN SEE SECOND-BORNS

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
WHO ARE EXTREMELY
COMPETITIVE AND...

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
- AND SUCCESSFUL AT IT.
- AND SUCCESSFUL, YES.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
'CAUSE THEY'VE FOUND
THE ROLE FOR THEMSELVES

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
THAT'S DIFFERENT
FROM THE OLDER ONE?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
YES, AND BECAUSE
 THEY'RE TRYING SO HARD

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
TO BE AS GOOD
AND EVEN BETTER.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
OR THE SECOND CHILD
MIGHT BECOME VERY INTIMIDATED

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
AND DECIDE "I CAN'T BE AS GOOD,
SO I MAY AS WELL NOT TRY."

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
FOR PARENTS

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
TO EXPLAIN TO THE SECOND CHILD
IT'S AN AGE DIFFERENCE.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH YOU,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
YOU'RE JUST AS GOOD
AS YOUR OLDER BROTHER,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER STEPS
 YOU NEED TO TAKE AS WELL.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
YOU NEED TO ENCOURAGE
 THE SECOND-BORN CHILD

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
TO TRY THINGS
THAT HE'S INTERESTED IN,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
THAT HE'S SUCCESSFUL AT,
PRAISE THE YOUNGER CHILD.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
PICK OUT SOMETHING
ABOUT HIM THAT STANDS OUT.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
YES.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
AND THAT WILL GIVE HIM
A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
AND THE THIRD CHILD?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
THE THIRD CHILD
 IS THE BABY OF THE FAMILY,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
AND THE FAMILY
HAS TO BE VERY CAREFUL

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
NOT TO STEP IN AND TAKE OVER

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
AND DO EVERYTHING
FOR THIS YOUNGEST CHILD,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
BECAUSE YOU WANT THIS CHILD
TO BECOME INDEPENDENT.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
OTHERWISE, IN FACT,
THE THIRD CHILD,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
THE YOUNGEST OF THE FAMILY,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
CAN END UP GROWING UP
TO BE VERY DEPENDENT.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
- TO BE A BABY.
- TO BE THE BABY.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
AND I BET
MORE THIRD CHILDREN

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
ARE VULNERABLE CHILDREN
AS A RESULT OF THAT.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
SOMETIMES,
THE PARENTS ARE SO BUSY

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
THEY'RE NOT GIVING
THE YOUNGER SIBLING

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
THAT EXTRA TIME AND ATTENTION,
THAT EXTRA STIMULATION.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
AND IF A CHILD
FELT COMPETENT

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
ABOUT WHAT THEY
WERE TRYING TO DO

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
AND COULD BE RESPECTED
FOR THEIR INDIVIDUALITY,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
THAT WOULD GIVE A CHILD BACK
AN UNDERSTANDING OF THEMSELVES

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
AND ALSO THE MOTIVE

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
TO DEAL WITH FINDING
A ROLE IN THE FAMILY,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
AND THEN
FEELING GOOD ABOUT IT,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
AND THEN BEING READY
TO FIND A ROLE IN,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
YOU KNOW,
IN THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
IF YOU GIVE A CHILD
THE FEELING YOU'RE LOVED

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
AND YOU'RE SPECIAL TO US,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
THEN YOU WILL CUT DOWN
ON THE KIND OF RIVALRY

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
WE SEE IN FAMILIES.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I THINK THERE'S A NORMAL
AMOUNT OF RIVALRY,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
BUT IF YOU GIVE CHILDREN
THAT FEELING OF CONFIDENCE

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
THEN THAT WILL HAPPEN LESS.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
AND SO IN A WAY,
WHAT YOU'VE EXPLAINED TO ME

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
IS THAT EACH
OF THESE CHILDREN

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
HAS TO GET BACK
THE FEELING THAT "I MATTER."

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
ABSOLUTELY.
THAT'S THE KEY.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
AND I THINK THAT YOU
HAVE TO VALUE YOUR CHILD,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
AND WHO THE CHILD IS,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
AND NOT TRY TO PUSH THE CHILD
TO BE SOMETHING ELSE.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
AND THE MOMENT
YOU STAY WITH YOUR CHILD

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
AND APPRECIATE HIM
FOR WHO HE IS,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
HE WILL FEEL LOVED, AND HE
WILL BE VERY HAPPY IN LIFE.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Brazelton: NEXT, WE TALK TO
 PARENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Woman: WE'VE SOLD OUT.
 WE HAVE OVER 900 PEOPLE...

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Brazelton: EACH YEAR,
 WE TRAVEL ALL OVER AMERICA...

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Man: OUR COMMUNITY
 IS SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Brazelton:
 ...TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
 FROM THOUSANDS OF PARENTS.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Emcee: I'D LIKE TO WELCOME
 DR. T. BERRY BRAZELTON.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Brazelton:
 HERE ARE SOME OF THEM.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
- HI.
- Brazelton: HI.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
MY NAME IS ANN-MARIE,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
AND I'M THE YOUNGEST
OF THREE CHILDREN

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
WITH A LARGE SPAN IN AGES,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
AND I'VE NEVER DEALT
WITH SIBLING RIVALRY.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
I NOW HAVE A
TWO-AND-A-HALF YEAR OLD,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
AND A FOUR-AND-A-HALF YEAR OLD,
WHO ARE GREAT KIDS,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
BUT SEEM TO FIGHT
THE SECOND I LEAVE THE ROOM.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
AND I KNOW THAT'S NORMAL.
I GUESS MY BIGGEST QUESTION

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
IS HOW DO I
HELP TO FOSTER

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM
AS THEY GROW UP TOGETHER?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Brazelton: BY STAYING OUT OF IT
 AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
BY TURNING IT BACK TO THEM.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
THE SECOND YOU GET INTO IT,
YOU MAKE A TRIANGLE

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
AND THEY-- THEIR WHOLE FOCUS
THEN IS ON YOU,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
NOT ON EACH OTHER.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
AND SIBLING RIVALRY IS ONE WAY
THEY LEARN ABOUT EACH OTHER.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
THINK WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING
WITH EACH OTHER.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
HAVE YOU EVER
WATCHED THEM TOGETHER?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
THEY LEARN A LOT.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
AND A TWO-AND-A-HALF YEAR OLD

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
I'LL BET, CAN TAKE CARE OF
HIMSELF BY NOW, CAN'T HE?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
- SHE.  AND SHE DOES.
- EXACTLY.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
- THINK, ISN'T THAT REMARKABLE?
- YES.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
AND THE FOUR-AND-A-HALF YEAR OLD

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
PROBABLY KNOWS WHERE
TO PUSH HER BUTTONS,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
AND SO THEY'VE LEARNED
A LOT ABOUT EACH OTHER,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
AND I ALWAYS SAY THAT RIVALRY
IS ONE SIDE OF A COIN,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
AND CARING ABOUT
EACH OTHER IS THE OTHER.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
OKAY.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
AND WITHOUT
 THAT OPPORTUNITY

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
TO DO IT DIRECTLY
 WITH EACH OTHER

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
THEY REALLY DON'T EVER
GET THAT CLOSE.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
SO I'D STAY OUT OF IT
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
AND THEN YOU MIGHT SAY,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
"WELL, BUT THEY MIGHT
  HURT EACH OTHER."

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
THEY DON'T.
IF YOU'RE THERE, THEY WILL.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
BUT CHILDREN DON'T
IF YOU'RE NOT THERE.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
I FIND MORE OFTEN THEY DO IT
WHEN I LEAVE THE ROOM.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
- IS THAT TO GET MY ATTENTION?
- GET YOU BACK.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
- DON'T YOU?
- YES.  I'D BE UPSTAIRS,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
AND THAT'S WHEN THEY START,
AND THAT'S WHAT CONCERNS ME

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
WHEN THE SCREAMING AND THE...

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
AND THEY'RE BACK
DO I STEP IN?  DO I...?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
MAYBE YOU HAVE
 TO PREPARE FOR THAT

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
AND SAY AS YOU'RE
 LEAVING THE ROOM,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
"YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT GOING TO HEAR YOU.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I'VE GOT THE TV UP TOO LOUD,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
SO WHATEVER YOU DO
IS UP TO YOU GUYS.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
AND HERE ARE THE BAND-AIDS
AND HERE..."

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
( laughs )

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
"HERE IS THE IPECAC
IN CASE YOU INGEST FOOD."

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
AND JUST REALLY LET 'EM KNOW
THAT IT'S UP TO THEM.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
EVEN WITH A TWO-YEAR OLD?
SHE'S ON HER OWN?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
ESPECIALLY WITH
A TWO-YEAR-OLD.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I'LL BET SHE'S THE INSTIGATOR
IN MOST CASES.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
OH, YES.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
SHE IS.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I HAD A LITTLE BROTHER,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
AND I COULD HAVE KILLED HIM
UNTIL HE WAS 50.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
BUT THEY SHOULD BE OKAY
FOR THE LONG RUN?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
- TRY IT.
- OKAY.  THANK YOU.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
( applause )

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
MY NAME IS ROBIN

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW
IF IT'S NORMAL FOR MY SON

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
WHO IS 20 MONTHS OLDER
THAN MY DAUGHTER,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
TO TACKLE HER, HIT HER.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
HE DOESN'T PLAY WITH HER,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
HE WOULD RATHER
WRESTLE WITH HER.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
MY DAUGHTER'S
THIRTEEN MONTHS OLD,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
MY SON IS TWO YEARS,
NINE MONTHS.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
SHE TRIES TO BITE HIM,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
WHICH I TRY TO STOP.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
WHY DO YOU STOP HER
FROM FIGHTING BACK?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
IF IT'S A PROCESS
OF FIGHTING OVER A TOY,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
THEN I LET HER FIGHT BACK.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
BUT IF SHE WANTS
TO BITE HIM,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I DON'T REALLY
WANT HER TO BITE HIM.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
- YOU DON'T LIKE BITING?
-NO.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
IT IS AN ISSUE FOR
ALMOST ALL TODDLERS.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
RIGHT.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE
SHE'S TRYING TO LEARN

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
HOW TO MANAGE HIM HERSELF

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
RATHER THAN
HAVING YOU STEP IN.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
AND YOU DO STEP IN
 EVERY TIME?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
- I DO.
- DO YOU?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
YOU CLENCH YOUR TEETH?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
IS IT, "I'M GONNA
GET BACK IN THERE

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
AND I'LL TRY NOT TO
BITE HIM MYSELF,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
BUT I'M READY TO"?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I FEEL.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
I CAN SEE THAT.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
AND I FEEL LIKE
MY HUSBAND AND I

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
ARE ALWAYS ON TOP OF HIM,
"STOP IT, LEAVE HER ALONE,"

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
AND INSTEAD OF REWARDING HIM

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
FOR THE GOOD THINGS
THAT HE DOES,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
AND MY HUSBAND DOES
 WRESTLE WITH HIM,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT
HAS SOMETHING TO DO

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
WITH WHY HE THINKS HE
SHOULD WRESTLE HIS SISTER.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
WELL, I DON'T EITHER,
BUT IT SOUNDS WONDERFUL.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
I THINK THAT HE
SOMETIMES IS JEALOUS,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GIVE HER
A LOT OF ATTENTION,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
AND I TRY TO DO
 A LOT WITH HIM

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
SO THAT HE DOESN'T
FEEL LEFT OUT.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
AND HE JUST
STARTED PRE-SCHOOL,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
SO I THINK THAT MAKES
THE PROBLEM EVEN WORSE,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
BECAUSE HE FIGURES I'M
LEAVING HIM AND I'M WITH HER.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
SURE. IT'S REALLY VERY
PAINFUL FOR YOU.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
YOU TALK ABOUT DESERTING HIM
AS IF IT WERE A REAL DESERTION.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
IT'S JUST AWFUL.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
AND HE PLAYS WELL
WITH OTHER CHILDREN,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
AND HE LISTENS TO ME
AT PLAY-GROUP.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
BUT IT'S HIS SISTER, AS IF
HE'S SO ANGRY I HAD HER.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
YEAH.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
AND SOMETIMES
IT BREAKS MY HEART,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
"OH, I DID ALL THIS."

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
YOU FEEL LIKE,
"I SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD HER."

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF
THERE WAS ANYTHING I COULD DO

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
TO TRY AND STOP THE FIGHTING.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
- THE SIBLING RIVALRY?
- MM-HMM.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
WELL, I'M JUST WONDERING
 HOW REALLY IMPORTANT IT IS

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
TO STOP IT,
OR WHETHER IT'S...

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
WHETHER YOU'RE MAKING IT,
YOU KNOW,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
HEIGHTENING IT A LITTLE BIT
BY TRYING TO STOP IT.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
THE OLDER CHILD
FEELS SHOWED UP, CAN'T YOU?

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
I DO.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
YOUR VOICE BEGINS TO
EVEN CRACK UP A LITTLE BIT

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
- IF YOU TALK OF...
- 'CAUSE I FEEL BAD FOR HIM.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
YEAH, AND MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
AT 13 MONTHS, MAYBE SHE ISN'T
QUITE READY YET TO ...

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
YOU KNOW, TO LEAVE,
TO FIGHT IT OUT.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
WHEN THEY CAN
 DEAL WITH IT THEMSELVES,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT
BETTER RELATIONSHIP.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
AND I'LL TELL YOU, I'VE NEVER
 HEARD OF A CHILD HURTING A BABY

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
UNLESS THERE'S
A PARENT INVOLVED.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
NOW THAT MEANS YOU'VE
 GOT TO LEAVE THE ROOM

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
BY SAYING "LOOK,
IT'S UP TO YOU GUYS

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO MAKE IT GO

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
'CAUSE I'M NO GOOD FOR YOU."

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
AND THEN CLOSE THE DOOR FIRMLY,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
- AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
- OKAY.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
I THINK THAT YOU'VE GOT
SOME WONDERFUL INSIGHTS.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000

BRAZELTON ON PARENTING,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
PRESENTED BY
 THE PARENTING INSTITUTE

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
AT pampers.com.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
RAISING MORE THAN ONE CHILD

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
PRESENTS A PARENT WITH
SOME PRETTY BIG CHALLENGES.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
BUT FOR ALL THE TROUBLE
AND CONSTANT BICKERING,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
THE TRUTH IS THAT
A SIBLING GIVES A CHILD

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY
TO LEARN ABOUT THE WORLD.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
HOW TO STAND UP FOR YOURSELF,
HOW TO NEGOTIATE,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
HOW TO SHARE--
THESE ARE IMPORTANT SKILLS,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
AND WORKING IT OUT
WITH A BROTHER OR A SISTER

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
IS HOW KIDS DEVELOP THEM.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
SO THROUGH ALL THE TURMOIL,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
KEEP PERSPECTIVE,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
AND REALIZE HOW MUCH YOUR KIDS
MEAN TO EACH OTHER,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
NOW, AND FOR THE REST
OF THEIR LIVES.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
