WEBVTT

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.300
THE GANGES IS THE MOST
VENERATED RIVER ON EARTH.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.730
ON ITS 2,500 KILOMETER JOURNEY
FROM SOURCE TO SEA IT FLOWS

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.460
THROUGH THE PHYSICAL AND
SPIRITUAL HEART OF INDIA.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.030
TO BATHE IN THESE WATERS
IS SAID TO PURIFY THE SOUL.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.460
TO DIE ON THE RIVERBANK IS
TO GAIN ENTRY TO HEAVEN.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.430
THE GANGES'
SPIRITUAL INFLUENCE

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.130
IS MATCHED BY ITS
PHYSICAL POWER.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.330
THE RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES
SUPPORT HALF A BILLION PEOPLE.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.730
BUT TODAY A CRISIS IS
LOOMING WHICH THREATENS

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.260
TO TURN THIS RIVER OF LIFE
INTO A RIVER OF DEATH.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.930
AS INDIA'S POPULATION KEEPS
GROWING, THE POLLUTION CREATED

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.930
BY ITS PEOPLE IS DEFILING THE
WATERS WHICH THEY WORSHIP.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.530
EACH YEAR OVER A
MILLION YOUNG CHILDREN

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.160
ARE POISONED
BY THIS RIVER.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.460
TODAY THE GANGES, THOUGH
HOLY, IS LESS THAN PURE.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.630
NO RIVER ON EARTH HAS AS MUCH
INFLUENCE OVER ITS PEOPLE

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.930
AS THE GANGES.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.830
TO MILLIONS OF INDIANS THIS
RIVER IS A PHYSICAL LIFELINE

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.000
PROVIDING THEIR ONLY
SOURCE OF FRESH WATER.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.230
TO HINDU BELIEVERS
THE GANGES IS ALSO THE

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.760
EARTHLY FORM OF
THE GODDESS GANGA.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.530
ITS WATERS ARE SAID TO
BE SO POWERFUL THAT

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.860
JUST A DROP CAN
CLEANSE THE BODY OF SIN.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.900
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS THIS
RIVER HAS BEEN THE BEDROCK

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.960
OF INDIAN CULTURE
AND BELIEF.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.030
TO THE PEOPLE
SHE IS THE MOTHER

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.900
WHO GRANTS THEM
ETERNAL SALVATION.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.460
BUT IN RECENT TIMES
THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.860
OF THIS WATER HAS
BEEN THREATENED.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.560
WHILE THE HIMALAYAN GLACIERS
WHICH FEED THE RIVER

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.030
ARE RETREATING, THE
AMOUNT OF POLLUTION

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.160
ENTERING THE WATERS
IS RISING DAY BY DAY.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.030
WITHIN A GENERATION THE
GANGES MIGHT NOT ONLY BE

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.600
TOO POLLUTED TO USE,
IT MIGHT CEASE TO EXIST.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.100
TODAY THE PEOPLE OF INDIA ARE
FACING THE GREATEST CHALLENGE

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.960
IN THE HISTORY OF THE GANGES:
HOW TO PURIFY A RIVER

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.530
WHICH TO THEM IS THE
EMBODIMENT OF PURITY ITSELF.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.900
IN HINDU CULTURE ORDINARY
WATER IS BELIEVED TO HAVE

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.260
EXTRAORDINARY POWERS.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.700
MILLIONS OF INDIANS FOLLOW
A DAILY RITUAL OF POURING

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.830
A HANDFUL OVER THEMSELVES
TO REMOVE THE IMPURITIES

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.300
WHICH ACCUMULATE IN
THE COURSE OF THE DAY.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.730
WHEN WATER IS MOVING IN A
RIVER, IT'S EVEN MORE PRECIOUS

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.060
SINCE IT CARRIES ANY
POLLUTION AWAY IN ITS FLOW.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.160
ALL OF INDIA'S MAJOR RIVERS
ARE CONSIDERED TO BE HOLY,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.460
BUT THE RIVER GANGES
IS THE HOLIEST OF ALL.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.430
FROM ITS SOURCE IN THE HIMALAYAS
TO ITS DELTA IN BENGAL

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.000
THE GANGES CREATES A
RIVER BASIN THAT SUPPORTS

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.760
ONE-TENTH OF THE
WORLD'S POPULATION.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.060
BUT ACCORDING TO
ANCIENT HINDU SCRIPTURES

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.930
THE RIVER GANGES
ORIGINALLY FLOWED IN HEAVEN.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.460
LONG AGO SHE AGREED TO FALL
TO EARTH TO HELP HUMANKIND

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.200
BY CLEANSING AND RESURRECTING
THE ASHES OF THE DEAD.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.000
TO SAVE THE WORLD FROM THE
IMPACT OF THE RIVER'S DESCENT,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.560
THE HINDU GOD LORD SHIVA
CAUGHT THE GANGES IN HIS HAIR.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.360
TODAY A WHOLE CULTURE OF WORSHIP
HAS SPRUNG UP AROUND THE PLACE

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.100
WHERE THIS MYSTICAL EVENT
IS SAID TO HAVE HAPPENED.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.560
SITUATED AT THE FOOT OF
THE HIMALAYAS, GANGOTRI

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.260
IS THE FIRST TOWN THROUGH
WHICH THE GANGES FLOWS

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.860
ON ITS COURSE FROM
MOUNTAIN TO SEA.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.800
THIS ALSO MARKS THE PLACE
WHERE THE RIVER GANGES

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.830
IS SAID TO HAVE FALLEN
FROM HEAVEN TO EARTH.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.960
IN WINTER GANGOTRI IS
SNOWBOUND AND DESOLATE

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.500
BUT AS SOON AS THE ICE
MELTS AND THE ROADS OPEN

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.330
THE PLACE COMES ALIVE WITH
THOUSANDS OF PILGRIMS.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.760
VISITING THE GANGES AT
GANGOTRI IS ONE OF THE MOST

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.000
POWERFUL PILGRIMAGES
A HINDU CAN MAKE.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.160
AT AN ALTITUDE OF
OVER 3,000 METERS,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.630
REACHING GANGOTRI
IS NO SMALL TASK.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.500
MOST PILGRIMS ARRIVE BY BUS,
ENDURING A JOURNEY OF DAYS ON

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.960
OVERCROWDED COACHES ALONG
TREACHEROUS MOUNTAIN ROADS.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.960
WHEN THEY EVENTUALLY SET FOOT
ON SOLID GROUND, FOREMOST IN

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.830
THEIR MIND IS REACHING THE RIVER
WHICH THEY CALL MOTHER GANGA.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.030
ONCE AT THE WATERS' EDGE
THEY FULFILL THEIR PILGRIMAGE

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.330
BY BATHING IN THE
ICE COLD FLOW.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.730
JUST AS GODDESS GANGA CAME TO
CLEANSE THE ASHES OF HUMANKIND,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:01.330
THESE PILGRIMS BELIEVE THAT THE
RIVER WILL REMOVE THEIR SINS.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:07.260
HERE, WHERE THE RIVER RUNS FAST
AND PURE, ITS CLEANSING POWERS

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.600
ARE THOUGHT TO BE
PARTICULARLY STRONG.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.860
TO THANK THE RIVER FOR PURIFYING
THEM THE PILGRIMS MAY OFFER

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.860
PRAYERS AT THE TEMPLE; BUILT, SO
IT IS SAID, OVER THE EXACT ROCK

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:25.300
UPON WHICH LORD SHIVA SAT TO
RECEIVE THE GANGES IN HIS HAIR.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.600
SOME PILGRIMS EMPLOY
PRIESTS TO CONDUCT

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.860
PRIVATE CEREMONIES
OF DEVOTION.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.630
FOR A FEW RUPEES' PAYMENT THEY
MAKE OFFERINGS TO MOTHER GANGA

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.600
ON THE PILGRIM'S BEHALF.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.130
THE EFFORT OF REACHING GANGOTRI
MEANS THAT ONLY DEVOUT PILGRIMS

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.460
ARE PREPARED TO ENDURE THE
LONG COACH JOURNEY TO GET HERE.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.900
BUT THE MOST DEVOUT OF
ALL DO NOT TRAVEL BY BUS.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.330
THEY CHOOSE TO WALK
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.830
TRANSLATOR: I HAVE
COME FROM BENARES.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.000
IT'S VERY FAR. IT'S
1,000 KILOMETERS AWAY.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.200
I WALKED ALL THE WAY. IT
TOOK ME THREE MONTHS.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.960
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY AND BY
BEGGING FOR FOOD AND DRINK

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.730
I MANAGED TO
COME HERE.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.960
>>NANI NEFH IS A SADHU,
LITERALLY MEANING "GOOD MAN".

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.730
HE IS ONE OF SOME FOUR
MILLION SADHUS IN INDIA

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.300
WHO TURN THEIR BACK
ON THE REAL WORLD

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.260
AND DEDICATE THEIR LIVES TO
THE CONTEMPLATION OF GOD.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.900
FOR THESE MEN, PILGRIMAGE IS A
WAY OF LIFE AND ENDURING THE

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.330
HARDSHIP OF WALKING TO GANGOTRI
IS A SIGN OF THEIR DEVOTION.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.600
LIVING ON CHARITY AND DONATIONS,
SOME SADHUS WEAR ORANGE

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.130
CLOTHING TO SYMBOLIZE THEIR
REJECTION OF MATERIAL THINGS.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.260
SOME, LIKE NANI, COVER
THEMSELVES IN ASH

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.860
AS A SIGN OF
AUSTERITY.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.630
FOR SADHUS, COMING TO GANGOTRI
IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THEIR

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.630
LIFELONG QUEST TO WORSHIP
THE DEITIES, AMONG WHOM

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:11.700
GODDESS GANGA IS ONE
OF THE MOST POWERFUL.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.300
TRANSLATOR: EVERY
MORNING I GET UP, BATHE,

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.560
PERFORM MY RITUALS
AND APPLY ASH.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.860
I PERFORM PRAYERS TO THE MOTHER
GANGA AND FOR THE PEOPLE.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.530
THEN HAVING HAD
MY MEAL AND WATER

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.800
AND AFTER THE EVENING
PRAYER I HAVE TO SLEEP.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.100
THE NEXT MORNING I WAKE
UP AT 4:00 AND BATHE AGAIN.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.330
THIS IS HOW ONE HAS
TO LIVE IN GANGOTRI.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.530
>>BUT FOR THE MOST
DEVOUT PILGRIMS

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.960
GANGOTRI IS NOT THE
END OF THE JOURNEY.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.660
MANY CONTINUE WALKING 17
KILOMETERS BEYOND THE TOWN,

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.800
ACROSS THE GANGOTRI GLACIER
TO THE ICE CAVE AT GAMOOK.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.160
LITERALLY MEANING "COW'S
MOUTH", THIS ICE CAVE CONTAINS

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.700
THE MILKY GLACIAL SPRING
WHICH FEEDS THE GANGES.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.200
AS THE SPIRITUAL SOURCE OF
THE RIVER, HINDUS BELIEVE

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.000
THAT THE WATERS' CLEANSING
POWERS HERE ARE SUBLIME.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.300
BUT THE EXACT LOCATION
OF THIS SPRING HAS SHIFTED

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.630
OVER THE COURSE OF
TIME AS THE ICE FIELDS

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.260
WHICH FEED THE RIVER
HAVE RETREATED.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.930
ONE MAN WHO'S WATCHED THIS
ALARMING TRANSFORMATION

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.430
TAKE PLACE IS
SWAMI SANDARAM.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.900
HE NOW LIVES IN GANGOTRI
BUT FIRST VISITED THE TOWN

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:34.730
AS A YOUNG PILGRIM.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:39.830
TRANSLATOR: I FIRST
CAME TO GANGOTRI IN 1948.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:45.260
GANGOTRI IS
AT 10,300 FEET.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.600
THE FLOWERS THAT WERE
HERE AT THAT TIME, THE DEER,

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.360
THE BROWN BEAR, THE WHITE
BEAR, THEY DISAPPEARED.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.500
AT THAT TIME THERE
WERE ONLY FOUR HOUSES.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.660
NOW AN ENTIRE TOWN
HAS SETTLED HERE.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.760
>>THE HOUSE WHICH SWAMI
SANDARAM BUILT FOR HIMSELF

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.430
IS A TESTAMENT TO HIS LIFELONG
PASSION FOR PHOTOGRAPHY.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.700
WHEN HE TRAVELED ON
FROM GANGOTRI TO GAMOOK,

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.930
HE TOOK HIS
CAMERA WITH HIM.

TRANSLATOR:
FROM RIGHT TO LEFT,

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.360
THIS IS A PANORAMA
OF EIGHT PHOTOGRAPHS.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.600
BEHIND THE SHIVLING PEAK
IS THE MERU GLACIER.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:34.500
IT MEETS THE GANGOTRI
GLACIER OVER HERE.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.430
NOW THE GANGOTRI
GLACIER AT GAMOOK

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:41.800
HAS RECEDED BY
THREE KILOMETERS.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:48.730
ITS THICKNESS HAS BEEN
REDUCED BY ONE KILOMETER.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.900
>>SWAMI'S PHOTOGRAPHS
DOCUMENT THE DISTURBING CHANGES

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:56.900
WHICH ARE HAPPENING ON
THE HIMALAYAN ICE FIELDS.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:03.500
EACH YEAR THE GANGOTRI
GLACIER SHRINKS BY 25 METERS.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.630
THIS WOULD EXPLAIN THE APPARENT
CONFUSION IN RELIGIOUS ACCOUNTS

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.660
OF WHERE THE
GANGES BEGINS.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.860
FOR THOUGH THE GLACIAL SPRING
WHICH FEEDS THE RIVER RISES

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.500
TODAY AT GAMOOK, 4,000 YEARS
AGO WHEN THE HINDU SCRIPTURES

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.800
WERE WRITTEN THE GLACIER
WOULD HAVE EXTENDED

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.800
ALL THE WAY TO GANGOTRI,
GIVING RISE TO THE LEGEND

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:27.500
THAT IS WAS HERE THE
GANGES FELL TO EARTH.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.930
THE GLACIER IS SHRINKING
FOR TWO REASONS.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.730
IT'S CLEAR GLOBAL
WARMING HAS A PART TO PLAY

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:37.900
BUT THE PILGRIMS THEMSELVES
ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.200
TO FEED GANGOTRI'S RELIGIOUS
TOURISM INDUSTRY, THOUSANDS

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.430
OF TREES ARE BEING CUT
DOWN FOR FUEL AND BUILDING,

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:49.500
CAUSING EROSION AND
WEAKENING THE GLACIAL WALLS.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.960
TRANSLATOR: DUE TO HOT WEATHER,
DEFORESTATION AND FIRES

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:59.700
AND MODERN DEVELOPMENT,
THE WILDLIFE HAS BEEN KILLED

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:06.360
AND THE GANGOTRI GLACIER IS
RECEDING FURTHER AND FURTHER.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:14.530
IN THE NEXT 50 YEARS THE
ETERNAL GLACIER WILL DISAPPEAR.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:20.030
INDIA AND THE WHOLE WORLD
WILL PINE FOR JUST A DROP

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:26.660
OF GANGES WATER.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.830
>>EXPERTS WARN THAT AT THIS
RATE THE GLACIER WILL DISAPPEAR

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.230
BY 2035 AND THE SPIRITUAL
SOURCE OF THE GANGES

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.560
WILL DRY UP COMPLETELY.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.760
THE EFFECTS OF SUCH AN
EVENT WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.360
FOR ALL THOSE WHO
DEPEND ON THESE WATERS

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:51.030
TO SUSTAIN BOTH THEIR
BODY AND THEIR SOUL.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:56.830
FROM GANGOTRI THE GANGES
PLUNGES DOWNSTREAM

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.960
THROUGH THE RUGGED
MOUNTAINS OF NORTHERN INDIA,

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.330
BRINGING LIFE
TO THE LAND.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.260
IN THESE POOR AND REMOTE
REGIONS, THE RIVER PROVIDES

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.460
THE ONLY SOURCE
OF FRESH WATER.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:15.200
IN A COUNTRY WHICH SUFFERS
SEVERE WATER SHORTAGES,

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:21.760
THIS IS THE GREATEST GIFT
THE GANGES CAN BESTOW.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:27.660
LATER ALONG ITS COURSE THE RIVER
SUSTAINS MANY MORE PEOPLE AS ITS

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:33.000
WATERS ARE DIVERTED AND PUMPED
TO THIRSTY CITIES AND TOWNS.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.830
TODAY THE GANGES AND
ITS TRIBUTARIES SUPPORT

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:41.230
HALF THE POPULATION
OF INDIA.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.630
AS WELL AS QUENCHING PEOPLE'S
THIRST, THE RIVER SUSTAINS

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:52.600
THEIR LIVESTOCK AND
FERTILIZES THEIR LAND.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.800
THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT
THE GANGES CARRIES MORE SILT

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.830
THAN ANY OTHER
RIVER IN THE WORLD.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:04.430
MINERAL-RICH SEDIMENT ERODED
FROM THE HIMALAYAN ROCKS

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.030
IS CARRIED ALONG IN THE
FLOW AND DEPOSITED ACROSS

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:13.500
THE RIVER VALLEYS, CREATING
RICH AGRICULTURAL SOILS.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.430
IT'S NO WONDER THAT THE
GIFTS WHICH THE RIVER BRINGS

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:20.530
ARE SEEN AS BLESSINGS
FROM THE GODDESS.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:25.730
SOME 225 KILOMETERS
DOWNSTREAM OF GANGOTRI

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.730
IS THE TOWN
OF HARIDWAR.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.960
HARIDWAR IS REVERED AS THE
PLACE WHERE THE GANGES

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.900
LEAVES THE MOUNTAINS
AND ENTERS THE PLAINS,

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.200
BECOMING THE FORCE
WHICH FERTILIZES THE LAND.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.700
EACH YEAR, 18 MILLION PEOPLE
VISIT THE TOWN TO CELEBRATE

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:47.900
THIS CRUCIAL JUNCTION
IN THE RIVER'S STORY.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:53.700
THE STEEP RIVER SLOPES ARE LINED
WITH SPECIALLY BUILT STEPS

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.100
KNOWN AS GHATS, TO ALLOW
EASY ACCESS FOR BATHING.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.900
BUT ANYONE ENTERING THESE
WATERS TAKES A BIG RISK;

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.900
FOR HERE, WHERE THE GANGES
CHANGES FROM MOUNTAIN TORRENT

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:11.600
TO MIGHTY WATERWAY, THE
CURRENT IS PARTICULARLY STRONG.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.860
EACH YEAR SEVERAL
PEOPLE ARE WASHED AWAY

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.500
BY THE RAGING WATERS.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.300
YET IT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE
OF THE FAST WATERS

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.830
THAT THE WORSHIPPERS
FLOCK TO BATHE HERE.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.560
THE RAPID CURRENT IS PROOF
THAT THE RIVER ARRIVES

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.330
FRESH AND PURE
FROM THE MOUNTAINS.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.560
WHAT'S MORE, HARIDWAR IS
ONE OF THE FIRST MAJOR TOWNS

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.460
DOWNSTREAM OF THE
GANGES' SOURCE

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.730
THAT IS EASILY REACHED BY
ROAD, MAKING IT ONE OF

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:50.900
THE MOST POPULAR
PILGRIMAGE SITES IN INDIA.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.800
SINCE IT'S THE RELIGIOUS
OBLIGATION OF EVERY HINDU

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.000
TO MAKE AT LEAST ONE VISIT TO
THE GANGES IN THEIR LIFETIME,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.030
COMING TO HARIDWAR IS A
CHANCE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:05.830
TO FULFILL THEIR DUTY.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:12.130
THE TOWN IS SET UP TO CATER FOR
THIS MASS RELIGIOUS TOURISM.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:17.060
FROM THE SHADE OF THEIR WOODEN
SHELTERS, HINDU PRIESTS OFFER

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.800
A VARIETY OF SERVICES FROM
ARRANGING ACCOMMODATION

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.200
TO CONDUCTING
RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:31.160
ONE WHICH IS PARTICULARLY
IMPORTANT TO HINDU FAMILIES

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.100
IS THE MUNDAN, A HEAD
SHAVING CEREMONY PERFORMED

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:39.400
IN THE FIRST OR
THIRD YEAR OF LIFE.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.800
THE HAIR PRESENT AT BIRTH
REPRESENTS UNWANTED TRAITS

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.100
FROM PAST LIVES.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.030
TO ENSURE THE CHILD
DOESN'T CARRY BAD QUALITIES

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.100
FROM THE PAST TO THE
PRESENT, THE HEAD IS SHAVED

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:57.960
AND THE OLD HAIR THROWN TO
THE GANGES TO BE PURIFIED.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:03.300
FAMILIES GO TO EXTRAORDINARY
LENGTHS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.860
CHILDREN'S MUNDAN CEREMONY
TAKES PLACE ON THE GANGES.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:18.060
BEFORE LEAVING HARIDWAR
EVEN THE MOST PIOUS TOURISTS

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.400
LIKE TO BUY A
MEMENTO OF THEIR VISIT.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.860
AMONG THE MOST POPULAR
GIFTS ARE SEALED VIALS

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:26.500
OF RIVER WATER
KNOWN AS GANGAJAL.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.100
THE LABEL CLAIMS THAT ADDING
A FEW DROPS OF GANGAJAL

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.630
TO YOUR BATH WILL EASE
ALL KINDS OF ILLNESS

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.900
AND RID THE
BODY OF SIN.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.460
MOST LOCALS, HOWEVER,
CHOOSE TO BUY A PLASTIC BOTTLE

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:42.200
WHICH THEY FILL UP
FOR THEMSELVES.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.160
WHAT SEEMS LIKE A CHEAP GIFT
IS IN FACT THE MOST PRECIOUS

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.130
SOUVENIR ANY VISITOR CAN TAKE
HOME, FOR HINDUS BELIEVE

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.400
GANGAJAL HAS
SUPERNATURAL POWERS.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.660
IT'S CLAIMED THAT, NEVER
MIND HOW LONG IT'S KEPT,

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.630
GANGES WATER DOES
NOT DETERIORATE

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.830
BUT STAYS FRESH EVEN
WHEN EXPOSED TO THE AIR.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.900
IT'S EVEN SAID THAT MOSQUITOS
CAN'T BREED IN GANGAJAL.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:14.130
THE PILGRIMS BELIEVE THE
RIVER POSSESSES THESE POWERS

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:19.730
BECAUSE IT'S THE EARTHLY
FORM OF THE GODDESS GANGA.

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:24.460
BUT SOME SEEK A MORE
SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.830
DOWNSTREAM OF THE MAIN
BATHING GHATS, DR. DEWAR LEADS

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.830
A TEAM OF SCIENTISTS FROM
THE MALARIA RESEARCH CENTER,

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:36.200
TAKING SAMPLES OF
GANGES WATER FOR ANALYSIS.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.160
THROUGH STUDYING THE PRECISE
COMPOSITION OF THESE SAMPLES,

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.330
DOCTOR DEWAR'S TEAM
HAVE REVEALED THAT

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:45.500
GANGAJAL DOES HAVE
UNIQUE QUALITIES.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.900
TRANSLATOR: IT'S TRUE THAT
GANGAJAL HAS A HIGHER LEVEL OF

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.330
DISSOLVED OXYGEN COMPARED
TO WATER FROM OTHER AREAS.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.700
THIS IS FIRSTLY DUE TO THE
FAST FLOW OF THE RIVER,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.560
AND SECONDLY THE
TURBULENCE OF THE WATER.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.900
THE WATER IS VERY TURBULENT
AND WE THINK THAT IS WHY

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:07.760
IT HAS HIGHER LEVELS
OF DISSOLVED OXYGEN.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.500
>>THE SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT
THE HIGH LEVELS OF OXYGEN

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.360
IN GANGAJAL MAKE IT DIFFICULT
FOR BACTERIA TO REPRODUCE.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:21.030
THIS WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THE
WATER STAYS FRESH FOR SO LONG.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:27.000
BUT TODAY, DAM AND WATER
DIVERSION PROJECTS

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.030
ARE ALTERING THE FLOW
OF THE RIVER CURRENT

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:35.730
AND SO THREATENING THE WATER'S
SELF CLEANSING QUALITIES.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:40.100
TRANSLATOR: WE KNOW THAT WHEN
DAMS ARE BUILT, THE WATER FLOW

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:44.800
DECREASES AND SO MOSQUITO
BREEDING POTENTIAL INCREASES.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.430
WHEREVER THE WATER
BECOMES STAGNANT,

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:51.100
MOSQUITO BREEDING WILL
AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.300
BECAUSE OF THIS WE ARE
UNDERTAKING STUDIES

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.330
IN THE HARIDWAR REGION.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.760
WE IMMERSE MOSQUITO
LARVAE IN THE WATER

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.530
TO SEE WHETHER MOSQUITOES
BREED IN IT OR NOT.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.000
WE CHECK THIS IN
OUR LABORATORIES.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.100
WE NOW BELIEVE THAT
MOSQUITO BREEDING

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:09.200
DOES HAPPEN
IN GANGAJAL.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.860
>>DOCTOR DEWAR'S RESEARCH
NOT ONLY EXPLODES THE MYTH

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.800
THAT MOSQUITOS CAN'T BREED IN
GANGAJAL, IT'S ALSO THE FIRST

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.960
CLUE TO A TERRIBLE CRISIS WHICH
THREATENS THE RIVER TODAY.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.260
AS IT CONTINUES ITS
COURSE THROUGH THE LAND,

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.200
THERE'S A GROWING
CONTRADICTION BETWEEN

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.360
THE RELIGIOUS VIEW
OF THE RIVER'S PURITY

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.660
AND THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL
STATE OF ITS WATERS.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.130
AS NIGHT FALLS ON HARIDWAR,
PILGRIMS CONGREGATE

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:46.460
FOR THE EVENING PRAYER
CEREMONY CALLED GANGA AARTI,

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:52.430
MEANING "RIVER WORSHIP".

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:56.030
THIS IS A POWERFUL CELEBRATION
OF THE LIFE-GIVING QUALITIES

00:20:56.030 --> 00:21:01.930
WHICH THE GANGES CARRIES FORTH
FROM HERE TO FERTILIZE THE LAND.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:07.660
BUT THE BEAUTY OF THE RITUAL
BELIES A TERRIBLE IRONY...

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.430
FOR WHILE HARIDWAR IS
WHERE THE GANGES MATURES

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:15.060
INTO A MIGHTY RIVER, IT
ALSO MARKS THE PLACE WHERE

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.860
THIS RIVER OF LIFE BEGINS
A BITTER BATTLE TO SURVIVE

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.660
THE POLLUTION AND EXCESSES
OF THE MODERN WORLD.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.060
LEAVING THE HIMALAYAS
AND HARIDWAR BEHIND,

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.430
THE GANGES ENTERS A
VERY DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:44.000
THESE LOW LYING REGIONS
KNOWN AS THE GANGETIC PLAINS

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.260
ARE SOME OF THE
MOST PRODUCTIVE

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.060
AND DENSELY
POPULATED IN ASIA.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.200
THE LAND OWES ITS
FERTILITY TO THE GANGES

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.560
AS THE SILT CARRIED
IN THE RIVER'S FLOW

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:59.260
CREATES A RICH SOIL IN
WHICH CROPS FLOURISH.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.630
PRODUCING NEARLY HALF OF ALL
THE COUNTRY'S WHEAT AND RICE,

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:06.700
THESE FLOOD PLAINS ARE
THE BREAD BASKET OF INDIA.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.800
IT'S NO WONDER THAT THE
GANGES IS REVERED AS

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:25.660
THE RIVER OF CREATION
AND ABUNDANCE.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.960
IT'S THE RIVER'S NATURAL
FERTILITY THAT SUPPORTS

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.430
THE REGION'S EXCEPTIONALLY
HIGH BIRTH RATES

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:33.460
WHICH ARE SET TO
PROPEL INDIA'S POPULATION

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:38.160
TO AROUND 1.5 BILLION
PEOPLE BY 2030.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.400
BY THEN, INDIA WILL
HAVE OVERTAKEN CHINA

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.200
AS THE WORLD'S MOST
POPULOUS COUNTRY.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.900
BUT THE POPULATION GROWTH WHICH
THE GANGES HAS HELPED CREATE

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.100
IS NOW THREATENING
ITS VERY EXISTENCE

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.000
BECAUSE URBAN DEVELOPMENT
IS POISONING THE RIVER

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.230
AND THE PEOPLE
WHO DEPEND UPON IT.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:05.160
LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE GANGETIC PLAINS,

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.360
KANPUR IS THE FIRST
MEGA CITY ON THE GANGES.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.660
IT'S HOME TO OVER
FOUR MILLION PEOPLE

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.060
AND A BOOMING
LEATHER INDUSTRY.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.830
THE RICH FARMLANDS ALL
AROUND KANPUR HAVE THE

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.560
HIGHEST CONCENTRATION
OF LIVESTOCK IN INDIA,

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:26.660
MAKING THIS THE PERFECT PLACE
FOR LEATHER PRODUCTION.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:32.100
KANPUR'S 350 TANNERIES
SPECIALIZE IN PROCESSING HIDES

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.800
INTO HEAVY LEATHER IN
AN INDUSTRY WHICH YIELDS

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:40.260
375 MILLION
DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:45.030
BUT POOR PLANNING MEANS THERE'S
NO EFFECTIVE SYSTEM FOR DEALING

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:49.930
WITH THE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF
INDUSTRIAL WASTE PRODUCED.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.400
FOR THOSE WHO WORK AND LIVE
HERE THE SULFUROUS GASES

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.060
POURING FROM THE FACTORIES
ARE A SERIOUS HEALTH RISK.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:00.230
RATES OF RESPIRATORY
DISEASE IN THIS TOWN

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.830
ARE
EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:12.660
FOR THE RIVER THE EFFECTS
ARE JUST AS DEADLY.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.100
MOST OF THE BYPRODUCTS
FROM THE TANNING INDUSTRY

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.800
END UP IN THE GANGES.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.930
THOUGH IT IS MANDATORY THAT
TANNERIES HAVE THEIR OWN

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:30.160
EFFLUENT TREATMENT PLANTS,
AT LEAST HALF DO NOT.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.260
ALL MANNER OF WASTE FROM ANIMAL
CARCASSES TO TOXIC EFFLUENCE

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.000
LADEN WITH CARCINOGENIC
CHEMICALS POUR THROUGH

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.600
FOUR MAJOR DRAINS
DIRECTLY INTO THE RIVER.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:48.160
MADHAPUR IS A FISHING VILLAGE
A FEW KILOMETERS DOWNSTREAM

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.160
OF KANPUR'S
LEATHER INDUSTRY.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.160
THE RESIDENTS HERE DEPEND
DIRECTLY ON THE RIVER

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.260
FOR SUBSISTENCE.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:03.560
FISHING USED TO PROVIDE THIS
COMMUNITY WITH A GOOD LIVING,

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:08.530
AS KISHAM PALKASHYAB
RECALLS.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:13.000
TRANSLATOR: WE USED TO WATCH OUR
ELDERS HUNTING FOR FISH HERE

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.760
AND THEY HAD TO CARRY THEIR
CATCH IN BUFFALO CARTS.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.730
SUCH BIG FISH, LONG ONES
WEIGHING ABOUT 20 KILOS.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:27.930
PEOPLE COULDN'T EVEN
LIFT THEM SOMETIMES.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:33.530
THEN AS WE GREW UP THE AMOUNT
OF FISH GRADUALLY DECREASED.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:37.330
SOME FISH DON'T EVEN COME
HERE ANYMORE BECAUSE OF

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:41.360
THE BAD WATER THAT
FLOWS FROM KANPUR.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.900
SOMETIMES DEAD FISH
PILE UP ON THE RIVER BANK

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:50.060
AND THE
GANGES STINKS.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:54.660
>>TO MOST FISH THE POLLUTION
IN THIS WATER PROVES DEADLY.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:58.930
AMONG THE FEW SPECIES
HARDY ENOUGH TO SURVIVE

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.730
IS THE LOCAL
ROHU FISH.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:05.100
BUT WHEN CAUGHT, THEIR
FLESH IS SO LADEN WITH TOXINS

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.400
IT IS PRACTICALLY
INEDIBLE.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.800
TRANSLATOR: SOMETIMES WE
THINK, FINE, WE DON'T HAVE

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.860
ANYTHING ELSE TO EAT
SO WE'LL JUST COOK THIS.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:21.260

BAD AND MAKES THE CHILDREN SICK.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:26.030
>>THE PEOPLE OF MADHAPUR
KNOW ONLY TOO WELL

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.700
HOW POLLUTION IS
POISONING THE RIVER.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:34.800
BUT THEY CAN'T ESCAPE
ITS DEADLY EFFECTS.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:39.760
THEY DEPEND ON THESE
WATERS FOR THEIR SURVIVAL.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.760

OUT FISHING WE ONLY HAVE

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.500
THIS WATER TO DRINK.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.060
BUT WHEN YOU RAISE
YOUR HAND IT SMELLS FOUL

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.700
AND THERE'S ANIMAL
FAT FLOWING IN THERE.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.560
YOUR HANDS ARE STICKY FROM THE
WATER AND IT'S SO DISGUSTING.

GOD KNOWS WHAT THEY
DISCHARGE INTO THE RIVER.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.830

WHEN YOU RAISE
YOUR HAND LIKE THIS

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.460
YOU CAN SEE ANIMAL FAT
FLOATING IN THE WATER.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:13.100

POLLUTED THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

TO MAKE A LIVING
FROM FISHING ANYMORE.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:21.560
TO SURVIVE, PEOPLE LIKE KISHAM
HAVE TRIED FARMING INSTEAD.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.000
BUT EVEN THE LAND IS
POISONED BY THE RIVER WATER

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.030

FUTURE LOOKS INCREASINGLY GRIM

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:10.330
AS KANPUR'S INDUSTRIAL
DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES.

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:13.300
COMMERCIAL GROWTH
ATTRACTS TENS OF THOUSANDS

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.930
OF NEW RESIDENTS TO
THE CITY EVERY YEAR.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:21.800
BUT THIS MASS MIGRATION SIMPLY
MAKES THE PROBLEM WORSE.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.360
FOR THE POPULATION OF KANPUR

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:32.060
AROUND 360 MILLION
LITERS OF SEWAGE PER DAY.

STRUGGLE TO COPE AND VAST
AMOUNTS OF RAW SEWAGE

ARE DELIBERATELY
DISCHARGED INTO THE GANGES.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:48.200
THE RIVER HAS BECOME
A DEADLY THREAT

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.830
TO THE PEOPLE
WHO DEPEND ON IT.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.260
NOWHERE IS THE PROBLEM MORE
ACUTE THAN AT THE HOLY GHATS

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:09.160
WHERE THE LOCAL PEOPLE ATTEND
THEIR DAILY BATHING RITUALS.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.760
EVEN HERE THE GANGES IS
CONSIDERED TO BE HOLY

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.700
AND WASHING IN ITS
WATERS IS SUPPOSED TO

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.800
RID THE BODY OF POLLUTION.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.560

TRUE EXTENT OF KANPUR'S

EXPERIENCE OF THE DEADLY EFFECTS
OF POLLUTION ON PEOPLE'S HEALTH.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:06.230
TRANSLATOR: IF THE WATER IS
POLLUTED AND PEOPLE ARE

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.600

WORM INFESTATIONS
ARE WATER-BORNE.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.930

A WATER INFECTION.

SO, TOO, ARE
THE CHEMICALS.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.560

THESE CHEMICALS CANNOT
ONLY CAUSE CANCER,

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:02.660
THEY ALSO DESTROY THE
NUTRIENT CONTENT OF THE FOOD.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:07.830

DIET FOR THESE WOMEN.

FOR EXAMPLE, A NORMAL
HEMOGLOBIN LEVEL

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:23.200
WOULD BE
BETWEEN 11 AND 13.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.360
NOW IN INDIA AND IN THIS AREA WE
HAVE PROBLEMS OF MALNUTRITION

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:32.800
SO WE OFTEN GETS PATIENTS
WITH HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.760
OF ONE TO THREE MILLIGRAMS
AND BECAUSE OF THIS

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.460
THE CHILD'S
GROWTH IS AFFECTED.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:45.260

BUT NECESSARY
PRICE TO PAY.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.500
DOWNSTREAM, HOWEVER,
THERE ARE CITIES FOR WHOM

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.730
PILGRIMAGE IS CRUCIAL
TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY.

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:29.260
HERE, A POISONED GANGES
PRESENTS A MASSIVE PROBLEM.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.660
THE CITY OF ALLAHABAD SITS
AT ONE OF THE MOST SACRED

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.630
RIVER CONFLUENCES
IN INDIA.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:48.130
THIS IS WHERE THE HOLY GANGES
MEETS THE EARTHLY YAMUNA

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:51.960
AND THE MYTHICAL
SARASVATI RIVER.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.830
HINDU MYTHOLOGY SAYS THAT GODS
AND DEMONS FOUGHT A WAR HERE

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.930
OVER THE NECTAR
OF IMMORTALITY,

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:03.160

FESTIVAL PILGRIMS GATHER

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.100
TO VENERATE THE PLACE
WHERE THE NECTAR FELL

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.730
IN ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT EVENTS

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:13.960
IN THE RELIGIOUS
CALENDAR.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:21.560
IN THE COURSE OF THIS 45-DAY
FESTIVAL ALLAHABAD IS

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.560
TRANSFORMED AS SOME 70 MILLION
FAITHFUL DESCEND UPON IT

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:32.000
IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE LARGEST
GATHERING OF HUMANS EVER.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.660
THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENT OF ALL
IS THE ROYAL BATH WHEN PILGRIMS

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.060
RUSH TO THE WATERS' EDGE
TO PERFORM A UNIQUE

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:42.430
CLEANSING RITUAL
FOR MOTHER GANGA.

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:45.800
ACCORDING TO LEGEND,
WHEN THE GODDESS AGREED

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.430
TO LIBERATE MANKIND
FROM ITS SINS

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:53.700
SHE ASKED WHO WOULD
PURIFY HER AFTERWARDS.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:57.000
IT WAS DEEMED TO BE THE SADHUS
WHO, DURING THE KUMBH MELA,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.930
WOULD BATHE IN THE WATER,
ABSORBING THE RIVER'S SINS

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:05.230
AND PURIFYING HER
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:07.800
BEING FIRST IN THE RIVER
TO CLEANSE THE GODDESS

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.860
IS A MUCH SOUGHT
AFTER RIGHT

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:13.860
AND HAS BEEN THE CAUSE
OF STAMPEDES IN THE PAST.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:19.530
BUT IN 2007 THINGS TOOK A
VERY DIFFERENT TURN AS THE

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:24.830
MOST COMMITTED HOLY MEN
BOYCOTTED THE FESTIVAL.

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:28.760
DISGUSTED BY THE POLLUTION
AND ISLANDS OF RUBBISH

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.600
FLOATING IN THE RIVER,
THEY REFUSED TO BATHE

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.730
UNTIL THE AUTHORITIES
CLEANED UP THE WATERS.

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:38.930
SOME EVEN THREATENED
MASS SUICIDE.

00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:46.960
THESE PROTESTS MARKED A CRITICAL
JUNCTION IN THE RIVER'S STORY.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.200
EVEN THE SADHUS FELT THEY
COULD NO LONGER IGNORE

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.830
THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN
THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:57.160
AND THE PHYSICAL
STATE OF THE WATERS.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.530
SHOCKED BY THE SWELL
OF PUBLIC OPINION,

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.300
THE AUTHORITIES OPENED
UP AN UPSTREAM DAM

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.330
TO FLUSH POLLUTION AWAY
FROM THE MAIN GHATS.

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:08.400
IT WORKED.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.400
THE SADHUS WERE APPEASED
AND THE FESTIVAL WENT AHEAD.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:19.230
BUT IN THE MINDS OF THE PUBLIC A
NEW TRUTH HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:26.330
- THAT THE GANGES, THOUGH
HOLY, IS NOW LESS THAN PURE.

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:31.030
IT'S BECOMING CLEAR THAT DRASTIC
LONG TERM ACTION IS NEEDED TO

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:36.700
PREVENT THIS RIVER OF LIFE FROM
BECOMING THE RIVER OF DEATH.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.160
125 KILOMETERS
DOWNSTREAM FROM ALLAHABAD,

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.400
THE GANGES REACHES
THE CITY OF VARANASI.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.900
AT THIS HOLIEST OF SITES
THE RIVER IS FACING

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:00.700
ITS MOST DIRE CRISIS.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:10.900
VARANASI IS SAID TO BE
THE SPIRITUAL HOME OF

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:15.530
ALL 330 MILLION HINDU
GODS AND GODDESSES.

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:20.100
IT'S ALSO THE ONLY PLACE ON
ITS ENTIRE COURSE WHERE THE

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:25.630
RIVER RUNS NORTHWARD IN
THE DIRECTION OF ITS SOURCE.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:29.160
LEGEND HAS IT THAT THE GANGES
FELL SO IN LOVE WITH VARANASI

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.430
SHE NEARLY GAVE UP ON
HER SEAWARD JOURNEY

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:35.360
TO STAY IN THE CITY.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:41.630
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
PILGRIMAGE SITE IN INDIA.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.760
HINDUS BELIEVE THAT THOSE
WHO ARE CREMATED AND HAVE

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.430
THEIR ASHES THROWN TO
THE GANGES AT VARANASI

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:56.830
WILL RECEIVE
ETERNAL SALVATION.

00:36:56.830 --> 00:37:01.860
FOR THIS REASON SICK PEOPLE MAKE
A DESPERATE PILGRIMAGE FROM

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:08.700
ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY TO SPEND
THEIR LAST DAYS IN THIS CITY.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.960
LIVING IN THE MOST PRIMITIVE
CONDITIONS, THESE WOMEN HAVE

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:20.930
CHOSEN TO LEAVE THEIR FAMILIES
BEHIND AND FACE DEATH ALONE.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:27.730
SURENDRA PASAYAD ATTENDS TO THE
ILL AND DYING ON THE RIVERBANKS.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:32.300
TRANSLATOR: THE OLD PEOPLE
WHO COME TO VARANASI THINK

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:36.360
"IF I DETACH MYSELF FROM
MY FAMILY I WILL FIND GOD".

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:41.300
WHEN YOU SACRIFICE ONE
THING YOU RECEIVE ANOTHER

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:46.960
SO PEOPLE COME
HERE TO FIND GOD.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:51.730
>>IN RETURN FOR A SMALL PAYMENT
SURENDRA MAKES SURE THAT

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:56.400
THESE WOMEN RECEIVE FOOD
AND MEDICINES FOR THEIR PAINS.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:03.500
BUT TO HIM IT'S ABOUT
MORE THAN MONEY.

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:08.400
TRANSLATOR: HELPING THE OLD
PEOPLE GIVES ME MORE SPIRITUAL

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.900
FULFILLMENT THAN THE
ACT OF JUST PRAYING.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:16.560
I GET A GREATER REWARD
FROM SERVING THE OLD PEOPLE

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:20.960
THAN FROM
WORSHIP ALONE.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:28.060
THAT'S WHY I
DO THIS WORK.

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.560
>>NOT ONLY DOES SURENDRA
CARE FOR THE SICK,

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.900
HE LOOKS AFTER
THE DEAD, TOO.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.330
WHEN THESE WOMEN DIE,
SURENDRA WILL FULFILL THEIR

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:41.330
FINAL WISH BY MAKING SURE
THAT THEIR BODIES ARE

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:45.200
RITUALLY BURNED
ON THE RIVERBANK.

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.260
THE MAIN CREMATION
BUSINESS IS BASED HERE

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.300
AT THE
MANIKARNIKA GHAT,

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:04.630
THE HOLIEST OF ALL PLACES
IN THIS CITY OF HOLIES.

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:10.760
WORKING IN THIS DEATH FACTORY
IS A DIRTY AND DANGEROUS JOB.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:14.430
THOSE WHO KEEP THE FIRES BURNING
DAY AND NIGHT BELONG TO THE

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:19.260
SOCIAL GROUP, OR CASTE,
KNOWN AS THE "UNTOUCHABLES".

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:23.460
IN TRADITIONAL INDIAN SOCIETY,
UNTOUCHABLES ARE RECOGNIZED

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:27.800
AS HAVING THE LOWEST
STATUS OF ALL THE CASTES.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:32.100
BUT AT MANIKARNIKA THEY
COMMAND HUGE RESPECT.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:37.230
FOR RICH OR POOR,
HIGH OR LOW CASTE,

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:40.600
THE DECEASED AND THEIR FAMILIES
DEPEND ON THESE WORKERS

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:44.460
TO CARRY OUT A
PROPER HINDU FUNERAL.

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:59.900
PACKAGE DEALS ARE AVAILABLE
EVEN FOR THE DEAD.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:03.330
ALL THE WOOD, INCENSE, AND
MANPOWER NEEDED FOR A FULL

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:06.830
CREMATION CAN BE BOUGHT
FOR SOME 950 RUPEES.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:11.030
THAT'S ABOUT
20 DOLLARS.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:17.360
ONCE THE PRICE IS AGREED, THE
DEATH SERVANTS GO TO WORK.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.430
FIREWOOD IS
WEIGHED FOR THE PYRE

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:24.630
ONTO WHICH THE
BODY WILL BE PLACED.

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:30.300
THE CORPSE IS LIT FROM AN
ETERNAL FLAME WHICH IS

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:37.700
SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN
BURNING SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME.

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:41.030
MEANWHILE THE CHIEF MOURNER,
USUALLY THE ELDEST SON,

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:47.700
HAS HIS HEAD SHAVED AS
A SYMBOL OF HIS GRIEF.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:52.100
AFTER THE RITUAL PREPARATION,
THE MOURNER TAKES THE TWIGS

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.900
OF HOLY KUSA GRASS
FROM THE ETERNAL FIRE

00:40:54.900 --> 00:41:01.300
TO SET THE
PYRE ALIGHT.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:10.460
THE CORPSE BURNS AND THE FIRE
CONVEYS THE DECEASED TO HEAVEN.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:15.160
TO THE WIDER WORLD, THE PUBLIC
NATURE OF THIS CEREMONY

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:19.000
MAY SEEM MACABRE.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.030
BUT FOR HINDUS IT IS ONLY RIGHT
THAT THIS CELEBRATORY RITUAL

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:27.100
SHOULD HAPPEN
IN THE OPEN.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.000
FEW TEARS ARE SHED AS THE
MOURNERS WATCH THE SOULS

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.730
OF THEIR DEAD ASCENDING
TO THE AFTERLIFE.

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:38.800
TRANSLATOR: VARANASI
IS NOT A SAD PLACE.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.630
YOU CAN ATTAIN ALL
FORMS OF HAPPINESS HERE.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:44.160
THERE'S NO GREATER
PLEASURE THAN SALVATION,

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:48.260
SO VARANASI
ISN'T A SAD PLACE.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:53.900
>>AFTER THE CREMATION THE
ASHES ARE THROWN INTO THE RIVER

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:58.600
AND THE MOURNERS WALK
AWAY WITHOUT LOOKING BACK.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.300
THE FUNERAL WORKERS IN THE
MEANTIME RIFLE THROUGH THE

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:07.830
CHARCOAL IN SEARCH OF GOLD TEETH
AND OTHER PRECIOUS REMNANTS.

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:13.830
BUT IT'S NOT ONLY PEOPLE'S ASHES
THAT ARE THROWN TO THE RIVER.

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:21.630
PREGNANT WOMEN AND DEAD BABIES
ARE CONSIDERED DEVOID OF SIN.

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:27.230
THEY DON'T NEED TO BE
CLEANSED BY CREMATION

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:35.600
AND THEIR BODIES ARE FLOATED
DIRECTLY ON THE WATER.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.700
AT VARANASI, CORPSES
WRAPPED IN ORNATE SHROUDS

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:47.530
ARE OFTEN SEEN
FLOATING ALONG.

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:50.330
THE BEACH OPPOSITE
THE CITY IS ALSO LITTERED

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:53.130
WITH HUMAN REMAINS.

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:03.830
YET STILL, EVERY MORNING
HINDUS GATHER TO BATHE,

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:08.700
DRIVEN BY AN UNSHAKABLE
BELIEF IN THE RIVER'S PURITY.

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:13.330
ONE OF THEM IS
DOCTOR BADRA MISHRA.

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:17.960
DOCTOR MISHRA WAS ONLY 14 WHEN
HE BECAME THE SEVENTH PRIEST

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:25.100
IN HIS FAMILY, A POSITION PASSED
DOWN FROM FATHER TO SON.

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.000
HE'S ALSO A PROFESSOR OF
HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING AND IS

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.460
FULLY AWARE OF THE POLLUTION
WHICH PLAGUES THE RIVER.

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:35.200
YET FOR HIM, BATHING IN THESE
WATERS IS NOT A MATTER OF CHOICE

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.060
BUT A MATTER OF FAITH.

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:42.830
TRANSLATOR: THE RELIGIOUS TEXTS
SAY THAT VISITING THE GODDESS -

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:46.900
TOUCHING, WASHING, DRINKING
HER - CLEANSES OUR SINS.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:50.230
I WILL NOT BREAK FROM TRADITION
BUT I ALSO JUST CAN'T BELIEVE

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:53.030
THAT THERE IS NO POLLUTION
ENTERING THE GANGES.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.700
THERE CERTAINLY IS.

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:58.100
SO IN MY CASE THERE'S A
RATIONALLY TRAINED MIND

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:01.930
AS WELL AS A
COMMITTED HEART.

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:05.000
>>DOCTOR MISHRA BELIEVES
IT IS THE AUTHORITIES,

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.400
NOT THE PILGRIMS,
WHO ARE TO BLAME

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:12.200
FOR MOST OF THE
POLLUTION ON THE GANGES.

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:16.860
TRANSLATOR: SAYING THAT
IT'S ONLY THE PILGRIMS

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.900
THAT ARE MAKING THE
RIVER IMPURE AND DIRTY,

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:23.560
THIS BELIEF SHOULD
COME TO AN END.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:27.100
THE GANGES IS BEING HARMED
BY THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:31.060
OVERSEEING THE FUNCTIONING OF
THE CITIES AND THE FACTORIES

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:34.560
AND THOSE WHO ARE
DUMPING THE EFFLUENCE

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.400
OF THE MANY FACTORIES
INTO THE RIVER...

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:44.260
WHICH WE REFER TO AS POINT
SOURCES OF POLLUTION.

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:55.730
95% OF THE POLLUTION IS CAUSED
BY POINT SOURCES OF POLLUTION.

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:59.100
>>FRUSTRATED BY THE AUTHORITIES'
INDIFFERENCE, DOCTOR MISHRA

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:02.330
BEGAN HIS OWN GANGES CLEAN
UP CAMPAIGN AND ESTABLISHED

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:07.060
A RESEARCH LABORATORY TO
MONITOR POLLUTION LEVELS.

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:11.460
TODAY, KRUPEM DUBEI WORKS AT
THE LAB TESTING SAMPLES OF

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:14.860
RIVER WATER FOR A BACTERIUM
CALLED FECAL COLIFORM,

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:19.300
WHICH IS PRESENT
IN HUMAN SEWAGE.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:23.260
IF IT'S INGESTED, THIS ORGANISM
CAN CAUSE DEADLY ILLNESSES

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:27.360
SUCH AS TYPHOID
AND HEPATITIS.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:31.930
THE AMOUNT OF FECAL COLIFORM
PRESENT IN THE WATER

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:36.060
IS A PRIME INDICATOR OF THE
HEALTH HAZARD WHICH IT POSES.

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:41.000
THE TEST RESULTS AT
VARANASI ARE SHOCKING.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.230
TRANSLATOR: FOR
DRINKING WATER,

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:46.830
THE FECAL COLIFORM CONTENT
SHOULD BE 500 OR LESS.

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:49.560
THAT'S THE
PERMISSIBLE LIMIT.

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:54.960
OUR SAMPLES ARE TAKEN FIVE
METERS FROM THE RIVERBANK

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.030
BECAUSE THAT'S THE FURTHEST
POINT FROM THE BANK

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:00.960
THAT PEOPLE ARE
ABLE TO BATHE.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:06.700
THEY ALSO DRINK THE WATER FROM
THERE AND THE FECAL COLIFORM

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:13.160
COUNT IS FOUND TO BE
BETWEEN 40,000 TO 80,000.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:18.260
THE BIGGEST REASON
FOR THIS IS SEWAGE.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:22.100
>>TODAY, OVER A MILLION
LITERS OF SEWAGE

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:27.700
IS DUMPED INTO THE
GANGES EVERY SECOND.

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:33.530
AT VARANASI THE BIGGEST
PROBLEM IS POOR INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:37.030
WITH A POPULATION OF
MORE THAN THREE MILLION

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:40.630
THIS CITY SUFFERS
FREQUENT POWER SHORTAGES.

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:45.160
WITHOUT ELECTRICITY, THE PUMPS
WHICH OPERATE THE SEWAGE PLANTS

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:49.560
SHUT DOWN AND THE BACK FLOW
OF WASTE ENDS UP IN THE GANGES.

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:54.760
THE SCALE OF VARANASI'S
SEWAGE PROBLEM MEANS THAT

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:58.330
ORDINARY PEOPLE ARE
POWERLESS TO CHANGE IT.

00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:01.360
BUT DRIVEN BY AN INNATE
DESIRE TO HELP THE GANGES,

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.400
THEY DO WHAT THEY CAN.

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.400
EVERY MORNING THESE MEN
GATHER AT THE RIVERBANK

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:12.260
TO CLEAR THE POLLUTION
WITH THEIR BARE HANDS.

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:16.330
TRANSLATOR: GARLANDS,
FLOWERS, PLASTIC, CLOTHES -

00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:19.660
WE PICK THEM ALL UP AND
PUT THEM IN THE BOAT.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.700
WE TAKE THIS RUBBISH TO
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:25.930
WHERE THE DOGS AND
CROWS EAT IT ALL UP.

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:29.900
>>THEY ALSO PICK UP HUMAN
CORPSES AND CARCASSES

OF SACRED COWS OFTEN
FOUND FLOATING IN THE WATERS.

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:42.460

JUST A DROP IN THE OCEAN.

FEEL THERE SHOULDN'T BE

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.230
ANY POLLUTION.

WE TRY AND CLEAN UP BUT
THE POLLUTION CONTINUES.

HOW MUCH CAN
BE CLEANED?

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:54.900
THERE ARE JUST A
FEW OF US CLEANING

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.700
BUT GOD KNOWS HOW
MANY ARE POLLUTING.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.330
>>VARANASI MARKS A CRUCIAL
POINT IN THE GANGES' STORY.

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:14.900
IT'S HERE THAT THE SPIRITUAL
CYCLE OF LIFE AND DEATH

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:20.360
ASSOCIATED WITH THE
RIVER REACHES ITS CLIMAX.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:27.160
IT'S ALSO WHERE HARD SCIENCE IS
MOST AT ODDS WITH HINDU BELIEF.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:30.760
THE EVIDENCE PROVES THAT
THE GANGES AT VARANASI

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:35.900
IS ANYTHING BUT PURE.

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:38.230
MANY CLAIM THAT
THE PILGRIMS' FAITH

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:41.160
MAKES THEM BLIND
TO THE PROBLEMS.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:44.630
OTHERS BELIEVE THAT EVEN IF
PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT THE POLLUTION

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:48.100
THEY WOULD STILL FEEL
COMPELLED TO BATHE.

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:51.830
TRANSLATOR: FOR THEM, THE
GANGES IS THE MEDIUM OF LIFE.

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:54.630
JUST LIKE A FISH CANNOT
BE SEPARATED FROM WATER,

00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:59.500
THEY CANNOT BE SEPARATED
FROM THE GANGES.

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.460
>>WHAT'S MORE, DOCTOR
MISHRA IS CONVINCED THAT

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.160
THE PEOPLE BEST PLACED
TO PURIFY THE GANGES

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:09.200
ARE THE VERY PEOPLE
WHO BELIEVE IN HER PURITY.

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.660
TRANSLATOR: IF I SIT WITH
THE MASSES AND SAY THAT

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:16.330
THE GANGES HAS BECOME
DIRTY, IS POLLUTED,

00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:20.160
WITHIN A MINUTE OR TWO
SOMEONE WILL GET UP AND SAY,

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:24.330
"YOUR HOLINESS,
PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:27.760
IT'S UNBEARABLE.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:32.200
CAN THE MOTHER EVER
BE DIRTY OR POLLUTED?"

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.860
BUT WHEN YOU SHOW THEM
WHAT'S HAPPENING THEY SAY,

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:38.630
"NO, THE CITY'S SEWAGE
AND DRAINS SHOULD NOT BE

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:42.000
EMPTIED INTO THE RIVER.
THIS MUST STOP".

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.530
IF THIS LOVE AND RESPECT FOR
THE RIVER CAN BE HARNESSED

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:46.930
IT CAN BECOME
A GREAT POWER

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:50.400
WHICH CAN HELP US
IN SO MANY WAYS.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.660
>>IF THE POWER OF LOVE
CAN TRULY SAVE THIS RIVER

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:56.200
THEN THERE IS HOPE YET.

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.330
FOR NO RIVER ON EARTH
IS AS LOVED BY ITS PEOPLE

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:03.100
AS THE GANGES.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:07.800
PERHAPS 4,000 YEARS OF FAITH
IN THE PURITY OF THESE WATERS

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:12.560
WILL UNDO THE LAST
50 YEARS OF NEGLECT.

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:17.730
BUT POLLUTION IS JUST ONE OF
THE PROBLEMS TO BE FACED.

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:23.730
AS THE GLACIER WHICH FEEDS
THE RIVER CONTINUES TO RECEDE

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:26.030
THERE IS A REAL
DANGER THAT THE

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:30.100
SOURCE OF THE
GANGES WILL DISAPPEAR.

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:35.460
YET INDIA NEEDS THE RIVER
TODAY MORE THAN EVER.

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:38.730
AS THE POPULATION BOOM
CONTINUES, THE AMOUNT OF WATER

00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:43.330
AVAILABLE TO EACH PERSON
IS RAPIDLY DECREASING.

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:47.330
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT BY 2020
INDIA'S DEMAND FOR WATER

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:51.360
WILL EXCEED ALL
SOURCES OF SUPPLY.

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:55.660
DRASTIC CHANGE IS
NEEDED TO SAVE THE RIVER

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:59.800
AND PROTECT THE
FUTURE OF HER PEOPLE.

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:05.800
HOW THAT CAN BE DONE IS THE
CHALLENGE FACING INDIA TODAY.
