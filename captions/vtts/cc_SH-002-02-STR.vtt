00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.530


2
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.330
Now, my co-mates andbrothers in exile,

3
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.770
hath not old custom madethis life more sweet

4
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.370
than that of painted pomp?

5
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.570
Are not these woods morefree from peril

6
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.270
than the envious court?

7
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.400
Here feel we but thepenalty of Adam,

8
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.800
the seasons' difference,

9
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.070
as the icy fang andchurlish chiding of thewinter's wind,

10
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.100
which, when it bites andblows upon my body,

11
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.300
even till I shrink withcold,

12
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.870
I smile and say, "This isno flattery.

13
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.130
"These are counsellors

14
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.570
that feelingly persuade mewhat I am."

15
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.870
Sweet are the uses ofadversity,

16
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.330
which, like the toad, uglyand venomous,

17
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.400
wears yet a precious jewelin his head,

18
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.870
and this our life exemptfrom public haunt

19
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.200
finds tongues in trees,

20
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.270
books in the runningbrooks,

21
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.430
sermons in stones,

22
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.500
and good in every thing.

23
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.700
I would not change it.

24
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.930
Happy is your Grace

25
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.200
that can translate thestubbornness of fortune

26
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.370
into so quiet and so sweeta style.

27
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.630
Come, shall we go and killus venison?

28
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.530
And yet it irks me thepoor dappled fools,

29
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.370
being native burghers ofthis desert city,

30
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.600
should in their ownconfines with the forkedheads

31
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.130
have their round haunchesgored.

32
00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.400
Indeed, my lord,

33
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.330
the melancholy Jaquesgrieves at that,

34
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.670
and in that kind

35
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.800
swears you do more usurp

36
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.000
than doth your brotherthat hath banish'd you.

37
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.430
Today, my Lord of Amiensand myself

38
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.370
did steal behind him as helay along

39
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.300
under an oak whose antiqueroot peeps out

40
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.530
upon the brook that brawlsalong this wood,

41
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.130
to the which place a poorsequester'd stag

42
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.100
that from the hunter's aimhad ta'en a hurt

43
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.530
did come to languish,

44
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.800
and indeed, my lord,

45
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.970
the wretched animal heavedforth such groans

46
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.700
that their discharge didstretch his leathern coatalmost to bursting,

47
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.330
and the big round tears

48
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.430
coursed one another downhis innocent nose

49
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.670
in piteous chase;

50
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.570
and thus, the hairy fool

51
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.000
much marked of themelancholy Jaques,

52
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.470
stood on the extremestverge of the swift brook,

53
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.830
augmenting it with tears.

54
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.100
But what said Jaques?

55
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.400
Did he not moralize thisspectacle?

56
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.170
O, yes, into a thousandsimiles:

57
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.130
first, for his weepinginto the needless stream,

58
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.730
"Poor deer," quoth he,

59
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.130
"thou makest a testamentas worldlings do,

60
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.270
giving thy sum of more tothat which had too much";

61
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.100
then, being there alone,

62
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.000
left and abandon'd of hisvelvet friends,

63
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.370
"'Tis right," quoth he,

64
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.870
"thus misery doth part theflux of company"

65
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.600
anon a careless herd fullof the pasture,

66
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.830
jumps along by him andnever stays to greet him;

67
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.470
"Aye," quoth Jaques,"Sweep on, you fat andgreasy citizens;

68
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.700
"'tis just the fashion.

69
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.800
"Wherefore do you look

70
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.570
upon that poor and brokenbankrupt there?"

71
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.400
Thus most invectively,

72
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.970
he pierceth through thebody of the country, city,court,

73
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.770
yea, and of this, ourlife,

74
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.900
swearing that we are mereusurpers, tyrants,

75
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.170
and what's worse,

76
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.070
to fright the animals andto kill them up

77
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.100
in their assign'd andnative dwelling place.

78
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.670
And did you leave him inthis contemplation?

79
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.870
We did, my lord,

80
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.100
weeping and commentingupon the sobbing deer.

81
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.670
Show me the place.

82
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.830
I love to cope him inthese sullen fits,

83
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.670
for then he's full ofmatter.

84
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.730
Can it be possible that noman saw them?

85
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.130
It cannot be.

86
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.870
Some villains of my court

87
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.370
are of consent andsufferance in this.

88
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.100
I cannot hear of any thatdid see her.

89
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.700
The ladies, her attendantsof her chamber, saw herabed,

90
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.970
and in the morning early,

91
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.300
they found the beduntreasured of theirmistress.

92
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.600
My lord, the roynishclown,

93
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.630
at whom so oft your gracewas wont to laugh,

94
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.870
is also missing.

95
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.730
Hisperia, the princess'gentlewoman,

96
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.600
confesses that shesecretly o'erheard

97
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.970
your daughter and hercousin

98
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.270
much commend the parts andgraces of the wrestler

99
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.630
that did but lately foilthe sinewy Charles;

100
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.600
and she believes, whereverthey are gone,

101
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.970
that youth is surely intheir company.

102
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.470
Send to his brother.

103
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.830
Fetch that gallant hither.

104
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.770
I'll make him find him.

105
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.730
Do this expediently!

106
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.400
And let not search andinquisition

107
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.130
quail to bring again thesefoolish runaways.

108
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.300
Who's there?

109
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.700
What? My young master?

110
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.430
O, my gentle master,

111
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.830
your praise is come tooswiftly home before you.

112
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.030
Know you not, master, tosome kind of men

113
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.000
their graces serve thembut as enemies?

114
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.130
No more do yours.

115
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.830
Your virtues, gentlemaster,

116
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.630
are sanctified and holytraitors to you.

117
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.070
O, what a world is this

118
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.930
when what is comelyenvenoms him that bearsit?

119
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.400
Why, what's the matter?

120
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.400
O unhappy youth, come notwithin these doors.

121
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.870
Within this roof, theenemy of all your graceslives.

122
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.730
Your brother--no, nobrother-- yet the son--yetnot the son--

123
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.430
I will not call him son ofhim I was about to callhis father--

124
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.630
hath heard your praises,

125
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.900
and this night,

126
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.100
he means to burn thelodging where you use tolie

127
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.270
and you within it.

128
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.400
If he fail in that,

129
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.000
he hath other means to cutyou off.

130
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.700
I overheard him and hispractises.

131
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.100
This is no place.

132
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.670
This house is but abutchery.

133
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.900
Abhor it; fear it; do notenter it.

134
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.970
Why, whither, Adam,wouldst thou have me go?

135
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.200
No matter whither so youcome not here.

136
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.370
What, wouldst thou have mego and beg my food?

137
00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.030
Or with a base andboisterous sword

138
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.230
enforce a thievish livingon the common road?

139
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.900
Oh, but do not so.

140
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.670
I have 500 crowns,

141
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.870
the thrifty hire I savedunder your father,

142
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.770
which I did store to be myfoster nurse

143
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.930
when service should in myold limbs lie lame

144
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.600
and unregarded age incorners thrown.

145
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.100
Take that,

146
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.370
and he that doth theravens feed,

147
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.170
yea, providently catersfor the sparrow,

148
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.400
be comfort to my age.

149
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.600
Here is the gold.

150
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.900
All this I give you.

151
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.530
Let me be your servant.

152
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.400
Though I look old, yet Iam strong and lusty.

153
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.300
I'll do the service of ayounger man

154
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.570
in all your business andnecessities.

155
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.600
O good old man,

156
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.870
how well in thee appears

157
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.100
the constant service ofthe antique world,

158
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.330
when service sweat forduty, not for meed!

159
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.700
But, poor old man,

160
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.730
thou prunest a rotten treethat cannot so much as ablossom

161
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.730
yield in lieu of all thypains and husbandry,

162
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.300
but come thy ways.

163
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.830
We'll go along together.

164
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.700
Master, go on,

165
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.830
and I will follow thee tothe last gasp

166
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.700
with truth and loyalty.

167
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.030
From 17 years till nowalmost fourscore herelived I

168
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.970
but now live here no more.

169
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.700
At 17 years, many theirfortunes seek,

170
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.770
but at fourscore, it istoo late a week.

171
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.700
Yet fortune cannotrecompense me better

172
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:30.070
than to die well and notmy master's debtor.

173
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.030
O Jupiter, how weary aremy spirits.

174
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:55.000
I care not for my spiritsif my legs were not weary.

175
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.830
I could find it in myheart to disgrace my man'sapparel

176
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.130
and cry like a woman,

177
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.570
but I must comfort theweaker vessel

178
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:04.870
as doublet and hose

179
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.800
ought to show itself morecourageous to petticoat.

180
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.670
Therefore courage, goodAliena!

181
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:11.930
Pray you, bear with me.

182
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.570
I cannot go no further.

183
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:14.730
For my part,

184
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.100
I'd rather bear with youthan bear you,

185
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.570
yet I should bear no crossif I did bear you,

186
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.530
for I think you have nomoney in your purse.

187
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.330
Well...

188
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.800
this is the forest ofArden.

189
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.970
Aye, now am I in Arden,themore fool I.

190
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.830
When I was at home, I wasin a better place,

191
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.870
but travellers must becontent.

192
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.800
Aye, be so, goodTouchstone.

193
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.200
Look you, who comes here--

194
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.330
a young man and an old insolemn talk.

195
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.230
That is the way to makeher scorn you still.

196
00:08:54.730 --> 00:09:00.100
O Corin, that thou knew'sthow I do love her.

197
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.030
I partly guess, for I haveloved ere now.

198
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:09.070
No, Corin, being old, thoucanst not guess,

199
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.400
though in thy youth

200
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.770
thou wast as true a lover

201
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.530
as ever sigh'd upon amidnight pillow.

202
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.370
But if your love were everlike to mine--

203
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.330
as sure I think did neverman love so--

204
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.700
how many actions mostridiculous

205
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.670
hast thou been drawn to bythy fantasy?

206
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:37.030
Into a thousand that Ihave forgotten.

207
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:41.670
O, thou didst then neverlove so heartily.

208
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.600
If thou remember'st notthe slightest folly

209
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.370
that ever love did makethee run into,

210
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.200
thou hast not loved.

211
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.400
Or if thou hast not sat asI do now,

212
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.470
wearying thy hearer in thymistress' praise,

213
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.330
thou hast not loved.

214
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.900
Or if thou hast not brokefrom company abruptly

215
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.500
as my passion now makesme,

216
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.330
thou hast not loved.

217
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:13.570
O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!

218
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.670
Alas, poor shepherd.

219
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.230
Searching of thy wound,

220
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:25.700
I have by hard adventurefound mine own.

221
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.470
And I mine.

222
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.530
I remember, when I was inlove,

223
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.500
I broke my sword upon astone and bid him takethat

224
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.470
for coming a-night to JaneSmile;

225
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.500
and I remember the kissingof her batlet

226
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.970
and the cow's dugs

227
00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:42.970
that her pretty chopp'dhands had milked;

228
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.770
and I remember the wooingof a peascod instead ofher,

229
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.030
from whom I took two codsand, giving her themagain,

230
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:53.800
said with weeping tears,"Wear these for my sake."

231
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.770
Ah, we that are truelovers run into strangecapers;

232
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.100
but as all is mortal innature,

233
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.570
so is all nature in lovemortal in folly.

234
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:06.830
Thou speakest wiser thanthou art ware of.

235
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.730
Nay, I shall ne'er be wareof mine own wit

236
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.070
till I break my shinsagainst it.

237
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.400
Oh, Jove, Jove,

238
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.630
this shepherd's passion ismuch after my own fashion.

239
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:18.870
And mine,

240
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.930
but it grows somethingstale with me.

241
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.330
I pray you,

242
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.430
one of you question yondman

243
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.200
if he for gold will giveus any food.

244
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.700
I faint almost to death.

245
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.970
Holla, you clown!

246
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.130
Peace, fool.

247
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.570
He's not thy kinsman.

248
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:35.770
Who calls?

249
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.270
Your betters, sir.

250
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.000
Else are they verywretched.

251
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.070
Peace, I say.

252
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.100
Good even to you, friend.

253
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.330
And to you, gentle sir,

254
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:52.670
and to you all.

255
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.800
I prithee, shepherd,

256
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.870
if that love or gold

257
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.330
could in this desert placebuy entertainment,

258
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.100
bring us where we may restourselves and feed.

259
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.800
Here's a maid with travelmuch oppress'd

260
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.800
and almost faints forsuccor.

261
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.100
Fair sir,

262
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.100
I pity her and wish forher sake more than formine own

263
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.470
mine fortunes were moreable to relieve her,

264
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.700
but I am shepherd toanother man

265
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.300
and do not shear thefleeces that I graze.

266
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.970
My master is of churlishdisposition

267
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.130
and little reaks to findthe way to heaven

268
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.070
by doing deeds ofhospitality.

269
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:35.630
Besides, his cote, hisflocks, and bounds of feed

270
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.070
are now on sale,

271
00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.330
and at our sheepcote now,

272
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.100
by reason of his absence,

273
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.200
there is nothing that youwill feed on;

274
00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.500
but what is, come see;

275
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.500
and in my voice, mostwelcome shall you be.

276
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.800
What is he shall buy theflock and pasture?

277
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.570
That young swain that yousaw here but erewhile,

278
00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.030
that little cares forbuying any thing.

279
00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.570
I pray thee, if it standwith honesty,

280
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.800
buy thou the cottage,pasture, and the flock,

281
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.570
and thou shalt have to payfor it of us.

282
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.270
And we will mend thywages.

283
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.030
I like this place

284
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.230
and willingly could wastemy time in it.

285
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.830
Assuredly, the thing is tobe sold.

286
00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.200
Go with me.

287
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.130
If you like upon reportthe soil, the profit,

288
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.230
and this way of life,

289
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.870
I will your very faithfulfeeder be

290
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.770
and buy it with your goldright suddenly.

291
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.630
Under the greenwood tree

292
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.500
who loves to lie with me

293
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.900
and turn his merry note

294
00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.670
unto the sweet bird'sthroat.

295
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.500
Come hither, come hither,come hither.

296
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.230
Here shall he see no enemy

297
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:54.900
but winter and roughweather.

298
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:02.630
More, more, I prithee,more.

299
00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.130
It will make youmelancholy, MonsieurJaques.

300
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.000
I thank it.

301
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.130
More, I prithee, more.

302
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.100
I can suck melancholy outof a song

303
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.830
as a weasel sucks eggs.

304
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.730
More, I prithee, more.

305
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.030
My voice is ragged.

306
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.600
I know I cannot pleaseyou.

307
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.300
I do not desire you toplease me;

308
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.470
I do desire you to sing.

309
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:27.500
Come, more; anotherstanzo.

310
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.730
Call you 'em stanzos?

311
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.230
What you will, MonsieurJaques.

312
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.170
Nay, I care not for theirnames.

313
00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.670
They owe me nothing.

314
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.070
Will you sing?

315
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.500
More at your request thanto please myself.

316
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.100
Well then, if ever I thankany man,

317
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.300
I'll thank you.

318
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.500
Come, sing,

319
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.470
and you that will not,holdyour tongues.

320
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.970
Well, I'll end the song.

321
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.370
Sirs, cover the while.

322
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.700
The duke will drink underthis tree.

323
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.130
He hath been all this dayto look you.

324
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.800
And I have been all thisday to avoid him.

325
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.770
He is too disputable formy company.

326
00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:01.500
I think of as many mattersas he,

327
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.100
but I give heaven thanksand make no boast of them.

328
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.300
Come, warble, come.

329
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:13.170
Who doth ambition shun

330
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.770
and loves to live i' thesun,

331
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.400
seeking the food he eats

332
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.230
and pleased with what hegets?

333
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.170
Come hither, come hither,come hither.

334
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.570
Here shall he see no enemy

335
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:30.730
but winter and roughweather.

336
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.100
I'll give you a verse

337
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.000
to this note that I madeyesterday

338
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.730
in despite of myinvention.

339
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.400
And I'll sing it.

340
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.030
Thus it goes:

341
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:45.030
If it do come to pass

342
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:49.100
that any man turn ass,

343
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.870
leaving his wealth andease,

344
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.030
a stubborn will toplease--

345
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:58.200
ducdame, ducdame,ducdame--

346
00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.600
there shall he see grossfools as he,

347
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.500
and if he will, come tome.

348
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.800
What's that "ducdame"?

349
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:17.470
'Tis a Greek invocation tocall fools into a circle.

350
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.170
Oh, I'll go sleep if Ican.

351
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.030
If I cannot,

352
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:28.970
I'll rail against all thefirst-born of Egypt.

353
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.500
If it do come to pass

354
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.070
that any man turn ass,

355
00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.900
leaving his wealth andease,

356
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.730
a stubborn will toplease--

357
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.600
ducdame, ducdame,ducdame--

358
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.130
here shall he see grossfools as he,

359
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:52.430
and if he will, come tome.

360
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:16.670
Dear master, I can go nofurther.

361
00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.330
O, I die for food.

362
00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:25.670
Here lie I down andmeasure out my grave.

363
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:30.030
Farewell, kind master.

364
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.530
How now, Adam.

365
00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.100
No greater heart in thee?

366
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.870
Live a little; comfort alittle; cheer thyself alittle.

367
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.100
If this uncouth forestyield any thing savage,

368
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.800
I will either be food forit or bring it for food tothee.

369
00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.500
For my sake, becomfortable.

370
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.700
Hold death awhile at thearm's end.

371
00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.370
I will here be with theepresently,

372
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.230
and if I bring thee notsomething to eat,

373
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.630
I will give thee leave todie.

374
00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.500
But if thou diest before Icome, thou art a mocker ofmy labour.

375
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.200
Well said.

376
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.900
Thou lookest cheerly,

377
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.270
and I will be with theequickly.

378
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:13.070
Yet thou liest in thebleak air.

379
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:17.130
Come, I will bear thee tosome shelter,

380
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.130
and thou shalt not die forlack of a dinner

381
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.030
if there live any thing inthis desert.

382
00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.370
Cheerly, good Adam.

383
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.870
I think he be transform'dinto a beast,

384
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.670
for I can no where findhim like a man.

385
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.530
My lord, he is but evennow gone hence.

386
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.270
Here was he merry, hearingof a song.

387
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.700
If he, compact of jars,grows musical,

388
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.900
we shall have shortlydiscord in the spheres.

389
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.000
How now, monsieur.

390
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.770
What a life is this,

391
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.630
that your poor friendsmust woo your company?

392
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:57.300
What?

393
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.870
You look merrily.

394
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.800
A fool, a fool.

395
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.170
I met a fool in theforest,

396
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.400
a motley fool.

397
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.630
Oh, a miserable world.

398
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.400
As I do live by food,

399
00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.400
I met a fool who laid himdown and bask'd him inthe sun

400
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.270
and rail'd on Lady Fortunein good terms,

401
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.870
in good set terms,

402
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.930
and yet a motley fool.

403
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.670
"Good morrow, fool," quothI.

404
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.700
"No, sir," quoth he.

405
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.970
"Call me not fool tillheaven hath sent mefortune,"

406
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.870
and then he drew a dialfrom his poke,

407
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.170
and, looking on it withlackluster eye,

408
00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:45.400
says very wisely, "It isten o'clock.

409
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.870
Thus we may see," quothhe, "how the world wags.

410
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.000
"'Tis but an hour agosince it was nine,

411
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.100
"and after one hour more'twill be eleven,

412
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.730
"and so from hour to hour,we ripe and ripe,

413
00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:02.370
"and then from hour tohour, we rot and rot,

414
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.330
and thereby hangs a tale."

415
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.200
But when I did hear themotley fool

416
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.870
thus moral on the time,

417
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.500
my lungs began to crowlike chanticleer

418
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.370
that fools should be sodeep-contemplative,

419
00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:18.970
and I did laugh sansintermission

420
00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:21.570
an hour by his dial.

421
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.830
O noble fool.

422
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.800
A worthy fool.

423
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.130
Motley's the only wear.

424
00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:29.500
What fool is this?

425
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.800
A worthy fool, one thathath been a courtier,

426
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.930
and says if ladies be butyoung and fair,

427
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.130
they have the gift toknow it.

428
00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.730
And in his brain,

429
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:43.170
which is as dry as theremainder biscuit

430
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:44.330
after a voyage,

431
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:48.400
he hath strange placescramm'd with observation

432
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.500
the which he vents inmangled forms.

433
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.970
O that I were a fool.

434
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.400
I am ambitious for amotley coat.

435
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.670
Thou shalt have one.

436
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.470
It is my only suit,

437
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:07.370
I must have libertywithal, as large a charteras the wind,

438
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:09.830
to blow on whom I please,

439
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.500
for so fools have.

440
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.100
Invest me in my motley.

441
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.270
Give me leave to speak mymind,

442
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.800
and I will, through andthrough,

443
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.770
cleanse the foul body ofthe infected world

444
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:24.400
if they will patientlyreceive my medicine.

445
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.600
Fie on thee.

446
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.230
I can tell thee what thouwouldst do.

447
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:31.030
What, for a counter, wouldI do but good?

448
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:35.800
Most mischievous foul sinin chiding sin,

449
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:40.430
for thou thyself hast beena libertine

450
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.500
as sensual as the brutishsting itself,

451
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.270
and all the embossed soresand headed evils

452
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:49.900
which thou with licence offree foot hast caught

453
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.730
wouldst thou disgorge intothe general world.

454
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.600
Why, who cries out onpride

455
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.800
that can therein tax anyprivate party?

456
00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.370
Doth it not flow as hugelyas the sea

457
00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:03.400
till that the wearer'svery means do ebb?

458
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.030
What woman in the city doI name

459
00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:08.030
when that I say the citywoman bears the cost ofprinces

460
00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.230
on unworthy shoulders?

461
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.770
Who can come in and saythat I mean her

462
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.570
when such a one as shesuch is her neighbour?

463
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:17.030
Or what is he of basestfunction

464
00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.830
that says his bravery isnot of my cost

465
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.230
thinking that I mean him

466
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:24.670
but therein suits hisfolly to the mettle of myspeech?

467
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.130
There then;

468
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:27.400
how then?

469
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.630
What then?

470
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:31.530
Let me see wherein mytongue hath wrong'd him.

471
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.270
If it do him right, thenhe hath wrong'd himself.

472
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.700
If he be free,

473
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.600
why then my taxing, like awild goose, flies,

474
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.900
unclaim'd of any man.

475
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.970
Forbear, and eat no more!

476
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:44.300
Why, I have eat none yet.

477
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.570
Nor shalt not tillnecessity be served.

478
00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.470
Of what kind should thiscock come of?

479
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.600
Art thou thus bolden'd,man, by thy distress

480
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.170
or else a rude despiser ofgood manners

481
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.670
that in civility thouseem'st so empty?

482
00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.170
You touch'd my vein atfirst.

483
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.870
The thorny point of baredistress

484
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.200
hath ta'en from me theshow of smooth civility.

485
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.770
Yet, am I inland bred andknow some nurture.

486
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.400
But forbear, I say.

487
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.570
He dies that touches anyof this fruit

488
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.430
till I and my affairs areanswered.

489
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.500
And you will not beanswered with reason, Imust die.

490
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.600
What wouldst thou have?

491
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.770
Thy gentleness shall force

492
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.530
more than your force moveus to gentleness.

493
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.730
I almost die for food, andlet me have it!

494
00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:30.300
Sit down and feed, andwelcome to our table.

495
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.930
Speak you so gently?

496
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.400
Pardon me, I pray you.

497
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.530
I thought that all thingshad been savage here

498
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:38.770
and therefore put I on

499
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.630
the countenance of sterncommandment.

500
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:44.470
But whate'er you are thatin this desert inaccessible

501
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.270
under the shade ofmelancholy boughs

502
00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.770
lose and neglect thecreeping hours of time,

503
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:51.200
if ever you have look'd onbetter days,

504
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.600
if ever been where bellshave knoll'd to church,

505
00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.270
if ever sat at any goodman's feast,

506
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.170
if ever from your eyelidswiped a tear

507
00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:01.000
and know what 'tis to pityand be pitied,

508
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.700
let gentleness my strongenforcement be.

509
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:09.170
In the which hope I blushand hide my sword.

510
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:13.200
True is it that we haveseen better days,

511
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.370
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

512
00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.770
Therefore, sit you down ingentleness

513
00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:19.900
and take upon command whathelp we have

514
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.800
that to your wanting maybe minister'd.

515
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.870
Then but forbear your fooda little while

516
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.770
whiles, like a doe, I goto find my fawn and giveit food.

517
00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:28.270
There is an old poor man

518
00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.770
who after me hath many aweary step limp'd in purelove.

519
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.100
Till he be first sufficed,

520
00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.330
oppress'd with two weakevils, age and hunger,

521
00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:35.530
I will not touch a bit.

522
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.000
Go find him out,

523
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.030
and we will nothing wastetill you return.

524
00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:40.630
I thank ye,

525
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.130
and be blessed for yourgood comfort.

526
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:51.100
Thou seest we are not allalone unhappy.

527
00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:55.200
This wide and universaltheater presents morewoeful pageants

528
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.970
than the scene wherein weplay in.

529
00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:00.400
All the world's a stage

530
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.330
and all the men and womenmerely players.

531
00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:07.530
They have their exits andtheir entrances,

532
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:11.330
and one man in his timeplays many parts,

533
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.530
his acts being seven ages:

534
00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.230
at first the infant,

535
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:20.270
mewling and puking in thenurse's arms;

536
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:21.870
and then the whiningschoolboy

537
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.230
with his satchel andshining morning face,

538
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:28.270
creeping like snailunwillingly to school;

539
00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:31.370
and then the lover,sighing like furnace,

540
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:36.100
with a woeful ballad madeto his mistress' eyebrow;

541
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.670
then a soldier,

542
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.300
full of strange oaths andbearded like the pard,

543
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.130
jealous in honor, suddenand quick in quarrel,

544
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:49.030
seeking the bubblereputation even in thecannon's mouth;

545
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.570
and then the justice,

546
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:54.870
in fair round belly withgood capon lined,

547
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:58.770
with eyes severe and beardof formal cut,

548
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:04.170
full of wise saws andmodern instances,

549
00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.400
and so he plays his part.

550
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.770
The sixth age shifts

551
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.300
into the lean andslipper'd pantaloon,

552
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:17.600
with spectacles on noseand pouch on side,

553
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.670
his youthful hose,well-saved,

554
00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:25.600
the world too wide for hisshrunk shank,

555
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.830
and his big, manly voice

556
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.970
turning again towardchildish treble,

557
00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:37.030
pipes and whistles in hissound.

558
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.230
Last scene of all

559
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:45.800
that ends this strange,eventful history,

560
00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.100
is second childishness

561
00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.570
and mere oblivion,

562
00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.600
sans teeth,

563
00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.530
sans eyes,

564
00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:01.630
sans taste,

565
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.830
sans everything.

566
00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:15.700
Set down your venerableburden.

567
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.370
And let him feed.

568
00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.300
I thank you most for him.

569
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.130
So had you need.

570
00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:34.130
I scarce can speak tothank you for myself.

571
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.800
Welcome; fall to.

572
00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:43.370
I will not trouble you asyet

573
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:47.230
to question you about yourfortunes.

574
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:49.370
Give us some music,

575
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.300
and, good cousin, sing.

576
00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:03.500
Blow, blow, thou winterwind.

577
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:07.830
Thou art not so unkind

578
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:11.500
as man's ingratitude.

579
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:16.730
Thy tooth is not so keen

580
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:21.430
because thou art not seen,

581
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.130
although thy breath berude.

582
00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:26.330
Heigh-ho.

583
00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.530
Sing, heigh-ho

584
00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:34.270
unto the green holly.

585
00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:39.600
Most friendship isfeigning.

586
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:44.930
Most loving, mere folly.

587
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.330
Then, heigh-ho, the holly,

588
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:53.670
this life is most jolly.

589
00:28:55.430 --> 00:29:00.700
Freeze, freeze, thoubitter sky,

590
00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:05.230
that dost not bite so nigh

591
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:08.570
as benefits forgot.

592
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:13.930
Though thou the waterswarp,

593
00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:18.370
thy sting is not so sharp

594
00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:21.430
as friend remember'd not.

595
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:23.600
Heigh-ho.

596
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.870
Sing, heigh-ho

597
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:31.370
unto the green holly.

598
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:36.600
Most friendship isfeigning.

599
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:41.730
Most loving, mere folly.

600
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:45.130
Then, heigh-ho, the holly,

601
00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:51.870
this life is most jolly.

602
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.000
