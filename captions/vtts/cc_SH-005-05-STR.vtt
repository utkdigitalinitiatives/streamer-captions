00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.830
(applause and cheering)

3
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.400
My very worthy cousin,fairly met!

4
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.330
Happy return be to yourroyal grace!

5
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.470

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.930
Happy return be to yourroyal grace!

8
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.570
Many and hearty thankingsto you both.

9
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.370
We have made inquiry ofyou;

10
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.900
and we hear such goodnessof your justice,

11
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.900
that our soul

12
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.730
Cannot but yield you forthto public thanks,

13
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.830
Forerunning more requital.

14
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.730
You make my bonds stillgreater.

15
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.970
O, your desert speaksloud;

16
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.970
and I should wrong it,

17
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.700
To lock it in the wards ofcovert bosom,

18
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.300
When it deserves, withcharacters of brass,

19
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.870
A forted residence 'gainstthe tooth of time

20
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.170
And razure of oblivion.Give me your hand,

21
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.030
And let the subject see,to make them know

22
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.530
That outward courtesieswould fain proclaim

23
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.430
Favours that keep within.

24
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.330
Escalus, come!

25
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.030
You must walk by us on ourother hand;

26
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.670
And good supporters areyou.

27
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.200
Now is your time: speakloud and kneel before him.

28
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.800
Justice, O royal duke!

29
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.730
Vail your regard

30
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.600
Upon a wrong'd,

31
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.670
I would fain have said, amaid!

32
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.800
O worthy prince, dishonournot your eye

33
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.630
By throwing it on anyother object

34
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.700
Till you have heard me inmy true complaint

35
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.630
And given me justice,justice, justice, justice!

36
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.000
Relate your wrongs; inwhat? by whom? be brief.

37
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.470
Here is Lord Angelo shallgive you justice:

38
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.570
Reveal yourself to him.

39
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.500
O worthy prince,

40
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.270
You bid me seek redemptionof the devil:

41
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.400
Hear me yourself; for thatwhich I must speak

42
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.030
Must either punish me, notbeing believed,

43
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.870
Or wring redress from you.

44
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.600
Hear me, O hear me, here!

45
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.370
My lord, her wits, I fearme, are not firm:

46
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.330
She hath been a suitor tome for her brother

47
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.300
Cut off by course ofjustice

48
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.370
By course of justice!

49
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.870
And she will speak mostbitterly and strange.

50
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.670
Most strange, and yet mosttruly, will I speak:

51
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.670
That Angelo's forsworn; isit not strange?

52
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.630
That Angelo's a murderer;is 't not strange?

53
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.370
That Angelo is anadulterous thief,

54
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.600
An hypocrite, avirgin-violator;

55
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.730
Is it not strange andstrange?

56
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.730
Nay, it is ten timesstrange.

57
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.070
It is not truer he isAngelo

58
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.300
Than this is all as trueas it is strange:

59
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.870
Nay, it is ten times true;

60
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.370
for truth is truth to theend of reckoning.

61
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.500
Away with her!

62
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.800
Poor soul, She speaks thisin the infirmity of sense.

63
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.130
O prince, I conjure thee,

64
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.000
as thou believest

65
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.070
There is another comfortthan this world,

66
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.400
That thou dismiss me not,with that opinion

67
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.130
That I am touch'd withmadness!

68
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.600
Make not impossible

69
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.770
That which but seemsunlike:

70
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.900
'tis not impossible

71
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.300
But one, the wicked'stcaitiff on the ground,

72
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.670
May seem as shy, as grave,as just, as absolute

73
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.330
As Angelo; even so mayAngelo,

74
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.170
In all his dressings,characts, titles, forms,

75
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.200
Be an arch-villain;believe it, royal prince:

76
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.000
If he be less, he'snothing; but he's more,

77
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.300
Had I more name forbadness.

78
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.230
By mine honesty,

79
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.200
If she be mad,--as Ibelieve no other,--

80
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.000
Her madness hath theoddest frame of sense,

81
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.330
Such a dependency of thingon thing,

82
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.100
As e'er I heard inmadness.

83
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.730
O gracious duke,

84
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.500
Harp not on that,

85
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.200
nor do not banish reasonfor inequality;

86
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.770
but let your reason serve

87
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.530
To make the truth appearwhere it seems hid,

88
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.530
And hide the false seemstrue.

89
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.170
Many that are not mad

90
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.800
Have, sure, more lack ofreason.

91
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.670
What would you say?

92
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.400
I am the sister of oneClaudio,

93
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.430
Condemn'd upon the act offornication

94
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.570
To lose his head;condemn'd by Angelo:

95
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.000
I, in probation of asisterhood,

96
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.100
Was sent to by my brother;one Lucio

97
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.570
As then the messenger

98
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.200
That's I, an't like yourgrace:

99
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.170
I came to her fromClaudio, and desired her

100
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.900
To try her graciousfortune with Lord Angelo

101
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.700
For her poor brother'spardon.

102
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.700
That's he indeed.

103
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.800
You were not bid to speak.

104
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.670
No, my good lord;

105
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.570
Nor wish'd to hold mypeace.

106
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.730
I pray you now, then;

107
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.000
Pray you, take note of it:

108
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.670
and when you have abusiness for yourself,

109
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.070
pray heaven you then beperfect.

110
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.670
I warrant your honour.

111
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.500
The warrants for yourself;take heed to't.

112
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.570
This gentleman toldsomewhat of my tale

113
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.470
Right.

114
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.100
It may be right; but youare i' the wrong

115
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.830
To speak before your time.Proceed.

116
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.170
I went to this perniciouscaitiff deputy

117
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.070
That's somewhat madlyspoken.

118
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.770
Pardon it;

119
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.230
The phrase is to thematter.

120
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.700
Mended again. The matter;proceed.

121
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.700
In brief, to set theneedless process by,

122
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.370
How I persuaded, how Ipray'd, and kneel'd,

123
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.100
How he refell'd me, andhow I replied,--

124
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.130
For this was of muchlength,

125
00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.070
--the vile conclusion

126
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.100
I now begin with grief andshame to utter:

127
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.500
He would not, but by giftof my chaste body

128
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.600
To his concupiscibleintemperate lust,

129
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.630
Release my brother; and,after much debatement,

130
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.000
My sisterly remorseconfutes mine honour,

131
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.300
And I did yield to him:but the next morn betimes,

132
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.130
His purpose surfeiting, hesends a warrant

133
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.770
For my poor brother'shead.

134
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.230
This is most likely!

135
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.730
O, that it were as like asit is true!

136
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.700
By heaven, fond wretch,

137
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.270
thou knowist not what thouspeak'st,

138
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.500
Or else thou art suborn'din hateful practise

139
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.370
against his honour.

140
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.830
First, his integritystands without question.

141
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.000
Next, it imports no reason

142
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.630
That with such vehemencyhe should pursue

143
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.830
Faults proper to himself:

144
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.630
if he had so offended,

145
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.500
He would have weigh'd thybrother by himself

146
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.130
And not have cut him off.

147
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.830
Some one hath set you on:

148
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.270
Confess the truth, and sayby whose advice

149
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.870
Thou camest here tocomplain.

150
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.430
And is this all?

151
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.100
Then, O you blessedministers above,

152
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.570
Keep me in patience, andwith ripen'd time

153
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.570
Unfold the evil which ishere wrapt up

154
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.370
In countenance! Heavenshield your grace from woe,

155
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.200
As I, thus wrong'd, henceunbelieved go!

156
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.900
I know you'ld fain begone.

157
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.670
An officer! To prison withher!

158
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.500
Shall we thus permit

159
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.870
A blasting and ascandalous breath

160
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.970
to fall on him so near us?

161
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.330
This needs must be apractise.

162
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.100
Who knew of Your intentand coming hither?

163
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.670
One that I would werehere, Friar Lodowick.

164
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.530
A ghostly father, belike.

165
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.930
Who knows that Lodowick?

166
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.570
My lord, I know him; 'tisa meddling friar;

167
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.970
I do not like the man:

168
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.130
had he been lay, my lord

169
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.930
For certain words he spakeagainst your grace

170
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.470
In your retirement, I hadswinged him soundly.

171
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.670
Words against me?a good friar, belike!

172
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.300
And to set on thiswretched woman here

173
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.570
Against our substitute!Let this friar be found.

174
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.230
My lord. but yesternight,she and that friar,

175
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.330
I saw them at the prison:

176
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.470
a saucy friar, a veryscurvy fellow.

177
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.470
Blessed be your royalgrace!

178
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.070
I have stood by, my lord,

179
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.300
and I have heard yourroyal ear abused.

180
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.400
First, hath this woman

181
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.170
Most wrongfully accusedyour substitute,

182
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.570
Who is as free from touchor soil with her

183
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.470
As she from one ungot.

184
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.130
We did believe no less.

185
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.700
Know you that Friar Lodowickthat she speaks of?

186
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.570
I know him for a mandivine and holy;

187
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.930
Not scurvy, nor atemporary meddler,

188
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.000
As he's reported by thisgentleman;

189
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.270
And, on my trust, a manthat never yet

190
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.830
Did, as he vouches,misreport your grace.

191
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.130
My lord, most villanously;believe it.

192
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.230
Well, he in time may cometo clear himself;

193
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.200
But at this instant he issick my lord,

194
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.100
Of a strange fever. Uponhis mere request,

195
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.270
Being come to knowledgethat there was complaint

196
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.670
Intended 'gainst LordAngelo, came I hither,

197
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.200
To speak, as from hismouth, what he doth know

198
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.100
Is true and false;

199
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.130
and what he with his oath

200
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.500
And all probation willmake up full clear,

201
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.430
Whensoever he's convented.First, for this woman.

202
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.570
To justify this worthynobleman,

203
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.470
So vulgarly and personallyaccused,

204
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.630
Her shall you heardisproved to her eyes,

205
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.970
Till she herself confessit.

206
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.070
Good friar, let's hear it.

207
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:15.170
Do you not smile at this,Lord Angelo?

208
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.330
O heaven, the vanity ofwretched fools!

209
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.200
Give us some seats. Come,cousin Angelo;

210
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.770
In this I'll be impartial;

211
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:25.500
you be judge of your owncause.

212
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.430
Is this the witness,friar?

213
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.530
First, let her show herface, and after speak.

214
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.730
Pardon, my lord; I willnot show my face

215
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.300
Until my husband bid me.

216
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.500
What, are you married?

217
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.730
No, my lord.

218
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.870
Are you a maid?

219
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:49.570
No, my lord.

220
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.800
A widow, then?

221
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.130
Neither, my lord.

222
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.970
Why, you are nothing then:

223
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.330
neither maid, widow, norwife?

224
00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.570
My lord, she may be apunk;

225
00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:59.670
for many of them

226
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.900
are neither maid, widow,nor wife.

227
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.970
Silence that fellow:

228
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:05.230
I would he had some cause

229
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:06.330
To prattle for himself.

230
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.600
Well, my lord.

231
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.930
My lord; I do confess Ine'er was married;

232
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.900
And I confess besides I amno maid:

233
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.300
I have known my husband;yet my husband

234
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.670
Knows not that ever heknew me.

235
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.430
He was drunk then, mylord:

236
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.830
it can be no better.

237
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.270
For the benefit ofsilence,

238
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.430
would thou wert so too!

239
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:29.570
Well, my lord.

240
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:30.870
This is no witness forLord Angelo.

241
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.230
Now I come to't my lord

242
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.430
She that accuses him offornication,

243
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.000
In self-same manner dothaccuse my husband,

244
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.330
And charges him my lord,

245
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.700
with such a time

246
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.170
When I'll depose I had himin mine arms

247
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:47.370
With all the effect oflove.

248
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.000
Charges she more than me?

249
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.900
Not that I know.

250
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.100
No? you say your husband.

251
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.230
Why, just, my lord, andthat is Angelo,

252
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.070
Who thinks he knows thathe ne'er knew my body,

253
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:05.070
But knows he thinks thathe knows Isabel's.

254
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.270
This is a strange abuse.Let's see thy face.

255
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:14.730
My husband bids me; now Iwill unmask.

256
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.270
This is that face, thoucruel Angelo,

257
00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.630
Which once thou sworestwas worth the looking on;

258
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.700
This is the hand which,with a vow'd contract,

259
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.470
Was fast belock'd inthine;

260
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.570
this is the body

261
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.230
That took away the matchfrom Isabel,

262
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.930
And did supply thee at thygarden-house

263
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.200
In her imagined person.

264
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.030
Know you this woman?

265
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.800
Carnally, she says.

266
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.230
Sirrah, no more!

267
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.030
Enough, my lord.

268
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.730
My lord, I must confess Iknow this woman:

269
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.000
And five years since therewas

270
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.430
some speech of marriage

271
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.000
Betwixt myself and her;which was broke off,

272
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.300
Partly for that herpromised proportions

273
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.970
Came short of composition,but in chief

274
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:59.770
For that her reputationwas disvalued

275
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:03.670
In levity: since whichtime of five years

276
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.500
I never spake with her,saw her,

277
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.270
nor heard from her,

278
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.570
Upon my faith and honour.

279
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.230
Noble prince,

280
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.130
As there comes light fromheaven

281
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.930
and words from breath,

282
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.930
As there is sense in truthand truth in virtue,

283
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:19.430
I am affianced this man'swife as strongly

284
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.430
As words could make upvows:

285
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.130
and, my good lord,

286
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.800
But Tuesday night lastgone in's garden-house

287
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.500
He knew me as a wife.

288
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.500
As this is true,

289
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.430
Let me in safety raise mefrom my knees

290
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.100
Or else for ever beconfixed here,

291
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.530
A marble monument!

292
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.930
I did but smile till now:

293
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:48.470
Now, good my lord, give methe scope of justice

294
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.630
My patience here istouch'd.

295
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.530
I do perceive

296
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:52.970
These poor informal womenare no more

297
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.600
But instruments of somemore mightier member

298
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.170
That sets them on: let mehave way, my lord,

299
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.730
To find this practise out.

300
00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.730
Ay, with my heart

301
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.070
And punish them to yourheight of pleasure.

302
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.970
Thou foolish friar,

303
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.370
and thou pernicious woman,

304
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.370
Compact with her that'sgone,

305
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.030
think'st thou thy oaths,

306
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.630
Though they would sweardown each particular saint,

307
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.830
Were testimonies againsthis worth and credit

308
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.770
That's seal'd in approbation?You, Lord Escalus,

309
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.830
Sit with my cousin; lendhim your kind pains

310
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.500
To find out this abuse,whence 'tis derived.

311
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.730
There is another friarthat set them on;

312
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:26.800
Let him be sent for.

313
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.500
Would he were here, mylord! for he indeed

314
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.000
Hath set the women on tothis complaint:

315
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.970
Your provost knows theplace where he abides

316
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.670
And he may fetch him.

317
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.170
Go do it instantly.

318
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.800
And you, my noble andwell-warranted cousin,

319
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.070
Whom it concerns to hearthis matter forth,

320
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.170
Do with your injuries asseems you best,

321
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.030
In any chastisement: I fora while will leave you;

322
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.500
But stir not you till youhave well determined

323
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.170
Upon these slanderers.

324
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.900
My lord, we'll do itthroughly.

325
00:12:54.430 --> 00:13:03.200
(applause)

326
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.370
Signior Lucio, did not yousay you knew that

327
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.930
Friar Lodowick to be adishonest person?

328
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.130
'Cucullus non facitmonachum:'

329
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.670
honest in nothing but inhis clothes;

330
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.630
and one that hath spoke

331
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.670
most villanous speeches ofthe duke.

332
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.230
We shall entreat you toabide here

333
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.700
till he come and enforcethem against him:

334
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.530
we shall find this friar anotable fellow.

335
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.030
As any in Vienna, on myword.

336
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.900
Call that same Isabel hereonce again;

337
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.270
I would speak with her.

338
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:35.200
Pray you, my lord, give meleave to question;

339
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.630
you shall see how I'llhandle her.

340
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.900
Not better than he, by herown report.

341
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.070
Say you?

342
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.570
Marry, sir, I think, ifyou handled her privately,

343
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.230
she would sooner confess:perchance, publicly,

344
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.100
she'll be ashamed.

345
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.070
I will go darkly to workwith her.

346
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:54.570
That's the way; for womenare light at midnight.

347
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.930
Come on, mistress:

348
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.570
here's a gentlewoman deniesall that you have said.

349
00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.430
My lord, here comes therascal I spoke of;

350
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.030
here with the provost.

351
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.430
In very good time:

352
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.100
speak not you to him tillwe call upon you.

353
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.500
Mum.

354
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.430
Come, sir: did you setthese women on

355
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.570
to slander Lord Angelo?

356
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:13.900
they have confessed youdid.

357
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.600
'Tis false.

358
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.900
How! know you where youare?

359
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.130
Respect to your greatplace!

360
00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.170
and let the devil

361
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.770
Be sometime honour'd forhis burning throne!

362
00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.470
Where is the duke? 'tis heshould hear me speak.

363
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.730
The duke's in us; and wewill hear you speak:

364
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.600
Look you speak justly.

365
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.170
Boldly, at least. But, O,poor souls,

366
00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.530
Come you to seek the lambhere of the fox?

367
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.370
Good night to yourredress! Is the duke gone?

368
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.100
Then is your cause gonetoo.

369
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.270
The duke's unjust,

370
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.500
Thus to retort yourmanifest appeal,

371
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.030
And put your trial in thevillain's mouth

372
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.300
Which here you come toaccuse.

373
00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.630
This is the rascal; thisis he I spoke of.

374
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.600
Why, thou unreverend andunhallow'd friar,

375
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.700
Is't not enough thou hastsuborn'd these women

376
00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.500
To accuse this worthy man,

377
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.400
but, in foul mouth

378
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.970
And in the witness of hisproper ear,

379
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.370
To call him villain?

380
00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.700
and then to glance fromhim to the duke himself,

381
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.770
to tax him with injustice?

382
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.370
Take him hence; to therack with him!

383
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.500
We'll touse you joint byjoint,

384
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.330
but we will know hispurpose. What 'unjust'!

385
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.800
Be not so hot; the duke

386
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.200
Dare no more stretch thisfinger of mine than he

387
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.600
Dare rack his own: hissubject am I not,

388
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.100
Nor here provincial.

389
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.200
My business in this state

390
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.200
Made me a looker on herein Vienna,

391
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.430
Where I have seencorruption boil and bubble

392
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.600
Till it o'er-run the stew;

393
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.130
laws for all faults,

394
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.470
But faults socountenanced,

395
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:46.930
that the strong statutes

396
00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.430
Stand like the forfeits ina barber's shop,

397
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.030
As much in mock as mark.

398
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:55.200
Slander to the state! Awaywith him to prison!

399
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.500
What can you vouch againsthim, Signior Lucio?

400
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.870
Is this the man that youdid tell us of?

401
00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:01.100
'Tis he, my lord.

402
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.570
Come hither, goodmanbaldpate:

403
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:06.970
do you know me?

404
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.370
I remember you, sir, bythe sound of your voice:

405
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.300
I met you at the prison,

406
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.700
in the absence of theduke.

407
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.230
O, did you so?

408
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.500
And do you remember whatyou said of the duke?

409
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.300
Most notedly, sir.

410
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.000
Do you so, sir? And wasthe duke a fleshmonger,

411
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.970
a fool, and a coward,

412
00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:23.800
as you then reported himto be?

413
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.930
You must, sir, changepersons with me,

414
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.270
ere you make that myreport:

415
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.900
for you sir, indeed,spoke of him;

416
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.470
and much more, much worse.

417
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.600
O thou damnable fellow!

418
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.230
Did not I tweak thee bythe nose for thy speeches?

419
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.330
I protest I love the dukeas I love myself.

420
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.970
Hark, how the villainwould close now,

421
00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.930
after his treasonableabuses!

422
00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.130
Such a fellow is not to betalked withal.

423
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.970
Away with him to prison!

424
00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.530
Where is the provost? Awaywith him to prison!

425
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.200
lay bolts enough upon him:

426
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.630
let him speak no more.

427
00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.500
Away with those giglotstoo,

428
00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.070
and with the otherconfederate companion!

429
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.900
Stay, sir; stay awhile.

430
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.030
What, resists he? Helphim, Lucio.

431
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.570
Come, sir; come, sir;come, sir; foh, sir!

432
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:11.270
Why, you bald-pated, lyingrascal,

433
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:14.430
you must be hooded, mustyou?

434
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.500
Show your knave's visage,with a pox to you!

435
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.330
show your sheep-biting face,and be hanged an hour!

436
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:25.930
Will't not off?

437
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:34.870
Thou art the first knave

438
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.070
that e'er madest a duke.

439
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.170
First, provost, let mebail these gentle three.

440
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.800
Sneak not away, sir; forthe friar and you

441
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.570
Must have a word anon. Layhold on him.

442
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.470
This may prove worse thanhanging.

443
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.330
What you have spoke Ipardon: sit you down:

444
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:53.500
We'll borrow place of him.

445
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.530
Sir, by your leave.

446
00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.170
Hast thou or word, or wit,or impudence,

447
00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.570
That yet can do theeoffice? If thou hast,

448
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.400
Rely upon it till my talebe told,

449
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.230
And hold no longer out.

450
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.130
O my dread lord,

451
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.100
I should be guiltier thanmy guiltiness,

452
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.470
To think I can beundiscernible,

453
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.670
When I perceive yourgrace, like power divine,

454
00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:28.330
Hath look'd upon mypasses. Then, good prince,

455
00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:29.600
No longer session holdupon my shame,

456
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.900
But let my trial be mineown confession:

457
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.370
Immediate sentence thenand sequent death

458
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.770
Is all the grace I beg.

459
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:43.130
Come hither, Mariana.

460
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.400
Say, wast thou e'ercontracted to this woman?

461
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.500
I was, my lord.

462
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.070
Go take her hence, andmarry her instantly.

463
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.200
Do you the office, friar;which consummate,

464
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.200
Return him here again. Gowith him, provost.

465
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.170
My lord, I am more amazedat his dishonour

466
00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.930
Than at the strangeness ofit.

467
00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.700
Come hither, Isabel.

468
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.770
Your friar is now yourprince: as I was then

469
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:28.100
Advertising and holy toyour business,

470
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.630
Not changing heart withhabit, I am still

471
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.970
Attorney'd at yourservice.

472
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.100
O, give me pardon,

473
00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.070
That I, your vassal, haveemploy'd and pain'd

474
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.800
Your unknown sovereignty!

475
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.730
You are pardon'd, Isabel:

476
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.570
And now, dear maid, be youas free to us.

477
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.530
Your brother's death, Iknow, sits at your heart;

478
00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.400
And you may marvel why Iobscured myself,

479
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.070
Labouring to save hislife, and would not rather

480
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.300
Make rash remonstrance ofmy hidden power

481
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.470
Than let him so be lost. Omost kind maid,

482
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:59.000
It was the swift celerityof his death,

483
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.870
Which I did think withslower foot came on,

484
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.700
That brain'd my purpose.But, peace be with him!

485
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.070
That life is better life,past fearing death,

486
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.730
Than that which lives tofear: make it your comfort,

487
00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.500
So happy is your brother.

488
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.230
I do, my lord.

489
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.100
For this new-married manapproaching here,

490
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.230
Whose salt imagination yethath wrong'd

491
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.170
Your well defended honour,you must pardon

492
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:27.700
For Mariana's sake: but ashe adjudged your brother

493
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.670
Being criminal, in doubleviolation

494
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.270
Of sacred chastity and ofpromise-breach

495
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.200
Thereon dependent, foryour brother's life,

496
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.900
The very mercy of the lawcries out

497
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.270
Most audible, even fromhis proper tongue,

498
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:45.470
'An Angelo for Claudio,death for death!'

499
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.030
Haste still pays haste,

500
00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:49.070
and leisure answersleisure;

501
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:53.830
Like doth quit like, andMEASURE still FOR MEASURE.

502
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.970
Thus, Angelo, your fault'sthus manifested;

503
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:57.530
Which, though thou wouldstdeny,

504
00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.770
denies thee vantage.

505
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.770
We do condemn thee to thevery block

506
00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:05.030
Where Claudio stoop'd todeath, and with like haste.

507
00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:05.970
Away with him!

508
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.030
O my most gracious lord,

509
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.070
I hope you will not mockme with a husband.

510
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.230
It is your husband mock'dyou with a husband.

511
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.330
Consenting to thesafeguard of your honour,

512
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.170
I thought your marriagefit; else imputation,

513
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:17.700
For that he knew you,might reproach your life

514
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.870
And choke your good tocome;

515
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:20.830
for his possessions,

516
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.670
Although by confiscationthey are ours,

517
00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.370
We do instate and widowyou withal,

518
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.670
To buy you a betterhusband.

519
00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.100
O my dear lord,

520
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.200
I crave no other, nor nobetter man.

521
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.030
Never crave him; we aredefinitive.

522
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.970
Gentle my liege,--

523
00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:32.630
You do but lose yourlabour.

524
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:33.770
Away with him to death!

525
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.530
Now, sir, to you.

526
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:40.230
O my good lord! SweetIsabel, take my part;

527
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.230
Lend me your knees, andall my life to come

528
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.700
I'll lend you all my lifeto do you service.

529
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.670
Against all sense you doimportune her:

530
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.970
Should she kneel down inmercy of this fact,

531
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.800
Her brother's ghost hispaved bed would break,

532
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.870
And take her hence inhorror.

533
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:56.870
Isabel,

534
00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:01.630
Sweet Isabel, do yet butkneel by me;

535
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:06.070
Hold up your hands, saynothing; I'll speak all.

536
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:12.000
They say, best men aremoulded out of faults;

537
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.270
And, for the most, becomemuch more the better

538
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:21.130
For being a little bad: somay my husband.

539
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:27.330
O Isabel, will you notlend a knee?

540
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.130
He dies for Claudio'sdeath.

541
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:33.000
Most bounteous sir,

542
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.770
Look, if it please you, onthis man condemn'd,

543
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.270
As if my brother lived:

544
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.130
I partly think

545
00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:41.670
A due sincerity govern'dhis deeds,

546
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.100
Till he did look on me:

547
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.930
since it is so, let himnot die.

548
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:49.700
My brother had butjustice,

549
00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.630
In that he did the thingfor which he died:

550
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:53.530
For Angelo,

551
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.570
His act did not o'ertakehis bad intent,

552
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.330
And must be buried but asan intent

553
00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:05.030
That perish'd by the way:thoughts are no subjects;

554
00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.500
Intents but merelythoughts.

555
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.430
Merely, my lord.

556
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:13.070
Your suit's unprofitable;stand up, I say.

557
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.500
I have bethought me ofanother fault.

558
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:26.630
Provost, how came itClaudio was beheaded

559
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.270
At an unusual hour?

560
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.670
It was commanded so.

561
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.170
Had you a special warrantfor the deed?

562
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.870
No, my good lord; it wasby private message.

563
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:35.770
For which I do dischargeyou of your office:

564
00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.900
Give up your keys.

565
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:41.730
Pardon me, noble lord:

566
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.000
I thought it was a fault,but knew it not;

567
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.600
Yet did repent me, aftermore advice;

568
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.600
For testimony whereof, onein the prison,

569
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.270
That should by privateorder else have died,

570
00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.070
I have reserved alive.

571
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:55.370
What's he?

572
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:56.930
His name is Barnardine.

573
00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.170
I would thou hadst done soby Claudio.

574
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:03.330
Go fetch him hither; letme look upon him.

575
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.730
I am sorry, one so learnedand so wise

576
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.330
As you, Lord Angelo, havestill appear'd,

577
00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:14.870
Should slip so grossly,

578
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:15.870
both in the heat of blood.

579
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.600
And lack of temper'djudgment afterward.

580
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.800
I am sorry that suchsorrow I procure:

581
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.070
And so deep sticks it inmy penitent heart

582
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.830
That I crave death morewillingly than mercy;

583
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.300
'Tis my deserving, and Ido entreat it.

584
00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.630
Which is that Barnardine?

585
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:43.100
This, my lord.

586
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.800
There was a friar told meof this man.

587
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.000
Sirrah, thou art said tohave a stubborn soul.

588
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.370
That apprehends no furtherthan this world,

589
00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.200
And squarest thy lifeaccording.

590
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.700
Thou'rt condemn'd:

591
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.630
But, for those earthlyfaults, I quit them all;

592
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.270
And pray thee take thismercy to provide

593
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:01.130
For better times to come.Advise him, ,Friar;

594
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.400
I leave him to your hand.

595
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.070
What muffled fellow'sthat?

596
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.870
This is another prisonerthat I saved.

597
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:10.570
Who should have died whenClaudio lost his head;

598
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:14.230
As like almost to Claudioas himself.

599
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.400
If he be like yourbrother, for his sake

600
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:26.100
Is he pardon'd; and, foryour lovely sake,

601
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.530
Give me your hand and sayyou will be mine.

602
00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:34.200
He is my brother too: butfitter time for that.

603
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.800
By this Lord Angeloperceives he's safe;

604
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.630
Methinks I see aquickening in his eye.

605
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:42.070
Well, Angelo, your evilquits you well:

606
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:43.500
Look that you love yourwife;

607
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.530
her worth worth yours.

608
00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:49.700
I find an apt remission inmyself;

609
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.800
And yet here's one inplace I cannot pardon.

610
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:58.630
You, sirrah, that knew mefor an ass, a fool,

611
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.370
One all of luxury, acoward;

612
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.970
Wherein have I so deservedof you,

613
00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.570
That you extol me so?

614
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:06.430
'Faith, my lord.

615
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.800
I spoke it but accordingto the trick.

616
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.870
If you will hang me forit, you may;

617
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:12.070
but I had rather it wouldplease you

618
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.470
I might be whipt.

619
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:16.500
Whipt first, sir, andhanged after.

620
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.730
Proclaim it, provost,round about the city.

621
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.730
Is any woman wrong'd bythis lewd fellow,

622
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.770
As I have heard him swearhimself there's one

623
00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:26.230
Whom he begot with child,let her appear,

624
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.400
And he shall marry herinstantly:

625
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.400
the nuptial finish'd,

626
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.470
Let him be whipt andhang'd.

627
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:32.870
I beseech your highness,

628
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:35.000
do not marry me to awhore.

629
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.370
Your highness said evennow, I made you a duke:

630
00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:39.330
good my lord,

631
00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.900
do not recompense me inmaking me a cuckold.

632
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.870
Upon mine honesty, thoushalt marry her.

633
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.000
Thy slanders I forgive;and therewithal

634
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.030
Remit thy other forfeits.Take him to prison;

635
00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.130
And see our pleasureherein executed.

636
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.130
Marrying a punk, my lord,

637
00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.300
is pressing to death,whipping, and hanging.

638
00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:00.570
Slandering a princedeserves it.

639
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:13.030
She that you wrong'd,Claudio, look you restore.

640
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:17.030
Joy to you, Mariana! Loveher, Angelo:

641
00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.800
I have confess'd her and Iknow her virtue.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.070

643
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.200

There's more behind thatis more gratulate.
