2
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.830
(applause and cheering)

3
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.400
My very worthy cousin, fairly met!

4
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.330
Happy return be to your royal grace!

5
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.470
Our old and faithful friend,

6
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.700
we are glad to see you.

7
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.930
Happy return be to your royal grace!

8
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.570
Many and hearty thankings to you both.

9
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.370
We have made inquiry of you;

10
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.900
and we hear such goodness of your justice,

11
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.900
that our soul

12
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.730
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,

13
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.830
Forerunning more requital.

14
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.730
You make my bonds still greater.

15
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.970
O, your desert speaks loud;

16
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.970
and I should wrong it,

17
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.700
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,

18
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.300
When it deserves, with characters of brass,

19
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.870
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time

20
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.170
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,

21
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.030
And let the subject see, to make them know

22
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.530
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim

23
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.430
Favours that keep within.

24
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.330
Escalus, come!

25
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.030
You must walk by us on our other hand;

26
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.670
And good supporters are you.

27
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.200
Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.

28
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.800
Justice, O royal duke!

29
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.730
Vail your regard

30
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.600
Upon a wrong'd,

31
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.670
I would fain have said, a maid!

32
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.800
O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye

33
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.630
By throwing it on any other object

34
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.700
Till you have heard me in my true complaint

35
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.630
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!

36
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.000
Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.

37
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.470
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:

38
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.570
Reveal yourself to him.

39
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.500
O worthy prince,

40
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.270
You bid me seek redemption of the devil:

41
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.400
Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak

42
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.030
Must either punish me, not being believed,

43
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.870
Or wring redress from you.

44
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.600
Hear me, O hear me, here!

45
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.370
My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:

46
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.330
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother

47
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.300
Cut off by course of justice

48
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.370
By course of justice!

49
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.870
And she will speak most bitterly and strange.

50
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.670
Most strange, and yet most truly, will I speak:

51
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.670
That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?

52
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.630
That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?

53
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.370
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,

54
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.600
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;

55
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.730
Is it not strange and strange?

56
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.730
Nay, it is ten times strange.

57
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.070
It is not truer he is Angelo

58
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.300
Than this is all as true as it is strange:

59
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.870
Nay, it is ten times true;

60
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.370
for truth is truth to the end of reckoning.

61
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.500
Away with her!

62
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.800
Poor soul, She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.

63
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.130
O prince, I conjure thee,

64
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.000
as thou believest

65
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.070
There is another comfort than this world,

66
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.400
That thou dismiss me not, with that opinion

67
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.130
That I am touch'd with madness!

68
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.600
Make not impossible

69
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.770
That which but seems unlike:

70
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.900
'tis not impossible

71
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.300
But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,

72
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.670
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute

73
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.330
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,

74
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.170
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,

75
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.200
Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:

76
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.000
If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,

77
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.300
Had I more name for badness.

78
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.230
By mine honesty,

79
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.200
If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--

80
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.000
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,

81
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.330
Such a dependency of thing on thing,

82
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.100
As e'er I heard in madness.

83
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.730
O gracious duke,

84
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.500
Harp not on that,

85
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.200
nor do not banish reason for inequality;

86
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.770
but let your reason serve

87
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.530
To make the truth appear where it seems hid,

88
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.530
And hide the false seems true.

89
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.170
Many that are not mad

90
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.800
Have, sure, more lack of reason.

91
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.670
What would you say?

92
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.400
I am the sister of one Claudio,

93
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.430
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication

94
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.570
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:

95
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.000
I, in probation of a sisterhood,

96
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.100
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio

97
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.570
As then the messenger

98
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.200
That's I, an't like your grace:

99
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.170
I came to her from Claudio, and desired her

100
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.900
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo

101
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.700
For her poor brother's pardon.

102
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.700
That's he indeed.

103
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.800
You were not bid to speak.

104
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.670
No, my good lord;

105
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.570
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.

106
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.730
I pray you now, then;

107
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.000
Pray you, take note of it:

108
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.670
and when you have a business for yourself,

109
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.070
pray heaven you then be perfect.

110
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.670
I warrant your honour.

111
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.500
The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.

112
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.570
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale

113
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.470
Right.

114
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.100
It may be right; but you are i' the wrong

115
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.830
To speak before your time. Proceed.

116
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.170
I went to this pernicious caitiff deputy

117
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.070
That's somewhat madly spoken.

118
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.770
Pardon it;

119
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.230
The phrase is to the matter.

120
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.700
Mended again. The matter; proceed.

121
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.700
In brief, to set the needless process by,

122
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.370
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,

123
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.100
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--

124
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.130
For this was of much length,

125
00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.070
--the vile conclusion

126
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.100
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:

127
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.500
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body

128
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.600
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,

129
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.630
Release my brother; and, after much debatement,

130
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.000
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,

131
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.300
And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,

132
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.130
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant

133
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.770
For my poor brother's head.

134
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.230
This is most likely!

135
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.730
O, that it were as like as it is true!

136
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.700
By heaven, fond wretch,

137
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.270
thou knowist not what thou speak'st,

138
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.500
Or else thou art suborn'd in hateful practise

139
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.370
against his honour.

140
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.830
First, his integrity stands without question.

141
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.000
Next, it imports no reason

142
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.630
That with such vehemency he should pursue

143
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.830
Faults proper to himself:

144
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.630
if he had so offended,

145
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.500
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself

146
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.130
And not have cut him off.

147
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.830
Some one hath set you on:

148
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.270
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice

149
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.870
Thou camest here to complain.

150
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.430
And is this all?

151
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.100
Then, O you blessed ministers above,

152
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.570
Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time

153
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.570
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up

154
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.370
In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,

155
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.200
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

156
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.900
I know you'ld fain be gone.

157
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.670
An officer! To prison with her!

158
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.500
Shall we thus permit

159
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.870
A blasting and a scandalous breath

160
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.970
to fall on him so near us?

161
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.330
This needs must be a practise.

162
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.100
Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?

163
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.670
One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.

164
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.530
A ghostly father, belike.

165
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.930
Who knows that Lodowick?

166
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.570
My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;

167
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.970
I do not like the man:

168
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.130
had he been lay, my lord

169
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.930
For certain words he spake against your grace

170
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.470
In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.

171
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.670
Words against me? a good friar, belike!

172
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.300
And to set on this wretched woman here

173
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.570
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.

174
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.230
My lord. but yesternight, she and that friar,

175
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.330
I saw them at the prison:

176
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.470
a saucy friar, a very scurvy fellow.

177
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.470
Blessed be your royal grace!

178
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.070
I have stood by, my lord,

179
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.300
and I have heard your royal ear abused.

180
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.400
First, hath this woman

181
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.170
Most wrongfully accused your substitute,

182
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.570
Who is as free from touch or soil with her

183
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.470
As she from one ungot.

184
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.130
We did believe no less.

185
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.700
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

186
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.570
I know him for a man divine and holy;

187
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.930
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,

188
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.000
As he's reported by this gentleman;

189
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.270
And, on my trust, a man that never yet

190
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.830
Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.

191
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.130
My lord, most villanously; believe it.

192
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.230
Well, he in time may come to clear himself;

193
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.200
But at this instant he is sick my lord,

194
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.100
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,

195
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.270
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint

196
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.670
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,

197
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.200
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know

198
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.100
Is true and false;

199
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.130
and what he with his oath

200
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.500
And all probation will make up full clear,

201
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.430
Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.

202
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.570
To justify this worthy nobleman,

203
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.470
So vulgarly and personally accused,

204
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.630
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,

205
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.970
Till she herself confess it.

206
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.070
Good friar, let's hear it.

207
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:15.170
Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?

208
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.330
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!

209
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.200
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;

210
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.770
In this I'll be impartial;

211
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:25.500
you be judge of your own cause.

212
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.430
Is this the witness, friar?

213
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.530
First, let her show her face, and after speak.

214
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.730
Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face

215
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.300
Until my husband bid me.

216
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.500
What, are you married?

217
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.730
No, my lord.

218
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.870
Are you a maid?

219
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:49.570
No, my lord.

220
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.800
A widow, then?

221
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.130
Neither, my lord.

222
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.970
Why, you are nothing then:

223
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.330
neither maid, widow, nor wife?

224
00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.570
My lord, she may be a punk;

225
00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:59.670
for many of them

226
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.900
are neither maid, widow, nor wife.

227
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.970
Silence that fellow:

228
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:05.230
I would he had some cause

229
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:06.330
To prattle for himself.

230
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.600
Well, my lord.

231
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.930
My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;

232
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.900
And I confess besides I am no maid:

233
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.300
I have known my husband; yet my husband

234
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.670
Knows not that ever he knew me.

235
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.430
He was drunk then, my lord:

236
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.830
it can be no better.

237
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.270
For the benefit of silence,

238
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.430
would thou wert so too!

239
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:29.570
Well, my lord.

240
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:30.870
This is no witness for Lord Angelo.

241
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.230
Now I come to't my lord

242
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.430
She that accuses him of fornication,

243
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.000
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,

244
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.330
And charges him my lord,

245
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.700
with such a time

246
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.170
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms

247
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:47.370
With all the effect of love.

248
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.000
Charges she more than me?

249
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.900
Not that I know.

250
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.100
No? you say your husband.

251
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.230
Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,

252
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.070
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,

253
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:05.070
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.

254
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.270
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.

255
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:14.730
My husband bids me; now I will unmask.

256
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.270
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,

257
00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.630
Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;

258
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.700
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,

259
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.470
Was fast belock'd in thine;

260
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.570
this is the body

261
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.230
That took away the match from Isabel,

262
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.930
And did supply thee at thy garden-house

263
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.200
In her imagined person.

264
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.030
Know you this woman?

265
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.800
Carnally, she says.

266
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.230
Sirrah, no more!

267
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.030
Enough, my lord.

268
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.730
My lord, I must confess I know this woman:

269
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.000
And five years since there was

270
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.430
some speech of marriage

271
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.000
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,

272
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.300
Partly for that her promised proportions

273
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.970
Came short of composition, but in chief

274
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:59.770
For that her reputation was disvalued

275
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:03.670
In levity: since which time of five years

276
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.500
I never spake with her, saw her,

277
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.270
nor heard from her,

278
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.570
Upon my faith and honour.

279
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.230
Noble prince,

280
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.130
As there comes light from heaven

281
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.930
and words from breath,

282
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.930
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,

283
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:19.430
I am affianced this man's wife as strongly

284
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.430
As words could make up vows:

285
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.130
and, my good lord,

286
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.800
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house

287
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.500
He knew me as a wife.

288
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.500
As this is true,

289
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.430
Let me in safety raise me from my knees

290
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.100
Or else for ever be confixed here,

291
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.530
A marble monument!

292
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.930
I did but smile till now:

293
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:48.470
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice

294
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.630
My patience here is touch'd.

295
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.530
I do perceive

296
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:52.970
These poor informal women are no more

297
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.600
But instruments of some more mightier member

298
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.170
That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,

299
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.730
To find this practise out.

300
00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.730
Ay, with my heart

301
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.070
And punish them to your height of pleasure.

302
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.970
Thou foolish friar,

303
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.370
and thou pernicious woman,

304
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.370
Compact with her that's gone,

305
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.030
think'st thou thy oaths,

306
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.630
Though they would swear down each particular saint,

307
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.830
Were testimonies against his worth and credit

308
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.770
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,

309
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.830
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains

310
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.500
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.

311
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.730
There is another friar that set them on;

312
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:26.800
Let him be sent for.

313
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.500
Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed

314
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.000
Hath set the women on to this complaint:

315
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.970
Your provost knows the place where he abides

316
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.670
And he may fetch him.

317
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.170
Go do it instantly.

318
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.800
And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,

319
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.070
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,

320
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.170
Do with your injuries as seems you best,

321
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.030
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;

322
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.500
But stir not you till you have well determined

323
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.170
Upon these slanderers.

324
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.900
My lord, we'll do it throughly.

325
00:12:54.430 --> 00:13:03.200
(applause)

326
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.370
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that

327
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.930
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?

328
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.130
'Cucullus non facit monachum:'

329
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.670
honest in nothing but in his clothes;

330
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.630
and one that hath spoke

331
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.670
most villanous speeches of the duke.

332
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.230
We shall entreat you to abide here

333
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.700
till he come and enforce them against him:

334
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.530
we shall find this friar a notable fellow.

335
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.030
As any in Vienna, on my word.

336
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.900
Call that same Isabel here once again;

337
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.270
I would speak with her.

338
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:35.200
Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question;

339
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.630
you shall see how I'll handle her.

340
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.900
Not better than he, by her own report.

341
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.070
Say you?

342
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.570
Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,

343
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.230
she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,

344
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.100
she'll be ashamed.

345
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.070
I will go darkly to work with her.

346
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:54.570
That's the way; for women are light at midnight.

347
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.930
Come on, mistress:

348
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.570
here's a gentlewoman denies all that you have said.

349
00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.430
My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of;

350
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.030
here with the provost.

351
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.430
In very good time:

352
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.100
speak not you to him till we call upon you.

353
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.500
Mum.

354
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.430
Come, sir: did you set these women on

355
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.570
to slander Lord Angelo?

356
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:13.900
they have confessed you did.

357
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.600
'Tis false.

358
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.900
How! know you where you are?

359
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.130
Respect to your great place!

360
00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.170
and let the devil

361
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.770
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!

362
00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.470
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.

363
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.730
The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:

364
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.600
Look you speak justly.

365
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.170
Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,

366
00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.530
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?

367
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.370
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?

368
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.100
Then is your cause gone too.

369
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.270
The duke's unjust,

370
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.500
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,

371
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.030
And put your trial in the villain's mouth

372
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.300
Which here you come to accuse.

373
00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.630
This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.

374
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.600
Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,

375
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.700
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women

376
00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.500
To accuse this worthy man,

377
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.400
but, in foul mouth

378
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.970
And in the witness of his proper ear,

379
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.370
To call him villain?

380
00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.700
and then to glance from him to the duke himself,

381
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.770
to tax him with injustice?

382
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.370
Take him hence; to the rack with him!

383
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.500
We'll touse you joint by joint,

384
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.330
but we will know his purpose. What 'unjust'!

385
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.800
Be not so hot; the duke

386
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.200
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he

387
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.600
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,

388
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.100
Nor here provincial.

389
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.200
My business in this state

390
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.200
Made me a looker on here in Vienna,

391
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.430
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble

392
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.600
Till it o'er-run the stew;

393
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.130
laws for all faults,

394
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.470
But faults so countenanced,

395
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:46.930
that the strong statutes

396
00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.430
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,

397
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.030
As much in mock as mark.

398
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:55.200
Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!

399
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.500
What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?

400
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.870
Is this the man that you did tell us of?

401
00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:01.100
'Tis he, my lord.

402
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.570
Come hither, goodman baldpate:

403
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:06.970
do you know me?

404
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.370
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice:

405
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.300
I met you at the prison,

406
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.700
in the absence of the duke.

407
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.230
O, did you so?

408
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.500
And do you remember what you said of the duke?

409
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.300
Most notedly, sir.

410
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.000
Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger,

411
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.970
a fool, and a coward,

412
00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:23.800
as you then reported him to be?

413
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.930
You must, sir, change persons with me,

414
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.270
ere you make that my report:

415
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.900
for you sir, indeed, spoke of him;

416
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.470
and much more, much worse.

417
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.600
O thou damnable fellow!

418
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.230
Did not I tweak thee by the nose for thy speeches?

419
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.330
I protest I love the duke as I love myself.

420
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.970
Hark, how the villain would close now,

421
00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.930
after his treasonable abuses!

422
00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.130
Such a fellow is not to be talked withal.

423
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.970
Away with him to prison!

424
00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.530
Where is the provost? Away with him to prison!

425
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.200
lay bolts enough upon him:

426
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.630
let him speak no more.

427
00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.500
Away with those giglots too,

428
00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.070
and with the other confederate companion!

429
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.900
Stay, sir; stay awhile.

430
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.030
What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.

431
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.570
Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir!

432
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:11.270
Why, you bald-pated, lying rascal,

433
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:14.430
you must be hooded, must you?

434
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.500
Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!

435
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.330
show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!

436
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:25.930
Will't not off?

437
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:34.870
Thou art the first knave

438
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.070
that e'er madest a duke.

439
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.170
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.

440
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.800
Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you

441
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.570
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.

442
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.470
This may prove worse than hanging.

443
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.330
What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:

444
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:53.500
We'll borrow place of him.

445
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.530
Sir, by your leave.

446
00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.170
Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,

447
00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.570
That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,

448
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.400
Rely upon it till my tale be told,

449
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.230
And hold no longer out.

450
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.130
O my dread lord,

451
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.100
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,

452
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.470
To think I can be undiscernible,

453
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.670
When I perceive your grace, like power divine,

454
00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:28.330
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,

455
00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:29.600
No longer session hold upon my shame,

456
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.900
But let my trial be mine own confession:

457
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.370
Immediate sentence then and sequent death

458
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.770
Is all the grace I beg.

459
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:43.130
Come hither, Mariana.

460
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.400
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?

461
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.500
I was, my lord.

462
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.070
Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.

463
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.200
Do you the office, friar; which consummate,

464
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.200
Return him here again. Go with him, provost.

465
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.170
My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour

466
00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.930
Than at the strangeness of it.

467
00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.700
Come hither, Isabel.

468
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.770
Your friar is now your prince: as I was then

469
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:28.100
Advertising and holy to your business,

470
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.630
Not changing heart with habit, I am still

471
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.970
Attorney'd at your service.

472
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.100
O, give me pardon,

473
00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.070
That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd

474
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.800
Your unknown sovereignty!

475
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.730
You are pardon'd, Isabel:

476
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.570
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.

477
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.530
Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;

478
00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.400
And you may marvel why I obscured myself,

479
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.070
Labouring to save his life, and would not rather

480
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.300
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power

481
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.470
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,

482
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:59.000
It was the swift celerity of his death,

483
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.870
Which I did think with slower foot came on,

484
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.700
That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!

485
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.070
That life is better life, past fearing death,

486
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.730
Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,

487
00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.500
So happy is your brother.

488
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.230
I do, my lord.

489
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.100
For this new-married man approaching here,

490
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.230
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd

491
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.170
Your well defended honour, you must pardon

492
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:27.700
For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother

493
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.670
Being criminal, in double violation

494
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.270
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach

495
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.200
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,

496
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.900
The very mercy of the law cries out

497
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.270
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,

498
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:45.470
'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'

499
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.030
Haste still pays haste,

500
00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:49.070
and leisure answers leisure;

501
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:53.830
Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.

502
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.970
Thus, Angelo, your fault's thus manifested;

503
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:57.530
Which, though thou wouldst deny,

504
00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.770
denies thee vantage.

505
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.770
We do condemn thee to the very block

506
00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:05.030
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.

507
00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:05.970
Away with him!

508
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.030
O my most gracious lord,

509
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.070
I hope you will not mock me with a husband.

510
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.230
It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.

511
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.330
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,

512
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.170
I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,

513
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:17.700
For that he knew you, might reproach your life

514
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.870
And choke your good to come;

515
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:20.830
for his possessions,

516
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.670
Although by confiscation they are ours,

517
00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.370
We do instate and widow you withal,

518
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.670
To buy you a better husband.

519
00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.100
O my dear lord,

520
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.200
I crave no other, nor no better man.

521
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.030
Never crave him; we are definitive.

522
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.970
Gentle my liege,--

523
00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:32.630
You do but lose your labour.

524
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:33.770
Away with him to death!

525
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.530
Now, sir, to you.

526
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:40.230
O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;

527
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.230
Lend me your knees, and all my life to come

528
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.700
I'll lend you all my life to do you service.

529
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.670
Against all sense you do importune her:

530
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.970
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,

531
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.800
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,

532
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.870
And take her hence in horror.

533
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:56.870
Isabel,

534
00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:01.630
Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;

535
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:06.070
Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.

536
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:12.000
They say, best men are moulded out of faults;

537
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.270
And, for the most, become much more the better

538
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:21.130
For being a little bad: so may my husband.

539
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:27.330
O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?

540
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.130
He dies for Claudio's death.

541
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:33.000
Most bounteous sir,

542
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.770
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,

543
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.270
As if my brother lived:

544
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.130
I partly think

545
00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:41.670
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,

546
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.100
Till he did look on me:

547
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.930
since it is so, let him not die.

548
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:49.700
My brother had but justice,

549
00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.630
In that he did the thing for which he died:

550
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:53.530
For Angelo,

551
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.570
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,

552
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.330
And must be buried but as an intent

553
00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:05.030
That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;

554
00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.500
Intents but merely thoughts.

555
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.430
Merely, my lord.

556
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:13.070
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.

557
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.500
I have bethought me of another fault.

558
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:26.630
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded

559
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.270
At an unusual hour?

560
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.670
It was commanded so.

561
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.170
Had you a special warrant for the deed?

562
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.870
No, my good lord; it was by private message.

563
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:35.770
For which I do discharge you of your office:

564
00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.900
Give up your keys.

565
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:41.730
Pardon me, noble lord:

566
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.000
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;

567
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.600
Yet did repent me, after more advice;

568
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.600
For testimony whereof, one in the prison,

569
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.270
That should by private order else have died,

570
00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.070
I have reserved alive.

571
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:55.370
What's he?

572
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:56.930
His name is Barnardine.

573
00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.170
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.

574
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:03.330
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.

575
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.730
I am sorry, one so learned and so wise

576
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.330
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,

577
00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:14.870
Should slip so grossly,

578
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:15.870
both in the heat of blood.

579
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.600
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.

580
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.800
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:

581
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.070
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart

582
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.830
That I crave death more willingly than mercy;

583
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.300
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.

584
00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.630
Which is that Barnardine?

585
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:43.100
This, my lord.

586
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.800
There was a friar told me of this man.

587
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.000
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.

588
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.370
That apprehends no further than this world,

589
00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.200
And squarest thy life according.

590
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.700
Thou'rt condemn'd:

591
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.630
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;

592
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.270
And pray thee take this mercy to provide

593
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:01.130
For better times to come. Advise him, ,Friar;

594
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.400
I leave him to your hand.

595
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.070
What muffled fellow's that?

596
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.870
This is another prisoner that I saved.

597
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:10.570
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;

598
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:14.230
As like almost to Claudio as himself.

599
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.400
If he be like your brother, for his sake

600
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:26.100
Is he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake,

601
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.530
Give me your hand and say you will be mine.

602
00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:34.200
He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.

603
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.800
By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;

604
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.630
Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.

605
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:42.070
Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:

606
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:43.500
Look that you love your wife;

607
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.530
her worth worth yours.

608
00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:49.700
I find an apt remission in myself;

609
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.800
And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.

610
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:58.630
You, sirrah, that knew me for an ass, a fool,

611
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.370
One all of luxury, a coward;

612
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.970
Wherein have I so deserved of you,

613
00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.570
That you extol me so?

614
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:06.430
'Faith, my lord.

615
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.800
I spoke it but according to the trick.

616
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.870
If you will hang me for it, you may;

617
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:12.070
but I had rather it would please you

618
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.470
I might be whipt.

619
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:16.500
Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.

620
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.730
Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.

621
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.730
Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,

622
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.770
As I have heard him swear himself there's one

623
00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:26.230
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,

624
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.400
And he shall marry her instantly:

625
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.400
the nuptial finish'd,

626
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.470
Let him be whipt and hang'd.

627
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:32.870
I beseech your highness,

628
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:35.000
do not marry me to a whore.

629
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.370
Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:

630
00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:39.330
good my lord,

631
00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.900
do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.

632
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.870
Upon mine honesty, thou shalt marry her.

633
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.000
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal

634
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.030
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;

635
00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.130
And see our pleasure herein executed.

636
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.130
Marrying a punk, my lord,

637
00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.300
is pressing to death, whipping, and hanging.

638
00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:00.570
Slandering a prince deserves it.

639
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:13.030
She that you wrong'd, Claudio, look you restore.

640
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:17.030
Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:

641
00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.800
I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.

642
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.070
Much thanks, good friend Escalus,

643
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.200
for thy much goodness:

644
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.530
There's more behind that is more gratulate.

645
00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:29.930
Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:

646
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:31.770
We shill employ thee in a worthier place.

647
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.430
Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home

648
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:35.400
The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:

649
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.570
The offence pardons itself.

650
00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.230
Dear Isabel,

651
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.700
I have a motion much imports your good;

652
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.300
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,

653
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:52.900
What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.

654
00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.600
So, bring us to our chamber where we'll show

655
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.800
What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.

656
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.370
(♪applause, cheering and music)

657
00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:35.030
