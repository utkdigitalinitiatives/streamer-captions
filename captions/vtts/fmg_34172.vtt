NARRATOR: THE GLOBALIZATION
 OF THE WORLD'S ECONOMY

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
HAS BROUGHT WITH IT
 THE LARGEST MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
IN THE HISTORY OF MODERN TIMES.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
EVERYWHERE,
 MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
ARE ON THEIR WAY
 TO SOMEWHERE NEW.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
NO WALL OR BARRIER IS STRONG
 ENOUGH TO STOP MIGRANTS

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
AS THEY CROSS
 INTERNATIONAL BORDERS

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
ON A JOURNEY
 TO WHERE THE ACTION IS:

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
GLOBAL CITIES.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
NARRATOR:
 LONDON, 1888.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
THE BRITISH EMPIRE
 LOOKS AS ENDURING,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
DEPENDABLE AND SOLID
 AS THE BANK OF ENGLAND.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
AND LONDON IS THE WORLD'S
 FINANCIAL CAPITAL,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
ATTRACTING INVESTORS AND
 ENTREPRENEURS LIKE A MAGNET.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
LONDON IS ALSO ATTRACTING
 THOUSANDS OF IMMIGRANTS

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
IN SEARCH OF GOOD WAGES,
 A BETTER FUTURE,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
OR FREEDOM.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
BUT IT TOOK A SERIES OF
 VICIOUS AND GRUESOME MURDERS

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
TO BRING TO THE
 PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
THE HARSH POVERTY
 OF IMMIGRANT LIFE

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
IN THE HEART OF
 THE IMPERIAL CAPITAL ITSELF.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
200,000 IMMIGRANTS LIVED
 IN THE SLUMS OF WHITECHAPEL,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
A LONDON NEIGHBORHOOD
 AND THE SCENE OF THE CRIMES

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
OF THE FIRST
 BRITISH SERIAL KILLER:

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
JACK THE RIPPER.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
TODAY, 80% OF THE PEOPLE
 IN WHITECHAPEL ARE IMMIGRANTS.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
AND "JACK THE RIPPER WALKS"
 AROUNDWHITECHAPEL

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
HAVE BECOME STANDARD PART
 OF THE LONDON EXPERIENCE

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
FOR MANY TOURISTS.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
AND FOR THOSE WHO PROUDLY
 CALL THEMSELVES LONDONERS

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
THE LEGEND OF JACK THE RIPPER

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
IS NOW PART OF
 THEIR CULTURAL HERITAGE.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
OH, JACK THE RIPPER. YEAH,
OF COURSE, OF ALDGATE, YES. YES.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
HE KILLED PROSTITUTES
 ALL AROUND THAT AREA, YEAH.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
NARRATOR: BUT FOR MOST OF THE
 NEW IMMIGRANTS OF WHITECHAPEL,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
THE LEGEND OF JACK THE RIPPER

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
IS AS FOREIGN AS MANY
 OTHER BRITISH TRADITIONS.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
FEMALE INTERVIEWER: DO YOU KNOW
WHO JACK THE RIPPER IS?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
JACK THE RIPPER?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
WHO IS JACK THE RIPPER?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
JACK THE RIPPER?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
YES! HE LIVES AROUND HERE.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
OF COURSE
I KNOW WHO JACK THE RIPPER IS.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
HE'S A RAP SINGER.

NARRATOR:
 THE RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
MULTI-DIMENSION OF LONDON TODAY

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
IS MAKING MANY PEOPLE CONCERNED
 THAT THE BRITISH WAY OF LIFE

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
IS BEING ECLIPSED BY
 MOSTLY NON-WHITE IMMIGRANTS

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
WHO DRESS DIFFERENTLY,
 COOK DIFFERENTLY

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
AND PRAY DIFFERENTLY
 FROM THE ANGLO-SAXON MAJORITY.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
PEOPLE WHO DECIDE TO
LIVE IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
THAN WHERE THEY WERE BORN

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
SHOULD INTEGRATE AND ASSIMILATE

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
INTO THE COUNTRY IN WHICH
THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO LIVE.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
FEMALE INTERVIEWER: I SEE
 SO MANY CULTURES AND RACES HERE

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
AND I OFTEN WONDER,
 WHOSE COUNTRY IS THIS, ANYWAY?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I'M A WIDOW FROM THE LAST WAR...

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
AND...
MY HUSBAND DIDN'T FIGHT

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
FOR WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THIS COUNTRY NOW.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
WELL, YES, BUT I MEAN,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
IF YOU TURN TO
AN ASIAN OR A WEST INDIAN,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
AND YOU ASK THEM, YOU KNOW,
WHAT NATIONALITY THEY ARE,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
THEY TELL YOU
THEY'RE BRITISH.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
LOOK, I'VE BEEN HERE 30 YEARS.
I DESERVE IT.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I DESERVE TO BE BRITISH.
JUST LIKE THESE, BRITISH.

[POLICE SIRENS BLARING]

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
NARRATOR:
 WHO IS BRITISH TODAY,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
IS A QUESTION THAT SEEMS TO
 BE TEARING COMMUNITIES APART.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
AND RECENT VIOLENT RACIAL RIOTS
 IN SEVERAL BRITISH CITIES

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
HAVE SHOCKED MANY PEOPLE
 BY THE DEPTH OF POLARIZATION

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
BETWEEN THE ANGLO-SAXON
 MAJORITY AND ETHNIC MINORITIES.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
ALTHOUGH BRITISH
 POLITICIANS HAVE TRIED

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
TO RELEGATE IMMIGRATION
 TO THE MARGINS OF POLITICS

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
IT KEEPS CREEPING BACK
 TO THE CENTER,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
WITH EXTREMIST GROUPS
 MAKING POLITICAL CAPITAL

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
FROM FEAR OF IMMIGRANTS

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
AND TURNING RACIAL HATRED
 INTO VOTES.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
PEOPLE HAVE SAID,
"WE'VE HAD ENOUGH."

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
OUR VOTES HAVE GONE UP.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
WE'VE COME FROM NOWHERE
TO GET SIZEABLE VOTES NOW.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
THE BRITISH NATIONAL PARTY IS
 BECOMING MORE MAINSTREAM NOW.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
IT'S BECOMING--

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
IT'S BREAKING OUT
 OF THE FRINGES NOW,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
BECAUSE WE'RE STRIKING A NERVE
 WITH BRITISH VOTERS.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
WE BELIEVE THAT OTHER PARTIES--

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I BELIEVE THAT OTHER PARTIES
 HAVE LET THIS PEOPLE DOWN.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
ONLY THE BRITISH NATIONAL PARTY

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
HAS STRONGER POLICIES
ON IMMIGRATION.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
THERE ISN'T
THE SLIGHTEST EVIDENCE

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
THAT THE EXTREME
NATIONAL PARTIES

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
ARE ACTUALLY GAINING
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
THEY HAVE GAINED
IN OTHER COUNTRIES IN EUROPE,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
BUT HERE IN THE U.K.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE
AN INCREDIBLY MARGINAL IMPACT.

MOUNTING RACIAL TENSION
 LEFT ITS MENACING IMPRINT

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
ON THE BALLOT BOX
 IN THE LAST GENERAL ELECTION,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
WHERE THE EXTREME RIGHT
 BRITISH NATIONAL PARTY,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
THE B.N.P.,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
GAINED A SERIES
 OF REMARKABLE RESULTS

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
IN MANY AREAS OF LONDON.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
MAHMUD AL-RASHID: YOU KNOW,
 ONE WONDERS WHAT IT IS

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
ABOUT BRITISH SOCIETY
 AND BRITISH PEOPLE

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
THAT MAY LEAD THEM TO VOTE FOR
AN ORGANIZATION LIKE THE B.N.P.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
SO IT IS A BIT CONCERNING
FOR US.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
AND NOT JUST FOR MUSLIMS, BUT
I THINK FOR SOCIETY IN GENERAL.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
WELL, THERE IS THE...
BRITISH NATIONAL PARTY.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
THAT IS BRITISH.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
SO, LIKE THE NAZIS,
THEY NEVER LEFT.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
THEY JUST CHANGED THE NAME.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
...BRITISH?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN BRITISH.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
NARRATOR:
 EXTENSIVE STREET INTERVIEWS

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
THROUGHOUT LONDON
 REVEALED THE POTENTIAL

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
FOR SEVERE POLITICAL
 AND SOCIAL CONFLICTS

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
IN WHICH IMMIGRATION ISSUES

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
ARE LIKELY TO BE
 IN THE CENTER OF THE STORM.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
TODAY, A FULL THIRD

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
OF LONDON'S
 NINE MILLION INHABITANTS

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
ARE NON-ANGLO-SAXON.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
BECAUSE OF A LOW BIRTHRATE
 AND AN AGEING POPULATION,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
TO HELP FUEL
 ITS ECONOMIC GROWTH

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
AND FACE THE NEW CHALLENGES
 OF GLOBALIZATION,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
LONDON NEEDS SKILLED AND
 UNSKILLED FOREIGN MANPOWER.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
WE'RE NOT JUST
OPENING THE DOORS.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
INSTEAD OF HAVING
AN UNMANAGED SYSTEM

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
OF ILLEGAL MIGRATION,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
WE'LL HAVE A MANAGED SYSTEM
OF LEGAL MIGRATION.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
THAT, I THINK, IS THE THEORY.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
SO, THAT'S ALL, I THINK--
MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT IS THAT

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
THEY WILL ACTUALLY
 TRY AND LOOK AT

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
LABOR FORCE,
 LABOR MARKET REQUIREMENTS

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
AND JUDGE HOW MANY PEOPLE
 ARE NEEDED IN THE ECONOMY.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT
WE HAVE ENOUGH SKILLED WORKERS,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
ENOUGH TALENT, WITHIN
THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
YOU KNOW,
WE ARE SHORT OF DOCTORS,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
WE'RE SHORT OF TEACHERS,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
WE ARE SHORT OF SKILLED NURSES,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
YOU KNOW,
PROPER QUALIFIED NURSES.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
SO OBVIOUSLY,
WE NEED THE TALENT--

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
WELL-EDUCATED TEACHERS
AND NURSES AND DOCTORS

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
AND ALL THE I.T. SPECIALISTS.

AND IF THOSE SKILLS

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
COME FROM PEOPLE
 WHO ARE NOT BRITISH,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
FINE.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
IF THEY COME FROM PEOPLE
WHO ARE NOT EUROPEANS, FINE.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
WE SIMPLY WANT TO HAVE THE MIX--
THE RIGHT MIX OF SKILLS

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
THAT WILL ENABLE THIS COMPANY
TO PROSPER.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
CLARK:
 I'M NOT SURE WHETHER OR NOT

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
PEOPLE'S ACCESS OR OTHERWISE
TO THE LABOR MARKET

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
SHOULD BE DETERMINED ENTIRELY
BY BUSINESSMEN.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I'M NOT SURE THAT
ALL OF OUR POLICIES

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
HAVE TO BE DETERMINED
BY BUSINESS NEEDS.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I THINK THAT SOUNDS
VERY MUCH TO ME LIKE

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT
A TRADE UNIONIST TO SAY.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
IT'S ALL THE FAULT
OF THE BOSSES.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
MY PARTY TAKES THE VIEW

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
FIRST OF ALL
THAT RACISM IS ABHORRENT.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
SECONDLY,
THAT BRITAIN HISTORICALLY

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A COUNTRY
 WHICH RENEWED ITSELF

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
WITH NEW IMMIGRANTS
 FROM NEW COUNTRIES.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
NARRATOR: THE RACIAL
 AND CULTURAL MIX

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
OF PRESENT-DAY LONDON CERTAINLY
 REFLECTS ITS IMMIGRANT HISTORY.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
BUT AS ANY LONDONER
 WILL TELL YOU

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
THEIR MONGREL CITY
 IS STILL STRUGGLING

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
TO FIND A COMMON IDENTITY.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
WELL,
IT'S THE BRITISH WAY OF LIFE.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
I DON'T REALLY CARE.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
FOR ME, I THINK IT IS
HAVING A SENSE OF HUMOR,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
WHICH WE HAVE.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
THE SATIRE WHICH EXISTS.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
THE...
THE FREEDOM WHICH WE HAVE.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
THE ABILITY TO DISCUSS OPENLY,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
TO BE CRITICAL,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
BUT TO BE ABLE TO ALSO
TAKE CRITICISM AS WELL.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
INTERVIEWER: DO YOU THINK
 THERE IS SUCH A THING

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
AS THE BRITISH WAY OF LIFE?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
UH...

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
NO, NOT REALLY.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
NOT ANYMORE.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
NOTHING NOW. [LAUGHS]

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
THE BRITISH WAY OF LIFE

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
IS TO BE A GOOD,
UPHOLDING CITIZEN, I SUPPOSE.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
NARRATOR:
 MOST SECOND OR THIRD GENERATION

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
ETHNIC MINORITY LONDONERS

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
EXHIBIT A DEEP SENSE
 OF BELONGING TO BRITAIN.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
HOWEVER, SPEAKING ENGLISH
 AND INTEGRATING

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
DOES NOT SEEM TO PREVENT
 DIFFERENT TREATMENT

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
DUE TO RACIAL OR
 RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
FEMALE INTERVIEWER: YOU LOOK
 DIFFERENT, YOU ARE DIFFERENT.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
HAVE YOU EVER ENCOUNTERED
 DISCRIMINATION?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
AH, IT'S EVERYWHERE.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
LIKE LOOKING FOR JOBS...

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
OR GOING TO PARTIES, CLUBS.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
YEAH, I'VE BEEN
DISCRIMINATED DIFFERENT TIMES,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
MAYBE BECAUSE SOMETIMES
THEY LOOK DOWN ON US,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
AND I KNOW THAT
THEY DON'T REALLY TREAT US

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
AS GOOD AS ONE OF THEM.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
WE'VE TRIED-- WE'RE TRYING.
WE'RE STILL TRYING...

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
TO FIT INTO THE SOCIETY.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
BUT IF THEY'RE STILL
PUSHING US OUT,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
WE'RE STILL
GONNA KEEP TRYING.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
YOU GROW UP WITH IT,
SO YOU COME TO ACCEPT IT.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
AND IT'S JUST...
WATER OFF A DUCK'S BACK.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
"ISLAMOPHOBIA,"
THIS IS A NEW TERM

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
THAT'S BEEN COINED
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
AND IT'S A TERM
THAT'S COME ABOUT

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN
A MARKED--

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
NOT JUST A MARKED INCREASE,
BUT CERTAINLY A MARKED INCIDENCE

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
OF MUSLIMS BEING DISCRIMINATED
 AGAINST IN THE WORKPLACE

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
AND FOR NO OTHER REASON
 OTHER THAN THEY ARE MUSLIM.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
AS A BRITISH MUSLIM

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I FEEL VERY PROUD
TO BE BRITISH AND MUSLIM.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
THERE'S NO--
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
THERE'S NO CONFLICT IN THAT.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
WHAT IS A MATTER OF FACT,
THAT SINCE 11th OF SEPTEMBER

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
THERE HAS BEEN GREATER PRESSURE
ON THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
TO COME OUT AND
OPPOSE AND CONDEMN TERRORISM,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
AND TO PROVE THEMSELVES
 TIME AND TIME AFTER

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
THAT WE ARE BRITISH AND
 OUR LOYALTIES ARE WITH BRITAIN.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
NARRATOR:
 THE TERRORIST ATTACKS

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
ON NEW YORK CITY
 ON SEPTEMBER 11th

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
PRECIPITATED A WORSENING
 SITUATION IN RELATIONS

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
BETWEEN LONDON'S HALF A MILLION
 MUSLIM POPULATION

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
AND ITS WHITE COUNTERPARTS.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
GURBUX SINGH: WE ALSO SAW
 SOME PRETTY DREADFUL REACTIONS

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
TO THE EVENTS FOLLOWING ON
 FROM SEPTEMBER 11th.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
ASSAULTS WERE MADE
 AGAINST PEOPLE

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
SIMPLY BECAUSE
 THEY LOOKED DIFFERENT.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
PEOPLE WERE PHYSICALLY
ASSAULTED, I MEAN...

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
THERE ARE TOO MANY
SAD CASES OF--

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
AN AFGHAN TAXI DRIVER
HERE IN LONDON

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
WHO WAS BRUTALLY ATTACKED
AND WHO WAS THEN PARALYZED.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
A 19-YEAR-OLD WOMAN IN SWINDON,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
MERELY BECAUSE SHE WAS DRESSED
AS A MUSLIM WOMAN,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
WAS ATTACKED BY WHITE YOUTHS
WITH BASEBALL BATS.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
RACISM IS A PROBLEM
IN BRITAIN STILL.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
BUT WHAT IS SURPRISING,
AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
IS THAT ALTHOUGH RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION IS OUTLAWED,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
IS PROHIBITED,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION
IS STILL PERMISSIBLE.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
YES. SO YOU CAN BE SACKED,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
DISMISSED FROM YOUR EMPLOYMENT,
 BECAUSE OF YOUR RELIGION.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
AND YOU HAVE NO RECOURSE TO LAW.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
THAT IS LAWFUL DISCRIMINATION.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY
FOR ABOUT 30 YEARS,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
AND I CONSIDER THIS COUNTRY
AS MY OWN ONE,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
AND I AM VERY MUCH
USED TO THIS SOCIETY--

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
USED TO LIVING IN THIS SOCIETY

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
IN THE SAME WAY
AS THE ENGLISH PEOPLE LIVE.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
AND I... STILL, I KEEP
MY OWN IDENTITY AS A MUSLIM.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
AND I COME TO PRAY IN HERE,
IN THIS MOSQUE,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
EVERY FRIDAY
 AND SOME OTHER DAYS AS WELL.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
[MAN RECITING MUSLIM PRAYER]

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
NARRATOR:
 IN ISLAM, RELIGION IS NOT,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
AS IT IS IN CHRISTIANITY,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
ONE SEGMENT OF LIFE
 REGULATING SOME MATTERS

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
WHILE OTHERS ARE EXCLUDED.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
IT IS CONCERNED
 WITH THE WHOLE OF LIFE.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
AS A PERSONAL RELIGIOUS FAITH,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
ISLAM IS BOTH VERY ARDUOUS
 AND VERY EASY TO PURSUE.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
IT MAKES SEVERE DEMANDS
 ON THE BELIEVER,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
STOPPING EVERYTHING
 TO PRAY FIVE TIMES A DAY,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
FASTING FOR A MONTH
 DURING RAMADAN.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
BUT MUSLIMS
 ARE NOT REQUIRED TO RUN

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
CHRISTIANITY'S NEVER-ENDING
 SPIRITUAL OBSTACLE COURSE.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
IT IS A FAITH OF CERTAINTIES,
 NOT DOUBTS.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
THERE ARE GOOD MUSLIMS
 AND BAD MUSLIMS,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
BUT THERE ARE NO
 SKEPTICAL MUSLIMS.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
ANYBODY CAN BE A MUSLIM.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I THINK, IN FACT,
WE DO FIND THAT, YOU KNOW,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
THE MUSLIMS IN THE WEST ARE NOT
JUST THE ASIANS OR THE ARABS,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
BUT THEY COME FROM
ALL WALKS OF LIFE,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
AND ALL KINDS OF COMMUNITIES
 AND BACKGROUNDS.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
AND I THINK ALSO THAT THERE ARE
 LOTS OF "NATIVE MUSLIMS,"

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
IF YOU LIKE,
 WHO HAVE CONVERTED INTO ISLAM.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
NARRATOR:
 IF IT IS TRUE THAT ISLAM

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
IS PRIMARILY A WAY OF LIFE
 HANDED DOWN IN RELIGIOUS LAWS,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
A WAY OF LIFE
 WHOSE AUTHORITY COMES FROM

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
THE UNDIMINISHED,
 UNQUESTIONED WORD OF GOD,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
MUSLIMS IN THE WEST
 FACE A TOUGH FUTURE.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT
WESTERN VALUES

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
IN TERMS OF
RIDDING PUBLIC LIFE FROM

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
ANY CORRELATION TO SPIRITUALITY

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
OR ANY INVOLVEMENT OF GOD IN
YOUR POLITICAL DECISION-MAKING,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
OR ECONOMIC DECISION-MAKING
OR SOCIAL LIFE,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
THEN MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
HERE THAT'S A BIT OF A PROBLEM.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
[SHOUTING]

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
NARRATOR: MANY LONDONERS
 ARE BEGINNING TO WORRY

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
THAT THEIR CITY
 IS BECOMING A BATTLEGROUND

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
OF THE WARRING IDEOLOGIES
 OF MODERNIZATION

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
AND POLITICIZED ISLAM.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
YOUNG MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALISTS
 TRYING TO MOBILIZE

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
ISLAM'S RELIGIOUS YEARNING
 FOR SALVATION

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
AND PROJECTING IT IN POLITICS,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
ARE A COMMON SIGHT WITHIN
 SEVERAL MOSQUES IN LONDON.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
THE MOSQUES
 HAVE MANY PIOUS BELIEVERS

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
WHO COME FOR PRAYERS
 A FEW TIMES A DAY,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
AND THEN HEAD BACK TO WORK
 IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
BUT ALSO PRESENT IS A CORE
 OF MOSTLY UNEMPLOYED YOUNG MEN

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
WHO SPEND THEIR DAYS
 AT THE MOSQUE

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
CHANNELING THEIR FRUSTRATION
 INTO POLITICS AND RELIGION.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
THERE ARE MUSLIM GROUPS
THAT ARTICULATE

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
AN INTOLERANT AND
EXTREME FORM OF ISLAM,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
AND THESE ARE GROUPS
WHO WILL NECESSARILY

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
EXPRESS SOME KIND OF
CONDEMNATION

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
OF THE WAY WESTERN SOCIETIES
ARE ORGANIZED

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
AND WILL ARGUE THAT ISLAM
 CANNOT RESIDE HAPPILY

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
WITH EUROPEAN
 OR WESTERN VALUES.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
RACIAL CONFLICT,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
PARTICULARLY RELIGIOUS
CONFLICT IN THIS COUNTRY,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
HAS COME FROM MUSLIM AREAS,
 HEAVILY MUSLIM AREAS,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
AND THIS WAS PRETTY MUCH
THE CASE BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11th.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
MUSLIMS IN THIS COUNTRY,
THE DESCENDANTS, THE YOUNG KIDS,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
ARE FEELING THEY WANT
THEIR OWN IDENTITY NOW,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
AND IT CAN BE QUITE AN
AGGRESSIVE WAY OF EXPRESSION.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
AL-RASHID: THAT'S NOT TRUE.
 THAT IS NOT TRUE.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
YES, SOME PEOPLE TRY TO
BLAME THE ISLAMIC UPBRINGING

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
OR THE ISLAMIC EDUCATION.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS,
THESE BOYS--

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
AND MUSLIM ARE BOYS,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE
ISLAMIC EDUCATION,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
OR VERY LITTLE
ISLAMIC UNDERSTANDING,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
BECAUSE IF THEY HAD,
THEY WOULD NOT BEHAVE LIKE THAT.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
WE FOUND THAT THE MEDIA WAS ONLY
INTERESTED IN NEGATIVE NEWS,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
EVEN TODAY, AND IT WAS,
AND IT IS STILL, ISLAMOPHOBIC

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
IN THE WAY IT REPORTS
 ABOUT MUSLIM ISSUES.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
I'LL ILLUSTRATE
 WITH AN EXAMPLE:

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
FOR INSTANCE, THERE'S A SMALL
 GROUP CALLED AL-MUHAJIROUN.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
THEY HAD A DIFFERENT VIEW
ON THE TERRORIST ATTACK,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
AT LEAST THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
WHILE OVERWHELMINGLY,
I MEAN, I THINK UNANIMOUSLY,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY
IN THIS COUNTRY,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
WHO ARE TWO MILLION,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
CONDEMNED THIS ATROCITY.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
AND THE MEDIA,
 RATHER THAN USING--

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
COVERING THE STORY WITH
 THE MAJORITY OF THE MUSLIMS'

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
OR MOST OF THE MUSLIMS'
 OPINION ON THIS ISSUE,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
THEY ONLY TARGETED
 THIS SMALL GROUP,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
AND THEY GAVE THEM
 SO MUCH PROMINENCE

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
AS IF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY
WAS SUPPORTING

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW YORK.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
I THINK THESE MUSLIM COMMUNITIES
AROUND THE WESTERN WORLD

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
HAVE A LOT TO LEARN
ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
TO PERSUADE
THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
OF THEIR GOODWILL
TOWARD THEIR HOST COUNTRIES.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
I CHOOSE MY WORDS WITH CARE
BECAUSE, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
TO POINT OUT THAT THE PRESS,
A FREE PRESS,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
IS LIKELY TO ONLY RECORD THE
VIEWS OF THE YOUNG EXTREMISTS

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
IS NOTHING NEW.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
WE ARE ALL AWARE OF HOW
THE PRESS REPORTS WHAT GOES ON.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
WHAT THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
IS THAT IF THEY WANT TO CHANGE
THE PERCEPTION OF THE COMMUNITY

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
AWAY FROM TWO OR THREE
SENIOR CLERICS

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
WHO SAY
VERY INFLAMMATORY THINGS,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
AND AWAY FROM HALF A DOZEN

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
OR EVEN A COUPLE OF DOZEN
 YOUNG MEN

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
WHO WANT TO GO OFF
 AND FIGHT FOR AL-QAEDA,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
IF THEY WANT TO CONCENTRATE ON

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
THE MAINSTREAM VALUES
OF THE COMMUNITY,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
THEY MUST UNDERSTAND THAT
THIS IS A TWO-WAY PROCESS.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
THEY MUST NOT SIMPLY
BLAME THE MEDIA.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
NARRATOR: INTEGRATING
 INTO A MULTICULTURAL LONDON

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
WILL REQUIRE MOVEMENT
 BY ALL PARTIES.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
AND IT COMES AT A TIME WHEN
 PEOPLE IN MANY AREAS OF LONDON

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
HAVE RETREATED
 BEHIND ETHNIC LINES.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
DIVERSITY CAN BE
 A SOURCE OF STRENGTH,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
VITALITY AND PRIDE.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
BUT IS THERE A CONTRADICTION

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
BETWEEN RETAINING
 A DISTINCT CULTURAL IDENTITY

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
AND FEELING A SENSE
 OF BELONGING IN BRITAIN?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
NO, THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION.
THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
YOU CAN FIND A BALANCE,
YOU'LL FIND A WAY.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
NO, I COULD NEVER BECOME
BRITISH. I'M AFRICAN.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
AFTER TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD BE
INTEGRATED TOTALLY

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
WITHIN THE SOCIETY
WHERE THEY HAVE DECIDED TO LIVE.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
FOR THE KIDS
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE TO
TRY AND IDENTIFY THEMSELVES

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
WITH BEING ENGLISH.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
YOU ABIDE BY BRITISH WAYS,
BUT YOU CAN'T BECOME THAT.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
IT'S LIKE, HOW CAN A LIZARD
BECOME A SNAKE?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
I WAS BROUGHT UP
IN A TOTALLY BRITISH WAY.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
TOTALLY ENGLISH.
NO FOREIGN OR NO--

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
DIDN'T HAVE ANY INFLUENCES FROM
EITHER PARENT, IN ACTUAL FACT,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT
FROM MY MOTHER,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
WHICH SHE'S
FAIRLY UPSET ABOUT.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
* LET ME TELL YOU
'BOUT A GIRL I KNOW

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
* SHE'S MY BABY
AND SHE LIVES NEXT DOOR

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
* EVERY MORNING
 'FORE THE SUN COMES UP

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
* SHE BRING MY COFFEE
 IN MY FAVORITE CUP

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
* THAT'S WHY I KNOW
 YES, I KNOW

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
* HALLELUJAH
 I JUST LOVE HER SO

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
* WHEN I'M IN TROUBLE
AND I HAVE NO FRIEND

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
* I KNOW SHE'LL GO WITH ME
UNTIL THE END

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
* EVERYBODY ASKS ME
 HOW I KNOW

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
* I SMILE AT THEM AND SAY
 SHE TOLD ME SO

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
* THAT'S WHY I KNOW
YES, I KNOW

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
* HALLELUJAH
I JUST LOVE HER SO

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
* IF I CALL HER
 ON THE TELEPHONE

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
* AND I TELL HER
 THAT I'M ALL ALONE

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
* BY THE TIME I COUNT
 FROM ONE TO FOUR

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
* I HEAR HER
 ON MY DOOR

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
* IN THE EVENING
 WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
* I SAY HALLELUJAH

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
* I JUST LOVE THAT WOMAN SO

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
[MUSIC ENDS]

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
DO YOU THINK
THAT THE IMMIGRANTS

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
ARE ALSO CHANGING
THE FACE OF LONDON?

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
I'M AFRAID SO.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
NO. LONDON'S ALWAYS
BEEN COSMOPOLITAN.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
AND WHY NOT?

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
IT HAS ENOUGH ROOM
FOR EVERYBODY.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
I THINK THEY ENHANCE US
IN MANY WAYS, YOU KNOW?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
AND I THINK THE MORE CULTURES
YOU GET, THE BETTER IT IS.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
LONDON IS AN OPEN CITY.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
IT IS A CITY OF TOLERANCE,
OF LOVE AND OF PEACE.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
NARRATOR:
 MANY LONDONERS WOULD DISAGREE

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
WITH THIS CHEERFUL ASSESSMENT
 OF THEIR CITY.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
BUT WITHOUT A DOUBT,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
MOST OF THEM
 WOULD AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
THAT LONDON TODAY
 IS TRULY MULTICULTURAL.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
BEHIND THE VOGUE
 FOR CULTURAL DIVERSITY

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
IS THE GREATER AVAILABILITY
 OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
IMPORTED FROM AROUND THE WORLD.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
MANY LONDON GROCERS
 RECEIVE FRESH AIR FREIGHT

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
AT LEAST FOUR TIMES A WEEK.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
THIS TREND REFLECTS

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
NOT ONLY THE INFUSION
 OF NEW ETHNICITIES

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
BUT A DRAMATIC CHANGE

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
IN WHAT LONDONERS
 CONSIDER THEIR NATIONAL DISH.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
OUR GREATEST DISH NOW,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
AFTER ROAST BEEF
AND YORKSHIRE PUDDING,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
IS ACTUALLY THE CURRY.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
I THINK IT CHANGES.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
I THINK WE GET
FLAVOR OF THE MONTH.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
AT THE MOMENT
I THINK THAI CUISINE IS IN.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
CURRY IS BRITISH NATIONAL DISH.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
AND CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA
IS ESPECIALLY MADE IN BRITAIN,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
SO THIS ONE
IS NOT IN INDIA EITHER.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
WE LOVE IT.
WE LOVE CURRY.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
I COULD EAT CURRY EVERY DAY.
FOR BREAKFAST, FOR DINNER,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
FOR LUNCH.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
NARRATOR:
 DEFINITELY GUARANTEED.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
FOR LONDONERS TODAY,
 CURRY IS THEIR NATIONAL DISH.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
AND TO SATISFY A HUGE
 APPETITE FOR THE SPICY TREAT,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
JUST IN "BANGLATOWN,"

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
THE HEART OF LONDON'S
 BANGLADESHI COMMUNITY,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
WE FIND MORE THAN
 100 CURRY RESTAURANTS.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
BUT IN LONDON, YOU CAN
 EAT YOUR WAY AROUND THE WORLD.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
YOU CAN GO TO DIFFERENT
COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
BUT YOU CAN ONLY GET CERTAIN--
PROBABLY THEIR CUISINE.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
BUT IF YOU COME TO LONDON,
YOU CAN GET EVERYBODY'S CUISINE.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
AND IT'S A MULTICULTURAL MIX.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
HUSSAIN: I'M STARTING
 A RESTAURANT SCHOOL FOR CHEFS.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
BUT I'M ALREADY TRAINING PEOPLE

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
EVERY MONDAY TO KNOW HOW
 TO MAKE INDIAN CURRY.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000
JUST BRITISH LOCAL PEOPLE
OR EVEN INDIANS COME HERE

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
AND LEARN HOW TO MAKE
LESS FAT CURRY.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
AND WE USE BRITISH...
 EVERYTHING.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
VEGETARIAN,
 CHICKEN AND THE MEAT.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
SO THIS IS BRITISH CURRY.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
SINGH: I'M A HUGE SUPPORTER
 OF MULTICULTURALISM.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
DIFFERENT CULTURES COMING
TOGETHER, ENRICHING SOCIETY,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
WITH NOBODY SAYING,
"THIS IS THE DOMINANT CULTURE."

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
AND NOBODY SAYING,
"THIS IS WHAT WE WILL DICTATE

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
"ON OTHER PEOPLE."

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
IT'S ENABLING PEOPLE
TO DO THEIR OWN THING,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
BUT SEEING THEMSELVES
AS PART OF BRITAIN.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
THAT IS MY VISION
 OF MULTICULTURALISM.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
MY FATHER'S GREEK,
MY MOTHER'S ENGLISH,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
AND IF YOU SIT DOWN
AND TALK TO PEOPLE,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
YOU-- AUTOMATICALLY,
YOU GET COMMON GROUND,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
WHERE THE PERSON
YOU'RE TALKING TO SAYS,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
"OH, I'M HALF INDIAN
AND HALF ENGLISH,"

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
OR HALF THIS OR HALF THAT.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
I DON'T THINK YOU ACTUALLY
 GET MANY PEOPLE IN LONDON,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
OR WHO WORK IN LONDON, WHO
 ARE ACTUALLY ONE NATIONALITY.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
YOU HAVE SO MANY MIXTURES.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
WHO'S A LONDONER NOW?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
I SUSPECT IF
YOU LOOKED AT YOUNG PEOPLE,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
IT MIGHT WELL BE SOMEBODY
WHO WAS NOT ACTUALLY--

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
WHOSE FAMILY WERE NOT BORN
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
WHO DIDN'T COME
TO THE UNITED KINGDOM

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
UNTIL THE LAST 50 YEARS.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
DOES THAT MAKE ME
ANY LESS A LONDONER?

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
BOTH:
HELLO! WELCOME TO LONDON!

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
WELCOME TO LONDON.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
BOTH:
WELCOME TO LONDON, MATE.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
WELCOME TO LONDON.
ENJOY YOURSELF.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
WELCOME TO LONDON.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
BOTH: WELCOME TO LONDON.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
YOU HAVE A NICE STAY HERE.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
