THE ENVIRONMENT

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.200
THIS IS SOMETHING
FEW PEOPLE DOUBT.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.730
THE EARTH, THE AIR AND
THE SEA ON OUR PLANET

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.000

OF UNPREDICTABLE
CONSEQUENCES.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.460
HOWEVER, IS THIS A
HOMOGENEOUS PROCESS?

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.330
DOES THE ENVIRONMENT

THE CONSEQUENCES OF
ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.960
IN THE SAME WAY THAT
PEOPLE IN CAMBODIA DO?

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.360

UNCONTROLLED PROGRESS.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.900
THE CONSEQUENCES OF
UNSCRUPULOUS DEVELOPMENT

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.560
UNCHECKED BY PRAGMATIC
FORWARD-LOOKING PLANNING,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.330
ARE CONVERTING THE POOREST
POPULATIONS ON THE PLANET

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.400

UNQUESTIONABLY INCREASED
MANKIND'S MATERIAL

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.560
PROGRESS, IT HAS ALSO
HAD ITS DOWN SIDE.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.930
WHAT DO WE DO WITH ALL THE
JUNK, THE SCRAP METAL,

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.500
REFUSE AND PLETHORA
OF CAUSTIC BYPRODUCTS

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.930
OUR INDUSTRIOUSNESS
ALSO RENDERS?

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.730
NOT MANY PEOPLE WORRIED
ABOUT THIS AT FIRST.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.330
EARTH SEEMED INFINITE,
MORE THAN CAPABLE OF

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.600
COPING WITH A LITTLE
DETRITUS HERE AND THERE

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.930
AND A BIT OF SOOT.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.860
BUT OF COURSE WE NOW KNOW
THAT OUR BELOVED PLANET

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.960
IS NOT AS INDESTRUCTIBLE
AS WE THOUGHT IT WAS.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.960
MANAGING THE DESTRUCTIVE
EFFECTS OF HUMAN ACTIVITY

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.130
AND THE ACCUMULATION
OF WASTE PRODUCTS

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.460
IS NO LONGER CONSIDERED
JUST A SILLY ANECDOTE.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.460
IN THE 20TH CENTURY, THE
CHEMICAL, STEEL AND NAVAL

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.160
INDUSTRIES, TO NAME BUT A
FEW, BECAME SO PERVASIVELY

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.500
LARGE AND INDISPENSABLE
THAT THE NATURE

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.660
AND SHEER QUANTITY
OF THEIR WASTE PRODUCTS

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.630
COULD HARDLY
BE IGNORED.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.960
HOW WOULD THIS THORNY
ISSUE BE MANAGED?

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.130
IN THE END THE SOLUTION
SEEMED SIMPLE.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.230
SELL THE GARBAGE
TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.330
AFTER ALL, THERE
ARE LOTS OF COUNTRIES

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.200
BETWEEN A ROCK AND A
HARD PLACE THAT WOULD

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.600
GLADLY TAKE YOUR
CASH AND YOUR JUNK.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.360
WHICH IS PERFECTLY
FINE, OF COURSE,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.030
FOR THAT'S THE WAY
THE WORLD GOES ROUND.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.200
A PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE
BUSINESS DEAL,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.060
CAVEAT EMPTOR.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.760
HOWEVER, THIS PARTICULAR
KIND OF BUSINESS SOMETIMES

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.260
GETS MORE COMPLICATED,
DISTURBING EVEN,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.000
FOR WHEN THE WASTE PRODUCTS
IN QUESTION INCLUDE

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.730
CERTAIN CHEMICAL
PRODUCTS OR TOXIC WASTE,

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.960
SUDDENLY INNOCENT PEOPLES'
LIVES ARE PUT AT RISK.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.860
IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED THAT
MANY POTENTIALLY HARMFUL

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.760
INDUSTRIAL BYPRODUCTS ARE
REGULARLY TRANSPORTED,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.130
CHEMICALLY TREATED,
AND STORED UNDER

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.960
REMARKABLY LAX
SECURITY CONDITIONS.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.100
AND THIS DESPITE THE FACT
THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.400
OF AFRICANS AND ASIANS
HAVE SUFFERED DISEASE

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.900
AND DEATH AS A
DIRECT RESULT OF

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.430
CURRENT GLOBAL
INDUSTRIAL WASTE POLICY.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.700
IT'S A STATUS QUO THAT
IS SOLIDLY UNDERPINNED

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.760
BY INTERNATIONAL LAW
AND THINGS ARE ONLY

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.930
GETTING WORSE
DECADE BY DECADE.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.700
OVER 130 MILLION CELL
PHONES ARE SIMPLY

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.030
THROWN AWAY EVERY YEAR
JUST IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.560
BY 2007 THERE WILL BE 700
MILLION OBSOLETE COMPUTERS.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.460
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF REFRIGERATORS,

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.760
AIR CONDITIONERS, TAPE
DECKS, AND ALL KINDS OF

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.960
OTHER HOUSEHOLD
APPLIANCES ARE DISCARDED

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.300
EVERY SINGLE DAY
AROUND THE GLOBE.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.330
WHEN SOMEONE THROWS OUT
AN OLD COMPUTER OR CELL

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
PHONE, DIGITAL CAMERA,
ELECTRONIC DATE BOOK, ETC,

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.700
HEAVY METALS LIKE LEAD,
MERCURY AND CADMIUM

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.600
GO ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.930
IF NOT PROPERLY TREATED,
COMPONENT MATERIALS

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.000
OF THIS TYPE POSE VERY
SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.930
AND ENVIRONMENTAL
ISSUES.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.560
COMPUTER SCREENS,
FOR EXAMPLE,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.100
CONTAIN PARTICULARLY
LARGE AMOUNTS OF LEAD.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.630
IN EUROPE, AS IN THE
UNITED STATES, 80% OF

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.260
ALL ELECTRONIC WASTE IS
SHIPPED OFF TO AFRICA

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.830
OR ASIA TO BE DISMANTLED
AND FURTHER TREATED.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.760
OFTEN SIMPLY BURNED IN
OPEN AIR PITS OR THROWN

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.700
INTO ACID BATHS WHOSE
RUNOFF THEN POLLUTES

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.000
RICE FIELDS AND
RIVERS THAT PROVIDE

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.860
DRINKING WATER
TO RURAL AREAS.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.930
THESE INAPPROPRIATE REFUSE
TREATMENT PRACTICES

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.400
HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO CAUSE
RESPIRATORY AND STOMACH

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.560
DISEASES THAT RESULT
IN CHRONIC SUFFERING

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.300
FOR VICTIMS
AND EVEN DEATH.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.860
A GREAT NUMBER OF WORKERS
EMPLOYED IN THESE KINDS

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.660
OF JOBS IN POOR COUNTRIES
ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.730
WHOSE HANDS ARE
QUICKER AND CHEAPER.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.300
THE AMOUNT OF WASTE
THAT IS TRANSPORTED TO

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.400
THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES
IS INCREASING AT SUCH A

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.360
HIGH RATE THAT
THE EUROPEAN UNION

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.830
HAS EFFECTIVELY
BANNED THE TRAFFIC.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.330
BUT THIS DOESN'T
MEAN THAT IT STOPPED.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:09.200
ON THE CONTRARY, IT HAS
CONTINUED TO INCREASE.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.500
COMPANIES DON'T SEND
THEIR WASTE PRODUCTS,

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.800
FOR EXAMPLE, TO BE
ELIMINATED ANYMORE

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.500
BUT TO BE RECYCLED.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.730
OFFICIALLY SPEAKING, SUCH
PRODUCTS ARE EXPORTED

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.700
SO THEIR BASE COMPONENTS
AND TRACE ELEMENTS

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.560
CAN BE RECOVERED.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.630
HOWEVER, IN FACT, THIS
IS AN ERSATZ RECYCLING

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.430
PROCESS, FOR THIS
REFUSE IS ACTUALLY

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.860
SIMPLY INCINERATED OR
BURIED JUST LIKE BEFORE.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.130
A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THIS
IS HOW SHIPPING VESSELS

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.000
ARE SCRAPPED.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
MOST OF THEM ARE 80%
STEEL WHICH CAN BE SOLD

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.130
AND RE-USED AS SCRAP
METAL WHILE OTHER

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.300
MORE VALUABLE COMPONENTS
CAN ALSO BE RECYCLED.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.460
BUT AN OLD MEDIUM SIZED
SHIP, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.700
ALSO CONTAINS NEARLY
5% TOXIC COMPONENTS

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.430
REQUIRING SOPHISTICATED
WASTE TREATMENT.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.360
THIS SITUATION ON A
GLOBAL SCALE CONSTITUTES

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.400
A VERY DANGEROUS
SOURCE OF TOXIC WASTE.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.200
VESSELS ARE OFTEN SCRAPPED
ON BEACHES OR NEAR

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.530
RIVERBANKS AND SPILL
THEIR TOXIC SUBSTANCES

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.800
ON THE GROUND
AND IN THE SEA.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.960
THIS INDUSTRY IS
CONSIDERED ONE OF THE

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.330
DEADLIEST IN
THE WORLD.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.460
WORKERS DISMANTLE SHIPS
WITH THEIR BARE HANDS

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.030
AND SOME 25% OF
THEM WILL GET CANCER

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:08.200
FROM BREATHING
ASBESTOS DUST.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.500
OVER 100,000 WORKERS
DISMANTLING OLD SHIPS

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:18.860
IN ASIA ALONE ARE DIRECTLY
EXPOSED TO SUCH POISONS.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.530
COMMUNITIES LIVING NEARBY
THESE FALSE RECYCLING

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.460
FACILITIES ARE ALSO
AFFECTED BY THE POLLUTION

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:42.830
AND DISEASES CAUSED BY
EXPOSURE TO TOXIC SUBSTANCES.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:47.730
IN THE YEAR 2002, THE
BASEL CONVENTION ADOPTED

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.900
CERTAIN DIRECTIVES
IN WHICH SUITABLE

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.060
PROCEDURES AND
PRACTICES WERE DETAILED

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.830
REGARDING THE
DECOMMISSIONING

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.030
AND SCRAPPING OF
OBSOLETE VESSELS.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.030
THE DIRECTIVES
DISCUSS DISMANTLING,

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.260
THE CLASSIFICATION OF PARTS,
THE IDENTIFICATION

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.400
OF ANY POSSIBLE
CONTAMINATING ELEMENTS

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.800
AND THE PREVENTION
OF TOXIC SPILLS,

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.360
BUT IT'S A NON
BINDING DOCUMENT.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.160
ITS DIRECTIVES ARE
SIMPLY GUIDELINES.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.360
IN 2003, THE INTERNATIONAL
LABOR ORGANIZATION

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.200
AGREED ON CERTAIN
GUIDELINES

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.200
HAVING TO DO WITH
WORKING CONDITIONS

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.330
DURING THE DISMANTLING
OF OBSOLETE VESSELS,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.260
AND THESE TOO
ARE SIMPLY VOLUNTARY.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.130
AS ONE MIGHT
EXPECT, NEITHER THE

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.330
BASEL CONVENTION
OR THE ILO RULES

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.900
CAN BOAST OF ANY
COMPLIANCE TO SPEAK OF.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.800
TRANS-NATIONAL COMPANIES
MAY ACT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.860
DEPENDING ON WHETHER
THEY'RE DEALING WITH A

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.200
DEVELOPED COUNTRY WITH
STRICT ENVIRONMENTAL AND

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.600
HEALTHCARE PROTECTION
RULES OR WITH A DEVELOPING

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.900
COUNTRY WITH NO PROTECTION
IN THIS AREA WHATSOEVER.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.400
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF
KNOWN CASES OVER THE LAST

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.800
FEW YEARS IN WHICH
COMPANIES HAVE INFLICTED

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.500
GREAT HARM IN DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES AND HAVEN'T BEEN

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.300
MADE TO PAY THE
CONSEQUENCES YET.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.730
IN SOUTH AFRICA, FOR
EXAMPLE, THOR CHEMICALS,

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.400
THIS COMPANY CLOSED ITS
ASBESTOS FACTORIES IN THE

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.860
UNITED KINGDOM BY WAY OF
LEGAL MEDIATION FROM THE

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.860
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH,
SOCIAL SERVICES

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.200
AND PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.130
HOWEVER, IT CONTINUED
TO WORK AT ITS

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.360
SOUTH AFRICAN FACTORY
FOR 20 YEARS MORE,

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.960
CAUSING MANY CASES OF
DISEASE AND/OR DEATH

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.960
AND SERIOUS DAMAGE
TO THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.300
IN THIS CASE, AS
IN SO MANY OTHERS,

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.330
THE COMPANY ANSWERS ONLY
TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.000
THE SHAREHOLDERS IN
TURN JUDGE A COMPANY'S

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.100
ACCOMPLISHMENTS BY
ITS FINANCIAL HEALTH

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.960
AND RETURNS
OF DIVIDENDS.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.200
IN SHORT, THERE ARE NO
EFFECTIVE LAWS THAT CAN

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.400
ASSURE A MINIMUM OF
ETHICAL CONSIDERATION

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.630
TOWARDS PEOPLE AND THE
ENVIRONMENT IN REGIONS

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.800
SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE
RESIDENCES OF BOTH THE

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.900
SHAREHOLDERS AND THE
COMPANY EXECUTIVES

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.500
RESPONSIBLE FOR
THIS SITUATION.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.300
REGARDING THE TRANSPORTING
OF WASTE PRODUCTS,

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.600
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE
THAT THE AREAS EVENTUALLY

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.500
AFFECTED ARE ALMOST
ALWAYS DISINHERITED ONES.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.560
THE PEOPLE AFFECTED
ARE ALMOST ALWAYS

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.600
THE LEAST AWARE OF
THE RISKS THEY RUN

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.130
AND THE RIGHTS
THEY MAY HAVE.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.800
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS,
GENERALLY ACCEPTED FOR

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.130
ALL HUMAN BEINGS, ARE
CLEARLY PUT AT STAKE.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.760
THE RIGHT TO LIFE, HEALTH,
PROPER NOURISHMENT,

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.930
DECENT WORKING
CONDITIONS, ETC.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.760
IF WE CONTINUE TO
ACCEPT THE STATUS QUO,

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.360
IF WE CONTINUE TO
BE ACCOMPLICES,

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:07.230
AREN'T WE ALL RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE CONSEQUENCES?

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.200
THE USE OF CHEMICAL
PRODUCTS HAS INCREASED

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.530
OVER THE LAST
FEW DECADES.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.030
THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY
CONSTITUTES A VERY

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.400
IMPORTANT PART OF
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY -

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.400
SOME 9% OF ALL
INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.230
80% OF THIS INDUSTRY'S
PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED IN

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:40.230
INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES
WHILE NO LESS THAN 90% OF

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.760
THE RESULTING DANGEROUS
RESIDUES END UP IN

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.030
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.160
RURAL AND INHABITED
BY THE COMMUNITIES

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.630
MOST UNPREPARED TO COPE
WITH THE OFTEN PERILOUS

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:55.330
CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH ONE
SIDED INDUSTRIAL TRANSFER.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.730
WITHIN THE
CHEMICAL INDUSTRY

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.200
PESTICIDES CONTINUE TO BE
THE MOST DANGEROUS PRODUCTS

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.260
- THOSE WITH THE
POTENTIAL TO CAUSE

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.400
INTOXICATIONS ON
AN EPIDEMIC SCALE.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.760
EACH YEAR THERE ARE THREE
MILLION RECORDED CASES

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.830
OF PEOPLE SUFFERING
SEVERE INTOXICATION

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:44.630
FROM PESTICIDES, OF
WHICH 200,000 DIE.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.830
99% OF THESE CASES

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:52.030
ARE RECORDED IN
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:15:01.530
WHY?

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:06.960
BECAUSE, FOR EXAMPLE,
BETWEEN 1997 AND 2000

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.500
THE UNITED STATES
EXPORTED MILLIONS

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.900
OF KILOS OF
PESTICIDAL PRODUCTS,

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:17.600
MOST OF WHICH WERE
BANNED IN AMERICA.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.900
WHERE DID THOSE 30
MILLION KILOS END UP?

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:27.400
IN PLACES LIKE SOUTH
AMERICA, AFRICA AND ASIA.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.360
IN THE YEAR 2000 THE
MINISTRY OF HEALTH OF

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.860
BRAZIL ESTIMATED THAT
THE COUNTRY HAD RECORDED

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.630
300,000 ANNUAL CASES
OF INTOXICATION

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:40.700
AND 5,000 DEATHS CAUSED
BY BANNED PESTICIDES.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.630
ACCORDING TO AN INDONESIAN
STUDY, 21% OF THE

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.800
FUMIGATION OPERATIONS
CARRIED OUT IN THAT

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.360
VAST ISLAND NATION HAD
CAUSED CASES OF NERVE,

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.260
LUNG OR INTESTINAL
PROBLEMS.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.800
A UNITED NATIONS SURVEY
POINTED OUT THAT NO LESS

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.400
THAN 88% OF ALL CAMBODIAN
FARMERS USING PESTICIDES

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.300
SHOW SYMPTOMS OF
INTOXICATION.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.660
IN AFRICA, WOMEN AND
CHILDREN PRODUCE 80% OF

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.630
THE FOOD SUPPLY AND THUS
ARE EXPOSED TO PESTICIDES

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.330
ON AN INCREASING SCALE.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.560
IT HAS BEEN NOTED THAT
THERE ARE SOME 120,000 TONS

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:40.200
OF OBSOLETE PESTICIDES
STORED ON THAT CONTINENT.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.700
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THESE
THE LAW ITSELF OFTEN ACTS

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.000
AS AN ACCOMPLICE TO
POLLUTING COMPANIES.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.060
VULNERABLE COMMUNITY
GROUPS AREN'T CAPABLE OF

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.030
TAKING EFFECTIVE
PROTECTIVE MEASURES

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:04.400
OR OF OBTAINING
PROPER LEGAL SUPPORT.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.830
IN THE RARE CASES IN WHICH
THREATENED COMMUNITIES

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:09.360
HAVE MANAGED TO PRESS
CHARGES, COMPANIES HAVE

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.100
BEEN ABLE TO DELAY THE
LEGAL PROCESS INDEFINITELY

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.060
BY SEEKING PROTECTION
UNDER OBSCURE LAWS OR

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:20.430
SIMPLY BY BRIBING JUDGES
AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.300
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
HAS DEMANDED THAT CERTAIN

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.830
POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS
CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES BE

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:52.060
CLASSIFIED AS "OF COMMUNAL
CONCERN" BUT NOT BANNED.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.660
THE COMMISSION MERELY
AIMS TO ASK EXPORTERS TO

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.560
EXERCISE PROPER CONTROL
OVER THEIR USE WITHOUT

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:02.300
SPECIFYING WHAT "PROPER
CONTROL" MIGHT MEAN.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.600
WE STILL CAN'T PREDICT
WHEN AN EARTHQUAKE

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.900
WILL OCCUR OR
PREVENT THE FORMATION

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.860
OF A DEVASTATING
HURRICANE.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.430
OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT
GREAT FLOODS HAVE

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:30.660
CERTAINLY EXISTED SINCE
THE DAWN OF TIME

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.660
AND THAT THERE EXIST
TALES FROM ANCIENT

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.730
AFRICAN BARDS
EVOKING THE DEATHS OF

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.860
THOUSANDS OF ANCIENT
PEOPLE IN DROUGHTS

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.200
PROVOKED BY THE
FURY OF THE GODS.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.060
SURELY NATURE HAS ALWAYS
MARKED ITS TERRITORY,

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:47.460
HAS ALWAYS STIRRED UNEASILY,
ALWAYS FLOODED CROPS

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:52.660
AND PROVOKED DISASTERS,
MIGRATIONS AND STARVATION.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.100
HOWEVER, RECENT STUDIES AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.560
CAROLINA SUGGEST VERY
STRONGLY THAT OVER THE

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.260
LAST 40 YEARS BOTH THE
FREQUENCY AND MAGNITUDE OF

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.400
NATURAL DISASTERS HAVE
INCREASED PROGRESSIVELY.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.430
FLOODS AND
EARTHQUAKES ARE NOW

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:48.230
NINE TIMES
MORE FREQUENT,

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.330
THEIR CONSEQUENCES
NINE TIMES WORSE.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.400
IN SPITE OF THE
TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.830
OUR CIVILIZATION HAS
EXPERIENCED OVER THE

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.060
SECOND HALF OF THE 20TH
CENTURY, WE HAVEN'T REALLY

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.830
BEEN ABLE TO ADAPT MUCH OF
IT TO PREVENTING RISKS.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.530
ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES WHERE

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.230
90% OF SUCH DISASTERS
HAVE OCCURRED,

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:13.230
AND 99% OF
THEIR CASUALTIES.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.730
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF
VICTIMS IS ESTIMATED TO BE

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:19.330
SOME 25 TIMES LARGER
THAN IN PAST CENTURIES.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.660
IF WE COMPARE OLD
CHRONICLES WITH MODERN

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.360
RECORDS WE CAN CLEARLY SEE
THAT THE REGULARITY AND

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.060
INTENSITY OF SOME OF
THESE NATURAL DISASTERS

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.700
HAVE INCREASED
OVER PAST DECADES.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.700
FLOODS CAUSED BY
DEFORESTATION;

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.300
HURRICANE DAMAGE
GETTING WORSE AND WORSE;

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.600
TIDAL WAVES CAUSING MORE
HAVOC THAN EVER BECAUSE OF

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.230
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF
MANGROVE SWAMPS AND REEFS;

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:43.260
AND FAMINE
DUE TO DROUGHT.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.460
THESE ARE ALL DIRECTLY
RELATED TO THE CONSTANT

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.560
DETERIORATION OF
THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.560
IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT
THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.700
PEOPLE AFFECTED ARE,
AS WE HAVE SEEN,

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.100
RESIDENTS OF
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.400
IN THE 90'S, MORE THAN
TWO BILLION INHABITANTS

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.100
OF THE THIRD WORLD
HAD BEEN AFFECTED

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:03.060
BY NATURAL DISASTERS.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.160
MANGROVE SWAMPS ARE
TROPICAL FORESTS

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.760
LYING ALONG COASTAL AREAS
NEAR ESTUARIES AND REEFS

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.630
THAT FORM A
RICH ECOSYSTEM

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.230
ABOUNDING WITH A GREAT
DIVERSITY OF SPECIES.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.430
THEY'RE VERY FRAGILE,
HOWEVER, AND PLAY A

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.600
CRUCIAL ROLE IN
PROTECTING LAND FALL

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.160
FROM THE EROSIVE
POWER AND FLOODING

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.130
INFLICTED BY HURRICANES
AND TIDAL WAVES.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.130
IN THE LAST DECADES
THE PREDATORY ACTION

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.700
OF MANKIND HAS CAUSED
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.360
50% OF THESE
SHORELINE FORESTS.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:49.000
SOUTHEAST ASIA IS
A CLEAR EXAMPLE.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.800
FOR SOME TWO DECADES NOW
THE BREEDING OF SHRIMP

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.730
AND FISH FARMS HAS
INCREASED ASTRONOMICALLY.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.730
IN ORDER TO INSTALL THE
VAST SYSTEMS OF POOLS

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.200
THAT SHRIMP NEED TO
BREED IT'S NECESSARY TO

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.830
CUT DOWN
THE MANGROVES.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.100
SHRIMP BREEDING WAS
TRADITIONALLY DONE BY

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.760
LOCAL COMMUNITIES ON A SMALL
SUBSISTENCE TYPE SCALE,

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.860
USUALLY IN RICE FIELDS
AND ALONG THE COAST

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.000
OF COUNTRIES SUCH
AS INDIA, THAILAND,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.400
VIETNAM OR INDONESIA.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.000
BUT NOW THAT HAS BEEN
REPLACED BY INDUSTRIAL

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.630
FISH FARMS, WHICH BESIDES
DESTROYING THE NATURAL

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.760
PROTECTIVE VEGETATION
ALONG THE COASTS,

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.060
EMPLOY PRODUCTION SYSTEMS
THAT ARE INCOMPATIBLE

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.230
WITH THE LARGER
ENVIRONMENT AT RISK.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.700
DURING THE ASIAN
PACIFIC TSUNAMI IN 2004

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.860
THE MOST AFFECTED
COMMUNITIES WERE THOSE

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.030
THAT HAD DESTROYED THEIR
NATURAL COASTAL BARRIERS

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:49.900
BY ADHERING TO SUCH
DEVELOPMENT FRENZY.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.600
THE MEKONG RIVER DELTA
IS THE MOST DENSELY

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.500
POPULATED CORNER
OF THE WORLD.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.960
THIS LABYRINTH OF
CANALS AND RICE FIELDS

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.530
HAS ALWAYS
SUFFERED FLOODING.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:04.830
THE WATERS RISE AND FALL TO
THE RHYTHM OF THE MONSOONS.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.200
PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS
KNOWN HOW TO

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.900
ADAPT TO THIS
ANNUAL PHENOMENON.

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:19.060
MOST OF THE INHABITANTS
LIVE ON RICE CROPS

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.660
SO IF THE MONSOONS DON'T
COME OR COME TOO LATE

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.330
OR WITHOUT NORMAL INTENSITY
AS IS THE CASE LATELY,

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.460
THE CONSEQUENCES
CAN BE FATAL.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.200
IN THE HIGH AND LOW
STRETCHES OF THE RIVER,

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.560
FORESTS HAVE BEEN
OBLITERATED.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.430
THESE FORESTS ONCE
STOPPED FLOODS.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.260
NOW MUD AVALANCHES
DEVASTATE FIELDS

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:16.600
AND HERDS AND CROPS
ALONG WITH THEM.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.530
IN SEPTEMBER 2000, HEAVY
RAINFALL CAUSED FLOODS

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.030
LIKE NEVER BEFORE
THROUGHOUT THE MEKONG AREA

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.630
AND AFFLUENT RIVERS.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.460
THE WATERS FLOODED PARTS
OF NORTHERN THAILAND,

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.230
LAOS, CAMBODIA
AND VIETNAM.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:34.860
HALF A MILLION PEOPLE HAD
TO ABANDON THEIR HOMES.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.530
ANOTHER PROBLEM IN
THE MEKONG DELTA

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.530
IS THE DAMS UPSTREAM.

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.930
THE DROP IN FLOW HAS
CAUSED SEA WATER TO

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:52.830
ENTER THE DELTA AND
REACH THE RICE FIELDS.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.160
BUT APART FROM THE
CONSEQUENCES AND EFFECTS

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.430
THAT CLIMATE CHANGE
HAS HAD UPON THE RAINY

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.630
SEASONS, IT HAS BEEN THE
INDISCRIMINATE FELLING

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.100
OF TREES THAT HAS BEEN THE
MOST DEVASTATING FACTOR

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.900
WITH RESPECT TO
LIFE AND DEATH

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.200
FOR THE INHABITANTS
OF THE MEKONG DELTA.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.460
YET THIS IS HARDLY AN
EXCEPTION; RATHER,

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.430
IT'S THE NORM THAT
HAS REPEATED ITSELF

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.860
ALONG ALL THE GREAT
WATERWAYS ON THE PLANET.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.230
AS RECENTLY AS THE
MID 20TH CENTURY

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:32.060
THE AMAZON BASIN WAS
AS LARGE AS AUSTRALIA.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.260
OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS,
HOWEVER, ONE MILLION

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.960
SQUARE KILOMETERS OF
FOREST LAND HAVE BEEN LOST

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.760
- ABOUT A FIFTH OF ITS
TOTAL SURFACE AREA.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.430
IN THE DRY SEASON AN
AVERAGE OF ABOUT 8,000

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.760
FIRES ARE SET FOR THE
PURPOSE OF CLEARING LAND

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.060
FOR RAISING CATTLE AND
CROPS BELONGING TO LARGE

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.260
LAND HOLDERS WHO WILL
EXPORT THEIR PRODUCTS

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:09.160
TO EUROPE, JAPAN AND
THE UNITED STATES.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.030
LOCAL RESIDENTS ARE
FORCED OFF THESE LANDS

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.600
OR EXPLOITED ON THE
MASSIVE ESTATES.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.560
AT BEST, THEY RECEIVE
MERE CRUMBS OF THE

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.730
TREMENDOUS PROFITS
THAT THE ANNIHILATION

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:24.000
OF THE AMAZONIAN
RAIN FOREST BRINGS.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.400
THIS DESTRUCTIVE FRENZY
HASN'T PAUSED FOR A SECOND

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.700
EVER SINCE 1970.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.100
UP UNTIL THEN IN ALL
RECORDED HISTORY

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.600
THE AMAZON HAD SUFFERED
ONLY ABOUT A 1% LOSS

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.560
OF ITS ORIGINAL SIZE.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.460
BY 1978, HOWEVER,
ALMOST 4% OF THE TOTAL

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.700
SURFACE AREA OF THE
FOREST HAD BEEN DESTROYED.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.460
AND THEN THE PROCESS
WENT INTO OVERDRIVE,

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.400
FOR JUST 10 YEARS
LATER OVER 400,000

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.800
SQUARE KILOMETERS HAD
BEEN SLASHED AND BURNED.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.200
BY THE YEAR 2000, 15%
OF THE AMAZONIAN FOREST

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.560
HAD DISAPPEARED.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.560
MOST OF THAT LAND
IS NOW DEDICATED TO

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.100
INDUSTRIAL SIZED FARMS
GROWING SOYBEANS.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.730
BEGINNING IN THE YEAR
1900, ONE NATIVE TRIBE

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:18.030
HAD DISAPPEARED EACH
YEAR IN BRAZIL.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.000
THEIR ENCOUNTER WITH
THE OUTER WORLD HAS

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.800
BROUGHT THEM IMPORTED
DISEASES, ALCOHOLISM, AND,

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.530
MOST DEVASTATINGLY, THE
LOSS OF LAND AND IDENTITY.

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.260
AND SO WHEN THE FOREST
DISAPPEARS, SO DO ITS

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.700
INHABITANTS, THE ORIGINAL
GENUINE RESIDENTS

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.700
OF THESE BEAUTIFUL YET
UNFORGIVING SPACES.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:37.560
A DRAMATIC STORY INDEED IS
THAT OF THE KIOWA INDIANS.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.500
SINCE 1987, 200 OF THEM
HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.900
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T ENDURE
THE LOSS OF THEIR LAND.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.130
AND IT'S NOT AN
ISOLATED CASE.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.260
A LARGE SHARE OF BRAZILIAN
MAHOGANY COMES FROM

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.700
THE ILLEGAL FELLING OF
TREES ON NATIVE LANDS.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.930
WITH THE MASS INVASION
OF PROSPECTORS,

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:55.460
20% OF THE 10,000
YANOMAMI INDIANS DIED,

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:58.060
MAINLY DUE
TO MALARIA.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.900
AT THE WORST STAGE OF THE
INVASION, THERE WERE NO

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:04.630
CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE
OF TWO IN THE VILLAGES.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.100
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS
LAWLESS EXPLOITATION OF

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.000
THE RAIN FOREST ARE VERY
SERIOUS AND NOT ONLY FOR

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.630
BRAZIL OR EVEN FOR THE
REST OF THE COUNTRIES

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:47.430
IN THE AMAZONIAN BASIN, BUT
FOR THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.230
ILLEGAL LOGGING AND THE
BURNING OF TROPICAL

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:07.460
FORESTS CAUSE 35% OF THE
CARBON MONOXIDE RELEASED

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.830
TO RETURN TO
THE ATMOSPHERE.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.860
THIS IS ONE OF THE
CENTRAL CAUSES OF THE

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.900
DETERIORATION OF
THE OZONE LAYER

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:19.460
AND THE PLANET'S
CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:31.300
MOREOVER, FORESTS ARE
IMPORTANT WATER REGULATORS.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.330
THE STRUCTURES OF
TREE ROOTS ACT AS

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.660
NATURAL SPONGES,
ABSORBING WATER

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:39.660
AND LIBERATING
IT SLOWLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:42.830
THIS WAY THEY REGULATE
RIVERS, REPLACE

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:47.830
UNDERGROUND WATER, HELP
REDUCE SOIL EROSION,

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:49.930
AND FREE HUMIDITY
AS IT IS NEEDED

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:53.130
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:55.760
IF THE FORESTS ARE CUT
DOWN, SEDIMENTATION

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.600
OBSTRUCTS WATERWAYS,
FLOODS BECOME INEVITABLY

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:03.100
MORE FREQUENT, UNDERGROUND
WATER RESERVES DISAPPEAR

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:07.360
AND OUR WEATHER CHANGES.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.300
THE EXCESSIVE EXTRACTION
AND REROUTING OF WATER

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.330
HAS ALSO AFFECTED
INHABITANTS

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.560
OF AREAS AROUND
THE NILE RIVER.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.630
THEY HAVE SEEN HOW THE
FLUCTUATIONS OF THE RIVER

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:32.760
NO LONGER MEET THEIR
IRRIGATIONAL NEEDS

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.760
AND MANY HAVE HAD
TO EMIGRATE

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.460
TO BIG CITIES
SUCH AS CAIRO.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:48.730
OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES,
THOUSANDS OF AFRICANS

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.830
FROM ALL OVER THE
CONTINENT HAVE ABANDONED

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.060
RURAL AREAS AND SETTLED
IN CITIES THAT WERE

00:31:53.060 --> 00:32:00.060
UNPREPARED FOR THAT
KIND OF EXODUS.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:04.500
NATURALLY, VULNERABILITY
INCREASES WITH POVERTY.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.000
IN THE ABSENCE OF RULES
THAT COULD ORGANIZE THE

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
LAND AND OVERCOME THE LACK
OF CERTAIN RESOURCES,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.600
PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES
OBLIGED TO LIVE IN AREAS

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.260
AT THEIR OWN RISK.

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.930
THEY SETTLE PLAINS AND
FLATLANDS NEAR ESTUARIES

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:21.730
THAT ARE SURE TO BE
FLOODED OR PERILOUSLY

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:25.930
PRECARIOUS AREAS PRONE TO
MUDSLIDES OR ROCKSLIDES.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.500
ACCORDING TO THE UNITED
NATIONS, AT THE BEGINNING

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.660
OF THE 21ST CENTURY, 250
MILLION PEOPLE WERE LIVING

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.230
IN UNDEVELOPED COUNTRIES
WHERE THEY WERE EXPOSED TO

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:42.700
FLOODING, DROUGHTS,
EARTHQUAKES OR HURRICANES

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.900
AND AS A CONSEQUENCE
THEY WOULD BE FORCED TO

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.000
CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY
OF ABANDONING THEIR

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
TRADITIONAL TOWNSHIPS
AND MOVING TO OTHER

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.960
VULNERABLE AREAS USUALLY
CHARACTERIZED BY

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.100
GENERALLY LAWLESS
CONDITIONS.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.500
THIS NUMBER HAD INCREASED
FROM 1990 ACTUALLY.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:03.400
BACK THEN IT
WAS ONLY 53,000.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.130
IT HAD DOUBLED BY 2003.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:09.130
AND THEN IN 2004
WHEN A TSUNAMI HIT,

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:12.960
SOME 200,000
PEOPLE DIED.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.860
TURNING THE EARTH INTO
A DUMP HAS A PRICE.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:34.030
THE CONSEQUENCES ARE
SERIOUS AND MANY.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:36.230
ONE OF THEM IS
ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE -

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:38.960
THE EXTINCTION OF ANIMAL
AND PLANT SPECIES.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.660
A WORLD HERITAGE WHOSE
PRESERVATION IS NOT MERELY

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.960
THE WHIM OF SOME
ECOLOGIST OR NATURALIST

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.760
BUT A FIRST CLASS
ECONOMIC NECESSITY.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.360
90% OF THE SPECIES IN
DANGER OF EXTINCTION

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.630
LIVE IN THIRD
WORLD COUNTRIES.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.100
THEIR UNWITTING ROLE OF
PARTICIPATING IN THE

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.760
GLOBAL DUMP IS ENDANGERING
DIVERSITY, THE FUTURE OF

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.330
SCIENTIFIC ADVANCEMENT,
AND THE DAILY ECONOMY

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:03.760
OF THOUSANDS OF
LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:27.260
MANAUS IS KNOWN AS THE
GREAT CITY OF THE AMAZON.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.960
IT THRIVED ON THE NEEDS
OF THE RUBBER INDUSTRY

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.500
THROUGHOUT THE 20TH
CENTURY AND IS NOW HOME

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.860
TO OVER ONE MILLION
INHABITANTS.

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.600
ITS DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN
SO QUICK AND UNREGULATED,

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.230
AROUND 90% OF ALL
ITS ANIMAL SPECIES

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:46.360
HAVE DISAPPEARED.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.060
FISHING, ONCE PLENTIFUL,
IS NOW SCARCE.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.560
ITS MAIN ACTIVITY IS
BRINGING RESOURCES

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.000
IN FROM THE FOREST.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.730
EACH YEAR 200,000
TONS OF FISH

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:06.700
COME OUT OF THE
AMAZONIAN BASIN.

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:10.030
AT THE MARKET IN MANAUS
MORE THAN 40 VARIETIES

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:13.330
OF AMAZONIAN
FISH ARE SOLD.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:17.600
THE MOST VALUED IS
PERHAPS THE PIRARUCU.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.600
AS LARGE AS A SHARK,

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.330
THIS FISH CAN WEIGH
UP TO 200 KILOS.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:26.730
IT'S A TRUE GIANT THAT
IS EVER MORE THREATENED

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:33.760
BY INDUSTRIAL
STYLE FISHING.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.060
NOT LONG AGO THERE
WERE 15 TIMES MORE

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.130
FRESH WATER SPECIES
IN THE AMAZON

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.830
THAN THOSE IN ALL THE
EUROPEAN WATERS COMBINED.

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:44.830
RECENT STUDIES SHOW THAT
AREAS THAT ONCE SUPPORTED

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:47.160
BETWEEN 1,200
AND 1,500 SPECIES

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:52.800
NOW ARE HOME
TO ABOUT 400.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:36:00.730
THIS SERIOUSLY AFFECTS
NATIVE POPULATIONS.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:04.100
OF THE 140 MILLION
INHABITANTS IN BRAZIL,

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.800
20 MILLION LIVE IN THE
AMAZONIAN BASIN AND ARE

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.330
THREATENED BY THE DAMAGE
TO THE RAIN FOREST.

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:13.260
SOME LIVE IN BIG CITIES
LIKE MANAUS WHILE OTHERS

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.530
LIVE IN ISOLATION IN
NATIVE COMMUNITIES.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:19.930
THERE ARE 200,000
AMAZONIAN NATIVES

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.230
THAT HAVE SEEN AND STILL
SEE THEIR FUTURE IN

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.630
GRAVE DANGER BECAUSE OF
THE SEEMINGLY UNSTOPPABLE

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:27.200
ADVANCE OF MODERN
DEVELOPMENT - FROM WHICH

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:33.000
THEY RECEIVE ONLY MIRRORS
AND COLORED BEADS.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.660
ALONG THE WEST COAST OF
AFRICA, AT ROUGHLY THE

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.600
SAME LONGITUDE AS THE
AFRICAN SAHEL, WE FIND

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.830
ONE OF THE RICHEST PLACES
IN THE WORLD FOR FISHING.

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:07.530
HOWEVER, OVER THE PAST
THREE DECADES ENORMOUS

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:09.760
FISH FARM BOATS WITH
JAPANESE, RUSSIAN OR

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.030
SPANISH FLAGS HAVE
EXHAUSTED THESE WATERS

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:20.960
WITH THE LOCAL
GOVERNMENT'S COMPLICITY.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.100
AT THE SAME TIME, ALL
DOWN THIS COASTLINE

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.600
THOUSANDS OF MEN
MAKE A LIVING OUT OF

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.160
TRADITIONAL FISHING IN
DIRECT COMPETITION WITH

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.830
THE ENORMOUS
INTERNATIONAL VESSELS.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:41.900
THE LOCAL FISHERMEN LOOK
FOR SARDINES AND MULLETS.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.160
GROUPERS, GILTHEAD
BREAMS, OR SQUIDS

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.200
ARE FOR THE
FISH FARM VESSELS.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.530
BUT IN THE QUEST
FOR THESE PRODUCTS,

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:55.030
THE LATTER DEVASTATE
EVERYTHING THEY COME ACROSS.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.360
SPECIES THAT ONCE THRIVED
ON THE MAURITANIAN BANK,

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.330
JUST LIKE IN MANY OTHERS,
ARE SEVERELY DEPLETED.

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:08.800
WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE BIG
INTERNATIONALS GO LOOK FOR

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.300
OTHER FISHING GROUNDS TO
DEPLETE WHILE TRADITIONAL

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:17.960
FISHERMEN END UP HAVING
TO MIGRATE TO EUROPE.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:27.960
♪

00:38:27.960 --> 00:39:42.530
♪

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.460
NOT ONLY
ON FIRM GROUND

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.660
THE RUBBISH AND
DAMAGE ACCUMULATES;

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.500
THE SEA ALSO HAS
HAD HER SHARE.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.160
THE SEA BED WAS ALWAYS
GENEROUS TO MANKIND,

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.360
WHO IN TURN GENERALLY
RESPONDED WITH SINCERE

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.160
GRATITUDE - UNTIL
THE 20TH CENTURY,

00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.200
THAT IS, WHEN
INDUSTRIAL FISHING

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.530
MADE ITS APPEARANCE
ON THE GLOBAL SCENE.

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.660
FROM THAT MOMENT ON,
OVER EXPLOITATION

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.260
HAS BEEN THE NORM.

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.530
AND NOW OVER HALF OF ALL
COMMERCIAL FISH SPECIES

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.160
ARE IN DANGER
OF EXTINCTION.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.100
JUST A QUARTER OF ALL
THE SEA'S RESOURCES

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.000
ARE SAFE FROM THIS
TYPE OF DEVASTATION.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.900
NATURAL DISASTERS CAUSED
BY CHEMICAL PRODUCTS

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:20.460
HAVE INCREASED
SINCE 1960.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:26.300
ONE OF THE GREATEST
SOURCES IS DUMPING.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:30.360
BETWEEN ONE ONE-THOUSANDTH
AND TWO THOUSANDTHS OF THE

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.560
WORLD'S OIL PRODUCTION
ENDS UP IN THE SEA.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.930
SHIPPING ACCIDENTS,
PETROL STATIONS,

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:37.830
AND REFINERIES DUMP
ALMOST THREE MILLION

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:40.100
TONS OF OIL INTO
THE WATER EACH YEAR

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:49.800
CAUSING IRREVERSIBLE
DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:53.460
THE TRANSFORMATION OF
TROPICAL RAIN FORESTS

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:56.060
INTO CULTIVATED FIELDS,

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.130
OF RIVER BANKS
INTO CAR PARKS,

00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.830
OR SEA BEDS
INTO DESERTS,

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:02.560
OBVIOUSLY HAVE SERIOUS
CONSEQUENCES FOR ALL OF US

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.230
- NOT ONLY FOR
THOSE COMMUNITIES

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:10.000
THAT SUFFER
MOST DIRECTLY.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.930
IT IS CALCULATED THAT
HUMAN BEINGS HAVE

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:16.030
INCREASED THE RATE OF
ANIMAL SPECIES EXTINCTION

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:20.560
BY UP TO 100,000%
OF ITS NATURAL PACE.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.500
WE HAVE DESTROYED, OR
ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:46.960
DESTROYING, 12% OF ALL
BIRDS, 25% OF MAMMALS,

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:50.300
AND 32% OF
ALL AMPHIBIANS.

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.000
IF WE DON'T
STOP THIS PROCESS

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.530
AND ACHIEVE
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

00:41:55.530 --> 00:42:00.830
WE WILL SOON LOSE CONTROL
OVER OUR OWN SURVIVAL.

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.030
THERE'S NO CONSENSUS
ON THE CAUSES OF

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:19.860
THE EARTH'S RECENT
CLIMATIC CHANGES.

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:21.800
IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE THAT
THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.860
ISN'T THE RESULT
EXCLUSIVELY

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.630
OF HUMAN ACTIVITY.

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:28.730
IN FACT, WITHOUT IT THE
AVERAGE TEMPERATURE

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:34.030
OF THE EARTH WOULD BE
18 DEGREES BELOW ZERO.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:37.560
OUR ATMOSPHERE NEEDS
CARBON DIOXIDE, CO2,

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.230
TO REGULATE GLOBAL
TEMPERATURE.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:42.460
HOWEVER, THERE<i> IS</i>
SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:44.530
REGARDING THE ARTIFICIAL
INCREASES IN CERTAIN

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:47.000
FACTORS THAT CAUSE
TEMPERATURE INCREASES

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.400
AND DISORDERS IN
NATURAL WEATHER CYCLES.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:06.830
AND THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT IS HAPPENING.

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:09.300
GLOBAL CLIMATE IS BEING
ALTERED AS A CONSEQUENCE

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.400
OF THE INCREASED
CONCENTRATION

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:12.800
OF GREENHOUSE GASES.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.130
THESE GASES WILL INCREASE
THE PLANET'S TEMPERATURE

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:19.330
BETWEEN 1.5 AND 4.5
DEGREES CELSIUS.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:22.000
THE CONSEQUENCES
CAN ALREADY BE SEEN:

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.530
FLOODING OF COASTAL AREAS
AND CITIES, FIERCER STORMS,

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:28.960
THE EXTINCTION OF
COUNTLESS ANIMAL

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.430
AND PLANT SPECIES,
MORE DROUGHTS.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:11.330
MANKIND'S ENERGY USE HAS
BEEN 16 TIMES GREATER

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:14.930
IN THE 20TH CENTURY THAN
BEFORE, AND 80% OF THIS

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:18.230
ENERGY HAS BEEN OBTAINED
FROM FOSSIL FUEL, COAL AND

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:20.900
PETROLEUM PRODUCTS WHICH
HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.900
A 25% INCREASE OF CO2
IN THE ATMOSPHERE

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.330
OVER THE LAST CENTURY.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
WE ARE CREATING A WORLD
THAT IS BASED ON

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.500
BIG CITIES, A WORLD OF
CONCRETE AND CEMENT.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.900
CITIES CONTAMINATED BY
SMOKE, DESIGNED FOR HUSTLE

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:49.900
AND BUSTLE, FOR THE WASTE
OF RESOURCES AND ENERGY.

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:51.800
WE HAVE CREATED
AN URBAN WORLD

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.030
WITH AN UNSUSTAINABLE
PRODUCTION SYSTEM

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:57.330
AND LEVELS OF CONSUMPTION,
AND IT IS UNSUSTAINABLE

00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:59.630
BECAUSE OF TWO
BASIC PRINCIPLES.

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.730
IT'S BASED ON THE
INDISCRIMINATE USE OF

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:03.960
SOURCE MATERIALS AND
IS CONCEIVED IN A WAY

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.700
THAT TWO-THIRDS OF
THE HUMAN RACE

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:10.130
CAN NEVER ACCESS
THE PROFITS.

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.430
IF WE CONSIDER THE FACT
THAT FIRST WORLD COUNTRIES

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:00.200
CONSUME 90% OF THE
DIRTY ENERGY PRODUCED

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.260
AND THAT THIRD
WORLD COUNTRIES

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:04.260
SUFFER THE WORST
CONSEQUENCES OF THE

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.900
NATURAL DISASTERS
CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE,

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.260
WE FIND OURSELVES
BACK AT SQUARE ONE.

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.330
IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL
DAMAGE SUFFERED

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:15.130
THE SAME WAY IN MALI
AS IN CHICAGO?

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:19.960
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S NOT.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.530
ONE OF THE TANGIBLE
CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:44.330
CHANGE IS THE DIZZYING
ADVANCE OF THE DESERT.

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:47.300
THIS OASIS ONCE STRETCHED
OVER TWICE THE AREA

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:49.830
IT DOES NOW AND THAT WAS
JUST A FEW YEARS AGO.

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:54.560
NOT LONG FROM NOW IT
PROBABLY WON'T EVEN EXIST.

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.900
IN THE DESERT AND
SURROUNDING AREAS

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.760
THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
DROUGHTS AND FAMINE

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:07.060
BUT THEY WERE OCCASIONAL
AND PREDICTABLE.

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:11.960
OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS THE
SLOW BUT UNSTOPPABLE RISE

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.730
IN GLOBAL TEMPERATURES
HAS DRIED UP WELLS

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:17.130
AND DEVASTATED
GRAZING AREAS

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:20.800
ON THE FRINGES
OF OUR DESERTS.

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.930
NOMADIC PEOPLES HAVE
HAD TO ABANDON THEIR

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:35.860
TRADITIONAL WAYS OF LIFE
AND MOVE TO CITIES LIKE

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:42.860
BAMAKO OR NIENA.

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.300
THERE MIGHT BE OTHER
CAUSES TO TAKE INTO

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.960
ACCOUNT BUT HARDLY ANYONE
NOW DOUBTS THAT OUR MODEL

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:50.230
OF DEVELOPMENT HAS AIDED
IN THE INCREASED RATE OF

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:53.760
FLOODS AND DROUGHTS OVER
THE LAST FEW DECADES.

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:12.830
IN INDONESIA, TREMENDOUS
SPATES OF RAINFALL

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:15.100
HAVE ADDED TO
DEFORESTATION AND

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:18.100
CAUSED SIGNIFICANT
LOSS OF LAND.

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.400
MANY INHABITANTS
OF BORNEO AND SUMATRA

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.800
HAVE LEFT THE JUNGLE TO
CROWD TOGETHER IN CITIES

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.100
SUCH AS JOYAKARTA WHERE
THEY FESTER WITHOUT

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:29.100
HARDLY EVEN THE MOST
BASIC OF SERVICES.

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.130
IT'S A REALITY WE CANNOT
JUST CLOSE OUR EYES TO,

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:47.760
FROM WHICH WE CAN
SIMPLY WALK AWAY.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:50.230
THE POOR SUFFER THE
CONSEQUENCES MANIFEST

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:52.800
IN A NATURAL SYSTEM
SO PROFITS MAY BE

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:56.630
ACCUMULATED IN FIRST
WORLD COUNTRIES.

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:58.760
THE LARGE SCALE
DEFORESTATION PROJECTS

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.330
OCCURRING IN PLACES SUCH
AS THE AMAZON OR INDONESIA

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:03.760
START IN SOME SENSES
WITH THE DEMAND FOR

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.360
MEAT OR PAPER
IN OTHER PLACES

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.060
FAR REMOVED FROM
THOSE FORESTS.

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:10.200
THE NEGATIVE IMPACT
OF CLIMATE CHANGE

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.400
IS DISPROPORTIONATELY
AFFECTING THE RICH

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:18.230
AND THE POOR,
BUT NOT ALIKE.

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:21.400
AND WE'D BE DECEIVING
OURSELVES IF WE THOUGHT

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:24.130
THAT BY SIMPLY MOVING
THE RISKS OUT OF OUR OWN

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:26.260
BACK YARDS AND
INTO SOMEBODY ELSE'S

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:28.500
WE COULD BE FREE
OF THE CONSEQUENCES.

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.160
IN A GLOBALIZED WORLD,
DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.660
IS ALSO GLOBAL.

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:34.660
THE CURRENT PRODUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.760
IS SIMPLY UNVIABLE OVER
THE MIDDLE AND LONG TERM.

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:40.560
CURRENT TECHNOLOGY COULD
ALLOW US TO PRODUCE AND

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:43.600
CONSUME IN A SUSTAINABLE
WAY BY CALCULATING RISKS

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.830
AND AVOIDING TURNING 80%
OF MANKIND'S PRODUCTION

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:51.130
INTO A WASTE DUMP FOR
THE REST OF THE WORLD.

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:06.660
APPLYING THE MODEL,
HOWEVER, CHANGING PEOPLES'

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:09.900
HABITS ISN'T SIMPLY AN
OPTION, IT'S A NECESSITY.

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.130

RESPONSIBILITY.
