00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:19.970


2
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.130
Open your ears,

3
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.470
for which of you will stop thevent of hearing

4
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.400
when loud rumor speaks?

5
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.800
I, from the orient to thedrooping west,

6
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.770
making the wind my post-horse,

7
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.400
still unfold the acts commencedon this ball of earth.

8
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.530
I run before King Harry'svictory,

9
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.870
who, in a bloody field byShrewsbury,

10
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.500
hath beaten down young Hotspurand his troops,

11
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.100
quenching the flame of boldrebellion

12
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.370
even with the rebel's blood.

13
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.430
But what mean I to speak so trueat first?

14
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.170
My office is to noise abroadthat Harry Monmouth fell

15
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.830
under the wrath of nobleHotspur's sword,

16
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.170
and that the king, before theDouglas' rage,

17
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.370
stooped his anointed head as lowas death.

18
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.530
This have I rumored through thepeasant towns

19
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.570
between that royal field ofShrewsbury

20
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.170
and this worm-eaten hold ofragged stone,

21
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.400
where Hotspur's father, oldNorthumberland,

22
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.800
lies crafty-sick.

23
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.530
The posts come tiring on...

24
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.230
and not a man of them bringsother news

25
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.630
than they have learnt of me.

26
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.930
From rumor's tongues,

27
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.030
they bring smooth comfortsfalse,

28
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.730
worse than true wrongs.

29
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.300
What news, Lord Bardolph?

30
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.670
Every minute now should be thefather of some stratagem.

31
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.330
The times are wild.

32
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.630
Contention, like a horse full ofhigh feeding,

33
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.070
madly hath broke loose and bearsdown all before him.

34
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.970
Noble earl, I bring you certainnews from Shrewsbury.

35
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.400
Good, an God will.

36
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.900
As good as heart can wish.

37
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.630
The king is almost wounded tothe death,

38
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.230
and, in the fortune of my lordyour son,

39
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.830
Prince Harry slain.

40
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.400
But how was this derived?

41
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.730
Saw you the field?

42
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.000
Came you from Shrewsbury?

43
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.070
I spake with one, my lord, thatcame from thence,

44
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.030
a gentleman well bred and ofgood name,

45
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.400
who freely rendered me thesenews for true.

46
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.870
My lord, a gentleman almostforspent with speed,

47
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.700
stopped hard by me to breathehis bloodied horse.

48
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.930
He asked the way to Chester,

49
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.030
and of him I did demand whatnews from Shrewsbury.

50
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.100
He told me that rebellion hadbad luck,

51
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.830
and that young Harry Percy'sspur was cold.

52
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.700
My lord, I'll tell you what.

53
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.730
If my young lord your son havenot the day,

54
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.000
upon mine honor,

55
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.430
for a silken point I'll give mybarony.

56
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.500
Never talk of it.

57
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.600
My Lord, I spakeó

58
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.400
Speak not of that you do notknow.

59
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.870
Yea, this man's brow, like to atitle piece,

60
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.870
foretells the nature of a tragicvolume.

61
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.970
Say, Morton, didst thou comefrom Shrewsbury?

62
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.630
I ran from Shrewsbury, my noblelord,

63
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.430
where hateful death put on hisugliest mask

64
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.330
to fright our party.

65
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.470
And how doth my son and brother?

66
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.330
Thou tremblest.

67
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.130
The whiteness in thy cheek

68
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.230
is apter than thy tongue to tellthy errand.

69
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.030
Douglas is living,

70
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.030
and your brother, yet.

71
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.800
But, for my lord your sonó

72
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.870
Why, he is dead.

73
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.570
See what a ready tonguesuspicion hath.

74
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.500
I cannot think, my lord, yourson is dead.

75
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.600
I am sorry I should force you tobelieve

76
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.300
that which I would to God I hadnot seen.

77
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.930
But these mine eyes saw him inbloody state,

78
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.530
rendering faint quittance,

79
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.970
wearied and out-breathed toHarry Monmouth,

80
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.030
whose swift wrath beat down

81
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.930
the never daunted Percy to theearth,

82
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.130
from whence with life he nevermore sprung up.

83
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.530
For this I shall have timeenough to mourn.

84
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.430
In poison there is physic.

85
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.700
and these news, having beenwell,

86
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.900
that would have made me sick,

87
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.570
being sick, have in some measuremade me well.

88
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.800
Now bind my brows with iron

89
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.530
and approach the ragged'st hourthat time and spite dare bring

90
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.000
to frown upon the enragedNorthumberland.

91
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.970
Let heaven kiss earth.

92
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.270
Let not nature's hand keep thewild flood confined.

93
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.230
Let order die.

94
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.370
And let this world no longer bea stage

95
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.000
to feed contention in alingering act.

96
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.900
But let one spirit of thefirstborn Cain

97
00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.500
reign in all bosoms,

98
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.200
that each heart, being set onbloody courses,

99
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.300
the rude scene may end,

100
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.500
and darkness be the burier ofthe dead.

101
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.970
This strained passion doth youwrong, my lord.

102
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.270
We all that are engaged to thisloss

103
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.330
knew that we ventured on suchdangerous seas

104
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.800
that if we wrought our life'twas ten to one.

105
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.200
And yet we ventured,

106
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.430
for the gain proposed choked therespect of likely peril feared.

107
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.770
And since we are o'erset,venture again.

108
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:31.930
Come.

109
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.330
We will all put forth body andgoods.

110
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.470
'Tis more than time.

111
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.330
And, my most noble lord, I hearfor certain

112
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.000
and dare speak the truth,

113
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.100
the gentle archbishop of York isup with well-appointed powers.

114
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.000
He turns insurrection toreligion.

115
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.600
Supposed sincere and holy in histhoughts,

116
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.670
he's followed both with body andwith mind

117
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.900
and doth enlarge his rising withthe blood of fair King Richard,

118
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.030
scraped from Pomfret stones;

119
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.830
derives from heaven his quarreland his cause;

120
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.400
tells them he doth bestride ableeding land

121
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.130
gasping for life under greatBolingbroke.

122
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.700
And more and less do flock tofollow him.

123
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.070
I knew of this before, but, tospeak truth,

124
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.870
this present grief had wiped itfrom my mind.

125
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.400
Go in with me and counsel everyman

126
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:32.830
the aptest way for safety andrevenge.

127
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.200
Sirrah, you giant,

128
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.430
what says the doctor to mywater?

129
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.870
He said, sir, the water itself

130
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.830
was a good, clean, healthywater.

131
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.800
But for the party that owed it,

132
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.770
he might have more diseases thanhe knew for.

133
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.870
Men of all sorts take a pride togird at me.

134
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.100
The brain of this foolishcompounded clay, man,

135
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.130
is not able to invent anythingthat tends to laughter,

136
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.230
more than I invent or isinvented on me.

137
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.300
I'm not only witty in myself,

138
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.130
but the cause that wit is inother men.

139
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.170
I do here walk before thee likea sow

140
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:28.270
that has overwhelmed all herlitter but one.

141
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.700
If the prince put thee into myservice

142
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.570
for any other reason than to setme off,

143
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.900
why, then I have no judgment.

144
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.270
Thou whoreson mandrake.

145
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.970
Thou art fitter to be worn in mycap

146
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.100
than to wait at my heels.

147
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.630
What said Master Dombledon

148
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.100
about the satin for my shortcloak and my slops?

149
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.330
He said, sir, you should procurehim

150
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.230
better assurance than Bardolph.

151
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.170
He would not take his band noryours.

152
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.500
He liked not the security.

153
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.100
A whoreson Achitophel.

154
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.600
A rascally yea-forsooth knave

155
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.500
to bear a gentleman in hand andthen stand upon security.

156
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.370
I had as lief they'd putratsbane in my mouth

157
00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.300
as offer to stop it withsecurity.

158
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.900
Where is Bardolph?

159
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.370
He's gone into Smithfield to buyyour worship a horse.

160
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.530
I bought him in Paul's.

161
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.530
He'll buy me a horse inSmithfield.

162
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.230
An I could get me but a wife inthe stews,

163
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.800
I were manned, horsed, andwived.

164
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.570
Sir, here comes that nobleman

165
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.500
that committed the prince forstriking him about Bardolph.

166
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.670
Wait, close.

167
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:21.770
I will not see him.

168
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.470
What's he that goes there?

169
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.270
Falstaff, an't please yourlordship.

170
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.030
He that was in question for therobbery?

171
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.330
He, my lord.

172
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.900
But he hath since done goodservice at Shrewsbury,

173
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.400
and, as I hear,

174
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.970
is now going with some charge tothe Lord John of Lancaster.

175
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.000
What, to York?

176
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.300
Call him back again.

177
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.300
Sir John Falstaff.

178
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.230
Boy, tell him I'm deaf.

179
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.630
You will have to speak louder.

180
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.700
My master is deaf.

181
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.700
I'm sure he isó

182
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.070
to the hearing of anything good.

183
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.270
Go pluck him by the elbow.

184
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.300
I must speak with him.

185
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.470
Sir John.

186
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.470
What?

187
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.470
A young knave, and begging?

188
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.000
Is there not wars?

189
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.230
Is there not employment?

190
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.430
Sir, my lord would speak withyou.

191
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.670
Sir John Falstaff, a word withyou.

192
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.830
Oh, my lord.

193
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.930
God give your lordship good timeof day.

194
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.900
I am glad to see Your Lordshipabroad.

195
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.970
I heard say your lordship wassick.

196
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.400
I hope your lordship goes abroadby advice.

197
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.730
Your lordship, though not cleanpast your youth,

198
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.870
hath yet some smack of age inyou,

199
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.370
some relish of the saltness oftime,

200
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.570
and I must humbly beseech yourlordship

201
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.000
to have a reverent care of yourhealth.

202
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.330
Sir John, I sent for you

203
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.200
before your expedition toShrewsbury.

204
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.930
An't please your lordship,

205
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.100
I hear that His Majesty isreturned

206
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.100
with some discomfort from Wales.

207
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.100
I talk not of His Majesty.

208
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.830
You would not come when I sentfor you.

209
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.130
And I hear, moreover, that HisHighness is fallen

210
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.570
into this same whoresonapoplexy.

211
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:49.700
Well, God mend him.

212
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.170
I pray you, let me speak withyou.

213
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.570
This apoplexy, as I take it,

214
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.230
is a kind of lethargy, an'tplease your lordship,

215
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.230
a kind of sleeping in the blood,

216
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.300
a whoreson tingling.

217
00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.300
What tell you me of it?

218
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.400
Be it as it is.

219
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.730
It hath its original from muchgrief,

220
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.400
from study and perturbation ofthe brain.

221
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.500
I have read the cause of hiseffects in Galen.

222
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.130
It's a kind of deafness.

223
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.330
I think you are fallen into thedisease.

224
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.670
You hear not what I say to you.

225
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.430
Oh, very well, my lord; verywell.

226
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.770
Rather, an't please you, it'sthe disease of not listening,

227
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.770
the malady of not marking, thatI am troubled withal.

228
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.700
To punish you by the heels

229
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.300
would amend the attention ofyour ears.

230
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.230
And I care not if I do becomeyour physician.

231
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.470
I sent for you

232
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.470
when there were matters againstyou for your life.

233
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.500
As I was then advised by mylearned counsel,

234
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.600
I did not come.

235
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.470
Well, the truth is, Sir John,you live in great infamy.

236
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.300
He that buckles him in my beltcannot live in less.

237
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.870
Your means are very slender, andyour waste is great.

238
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.170
I would it were otherwise.

239
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.200
I would my means were greaterand my waist slenderer.

240
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.770
You have misled the youthfulprince.

241
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.700
The young prince hath misled me.

242
00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.930
I am the fellow with the greatbelly,

243
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.170
and he my dog.

244
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.230
Well, I am loath to gall a newhealed wound.

245
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.170
Your day's service at Shrewsburyhath a little gilded over

246
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.330
your night's exploit atGadshill.

247
00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.730
But since all is well, keep itso.

248
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.700
You follow the young prince upand down like his ill angel.

249
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.700
Not so, my lord.

250
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.300
You that are old consider not

251
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.870
the capacities of us that areyoung.

252
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.700
Will you set your name down inthe scroll of youth

253
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.570
that are written down old withall the characters of age?

254
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.230
Have you not a moist eye,

255
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:27.300
a dry hand,

256
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.300
a yellow cheek,

257
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.830
a white beard,

258
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.000
a decreasing leg,

259
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.600
an increasing belly?

260
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.500
Is not your voice broken,

261
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.500
your wind short,

262
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.370
your chin double,

263
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.500
your wit single,

264
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.700
and every part about you blastedwith antiquity?

265
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.630
And yet will you call yourselfyoung?

266
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.100
Fie, fie, fie, Sir John.

267
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:50.130
My lord, I was born at about3:00 in the afternoon

268
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.000
with a white head and somethingof a round belly.

269
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.330
For my voice,

270
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.430
I have lost it with halloing andsinging of anthems.

271
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:02.470
The truth is, I'm only old injudgment and understanding.

272
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.500
And he that will caper with mefor 1,000 marks,

273
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.570
would him lend me the money andhave at him.

274
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.400
For the box of the ear that theprince gave you,

275
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.230
he gave it like a rude prince,

276
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.230
and you took it like a sensiblelord.

277
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.770
I have chequed him for it, andthe young lion repents.

278
00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.670
Marry, not in ashes andsackcloth,

279
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.900
but in new silk and old sack.

280
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.900
Well, God send the prince abetter companion.

281
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.100
God send the companion a betterprince.

282
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.530
I cannot rid my hands of him.

283
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.370
Well, the king hath severed you.

284
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.800
I hear you are going with LordJohn of Lancaster

285
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.000
against the archbishop and theearl of Northumberland.

286
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.770
Yea, I thank your pretty sweetwit for it.

287
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:44.700
But look you pray, all you thatkiss my lady peace at home,

288
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.870
that our armies meet not in ahot day,

289
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.870
for, by the Lord, I take but twoshirts out with me,

290
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.900
and I mean not to sweatextraordinarily.

291
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.030
There is not a dangerous actioncan peep out his head

292
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.330
but I am thrust upon it.

293
00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.200
Well, I cannot last ever.

294
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.170
but it was alway yet the trickof our English nation,

295
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.430
if they have a good thing, tomake it too common.

296
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.770
If ye will needs say I'm an oldman,

297
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.730
you should give me rest.

298
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.100
I would to God my name were not

299
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.600
so terrible to the enemy as itis.

300
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.000
I were better to be eaten todeath with a rust

301
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.300
than to be scoured to nothingwith perpetual motion.

302
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.000
Well, be honest, be honest,

303
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.870
and God bless your expedition.

304
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.100
Will your lordship lend me£1,000 to furnish me forth?

305
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.700
Not a penny; not a penny.

306
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.830
Fare you well.

307
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.130
Commend me to my cousinWestmoreland.

308
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.930
If I do, fillip me with athree-man beetle.

309
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.230
Boy, what money's in my purse?

310
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.630
Seven groats and two pence.

311
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:52.230
I can get no remedy against thisconsumption of the purse.

312
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.270
Borrowing only lingers andlingers it out,

313
00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.700
but the disease is incurable.

314
00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:01.430
Go bear this letter to my lordof Lancaster,

315
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.070
this to the prince,

316
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.370
this to the earl ofWestmoreland,

317
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.100
and this to old mistress Ursula,

318
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.270
whom I have weekly sworn tomarry

319
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.000
since I perceived the firstwhite hair on my chin.

320
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
About it.

321
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.100
You know where to find me.

322
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:22.870
A pox of this gout or a gout ofthis pox,

323
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:26.400
for the one or the other playsthe rogue with my great toe.

324
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.730
Well, 'tis no matter if I dohalt.

325
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.570
I have the wars for my color,

326
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.170
and my pension shall seem themore reasonable.

327
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.800
A good wit will make use ofanything.

328
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.170
I will turn diseases tocommodity.

329
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:48.230
Thus have you heard our causeand known our means.

330
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.630
My most noble friends, I prayyou all,

331
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:54.470
speak plainly your opinions ofour hopes.

332
00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.600
Our present musters grow uponthe file

333
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.930
to 25,000 men of choice,

334
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.830
and our supplies live largely

335
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.570
in the hopes of greatNorthumberland,

336
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:10.370
whose bosom burns with anincensed fire of injuries.

337
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.100
The question then, LordHastings, standeth thus:

338
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.870
whether our present 25,000

339
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:21.130
may hold up head withoutNorthumberland?

340
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:22.630
With him, we may.

341
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.630
Aye, marry, there's the point.

342
00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:28.030
But if without him we be thoughttoo feeble,

343
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.270
my judgment is, we should notstep too far

344
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.730
till we had his assistance bythe hand.

345
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.100
For in a theme so bloody facedas this,

346
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:41.130
conjecture, expectation, andsurmise of aids incertain

347
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.100
should not be admitted.

348
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.500
Very true, Lord Bardolph,

349
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.800
for indeed it was youngHotspur's case at Shrewsbury.

350
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.270
It was, my lord, who linedhimself with hopes,

351
00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.770
eating the air on promise ofsupply,

352
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.730
flattering himself in project ofa power

353
00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.570
much smaller than the smallestof his thoughts.

354
00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:00.300
And so with great imaginationproper to madmen,

355
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.800
led his powers to death andwinking leaped into destruction.

356
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.570
But, by your leave, it never yetdid hurt

357
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:07.600
to lay down likelihoods andforms of hope.

358
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.800
I think we are a body strongenough,

359
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.030
even as we are, to equal withthe king.

360
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.070
What, is the king but 25,000?

361
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.330
To us no more.

362
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.370
Nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.

363
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.600
For his divisions, as the timesdo brawl,

364
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.370
Are in three heads:

365
00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.930
one power against the French andone against Glendower,

366
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.000
perforce the third must take upus.

367
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.630
So is the unfirm king in threedivided,

368
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.170
and his coffers sound withhollow poverty and emptiness.

369
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.300
That he should draw his severalstrengths together

370
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.730
and come against us in fullpuissance,

371
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.100
need not be dreaded.

372
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.530
Let us on and publish theoccasion of our arms.

373
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:52.430
The commonwealth is sick oftheir own choice.

374
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.070
Their overgreedy love hathsurfeited.

375
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.400
They that when Richard livedwould have him die

376
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.970
are now become enamored on hisgrave.

377
00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:04.730
Thou that threw'st dust upon hisgoodly head

378
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.630
when through proud London hecame sighing on

379
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:11.400
after the admired heels ofBolingbroke.

380
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.230
Shall we go draw our numbers andset on?

381
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.070
We are time's subjects, and timebids be gone.

382
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.370
Master Fang, have you enteredthe action?

383
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.630
It is entered.

384
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.570
Master Snare, we must arrest SirJohn Falstaff.

385
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.400
I pray you, since my action isentered

386
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.100
and my case so openly known tothe world,

387
00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.870
let Sir John be brought in tohis answer.

388
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.600
A hundred mark is a long one fora poor lone woman to bear,

389
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.170
and I have borne and borne andborne

390
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.370
and been fubbed off and fubbedoff and fubbed off

391
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:47.600
from this day to that day

392
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.400
that it is a shame to be thoughton.

393
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.530
There's no honesty in suchdealing,

394
00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.000
unless a woman should be made anass and a beast

395
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.700
to bear every knave's wrongs.

396
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.770
Yonder he comes,

397
00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.200
and that errant, malmsey noseknave, Bardolph, with him.

398
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.330
Do your office.

399
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.130
Do your office, Master Fang.

400
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.170
Do me, do me, do me your office.

401
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.330
How now.

402
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:08.330
What's the matter?

403
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.800
Whose mare's dead?

404
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.430
Sir John, I arrest you at thesuit of Mistress Quickly.

405
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.770
Away, varlets.

406
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:16.770
Draw, Bardolph.

407
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.030
Cut me off the villain's head.

408
00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.230
Throw the quean in the channel.

409
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.600
Throw me in the channel!

410
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.200
I'll throw thee in the channel.

411
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.200
Wilt thou?

412
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.200
Wilt thou?

413
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.130
Thou bastardly rogue!

414
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:30.000
Murder, murder!

415
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.830
Ah, thou honeysuckle villain.

416
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.600
Wilt thou kill God's messengersand the king's?

417
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:40.430
Oh, good people, send a rescueor two.

418
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.770
Wo't thou?

419
00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.970
Keep the peace here, ho!

420
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.830
My lord, be good to me.

421
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.970
I beseech you, stand to me.

422
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:50.800
How now, Sir John.

423
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.200
What are you brawling here?

424
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.800
Doth this become your time, yourplace, and business?

425
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.070
You should have been well onyour way to York.

426
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.900
My most worshipful lord,

427
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.170
an't please Your Grace that I'ma poor widow of Eastcheap,

428
00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.270
and he is arrested at my suit.

429
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.000
For what sum?

430
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.670
Well, 'tis more than for some,my lord.

431
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.430
It is for all, all I have.

432
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:13.530
He has eaten me out of house andhome.

433
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.470
He's put all my substance intothat fat belly of his.

434
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:18.900
How comes this, Sir John?

435
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.830
Are you not ashamed to enforce apoor widow

436
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.800
to so rough a course to come byher own?

437
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.870
What is the gross sum that I owethee?

438
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:32.470
If thou wert an honest man,thyself and the money too.

439
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:36.570
Thou didst swear upon aparcel-gilt goblet,

440
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.230
sitting in my Dolphin chamber atthe round table

441
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:43.200
before a sea coal fire onWednesday in Wheeson week,

442
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:47.200
when the prince broke thy headfor liking his father

443
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.470
to a singing man of Windsor,

444
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:53.670
thou didst swear, as I waswashing thy wound,

445
00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:57.230
to marry me and make me my ladythy wife.

446
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:59.230
Canst thou deny it?

447
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.470
And didst thou not kiss me

448
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.330
and bid me fetch thee 30shillings?

449
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.730
I put thee now to thy book oath.

450
00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.070
Deny it, if thou canst.

451
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:11.730
My lord, this is a poor, madsoul,

452
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.830
and she says up and down thetown

453
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.100
that her eldest son is like you.

454
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.730
She hath been in good case,

455
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.830
and the truth is, poverty hathdistracted her.

456
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.900
But for these foolish officers,

457
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.430
I beseech you I may have redressagainst them.

458
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.500
Sir John, Sir John, I am wellaware

459
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.000
of your manner of wrenching thetrue cause the false way.

460
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.970
It is not a confident brow northe throng of words,

461
00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.900
which come with such more thanimpudent sauciness from you,

462
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.130
can thrust me from a levelconsideration.

463
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.000
You have, so it appears to me,

464
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.300
practiced upon the easy yieldingspirit of this poor woman

465
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.070
and made her serve your usesboth in purse and in person.

466
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.570
Yea, good faith, my lord.

467
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:49.770
I pray you, peace.

468
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:51.730
Pay her the debt you owe her

469
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.630
and unpay the villainy you havedone with her.

470
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:56.670
The one you may do with sterlingmoney

471
00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.770
and the other with currentrepentance.

472
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:03.300
My lord, I will not undergo thissneap without reply.

473
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:07.200
You call honorable boldnessimpudent sauciness.

474
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.470
If a man will make courtesy andsay nothing, he is virtuous.

475
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:10.800
No, my good lord.

476
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.630
My humble duty remembered, Iwill not be your suitor.

477
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:14.770
I say to you that I do

478
00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:16.700
desire deliverance from theseofficers,

479
00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.530
being upon hasty employment inthe king's affairs.

480
00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:22.430
You speak as having power to dowrong,

481
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.570
but answer in the effect of yourreputation

482
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.400
and satisfy the poor woman.

483
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.970
Come hither, hostess.

484
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:28.970
Come hither.

485
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.630
My lord!

486
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.370
Master Gower, what news?

487
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.400
The king, my lord, and Harry,Prince of Wales,

488
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.630
are near at hand.

489
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:37.430
The rest the paper tells.

490
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:38.430
No more words on.

491
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.200
Faith, you said so before.

492
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.100
No more words; I'm a gentleman.

493
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.330
No more words on.

494
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.230
By this heavenly ground I treadon,

495
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.570
I will be fain to pawn

496
00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:51.570
both my plate and the tapestriesin my dining chambers.

497
00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.270
Let it be ten pound, if thoucanst.

498
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.470
No, no, no, no, no.

499
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:55.700
An't 'twere not for thy humors,

500
00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:56.930
there's not a better wench inEngland.

501
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.970
Go wash thy face and draw theaction.

502
00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:00.230
Go on.

503
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.600
I pray thee, Sir John, let it bebut 20 noble.

504
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.170
I would be loath to pawn myplate, so God save me.

505
00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:07.170
La!

506
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.170
Let it alone.

507
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:09.000
I'll make other shift.

508
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.170
You'll be a fool still.

509
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:14.300
Well, you shall have it, and Ipawn my gown.

510
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.770
I hope you'll come to supper.

511
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.170
You will pay me all together?

512
00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:20.330
Will I live?

513
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.500
Go with her, with her.

514
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.470
Hook on; hook on.

515
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:26.470
Will you have Doll Tearsheetcome meet you to supper?

516
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.330
No more words.

517
00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:29.430
Let's have her.

518
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.170
I have heard better news.

519
00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:34.600
What is the news, my lord?

520
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.700
Where lay the king tonight?

521
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.700
At Basingstoke, my lord.

522
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.700
I hope, my lord, all's well.

523
00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.700
What is the news, my lord?

524
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.070
Come all his forces back?

No, 1,500 foot, 500 horse aremarched up

against Northumberland and thearchbishop.

528
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:48.870
Comes the king back from Wales,my noble lord?

529
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.430
You shall have letters of mepresently.

530

What is the matter?

533
00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:58.770
Master Gower, shall I entreatyou to dinner with me?

534
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.770
I must wait upon my good lordhere.

539
00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.870
Will you sup with me, MasterGower?

540
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.130
What foolish master taught youthese manners, Sir John?

541
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.830
Master Gower, if they become menot,

542
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.570
he was a fool that taught themme.

543
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.570
This is the right fencing grace,my lord.

544
00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:21.970
Tap for tap, and so part fair.

545
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.030
May the Lord lighten thee.

546
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.970
Thou art a great fool.

547
00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:37.500
Before God, I'm exceeding weary.

548
00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:40.370
Is't come to that?

549
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.770
I had thought weariness durstnot have attached

550
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:44.200
one of so high blood.

551
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.530
Faith, it does me,

552
00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.170
though it discolors thecomplexion of my greatness

553
00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:49.730
to acknowledge it.

554
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:53.270
Doesn't it show vilely in me todesire small beer?

555
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:57.200
Why, a prince should not be soloosely studied

556
00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.470
as to remember so weak acomposition.

557
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.730
Belike then my appetite was notprincely got.

558
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.030
For, by my troth,

559
00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:06.430
I do now remember the poorcreature, small beer.

560
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.870
Indeed, these humbleconsiderations

561
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.900
make me out of love with mygreatness.

562
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.970
What a disgrace is it to me toremember thy name

563
00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.370
or to know thy face tomorrow

564
00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:23.270
or to take note how many pair ofsilk stockings thou hastó

565
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.700
viz these, and those that werethy peach-colored onesó

566
00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.270
or to bear the inventory of thyshirts,

567
00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:31.130
as one for superfluity andanother for use.

568
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:34.400
But that the tennis court keeperknows better than I,

569
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.930
for it is a low ebb of linenwith thee

570
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.700
when thou keepest not racketthere.

571
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.370
How ill it follows, after youhave labored so hard,

572
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.530
you should talk so idly.

573
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:49.300
Tell me, how many good, youngprinces would do so,

574
00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:53.400
their fathers being so sick asyours at this time is?

575
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.430
Shall I tell thee one thing,Poins?

576
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:56.930
Yes, faith,

577
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:58.770
and let it be an excellent, goodthing.

578
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:00.830
It shall serve among wits of nohigher breeding than thine.

579
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.000
Go to.

580
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.530
I stand the push of your onething you will tell.

581
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:05.000
Marry, I tell thee,

582
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.330
it is not meet that I should besad, now my father is sick.

583
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:11.770
Albeit I could tell to thee, asto one it pleases me,

584
00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:14.400
for fault of a better, to callmy friend,

585
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.370
I could be sad,

586
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:18.930
and sad indeed too.

587
00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.200
Very hardly upon such a subject.

588
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.530
By this hand, thou thinkest me

589
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.530
as far in devil's book as thouand Falstaff

590
00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.030
for obduracy and persistency.

591
00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:30.330
Let the end try the man.

592
00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:33.470
I tell thee, my heart bleedsinwardly,

593
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:35.570
my father is so sick.

594
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:37.530
And keeping such vile company asthou art

595
00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.870
hath in reason taken from me allostentation of sorrow.

596
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.500
The reason?

597
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.970
What wouldst thou think of me ifI should weep?

598
00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:50.700
Why, I would think thee a mostprincely hypocrite.

599
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.530
It would be every man's thought,

600
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.700
and thou art a blessed fellow tothink so as every man thinks.

601
00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.470
Never a man's thought in theworld

602
00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:00.300
keeps the roadway better thanthine.

603
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.630
Every man would think me ahypocrite indeed.

604
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.400
And what accites your mostworshipful thought to think so?

605
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:12.430
Why, because you have been solewd and engrafted to Falstaff.

606
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:14.000
And to thee.

607
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.030
By this light, I am well spokeon.

608
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:20.470
I can hear it with my own ears.

609
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.930
The worst they can say of me isthat I am a second brother

610
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.800
and that I am a proper fellow ofmy hands.

611
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.200
And those two things, I confess,I cannot help.

612
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.770
God save Your Grace.

613
00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:41.270
And yours, most noble Bardolph.

614
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.470
How doth thy master?

615
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:44.700
Well, my lord,

616
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.700
he hath heard of Your Gracecoming to town.

617
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.700
There's a letter for you.

618
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.270
Delivered with good respect.

619
00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.030
And how doth the martlemas, yourmaster?

620
00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.930
In bodily health, sir.

621
00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:01.430
Marry, the immortal part needs aphysician,

622
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.030
but that moves not him.

623
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.430
Though that be sick, it diesnot.

624
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.900
I do allow this wen to be

625
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.670
as familiar with me as my dog.

626
00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:11.000
And he holds his place, for lookyou how be writes.

627
00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:14.700
"Sir John Falstaff, knight,

628
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.300

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.300
"Harry, Prince of Wales,

greeting."

631
00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.470
Why, this is a certificate.

632
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:21.770
Peace.

633
00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:24.370
"I will imitate the honorableRomans in brevityó"

634
00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.800
He sure means brevity in breath,short-winded.

635
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:32.430
"I commend me to thee, I commendthee, and I leave thee.

636
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.630
"Be not too familiar with Poins,

"that he swears thou art tomarry his sister, Nell.

639
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:45.900
"Repent at idle times as thoumayest.

640
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.500
"And so farewell.

641
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.000
"Thine by yea and by no,

642
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.100
"which is as much as to say, asthou usest him,

643
00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.070
"Jack Falstaff with myfamiliars,

644
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.770
"John with my brothers andsisters,

and Sir John with all Europe."

646
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.230
My lord, I'll steep this letterin sack and make him eat it.

647
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:06.430
That's to make him eat 20 of hiswords.

648
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.230
Do you use me thus, Ned?

649
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.600
Must I marry your sister?

650
00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:14.600
God send the wench no worsefortune.

651
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.700
But I never said so.

652
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.270
Well, thus we play the foolswith the time,

653
00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:21.970
and the spirits of the wise sitin the clouds and mock us.

654
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:25.570
Is thou master here in town?

655
00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:26.630
Oh, yea, my lord.

656
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:27.800
Where sups he?

657
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.030
Doth the old boar feed at theold frank?

658
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:33.300
At the old place, my lord, inEastcheap.

659
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.470
What company?

660
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:37.730
Ephesians, my lord, of the oldchurch.

661
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:38.770
Sup any women with him?

662
00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.030
None, my lord,

663
00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:42.700
but old Mistress Quickly andMistress Doll Tearsheet.

664
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.200
What pagan may that be?

665
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.770
A proper gentlewoman, sir, and akinswoman of my master's.

666
00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.730
Even such kin as the parishheifers are to the town bull.

667
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:55.330
Shall we steal upon them, Ned,at supper?

668
00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:56.700
I am your shadow, my lord.

669
00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.270
I'll follow you.

670
00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:01.000
Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph,

671
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.430
no word to your master that I amyet come to town.

672
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.800
Here's for your silence.

673
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.770
I have no tongue, sir.

674
00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.100
And for mine, I will govern it.

675
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.100
Fare you well.

676
00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.100
Go.

677
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:16.500
This Doll Tearsheet should besome road.

678
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.400
I warrant you, as common as theroad

679
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.870
between Saint Alban's andLondon.

680
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.500
How might we see Falstaff bestowhimself tonight

681
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.600
in his true colors, and notourselves be seen?

682
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:30.430
Put on two leathern jerkins andaprons,

683
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.230
and wait upon his table asdrawers.

684
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.030
From a god to a bull?

685
00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.670
A heavy descension.

686
00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:40.170
It was Jove's case.

687
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:42.070
From a prince to a prentice?

688
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.300
A low transformation.

689
00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.730
That shall be mine,

690
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.900
for in everything the purposemust weigh with the folly.

691
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:50.930
Follow me, Ned.

692
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.570
I pray thee, loving wife andgentle daughter,

693
00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.500
give even way unto my roughaffairs.

694
00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.330
Put not you on the visage of thetimes

695
00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.030
and be like them to Percytroublesome.

696
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.630
I have given over.

697
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.200
I will speak no more.

698
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.300
Do what you will.

699
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.730
Your wisdom be your guide.

700
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.030
Alas, sweet wife, my honor is atpawn,

701
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.100
and, but my going, nothing canredeem it.

702
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.700
Oh, yet, for God's sake, go notto these wars.

703
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.330
The time was, Father, that youbroke your word,

704
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.000
when you were more endeared toit than now,

705
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
when your own Percy,

706
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.570
when my heart's dear Harry,

707
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:32.370
threw many a northward look tosee his father

708
00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.230
bring up his powers.

709
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.200
But he did long in vain.

710
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.730
Who then persuaded you to stayat home?

711
00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:52.870
There were two honors lost,yours and your son's.

712
00:31:52.870 --> 00:32:00.130
For yours, may the God of heavenbrighten it.

713
00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:04.170
For his, it stuck upon him

714
00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:08.030
as the sun in the gray vault ofheaven,

715
00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:12.600
and by his light did all thechivalry of England

716
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.270
move to do brave acts.

717
00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:18.700
He was indeed the glass

718
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.370
wherein the noble youth diddress themselves.

719
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:26.730
He had no legs that practicednot his gait.

720
00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:33.700
And speaking thick, which naturemade his blemish,

721
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.600
became the accents of thevaliant;

722
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.270
for those that could speak lowand tardily

723
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:45.400
would turn their own perfectionsto abuse,

724
00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.070
to seem like him.

725
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:56.530
So that in speech, in gait, indiet, in affections of delight,

726
00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:59.900
in military rules, humors ofblood,

727
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:05.300
he was the mark and glass, copyand book,

728
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.070
that fashioned others.

729
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.600
And himó

730
00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:17.330
oh, wondrous him,

731
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:21.430
oh, miracle of menó

732
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:26.500
him did you leave,

733
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:31.800
second to none, unseconded byyou,

734
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:37.630
to look upon the hideous god ofwar in disadvantage,

735
00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:43.230
to abide a field where nothingbut the sound of Hotspur's name

736
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:47.200
did seem defensible.

737
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.430
So you left him.

738
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:57.130
Never, oh, never, do his ghostthe wrong

739
00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:00.800
to hold your honor more preciseand nice

740
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.200
with others than with him.

741
00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:09.670
Let them alone.

742
00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:13.300
The marshal and the archbishopare strong.

743
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:23.230
Had my sweet Harry had but halftheir numbers,

744
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:27.270
today might I, hanging onHotspur's neck,

745
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:29.900
have talked of Monmouth's grave.

746
00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.130
Beshrew your heart.

747
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.170
Fair daughter, you do draw myspirits from me

748
00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:41.370
with new lamenting ancientoversights.

749
00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:43.030
But I must go and meet withdanger there,

750
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:44.700
or it will seek me in anotherplace

751
00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.270
and find me worse provided.

752
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.500
Oh, fly to Scotland,

753
00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:54.200
till that the nobles and thearmed commons

754
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.030
have of their puissance made alittle taste.

755
00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:00.970
If they get ground and vantageof the king,

756
00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:05.170
then join you with them, like arib of steel,

757
00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:07.130
to make strength stronger.

758
00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:14.170
But, for all our loves, firstlet them try themselves.

759
00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:16.630
So did your son.

760
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:20.030
He was so suffered.

761
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:21.670
So came I a widow

762
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:27.900
and never shall have length oflife enough

763
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:32.170
to rain upon remembrance withmine eyes,

764
00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:37.700
that it may grow and sprout ashigh as heaven,

765
00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:40.300
for recordation to my noblehusband.

766
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:44.400
'Tis with my mind as with thetide swelled up unto his height

767
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.300
that makes a stillstand, runningneither way.

768
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.930
Fain would I go to meet thearchbishop,

769
00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:52.700
but many thousand reasons holdme back.

770
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:58.200
I will resolve for Scotland.

771
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:02.570
There am I till time and vantagecrave my company.

772
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:09.600
I' faith, sweetheart,

773
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.870
methinks now you are in anexcellent good temperality.

774
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.700
Your pulsidge beats asextraordinarily

775
00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.830
as heart would desire,

776
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:19.000
and your color, I warrant you,

777
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.630
it's as red as any rose, in goodtruth, la!

778
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:26.370
But by faith, you have drunk toomuch canaries,

779
00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:28.870
and that's a marvelous searchingwine,

780
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:32.130
and it perfumes the blood ereone can say "What's this?"

781
00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:34.830
How do you now?

782
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:37.530
Better than I was.

783
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:41.070
Why, that's well said, a goodheart's worth gold.

784
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:42.330
Lo, here comes Sir John.

785
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:43.730
When Arthur first in courtó

786
00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:45.070
empty the jordan.

787
00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:47.270
How now, Mistress Doll.

788
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:49.830
Sick of a calm; yea, good faith.

789
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:51.400
So is all her sect.

790
00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.800
An they be once in a calm, theyare sick.

791
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.170
A pox, damn you.

792
00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.600
You muddy rascal.

793
00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.170
Is that all the comfort you giveme?

794
00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:02.770
You make fat rascals, MistressDoll.

795
00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:04.000
I make them?

796
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.330
Gluttony and diseases make them.

797
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:07.530
I make them not.

798
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:09.300
If the cook help to make thegluttony,

799
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.470
you help to make the diseases,Mistress Doll.

800
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:14.130
We catch of you, Doll; we catchof you.

801
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:16.470
Grant that, my poor virtue;grant that.

802
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:19.830
Hang yourself, you muddy conger.

803
00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:22.270
Hang yourself.

804
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:24.770
By my troth, this is the oldfashion.

805
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:28.470
You two never meet but you fallto some discord.

806
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:32.100
You are both, in good faith, asrheumatic as two dry toasts.

807
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:35.030
You cannot one won bear withanother's confirmities.

808
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.930
What the goodyear.

809
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:40.030
One must bear, and that must beyou.

810
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:44.200
You are the weaker vessel, asthey say, the emptier vessel.

811
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:49.900
Can a weak, empty vessel bearsuch a huge, full hogshead?

812
00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.770
There's a whole merchant'svessel

813
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.700
of Bourdeaux stuff in him.

814
00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:58.030
You have not seen a hulk betterstuffed in the hold.

815
00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:05.070
Come, I'll be friends with thee,Jack.

816
00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:07.470
Thou art going to the wars.

817
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.100
And whether I shall ever seethee again or no,

818
00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.430
there is nobody cares.

819
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:16.670
Sir, ancient Pistol is below andwould speak with you.

820
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:18.770
Hang him, swaggering rascal.

821
00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:20.070
Let him not come hither.

822
00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:22.470
It is the foul-mouthed'st roguein England.

823
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:25.170
If he swagger, let him not comehere.

824
00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:26.770
No, by my troth.

825
00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:28.570
I must live among my neighbors.

826
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:30.100
I'll no swaggerers.

827
00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.000
I am in good name and fame withthe very best.

828
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.170
Shut the door.

829
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:35.370
There comes no swaggerers here.

830
00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:38.930
I have not lived all this whileto have swaggering now.

831
00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:39.970
Shut the door, I pray you.

832
00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:41.430
Dost thou hear, hostess?

833
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:43.530
Pray you, pacify yourself, SirJohn.

834
00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:44.730
There comes no swaggerers here.

835
00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:45.800
Dost thou hear?

836
00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.100
It is mine ancient.

837
00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.670
Tilly-fally, Sir John.

838
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:52.400
Your ancient swaggerer comes notin my doors.

839
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.830
I was before Master Tisick, thedeputy, t'other day,

840
00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:57.270
and, as he said to me,

841
00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:00.770
'twas no longer ago thanWednesday last, by my faith.

842
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:02.930
"Neighbor Quickly," says he.

843
00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:06.230
Master Dumbe, our minister, wasby then.

844
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:08.600
"Neighbor Quickly," says he,

845
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.900
"Receive those that are civil,

846
00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.300
"for," said he, "you are in anill name."

847
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.170
Now a' said so, I can tellwhereupon.

848
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:16.330
"For," said he,

849
00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:18.570
"You are an honest woman andwell thought of.

850
00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:21.170
"Therefore take heed what guestsyou receive.

851
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:23.330
Receive no swaggeringcompanions."

852
00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:24.570
There comes none here.

853
00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.270
You would bless you to hear whathe said.

854
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:27.830
No, I'll no swaggerers.

855
00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:30.270
He's no swaggerer.

856
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:32.370
A tame cheater, i' faith.

857
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.670
You may stroke him as gentle asa puppy greyhound.

858
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:36.030
Call him up, Bardolph.

859
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.700
Cheater, call you him?

860
00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:42.100
I will bar no honest man myhouse, nor no cheater,

861
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.570
but I do not love swaggering.

862
00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:47.430
I am the worse, when one saysswagger.

863
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:50.030
Feel, masters, how I shake.

864
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:51.400
Oh, look you, I warrant you.

865
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.730
So you do, hostess.

866
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:54.100
Do I?

867
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.900
Yea, in good faith, do I, an'twere an aspen leaf.

868
00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:59.800
Oh, I cannot abide swaggerers.

869
00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.070
God save you, Sir John.

870
00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:02.200
Welcome, ancient Pistol.

871
00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.100
Pistol, I charge you with a cupof sack.

872
00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.030
Do you discharge upon minehostess?

873
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.530
I will discharge her, Sir John,with two bullets.

874
00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:10.930
She's Pistol-proof, sir.

875
00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.070
You shall not hardly offend her.

876
00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:15.730
Come, I'll drink no proofs norno bullets.

877
00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.900
I'll drink no more than will dome good

878
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.030

894
00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:13.330
God's light, with two points onyour shoulders?

895
00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:16.130
Much.

896
00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:19.330
God's my life, I will murder herruff for this.

897
00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:20.730
No more, Pistol.

898
00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:22.730
I would not have you go offhere.

899
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.230
Discharge yourself of ourcompany, Pistol.

900
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.430
No, Captain Pistol; not here,sweet captain.

901
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.230
Captain?

902
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:31.670
Thou abominable damned cheater,

903
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:34.770
art thou not ashamed to becalled captain?

904
00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:38.670
An captains were of my mind,they would truncheon you out

905
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:41.900
for taking their names upon youbefore you earned them.

906
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.570
You a captain?

907
00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:46.330
You slave, for what?

908
00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:49.400
For tearing a poor whore's ruffin a bawdy house?

909
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.070
He a captain.

910
00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:55.170
Hang him, rogue.

911
00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:59.430
He lives upon moldy stewedprunes and dried cakes.

912
00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:00.900
A captain.

913
00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.130
Therefore captains had need lookto it.

914
00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:04.970
Hark thee hither, Mistress Doll.

915
00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:05.970
Come.

916
00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:07.500
Good ancient.

917
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.170
Thou sayest, good ancient.

918
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:10.970
Well, IóI tell thee, CorporalBardolph,

919
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:12.600
I shall tear her.

920
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.100
I'll be revenged of her.

921
00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.170
Good Captain Pistol, be quiet.

922
00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.470
'Tis very late.

923
00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:20.100
I beseech you, aggravate yourcholer.

924
00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.370
These be good humors, indeed.

925
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:26.000
Shall packhorses and hollowpampered jades of Asia

926
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.370
that cannot go up 30 mile a day,

927
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:31.570
compare with Caesar and withcannibals and Trojan Greeks?

928
00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:34.000
Nay, rather damn them with KingCerberus,

929
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.630
and let the welkin roar.

930
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:38.530
Shall we fall foul for toys?

931
00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:43.900
By my troth, captain, these arebitter words.

932
00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:48.370
Then feed and be fat, my fairCalipolis.

933
00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:51.230
Come, give's some sack.

934
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:57.630
"Si fortune me tormente, speratome contento."

935
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:58.630
Pray thee, go down.

936
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:59.630
Go down.

937
00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:00.930
Fear we broadsides?

938
00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:02.570
No, the fiend give fire.

939
00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:10.630
Sweetheart, lie thou there.

940
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:12.830
What?

941
00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:16.030
We come to full points here, andare etceteras nothing?

942
00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:18.500
Pistol, I would be quiet.

943
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.930
Sweet knight, I kiss thy neaf.

944
00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.970
What, we have seen the sevenstars.

945
00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:24.130
For God's sake, thrust himdownstairs.

946
00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:26.970
I cannot endure such a fustianrascal.

947
00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:29.570
Thrust me down stairs?

948
00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:32.200
Quoit him down, Bardolph, like ashovegroat shilling.

949
00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.930
This will grow to a brawl anon.

950
00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:35.870
Pray you downstairs.

951
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:37.300
Shall we have incision?

952
00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.300
Shall we imbrue?

953
00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.600
Then death rock me asleep.

954
00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.370
Abridge my doleful days.

955
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:44.370
Why, then, let grievous,ghastly, gaping wounds

956
00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:46.070
untwine the Sisters Three.

957
00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:47.970
Come, Atropos, I say.

958
00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:49.770
This is goodly stuff toward.

959
00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.370
Boy, give me my rapier.

960
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:53.370
I pray thee, Jack.

961
00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:55.270
I pray thee, do not draw.

962
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:57.270
Get you downstairs.

963
00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:02.230
I'll forswear housekeeping

964
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:05.130
afore I'll be in these terretsand frights.

965
00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:11.470
I pray you, Jack, be quiet.

966
00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:12.930
The rascal's gone.

967
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:18.200
Ah, you whoreson, little valiantvillain, you.

968
00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:20.000
Are you not hurt i' the groin?

969
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.970
Methought a' made a shrewdthrust at your belly.

970
00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:24.470
Have you thrust him out o'doors?

971
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:26.230
Aye, Sir John.

972
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:27.830
The rascal's drunk.

973
00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:29.370
You hurt him, sir, in theshoulder.

974
00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:30.630
A rascal to brave me.

975
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:34.770
You sweet little rogue, you.

976
00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:38.730
Alas, poor ape, how thou sweats.

977
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.570
Come, let me wipe thy face.

978
00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:47.170
Come on, you whoreson chops.

979
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.830
I' faith, I love thee.

980
00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:56.730
Thou art as valorous as Hectorof Troy,

981
00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:58.830
worth five of Agamemnon,

982
00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:01.300
and ten times better than theNine Worthies.

983
00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:02.600
Ah, villain.

984
00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.700
A rascally slave.

985
00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.430
I'll toss the rogue in ablanket.

986
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.730
Do, an thou darest for thyheart.

987
00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:12.230
An thou dost, I'll canvass theebetween a pair of sheets.

988
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:13.230
The music is come, sir.

989
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:14.600
What?

990
00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:15.600
The music is come.

991
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.670
Well, let them play.

992
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:17.870
Play, sirs.

993
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:20.070
Come sit on my knee, Doll.

994
00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:22.970
A rascal bragging slave.

995
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:25.700
The rogue fled from me likequicksilver.

996
00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:26.770
I' faith,

997
00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:32.200
and thou followedst him likechurch.

998
00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:37.870
You whoreson, little, tidyBartholomew boar pig,

999
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:42.600
when wilt thou leave fighting o'days and foining o' nights,

1000
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:47.130
and begin to patch up thine oldbody for heaven?

1001
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:49.570
Peace, good Doll,

1002
00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:53.000
do not speak like adeath's-head.

1003
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.170
Do not bid me remember mine end.

1004
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:03.800
Sirrah, what humor's the princeof?

1005
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:08.000
A good, shallow young fellow

1006
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.230
who would have made a goodpantler,

1007
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:10.830
would ha' chipped bread well.

1008
00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:15.000
They say that Poins has a goodwit.

1009
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:15.770
He a good wit?

1010
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:17.000
Hang him, baboon.

1011
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.970
His wit's as thick as Tewksburymustard.

1012
00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:21.700
Why does the prince love him so,then?

1013
00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.200
Because their legs are both of abigness

1014
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.570
and a' plays at quoits well andswears with a good grace

1015
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:30.400
and such other gambol facultiesa' has

1016
00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.800
that show a weak mind and anable body.

1017
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.770
For the prince himself is suchanother.

1018
00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:37.030
The weight of a hair

1019
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:39.870
will turn the scales betweentheir avoirdupois.

1020
00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:45.030
Would not this nave of a wheelhave his ears cut off?

1021
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:47.100
Let's beat him before his whore.

1022
00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:51.130
Look, whether withered elder

1023
00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:54.170
hath not his poll clawed like aparrot.

1024
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:56.000
Is it not strange that desire

1025
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.600
should so many years outliveperformance?

1026
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.970
Kiss me, Doll.

1027
00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:07.900
Saturn and Venus this year inconjunction.

1028
00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.500
What says the almanac to that?

1029
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.630
Thou dost give me flatteringbusses.

1030
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:21.370
By my troth, I kiss thee with amost constant heart.

1031
00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:23.930
I am old.

1032
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:25.830
I am old.

1033
00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:28.100
I love thee better

1034
00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:33.730
than I love e'er a scurvy youngboy of them all.

1035
00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:38.200
What stuff wilt have a kirtleof?

1036
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:42.700
I shall receive money o'Thursday.

1037
00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:44.400
Shall have a cap tomorrow.

1038
00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:49.170
A merry song, come.

1039
00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:50.230
It grows late.

1040
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:51.600
We'll to bed.

1041
00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:58.430
Thou'lt forget me when I amgone.

1042
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:59.530
By my troth,

1043
00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:03.130
thou sets me a-weeping, an thousayest so.

1044
00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:06.670
Prove that ever I dress myselfhandsome till thy return.

1045
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:10.100
Well, harken at the end.

1046
00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.370
Some sack, Francis.

1047
00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:14.670
Anon, anon, sir.

1048
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.930
A bastard son of the king's.

1049
00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:22.000
And art not thou Poins, hisbrother?

1050
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.300
Why, thou globe of sinfulcontinents,

1051
00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.070
what a life dost thou lead.

1052
00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:27.170
A better than thou.

1053
00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:28.470
I'm a gentleman; thou art adrawer.

1054
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:29.500
Very true, sir,

1055
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.800
and I come to draw you out bythe ears.

1056
00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.170
Oh, the Lord bless that sweetface of thine.

1057
00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:37.070
Oh, Jesu, are you come fromWales?

1058
00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:39.900
Thou whoreson mad compound ofmajesty,

1059
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:43.170
by this light flesh and corruptblood, thou art welcome.

1060
00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:43.930
Hold, you fat fool.

1061
00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:45.200
I scorn you.

1062
00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.000
My lord, he will drive you outof your revenge

1063
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.770
and turn all to a merriment, ifyou take not the heat.

1064
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:54.000
You whoreson candle-mine, you.

1065
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.170
How vilely did you speak of meeven now

1066
00:48:56.170 --> 00:49:01.330
before this honest, virtuous,civil gentlewoman.

1067
00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:05.330
Oh, now, God's blessing on yourgood heart.

1068
00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:06.770
So she is, by my troth.

1069
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:07.770
Didst thou hear me?

1070
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:11.370
Yea, and you knew me,

1071
00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:15.070
as you did when you ran away byGadshill.

1072
00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:16.330
You knew I was at your back

1073
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:18.900
and spoke it on purpose to trymy patience.

1074
00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.700
No, no, no; not so.

1075
00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:22.830
No, I did not think thou wastwithin hearing.

1076
00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:25.630
I shall drive thee then toconfess the willful abuse,

1077
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:27.070
and then I know how to handleyou.

1078
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:28.630
No abuse, Hal.

1079
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:30.170
On mine honor, no abuse.

1080
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:31.770
Not to dispraise me

1081
00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:34.130
and call me pantler and breadchipper

1082
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:35.370
and I know not what.

1083
00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:36.500
No abuse, Hal.

1084
00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:37.530
No abuse?

1085
00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:39.630
No abuse, Ned, i' the world.

1086
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:42.170
No, no, none.

1087
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:44.700
No, I dispraised him before thewicked

1088
00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:47.070
that the wicked might not fallin love with thee,

1089
00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:48.830
in which doing, I have done thepart

1090
00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:50.600
of a careful friend and a truesubject,

1091
00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.900
and thy father is to give methanks for it.

1092
00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:54.630
No abuse, Hal.

1093
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:55.630
None, Ned, none.

1094
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:57.230
No, faith, boys, none.

1095
00:49:57.230 --> 00:50:00.700
See now, whether pure fear orentire cowardice

1096
00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.530
doth not make thee wrong thisvirtuous gentlewoman

1097
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:05.070
to close with us?

1098
00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:07.430
Is she of the wicked?

1099
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:10.100
Is thine hostess here of thewicked

1100
00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.070
or thy boy of the wicked

1101
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:13.230
or honest Bardolph,

1102
00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:15.400
whose zeal burns in his nose, ofthe wicked?

1103
00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.600
Answer, thou dead elm; answer.

1104
00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.800
The fiend hath pricked downBardolph irrecoverable,

1105
00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.330
and his face is Lucifer's privykitchen,

1106
00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:27.430
where he does nothing but roastmaltworms.

1107
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:31.570
For the boy, well, there's agood angel about him,

1108
00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:33.570
but the devil outbids him too.

1109
00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:35.030
For the women?

1110
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:36.870
For one of them, she's in hellalready

1111
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:39.430
and burns poor souls.

1112
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:42.030
For the other, I owe her money,

1113
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:44.900
and whether she be damned forthat, I know not.

1114
00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:46.500
No, I warrant.

1115
00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:50.600
Who knocks so loud at door?

1116
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.600
Peto.

1117
00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:52.600
My lord!

1118
00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:53.500
How now, Peto.

1119
00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:54.630
What's the news?

1120
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:56.230
The king your father is atWestminster,

1121
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.200
and there are 20 weak andwearied posts

1122
00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.130
come from the north.

1123
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:03.270
And as I came along, I met andovertook a dozen captains,

1124
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:05.700
bareheaded, sweating, knockingat the taverns,

1125
00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:07.430
and asking everyone for Sir JohnFalstaff.

1126
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.830
By heaven, Poins, I very much toblame,

1127
00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:14.770
so idly to profane the precioustime.

1128
00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:16.800
Give me my sword and cloak.

1129
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.270
Falstaff, good night.

1130
00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:26.270
Oh, now, now comes in thesweetest morsel of the night,

1131
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:29.330
and we must hence and leave itunpicked.

1132
00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:30.370
Oh, more knocking.

1133
00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:31.370
How now.

1134
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:32.370
What's the matter?

1135
00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:33.570
You must to court presently.

1136
00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:37.170
A dozen captains stay at doorfor you.

1137
00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:38.170
Farewell, hostess.

1138
00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:39.670
Farewell, Doll.

1139
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:42.900
You see, my good wenches, howmen of merit are sought after.

1140
00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:45.630
The undeserver may sleep whenthe man of action is called on.

1141
00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:47.100
Farewell.

1142
00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:51.530
If I be not sent away post, Iwill see you again ere I go.

1143
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:53.030
I cannot speak.

1144
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:55.870
If my heart be not ready toburstó

1145
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:59.470
oh, sweet Jack, have a care ofthyself.

1146
00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:00.700
Farewell.

1147
00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.430
Farewell.

1148
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:03.830
Fare thee well.

1149
00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:05.530
Farewell.

1150
00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:10.830
I've known thee 29 years comepeascod time,

1151
00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:14.530
and an honester, truer-heartedman

1152
00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:17.370
well, fare thee well.

1153
00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:56.970
How many thousand of my poorestsubjects

1154
00:52:56.970 --> 00:52:59.730
are at this hour asleep.

1155
00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:07.670
Oh, sleep; oh, gentle sleep,

1156
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:10.270
nature's soft nurse,

1157
00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:13.700
how have I frighted thee

1158
00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:18.530
that thou no more wilt weigh myeyelids down

1159
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:22.530
and steep my senses inforgetfulness?

1160
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:33.070
Why rather, sleep, liest thou insmoky cribs,

1161
00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:36.730
upon uneasy pallets stretchingthee

1162
00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:42.970
and hushed with buzzing nightflies to thy slumber,

1163
00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:48.030
than in the perfumed chambers ofthe great,

1164
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:51.430
under the canopies of costlystate,

1165
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:55.600
and lulled with sound ofsweetest melody?

1166
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:14.730
Oh, thou dull god,

1167
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:22.630
why liest thou with the vile inloathsome beds

1168
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:24.670
and leav'st the kingly couch

1169
00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:29.270
a watchcase or a common larumbell?

1170
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:42.530
Wilt thou, upon the high andgiddy mast,

1171
00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:46.430
seal up the shipboy's eyes

1172
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:48.270
and rock his brains

1173
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:53.470
in cradle of the rude, imperioussurge

1174
00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:56.300
and in the visitation of thewinds,

1175
00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.200
who take the ruffian billows bythe top,

1176
00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:02.130
curling their monstrous heads

1177
00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:09.100
and hanging them with deafingclamor in the slippery clouds,

1178
00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:12.630
that, with the hurly, deathitself awakes?

1179
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:22.000
Canst thou, oh, partial sleep,

1180
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.130
give thy repose to the wetseaboy in an hour so rude,

1181
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:34.770
and in the calmest and moststillest night,

1182
00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:39.470
with all appliances and means toboot,

1183
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:42.170
deny it to a king?

1184
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:49.830
Then happy low, lie down.

1185
00:55:51.830 --> 00:55:55.600
Uneasy lies the head that wearsa crown.

1186
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:01.700
Many good morrows to YourMajesty.

1187
00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:06.530
Is it good morrow, lords?

1188
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:09.330
'Tis 1:00, and past.

1189
00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:11.270
Why, then, good morrow to youall, my lords.

1190
00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:16.670
Have you read o'er the lettersthat I sent you?

1191
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:19.200
We have, my liege.

1192
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:22.270
Then you perceive the body ofour kingdom,

1193
00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:24.600
how foul it is;

1194
00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:26.500
what rank diseases grow,

1195
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:29.630
and with what danger, near theheart of it.

1196
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:32.300
It is but as a body yetdistempered,

1197
00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.330
who to his former strength maybe restored

1198
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:36.430
with good advice and littlemedicine.

1199
00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:38.970
My lord Northumberland will soonbe cooled.

1200
00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.570
Oh, God.

1201
00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:46.800
That one might read the book offate

1202
00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:51.700
and see the revolution of thetimes make mountains level

1203
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.200
and the continent, weary ofsolid firmness,

1204
00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.600
melt itself into the sea.

1205
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:02.930
And, other times, to see

1206
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:08.570
the beachy girdle of the oceantoo wide for Neptune's hips.

1207
00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:12.430
How chances mock

1208
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:17.030
and changes fill the cup ofalteration with divers liquors.

1209
00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:21.700
Oh, if this were seen,

1210
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:27.900
the happiest youth, viewing hisprogress through,

1211
00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:33.100
what perils past, what crossesto ensue,

1212
00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:37.570
would shut the book, and sit himdown and die.

1213
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:47.600
'Tis not ten years gone sinceRichard and Northumberland,

1214
00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:52.200
great friends, did feasttogether,

1215
00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:56.430
and in two years after were theyat wars.

1216
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:57.800
It is but eight years

1217
00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:02.370
since this Percy was the mannearest my soul,

1218
00:58:02.370 --> 00:58:05.370
who, like a brother, toiled inmy affairs

1219
00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:09.500
and laid his love and life undermy foot.

1220
00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:10.730
Yea, for my sake,

1221
00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:16.030
even to the eyes of Richard gavehim defiance.

1222
00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:17.570
But which of you was byó

1223
00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:22.300
you, cousin Nevil, as I mayrememberó

1224
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:26.100
when Richard, with his eyebrimful of tears,

1225
00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:29.770
then checked and rated byNorthumberland,

1226
00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:34.330
did speak these words, nowproved a prophecy?

1227
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:39.170
"Northumberland, thou ladder bythe which

1228
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:43.900
my cousin Bolingbroke ascends mythroneó"

1229
00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:46.770
though then, God knows, I had nosuch intent,

1230
00:58:46.770 --> 00:58:49.370
but that necessity so bowed thestate

1231
00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:53.070
that I and greatness werecompelled to kiss.

1232
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:57.700
"The time shall come," thus didhe follow it,

1233
00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:04.230
"The time will come, that foulsin, gathering head,

1234
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:09.900
shall break into corruption," sowent on,

1235
00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:12.370
foretelling this same time'scondition

1236
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:14.230
and the division of our amity.

1237
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:17.000
There is a history in all men'slives,

1238
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.630
figuring the natures of thetimes deceased.

1239
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:22.600
The which observed, a man mayprophesy with a near aim

1240
00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:25.570
of the main chance of things asyet not come to light,

1241
00:59:25.570 --> 00:59:28.930
which in their seeds and weakbeginnings lie entreasured.

1242
00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:31.370
Such things become the hatch andbrood of time.

1243
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:34.630
And by the necessary form ofthis,

1244
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:36.700
King Richard might create aperfect guess

1245
00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:39.700
that great Northumberland, thenfalse to him,

1246
00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:43.100
would of that seed grow to agreater falseness,

1247
00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:46.170
which should not find a groundto root upon, unless on you.

1248
00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:50.670
Are these things, then,necessities?

1249
00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:54.700
Then let us meet them likenecessities.

1250
00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:59.200
And that same word even nowcries out on us.

1251
00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.600
They say the bishop andNorthumberland

1252
01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.730
are 50,000 strong.

1253
01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:05.670
It cannot be, my lord.

1254
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:07.700
Rumor doth double, like thevoice and echo,

1255
01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.230
the numbers of the feared.

1256
01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:14.030
Please it, Your Grace, to go tobed.

1257
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:15.100
Upon my soul, my lord,

1258
01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:16.600
the powers you already have sentforth

1259
01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.870
will bring this prize in veryeasily.

1260
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:20.300
To comfort you the more,

1261
01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:23.700
I have received a certaininstance that Glendower is dead.

1262
01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:28.870
Your Majesty hath been thisfortnight ill,

1263
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:32.670
and these unseasoned hours mustadd perforce

1264
01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:34.300
unto your sickness.

1265
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:38.200
I will take your counsel.

1266
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:47.300
And were these inward wars onceout of hand,

1267
01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:52.100
we would, dear lords, unto theHoly Land.

1268
01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:02.000
Come on; come on; come on, sir.

1269
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.900
Give me your hand, sir.

1270
01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.600
Give me your hand, sir.

1271
01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.600
An early stirrer, by the rood.

1272
01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.830
And how doth my good cousinSilence?

1273
01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:14.670
Good morrow, good cousinShallow.

1274
01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:16.830
And how doth my cousin, yourbedfellow,

1275
01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:23.130
and your fairest daughter andmine, my goddaughter Ellen?

1276
01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:27.230
Alas, a black ousel, cousinShallow.

1277
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:29.400
By yea and nay.

1278
01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:33.300
I daresay my cousin William isbecome a good scholar.

1279
01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.170
He is at Oxford still, is henot?

1280
01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:38.100
Indeed, sir, to my cost.

1281
01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.770
A' must, then, to the inns o'court shortly.

1282
01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:42.730
I was once of Clement's Inn,

1283
01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:46.170
where I think they will talk ofmad Shallow yet.

1284
01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:49.400
You were called "lusty Shallow"then, Cousin.

1285
01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.070
By the mass, I was calledanything.

1286
01:01:51.070 --> 01:01:54.970
And I would have done anythingindeed, too, and roundly too.

1287
01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:59.600
There was I and little John Doitof Staffordshire

1288
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.400
and black George Barnes andFrancis Pickbone

1289
01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:07.970
and Will Squele, a Cotswold man.

1290
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:10.300
You had not four such swingebucklers

1291
01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.300
in all the inns o' court again.

1292
01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:13.900
And I may say to you,

1293
01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:17.330
we knew where the bona-robaswere

1294
01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:22.370
and had the best of them all atcommandment.

1295
01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:26.530
Then was Jack Falstaff, now SirJohn,

1296
01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:31.470
a boy and page to ThomasMowbray, Duke of Norfolk.

1297
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:33.100
This Sir John, Cousin,

1298
01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:35.630
that comes hither anon aboutsoldiers?

1299
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:37.630
The same Sir John; the verysame.

1300
01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:40.670
I see him break Skogan's head atthe court gate

1301
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:42.470
when a' was a crack not thushigh.

1302
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:43.770
And the very same day

1303
01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:48.770
did I fight with one SampsonStockfish, a fruiterer,

1304
01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:51.270
behind Gray's Inn.

1305
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:55.530
Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that Ihave spent.

1306
01:02:55.530 --> 01:02:59.530
And to see how many of my oldacquaintance are dead.

1307
01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:02.170
We shall all follow, Cousin.

1308
01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:04.830
Certain, 'tis certain; verysure, very sure.

1309
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:08.070
Death, as the Psalmist saith, iscertain to all.

1310
01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:09.830
All shall die.

1311
01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:12.730
How a good yoke of bullocks atStamford fair?

1312
01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:15.300
By my troth, I was not there.

1313
01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:17.800
Death is certain.

1314
01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:22.330
Is old Double of your townliving yet?

1315
01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:23.370
Dead, sir.

1316
01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:26.070
Jesu, Jesu, dead.

1317
01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:28.630
A' drew a good bow, and dead.

1318
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:29.630
Dead.

1319
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:31.330
A' shot a fine shoot.

1320
01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:34.870
John a Gaunt loved him well andbetted much money on his head.

1321
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:36.070
Dead.

1322
01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:39.470
A' would clap you in the cloutat 12 score

1323
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:44.230
and carried you a forehand shafta 14, a 14 1/2,

1324
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:47.530
that it would have done a man'sheart good to see.

1325
01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:49.730
How a score of ewes now?

1326
01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:52.870
Thereafter as they be.

1327
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:56.930
A score of good ewes may beworth ten pounds.

1328
01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:59.000
And is old Double dead?

1329
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.070
Here comes one of Sir JohnFalstaff's men, as I think.

1330
01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.270
Good morrow, honest gentlemen.

1331
01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:15.600
I beseech you, which is MasterJustice Shallow?

1332
01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:20.970
I am Robert Shallow, sir; a pooresquire of this county,

1333
01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:24.030
and one of the king's justicesof the peace.

1334
01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:25.930
What is your good pleasure withme?

1335
01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:28.930
My captain, sir, commends him toyou.

1336
01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:32.930
My captain, Sir John Falstaff,

1337
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:38.400
a tall gentleman, by heaven, anda most gallant soldier.

1338
01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.470
He greets me well.

1339
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:41.430
I knew him a good backsword man.

1340
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:42.930
How doth the good knight?

1341
01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:45.730
And may I ask how my lady hiswife doth?

1342
01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:51.630
Sir, pardon.

1343
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:55.330
A soldier is better accommodatedthan with a wife.

1344
01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:01.170
That is very good, i' faith; andit is very good indeed too.

1345
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:03.430
Better accommodated.

1346
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:07.100
It is good; yea, indeed, is it.

1347
01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:11.900
Good phrases surely are, andever were, very commendable.

1348
01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:14.300
Accommodated.

1349
01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:16.730
It comes from "accommodo."

1350
01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:18.630
Very good; a good phrase.

1351
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:20.500
Pardon me, sir; I have heard theword.

1352
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.300
Phrase call you it?

1353
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.670
By this good day, I know not thephrase,

1354
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:26.000
but I will maintain the word

1355
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.400
with my sword to be asoldierlike word,

1356
01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.570
by heaven, and a word ofexceeding good command.

1357
01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:33.130
By heaven.

1358
01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:36.170
Here comes good Sir John.

1359
01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:39.430
Give me your hand, sir.

1360
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:42.500
Give me Your Worship's goodhand.

1361
01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:49.400
By my troth, you like well, andyou bear your years very well.

1362
01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.300
Welcome, good Sir John.

1363
01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:55.730
I am glad to see you well, goodMaster Robert Shallow.

1364
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:58.170
Master Surecard, as I think?

1365
01:05:58.170 --> 01:05:59.230
No.

1366
01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:02.430
No, Sir John, it is my cousinSilence

1367
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:04.100
in commission with me.

1368
01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:06.100
Good Master Silence,

1369
01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:08.770
it well befits you should be ofthe peace.

1370
01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:12.030
Your good Worship is welcome.

1371
01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:13.630
Why, fie, gentlemen.

1372
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:15.470
This is hot weather.

1373
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:18.670
Have you provided me here half adozen sufficient men?

1374
01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:19.900
Marry, have we, sir.

1375
01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:20.900
Will you sit?

1376
01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:23.170
Well, I beseech you, let me seethem.

1377
01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:24.370
Where's the roll?

1378

Where's the roll?

1379
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:26.370
Where's the roll?

1380
01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:28.200
Let me see; let me see; let mesee.

1381
01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.770
So, so, so, so.

1382

Yea, marry, sir.

1384
01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.100
Let them appear as I call.

1385
01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:38.070
Let them do so; let them do so.

1386

Ralph Mouldy.

1387
01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:41.630
Where is Mouldy?

1388

Here, an't please you.

1389
01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:45.500
What think you, Sir John?

1390
01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.630
A good-limbed fellow:

1391
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:50.270
young, strong, and of goodfriends.

1392
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:52.430
Is thy name Mouldy?

1393
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:54.370
Yea, an't please you.

1394
01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:57.500
'Tis the more time thou wertused.

1395
01:06:58.670 --> 01:07:01.770
Most excellent, i' faith.

1396
01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:05.070
Things that are moldy lack use.

1397
01:07:05.070 --> 01:07:06.930
Very singular good, Sir John.

1398
01:07:06.930 --> 01:07:08.230
Well said, i' faith, Sir John.

1399
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:09.700
Very well said.

1400
01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:10.800
Prick him.

1401
01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.130
I was pricked well enoughbefore,

1402
01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:14.670
an you could have let me alone.

1403
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:16.270
My old dame will be undone now

1404
01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:18.400
for one to do her husbandry andher drudgery.

1405
01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.070
You need not to have pricked me.

1406
01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:21.900
There are other men fitter to goout than I.

1407
01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:22.900
Go to; go to.

1408
01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:23.970
Peace, Mouldy; you shall go.

1409
01:07:23.970 --> 01:07:25.400
Mouldy, it is time you werespent.

1410
01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.570
Spent.

1411
01:07:26.570 --> 01:07:27.630
Peace, fellow, peace.

1412
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:28.630
Stand aside.

1413
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:30.130
Know you where you are?

1414
01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:35.100
Yes, well, for the other, let meseeó

1415
01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:36.700
Simon Shadow.

1416
01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:38.300
Let me have him to sit under.

1417
01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.200
He's like to be a cold soldier.

1418
01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:43.600
Where's Shadow?

1419
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:48.330
Here, sir.

1420
01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:51.030
Whose son art thou, Shadow?

1421
01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:57.000
Myómy mother's son, sir.

1422
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.170
Thy mother's son.

1423
01:07:58.170 --> 01:08:01.630
Like enough, and thy father'sshadow.

1424
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:03.370
Do you like him, Sir John?

1425
01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:04.570
Shadow will serve for summer.

1426
01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:07.770
Prick him.

1427
01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:09.530
Thomas Wart.

1428
01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:10.530
Wart?

1429
01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:11.730
Where's he?

1430
01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:12.900
Here, sir.

1431
01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:15.330
Is thy name Wart?

1432
01:08:15.330 --> 01:08:16.870
Yea, sir.

1433
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:19.800
Thou art a very ragged wart.

1434
01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.000
Shall I prick him, Sir John?

1435
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.630
It were superfluous,

1436
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:24.530
for his apparel is built uponhis back,

1437
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:27.570
and the whole frame stands uponpins.

1438
01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:29.600
Prick him no more.

1439
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.130
You can do it, Sir John; you cando it.

1440
01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:35.030
I commend you well.

1441
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:36.630
Francis Feeble.

1442
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:37.930
Here, sir.

1443
01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:39.770
What trade art thou, Feeble?

1444
01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:41.130
A woman's tailor, sir.

1445
01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:42.130
Oh.

1446
01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:43.330
Shall I prick him, Sir John?

1447
01:08:43.330 --> 01:08:45.100
Well, you may, but if he'd beena man's tailor,

1448
01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:46.170
he'd ha' pricked you.

1449
01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.900
Wilt thou make as many holes inan enemy's battle

1450
01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:55.070
as thou hast done in a woman'spetticoat?

1451
01:08:58.370 --> 01:09:00.370
I will do my good will, sir.

1452
01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:01.870
You can have no more.

1453
01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:04.030
Well said, good woman's tailor.

1454
01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:06.230
Well said, courageous Feeble.

1455
01:09:06.230 --> 01:09:07.500
Thou wilt be as valiant

1456
01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:11.630
as the wrathful dove or mostmagnanimous mouse.

1457
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:13.200
Prick the woman's tailor.

1458
01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:16.570
Well, Master Shallow; deep,Master Shallow.

1459
01:09:16.570 --> 01:09:18.400
Who's next?

1460
01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.130
Peter Bullcalf of the green.

1461
01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:21.430
Yea, marry, let me see Bullcalf.

1462
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:22.630
Here, sir.

1463
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:24.000
'Fore God, there's a likelyfellow.

1464
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.830
Here, prick me Bullcalf till heroar again.

1465
01:09:25.830 --> 01:09:26.870
Oh, Lord.

1466
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:28.000
Good my lord captainó

1467
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.830
Dost thou roar before thou artpricked?

1468
01:09:29.830 --> 01:09:31.170
Oh, Lord, sir.

1469
01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:32.830
I am a diseased man.

1470
01:09:32.830 --> 01:09:35.270
Oh, now what disease hast thou?

1471
01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:37.870
A whoreson cold, sir.

1472
01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:39.500
Oh.

1473
01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.300
Oh.

1474
01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:44.370
A cough, sir, which I got withringing in the king's affairs

1475
01:09:44.370 --> 01:09:45.600
upon his coronation day.

1476
01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.730
Come, come.

1477
01:09:46.730 --> 01:09:49.270
Thou shalt go to the wars in agown.

1478
01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:51.300
We'll have away thy cold.

1479
01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:52.870
And I will take such order

1480
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:55.730
that thy friends shall ring forthee.

1481
01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:03.530
Is here all?

1482
01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:05.930
Here is two more called thanyour number, Sir John.

1483
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:07.830
You must have but four here,sir.

1484
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:12.100
And so, I pray you, go in withme to dinner.

1485
01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:14.170
Come, I'll go drink with you,but I cannot tarry dinner.

1486
01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:17.670
By my troth, I'm glad to seeyou, good Master Robert Shallow.

1487
01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:23.330
Oh, Sir John, do you remembersince we lay all night

1488
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:26.070
in the windmill in SaintGeorge's field?

1489
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:27.870
No more of that, Master Shallow.

1490
01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:28.930
No more of that.

1491
01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:33.530
'Twas a merry night.

1492
01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:38.370
And is Jane Nightwork alive?

1493
01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:40.930
She lives, Master Shallow.

1494
01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:42.470
She never could away with me.

1495
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:43.900
Never, no, no.

1496
01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:47.000
She would always say she couldnot abide Master Shallow.

1497
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.970
By the mass, I would anger herto the heart.

1498
01:10:50.170 --> 01:10:53.200
She was then a bona-roba.

1499
01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:56.930
Doth she hold her own well?

1500
01:10:56.930 --> 01:11:00.400
Old, old, Master Shallow.

1501
01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.700
Nay, she must be old.

1502
01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.230
She cannot choose but be old.

1503
01:11:04.230 --> 01:11:05.400
Certain she's old

1504
01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.130
and had Robin Nightwork by OldNightwork

1505
01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:09.870
before I came to Clement's Inn.

1506
01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:13.070
That's 55 years ago.

1507
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:15.000
Cousin Silence, that you hadseen that

1508
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.300
that this knight and I haveseen.

1509
01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.700
Said I well, Sir John?

1510
01:11:20.570 --> 01:11:23.900
We have heard the chimes atmidnight, Master Shallow.

1511
01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:26.030
That we have.

1512
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:28.370
That we have; that we have.

1513
01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:30.700
I' faith, Sir John, we have.

1514
01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:37.200
Our watchword was "Hem boys."

1515
01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:40.570
Come, let's to dinner; come,let's to dinner.

1516
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:44.430
Oh, Jesus, the days that we havespent.

1517
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:46.500
Hem boys.

1518
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:10.870
Good Master Corporal Bardolph,stand my friend.

1519
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:15.770
Here's four Harry ten shillingsin French crowns for you.

1520
01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:18.330
In very truth, sir, I had aslief be hanged, sir, as go.

1521
01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:20.100
And yet, for mine own part, sir,I do not care.

1522
01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:21.630
But rather, because I amunwilling,

1523
01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:24.570
and, for mine own part, have adesire to stay with my friends.

1524
01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:26.700
Else I do not care, for mine ownpart, so much, sir.

1525
01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:30.470
Go to; stand aside.

1526
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:33.570
And, good Master CorporalCaptain,

1527
01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:36.400
for my old dame's sake, stand myfriend.

1528
01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:39.730
She has nobody to do anythingabout her when I am gone;

1529
01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:42.430
and she is old and cannot helpherself.

1530
01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:46.800
You shall have 40, sir.

1531
01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:49.670
Go to.

1532
01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:50.930
Stand aside.

1533
01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:57.270
By my troth, I care not; a mancan die but once.

1534
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:59.070
We owe God a death.

1535
01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:01.500
I'll ne'er bear a base mind.

1536
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:05.770
An't be my destiny, so; an't benot, so.

1537
01:13:05.770 --> 01:13:08.330
No man's too good to serve'sprince.

1538
01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:10.330
And let it come when it will.

1539
01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:13.870
If a man die this year, he isquit of it the next.

1540
01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:15.330
Well said.

1541
01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:16.730
Thou art a good fellow.

1542
01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:18.930
Faith, I'll bear no base mind.

1543
01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:23.830
Which men shall I have?

1544
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:25.400
Four of which you please.

1545
01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.630
Sir, a word with you.

1546
01:13:27.630 --> 01:13:31.200
I have three pounds to freeMouldy and Bullcalf.

1547
01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.200

1548
01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.370
Well.

1549
01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:35.370
Come, Sir John, which four willyou have?

1550
01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:37.370
Do you choose for me.

1551
01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:40.270
Marry, then, Bullcalfó

1552
01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:44.430
Bullcalf, Mouldy, Shadow, andFeeble.

1553
01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:46.430
Mouldy and Bullcalf.

1554
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:48.830
For you, Mouldy, stay at hometill you are past service.

1555
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:52.400
And for your part, Bullcalf,grow till you come unto it.

1556
01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.670
I'll none of you.

1557
01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:56.230
Sir John, Sir John, do notyourself wrong.

1558
01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:57.770
They are your likeliest men.

1559
01:13:57.770 --> 01:13:59.430
I would have you served with thebest.

1560
01:13:59.430 --> 01:14:04.470
Will you tell me, MasterShallow, how to choose a man?

1561
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:07.830
Care I for the limb, the thews,the stature, bulk,

1562
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:11.030
and big assemblance of a man?

1563
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:13.100
Give me the spirit, MasterShallow.

1564
01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:15.700
Here, take Wart.

1565
01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:18.530
You see what a ragged appearanceit has.

1566
01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:20.070
A' shall charge you,

1567
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:22.430
discharge you with the motion ofa pewterer's hammer.

1568
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:24.530
And this same half-faced fellow,Shadow.

1569
01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:27.400
Give me this man, for hepresents no mark to the enemy.

1570
01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:31.000
The foeman may with as great aimlevel at the edge of a penknife.

1571
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.630
And for a retreat,

1572
01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:37.570
how swiftly will this Feeble,the woman's tailor, run off.

1573
01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:42.600
Oh, give me the spare men, andspare me the great ones.

1574
01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.400
Bardolph, put me a caliver intoWart's hand.

1575
01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:51.930
Wart, traverse; thus, thus,thus.

1576
01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:53.600
Come, manage me your caliver.

1577
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:55.900
So.

1578
01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:56.900
Very well.

1579
01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:58.730
Go to.

1580
01:14:58.730 --> 01:14:59.770
Very good.

1581
01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:01.800
Exceeding good.

1582
01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:06.100
Oh, give me always a little,lean, old, chapped, bald shot.

1583
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.130
Well said, Wart.

1584
01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:11.870
Thou art a good scab.

1585
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:15.700
Hold, there's a tester for thee.

1586
01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:17.270
He is not his craft's master.

1587
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:18.900
He doth not do it right.

1588
01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:22.070
I remember in Mile End Green,when I lay at Clement's Innó

1589
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:24.470
I was then Sir Dagonet inArthur's showó

1590
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:25.930
we had a little quiver fellow

1591
01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:29.570
who would manage you his piecethus.

1592
01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:35.630
And about and about, and comeyou in and come you in.

1593
01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:39.200
And "rah-tah-tah," would a' say,and "bounce" would a' say,

1594
01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.430
and away again would a' go, andagain would a' come.

1595
01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:52.470
These fellows will do well,Master Shallow.

1596
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:55.870
One, twoócome onó three, four.

1597
01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:00.130
God keep you, Master Silence.

1598
01:16:00.130 --> 01:16:02.570
I will not use many words withyou.

1599
01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:04.570
Gentlemen both, farewell.

1600
01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:05.570
I thank you.

1601
01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:08.000
I must a dozen miles tonight.

1602
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.800
Bardolph, lead the men away.

1603
01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:10.500
Hey, hup.

1604
01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:12.000
Hey, hup.

1605
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.130
Hup, aye, hup, aye, hup, aye,hup, aye, hup, aye, hup, aye.

1606
01:16:18.130 --> 01:16:20.270
The Lord bless you, Sir John.

1607
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:22.470
God prosper your affairs.

1608
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:23.930
God send us peace.

1609
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:25.370
Oh, God send us peace.

1610
01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:27.270
Now return visit our house.

1611
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:30.430
Let our old acquaintance berenewed.

1612
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:33.900
Peradventure I will with you tothe court.

1613
01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:35.800
'Fore God, I would you would.

1614
01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:36.930
Go to.

1615
01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:38.300
I have spoke at a word.

1616
01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.030
As it isó

1617
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:41.400
God keep you, Sir John.

1618
01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:42.430
God keep you.

1619
01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:43.430
May God keep you.

1620
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:44.430
Farewell.

1621
01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:47.670
Fare you well, gentle gentlemen.

1622
01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:59.030
As I return,

1623
01:16:59.030 --> 01:17:03.730
I will fetch off these justices.

1624
01:17:03.730 --> 01:17:10.730
I do see the bottom of JusticeShallow.

1625
01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:17.870
Lord, Lord, how subject we oldmen are to this vice of lying.

1626
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:23.600
This same starved justice hathdone nothing but prate to me

1627
01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.170
of the wildness of his youth

1628
01:17:25.170 --> 01:17:28.930
and the feats he hath done aboutTurnbull Streetó

1629
01:17:28.930 --> 01:17:33.900
and every third word a lie.

1630
01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:37.070
I do remember him at Clement'sInn

1631
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:41.000
like a man made after supper ofa cheeseparing.

1632
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.100
When a' was naked, he was, forall the world,

1633
01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:46.830
like a forked radish

1634
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:50.730
with a head fantastically carvedupon it with a knife.

1635
01:17:50.730 --> 01:17:52.700
A' was the very genius offamine,

1636
01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:55.300
yet lecherous as a monkey.

1637
01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:59.230
And the whores called himmandrake.

1638
01:17:59.230 --> 01:18:04.700
And now is this vice's daggerbecome a squire

1639
01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:06.830
and talks as familiarly of Johna Gaunt

1640
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:09.430
as if he'd been sworn brother tohim,

1641
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:12.500
and I'll be sworn he never sawhim but once in the tiltyard,

1642
01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:13.630
and then he broke his head

1643
01:18:13.630 --> 01:18:16.430
for crowding among the marshal'smen.

1644
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:18.930
And now has he land and beefs.

1645
01:18:18.930 --> 01:18:26.730
Well, I'll be acquainted withhim, if I return.

1646
01:18:26.730 --> 01:18:31.930
If the young dace be a bait forthe old pike,

1647
01:18:31.930 --> 01:18:37.600
I see no reason in the laws ofnature but I may snap at him.

1648
01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:43.470
Let time shape, and there anend.

1649
01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:54.130
My friends and brethren in thesegreat affairs...

1650
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:02.500
I must acquaint you that I havereceived

1651
01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.300
new dated letters fromNorthumberland,

1652
01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:09.300
their cold intent, tenor, andsubstance thus:

1653
01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:11.200
here doth he wish his person,

1654
01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.930
with such powers as might holdsortance with his quality,

1655
01:19:13.930 --> 01:19:16.530
the which he could not levy,

1656
01:19:16.530 --> 01:19:20.400
whereupon he is retired, to ripehis growing fortunes,

1657
01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.830
to Scotland,

1658
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:23.300
and concludes in hearty prayers

1659
01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.830
that your attempts may overlive

1660
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:27.300
the hazard and fearful meetingof their opposite.

1661
01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:29.000
Thus do the hopes we have in him

1662
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.200
touch ground and dash themselvesto pieces.

1663
01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.570
Now, what news?

1664
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:35.030
West of this forest, scarcelyoff a mile,

1665
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:37.330
in goodly form come on theenemy.

1666
01:19:37.330 --> 01:19:39.030
And by the ground they hide,

1667
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:42.670
I judge their number in or nearthe rate of 30,000.

1668
01:19:42.670 --> 01:19:44.970
The just proportion that we gavethem out.

1669
01:19:44.970 --> 01:19:48.000
Let us sway on and face them inthe field.

1670
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.770
Health and fair greeting fromour general,

1671
01:19:50.770 --> 01:19:55.000
the prince, Lord John, and dukeof Lancaster.

1672
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.270
Say on, my lord of Westmoreland,in peace.

1673
01:19:58.270 --> 01:20:00.730
What doth concern your coming?

1674
01:20:07.530 --> 01:20:10.270
Then, my lord,

1675
01:20:10.270 --> 01:20:13.300
unto Your Grace do I in chiefaddress

1676
01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:16.000
the substance of my speech.

1677
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.270
You, lord archbishop,

1678
01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:23.070
wherefore do you so illtranslate yourself

1679
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:26.800
out of the speech of peace whichbears such grace

1680
01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:30.500
into the harsh and boisteroustongue of war,

1681
01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:35.000
turning your books to graves,your ink to blood,

1682
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.500
your pens to lances, and yourtongue divine

1683
01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.130
to a loud trumpet and a point ofwar?

1684
01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:42.830
Wherefore do I this?

1685
01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:46.300
So the question stands.

1686
01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:50.500
Briefly, to this end.

1687
01:20:51.970 --> 01:20:55.130
We are all diseased,

1688
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:57.130
and with our surfeiting andwanton hours

1689
01:20:57.130 --> 01:20:59.870
have brought ourselves into aburning fever,

1690
01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:03.170
and we must bleed for itó

1691
01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:11.000
of which disease our late king,Richard, being infected, died.

1692
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:20.630
I have in equal balance justlyweighed

1693
01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:23.970
what wrongs our arms may do,what wrongs we suffer,

1694
01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:27.570
and find our griefs heavier thanour offences.

1695
01:21:27.570 --> 01:21:30.030
We see which way the stream oftime doth run

1696
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:32.770
and are enforced from our mostquiet there

1697
01:21:32.770 --> 01:21:35.300
by the rough torrent of occasion

1698
01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:36.900
and have the summary of all ourgriefs,

1699
01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:39.770
when time shall serve, to showin articles,

1700
01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:42.700
which long ere this we offeredto the king

1701
01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:44.930
and might by no suit gain ouraudience.

1702
01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:48.030
When we are wronged and wouldunfold our griefs,

1703
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:51.000
we are denied access unto hisperson

1704
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.930
even by those men that most havedone us wrong.

1705
01:21:54.930 --> 01:21:57.970
When ever yet was your appealdenied?

1706
01:21:57.970 --> 01:22:01.870
Wherein have you been galled bythe king?

1707
01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:04.970
What peer hath been suborned tograte on you

1708
01:22:04.970 --> 01:22:08.230
that you should seal thislawless bloody book

1709
01:22:08.230 --> 01:22:10.630
of forged rebellion with a sealdivine

1710
01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:13.270
and consecrate commotion'sbitter edge?

1711
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:15.130
My brother general, thecommonwealth

1712
01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:17.400
I make my quarrel in particular.

1713
01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:20.230
There is no need of any suchredressó

1714
01:22:20.230 --> 01:22:22.630
or if there were, it not belongsto you.

1715
01:22:22.630 --> 01:22:24.330
Why not to him in part,

1716
01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:27.970
and to us all that feel thebruises of the days before,

1717
01:22:27.970 --> 01:22:29.970
and suffer the conditions ofthese times

1718
01:22:29.970 --> 01:22:33.170
to lay a heavy and unequal handupon our honors?

1719
01:22:33.170 --> 01:22:37.130
Oh, my good Lord Mowbray,

1720
01:22:37.130 --> 01:22:39.470
construe the times to theirnecessities

1721
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:41.430
and you shall see indeed,

1722
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:45.230
it is the time and not the kingthat doth your injuries.

1723
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:50.130
But this is mere digression frommy purpose.

1724
01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:57.730
Here come I from our princelygeneral to know your griefs,

1725
01:22:57.730 --> 01:23:02.470
to tell you from His Grace thathe will give you audience,

1726
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:08.370
and wherein it shall appear thatyour demands are just,

1727
01:23:08.370 --> 01:23:09.670
you shall enjoy them...

1728
01:23:12.570 --> 01:23:16.870
everything set off that might somuch as think you enemies.

1729
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.070
Then take, my lord ofWestmoreland,

1730
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:29.500
this schedule,

1731
01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:32.130
for this contains our generalgrievances.

1732
01:23:36.130 --> 01:23:38.600
This will I show the general.

1733
01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.800
Let it please you, lords,

1734
01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:42.730
in sight of both our battles wemay meet,

1735
01:23:42.730 --> 01:23:46.470
and either end in peace, whichGod so frame,

1736
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:47.970
or to the place of difference,

1737
01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:51.100
call the swords, which mustdecide it.

1738
01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:53.430
My lord, we will do so.

1739
01:23:57.530 --> 01:23:59.370
There is a thing within my bosomtells me

1740
01:23:59.370 --> 01:24:01.970
that no conditions of our peacecan stand.

1741
01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.830
Fear you not that.

1742
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:07.770
If we can make our peace uponsuch large terms and so absolute

1743
01:24:07.770 --> 01:24:10.170
as our conditions shall consistupon,

1744
01:24:10.170 --> 01:24:13.400
our peace shall stand as firm asrocky mountains.

1745
01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:17.830
Yea, but our valuation shall besuch

1746
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:21.130
that every slight and falsederived cause,

1747
01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:24.700
yea, every idle, nice, andwanton reason

1748
01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:28.300
shall to the king taste of thisaction;

1749
01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:32.300
that, were our royal faithsmartyrs in love,

1750
01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:34.770
we shall be winnowed with sorough a wind

1751
01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:37.830
that even our corn will seem aslight as chaff

1752
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:39.970
and good from bad find nopartition.

1753
01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:41.130
No, no, my lord.

1754
01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:42.530
Note this.

1755
01:24:42.530 --> 01:24:46.230
The king is weary of dainty andsuch picking grievances,

1756
01:24:46.230 --> 01:24:48.600
for he hath found to end onedoubt by death

1757
01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.600
revives two greater in the heirsof life.

1758
01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.500
Besides, the king hath wastedall his rods

1759
01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:55.000
on late offenders,

1760
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.070
that he now doth lack the veryinstruments of chastisement,

1761
01:24:58.070 --> 01:25:01.070
so that his power, like to afangless lion,

1762
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:03.570
may offer, but not hold.

1763
01:25:03.570 --> 01:25:05.070
'Tis very true.

1764
01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:07.070
And therefore be assured, mygood lord marshal,

1765
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:09.670
if we do now make our atonementwell,

1766
01:25:09.670 --> 01:25:12.430
our peace will, like a brokenlimb united,

1767
01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:14.600
grow stronger for the breaking.

1768
01:25:18.170 --> 01:25:19.830
Be it so.

1769
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:21.900
Here returns my lord ofWestmoreland.

1770
01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:24.930
The prince is here at hand.

1771
01:25:24.930 --> 01:25:27.100
Pleaseth your lordship to meetHis Grace

1772
01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:29.600
just distance twixt our armies.

1773
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:57.530
You are well encounter'd here,my cousin Mowbray.

1774
01:25:57.530 --> 01:26:00.800
Good day to you, gentle lordarchbishop,

1775
01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:03.930
And so to you, Lord Hastings,and to all.

1776
01:26:03.930 --> 01:26:07.830
My lord of York, it bettershowed with you

1777
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:10.530
when that your flock, assembledby the bell,

1778
01:26:10.530 --> 01:26:12.170
encircled you to hear with thereverence

1779
01:26:12.170 --> 01:26:14.930
your exposition on the holy text

1780
01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:19.100
than now to see you here an ironman,

1781
01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:21.230
cheering a rout of rebels withyour drum,

1782
01:26:21.230 --> 01:26:26.300
turning the word to sword andlife to death.

1783
01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:27.500
Oh, who shall believe

1784
01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:31.000
but you misuse the reverence ofyour place,

1785
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.930
employ the countenance and graceof heaven

1786
01:26:33.930 --> 01:26:36.230
as a false favorite doth hisprince's name,

1787
01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:37.630
in deeds dishonorable?

1788
01:26:37.630 --> 01:26:41.400
You have ta'en up, under thecounterfeited zeal of God,

1789
01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.230
the subjects of his substitute,my father,

1790
01:26:44.230 --> 01:26:46.500
and both against the peace ofheaven and him

1791
01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:48.270
have here upswarmed them.

1792
01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:49.830
Good my lord of Lancaster,

1793
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:52.100
I am not here against yourfather's peace,

1794
01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:54.430
but, as I told my lord ofWestmoreland,

1795
01:26:54.430 --> 01:26:58.200
the time misordered doth, incommon sense,

1796
01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.670
crowd us and crush us to thismonstrous form,

1797
01:27:00.670 --> 01:27:03.400
to hold our safety up.

1798
01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:06.370
I sent Your Grace the parcelsand particulars of our grief,

1799
01:27:06.370 --> 01:27:09.270
the which hath been with scornshoved from the court,

1800
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:12.970
whereon this Hydra son of war isborn,

1801
01:27:14.670 --> 01:27:18.470
whose dangerous eyes may well becharmed asleep

1802
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:23.400
with grant of our most just andright desires.

1803
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:29.630
Pleaseth Your Grace to answerthem directly

1804
01:27:29.630 --> 01:27:32.900
how far forth you do like theirarticles.

1805
01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:38.170
I like them all and do allowthem well

1806
01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:41.170
and swear here, by the honor ofmy blood,

1807
01:27:41.170 --> 01:27:43.500
my father's purposes have beenmistook,

1808
01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.330
and some about him have toolavishly

1809
01:27:45.330 --> 01:27:46.930
wrested his meaning andauthority.

1810
01:27:46.930 --> 01:27:50.830
My lord, these griefs shall bewith speed redressed.

1811
01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:53.270
Upon my soul, they shall.

1812
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:54.600
If this may please you,

1813
01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:57.200
discharge your powers unto theirseveral countiesó

1814
01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.200
My lordó

1815
01:27:58.200 --> 01:27:59.200
As we will ours.

1816
01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.000
And here between the armies

1817
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.370
let's drink together friendlyand embrace,

1818
01:28:03.370 --> 01:28:06.370
that all their eyes may bearthose tokens home

1819
01:28:06.370 --> 01:28:10.270
of our restored love and amity.

1820
01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:17.270
I take your princely word forthese redresses.

1821
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:20.800
I give it you and will maintainmy word.

1822
01:28:23.630 --> 01:28:26.200
And thereupon I drink unto YourGrace.

1823
01:28:33.670 --> 01:28:36.430
Go, Captain, and deliver to thearmy this news of peace.

1824
01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:37.800
Let them have pay, and part.

1825
01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:39.170
I know it will well please them.

1826
01:28:39.170 --> 01:28:40.430
Hie thee, Captain.

1827
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:43.800
To you, my noble lord ofWestmoreland.

1828
01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.770
I pledge Your Grace.

1829
01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:48.330
And, if you knew what pains Ihad bestowed

1830
01:28:48.330 --> 01:28:49.900
to breed this present peace,

1831
01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:51.700
you would drink freely.

1832
01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:55.000
But my love to you shall showitself more openly hereafter.

1833
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.130
I do not doubt you.

1834
01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:57.770
I am glad of it.

1835
01:28:57.770 --> 01:29:00.530
Health to my lord and gentlecousin, Mowbray.

1836
01:29:00.530 --> 01:29:02.830
You wish me health in very happyseason,

1837
01:29:02.830 --> 01:29:05.730
for I am, on the sudden,something ill.

1838
01:29:05.730 --> 01:29:08.430
Against ill chances men are evermerry,

1839
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:10.600
but heaviness foreruns the goodevent.

1840
01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:12.770
Therefore be merry, coz,

1841
01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:14.830
since sudden sorrow serves tosay thus,

1842
01:29:14.830 --> 01:29:17.470
"Some good thing comestomorrow."

1843
01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:19.730
Believe me, I am passing lightin spirit.

1844
01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:22.430
The more, the worse, if your ownrule be true.

1845
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:25.700
The word of peace is rendered.

1846
01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:27.770
Hark, how they shout.

1847
01:29:27.770 --> 01:29:30.530
This had been cheerful aftervictory.

1848
01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:33.000
A peace is in the nature of aconquest,

1849
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.770
for then both parties nobly aresubdued,

1850
01:29:35.770 --> 01:29:38.730
and neither party loser.

1851
01:29:38.730 --> 01:29:41.370
Go, my lord, and let our army bedischarged too.

1852
01:29:44.970 --> 01:29:48.470
And, good my lord, so pleaseyou, let our trains march by us,

1853
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:52.030
that we may peruse the men weshould have coped withal.

1854
01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:53.300
Go, good Lord Hastings,

1855
01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:56.600
and, ere they be dismissed, letthem march by.

1856
01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:01.500
I trust, lords, we shall lietonight together.

1857
01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:06.200
Now, Cousin, wherefore standsour army still?

1858
01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:10.800
The leaders, having charge fromyou to stand,

1859
01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:13.570
will not go off until they hearyou speak.

1860
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.330
They know their duties.

1861
01:30:17.330 --> 01:30:20.630
My lord, our army is dispersedalready.

1862
01:30:20.630 --> 01:30:22.130
Like youthful steers unyoked,

1863
01:30:22.130 --> 01:30:24.470
they take their courses east,west, north, south;

1864
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:26.100
or, like a school broke up,

1865
01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:28.530
each hurries towards his homeand sporting place.

1866
01:30:28.530 --> 01:30:31.600
Good tidings, my Lord Hastings,

1867
01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:34.570
for the which I do arrest thee,traitor, of high treason.

1868
01:30:34.570 --> 01:30:37.730
And you, Lord Archbishop, andyou, Lord Mowbray,

1869
01:30:37.730 --> 01:30:39.530
of capitol treason I attach youboth.

1870
01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:41.100
Is this proceeding just andhonorable?

1871
01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:42.900
Is your assembly so?

1872
01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:45.970
Will you thus break your faith?

1873
01:30:45.970 --> 01:30:47.900
I pawned thee none.

1874
01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.130
I promised you redress

1875
01:30:49.130 --> 01:30:51.770
of these same grievances whereofyou did complain,

1876
01:30:51.770 --> 01:30:53.000
which, by mine honor,

1877
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.430
I will perform with a mostChristian care.

1878
01:30:57.430 --> 01:31:00.170
But for you, rebels, look totaste

1879
01:31:00.170 --> 01:31:03.130
the due meet for rebellion andsuch acts as yours.

1880
01:31:03.130 --> 01:31:05.200
Most shallowly did you thesearms commence,

1881
01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:08.200
fondly brought here andfoolishly sent hence.

1882
01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:09.200
Strike up our drums.

1883
01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:11.700
Pursue the scattered stray.

1884
01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:17.200
God, and not we, hath safelyfought today.

1885
01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:55.400
What is your name, sir?

1886
01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:57.730
Of what condition are you and ofwhat place?

1887
01:31:57.730 --> 01:32:01.500
I am a knight, sir, and my nameis Colevile of the dale.

1888
01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:03.030
Well, then, Colevile is yourname

1889
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:06.200
and knight is your degree andyour place the dale.

1890
01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:07.930
Colevile shall still be yourname,

1891
01:32:07.930 --> 01:32:09.530
a traitor your degree,

1892
01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:12.670
and the dungeon your place, aplace deep enough.

1893
01:32:12.670 --> 01:32:15.730
So should you be still Colevileof the dale.

1894
01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:18.800
Are not you Sir John Falstaff?

1895
01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.370
As good a man as he, sir,whoever I am.

1896
01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:24.000
Do ye yield, sir, or shall Isweat for you?

1897
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.600
I think you are Sir JohnFalstaff,

1898
01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.670
and in that thought yield me.

1899
01:32:30.530 --> 01:32:31.770
Here comes our general.

1900
01:32:31.770 --> 01:32:32.900
Come, hie thee, sir.

1901
01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:35.930
The heat is past; follow nofurther now.

1902
01:32:35.930 --> 01:32:37.630
Call in the powers, good cousinWestmoreland.

1903
01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:43.800
Now, Falstaff, where have youbeen all this while?

1904
01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:46.030
When everything is ended, thenyou come.

1905
01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:48.000
These tardy tricks of yourswill, on my life,

1906
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.130
one time or other break somegallows' back.

1907
01:32:50.130 --> 01:32:53.570
I would be sorry, my lord, butit should be thus.

1908
01:32:53.570 --> 01:32:57.030
I never knew yet but rebuke andcheque was the reward of valor.

1909
01:32:57.030 --> 01:33:01.400
Do you think me a swallow, anarrow, or a bullet?

1910
01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:02.970
Have I, in my old and poormotion,

1911
01:33:02.970 --> 01:33:05.000
the expedition of thought?

1912
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.470
I have speeded hither

1913
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:09.030
with the very extremest inch ofpossibility.

1914
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:11.070
And here, travel tainted as Iam,

1915
01:33:11.070 --> 01:33:14.670
have in my pure and immaculatevalor,

1916
01:33:14.670 --> 01:33:18.400
taken Sir John Colevile of thedale,

1917
01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:21.800
a most furious knight andvalorous enemy.

1918
01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:23.170
But what of that?

1919
01:33:23.170 --> 01:33:24.930
He saw me and yielded,

1920
01:33:24.930 --> 01:33:26.930
that I may justly say,

1921
01:33:26.930 --> 01:33:29.300
with the hooknosed fellow ofRome,

1922
01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:32.130
"I came, saw, and overcame."

1923
01:33:32.130 --> 01:33:34.800
It was more of his courtesy thanyour deserving.

1924
01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.570
I know not.

1925
01:33:36.570 --> 01:33:39.530
Here he is, and here I yieldhim.

1926
01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:41.130
And I beseech Your Grace,

1927
01:33:41.130 --> 01:33:44.370
let it be booked with the restof this day's deeds,

1928
01:33:44.370 --> 01:33:47.330
or, by the Lord, I'll have it ina particular ballad else,

1929
01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:49.230
with mine own picture on the topon't,

1930
01:33:49.230 --> 01:33:51.070
Colevile kissing my foot.

1931
01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:53.870
Therefore let me have right, andlet desert mount.

1932
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:55.130
Thine's too heavy to mount.

1933
01:33:55.130 --> 01:33:57.330
Well, let it shine, then.

1934
01:33:57.330 --> 01:33:58.800
Thine's too thick to shine.

1935
01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:02.000
Well, let it do something, mygood lord,

1936
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.530
that will do me good, and callit what you will.

1937
01:34:07.530 --> 01:34:08.930
Is thy name Colevile?

1938
01:34:08.930 --> 01:34:10.630
It is, my lord.

1939
01:34:10.630 --> 01:34:12.630
A famous rebel art thou,Colevile.

1940
01:34:12.630 --> 01:34:15.100
And a famous true subject tookhim.

1941
01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:18.370
I am, my lord, but as my bettersare that led me hither.

1942
01:34:18.370 --> 01:34:20.300
Had they been ruled by me,

1943
01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:22.330
you should have won them dearerthan you have.

1944
01:34:22.330 --> 01:34:24.100
How they sold themselves, I knownot,

1945
01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:27.170
but thou, like a kind fellow,gavest thyself away gratis.

1946
01:34:27.170 --> 01:34:29.100
And I thank thee for thee.

1947
01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:31.400
Send Colevile with hisconfederates to York,

1948
01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:34.870
to present execution.

1949
01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:41.000
And now dispatch we toward thecourt, my lords.

1950
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000
I hear the king my father issore sick.

1951
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.070
Our news shall go before us toHis Majesty,

1952
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:48.130
which, Cousin, you shall bear tocomfort him,

1953
01:34:48.130 --> 01:34:50.830
and we with sober speed willfollow you.

1954
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:52.500
My lord, I beseech you,

1955
01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:54.900
give me leave to go throughGloucestershire.

1956
01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:56.600
And when you come to court,

1957
01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:59.570
stand, my good lord, in yourgood report.

1958
01:34:59.570 --> 01:35:02.930
Fare you well, Falstaff.

1959
01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:06.370
I, in my condition, shall betterspeak of you than you deserve.

1960
01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:09.800
I would you had but the wit.

1961
01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:11.570
'Twere better than your dukedom.

1962
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:16.670
Good faith,

1963
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:25.900
this same young, sober-bloodedboy doth not love me,

1964
01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:28.430
nor a man cannot make him laugh.

1965
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:30.670
That's no marvel.

1966
01:35:30.670 --> 01:35:32.070
He drinks no wine.

1967
01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:39.100
There's never none of thesedemure boys comes to any proof,

1968
01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:45.470
for thin drink doth so overcooltheir blood

1969
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:48.630
and making many fish meals

1970
01:35:48.630 --> 01:35:54.100
that they fall into a kind ofmale greensickness.

1971
01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:56.870
And then when they marry, theyget wenches.

1972
01:35:59.270 --> 01:36:02.630
They are generally fools andcowards,

1973
01:36:02.630 --> 01:36:06.630
which some of us would be, too,but for inflammation.

1974
01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:13.400
A good sherris sack hath atwofold operation.

1975
01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:18.500
It ascends me into the brain;

1976
01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:20.170
dries me there all the foolish

1977
01:36:20.170 --> 01:36:23.430
and dull and curdy vapors whichenviron it;

1978
01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:26.400
makes it apprehensive, quick,forgetive,

1979
01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:30.100
full of nimble, fiery, anddelectable shapes;

1980
01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:32.970
which, delivered o'er to thevoice,

1981
01:36:32.970 --> 01:36:38.270
the tongue, which is the birth,becomes excellent wit.

1982
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:42.800
The second property of yourexcellent sherris

1983
01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:48.430
is the warming of the blood,which, before cold and settled,

1984
01:36:48.430 --> 01:36:52.070
left the liver white and pale,

1985
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:55.200
which is the badge ofpusillanimity and cowardice.

1986
01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:57.570
But the sherris warms it,

1987
01:36:57.570 --> 01:37:02.530
makes it course from the inwardsto the parts extreme.

1988
01:37:02.530 --> 01:37:07.030
It illumineth the face, which asa beacon gives warning

1989
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:10.670
to all the rest of this littlekingdom, man, to arm.

1990
01:37:10.670 --> 01:37:17.200
And then the vital commoners andinland petty spirits

1991
01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:19.900
muster me all to their captain,the heart,

1992
01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:22.570
who, great and puffed up withthis retinue,

1993
01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:24.800
doth any deed of courage.

1994
01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:28.900
And this valor comes of sherris.

1995
01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:34.170
So that skill in the weapon isnothing without sack,

1996
01:37:34.170 --> 01:37:36.070
for that sets it awork,

1997
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:42.530
and learning a mere hoard ofgold kept by a devil,

1998
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:46.770
till sack commences it and setsit in act and use.

1999
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.470
Hereof comes it that PrinceHarry is valiant,

2000
01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:57.900
for the thin blood

2001
01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:01.300
which he did naturally inheritfrom his father,

2002
01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:07.570
he hath, like lean, sterile, andbare land,

2003
01:38:07.570 --> 01:38:13.770
manured and husbanded and tilledwith excellent endeavor

2004
01:38:13.770 --> 01:38:17.870
of drinking good and good storeof fertile sherris,

2005
01:38:17.870 --> 01:38:21.200
that he is become very hot andvaliant.

2006
01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:23.730
If I had a thousand sons,

2007
01:38:23.730 --> 01:38:27.200
the first humane principle Iwould teach them should be

2008
01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:33.130
to forswear thin potations andaddict themselves to sack.

2009
01:38:33.770 --> 01:38:35.000
Captain!

2010
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.100
Captain!

2011
01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:39.230
Captain!

2012
01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:45.230
The army is discharged all andgone.

2013
01:38:47.770 --> 01:38:51.170
Let them go.

2014
01:38:51.170 --> 01:38:54.800
I'll through Gloucestershire,

2015
01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:02.700
and there will I visit MasterRobert Shallow, esquire.

2016
01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:07.730
I have him already temperingbetween my finger and my thumb,

2017
01:39:07.730 --> 01:39:10.200
and shortly will I seal withhim.

2018
01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:12.270
Come, away.

2019
01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:41.800
Now, lords, if God doth givesuccessful end

2020
01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:46.730
to this debate that bleedeth atour doors,

2021
01:39:46.730 --> 01:39:51.500
we will our youth lead on tohigher fields

2022
01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:54.770
and draw no swords but what aresanctified.

2023
01:39:56.630 --> 01:40:00.600
Our navy is addressed, our powercollected,

2024
01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:04.400
our substitutes in absence wellinvested,

2025
01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:07.700
and everything lies level to ourwish.

2026
01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:15.230
Only, we lack a little personalstrength;

2027
01:40:15.230 --> 01:40:18.700
and pause us till these rebels,now afoot,

2028
01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:21.200
come underneath the yoke ofgovernment.

2029
01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:27.000
Of both which we doubt not butYour Majesty shall soon enjoy.

2030
01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:36.330
Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,

2031
01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:37.930
where is the prince yourbrother?

2032
01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:42.470
I think he's gone to hunt, mylord, at Windsor.

2033
01:40:43.930 --> 01:40:45.530
And how accompanied?

2034
01:40:46.570 --> 01:40:47.770
I do not know, my lord.

2035
01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:52.400
Is not his brother, Thomas ofClarence, with him?

2036
01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:55.270
No, my good lord; he is inpresence here.

2037
01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.700
What would my lord and father?

2038
01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:08.630
Nothing but well to thee, Thomasof Clarence.

2039
01:41:10.530 --> 01:41:14.370
How chance thou art not with theprince thy brother?

2040
01:41:14.370 --> 01:41:20.130
He loves thee, and thou dostneglect him, Thomas.

2041
01:41:20.130 --> 01:41:22.730
Thou hast a better part in hisaffection

2042
01:41:22.730 --> 01:41:25.030
than all thy brothers.

2043
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:27.500
Cherish it, my boy,

2044
01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:32.300
and noble offices thou maysteffect of mediation,

2045
01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:33.900
after I am dead,

2046
01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:38.470
between his greatness and thyother brethren.

2047
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:41.030
Therefore omit him not.

2048
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:46.070
Blunt not his love, nor lose thegood advantage of His Grace

2049
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:50.500
by seeming cold or careless ofhis will,

2050
01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:54.900
for he is gracious, if he beobserved.

2051
01:41:56.770 --> 01:41:59.900
He hath a tear for pity

2052
01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:05.300
and a hand open as day formelting charity.

2053
01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:09.170
Yet notwithstanding, beingincensed, he's flint,

2054
01:42:09.170 --> 01:42:12.300
as humorous as winter

2055
01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:16.470
and as sudden as flaws congealedin the spring of day.

2056
01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:21.700
His temper, therefore, must bewell observed.

2057
01:42:23.630 --> 01:42:27.830
Chide him for faults, and do itreverently,

2058
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:30.800
when you perceive his bloodinclined to mirth.

2059
01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:37.770
But, being moody, give him lineand scope,

2060
01:42:37.770 --> 01:42:43.570
till that his passions, like awhale on ground,

2061
01:42:43.570 --> 01:42:47.500
confound themselves withworking.

2062
01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:50.000
Learn this, Thomas,

2063
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.070
and thou shalt prove a shelterto thy friends,

2064
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:59.770
a hoop of gold to bind thybrothers in,

2065
01:42:59.770 --> 01:43:03.270
that the united vessel of theirblood,

2066
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:06.470
mingled with venom ofsuggestionó

2067
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:10.300
As, force perforce, the age willpour it inó

2068
01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:15.030
shall never leak, though it dowork as strong

2069
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:18.370
as aconitum or more rashgunpowder.

2070
01:43:18.370 --> 01:43:21.300
I shall observe him with allcare and love.

2071
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:26.870
Why art thou not at Windsor withhim, Thomas?

2072
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:32.630
He is not there today.

2073
01:43:32.630 --> 01:43:33.730
He dines in London.

2074
01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:40.700
And how accompanied?

2075
01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:42.170
Canst thou tell that?

2076
01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.000
With Poins and other hiscontinual followers.

2077
01:43:50.770 --> 01:43:56.670
Most subject is the fattest soilto weeds.

2078
01:43:56.670 --> 01:44:01.030
And he, the noble image of myyouth, is overspread with them.

2079
01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:07.070
Therefore my grief stretchesitself beyond the hour of death.

2080
01:44:10.730 --> 01:44:15.070
The blood weeps from my heartwhen I do shape

2081
01:44:15.070 --> 01:44:19.670
in forms imaginary the unguideddays

2082
01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:23.100
and rotten times that you shalllook upon

2083
01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:26.700
when I am sleeping with myancestors.

2084
01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:29.970
For when his headstrong riothath no curb,

2085
01:44:29.970 --> 01:44:34.330
when rage and hot blood are hiscounselors,

2086
01:44:34.330 --> 01:44:38.230
when means and lavish mannersmeet together,

2087
01:44:38.230 --> 01:44:42.130
oh, with what wings shall hisaffections fly

2088
01:44:42.130 --> 01:44:45.730
to fronting peril and opposeddecay.

2089
01:44:45.730 --> 01:44:48.970
My gracious lord, you lookbeyond him quite.

2090
01:44:48.970 --> 01:44:51.570
The prince but studies hiscompanions

2091
01:44:51.570 --> 01:44:54.000
like a strange tongue, wherein,to learn the language.

2092
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.630
'Tis necessary that the mostimmodest words

2093
01:44:56.630 --> 01:44:58.530
be looked upon and learnt,

2094
01:44:58.530 --> 01:45:00.570
which once attained, YourHighness knows,

2095
01:45:00.570 --> 01:45:04.600
comes to no further use but tobe known and hated.

2096
01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:07.870
So like gross terms, the princewill in the perfectness of time

2097
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:10.000
cast off his followers.

2098
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000
And their memory shall as apattern or a measure live,

2099
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.170
by which His Grace must mete thelives of others,

2100
01:45:15.170 --> 01:45:19.130
turning past evils toadvantages.

2101
01:45:19.130 --> 01:45:22.500
'Tis seldom when the bee dothleave her comb

2102
01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:23.630
in the dead carrion.

2103
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:27.930
Who's here?

2104
01:45:27.930 --> 01:45:28.970
Westmoreland?

2105
01:45:30.130 --> 01:45:32.930
Health to my sovereign,

2106
01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:36.370
and new happiness added to thatthat I am to deliver.

2107
01:45:38.130 --> 01:45:40.970
Prince John your son doth kissYour Grace's hand.

2108
01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:46.730
Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop,Hastings, and all

2109
01:45:46.730 --> 01:45:50.230
are brought to the correction ofyour law.

2110
01:45:50.230 --> 01:45:54.800
There is not now a rebel's swordunsheathed,

2111
01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:58.630
but peace puts forth her oliveeverywhere.

2112
01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:05.100
Oh, Westmoreland, thou art asummer bird,

2113
01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:07.500
which ever in the haunch ofwinter sings

2114
01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:09.100
the lifting up of day.

2115
01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:10.770
And there's more news.

2116
01:46:10.770 --> 01:46:12.800
The earl Northumberland and thelord Bardolph,

2117
01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:15.430
with a great power of Englishand of Scots,

2118
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:19.130
are by the shrieve of Yorkshireoverthrown.

2119
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:33.330
And wherefore should these goodnews make me sick?

2120
01:46:33.330 --> 01:46:37.930
Will fortune never come withboth hands full,

2121
01:46:37.930 --> 01:46:44.570
but write her fair words stillin foulest letters?

2122
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:49.000
She either gives a stomach andno food.

2123
01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.830
Such are the poor in health.

2124
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:58.130
Or else a feast and takes awaythe stomach.

2125
01:46:58.130 --> 01:47:02.430
Such are the rich that haveabundance and enjoy it not.

2126
01:47:04.930 --> 01:47:09.170
I should rejoice now at thishappy news.

2127
01:47:09.170 --> 01:47:15.000
And now my sight fails and mybrain is giddy.

2128
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Oh, me.

2129
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Come near me.

2130
01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.030
Now I am much ill.

2131
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:20.300
Comfort, Your Majesty.

2132
01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:21.430
Oh, my royal father.

2133
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:22.570
My sovereign lord, cheer upyourself,

2134
01:47:22.570 --> 01:47:23.230
Look up.

2135
01:47:23.230 --> 01:47:24.670
Be patient, princes.

2136
01:47:24.670 --> 01:47:26.400
You do know, these fits are withHis Highness very ordinary.

2137
01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:27.400
Stand from him.

2138
01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:28.530
Give him air.

2139
01:47:28.530 --> 01:47:29.600
He'll straight be well.

2140
01:47:38.130 --> 01:47:41.630
No, no, he cannot long hold outthese pangs.

2141
01:47:41.630 --> 01:47:43.630
The incessant care and labor ofhis mind

2142
01:47:43.630 --> 01:47:45.430
hath wrought the mure thatshould confine it in

2143
01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:49.700
so thin that life looks throughand will break out.

2144
01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:52.800
This apoplexy will certain behis end.

2145
01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:54.500
Softly, pray.

2146
01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:05.430
Who saw the duke of Clarence?

2147
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:08.400
I am here, brother, full ofheaviness.

2148
01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:09.400
How now.

2149
01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:11.030
Rain within doors and noneabroad.

2150
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:15.800
How doth the king?

2151
01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:17.400
Exceeding ill.

2152
01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:20.500
Heard he the good news yet?

2153
01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:21.500
Tell it him.

2154
01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:23.530
He altered much upon the hearingit.

2155
01:48:23.530 --> 01:48:25.400
If he be sick with joy, he'llrecover without physic.

2156
01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:27.430
Not so much noise, my lords.

2157
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:28.630
Sweet prince, speak low.

2158
01:48:28.630 --> 01:48:31.970
The king your father is disposedto sleep.

2159
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:33.430
Let us withdraw into the otherroom.

2160
01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:46.170
Please it Your Grace to go alongwith us?

2161
01:48:46.170 --> 01:48:49.970
No, I will sit and watch here bythe king.

2162
01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:20.570
Why doth the crown lie thereupon his pillow,

2163
01:49:20.570 --> 01:49:24.130
being so troublesome abedfellow?

2164
01:49:24.130 --> 01:49:27.000
Oh, polished perturbation.

2165
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.430
Golden care.

2166
01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:31.130
It keeps the ports of slumberopen wide

2167
01:49:31.130 --> 01:49:32.900
to many a watchful night.

2168
01:49:36.930 --> 01:49:41.100
Sleep with it nowó

2169
01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:43.500
yet not so sound and half sodeeply sweet

2170
01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:46.300
as he whose brow with homelybiggen bound

2171
01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:47.930
snores out the watch of night.

2172
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:54.770
Oh, majesty,

2173
01:49:54.770 --> 01:49:57.900
when thou dost pinch thy bearer,

2174
01:49:57.900 --> 01:50:02.370
thou dost sit like a rich armorworn in heat of day

2175
01:50:02.370 --> 01:50:04.270
that scalds with safety.

2176
01:50:10.130 --> 01:50:11.230
By his gates of breath

2177
01:50:11.230 --> 01:50:15.230
there lies a downy feather whichstirs not.

2178
01:50:15.230 --> 01:50:16.570
Did he suspire,

2179
01:50:16.570 --> 01:50:18.870
that light and weightless downperforce must move.

2180
01:50:21.930 --> 01:50:23.270
My gracious lord?

2181
01:50:28.170 --> 01:50:29.330
My father?

2182
01:50:34.030 --> 01:50:38.200
This sleep is sound indeed.

2183
01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:40.330
This is a sleep that from thisgolden rigol

2184
01:50:40.330 --> 01:50:42.270
hath divorced so many Englishkings.

2185
01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:56.730
Thy due from me is tears andheavy sorrows of the blood,

2186
01:50:56.730 --> 01:51:04.830
which nature, love, and filialtenderness,

2187
01:51:04.830 --> 01:51:13.570
shall, oh, dear Father, pay theeplenteously.

2188
01:51:17.730 --> 01:51:20.630
My due from thee is thisimperial crown,

2189
01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:29.900
which, as immediate as thy placeand blood,

2190
01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:31.970
derives itself to me.

2191
01:51:37.570 --> 01:51:41.400
Lo, where it sits, which Godshall guard.

2192
01:52:09.130 --> 01:52:14.970
And put the world's wholestrength into one giant arm,

2193
01:52:14.970 --> 01:52:18.000
it shall not force this linealhonor from me.

2194
01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:28.070
This from thee will I to mineleave, as 'tis left to me.

2195
01:52:53.230 --> 01:52:55.000
Warwick.

2196
01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.370
Gloucester and Clarence.

2197
01:52:56.370 --> 01:52:57.530
Doth the king call?

2198
01:52:57.530 --> 01:52:58.930
What would Your Majesty?

2199
01:52:58.930 --> 01:52:59.930
How fares my lord?

2200
01:53:05.470 --> 01:53:07.600
Why did you leave me here alone,my lords?

2201
01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:09.730
We left the prince my brotherhere, my liege,

2202
01:53:09.730 --> 01:53:11.770
who undertook to sit and watchby you.

2203
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:14.430
The Prince of Wales?

2204
01:53:17.530 --> 01:53:18.970
Where is he?

2205
01:53:18.970 --> 01:53:19.970
Find him.

2206
01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:20.970
He is not here.

2207
01:53:20.970 --> 01:53:22.370
The door is open.

2208
01:53:22.370 --> 01:53:24.800
He is gone this way.

2209
01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:26.930
He came not through the chamberwhere we stayed.

2210
01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:33.430
Where is the crown?

2211
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:35.030
Who took it from my pillow?

2212
01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:38.470
When we withdrew, my lord, weleft it there.

2213
01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:43.370
The prince hath ta'en it hence.

2214
01:53:43.370 --> 01:53:46.170
Go seek him out.

2215
01:53:46.170 --> 01:53:51.130
Is he so hasty that he dothsuppose my sleep my death?

2216
01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:54.030
Find him, my lord of Warwick.

2217
01:53:54.030 --> 01:53:55.500
Chide him hither.

2218
01:53:59.730 --> 01:54:03.230
This part of his conjoins withmy disease

2219
01:54:03.230 --> 01:54:04.670
and helps to end me.

2220
01:54:06.430 --> 01:54:09.770
See, sons, what things you are.

2221
01:54:11.770 --> 01:54:14.830
How quickly nature falls intorevolt

2222
01:54:14.830 --> 01:54:18.470
when gold becomes her object.

2223
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:24.300
For this the foolish,overcareful fathers

2224
01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:27.270
have broke their sleep withthoughts,

2225
01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:31.970
their brains with care, theirbones with industry.

2226
01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:34.600
For this they have beenthoughtful to invest

2227
01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:38.530
their sons with arts and martialexercises.

2228
01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:41.930
When, like the bee,

2229
01:54:41.930 --> 01:54:45.500
culling from every flower thevirtuous sweets,

2230
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:51.200
our thighs with wax, our mouthswith honey packed,

2231
01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:55.400
we bring it to the hive, and,like the bees,

2232
01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:59.030
are murdered for our pains.

2233
01:54:59.030 --> 01:55:01.230
This bitter taste.

2234
01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.270
But wherefore did he take awaythe crown?

2235
01:55:11.730 --> 01:55:13.430
Lo, where he comes.

2236
01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:17.800
Come hither to me, Harry.

2237
01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:21.200
Depart the chamber.

2238
01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:22.230
Leave us here alone.

2239
01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:36.770
I never thought to hear youspeak again.

2240
01:55:38.130 --> 01:55:43.470
Thy wish was father, Harry, tothat thought.

2241
01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:48.200
I stay too long by thee.

2242
01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:51.600
I weary thee.

2243
01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:55.970
Dost thou so hunger for mineempty chair

2244
01:55:55.970 --> 01:56:00.470
that thou wilt needs invest theewith my honors

2245
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:02.470
before thy hour be ripe?

2246
01:56:05.130 --> 01:56:08.400
Oh, foolish youth.

2247
01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:13.530
Thou seek'st the greatness thatwill overwhelm thee.

2248
01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:20.400
Stay but a little, for my cloudof dignity

2249
01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:23.670
is held from falling with soweak a wind

2250
01:56:23.670 --> 01:56:27.300
that it will quickly drop.

2251
01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:31.130
My day is dim.

2252
01:56:31.130 --> 01:56:37.030
Thou hast stolen that whichafter some few hours

2253
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:41.270
were thine without offence.

2254
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:45.970
And at my death thou hast sealedup my expectation.

2255
01:56:45.970 --> 01:56:49.800
Thy life did manifest thoulovedst me not,

2256
01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:53.570
and thou wilt have me dieassured of it.

2257
01:56:55.770 --> 01:57:01.700
What canst thou not forbear mehalf an hour?

2258
01:57:01.700 --> 01:57:07.430
Then get thee gone and dig mygrave thyself,

2259
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:11.630
and bid the merry bells ring tothine ear

2260
01:57:11.630 --> 01:57:15.500
that thou art crowned, not thatI am dead.

2261
01:57:17.070 --> 01:57:20.270
Let all the tears that shouldbedew my hearse

2262
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:24.670
be drops of balm to sanctify thyhead.

2263
01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:30.430
Only compound me with forgottendust.

2264
01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:36.670
Give that which gave thee lifeunto the worms.

2265
01:57:36.670 --> 01:57:41.530
Pluck down my officers, break mydecrees,

2266
01:57:41.530 --> 01:57:44.970
for now a time is come to mockat form.

2267
01:57:46.630 --> 01:57:50.370
Harry V is crowned

2268
01:57:52.870 --> 01:57:54.730
Up, vanity.

2269
01:57:54.730 --> 01:57:57.470
Down, royal state.

2270
01:57:57.470 --> 01:58:01.130
All you sage counselors, hence.

2271
01:58:01.130 --> 01:58:04.000
And to the English courtassemble now,

2272
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:09.130
from every region, apes ofidleness.

2273
01:58:09.130 --> 01:58:11.300
For the fifth Harry

2274
01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:15.230
from curbed license plucks themuzzle of restraint,

2275
01:58:15.230 --> 01:58:20.200
and the wild dog shall flesh histooth on every innocent.

2276
01:58:23.330 --> 01:58:29.230
Oh, my poor kingdom, sick withcivil blows.

2277
01:58:29.230 --> 01:58:32.830
When that my care could notwithhold thy riots,

2278
01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:36.230
what wilt thou do when riot isthy care?

2279
01:58:37.570 --> 01:58:40.530
Oh, thou wilt be a wildernessagain,

2280
01:58:40.530 --> 01:58:43.830
peopled with wolves, thy oldinhabitants.

2281
01:58:46.630 --> 01:58:50.170
Oh, pardon me, my liege.

2282
01:58:50.170 --> 01:58:53.530
But for my tears, the moistimpediments unto my speech,

2283
01:58:53.530 --> 01:58:57.700
I had forestalled this dear anddeep rebuke

2284
01:58:57.700 --> 01:58:59.130
ere you with grief had spoke

2285
01:58:59.130 --> 01:59:01.630
and I had heard the course of itso far.

2286
01:59:03.570 --> 01:59:05.270
There is your crown,

2287
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:08.400
and he that wears the crownimmortally long guard it yours.

2288
01:59:10.530 --> 01:59:17.870
If I affect it more than as yourhonor and as your renown,

2289
01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:21.570
let me no more from thisobedience rise,

2290
01:59:21.570 --> 01:59:26.670
which my most inward, true, andduteous spirit teacheth,

2291
01:59:26.670 --> 01:59:29.000
this prostrate and exteriorbending.

2292
01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:34.700
God witness with me, when I herecame in

2293
01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:36.800
and found no course of breathwithin Your Majesty,

2294
01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:38.670
how cold it struck my heart.

2295
01:59:40.900 --> 01:59:44.430
If I do feign, oh, let me in mypresent wildness die

2296
01:59:44.430 --> 01:59:46.570
and never live to show theincredulous world

2297
01:59:46.570 --> 01:59:48.800
the noble change that I havepurposed.

2298
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:54.730
Coming to look on you, thinkingyou dead,

2299
01:59:54.730 --> 01:59:57.630
and dead almost, my liege, tothink you were,

2300
01:59:57.630 --> 02:00:00.400
I spake unto this crown ashaving sense

2301
02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:03.730
and thus upbraided it.

2302
02:00:07.130 --> 02:00:11.500
"The care on thee depending hathfed upon the body of my father.

2303
02:00:12.770 --> 02:00:16.970
"Therefore, thou best of goldart worst of gold.

2304
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:20.730
"Other, less fine in carat, ismore precious,

2305
02:00:20.730 --> 02:00:24.100
"preserving life in medicinepotable.

2306
02:00:24.100 --> 02:00:29.470
"But thou, most fine, mosthonored, most renowned,

2307
02:00:29.470 --> 02:00:31.530
hast eat thy bearer up."

2308
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.170
Thus, my most royal liege,accusing it,

2309
02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:41.600
I put it on my head,

2310
02:00:43.630 --> 02:00:46.370
to try with it as with an enemy

2311
02:00:46.370 --> 02:00:49.600
that had before my face murderedmy father.

2312
02:00:52.500 --> 02:00:54.270
The quarrel of a true inheritor.

2313
02:00:56.530 --> 02:00:59.900
But if it did infect my bloodwith joy

2314
02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:03.700
or swell my thoughts to anystrain of pride,

2315
02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:06.130
if any rebel or vain spirit ofmine

2316
02:01:06.130 --> 02:01:07.800
did with the least affection ofa welcome

2317
02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:10.530
give entertainment to the mightof it,

2318
02:01:10.530 --> 02:01:13.230
let God forever keep it from myhead

2319
02:01:13.230 --> 02:01:15.500
make me as the poorest vassal is

2320
02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:18.330
that doth with awe and terrorkneel to it.

2321
02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.800
Oh, my son,

2322
02:01:27.330 --> 02:01:32.900
God put it in thy mind to takeit hence

2323
02:01:32.900 --> 02:01:37.230
that thou mightst win the morethy father's love,

2324
02:01:37.230 --> 02:01:40.770
pleading so wisely in excuse ofit.

2325
02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:48.530
Come hither, Harry.

2326
02:01:50.070 --> 02:01:57.430
Sit thou by my bed and hear, Ithink, the very latest counsel

2327
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:58.770
that ever I shall breathe.

2328
02:02:05.100 --> 02:02:07.500
God knows, my son,

2329
02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:15.400
by what bypaths and indirect,crooked ways I met this crown;

2330
02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:21.170
and I myself know well howtroublesome it sat upon my head.

2331
02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:27.730
To thee it shall descend withbetter quiet,

2332
02:02:27.730 --> 02:02:31.670
better opinion, betterconfirmation,

2333
02:02:31.670 --> 02:02:34.300
for all the soil of theachievement

2334
02:02:34.300 --> 02:02:36.800
goes with me into the earth.

2335
02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:46.770
It seemed in me but as an honorsnatched with boisterous hand,

2336
02:02:46.770 --> 02:02:48.330
and I had many living

2337
02:02:48.330 --> 02:02:52.570
to upbraid my gain of it bytheir assistances,

2338
02:02:52.570 --> 02:02:55.570
which daily grew to quarrel andto bloodshed,

2339
02:02:55.570 --> 02:02:57.570
wounding supposed peace.

2340
02:02:59.570 --> 02:03:06.370
All these bold fears thou see'stwith peril I have answered,

2341
02:03:06.370 --> 02:03:11.130
for all my reign hath been butas a scene acting that argument.

2342
02:03:13.170 --> 02:03:16.400
And now my death changes themood.

2343
02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:22.170
For what in me was purchased

2344
02:03:22.170 --> 02:03:26.470
falls upon thee in a more fairersort,

2345
02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:29.870
so thou the garland wear'stsuccessively.

2346
02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:36.300
Yet, though thou stand'st moresure than I could do,

2347
02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:40.730
thou art not firm enough, sincegriefs are green.

2348
02:03:40.730 --> 02:03:44.600
And all my friends, which thoumust make thy friends,

2349
02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:47.500
have but their stings and teethnewly ta'en out,

2350
02:03:48.930 --> 02:03:52.270
by whose fell working I wasfirst advanced

2351
02:03:52.270 --> 02:03:56.830
and by whose power I well mightlodge a fear

2352
02:03:56.830 --> 02:03:58.270
to be again displaced,

2353
02:04:00.930 --> 02:04:04.830
which to avoid, I cut them off,

2354
02:04:04.830 --> 02:04:09.800
and had a purpose now to leadout many to the Holy Land,

2355
02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:13.670
lest rest and lying still mightmake them look

2356
02:04:13.670 --> 02:04:15.670
too near unto my state.

2357
02:04:17.230 --> 02:04:24.400
Therefore, my Harry, be it thycourse to busy giddy minds

2358
02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:26.700
with foreign quarrels.

2359
02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:29.300
That action, hence borne out,

2360
02:04:29.300 --> 02:04:32.300
may waste the memory of theformer days.

2361
02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:50.930
More would I, but my lungs arewasted

2362
02:04:50.930 --> 02:04:56.900
so that strength of speech isutterly denied me.

2363
02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:07.900
How I came by the crown, oh, Godforgive;

2364
02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:14.330
and grant it may with thee intrue peace live.

2365
02:05:16.370 --> 02:05:18.300
My gracious liege,

2366
02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:27.600
you won it, wore it, kept it,gave it me.

2367
02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:31.700
Then plain and right must mypossession be,

2368
02:05:31.700 --> 02:05:35.400
which I with more than with acommon pain

2369
02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:39.730
'gainst all the world willrightfully maintain.

2370
02:05:46.170 --> 02:05:48.730
Doth any name particular

2371
02:05:48.730 --> 02:05:52.770
belong unto the lodging where Ifirst did swoon?

2372
02:05:52.770 --> 02:05:55.130
'Tis called Jerusalem, my noblelord.

2373
02:05:59.230 --> 02:06:00.530
Laud be to God.

2374
02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:04.770
Even there my life must end.

2375
02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:10.500
It hath been prophesied to memany years,

2376
02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:13.770
I should not die but inJerusalem,

2377
02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:19.730
which vainly I supposed the HolyLand.

2378
02:06:22.170 --> 02:06:23.830
But bear me to that chamber.

2379
02:06:25.770 --> 02:06:26.930
There I'll lie.

2380
02:06:29.330 --> 02:06:34.230
In that Jerusalem shall Harrydie.

2381
02:06:40.330 --> 02:06:44.230
By cock and pie, sir, you shallnot away tonight.

2382
02:06:44.230 --> 02:06:46.400
What, Davy, I say.

2383
02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:48.930
You must excuse me, MasterRobert Shallow.

2384
02:06:48.930 --> 02:06:52.000
I will not excuse you; you shallnot be excused.

2385
02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.800
Excuses shall not be admitted.

2386
02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:55.630
There is no excuse shall serve.

2387
02:06:55.630 --> 02:06:57.300
You shall not be excused.

2388
02:06:57.300 --> 02:06:58.300
Why, Davy, Ió

2389
02:06:58.300 --> 02:06:59.770
Here, sir.

2390
02:06:59.770 --> 02:07:02.870
Davy, Davy, Davy,let me see,Davy.

2391
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:04.030
Let me see.

2392
02:07:04.030 --> 02:07:07.070
Ah, marry, William cook, bid himcome hither.

2393
02:07:07.070 --> 02:07:09.430
Sir John, you shall not beexcused.

2394
02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:11.000
Marry, sir, thus,

2395
02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.400
those precepts cannot be served,and, again, sir,

2396
02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:16.800
shall we sow the headland withwheat?

2397
02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:18.370
With red wheat, Davy.

2398
02:07:18.370 --> 02:07:21.270
But for William cook, have we noyoung pigeons?

2399
02:07:21.270 --> 02:07:23.100
Yes, sir.

2400
02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:26.470
Sir, here is now the smith'snote

2401
02:07:26.470 --> 02:07:28.030
for shoeing and plough irons.

2402
02:07:28.030 --> 02:07:30.270
Well, let it be cast and paid.

2403
02:07:30.270 --> 02:07:33.070
Sir John, you shall not beexcused.

2404
02:07:33.070 --> 02:07:36.730
Now, sir, a new link to thebucket must needs be had.

2405
02:07:36.730 --> 02:07:40.430
And, sir, do you mean to stopany of William's wages

2406
02:07:40.430 --> 02:07:43.900
about the sack he lost the otherday at Hinckley fair?

2407
02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:45.470
A' shall answer it.

2408
02:07:45.470 --> 02:07:51.430
Let him cook some pigeons, Davy,a couple of short-legged hens,

2409
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:54.470
some  joint of mutton,

2410
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:57.500
and some, any pretty, little,tiny kickshaws;

2411
02:07:57.500 --> 02:07:59.030
tell William cook.

2412
02:07:59.030 --> 02:08:01.800
Doth the man of war stay allnight, sir?

2413
02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:03.800
Yea, I will use him well, Davy.

2414
02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:06.670
A friend at court is better thana penny in purse.

2415
02:08:06.670 --> 02:08:08.870
And for his men, use them well,

2416
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:12.200
for they are arrant knaves andwill backbite.

2417
02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:13.970
No worse than they arebackbitten,

2418
02:08:13.970 --> 02:08:16.670
for they have marvelous foullinen.

2419
02:08:16.670 --> 02:08:18.500
Well conceited, Davy.

2420
02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:20.430
About thy business, Davy.

2421
02:08:20.430 --> 02:08:21.430
Where are you, Sir John?

2422
02:08:21.430 --> 02:08:22.430
Come, come, come.

2423
02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:24.370
Off with your boots.

2424
02:08:24.370 --> 02:08:26.170
Give me your hand, good MasterBardolph.

2425
02:08:26.170 --> 02:08:27.930
By Your Worship.

2426
02:08:27.930 --> 02:08:29.600
I thank thee from my heart.

2427
02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:31.300
And welcome, my tall fellow.

2428
02:08:31.300 --> 02:08:32.870
Come, Sir John.

2429
02:08:32.870 --> 02:08:35.100
Come, Sir John.

2430
02:08:35.100 --> 02:08:37.700
I'll follow you, Master RobertShallow.

2431
02:08:37.700 --> 02:08:38.700
Bardolph.

2432
02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:39.700
What?

2433
02:08:39.700 --> 02:08:40.730
Look to our horses.

2434
02:08:43.630 --> 02:08:48.400
If I were sawed into quantities,

2435
02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:51.200
I should make four dozen of suchbearded hermits' staves

2436
02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:52.230
as Master Shallow.

2437
02:08:54.630 --> 02:08:58.130
It's a wonderful thing to seethe semblable coherence

2438
02:08:58.130 --> 02:09:01.070
of his men's spirits and his.

2439
02:09:01.070 --> 02:09:02.800
They, by observing of him,

2440
02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:05.770
do bear themselves like foolishjustices.

2441
02:09:05.770 --> 02:09:07.170
He, by conversing with them,

2442
02:09:07.170 --> 02:09:10.800
is turned into a justice-likeservingman.

2443
02:09:11.900 --> 02:09:13.600
It's certain that either wisebearing

2444
02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:15.470
or ignorant carriage is caught,

2445
02:09:15.470 --> 02:09:17.900
as men take diseases, one ofanother.

2446
02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:20.670
Therefore let men take heed ofthe company they keep.

2447
02:09:24.730 --> 02:09:30.200
I will devise matter enough outof this Shallow

2448
02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:33.930
to keep Prince Harry incontinual laughter.

2449
02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:40.900
Oh, you shall see him laugh

2450
02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:44.130
till his face be likea wet cloakill laid up.

2451
02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:47.130
Sir John.

2452
02:09:47.130 --> 02:09:48.970
Sir John.

2453
02:09:48.970 --> 02:09:51.700
I come, Master Shallow.

2454
02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:56.500
I come, Master Shallow.

2455
02:10:05.830 --> 02:10:07.670
How doth the king?

2456
02:10:07.670 --> 02:10:09.270
Excellent well.

2457
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:11.500
His cares are now all ended.

2458
02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:14.330
I hope, not dead.

2459
02:10:14.330 --> 02:10:16.770
He's walked the way of nature.

2460
02:10:16.770 --> 02:10:18.730
To our purposes, he lives nomore.

2461
02:10:18.730 --> 02:10:20.770
I would His Majesty had calledme with him.

2462
02:10:20.770 --> 02:10:22.830
The service that I truly did hislife

2463
02:10:22.830 --> 02:10:25.770
hath left me open to allinjuries.

2464
02:10:25.770 --> 02:10:28.870
Indeed, I think the young kingloves you not.

2465
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:30.230
I know he doth not

2466
02:10:30.230 --> 02:10:33.170
and do arm myself to welcome thecondition of the time,

2467
02:10:33.170 --> 02:10:35.200
which cannot look more hideouslyupon me

2468
02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:37.670
than I have drawn it in myfantasy.

2469
02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:45.370
Here come the heavy issue ofdead Harry.

2470
02:10:45.370 --> 02:10:46.670
Oh, that the living Harry

2471
02:10:46.670 --> 02:10:49.900
had the temper of either worstof these three gentlemen.

2472
02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:52.170
How many nobles then might keeptheir place

2473
02:10:52.170 --> 02:10:55.070
that must strike sail to spiritsof vile sort.

2474
02:10:59.170 --> 02:11:02.430
Oh, God, I fear all will beoverthrown.

2475
02:11:11.930 --> 02:11:15.270
Good morrow, and God save YourMajesty.

2476
02:11:28.570 --> 02:11:31.670
This new and gorgeous garment,majesty,

2477
02:11:31.670 --> 02:11:33.800
sits not so easy on me as youthink.

2478
02:11:36.570 --> 02:11:40.470
Brothers, you mix your sadnesswith some fear.

2479
02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:44.870
This is the English, not theTurkish court.

2480
02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:48.230
Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,but Harry Harry.

2481
02:11:50.070 --> 02:11:51.300
Yet be sad, good brothers,

2482
02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:53.730
for, by my faith, it very wellbecomes you.

2483
02:11:53.730 --> 02:11:56.030
Sorrow so royally in you appears

2484
02:11:56.030 --> 02:11:57.570
that I will deeply put thefashion on

2485
02:11:57.570 --> 02:11:58.730
and wear it in my heart.

2486
02:12:00.370 --> 02:12:01.530
Why then, be sad.

2487
02:12:01.530 --> 02:12:04.170
But entertain no more of it,good brothers,

2488
02:12:04.170 --> 02:12:07.200
than a joint burden laid upon usall.

2489
02:12:09.100 --> 02:12:13.870
For me, by heaven, I bid you beassured,

2490
02:12:13.870 --> 02:12:16.930
I'll be your father and yourbrother too.

2491
02:12:16.930 --> 02:12:20.400
Let me but bear your love, andI'll bear your cares.

2492
02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:26.070
Yet weep that Harry's dead, andso will I.

2493
02:12:26.070 --> 02:12:28.730
But Harry lives that shallconvert those tears

2494
02:12:28.730 --> 02:12:31.200
by number into hours ofhappiness.

2495
02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:35.570
We hope no otherwise from YourMajesty.

2496
02:12:42.930 --> 02:12:46.200
You all look strangely on me,

2497
02:12:47.930 --> 02:12:50.500
and you most.

2498
02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:52.270
You are, I think, assured I loveyou not.

2499
02:12:53.570 --> 02:12:56.230
I am assured, if I be rightlymeasured,

2500
02:12:56.230 --> 02:12:59.570
Your Majesty hath no just causeto hate me.

2501
02:12:59.570 --> 02:13:01.370
No?

2502
02:13:01.370 --> 02:13:02.800
How might a prince of my greathopes

2503
02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:05.700
forget so great indignities youlaid upon me?

2504
02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:07.130
What?

2505
02:13:07.130 --> 02:13:10.930
Rate, rebuke, and roughly sendto prison

2506
02:13:10.930 --> 02:13:12.770
the immediate heir of England.

2507
02:13:12.770 --> 02:13:14.570
Was this easy?

2508
02:13:14.570 --> 02:13:16.630
May this be washed in lethe andforgotten?

2509
02:13:16.630 --> 02:13:20.230
I then did use the person ofyour fatheró

2510
02:13:20.230 --> 02:13:23.530
the image of his power lay thenin meó

2511
02:13:23.530 --> 02:13:26.100
and, in the administration ofhis law,

2512
02:13:26.100 --> 02:13:27.900
whiles I was busy for thecommonwealth,

2513
02:13:27.900 --> 02:13:30.530
Your Highness pleased to forgetmy place,

2514
02:13:30.530 --> 02:13:33.270
the majesty and power of law andjustice,

2515
02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:35.970
the image of the king whom Ipresented,

2516
02:13:35.970 --> 02:13:39.970
and struck me in my very seat ofjudgment,

2517
02:13:39.970 --> 02:13:43.530
whereon, as an offender to yourfather,

2518
02:13:43.530 --> 02:13:46.530
I gave bold way to my authorityand did commit you.

2519
02:13:46.530 --> 02:13:48.770
If this were ill done,

2520
02:13:48.770 --> 02:13:50.970
be you contented wearing now thegarland,

2521
02:13:50.970 --> 02:13:53.970
to have a son set your decreesat naught,

2522
02:13:53.970 --> 02:13:57.100
to pluck down justice from yourawful bench,

2523
02:13:57.100 --> 02:13:59.670
to trip the course of law andblunt the sword

2524
02:13:59.670 --> 02:14:02.900
that guards the peace and safetyof your person.

2525
02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:06.300
Behold yourself so by a sondisdained,

2526
02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:09.370
and then imagine me taking yourpart

2527
02:14:09.370 --> 02:14:13.570
and in your power soft silencingyour son.

2528
02:14:17.770 --> 02:14:21.570
After this cold considerance,sentence me.

2529
02:14:21.570 --> 02:14:22.700
And, as you are a king,

2530
02:14:22.700 --> 02:14:24.830
speak in your state what I havedone

2531
02:14:24.830 --> 02:14:27.230
that misbecame my place, myperson,

2532
02:14:27.230 --> 02:14:29.970
or my liege's sovereignty.

2533
02:14:35.330 --> 02:14:37.230
You are right, Justice,

2534
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:42.470
and you weigh this well.

2535
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:44.970
Therefore still bear the balanceand the sword.

2536
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:48.100
And I do wish your honors mayincrease

2537
02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:49.630
till you do live to see a son ofmine

2538
02:14:49.630 --> 02:14:53.600
offend you and obey you, as Idid.

2539
02:14:56.300 --> 02:14:58.470
So shall I live to speak myfather's words.

2540
02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:03.030
"Happy am I that have a man sobold

2541
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:07.230
"that dares do justice on myproper son,

2542
02:15:07.230 --> 02:15:09.670
"and not less happy, having sucha son,

2543
02:15:09.670 --> 02:15:11.330
"that would deliver up hisgreatness

2544
02:15:11.330 --> 02:15:13.000
so into the hands of justice."

2545
02:15:18.170 --> 02:15:20.770
You did commit me,

2546
02:15:20.770 --> 02:15:25.230
for which, I do commit into yourhand the unstained sword

2547
02:15:25.230 --> 02:15:29.500
that you have used to bear, withthis remembrance:

2548
02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:30.730
that you use the same

2549
02:15:30.730 --> 02:15:33.300
with the like bold, just, andimpartial spirit

2550
02:15:33.300 --> 02:15:36.530
that you have used 'gainst me.

2551
02:15:36.530 --> 02:15:37.700
There is my hand.

2552
02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:43.270
You shall be as a father to myyouth.

2553
02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:46.300
My voice shall sound as you doprompt mine ear,

2554
02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:48.400
and I will stoop and humble myintents

2555
02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:50.830
to your well-practiced, wisedirections.

2556
02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:58.000
And, princes all, believe me, Ibeseech you.

2557
02:15:59.770 --> 02:16:03.570
My father is gone wild into hisgrave,

2558
02:16:03.570 --> 02:16:05.770
for in his tomb lie myaffections.

2559
02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.630
And with his spirit sadly Isurvive

2560
02:16:09.630 --> 02:16:15.070
to mock the expectation of theworld, to frustrate prophecies,

2561
02:16:15.070 --> 02:16:17.230
and to raze out rotten opinion,

2562
02:16:17.230 --> 02:16:19.530
who hath writ me down after myseeming.

2563
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:23.030
The tide of blood in me

2564
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:27.270
hath proudly flowed in vanitytill now.

2565
02:16:28.670 --> 02:16:30.970
Now doth it turn and ebb back tothe sea,

2566
02:16:30.970 --> 02:16:32.800
where it shall mingle with thestate of floods

2567
02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:35.430
and flow henceforth in formalmajesty.

2568
02:16:41.930 --> 02:16:44.870
Now call we our high court ofparliament.

2569
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:47.630
And let us choose such limbs ofnoble counsel

2570
02:16:47.630 --> 02:16:49.330
that the great body of our statemay go

2571
02:16:49.330 --> 02:16:52.530
in equal rank with the bestgoverned nation,

2572
02:16:52.530 --> 02:16:56.430
that war or peace or both atonce

2573
02:16:56.430 --> 02:17:00.200
may be as things acquainted andfamiliar to us,

2574
02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:03.030
in which you, Father, shall haveforemost hand.

2575
02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:08.400
Our coronation done, we willaccite,

2576
02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:11.670
as I before remembered, all ourstate.

2577
02:17:11.670 --> 02:17:15.970
And, God consigning to my goodintents,

2578
02:17:15.970 --> 02:17:21.730
no prince nor peer shall havejust cause to say,

2579
02:17:21.730 --> 02:17:25.800
"God shorten Harry's happy lifeone day."

2580
02:17:26.530 --> 02:17:28.430
God save the king!

2581
02:17:29.900 --> 02:17:33.270
Sir John, you shall see myorchard,

2582
02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:35.130
where, in an arbor,

2583
02:17:35.130 --> 02:17:38.670
we will eat the last year'spippin of my own grafting

2584
02:17:38.670 --> 02:17:41.770
and a dish of caraways, and soforth.

2585
02:17:41.770 --> 02:17:45.270
Come, cousin Silence, and thento bed.

2586
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:49.330
'Fore God, you have a goodlydwelling here and rich.

2587
02:17:49.330 --> 02:17:51.900
Barren, barren, barren.

2588
02:17:51.900 --> 02:17:55.230
Beggars all; beggars all, SirJohn.

2589
02:17:55.230 --> 02:17:58.200
Marry, good air.

2590
02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:01.670
Well spread, Davy; well spread,Davy.

2591
02:18:01.670 --> 02:18:02.770
Well said, Davy.

2592
02:18:02.770 --> 02:18:04.930
This Davy serves you in gooduses.

2593
02:18:04.930 --> 02:18:07.500
He is your servingman and yourhusband.

2594
02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:10.800
He's a good varlet, a goodvarlet, a good varlet.

2595
02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:13.370
He's a good varlet, Sir John.

2596
02:18:13.370 --> 02:18:19.230
Oh, by the mass, I have drunktoo much sack at supper.

2597
02:18:19.230 --> 02:18:21.870
A good varlet.

2598
02:18:21.870 --> 02:18:22.870
Now sit down.

2599
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:23.870
Come on.

2600
02:18:23.870 --> 02:18:25.330
Now sit down.

2601
02:18:25.330 --> 02:18:27.200
Come, Cousin.

2602
02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:31.230
Ah, sirrah, quotha,

2603
02:18:31.230 --> 02:18:36.100
we shall do nothing but eat andmake good cheer

2604
02:18:36.100 --> 02:18:40.730
and praise God for a merry year,

2605
02:18:40.730 --> 02:18:46.530
when flesh is cheap and femalesdear

2606
02:18:46.530 --> 02:18:50.430
and lusty lads roam here andthere,

2607
02:18:50.430 --> 02:18:53.800
so merrily, so merrily,

2608
02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:58.100
and ever anon so merrily.

2609
02:18:59.500 --> 02:19:01.930
There's a merry heart.

2610
02:19:01.930 --> 02:19:05.530
Good Master Silence, I'll giveyou a health for that anon.

2611
02:19:07.500 --> 02:19:11.970
Davy, give Master Bardolph somewine.

2612
02:19:11.970 --> 02:19:14.530
Sweet sir, sit.

2613
02:19:14.530 --> 02:19:15.700
I'll be with you anon.

2614
02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:17.670
Most sweet sir, sit.

2615
02:19:17.670 --> 02:19:21.330
Master page, good master page,sit.

2616
02:19:21.330 --> 02:19:24.070
And what you want in meat, we'llhave in drink.

2617
02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:25.800
But you must bear.

2618
02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:27.370
The heart's all.

2619
02:19:27.370 --> 02:19:29.300
Master Bardolph, be merry,

2620
02:19:29.300 --> 02:19:33.970
and, my little soldier there, bemerry.

2621
02:19:33.970 --> 02:19:36.730
Be merry; be merry.

2622
02:19:36.730 --> 02:19:39.130
My wife has all.

2623
02:19:39.130 --> 02:19:43.430
Women are shrews, both short andtall.

2624
02:19:43.430 --> 02:19:48.400
'Tis merry in hall when beardslack all

2625
02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:52.030
and welcome merry shrovetide.

2626
02:19:52.030 --> 02:19:56.400
Be merry; be merry.

2627
02:19:58.700 --> 02:20:00.800
I did not think Master Silence

2628
02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:02.730
to have been a man of thismettle.

2629
02:20:04.030 --> 02:20:05.370
An't please your worship,

2630
02:20:05.370 --> 02:20:08.530
there's one Pistol come from thecourt with news.

2631
02:20:08.530 --> 02:20:09.530
From the court?

2632
02:20:09.530 --> 02:20:11.030
Let him come in.

2633
02:20:12.100 --> 02:20:13.800
How now, Pistol.

2634
02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:16.030
Sir John, God save you.

2635
02:20:16.030 --> 02:20:18.730
What wind blew you hither,Pistol?

2636
02:20:18.730 --> 02:20:21.330
Not the ill wind that blows noman to good.

2637
02:20:21.330 --> 02:20:22.570
Sweet knight,

2638
02:20:22.570 --> 02:20:24.930
thou art now one of the greatestmen in this realm.

2639
02:20:24.930 --> 02:20:27.600
Sir John, I am thy Pistol andthy friend.

2640
02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:29.270
And helter-skelter have I rodeto thee,

2641
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:30.530
and tidings do I bring

2642
02:20:30.530 --> 02:20:34.630
and lucky joys and golden timesand happy news of price.

2643
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:36.800
I pray you now, deliver themlike a man of this world.

2644
02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:40.370
A fouter for the world andworldlings base.

2645
02:20:40.370 --> 02:20:44.870
I speak of Africa and goldenjoys.

2646
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:47.800
Oh, base Assyrian knight, whatis thy news?

2647
02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:50.400
Let King Cophetua know the truththereof.

2648
02:20:50.400 --> 02:20:51.930
Give me your pardon, sir.

2649
02:20:51.930 --> 02:20:54.600
If, sir, you come from the courtwith news,

2650
02:20:54.600 --> 02:20:56.430
I take it there's but two ways,

2651
02:20:56.430 --> 02:21:00.330
either to utter them or concealthem.

2652
02:21:00.330 --> 02:21:05.430
I am, sir, under the king, insome authority.

2653
02:21:05.430 --> 02:21:09.130
Under which king, Besonian?

2654
02:21:09.130 --> 02:21:11.370
Speak or die.

2655
02:21:11.370 --> 02:21:13.500
Under King Harry.

2656
02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:16.300
Harry IV or

2657
02:21:16.300 --> 02:21:19.030
Harry IV.

2658
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:21.770
A fouter for thine office.

2659
02:21:21.770 --> 02:21:24.570
Sir John, thy tender lambkin nowis king.

2660
02:21:24.570 --> 02:21:26.430
Harry V's the man.

2661
02:21:26.430 --> 02:21:28.900
If Pistol lie, do this

2662
02:21:28.900 --> 02:21:30.570
and fig me like the braggingSpaniard.

2663
02:21:30.570 --> 02:21:31.630
What?

2664
02:21:31.630 --> 02:21:33.970
Is the old king dead?

2665
02:21:33.970 --> 02:21:37.200
As nail in door.

2666
02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:39.170
The things I speak are just.

2667
02:21:41.170 --> 02:21:42.470
Bardolph.

2668
02:21:42.470 --> 02:21:43.570
Away, Bardolph.

2669
02:21:43.570 --> 02:21:45.270
Saddle my horse.

2670
02:21:45.270 --> 02:21:47.570
Master Robert Shallow,

2671
02:21:47.570 --> 02:21:50.930
choose what office thou wilt inthe land.

2672
02:21:50.930 --> 02:21:52.270
'Tis thine.

2673
02:21:52.270 --> 02:21:56.130
Pistol, I will double chargethee with dignities.

2674
02:21:56.130 --> 02:21:57.630
Oh, joyful day.

2675
02:21:57.630 --> 02:21:59.800
I would not take a knighthoodfor my fortune.

2676
02:21:59.800 --> 02:22:01.430
I do bring good news.

2677
02:22:01.430 --> 02:22:04.630
Master Robert Shallowó my LordShallowó

2678
02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:06.200
be what thou wilt.

2679
02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:07.330
I am fortune's steward.

2680
02:22:07.330 --> 02:22:08.330
But go on.

2681
02:22:08.330 --> 02:22:09.330
Get on thy boots.

2682
02:22:09.330 --> 02:22:10.430
We'll ride all night.

2683
02:22:10.430 --> 02:22:11.970
Oh, sweet Pistol.

2684
02:22:11.970 --> 02:22:13.100
Away, Bardolph.

2685
02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:14.970
Here, boot, boot, MasterShallow.

2686
02:22:14.970 --> 02:22:18.470
I know the young king is sickfor me.

2687
02:22:18.470 --> 02:22:20.570
Oh, let us take any man'shorses.

2688
02:22:20.570 --> 02:22:24.470
The laws of England are at mycommandment.

2689
02:22:24.470 --> 02:22:27.270
Blessed are they that have beenmy friends,

2690
02:22:27.270 --> 02:22:31.730
and woe to my lord chiefjustice.

2691
02:22:31.730 --> 02:22:34.000
Come!

2692
02:22:42.670 --> 02:22:44.730
Stand back!

2693
02:22:44.730 --> 02:22:48.470
Standóstand here by me, MasterRobert Shallow.

2694
02:22:48.470 --> 02:22:51.370
I will make the king do yougrace.

2695
02:22:51.370 --> 02:22:53.530
I will leer upon him as a' comesby.

2696
02:22:53.530 --> 02:22:55.870
And do but mark the countenancehe will give me.

2697
02:22:55.870 --> 02:22:57.700
God bless thy lungs, goodknight.

2698
02:22:57.700 --> 02:22:59.900
Come here, Pistol.

2699
02:22:59.900 --> 02:23:01.300
Stand behind me.

2700
02:23:01.300 --> 02:23:04.200
Oh, I would I'd had time to havemade new liveries.

2701
02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:05.270
I would have bestowed

2702
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:06.570
the thousand pound I borrowed ofyou.

2703
02:23:06.570 --> 02:23:07.800
But 'tis no matter.

2704
02:23:07.800 --> 02:23:10.430
This poor show doth better.

2705
02:23:10.430 --> 02:23:12.200
This doth infer the zeal I hadto see him.

2706
02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:13.300
It doth so.

2707
02:23:13.300 --> 02:23:14.830
It shows my earnestness ofaffection.

2708
02:23:14.830 --> 02:23:15.830
It dothó

2709
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:16.870
My devotionó

2710
02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:17.900
It doth; it doth; it doth.

2711
02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:19.530
As it were, to ride day andnight,

2712
02:23:19.530 --> 02:23:21.400
and not to deliberate, not toremember,

2713
02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:23.270
not to have patience to shiftmeó

2714
02:23:23.270 --> 02:23:24.270
'Tis best, certain.

2715
02:23:24.270 --> 02:23:26.230
But to stand stained with travel

2716
02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:28.470
and sweating with desire to seehim,

2717
02:23:28.470 --> 02:23:29.630
thinking of nothing else,

2718
02:23:29.630 --> 02:23:31.530
putting all affairs else intooblivion,

2719
02:23:31.530 --> 02:23:34.500
as if there were nothing else tobe done but to see him.

2720
02:23:42.030 --> 02:23:44.230
God save Thy Grace, King Hal.

2721
02:23:44.230 --> 02:23:46.830
My royal Hal.

2722
02:23:46.830 --> 02:23:49.570
God save thee, my sweet boy.

2723
02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:56.670
My lord chief justice, speak tothat vain man.

2724
02:23:56.670 --> 02:23:58.400
Have you your wits?

2725
02:23:58.400 --> 02:23:59.900
Know you what 'tis you speak?

2726
02:23:59.900 --> 02:24:00.970
My king.

2727
02:24:00.970 --> 02:24:02.470
My Jove.

2728
02:24:02.470 --> 02:24:04.870
I speak to thee, my heart.

2729
02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:16.770
I know thee not, old man.

2730
02:24:16.770 --> 02:24:18.500
Fall to thy prayers.

2731
02:24:21.630 --> 02:24:24.470
How ill white hairs become afool and jester.

2732
02:24:26.570 --> 02:24:29.830
I have long dreamt of such akind of man,

2733
02:24:29.830 --> 02:24:34.270
so surfeit swelled, so old, andso profane.

2734
02:24:36.730 --> 02:24:39.030
But, being awaked, I do despisemy dream.

2735
02:24:40.270 --> 02:24:45.570
Make less thy body hence andmore thy grace.

2736
02:24:45.570 --> 02:24:47.900
Leave gormandizing.

2737
02:24:47.900 --> 02:24:50.130
Know the grave doth gape forthee

2738
02:24:50.130 --> 02:24:51.670
thrice wider than for other men.

2739
02:24:52.730 --> 02:24:55.930
Reply not to me with a fool bornjest.

2740
02:24:55.930 --> 02:24:58.730
Presume not I am the thing Iwas,

2741
02:24:58.730 --> 02:25:03.600
for God doth know, so shall theworld perceive,

2742
02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:07.500
that I have turned away myformer self.

2743
02:25:07.500 --> 02:25:11.800
So will I those that kept mecompany.

2744
02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:14.070
When thou dost hear I am as Ihave been,

2745
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:17.070
approach me, and thou shalt beas thou wast,

2746
02:25:17.070 --> 02:25:19.730
the tutor and feeder of myriots.

2747
02:25:25.070 --> 02:25:28.230
Till then, I banish thee, onpain of death,

2748
02:25:28.230 --> 02:25:30.100
as I have done the rest of mymisleaders,

2749
02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:33.070
not to come near our person byten mile.

2750
02:25:37.870 --> 02:25:42.530
For competence of life, I willallow you

2751
02:25:42.530 --> 02:25:45.300
that lack of means enforce younot to evils.

2752
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:49.830
And, as we hear you do reformyourselves,

2753
02:25:49.830 --> 02:25:54.270
we will, according to yourstrengths and qualities,

2754
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:57.500
give you advancement.

2755
02:26:02.300 --> 02:26:03.830
Be it your charge, my lord,

2756
02:26:03.830 --> 02:26:07.570
to see performed the tenor ofour word.

2757
02:26:07.570 --> 02:26:08.870
Set on.

2758
02:26:14.530 --> 02:26:16.330
God save the king!

2759
02:26:18.970 --> 02:26:21.000
God save the king!

2760
02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:26.930
God save the king!

2761
02:26:43.730 --> 02:26:45.230
God save the king!

2762
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:46.700
God save the king!

2763
02:26:50.130 --> 02:26:52.970
Master Shallow,

2764
02:26:54.430 --> 02:26:58.300
I owe you a thousand pound.

2765
02:26:58.300 --> 02:26:59.600
Marry, Sir John,

2766
02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:04.700
which I beseech you to let mehave home with me.

2767
02:27:04.700 --> 02:27:08.270
That can hardly be, MasterShallow.

2768
02:27:08.270 --> 02:27:11.470
Do not you grieve at this.

2769
02:27:11.470 --> 02:27:16.500
I shall be sent for in privateto him.

2770
02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:21.300
Look, he must seem thus to theworld.

2771
02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:22.900
Fear not your advancement.

2772
02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:24.970
I shall be the man yet that willmake you great.

2773
02:27:24.970 --> 02:27:26.970
I cannot perceive how,

2774
02:27:26.970 --> 02:27:32.030
unless you give me your doubletand stuff me out with straw.

2775
02:27:32.030 --> 02:27:33.500
I beseech you, Sir John,

2776
02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:37.470
let me have 500 of my 1,000.

2777
02:27:37.470 --> 02:27:40.830
Sir, I will be as good as myword.

2778
02:27:44.330 --> 02:27:48.300
This that you heard was but acolor.

2779
02:27:48.300 --> 02:27:50.770
A color I fear you will die in,Sir John.

2780
02:27:50.770 --> 02:27:54.170
Oh, no, fear no colors.

2781
02:27:54.170 --> 02:27:55.800
Come.

2782
02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:57.430
Go with me to dinner.

2783
02:27:57.430 --> 02:27:58.900
Come, Lieutenant Pistol.

2784
02:27:58.900 --> 02:28:00.230
Come, Bardolph.

2785
02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:04.330
I shall be sent for to him inprivate at night.

2786
02:28:04.330 --> 02:28:06.230
Carry Sir John Falstaff to thefleet.

2787
02:28:07.270 --> 02:28:08.900
Take all his company along withhim.

2788
02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:13.200
My lord.

2789
02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:14.700
My lord.

2790
02:28:14.700 --> 02:28:16.270
I cannot now speak.

2791
02:28:16.270 --> 02:28:17.270
I shall hear you soon.

2792
02:28:17.270 --> 02:28:18.370
Take them away.

2793
02:28:18.370 --> 02:28:24.730
"Si fortuna me tormenta, sperome contento."

2794
02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:30.030
I like this fair proceeding ofthe king's.

2795
02:28:30.030 --> 02:28:31.770
He hath intent his wontedfollowers

2796
02:28:31.770 --> 02:28:35.130
shall all be very well providedfor,

2797
02:28:35.130 --> 02:28:37.370
but all are banished till theirconversations

2798
02:28:37.370 --> 02:28:40.930
appear more wise and modest tothe world.

2799
02:28:40.930 --> 02:28:42.870
And so they are.

2800
02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:45.530
The king hath called hisparliament, my lord.

2801
02:28:45.530 --> 02:28:46.730
He hath.

2802
02:28:46.730 --> 02:28:49.270
I will lay odds that, ere thisyear expire,

2803
02:28:49.270 --> 02:28:54.770
we bear our civil swords andnative fire as far as France.

2804
02:28:54.770 --> 02:28:58.200
I heard a bird so sing, whosemusic, to my thinking,

2805
02:28:58.200 --> 02:29:00.100
pleased the king.

2806
02:30:38.670 --> 02:30:41.670
