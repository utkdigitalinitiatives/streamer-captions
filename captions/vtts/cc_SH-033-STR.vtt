00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100

00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.000


3
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.300
Now, say, Chatillon, whatwould France with us?

4
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.530
Thus, after greeting,speaks the King of France

5
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.070
In my behavior to themajesty,

6
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.400
The borrow'd majesty, ofEngland here.

7
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.600
A strange beginning:'borrow'd majesty!'

8
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.330
Silence, good mother; hearthe embassy.

9
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.370
Philip of France, in rightand true behalf

10
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.000
Of thy deceased brotherGeffrey's son,

11
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.800
Arthur Plantagenet, laysmost lawful claim

12
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.100
To this fair island andthe territories,

13
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.830
To Ireland, Poictiers,Anjou, Touraine, Maine,

14
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.070
Desiring thee to lay asidethe sword

15
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.270
Which sways usurpinglythese several titles,

16
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.670
And put these same intoyoung Arthur's hand,

17
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.800
Thy nephew and right royalsovereign.

18
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.600
What follows if wedisallow of this?

19
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.700
The proud control offierce and bloody war,

20
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.470
To enforce these rights soforcibly withheld.

21
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.470
Here have we war for warand blood for blood,

22
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.270
Controlment for controlment:so answer France.

23
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.100
Then take my king'sdefiance from my mouth,

24
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.470
The farthest limit of myembassy.

25
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.700
Bear mine to him, and sodepart in peace:

26
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.830
Be thou as lightning inthe eyes of France;

27
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.100
For ere thou canst reportI will be there,

28
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.300
The thunder of my cannonshall be heard:

29
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.470
So hence! Be thou thetrumpet of our wrath

30
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.030
And sullen presage of yourown decay.

31
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.530
An honourable conduct lethim have:

32
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.100
Pembroke, look to 't.Farewell, Chatillon.

33
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.200
What now, my son! have Inot ever said

34
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.370
How that ambitiousConstance would not cease

35
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.030
Till she had kindledFrance and all the world,

36
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.570
Upon the right and partyof her son?

37
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.600
This might have beenprevented and made whole

38
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.470
With very easy argumentsof love,

39
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.130
Which now the manage oftwo kingdoms must

40
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.430
With fearful bloody issuearbitrate.

41
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.530
Our strong possession andour right for us.

42
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.200
Your strong possessionmuch more than your right,

43
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.330
Or else it must go wrongwith you and me:

44
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.070
So much my consciencewhispers in your ear,

45
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.770
Which none but heaven andyou and I shall hear.

46
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.430
My liege, here is thestrangest controversy

47
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.930
Come from country to bejudged by you,

48
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.800
That e'er I heard: shall Iproduce the men?

49
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.030
Let them approach.

50
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.130
Our abbeys and ourpriories shall pay

51
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.400
This expedition's charge.

52
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.330
What men are you?

53
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.130
Your faithful subject I, agentleman

54
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.270
Born in Northamptonshireand eldest son,

55
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.430
As I suppose, to RobertFaulconbridge,

56
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.700
A soldier, by thehonour-giving hand

57
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.670
Of Coeur-de-lion knightedin the field.

58
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.700
What art thou?

59
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.500
The son and heir to thatsame Faulconbridge.

60
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.070
Is that the elder, and artthou the heir?

61
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.370
You came not of one motherthen, it seems.

62
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.430
Most certain of onemother, mighty king;

63
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.170
That is well known; and,as I think, one father:

64
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.530
But for the certainknowledge of that truth

65
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.700
I put you o'er to heavenand to my mother:

66
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.530
Of that I doubt, as allmen's children may.

67
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.270
Out on thee, rude man!thou dost shame thy mother

68
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.230
And wound her honour withthis diffidence.

69
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.270
I, madam? no, I have noreason for it;

70
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.700
That is my brother's pleaand none of mine;

71
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.700
The which if he can prove,a' pops me out

72
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.700
At least from fair fivehundred pound a year:

73
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.930
Heaven guard my mother'shonour and my land!

74
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.600
A good blunt fellow. Why,being younger born,

75
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.400
Doth he lay claim to thineinheritance?

76
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.930
I know not why, except toget the land.

77
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.430
But once he slander'd mewith bastardy:

78
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.930
But whether I be as truebegot or no,

79
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.270
That still I lay upon mymother's head,

80
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.830
But that I am as wellbegot, my liege,--

81
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.500
Fair fall the bones thattook the pains for me!--

82
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.170
Compare our faces and bejudge yourself.

83
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.000
If old sir Robert didbeget us both

84
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.500
And were our father andthis son like him,

85
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.800
O old sir Robert, father,on my knee

86
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.230
I give heaven thanks I wasnot like to thee!

87
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.100
Why, what a madcap hathheaven lent us here!

88
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.400
He hath a trick ofCoeur-de-lion's face;

89
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.900
The accent of his tongueaffecteth him.

90
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.900
Do you not read sometokens of my son

91
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.370
In the large compositionof this man?

92
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.400
Mine eye hath wellexamined his parts

93
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.600
And finds them perfectRichard. Sirrah, speak,

94
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.730
What doth move you toclaim your brother's land?

95
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.770
Because he hath ahalf-face, like my father.

96
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.070
With half that face wouldhe have all my land:

97
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.370
A half-faced groat fivehundred pound a year!

98
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.770
My gracious liege, whenthat my father lived,

99
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.400
Your brother did employ myfather much,--

100
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.900
Well, sir, by this youcannot get my land:

101
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.400
Your tale must be how heemploy'd my mother.

102
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.030
And once dispatch'd him inan embassy

103
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.730
To Germany, there with theemperor

104
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.370
To treat of high affairstouching that time.

105
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.330
The advantage of hisabsence took the king

106
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.030
And in the mean timesojourn'd at my father's;

107
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.470
Where how he did prevail Ishame to speak,

108
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.600
But truth is truth: largelengths of seas and shores

109
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.070
Between my father and mymother lay,

110
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.000
As I have heard my fatherspeak himself,

111
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.770
When this same lustygentleman was got.

112
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.870
Upon his death-bed he bywill bequeath'd

113
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.970
His lands to me, and tookit on his death

114
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.900
That this my mother's sonwas none of his;

115
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.470
And if he were, he cameinto the world

116
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.070
Full fourteen weeks beforethe course of time.

117
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.800
Then, good my liege, letme have what is mine,

118
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.970
My father's land, as wasmy father's will.

119
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.100
Sirrah, your brother islegitimate;

120
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.170
Your father's wife didafter wedlock bear him,

121
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.230
And if she did play false,the fault was hers;

122
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.230
Which fault lies on thehazards of all husbands

123
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.930
That marry wives. Tell me,how if my brother,

124
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.770
Who, as you say, tookpains to get this son,

125
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.970
Had of your father claim'dthis son for his?

126
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.070
In sooth, good friend, yourfather might have kept

127
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.900
This calf bred from hiscow from all the world;

128
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.830
In sooth he might; then,if he were my brother's,

129
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.800
My brother might not claimhim; nor your father,

130
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.070
Being none of his, refusehim: this concludes;

131
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.300
My mother's son did getyour father's heir;

132
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.600
Your father's heir musthave your father's land.

133
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.670
Shall then my father'swill be of no force

134
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.200
To dispossess that childwhich is not his?

135
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.600
Of no more force todispossess me, sir,

136
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.570
Than was his will to getme, as I think.

137
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.600
Sirrah, whether thou hadstrather be a Faulconbridge

138
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.670
And like thy brother, toenjoy thy land,

139
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.070
Or the reputed son ofCoeur-de-lion,

140
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.270
Lord of thy presence andno land beside?

141
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.070
Madam, an if my brotherhad my shape,

142
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.770
And I had his, sirRobert's his, like him;

143
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.600
And if my legs were twosuch riding-rods,

144
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.170
My arms such eel-skinsstuff'd, my face so thin

145
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.870
That in mine ear I durstnot stick a rose

146
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.070
Lest men should say 'Look,where three-farthings goes!'

147
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.530
And, to his shape, wereheir to all this land,

148
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.670
Would I might never stirfrom off this place,

149
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.970
I would give it every footto have this face;

150
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.270
I would not be sir Nob inany case.

151
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.000
I like thee well: wiltthou forsake thy fortune,

152
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.570
Bequeath thy land to himand follow me?

153
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:50.230
I am a soldier and nowbound to France.

154
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:55.370
Brother, take you my land,I'll take my chance.

155
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.100
Your face hath got fivehundred pound a year,

156
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.300
Yet sell your face forfive pence and 'tis dear.

157
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.400
Madam, I'll follow youunto the death.

158
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.570
Nay, I would have you gobefore me thither.

159
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.900
Our country manners giveour betters way.

160
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.330
What is thy name?

161
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.530
Philip, my liege, so is myname begun,

162
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:18.530
Philip, good old sirRobert's wife's eldest son.

163
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.270
From henceforth bear his namewhose form thou bear'st:

164
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.470
Kneel thou down Philip,but rise more great,

165
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:31.170
Arise sir Richard andPlantagenet.

166
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.830
Brother by the mother'sside, give me your hand:

167
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.970
My father gave me honour,yours gave land.

168
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.170
Now blessed by the hour,by night or day,

169
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.430
When I was got, sir Robertwas away!

170
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.500
The very spirit ofPlantagenet!

171
00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.900
I am thy grandam, Richard;call me so.

172
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.500
Madam, by chance but notby truth; what though?

173
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.570
Something about, a littlefrom the right,

174
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.870
In at the window, or elseo'er the hatch:

175
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.430
Who dares not stir by daymust walk by night,

176
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.500
And have is have, howevermen do catch:

177
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.630
Near or far off, well wonis still well shot,

178
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:21.300
And I am I, howe'er I wasbegot.

179
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.030
Go, Faulconbridge: nowhast thou thy desire;

180
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.970
A landless knight makesthee a landed squire.

181
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:31.430
Come, madam, and come,Richard, we must speed

182
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.530
For France, for France,for it is more than need.

183
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:46.270
Brother, adieu: goodfortune come to thee!

184
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.870
For thou wast got i' theway of honesty.

185
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.030
A foot of honour betterthan I was;

186
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:05.470
But many a many foot ofland the worse.

187
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.670
Well, now can I make anyJoan a lady.

188
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.370
'Good den, sir Richard!''God-a-mercy, fellow!'--

189
00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.530
And if his name be George,I'll call him Peter;

190
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.230
For new-made honour dothforget men's names;

191
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.670
'Tis too respective andtoo sociable

192
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.130
For your conversion. Nowyour traveller,

193
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.700
He and his toothpick at myworship's mess,

194
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.270
And when my knightlystomach is sufficed,

195
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.970
Why then I suck my teethand catechise

196
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.470
My picked man ofcountries: 'My dear sir,'

197
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.700
Thus, leaning on mineelbow, I begin,

198
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.700
'I shall beseech you'--thatis question now;

199
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.430
And then comes answer likean Absey book:

200
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.270
'O sir, atyour best command' says answer;

201
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.200
At your service; atyour employment sir;

202
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.870
'No, sir,' says question,'I, sweet sir, at yours:'

203
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.130
And so, ere answer knowswhat question would,

204
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.230
Saving in dialogue ofcompliment,

205
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.830
And talking of the Alpsand Apennines,

206
00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.570
The Pyrenean and the riverPo,

207
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:07.600
It draws toward supper inconclusion so.

208
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:13.370
But this is worshipfulsociety

209
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.600
And fits the mountingspirit like myself,

210
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.000
For he is but a bastard tothe time

211
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.300
That doth not smack ofobservation;

212
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.370
And so am I, whether Ismack or no;

213
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.030
And not alone in habit anddevice,

214
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.070
Exterior form, outwardaccoutrement,

215
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:29.670
But from the inward motionto deliver

216
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.800
Sweet, sweet, sweet poisonfor the age's tooth:

217
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.770
Which, though I will notpractise to deceive,

218
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:41.870
Yet, to avoid deceit, Imean to learn;

219
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:47.170
For it shall strew thefootsteps of my rising.

220
00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:50.770
But who comes in suchhaste in riding-robes?

221
00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.230
What woman-post is this?hath she no husband

222
00:11:54.230 --> 00:12:00.070
That will take pains toblow a horn before her?

223
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:08.070
O me! it is my mother. Hownow, good lady!

224
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.330
What brings you here tocourt so hastily?

225
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.730
Where is that slave, thybrother? where is he,

226
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.930
That holds in chase minehonour up and down?

227
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.830
My brother Robert? old sirRobert's son?

228
00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:20.900
Colbrand the giant, thatsame mighty man?

229
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.630
Is it sir Robert's sonthat you seek so?

230
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.870
Sir Robert's son! Ay, thouunreverend boy,

231
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.630
Sir Robert's son: whyscorn'st thou at sir Robert?

232
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:32.030
He is sir Robert's son,and so art thou.

233
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.400
James Gurney, wilt thougive us leave awhile?

234
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.530
Good leave, good Philip.

235
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.600
(laughs) Sparrow: James,

236
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.930
There's toys abroad: anonI'll tell thee more.

237
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.530
Madam, I was not old sirRobert's son:

238
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.930
Sir Robert might have eathis part in me

239
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:54.630
Upon Good-Friday and ne'erbroke his fast:

240
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.230
Sir Robert could do well:marry, to confess,

241
00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:01.370
Could he get me? SirRobert could not do it:

242
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.300
We know his handiwork:then, good my mother,

243
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.270
To whom am I beholding forthese limbs?

244
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.170
Sir Robert never holp tomake this leg.

245
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.300
Hast thou conspired withthy brother too,

246
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.800
That for thine own gainshouldst defend mine honour?

247
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.570
What means this scorn,thou most untoward knave?

248
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:25.400
Knight, knight, goodmother, Basilisco-like.

249
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.870
What! I am dubb'd! I haveit on my shoulder.

250
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:35.430
(laughing) But, madam, I wasnot old sir Robert's son;

251
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.500
I have disclaim'd sirRobert and my land;

252
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.600
Legitimation, name and allis gone:

253
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.330
Then, good my mother, letme know my father;

254
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:51.730
Some proper man, I hope:who was it, mother?

255
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.900
Hast thou denied thyself aFaulconbridge?

256
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.330
As faithfully as I denythe devil.

257
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:08.430
King Richard Coeur-de-lionwas thy father:

258
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:13.100
By long and vehement suitI was seduced

259
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.100
To make room for him in myhusband's bed:

260
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.400
Heaven lay not mytransgression to my charge!

261
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.800
Thou art the issue of mydear offence,

262
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.470
Which was so stronglyurged past my defence.

263
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.830
Now, by this light, were Ito get again,

264
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.870
Madam, I would not wish abetter father.

265
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.530
Some sins do bear theirprivilege on earth,

266
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:45.000
And so doth yours; yourfault was not your folly:

267
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.770
Needs must you lay yourheart at his dispose,

268
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.000
Subjected tribute tocommanding love,

269
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.430
Against whose fury andunmatched force

270
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.000
The aweless lion could notwage the fight,

271
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.530
Nor keep his princelyheart from Richard's hand.

272
00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.730
He that perforce robslions of their hearts

273
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:05.000
May easily win a woman's.Ay, my mother,

274
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.070
With all my heart I thankthee for my father!

275
00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.470
Who lives and dares butsay thou didst not well

276
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.470
When I was got, I'll sendhis soul to hell.

277
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:20.670
Come, lady, I will showthee to my kin;

278
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.270
And they shall say, whenRichard me begot,

279
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:27.870
If thou hadst said himnay, it had been sin:

280
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:34.230
Who says it was, he lies;I say 'twas not.

281
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:51.670
Before Angiers well met,brave Austria.

282
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:56.400
Arthur, that greatforerunner of thy blood,

283
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.730
Richard, that robb'd thelion of his heart

284
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.430
And fought the holy warsin Palestine,

285
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.470
By this brave duke cameearly to his grave:

286
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:07.930
And for amends to hisposterity,

287
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.970
At our importance hitheris he come,

288
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.900
To spread his colours,boy, in thy behalf,

289
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.830
And to rebuke theusurpation

290
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:20.970
Of thy unnatural uncle,English John:

291
00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:25.830
Embrace him, love him,give him welcome hither.

292
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.230
God shall forgive youCoeur-de-lion's death

293
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.270
The rather that you givehis offspring life,

294
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.330
Shadowing their rightunder your wings of war:

295
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.730
I give you welcome with apowerless hand,

296
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.600
But with a heart full ofunstained love:

297
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.670
Welcome before the gatesof Angiers, duke.

298
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.900
A noble boy! Who would notdo thee right?

299
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.030
Upon thy cheek lay I thiszealous kiss,

300
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.900
As seal to this indentureof my love,

301
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.800
That to my home I will nomore return,

302
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.230
Till Angiers and the rightthou hast in France,

303
00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:02.130
Together with that pale,that white-faced shore,

304
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:05.700
Whose foot spurns back theocean's roaring tides

305
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.400
And coops from other landsher islanders,

306
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.770
Even till that England,hedged in with the main,

307
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:14.670
That water-walled bulwark,still secure

308
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.600
And confident from foreignpurposes,

309
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.730
Even till that utmostcorner of the west

310
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.530
Salute thee for her king:till then, fair boy,

311
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:27.670
Will I not think of home,but follow arms.

312
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:32.070
O, take his mother'sthanks, a widow's thanks,

313
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.330
Till your strong hand shallhelp to give him strength

314
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.100
To make a more requital toyour love!

315
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.770
The peace of heaven is theirsthat lift their swords

316
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:44.030
In such a just andcharitable war.

317
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:49.330
(crowd chants) Arthur! Arthur!

318
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.570
Well then, to work: ourcannon shall be bent

319
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.770
Against the brows of thisresisting town.

320
00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:55.270
Call for our chiefest menof discipline,

321
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.400
To cull the plots of bestadvantages:

322
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.930
We'll lay before this townour royal bones,

323
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.800
Wade to the market-placein Frenchmen's blood,

324
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.130
But we will make itsubject to this boy.

325
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.170
Stay for an answer to yourembassy,

326
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.670
Lest unadvised you stainyour swords with blood:

327
00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.530
My Lord Chatillon may fromEngland bring,

328
00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.270
That right in peace whichhere we urge in war,

329
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:15.970
And then we shall repenteach drop of blood

330
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.000
Which hot rash haste soindirectly shed.

331
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.830
A wonder, lady! lo, uponthy wish,

332
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:26.400
Our messenger Chatillon isarrived!

333
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.000
What England says, saybriefly, gentle lord;

334
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
We coldly pause for thee;Chatillon, speak.

335
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.670
Then turn your forces fromthis paltry siege

336
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.570
And stir them up against amightier task.

337
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.970
England, impatient of yourjust demands,

338
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.530
Hath put himself in arms:the adverse winds,

339
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.600
Whose leisure I havestay'd, have given him time

340
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.130
To land his legions all assoon as I;

341
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.230
His marches are expedientto this town,

342
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.000
His forces strong, hissoldiers confident.

343
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.270
With him along is come themother-queen,

344
00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.370
An Ate, stirring him toblood and strife;

345
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.370
With her her niece, theLady Blanch of Spain;

346
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.630
With them a bastard of theking's deceased,

347
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.830
And all the unsettledhumours of the land,

348
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.670
Rash, inconsiderate, fieryvoluntaries,

349
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.500
With ladies' faces andfierce dragons' spleens,

350
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.670
Have sold their fortunesat their native homes,

351
00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.900
Bearing their birthrightsproudly on their backs,

352
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.670
To make hazard of newfortunes here:

353
00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.330
In brief, a braver choiceof dauntless spirits

354
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.570
Than now the Englishbottoms have waft o'er

355
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.200
Did nearer float upon theswelling tide,

356
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.130
To do offence and scath inChristendom.

357

♪Drum beats

358
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.470
The interruption of theirchurlish drums

359
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.300
Cuts off more circumstance:they are at hand,

360
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.630
To parley or to fight;therefore prepare.

361
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:41.570
How much unlook'd for isthis expedition!

362
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.270
By how much unexpected, byso much

363
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.870
We must awake endavour fordefence;

364
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.830
For courage mounteth withoccasion:

365
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:52.200
Let them be welcome then:we are prepared.

366
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.230
Peace be to France, ifFrance in peace permit

367
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.030
Our just and linealentrance to our own;

368
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:14.200
If not, bleed France, andpeace ascend to heaven,

369
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.330
Whiles we, God'swrathful agent,

370
00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:21.800
do correct their proud contemptthat beats His peace to heaven.

371
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.630
Peace be to England, ifthat war return

372
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:36.730
From France to England,there to live in peace.

373
00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:41.930
England we love; and forthat England's sake

374
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.770
With burden of our armourhere we sweat.

375
00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.530
This toil of ours shouldbe a work of thine;

376
00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:52.470
But thou from lovingEngland art so far,

377
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.670
That thou hast under-wroughthis lawful king

378
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.800
Cut off the sequence ofposterity,

379
00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.430
Out-faced infant state anddone a rape

380
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.670
Upon the maiden virtue ofthe crown.

381
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.500
Look here upon thy brotherGeffrey's face;

382
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.070
These eyes, these brows,were moulded out of his:

383
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:13.230
This little abstract dothcontain that large

384
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:18.500
Which died in Geffrey, andthe hand of time

385
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:23.570
Shall draw this brief intoas huge a volume.

386
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:28.030
That Geffrey was thy elderbrother born,

387
00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:32.000
And this his son; Englandwas Geffrey's right

388
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.870
And this is Geffrey's: inthe name of God

389
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:40.430
How comes it then thatthou art call'd a king,

390
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:44.270
When living blood doth inthese temples beat,

391
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:47.870
Which owe the crown thatthou o'ermasterest?

392
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.170
From whom hast thou thisgreat commission, France,

393
00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.800
To draw my answer from thyarticles?

394
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.300
From that supernal judge,which stirs good thoughts

395
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.170
In any breast of strongauthority,

396
00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:03.230
To look into the blots andstains of right:

397
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:07.530
That judge hath made meguardian to this boy:

398
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.670
By whose warrant Iimpeach thy wrong

399
00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:15.170
And by whose help I meanto chastise it.

400
00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.170
Alack, thou dost usurpauthority.

401
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:20.070
Excuse; it is to beatusurping down.

402
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.070
Who is it thou dost callusurper, France?

403
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:28.900
Let me make answer; thyusurping son.

404
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:33.030
Out, insolent! thy bastardshall be king,

405
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:36.930
That thou mayst be a queen,and cheque the world!

406
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:38.200
My bed was ever to thy son

407
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.300
as true as thine wasto thy husband;

408
00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.400
and this boy liker in featureto his father Geffrey

409
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.570
Than thou and John inmanners; being as like

410
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:49.600
As rain to water, or devilto his dam.

411
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.130
My boy a bastard! By my soul,

412
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.400
I think his father neverwas so true begot:

413
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.630
It cannot be, an if thouwert his mother.

414
00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.270
There's a good mother, boy,that blots thy father.

415
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.070
There's a good grandam,boy, that would blot thee.

416
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.730
Peace!

417
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.470
Hear the crier.

418
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.630
What the devil art thou?

419
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.570
One that will play thedevil, sir, with you,

420
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.000
An a' may catch your hideand you alone:

421
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.430
You are the hare of whomthe proverb goes,

422
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:20.270
Whose valour plucks deadlions by the beard;

423
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.330
I'll smoke your skin-coat,an I catch you right;

424
00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:25.900
Look to't Sirrah;i' faith, I will, i' faith.

425
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.230
O, well did he become thatlion's robe

426
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.770
That did disrobe the lionof that robe!

427
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.130
It lies as sightly on theback of him

428
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:35.970
As great Alcides' showsupon an ass:

429
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.070
But, ass, I'll take thatburthen from your back,

430
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:41.200
Or lay on that shall makeyour shoulders crack.

431
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.270
What craker is this samethat deafs our ears

432
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:48.600
With this abundance ofsuperfluous breath?

433
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.930
Lewis, determine what weshall do straight.

434
00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:54.970
Women and fools, break offyour conference.

435
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:02.930
King John, this is thevery sum of all;

436
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.600
England and Ireland,Anjou, Touraine, Maine,

437
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.530
In right of Arthur do Iclaim of thee:

438
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.430
Wilt thou resign them andlay down thy arms?

439
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.600
My life as soon: I do defythee, France.

440
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.200
Arthur of Bretagne, yieldthee to my hand;

441
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.130
And out of my dear loveI'll give thee more

442
00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:24.200
Than e'er the coward handof France can win:

443
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.600
Submit thee, boy.

444
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.500
Come to thy grandam,child.

445
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.000
Do, child, go to itgrandam, child:

446
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.670
Give grandam kingdom, andit grandam will

447
00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:38.000
Give it a plum, a cherry,and a fig:

448
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.700
There's a good grandam.

449
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.000
Good my mother, peace!

450
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.830
I would that I were lowlaid in my grave:

451
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.130
I am not worth this coilthat's made for me.

452
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.530
His mother shames him so,poor boy, he weeps.

453
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.500
Now shame upon you,whether she does or no!

454
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.130
His grandam's wrongs, andnot his mother's shames,

455
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:58.930
Draws those heaven-movingpearls from his poor eyes,

456
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.300
Which heaven shall take innature of a fee;

457
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.330
Ay, with these crystal beadsheaven shall be bribed

458
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:09.030
To do him justice andrevenge on you.

459
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.900
Thou monstrous slandererof heaven and earth!

460
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:18.730
Thou monstrous injurer ofheaven and earth!

461
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:24.130
Call not me slanderer; thou andthine usurp the dominations,

462
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:29.030
royalties and rights ofthis oppressed boy:

463
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:33.270
this is thy eld'st son's son,

464
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.100
Infortunate in nothing butin thee:

465
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.370
Thy sins are visited inthis poor child;

466
00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.630
The canon of the law islaid on him,

467
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.630
Being but the secondgeneration

468
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.230
Removed from thysin-conceiving womb.

469
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.630
Bedlam, have done.

470
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.730
I have but this to say,

471
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.270
That he is not onlyplagued for her sin,

472
00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:55.670
But God hath made her sinand her the plague

473
00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:59.000
On this removed issue,plague for her

474
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.670
And with her plague; hersin his injury,

475
00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:04.670
Her injury the beadle toher sin,

476
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:08.070
All punish'd in the personof this child,

477
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:11.430
And all for her; a plagueupon her!

478
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:15.770
Thou unadvised scold, Ican produce a will

479
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:19.030
that bars the titleof thy son.

480
00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:24.470
Ay, who doubts that? awill! a wicked will:

481
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:28.030
A woman's will; a canker'dgrandam's will!

482
00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.500
Peace, lady! pause, or bemore temperate:

483
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.730
It ill beseems this presence

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:35.070
In brief, we are the kingof England's subjects:

694
00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:24.130
An if thou hast the mettleof a king,

695
00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:27.070
Being wronged as we are bythis peevish town, why then,

696
00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:28.570
Turn thou the mouth of thyartillery,

697
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:30.270
As we will ours, againstthese saucy walls;

698
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:31.870
And when that we havedash'd them to the ground,

699
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:34.630
Why then defy each otherand pell-mell

700
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:39.370
Make work upon ourselves,for heaven or hell.

701
00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:49.730
Let it be so. Say, wherewill you assault?

702
00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:52.700
We from the west will senddestruction

703
00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.070
Into this city's bosom.

704
00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:56.770
I from the north.

705
00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:58.100
Our thunder from the south

706
00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.230
Shall rain their drift ofbullets on this town.

707
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.570
O prudent discipline! Fromnorth to south:

708
00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:06.070
Austria and France shootin each other's mouth:

709
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:09.330
I'll stir them to it.Come, away, away!

710
00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:13.230
Hear us, great kings:vouchsafe awhile to stay,

711
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:16.870
And I shall show you peaceand fair-faced league;

712
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:19.730
Win you this city withoutstroke or wound;

713
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:22.070
Rescue those breathinglives to die in beds,

714
00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:25.230
That here come sacrificesfor the field:

715
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:29.330
Persever not, but hear me,mighty kings.

716
00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:32.830
Speak on with favour; weare bent to hear.

717
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:35.870
That daughter there ofSpain, the Lady Blanch,

718
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:39.470
Is niece to England: lookupon the years

719
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:42.900
Of Lewis the Dauphin andthat lovely maid:

720
00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.170
If lusty love should go inquest of beauty,

721
00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:48.630
Where should he find itfairer than in Blanch?

722
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:51.000
If zealous love should goin search of virtue,

723
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.830
Where should he find itpurer than in Blanch?

724
00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:55.900
If love ambitious sought amatch of birth,

725
00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:00.170
Whose veins bound richerblood than Lady Blanch?

726
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:02.570
Such as she is, in beauty,virtue, birth,

727
00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:05.800
Is the young Dauphin everyway complete:

728
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:10.800
If not complete of, say heis not she;

729
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.670
And she again wantsnothing, to name want,

730
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:17.900
If want it be not that sheis not he:

731
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.600
He is the half part of ablessed man,

732
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.270
Left to be finished bysuch as she;

733
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.770
And she a fair dividedexcellence,

734
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:28.800
Whose fulness ofperfection lies in him.

735
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.200
O, two such silvercurrents, when they join,

736
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.730
Do glorify the banks thatbound them in;

737
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:36.970
And two such shores to twosuch streams made one,

738
00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:40.230
Two such controlling boundsshall you be, kings,

739
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:43.330
To these two princes, ifyou marry them.

740
00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:46.270
This union shall do morethan battery can

741
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:50.100
To our fast-closed gates;for at this match,

742
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:53.270
With swifter spleen thanpowder can enforce,

743
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:56.730
The mouth of passage shallwe fling wide ope,

744
00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:01.530
And give you entrance: butwithout this match,

745
00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:05.130
The sea enraged is nothalf so deaf,

746
00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:08.070
Lions more confident,mountains and rocks

747
00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:11.470
More free from motion, no,not Death himself

748
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:13.630
In moral fury half soperemptory,

749
00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:17.200
As we to keep this city.

750
00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.700
Here's a stay

751
00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.700
That shakes the rottencarcass of old Death

752
00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:36.330
Out of his rags! Here's alarge mouth, indeed,

753
00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:40.530
That spits forth death andmountains, rocks and seas,

754
00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:42.030
Talks as familiarly ofroaring lions

755
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:44.700
As maids of thirteen do ofpuppy-dogs!

756
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.870
What cannoneer begot thislusty blood?

757
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:49.830
He speaks plain cannonfire, and smoke and bounce;

758
00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:52.730
He gives the bastinadowith his tongue:

759
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:55.600
Our ears are cudgell'd;not a word of his

760
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.070
But buffets better than afist of France:

761
00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:02.430
Zounds! I was never sobethump'd with words

762
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:05.470
Since I first call'd mybrother's father dad.

763
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.730
Son, list to thisconjunction, make this match;

764
00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:16.630
Give with our niece adowry large enough:

765
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:19.130
For by this knot thoushalt so surely tie

766
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:23.170
Thy now unsured assuranceto the crown,

767
00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:26.130
That yon green boy shallhave no sun to ripe

768
00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:31.730
The bloom that promiseth amighty fruit.

769
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:34.400
I see a yielding in thelooks of France;

770
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.230
Mark, how they whisper:urge them while their souls

771
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:40.800
Are capable of thisambition,

772
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.670
Lest zeal, now melted bythe windy breath

773
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:47.130
Of soft petitions, pityand remorse,

774
00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:49.900
Cool and congeal again towhat it was.

775
00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.500
Why answer not the doublemajesties

776
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:56.730
This friendly treaty ofour threaten'd town?

777
00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:01.630
Speak England first, thathath been forward first

778
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:06.430
To speak unto this city:what say you?

779
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:10.370
If that the Dauphin there,thy princely son,

780
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:13.670
Can in this book of beautyread 'I love,'

781
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:16.870
Then Anjou and fairTouraine, Maine, Poictiers,

782
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:19.770
And all that we upon thisside the sea,

783
00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:21.870
Except this city now by usbesieged,

784
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:24.270
Find liable to our crownand dignity,

785
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:27.800
Shall gild her bridal bedand make her rich

786
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.300
In titles, honours andpromotions,

787
00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.200
As she in beauty,education, blood,

788
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.170
Holds hand with anyprincess of the world.

789
00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:43.470
What say'st thou, boy?look in the lady's face.

790
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:47.470
I do, my lord; and in hereye I find a wonder,

791
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:48.930
or a wondrous miracle,

792
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:51.570
The shadow of myselfform'd in her eye:

793
00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:53.330
Which being but the shadowof your son,

794
00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:58.900
Becomes a sun and makesyour son a shadow:

795
00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:02.130
I do protest I never lovedmyself

796
00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:05.170
Till now infixed I beheldmyself

797
00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:10.130
Drawn in the flatteringtable of her eye.

798
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.100
Drawn in the flatteringtable of her eye!

799
00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:18.300
Hang'd in the frowningwrinkle of her brow!

800
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.930
And quarter'd in herheart! he doth espy

801
00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:27.430
Himself love's traitor:this is pity now,

802
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.400
That hang'd and drawn andquartered, there should be

803
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:34.200
In such a love so vile alout as he.

804
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.800
My uncle's will in thisrespect is mine:

805
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.430
If he see aught in youthat makes him like,

806
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:43.200
That any thing he sees,which moves his liking,

807
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.470
I can with ease translateit to my will;

808
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:49.100
Or if you will, to speakmore properly,

809
00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:53.270
I will enforce it easilyto my love.

810
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:55.270
Further I will not flatteryou, my lord,

811
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:57.230
That all I see in you isworthy love,

812
00:44:57.230 --> 00:45:00.470
Than this; that nothing doI see in you,

813
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:02.430
Though churlishthoughts themselves

814
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.470
should be your judge,

815
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:07.100
That I can find shouldmerit any hate.

816
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:15.670
What say these young ones?What say you my niece?

817
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:18.330
That she is bound inhonour still to do

818
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:21.200
What you in wisdom stillvouchsafe to say.

819
00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.200
Speak then, prince Dauphin;can'st thou love this lady?

820
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.430
Nay, ask me if I canrefrain from love;

821
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:30.230
For I do love her mostunfeignedly.

822
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:33.330
Then do I give Volquessen,Touraine, Maine,

823
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:36.200
Poictiers and Anjou, thesefive provinces,

824
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.200
With her to thee; and thisaddition more,

825
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.630
Full thirty thousand marksof English coin.

826
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:46.330
Philip of France, if thoube pleased withal,

827
00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:50.400
Command thy son anddaughter to join hands.

828
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.730
It likes us well; youngprinces, close your hands.

829
00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:57.200
And your lips too; for Iam well assured

830
00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.770
That I did so when I wasfirst assured.

831
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:08.630
Now, citizens of Angiers,ope your gates,

832
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:11.230
Let in that amity whichyou have made;

833
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:13.930
For at Saint Mary's chapelpresently

834
00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:17.370
The rites of marriageshall be solemnized.

835
00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:22.600
Is not the Lady Constancein this troop?

836
00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.070
I know she is not, forthis match made up

837
00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:27.230
Her presence would haveinterrupted much:

838
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:29.130
Where is she and her son?tell me, who knows.

839
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:32.400
She is sad and passionateat your highness' tent.

840
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.930
And, by my faith, thisleague that we have made

841
00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:38.630
Will give her sadness verylittle cure.

842
00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.670
Brother of England, howmay we content

843
00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:45.600
This widow lady? In herright we came;

844
00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.270
Which we, God knows, haveturn'd another way,

845
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:50.430
To our own vantage.

846
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:52.430
We will heal up all;

847
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:55.700
For we'll create youngArthur Duke of Bretagne

848
00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.630
And Earl of Richmond; andthis rich fair town

849
00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:02.770
We make him lord of. Callthe Lady Constance;

850
00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:04.330
Some speedy messenger bidher repair

851
00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:06.430
To our solemnity: I trustwe shall,

852
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:08.530
If not fill up the measureof her will,

853
00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:10.670
Yet in some measuresatisfy her so

854
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:14.530
That we shall stop herexclamation.

855
00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:16.130
Go we, as well as hastewill suffer us,

856
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:20.630
To this unlook'd for,unprepared pomp.

857
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:49.000
Mad world! mad kings! madcomposition!

858
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.700
John, to stop Arthur'stitle in the whole,

859
00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.900
Hath willingly departedwith a part,

860
00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.530
And France, whose armourconscience buckled on,

861
00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:59.770
Whom zeal and charitybrought to the field

862
00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:03.100
As God's own soldier,rounded in the ear

863
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:07.830
With that same purpose-changer,that sly devil,

864
00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:10.870
That broker, that stillbreaks the pate of faith,

865
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:14.270
That daily break-vow, hethat wins of all,

866
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:17.300
Of kings, of beggars, oldmen, young men, maids,

867
00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:18.900
Who, having no externalthing to lose

868
00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.600
But the word 'maid,' cheatsthe poor maid of that,

869
00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:30.800
That smooth-faced gentleman,tickling Commodity,

870
00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:36.470
Commodity, the bias of theworld,

871
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.700
The world, who of itselfis balanced well,

872
00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:40.770
Made to run even upon evenground,

873
00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:44.600
Till this advantage, thisvile-drawing bias,

874
00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.130
This sway of motion, thisCommodity,

875
00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:49.870
Makes it take head fromall indifferency,

876
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:53.570
From all direction,purpose, course, intent:

877
00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:55.830
And this same bias, thisCommodity,

878
00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:58.830
This bawd, this broker,this all-changing word,

879
00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:00.870
Clapp'd on the outward eyeof fickle France,

880
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:02.430
Hath drawn him from hisown determined aid,

881
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:04.600
From a resolved andhonourable war,

882
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:09.070
To a most base andvile-concluded peace.

883
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:09.870
(laughing)

884
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:15.070
And why rail I on thisCommodity?

885
00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:18.700
But for because he hathnot woo'd me yet:

886
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.370
Not that I have the powerto clutch my hand,

887
00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:23.670
When his fair angels wouldsalute my palm;

888
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:27.970
But for that my hand, asunattempted yet,

889
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:31.830
Like a poor beggar,raileth on the rich.

890
00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:36.070
Well, whiles I am abeggar, I will rail

891
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:41.500
And say there is no sinbut to be rich;

892
00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.730
And being rich, my virtuethen will be

893
00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:48.270
To say there is no vicebut beggary.

894
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:53.700
Since kings break faithupon commodity,

895
00:49:53.700 --> 00:50:00.230
Gain, be my lord, for Iwill worship thee.

896
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:09.000


897
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:18.930
Gone to be married! goneto swear a peace!

898
00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:27.270
False blood to false bloodjoin'd! gone to be friends!

899
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:35.770
Shall Lewis have Blanch,and Blanch those provinces?

900
00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:40.070
It is not so; thou hastmisspoke, misheard:

901
00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:44.800
Be well advised, tell o'erthy tale again:

902
00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:48.800
It cannot be; thou dostbut say 'tis so:

903
00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.270
I trust I may not trustthee; for thy word

904
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:53.270
Is but the vain breath ofa common man:

905
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:55.270
Believe me, I do notbelieve thee, man;

906
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:59.000
I have a king's oath tothe contrary.

907
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.030
Thou shalt be punish'd forthus frighting me,

908
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:06.670
For I am sick and capableof fears,

909
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:10.630
Oppress'd with wrongs andtherefore full of fears,

910
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:15.770
A widow, husbandless,subject to fears,

911
00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:19.100
A woman, naturally born tofears;

912
00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.700
And though thou now confessthou didst but jest,

913
00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:24.000
With my vex'd spirits Icannot take a truce,

914
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.330
But they will quake andtremble all this day.

915
00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:33.070
What dost thou mean byshaking of thy head?

916
00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:38.530
Why dost thou look sosadly on my son?

917
00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:43.100
What means that hand uponthat breast of thine?

918
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.330
Why holds thine eye thatlamentable rheum,

919
00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:50.030
Like a proud river peeringo'er his bounds?

920
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:54.100
Be these sad signsconfirmers of thy words?

921
00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:59.170
Then speak again; not allthy former tale,

922
00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:05.830
But this one word, whetherthy tale be true.

923
00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:08.000
As true as I believe youthink them false

924
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.400
That give you cause toprove my saying true.

925
00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.200
O, if thou teach me tobelieve this sorrow,

926
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.230
Teach thou this sorrow howto make me die,

927
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:20.600
And let belief and lifeencounter so

928
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.830
As doth the fury of twodesperate men

929
00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:31.630
Which in the very meetingfall and die.

930
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:43.970
Lewis marry Blanch! O boy,then where art thou?

931
00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:50.530
France friend with England,what becomes of me?

932
00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:53.700
Fellow, be gone: I cannotbrook thy sight:

933
00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.600
This news hath made thee amost ugly man.

934
00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:58.170
What other harm have I,good lady, done,

935
00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:00.170
But spoke the harm that isby others done?

936
00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:01.730
Which harm within itselfso heinous is

937
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:04.800
As it makes harmful allthat speak of it.

938
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.700
I do beseech you, madam,be content.

939
00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:13.070
If thou, that bid'st me becontent, wert grim,

940
00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:16.700
Ugly and slanderous to thymother's womb,

941
00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:20.970
Full of unpleasing blotsand sightless stains,

942
00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:25.900
Lame, foolish, crooked,swart, prodigious,

943
00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:29.130
Patch'd with foul molesand eye-offending marks,

944
00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:33.070
I would not care, I thenwould be content,

945
00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:34.670
For then I should not lovethee, no, nor thou

946
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:38.330
Become thy great birth nordeserve a crown.

947
00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:41.870
But thou art fair, and atthy birth, dear boy,

948
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:48.470
Nature and Fortune join'dto make thee great:

949
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:50.700
Of Nature's gifts thoumayst with lilies boast,

950
00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:56.270
And with the half-blownrose. But Fortune,

951
00:53:56.270 --> 00:54:00.630
O, She is corrupted,changed and won from thee;

952
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:03.130
She adulterates hourlywith thine uncle John,

953
00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:06.630
And with her golden handhath pluck'd on France

954
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:09.230
To tread down fair respectof sovereignty,

955
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:14.470
And made his majesty thebawd to theirs.

956
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:21.100
France is a bawd toFortune and King John,

957
00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:26.100
That strumpet Fortune,that usurping John!

958
00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:32.470
Tell me, thou fellow, isnot France forsworn?

959
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:35.530
Envenom him with words, orget thee gone

960
00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:36.630
And leave those woes alonewhich I alone

961
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:38.830
Am bound to under-bear.

962
00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:39.970
Pardon me, madam,

963
00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:43.430
I may not go without youto the kings.

964
00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:55.130
Thou mayst, thou shalt; Iwill not go with thee:

965
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:58.800
I will instruct my sorrowsto be proud;

966
00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:03.170
For grief is proud andmakes his owner stoop.

967
00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:08.570
To me and to the state ofmy great grief

968
00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:13.700
Let kings assemble; for mygrief's so great

969
00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:17.230
That no supporter but thehuge firm earth

970
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:24.170
Can hold it up: here I andsorrows sit;

971
00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:30.430
Here is my throne, bidkings come bow to it.

972
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:34.500
'Tis true, fair daughter;and this blessed day

973
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.570
Ever in France shall bekept festival:

974
00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:38.670
To solemnize this day theglorious sun

975
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:40.330
Stays in his course andplays the alchemist,

976
00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:43.470
Turning with splendor ofhis precious eye

977
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:46.730
The meagre cloddy earth toglittering gold:

978
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:49.570
The yearly course thatbrings this day about

979
00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:52.330
Shall never see it but aholiday.

980
00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:56.000
A wicked day, and not aholy day!

981
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.770
What hath this day deserved?what hath it done,

982
00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:01.670
That it in golden lettersshould be writ

983
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:04.600
Among the high tides ofthe calendar?

984
00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.770
Nay, rather turn this dayout of the week,

985
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:11.470
This day of shame,oppression, perjury.

986
00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:14.230
Or, if it must stand still,let wives with child

987
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:17.400
Pray that their burthensmay not fall this day,

988
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.830
Lest that their hopesprodigiously be cross'd:

989
00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:23.700
But on this day let seamenfear no wreck;

990
00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:26.870
No bargains break that arenot this day made:

991
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:33.230
This day, all things beguncome to ill end,

992
00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:38.330
Ney, faith itself tohollow falsehood change!

993
00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:42.300
By heaven, lady, you shallhave no cause

994
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.400
To curse the fairproceedings of this day:

995
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:47.330
Have I not pawn'd to youmy majesty?

996
00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:51.970
You have beguiled me witha counterfeit

997
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:56.600
Resembling majesty, which,being touch'd and tried,

998
00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:03.600
Proves valueless: you areforsworn, forsworn;

999
00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:07.630
You came in arms to spillmine enemies' blood,

1000
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:11.700
But now in arms youstrengthen it with yours:

1001
00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.630
The grappling vigour andrough frown of war

1002
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:19.670
Is cold in amity andpainted peace,

1003
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:22.900
And our oppression hathmade up this deed.

1004
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:27.070
Arm, arm, you heavens,against these perjured kings!

1005
00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:30.930
A widow cries; be husbandto me, heavens!

1006
00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:32.770
Let not the hours of thisungodly day

1007
00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:35.770
Wear out the day in peace;but, ere sunset,

1008
00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:39.800
Set armed discord 'twixtthese perjured kings!

1009
00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:42.770
Hear me, O, hear me!

1010
00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:44.770
Lady Constance, peace!

1011
00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:51.000
War! war! no peace! peaceis to me a war

1012
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.100
O Lymoges! O Austria! thoudost shame

1013
00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:59.570
That bloody spoil: thou slave,thou wretch, thou coward!

1014
00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:01.470
Thou little valiant, greatin villany!

1015
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:05.730
Thou ever strong upon thestronger side!

1016
00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:10.470
Thou Fortune's championthat dost never fight

1017
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:11.900
But when her humorousladyship is by

1018
00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:16.970
To teach thee safety! thouart perjured too,

1019
00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:21.700
And soothest up greatness.What a fool art thou,

1020
00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:25.070
A ramping fool, to bragand stamp and swear

1021
00:58:25.070 --> 00:58:30.200
Upon my party! Thoucold-blooded slave,

1022
00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:33.200
Hast thou not spoke likethunder on my side,

1023
00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.770
Been sworn my champion,bidding me depend

1024
00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:38.730
Upon thy fate, thyfortune and thy strength,

1025
00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:41.870
And dost thou now fallover to my foes?

1026
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:45.700
Thou wear a lion's hide!doff it for shame,

1027
00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:49.800
And hang a calf's-skin onthose recreant limbs.

1028
00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.800
O, that a man should speakthose words to me!

1029
00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.400
And hang a calf's-skin onthose recreant limbs.

1030
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.630
Thou darest not say so,villain, for thy life.

1031
00:58:57.630 --> 00:59:00.470
And hang a calf's-skin onthose recreant limbs.

1032
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:05.370
We like not this; thoudost forget thyself.

1033
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:13.530
Here comes the holy legateof the pope.

1034
00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:18.930
(♪singing)

1035
00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:27.370
Hail, you anointeddeputies of heaven!

1036
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:38.100
To thee, King John, myholy errand is.

1037
00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:39.830
I Pandulph, of fair Milancardinal,

1038
00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:42.300
And from Pope Innocent thelegate here,

1039
00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:44.430
Do in his name religiouslydemand

1040
00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:48.500
Why thou against thechurch, our holy mother,

1041
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:53.100
So wilfully dost spurn;and force perforce

1042
00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:56.430
Keep Stephen Langton,chosen archbishop

1043
00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:59.830
Of Canterbury, from thatholy see?

1044
00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:01.930
This, in our foresaid holyfather's name,

1045
01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:08.100
Pope Innocent, I do demandof thee.

1046
01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.670
What earthy name tointerrogatories

1047
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:14.870
Can task the free breathof a sacred king?

1048
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:17.830
Thou canst not, cardinal,devise a name

1049
01:00:17.830 --> 01:00:20.800
So slight, unworthy andridiculous,

1050
01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.970
To charge me to an answer,as the pope.

1051
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:28.470
Tell him this tale; andfrom the mouth of England

1052
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:31.100
Add thus much more, thatno Italian priest

1053
01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.400
Shall tithe or toll in ourdominions;

1054
01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.470
But as we, under God,are supreme head,

1055
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:38.430
So under Him that greatsupremacy,

1056
01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:41.530
Where we do reign, we willalone uphold,

1057
01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:45.030
Without the assistance ofa mortal hand:

1058
01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:49.770
So tell the pope, allreverence set apart

1059
01:00:49.770 --> 01:00:52.970
To him and his usurp'dauthority.

1060
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:55.670
Brother of England, youblaspheme in this.

1061
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:57.230
Though you and all thekings of Christendom

1062
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:59.970
Are led so grossly by thismeddling priest,

1063
01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:03.700
Dreading the curse thatmoney may buy out;

1064
01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:07.130
And by the merit of vilegold, dross, dust,

1065
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:09.100
Purchase corrupted pardonof a man,

1066
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:12.700
Who in that sale sellspardon from himself,

1067
01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.930
Though you and all therest so grossly led

1068
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:19.100
This juggling witchcraftwith revenue cherish,

1069
01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.530
Yet I alone, alone do meoppose

1070
01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:24.770
Against the pope and counthis friends my foes.

1071
01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:29.000
Then, by the lawful powerthat I have,

1072
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.700
Thou shalt stand cursedand excommunicate.

1073
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.670
And blessed shall he bethat doth revolt

1074
01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:40.230
From his allegiance to anheretic;

1075
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:43.070
And meritorious shall thathand be call'd,

1076
01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:45.900
Canonized and worshippedas a saint,

1077
01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:50.400
That takes away by anysecret course

1078
01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:55.070
Thy hateful life.

1079
01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:57.700
O, lawful let it be

1080
01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:01.500
That I have room with Rometo curse awhile!

1081
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.100
Good father cardinal, crythou amen

1082
01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.600
To my keen curses; forwithout my wrong

1083
01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.430
There is no tongue hathpower to curse him right.

1084
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:11.800
There's law and warrant,lady, for my curse.

1085
01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.770
And for mine too: since lawcan do no right,

1086
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:18.930
Let it be lawful that lawbar no wrong:

1087
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:23.500
Law cannot give my childhis kingdom here,

1088
01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:26.270
For he that holds hiskingdom holds the law;

1089
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:31.970
Therefore, since lawitself is perfect wrong,

1090
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:35.530
How can the law forbid mytongue to curse?

1091
01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:38.600
Philip of France, on perilof a curse,

1092
01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.770
Let go the hand of thatarch-heretic;

1093
01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:44.030
And raise the power ofFrance upon his head,

1094
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:46.130
Unless he do submithimself to Rome.

1095
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:48.930
Look'st thou pale, France?do not let go thy hand.

1096
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:53.230
Philip, what say'st thouto the cardinal?

1097
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:56.130
What should he say, but asthe cardinal?

1098
01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:58.700
Bethink you, father; forthe difference

1099
01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:00.730
Is purchase of a heavycurse from Rome,

1100
01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:02.970
Or the light loss ofEngland for a friend:

1101
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:04.330
Forego the easier.

1102
01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:06.500
That's the curse of Rome.

1103
01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:09.800
O Lewis, stand fast! thedevil tempts thee here

1104
01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.830
In likeness of a newuntrimmed bride.

1105
01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:14.000
The Lady Constance speaksnot from her faith,

1106
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.530
But from her need.

1107
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:19.000
O, if thou grant my need,

1108
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Which only lives but bythe death of faith,

1109
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.370
That need must needs inferthis principle,

1110
01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:27.830
That faith would liveagain by death of need.

1111
01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:30.970
O then, tread down myneed, and faith mounts up;

1112
01:03:30.970 --> 01:03:33.570
Keep my need up, and faithis trodden down!

1113
01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:36.530
The king is moved, andanswers not to this.

1114
01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:39.670
O, be removed from him,and answer well!

1115
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:43.000
I am perplex'd, and knownot what to say.

1116
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.730
What canst thou say butwill perplex thee more,

1117
01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:51.470
If thou standexcommunicate and cursed?

1118
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:54.630
Good reverend father, makemy person yours,

1119
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:57.530
And tell me how you wouldbestow yourself.

1120
01:03:57.530 --> 01:04:00.330
This royal hand and mineare newly knit,

1121
01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:02.130
And the conjunction of ourinward souls

1122
01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:03.770
Married in league, coupledand linked together

1123
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:07.570
With all religiousstrength of sacred vows;

1124
01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:09.870
The latest breath thatgave the sound of words

1125
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:13.570
Was deep-sworn faith,peace, amity, true love

1126
01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:17.570
Between our kingdoms andour royal selves,

1127
01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:20.030
And even before thistruce, but new before,

1128
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:22.230
No longer than we wellcould wash our hands

1129
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:25.270
To clap this royal bargainup of peace,

1130
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:28.130
Heaven knows, they werebesmear'd and over-stain'd

1131
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:33.900
With slaughter's pencil,where revenge did paint

1132
01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:38.100
The fearful difference ofincensed kings:

1133
01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:43.500
And shall these hands, solately purged of blood,

1134
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:49.470
So newly sworn in faith,so strong in both,

1135
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:53.000
Unyoke this seizure andthis kind regreet?

1136
01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:01.200
Play fast and loose withfaith? so jest with heaven,

1137
01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.470
Make such unconstantchildren of ourselves,

1138
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:08.000
As now again to snatch ourpalm from palm,

1139
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.570
Unswear faith sworn, andon the marriage-bed

1140
01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:16.970
Of smiling peace to marcha bloody host,

1141
01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:20.000
And make a riot on thegentle brow

1142
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Of true sincerity? O, holysir,

1143
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.500
My reverend father, let itnot be so!

1144
01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:33.970
Out of your grace, devise,ordain, impose

1145
01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:40.600
Some gentle order; andthen we shall be blest

1146
01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:44.870
To do your pleasure andcontinue friends.

1147
01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.800
All form is formless,order orderless,

1148
01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.900
Save what is opposite toEngland's love.

1149
01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:57.430
Therefore to arms! bechampion of our church,

1150
01:05:57.430 --> 01:06:00.770
Or let the church, ourmother, breathe her curse,

1151
01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:05.300
A mother's curse, on herrevolting son.

1152
01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:08.100
France, thou mayst hold aserpent by the tongue,

1153
01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.200
A chafed lion by themortal paw,

1154
01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.470
A fasting tiger safer bythe tooth,

1155
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:16.300
Than keep in peace thathand which thou dost hold.

1156
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:21.770
I may disjoin my hand, butnot my faith.

1157
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:25.300
So makest thou faith anenemy to faith;

1158
01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:27.470
And like a civil warset'st oath to oath,

1159
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:31.200
Thy tongue against thytongue. O, let thy vow

1160
01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:35.300
First made to heaven, firstbe to heaven perform'd,

1161
01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:38.030
That is, to be thechampion of our church!

1162
01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:41.000
What since thou sworest issworn against thyself

1163
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.230
And may not be performedby thyself,

1164
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:47.600
For that which thou hastsworn to do amiss

1165
01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:52.070
Is not amiss  if it betruly done,

1166
01:06:52.070 --> 01:06:54.030
And being not done, wheredoing tends to ill,

1167
01:06:54.030 --> 01:06:58.530
The truth is then bestdone not doing it:

1168
01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:03.270
The better act in purposesmistook

1169
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:07.400
Is to mistake again;though indirect,

1170
01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.570
Yet indirection therebygrows direct,

1171
01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:13.330
And falsehood falsehoodcures, as fire cools fire

1172
01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:19.670
Within the scorched veinsof one new-burn'd.

1173
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:25.100
It is religion that dothmake vows kept;

1174
01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.670
But thou hast swornagainst religion,

1175
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:31.170
By what thou swear'st againstthe thing thou swear'st,

1176
01:07:31.170 --> 01:07:34.230
And makest an oath thesurety for thy truth

1177
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:38.900
Against an oath: the truththou art unsure

1178
01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:41.170
To swear, swears only notto be forsworn;

1179
01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:44.770
Else what a mockery shouldit be to swear!

1180
01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:48.570
But thou hast sworn onlyto be forsworn;

1181
01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:52.770
And most forsworn, to keepwhat thou dost swear.

1182
01:07:52.770 --> 01:07:55.000
Therefore thy later vowsagainst thy first

1183
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.770
Is in thyself rebellion 'gainstthyself;

1184
01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:01.500
And better conquest nevercanst thou make

1185
01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:04.030
Than arm thy constant andthy nobler parts

1186
01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:08.800
Against these giddy loosesuggestions:

1187
01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:12.230
Upon which better part ourprayers come in,

1188
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:17.930
If thou vouchsafe them.But if not, then know

1189
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:21.630
The peril of our curseslight on thee

1190
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:26.300
So heavy as thou shalt notshake them off,

1191
01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:30.830
But in despair die undertheir black weight.

1192
01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:37.830
Rebellion, flat rebellion!

1193
01:08:37.830 --> 01:08:38.870
Will't not be?

1194
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:41.470
Will not a calfs-skin stopthat mouth of thine?

1195
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:44.300
Father, to arms!

1196
01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.330
Upon thy wedding-day?

1197
01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:48.530
Against the blood thatthou hast married?

1198
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:51.330
What, shall our feast bekept with slaughter'd men?

1199
01:08:51.330 --> 01:08:53.900
Shall braying trumpets andloud churlish drums,

1200
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:57.100
Clamours of hell, bemeasures to our pomp?

1201
01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:00.700
O husband, hear me!alack, how new

1202
01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:04.900
Is husband in my mouth!even for that name,

1203
01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:07.270
Which till this time mytongue did ne'er pronounce,

1204
01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:09.770
Upon my knee I beg, go notto arms

1205
01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:11.000
Against mine uncle.

1206
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:11.930
O, upon my knee,

1207
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:13.600
Made hard with kneeling, Ido pray to thee,

1208
01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.970
Thou virtuous Dauphin,alter not the doom

1209
01:09:15.970 --> 01:09:17.670
Forethought by heaven!

1210
01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:19.870
Now shall I see thy love:what motive may

1211
01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:22.200
Be stronger with thee thanthe name of wife?

1212
01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.170
That which upholdeth himthat thee upholds,

1213
01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:32.530
His honour: O, thine honour,Lewis, thine honour!

1214
01:09:32.530 --> 01:09:35.900
I muse your majesty dothseem so cold,

1215
01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:39.830
When such profoundrespects do pull you on.

1216
01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:43.070
I will denounce a curseupon his head.

1217
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:57.070
Thou shalt not need. England,I will fall from thee.

1218
01:09:58.530 --> 01:10:01.900
(♪drums)

1219
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:06.770
O fair return of banish'dmajesty!

1220
01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:10.930
O foul revolt of Frenchinconstancy!

1221
01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:15.570
France, thou shalt rue thishour within this hour.

1222
01:10:15.570 --> 01:10:20.230
Old Time the clock-setter,that bald sexton Time,

1223
01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:25.500
Is it as he will? wellthen, France shall rue.

1224
01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:44.070
The sun's o'ercast withblood: fair day, adieu!

1225
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:47.800
Which is the side that Imust go withal?

1226
01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.830
I am with both: each armyhath a hand;

1227
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:53.270
And in their rage, Ihaving hold of both,

1228
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:56.700
They swirl asunder anddismember me.

1229
01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:00.300
Husband, I cannot praythat thou mayst win;

1230
01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:03.370
Uncle, I needs must praythat thou mayst lose;

1231
01:11:03.370 --> 01:11:05.930
Father, I may not wish thefortune thine;

1232
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:09.070
Grandam, I may not wishthy wishes thrive:

1233
01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:13.270
Whoever wins, on that sideshall I lose

1234
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:18.500
Assured loss before thematch be play'd.

1235
01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:23.670
Lady, with me, with me thyfortune lies.

1236
01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:30.470
There where my fortunelives, there my life dies.

1237
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:35.630
Cousin, go draw ourpuissance together.

1238
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:38.930
France, I am burn'd upwith inflaming wrath;

1239
01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:41.730
A rage whose heat haththis condition,

1240
01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:45.270
That nothing can allay,nothing but blood,

1241
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:49.100
The blood, and dearest-valuedblood, of France.

1242
01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:53.300
Thy rage sham burn theeup, and thou shalt turn

1243
01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:58.330
To ashes, ere our bloodshall quench that fire:

1244
01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:02.800
Look to thyself, thou artin jeopardy.

1245
01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:07.170
No more than he thatthreats. To arms let's hie!

1246
01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:15.830
Now, by my life, this daygrows wondrous hot;

1247
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:18.770
Some airy devil hovers inthe sky

1248
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:24.570
And pours down mischief.Austria's head lie thou there,

1249
01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:26.930
While Philip breathes.

1250
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:30.270
Hubert, keep this boy.Philip, make haste:

1251
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:31.870
My mother is assailed inour tent,

1252
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:32.770
And ta'en, I fear.

1253
01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:34.030
My lord, I rescued her;

1254
01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:35.830
Her highness is in safety,fear you not:

1255
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:38.070
But on, my liege; for verylittle pains

1256
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:41.070
Will bring this labour toan happy end.

1257
01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:45.230
So shall it be; yourgrace shall stay behind

1258
01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:47.430
So strongly guarded.

1259
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:50.470
Cousin, look not sad:

1260
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:52.670
Thy grandam loves thee;and thy uncle will

1261
01:12:52.670 --> 01:12:55.600
As dear be to thee as thyfather was.

1262
01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.500
O, this will make mymother die with grief!

1263
01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:02.830
Cousin, away for England! haste before:

1264
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:05.200
And, ere our coming, seethou shake the bags

1265
01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.470
Of hoarding abbots;imprisoned angels

1266
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:09.900
Set at liberty: the fatribs of peace

1267
01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:13.230
Must by the hungry now befed upon:

1268
01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:14.370
Use our commission in hisutmost force.

1269
01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:16.830
Bell, book, and candleshall not drive me back,

1270
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:19.070
When gold and silver becksme to come on.

1271
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:24.000
I leave your highness.Grandam, I will pray,

1272
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.470
If ever I remember to beholy,

1273
01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:31.570
For your fair safety; so,I kiss your hand.

1274
01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.770
Farewell, gentle cousin.

1275
01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:46.770
Coz, farewell.

1276
01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:51.070
Come hither, littlekinsman; hark, a word.

1277
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:53.070
Come hither, Hubert.

1278
01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:04.600
O my gentle Hubert,

1279
01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.900
We owe thee much! withinthis wall of flesh

1280
01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:10.500
There is a soul countsthee her creditor

1281
01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:13.870
And with advantage meansto pay thy love:

1282
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:16.230
And my good friend, thyvoluntary oath

1283
01:14:16.230 --> 01:14:19.170
Lives in this bosom,dearly cherished.

1284
01:14:19.170 --> 01:14:20.830
Give me thy hand.

1285
01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:26.900
I had a thing to say,

1286
01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:31.430
But I will fit it withsome better tune.

1287
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:34.230
By heaven, Hubert, I amalmost ashamed

1288
01:14:34.230 --> 01:14:36.630
To say what good respect Ihave of thee.

1289
01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:38.270
I am much bounden to yourmajesty.

1290
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:40.700
Good friend, thou hast nocause to say so yet,

1291
01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:44.330
But thou shalt have; andcreep time ne'er so slow,

1292
01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:46.630
Yet it shall come from meto do thee good.

1293
01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:53.770
I had a thing to say, butlet it go:

1294
01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:56.370
The sun is in the heaven,and the proud day,

1295
01:14:56.370 --> 01:14:57.930
Attended with thepleasures of the world,

1296
01:14:57.930 --> 01:15:00.630
Is all too wanton and toofull of gawds

1297
01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:04.200
To give me audience: ifthe midnight bell

1298
01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.130
Did, with his iron tongueand brazen mouth,

1299
01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:10.930
Sound on into the drowsyrace of night;

1300
01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:13.300
If this same were achurchyard where we stand,

1301
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:17.130
And thou possessed with athousand wrongs,

1302
01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:20.770
Or if that surly spirit,melancholy,

1303
01:15:20.770 --> 01:15:24.970
Had baked thy blood andmade it heavy-thick,

1304
01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:27.170
Which else runs ticklingup and down the veins,

1305
01:15:27.170 --> 01:15:29.970
Making that idiot,laughter, keep men's eyes

1306
01:15:29.970 --> 01:15:34.270
And strain their cheeks toidle merriment,

1307
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:37.630
A passion hateful to mypurposes,

1308
01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:39.800
Or if that thou couldstsee me without eyes,

1309
01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.230
Hear me without thineears, and make reply

1310
01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:45.570
Without a tongue, usingconceit alone,

1311
01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:48.630
Without eyes, ears andharmful sound of words;

1312
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:51.670
Then, in despite ofbrooded watchful day,

1313
01:15:51.670 --> 01:15:55.900
I would into thy bosompour my thoughts:

1314
01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:03.100
But, ah, I will not! yet Ilove thee well;

1315
01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.200
And, by my troth, I thinkthou lovest me well.

1316
01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.600
So well, that what you bidme undertake,

1317
01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.430
Though that my death wereadjunct to my act,

1318
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:10.670
By heaven, I would do it.

1319
01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:13.130
Do not I know thouwouldst?

1320
01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:18.630
Good Hubert, Hubert,Hubert, throw thine eye

1321
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:24.170
On yon young boy: I'lltell thee what, my friend,

1322
01:16:24.170 --> 01:16:26.830
He is a very serpent in myway;

1323
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:29.100
And whereso'er this footof mine doth tread,

1324
01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:33.470
He lies before me: dostthou understand me?

1325
01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:35.170
Thou art his keeper.

1326
01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:36.400
And I'll keep him so,

1327
01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.100
That he shall not offendyour majesty.

1328
01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:38.930
Death.

1329
01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:39.670
My lord?

1330
01:16:39.670 --> 01:16:41.770
A grave.

1331
01:16:42.670 --> 01:16:45.130
He shall not live.

1332
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:47.730
Enough.

1333
01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:57.530
I could be merry now.Hubert, I love thee;

1334
01:16:57.530 --> 01:17:01.030
Well, I'll not say what Iintend for thee:

1335
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:04.170
Remember. Madam, fare youwell:

1336
01:17:04.170 --> 01:17:07.500
I'll send those powerso'er to your majesty.

1337
01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:10.670
My blessing go with thee!

1338
01:17:10.670 --> 01:17:13.300
Cousin, Away for England, go:

1339
01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:15.330
Hubert shall be your man,attend on you

1340
01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:21.400
With all true duty. Ontoward Calais, ho!

1341
01:17:32.770 --> 01:17:35.270
So, by a roaring tempeston the flood,

1342
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:37.400
A whole armado ofconvicted sail

1343
01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.070
Is scatter'd and disjoin'dfrom fellowship.

1344
01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:46.070
Courage and comfort! allshall yet go well.

1345
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:49.430
What can go well, when wehave run so ill?

1346
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:52.270
Are we not beaten? Is notAngiers lost?

1347
01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:57.030
Arthur ta'en prisoner?divers dear friends slain?

1348
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:59.530
And bloody England intoEngland gone,

1349
01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:03.100
O'erbearing interruption,spite of France?

1350
01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:06.530
What he hath won, thathath he fortified:

1351
01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:09.070
So hot a speed with suchadvice disposed,

1352
01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:11.830
Such temperate order in sofierce a cause,

1353
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:15.270
Doth want example: whohath read or heard

1354
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:16.500
Of any kindred action liketo this?

1355
01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.470
Well could I bear thatEngland had this praise,

1356
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:24.170
So we could find somepattern of our shame.

1357
01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:29.830
Look, who comes here! agrave unto a soul;

1358
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.170
Holding the eternal spiritagainst her will,

1359
01:18:32.170 --> 01:18:37.470
In the vile prison ofafflicted breath.

1360
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:40.230
I prithee, lady, go awaywith me.

1361
01:18:40.230 --> 01:18:45.870
Lo, now I now see theissue of your peace.

1362
01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:48.100
Patience, good lady!comfort, gentle Constance!

1363
01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:52.230
No, I defy all counsel,all redress,

1364
01:18:52.230 --> 01:18:56.330
Save that which ends allcounsel, true redress,

1365
01:18:56.330 --> 01:19:04.170
Death, death; O amiablelovely death!

1366
01:19:04.170 --> 01:19:10.870
Thou odouriferous stench!sound rottenness!

1367
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:14.300
Arise forth from the couchof lasting night,

1368
01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:17.170
Thou hate and terror toprosperity,

1369
01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:20.000
And I will kiss thydetestable bones

1370
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.800
And put my eyeballs in thyvaulty brows

1371
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:26.430
And ring my fingerswith thy household worms

1372
01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:31.530
And be a carrion monsterlike thyself:

1373
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:36.730
Come, grin on me, and Iwill think thou smilest

1374
01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:41.130
And buss thee as thy wife.Misery's love,

1375
01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:42.930
O, come to me!

1376
01:19:42.930 --> 01:19:44.100
O fair affliction, peace!

1377
01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:47.530
No, no, I will not, havingbreath to cry:

1378
01:19:47.530 --> 01:19:49.700
O, that my tongue were inthe thunder's mouth!

1379
01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:53.270
Then with a passion wouldI shake the world;

1380
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:55.400
And rouse from sleep thatfell anatomy

1381
01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.270
That cannot hear a lady'sfeeble voice,

1382
01:19:58.270 --> 01:20:01.430
Which scorns a moderninvocation.

1383
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:04.770
Lady, you utter madness,and not sorrow.

1384
01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:10.630
Thou art not holy to belieme so;

1385
01:20:10.630 --> 01:20:16.230
I am not mad: this hair Itear is mine;

1386
01:20:16.230 --> 01:20:18.370
My name is Constance; Iwas Geffrey's wife;

1387
01:20:18.370 --> 01:20:23.270
Young Arthur is my son,and he is lost:

1388
01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:29.830
I am not mad: I would toheaven I were!

1389
01:20:30.670 --> 01:20:34.370
For then, 'tis like Icould forget myself:

1390
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:38.730
O, if I could, what griefshould I forget!

1391
01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:42.200
Preach some philosophy tomake me mad,

1392
01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:46.270
And thou shalt becanonized, cardinal;

1393
01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:50.200
For being not mad butsensible of grief,

1394
01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.930
My reasonable partproduces reason

1395
01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:56.970
How I may be deliver'd ofthese woes,

1396
01:20:56.970 --> 01:21:02.330
And teaches me to kill orhang myself:

1397
01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:06.430
If I were mad, I shouldforget my son,

1398
01:21:06.430 --> 01:21:09.400
Or madly think a babe ofclouts were he:

1399
01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:14.730
I am not mad; too well,too well I feel

1400
01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:18.800
The different plague ofeach calamity.

1401
01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.270
Bind up those tresses. O,what love I note

1402
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:25.500
In the fair multitude ofthose her hairs!

1403
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:28.600
Where but by chance asilver drop hath fallen,

1404
01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:32.230
Even to that drop tenthousand wiry friends

1405
01:21:32.230 --> 01:21:34.630
Do glue themselves insociable grief,

1406
01:21:34.630 --> 01:21:38.970
Like true, inseparable,faithful loves,

1407
01:21:38.970 --> 01:21:40.930
Sticking together incalamity.

1408
01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:43.730
To England, if you will.

1409
01:21:43.730 --> 01:21:45.600
Bind up your hairs.

1410
01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.530
Aye, that I will; andwherefore will I do it?

1411
01:21:48.530 --> 01:21:51.630
I tore them from theirbonds and cried aloud

1412
01:21:51.630 --> 01:21:53.830
'O that these hands couldso redeem my son,

1413
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:56.500
As they have given thesehairs their liberty!'

1414
01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.070
But now I envy at theirliberty,

1415
01:21:58.070 --> 01:22:00.900
And will again commit themto their bonds,

1416
01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:04.330
Because my poor boy is aprisoner.

1417
01:22:04.330 --> 01:22:08.930
And, father cardinal, Ihave heard you say

1418
01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:14.000
That we shall see and knowour friends in heaven:

1419
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.800
If that be so, I shallsee my child again;

1420
01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:21.030
For since the birth ofCain, the first male child,

1421
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:23.230
To him that did butyesterday suspire,

1422
01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:27.370
There was not such agracious creature born.

1423
01:22:27.370 --> 01:22:31.430
And now will canker-sorroweat my bud

1424
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:35.630
And chase the nativebeauty from his cheek

1425
01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:40.200
And he will look as hollowas a ghost,

1426
01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:44.830
As dim and meagre as anague's fit,

1427
01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:51.200
And so he'll die; and,rising so again,

1428
01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:56.330
When I shall meet him atthe court of heaven

1429
01:22:56.330 --> 01:23:02.670
I shall not know him:therefore never, never

1430
01:23:02.670 --> 01:23:06.070
Must I behold my prettyArthur more.

1431
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:10.870
You hold too heinous arespect of grief.

1432
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:13.130
He talks to me that neverhad a son.

1433
01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:15.700
You are as fond of griefas of your child.

1434
01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:24.370
Grief fills the room up ofmy absent child,

1435
01:23:24.370 --> 01:23:29.000
Lies in his bed, walks upand down with me,

1436
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.470
Puts on his pretty looks,repeats his ways,

1437
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:38.930
Stuffs out his graciousgarments with his form;

1438
01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:42.030
Then, have I reason to befond of grief?

1439
01:23:44.730 --> 01:23:52.170
So fare you well: had yousuch a loss as I,

1440
01:23:52.170 --> 01:23:56.930
I could give bettercomfort than you have.

1441
01:23:56.930 --> 01:24:04.100
I will not keep this formupon my head,

1442
01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:10.800
When there is suchdisorder in my wit.

1443
01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:21.470
O Lord! my boy, my Arthur,my fair son!

1444
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:29.100
My life, my joy, my food,my all the world!

1445
01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:36.470
My widow-comfort, and mysorrows' cure!

1446
01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:44.030
I fear some outrage, andI'll follow her.

1447
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:57.370
There's nothing in thisworld can make me joy:

1448
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:06.870
Life is as tedious as atwice-told tale

1449
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:11.400
Vexing the dull ear of adrowsy man;

1450
01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:14.470
And bitter shame hath spoil'dthe sweet world's taste

1451
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:19.100
That it yields nought butshame and bitterness.

1452
01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:23.770
Before the curing of astrong disease,

1453
01:25:23.770 --> 01:25:25.630
Even in the instant ofrepair and health,

1454
01:25:25.630 --> 01:25:29.530
The fit is strongest;evils that take leave,

1455
01:25:29.530 --> 01:25:35.630
On their departure most ofall show evil:

1456
01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:41.600
What have you lost bylosing of this day?

1457
01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:46.370
All days of glory, joy andhappiness.

1458
01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:49.500
If you had won it,certainly you had.

1459
01:25:51.570 --> 01:25:54.530
No, no; when Fortune meansto men most good,

1460
01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:58.000
She looks upon them with athreatening eye.

1461
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.900
'Tis strange to think howmuch King John hath lost

1462
01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:07.570
In this which he accountsso clearly won:

1463
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:11.230
Are not you grieved thatArthur is his prisoner?

1464
01:26:11.230 --> 01:26:13.830
As heartily as he is gladhe hath him.

1465
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:19.000
Your mind is all asyouthful as your blood.

1466
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.530
Now hear me speak with aprophetic spirit;

1467
01:26:20.530 --> 01:26:23.000
For even the breath ofwhat I mean to speak

1468
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.970
Shall blow each dust, eachstraw, each little rub,

1469
01:26:27.970 --> 01:26:31.000
Out of the path thatshall directly lead

1470
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:41.970
Thy foot to England'sthrone; and therefore mark.

1471
01:26:41.970 --> 01:26:45.170
John hath seized Arthur;and it cannot be

1472
01:26:45.170 --> 01:26:48.400
That, whiles warm life playsin that infant's veins,

1473
01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:51.470
The misplaced John shouldentertain an hour,

1474
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:55.730
One minute, nay, one quietbreath of rest.

1475
01:26:55.730 --> 01:26:57.600
A sceptre snatch'd with anunruly hand

1476
01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:01.330
Must be as boisterouslymaintain'd as gain'd;

1477
01:27:01.330 --> 01:27:03.730
And he that stands upon aslippery place

1478
01:27:03.730 --> 01:27:08.900
Makes nice of no vile holdto stay him up:

1479
01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:15.130
That John may stand, thenArthur needs must fall;

1480
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:20.430
So be it, for it cannot bebut so.

1481
01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:24.200
But what shall I gain byyoung Arthur's fall?

1482
01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:31.670
You, in the right of LadyBlanch your wife,

1483
01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:36.100
May then make all theclaim that Arthur did.

1484
01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:40.030
And lose it, life and all,as Arthur did.

1485
01:27:40.030 --> 01:27:44.600
How green you are andfresh in this old world!

1486
01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:50.900
John lays you plots; thetimes conspire with you;

1487
01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:53.130
For he that steeps hissafety in true blood

1488
01:27:53.130 --> 01:27:55.930
Shall find but bloodysafety and untrue.

1489
01:27:55.930 --> 01:27:59.630
This act so evilly bornshall cool the hearts

1490
01:27:59.630 --> 01:28:03.170
Of all his people andfreeze up their zeal,

1491
01:28:03.170 --> 01:28:05.300
That none so smalladvantage shall step forth

1492
01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:08.030
To cheque his reign, butthey will cherish it;

1493
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:11.470
No natural exhalation inthe sky,

1494
01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:15.200
No scope of nature, nodistemper'd day,

1495
01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.000
No common wind, nocustomed event,

1496
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.730
But they will pluck awayhis natural cause

1497
01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:24.670
And call them meteors,prodigies and signs,

1498
01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:28.130
Abortives, presages andtongues of heaven,

1499
01:28:28.130 --> 01:28:31.670
Plainly denouncingvengeance upon John.

1500
01:28:31.670 --> 01:28:33.300
May be he will not touchyoung Arthur's life,

1501
01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:36.070
But hold himself safe inhis prisonment.

1502
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:42.430
O, sir, when he shall hearof your approach,

1503
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:47.600
If that young Arthur benot gone already,

1504
01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:54.830
Even at that news he dies;and then the hearts

1505
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:57.330
Of all his people shallrevolt from him

1506
01:28:57.330 --> 01:29:02.430
And kiss the lips ofunacquainted change

1507
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:04.330
And pick strong matter ofrevolt and wrath

1508
01:29:04.330 --> 01:29:07.600
Out of the bloody fingers'ends of John.

1509
01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:10.670
Methinks I see this hurlyall on foot:

1510
01:29:10.670 --> 01:29:13.070
And, O, what better matterbreeds for you

1511
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:16.470
Than I have named! Thebastard Faulconbridge

1512
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:20.170
Is now in England,ransacking the church,

1513
01:29:20.170 --> 01:29:23.270
Offending charity: if buta dozen French

1514
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:24.970
Were there in arms, theywould be as a call

1515
01:29:24.970 --> 01:29:28.600
To train ten thousandEnglish to their side,

1516
01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:33.570
Or as a little snow,tumbled about,

1517
01:29:33.570 --> 01:29:39.900
Anon becomes a mountain. Onoble Dauphin,

1518
01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:43.470
Go with me to the king:'tis wonderful

1519
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:45.830
What may be wrought out oftheir discontent,

1520
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:49.430
Now that their souls aretopful of offence.

1521
01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:56.670
For England go: I willwhet on the king.

1522
01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:08.830
Strong reasons make strongactions: let us go:

1523
01:30:08.830 --> 01:30:13.370
If you say ay, the kingwill not say no.

1524
01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:16.300
(♪singing)

1525
01:30:19.770 --> 01:30:21.230


1526
01:30:49.230 --> 01:30:50.830
Heat me these irons hot;and look thou stand

1527
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:53.270
Within the arras: when Istrike my foot

1528
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:55.200
Upon the bosom of theground, rush forth,

1529
01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.100
And bind the boy which youshall find with me

1530
01:30:57.100 --> 01:31:00.700
Fast to the chair: beheedful: hence, and watch.

1531
01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:02.200
I hope your warrant willbear out the deed.

1532
01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:05.400
Uncleanly scruples! fearnot you: look to't.

1533
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.570
Young lad, come forth; Ihave to say with you.

1534
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:28.700
Good morrow, Hubert.

1535
01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:30.630
Good morrow, littleprince.

1536
01:31:30.630 --> 01:31:32.370
As little prince, havingso great a title

1537
01:31:32.370 --> 01:31:36.230
To be more prince, as maybe. You are sad.

1538
01:31:36.230 --> 01:31:38.830
Indeed, I have beenmerrier.

1539
01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:40.070
Mercy on me!

1540
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:42.770
Methinks no body should besad but I:

1541
01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:44.800
Yet, I remember, when Iwas in France,

1542
01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.570
Young gentlemen would beas sad as night,

1543
01:31:46.570 --> 01:31:47.770
Only for wantonness.

1544
01:31:47.770 --> 01:31:49.400
If I talk to him, withhis innocent prate

1545
01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:51.730
He will awake my mercywhich lies dead:

1546
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:56.400
Therefore I will be suddenand dispatch.

1547
01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:00.300
Are you sick, Hubert? youlook pale to-day:

1548
01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:02.070
In sooth, I would you werea little sick,

1549
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:04.400
That I might sit all nightand watch with you:

1550
01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:06.830
I warrant I love you morethan you do me.

1551
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:11.100
His words do takepossession of my bosom.

1552
01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:14.930
Read here, young Arthur.

1553
01:32:17.370 --> 01:32:20.130
How now, foolish rheum!

1554
01:32:20.130 --> 01:32:24.470
Turning dispiteous tortureout of door!

1555
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:26.800
I must be brief, lestresolution drop

1556
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:31.170
Out at mine eyes in tenderwomanish tears.

1557
01:32:35.670 --> 01:32:39.070
Can you not read it? Is itnot fair writ?

1558
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:43.570
Too fairly, Hubert, for sofoul effect:

1559
01:32:43.570 --> 01:32:45.970
Must you with hot ironsburn out both mine eyes?

1560
01:32:45.970 --> 01:32:47.270
Young boy, I must.

1561
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:48.000
And will you?

1562
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.300
And I will.

1563
01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:50.770
Have you the heart?

1564
01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:52.300
I have sworn to do it;

1565
01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:55.200
And with hot irons must Iburn them out.

1566
01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.030
An if an angel should havecome to me

1567
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:59.200
And told me Hubert shouldput out mine eyes,

1568
01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:03.700
I would not have believedhim,--no tongue but Hubert's.

1569
01:33:06.230 --> 01:33:07.670
Come forth.

1570
01:33:07.670 --> 01:33:09.330
Do as I bid you do.

1571
01:33:09.330 --> 01:33:11.870
O, save me, Hubert, saveme! my eyes are out

1572
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:14.100
Even with the fierce looksof these bloody men.

1573
01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:15.530
Give me the iron, I say,and bind him here.

1574
01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:17.730
Alas, what need you be soboisterous-rough?

1575
01:33:17.730 --> 01:33:21.100
I will not struggle, Iwill stand stone-still.

1576
01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:23.400
For heaven sake, Hubert,let me not be bound!

1577
01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:25.670
Nay, hear me, Hubert,drive these men away,

1578
01:33:25.670 --> 01:33:27.500
And I will sit as quiet asa lamb;

1579
01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.930
I will not stir, norwince, nor speak a word,

1580
01:33:29.930 --> 01:33:31.970
Nor look upon the ironangerly:

1581
01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:33.500
Thrust but these men away,and I'll forgive you,

1582
01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:36.770
Whatever torment you doput me to.

1583
01:33:37.530 --> 01:33:40.500
Go, stand within; let mealone with him.

1584
01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:42.870
I am best pleased to befrom such a deed.

1585
01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:48.970
Alas, I then have chidaway my friend!

1586
01:33:48.970 --> 01:33:51.600
He hath a stern look, buta gentle heart:

1587
01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.500
Let him come back, thathis compassion may

1588
01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:55.070
Give life to yours.

1589
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:56.630
Come, boy, prepareyourself.

1590
01:33:56.630 --> 01:33:57.730
Is there no remedy?

1591
01:33:57.730 --> 01:33:59.400
None, but to lose youreyes.

1592
01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:02.170
O heaven, that there werebut a mote in yours,

1593
01:34:02.170 --> 01:34:05.370
A grain, a dust, a gnat, awandering hair,

1594
01:34:05.370 --> 01:34:07.270
Any annoyance in thatprecious sense!

1595
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:09.570
Then feeling what smallthings are boisterous there,

1596
01:34:09.570 --> 01:34:12.700
Your vile intent mustneeds seem horrible.

1597
01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:16.200
Is this your promise? goto, hold your tongue.

1598
01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.670
Hubert, the utterance of abrace of tongues

1599
01:34:17.670 --> 01:34:20.130
Must needs want pleadingfor a pair of eyes:

1600
01:34:20.130 --> 01:34:22.700
Let me not hold my tongue,let me not, Hubert;

1601
01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:25.130
Or, Hubert, if you will,cut out my tongue,

1602
01:34:25.130 --> 01:34:28.570
So I may keep mine eyes:O, spare mine eyes.

1603
01:34:28.570 --> 01:34:31.330
Though to no use but stillto look on you!

1604
01:34:31.330 --> 01:34:35.370
Lo, by my truth, theinstrument is cold

1605
01:34:35.370 --> 01:34:36.870
And would not harm me.

1606
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:39.030
I can heat it, boy.

1607
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:42.830
No, in good sooth: thefire is dead with grief,

1608
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:44.030
Being create for comfort,to be used

1609
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:47.530
In undeserved extremes:see else yourself;

1610
01:34:47.530 --> 01:34:50.500
There is no malice in thisburning coal;

1611
01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.400
The breath of heaven hasblown his spirit out

1612
01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:54.200
And strew'd repententashes on his head.

1613
01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.400
But with my breath I canrevive it, boy.

1614
01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:58.570
An if you do, you will butmake it blush

1615
01:34:58.570 --> 01:35:01.730
And glow with shame ofyour proceedings, Hubert:

1616
01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:04.670
Nay, it perchance willsparkle in your eyes;

1617
01:35:04.670 --> 01:35:07.070
And like a dog that iscompell'd to fight,

1618
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:09.970
Snatch at his master thatdoth tarre him on.

1619
01:35:13.170 --> 01:35:19.670
Well, see to live; I willnot touch thine eye

1620
01:35:19.670 --> 01:35:24.470
For all the treasure thatthine uncle owes:

1621
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:27.130
Yet am I sworn and I didpurpose, boy,

1622
01:35:27.130 --> 01:35:30.730
With this same very ironto burn them out.

1623
01:35:30.730 --> 01:35:32.630
O, now you look likeHubert! all this while

1624
01:35:32.630 --> 01:35:34.070
You were disguised.

1625
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:37.000
Peace; no more. Adieu.

1626
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.030
Your uncle must not knowbut you are dead;

1627
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:43.130
I'll fill these doggedspies with false reports:

1628
01:35:43.130 --> 01:35:48.570
And, pretty child, sleepdoubtless and secure,

1629
01:35:48.570 --> 01:35:51.700
That Hubert, for thewealth of all the world,

1630
01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:53.800
Will not offend thee.

1631
01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:56.530
O heaven! I thank you,Hubert.

1632
01:35:56.530 --> 01:36:01.700
Silence; no more: goclosely in with me:

1633
01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:03.930
Much danger do I undergofor thee.

1634
01:36:05.630 --> 01:36:08.970
(♪ horns play for scene break)

1635
01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:26.630
Here once again we sit,once again crown'd,

1636
01:36:26.630 --> 01:36:30.700
And looked upon, I hope,with cheerful eyes.

1637
01:36:33.970 --> 01:36:38.000
This 'once again,' but thatyour highness pleased,

1638
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.070
Was once superfluous: youwere crown'd before,

1639
01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:44.300
And that high royalty wasne'er pluck'd off,

1640
01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:47.030
The faiths of men ne'erstained with revolt;

1641
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:49.430
Fresh expectation troublednot the land

1642
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:53.000
With any long'd-for changeor better state.

1643
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.170
Therefore, to be possess'dwith double pomp,

1644
01:36:55.170 --> 01:36:57.600
To guard a title that wasrich before,

1645
01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:00.770
To gild refined gold, topaint the lily,

1646
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:02.170
To throw a perfume on theviolet,

1647
01:37:02.170 --> 01:37:04.400
To smooth the ice, or addanother hue

1648
01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.430
Unto the rainbow, or withtaper-light

1649
01:37:06.430 --> 01:37:08.670
To seek the beauteous eyeof heaven to garnish,

1650
01:37:08.670 --> 01:37:11.600
Is wasteful and ridiculousexcess.

1651
01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:16.300
But that your royalpleasure must be done,

1652
01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:20.370
This act is as an ancienttale new told,

1653
01:37:20.370 --> 01:37:23.070
And in the last repeatingtroublesome,

1654
01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:27.000
Being urged at a timeunseasonable.

1655
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.230
In this the antique andwell noted face

1656
01:37:29.230 --> 01:37:31.600
Of plain old form is muchdisfigured;

1657
01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.300
And, like a shifted windunto a sail,

1658
01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:36.570
It makes the course ofthoughts to fetch about,

1659
01:37:36.570 --> 01:37:38.630
Startles and frightsconsideration,

1660
01:37:38.630 --> 01:37:41.470
Makes sound opinion sickand truth suspected,

1661
01:37:41.470 --> 01:37:44.230
For putting on so new afashion'd robe.

1662
01:37:44.230 --> 01:37:47.770
When workmen strive to dobetter than well,

1663
01:37:47.770 --> 01:37:51.730
They do confound theirskill in covetousness;

1664
01:37:51.730 --> 01:37:54.300
And oftentimes excusing ofa fault

1665
01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:56.400
Doth make the fault theworse by the excuse,

1666
01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:59.070
As patches set upon alittle breach

1667
01:37:59.070 --> 01:38:01.370
Discredit more in hidingof the fault

1668
01:38:01.370 --> 01:38:04.000
Than did the fault itself beforeit was so patch'd.

1669
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.970
To this effect, before youwere new crown'd,

1670
01:38:06.970 --> 01:38:09.470
We breathed our counsel: butit pleased your highness

1671
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:15.200
To overbear it, and we areall well pleased,

1672
01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:16.670
Since all and every partof what we would

1673
01:38:16.670 --> 01:38:20.430
Doth make a stand at whatyour highness will.

1674
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:24.570
Some reasons of thisdouble coronation

1675
01:38:24.570 --> 01:38:28.730
I have possess'd you withand think them strong;

1676
01:38:28.730 --> 01:38:31.300
And more, more strong,then lesser is my fear,

1677
01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:34.230
I shall indue you with:meantime but ask

1678
01:38:34.230 --> 01:38:36.930
What you would havereform'd that is not well,

1679
01:38:36.930 --> 01:38:39.200
And well shall youperceive how willingly

1680
01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.300
I will both hear and grantyou your requests.

1681
01:38:45.970 --> 01:38:48.500
Then I, as one that am thetongue of these,

1682
01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:51.170
To sound the purpose ofall their hearts,

1683
01:38:51.170 --> 01:38:56.700
Both for myself and them,but, chief of all,

1684
01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:59.330
Your safety, for the whichmyself and them

1685
01:38:59.330 --> 01:39:04.300
Bend their best studies,heartily request

1686
01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:11.070
The enfranchisement ofArthur; whose restraint

1687
01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:12.730
Doth move the murmuringlips of discontent

1688
01:39:12.730 --> 01:39:16.500
To break into thisdangerous argument,--

1689
01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:23.170
If what in rest you havein right you hold,

1690
01:39:23.170 --> 01:39:26.030
Why then your fears,which, as they say, attend

1691
01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:29.500
The steps of wrong, shouldmove you to mew up

1692
01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:32.100
Your tender kinsman and tochoke his days

1693
01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:34.630
With barbarous ignoranceand deny his youth

1694
01:39:34.630 --> 01:39:37.500
The rich advantage of goodexercise?

1695
01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:43.370
That the time's enemiesmay not have this

1696
01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:47.270
To grace occasions, let itbe our suit

1697
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:51.470
That you have bid us askhis liberty;

1698
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:54.900
Which for our goods we dono further ask

1699
01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:58.170
Than whereupon our weal,on you depending,

1700
01:39:58.170 --> 01:40:03.570
Counts it your weal hehave his liberty.

1701
01:40:06.630 --> 01:40:09.670
Let it be so: I do commithis youth

1702
01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:13.700
To your direction. Hubert,what news with you?

1703
01:40:21.230 --> 01:40:23.930
This is the man should dothe bloody deed;

1704
01:40:23.930 --> 01:40:27.270
He show'd his warrant to afriend of mine:

1705
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:30.400
The image of a wickedheinous fault

1706
01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:33.430
Lives in his eye; thatclose aspect of his

1707
01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:36.570
Does show the mood of amuch troubled breast;

1708
01:40:36.570 --> 01:40:39.000
And I do fearfully believe'tis done,

1709
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.770
What we so fear'd he had acharge to do.

1710
01:40:43.530 --> 01:40:45.300
The colour of the kingdoth come and go

1711
01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:46.800
Between his purpose andhis conscience,

1712
01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:50.230
Like heralds 'twixt twodreadful battles set:

1713
01:40:50.230 --> 01:40:53.030
His passion is so ripe, itneeds must break.

1714
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:55.530
And when it breaks, I fearwill issue thence

1715
01:40:55.530 --> 01:40:58.800
The foul corruption of asweet child's death.

1716
01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:08.430
We cannot hold mortality'sstrong hand:

1717
01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:12.230
Good lords, although mywill to give is living,

1718
01:41:12.230 --> 01:41:15.200
The suit which you demandis gone and dead:

1719
01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:18.000
He tells us Arthur isdeceased to-night.

1720
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.630
Indeed we fear'd hissickness was past cure.

1721
01:41:21.630 --> 01:41:25.670
Indeed we heard how nearhis death he was

1722
01:41:25.670 --> 01:41:29.830
Before the child himselffelt he was sick:

1723
01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:34.000
This must be answer'deither here or hence.

1724
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:52.100
Why do you bend suchsolemn brows on me?

1725
01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:54.800
Think you I bear theshears of destiny?

1726
01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:57.970
Have I commandment on thepulse of life?

1727
01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:02.800
It is apparent foul play;and 'tis shame

1728
01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:05.570
That greatness should sogrossly offer it:

1729
01:42:10.630 --> 01:42:14.470
So thrive it in your game!and so, farewell.

1730
01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:18.470
Stay yet, Lord Salisbury;I'll go with thee,

1731
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:21.470
And find the inheritanceof this poor child,

1732
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:27.430
His little kingdom of aforced grave.

1733
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:31.470
That blood which owed thebreadth of all this land,

1734
01:42:31.470 --> 01:42:37.330
Three foot of it dothhold: bad world the while!

1735
01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:44.130
This must not be thusborne: this will break out

1736
01:42:44.130 --> 01:42:48.970
To all our sorrows, andere long I doubt.

1737
01:42:57.530 --> 01:43:00.530
They burn in indignation.I repent:

1738
01:43:00.530 --> 01:43:03.170
There is no surefoundation set on blood,

1739
01:43:03.170 --> 01:43:06.970
No certain life achievedby others' death.

1740
01:43:06.970 --> 01:43:13.970
A fearful eye thou hast:where is that blood

1741
01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:16.070
That I have seen inhabitin those cheeks?

1742
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:19.530
So foul a sky clears notwithout a storm:

1743
01:43:19.530 --> 01:43:22.570
Pour down thy weather: howgoes all in France?

1744
01:43:22.570 --> 01:43:26.100
From France to England.Never such a power

1745
01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:27.130
For any foreignpreparation

1746
01:43:27.130 --> 01:43:29.530
Was levied in the body ofa land.

1747
01:43:29.530 --> 01:43:32.600
The copy of your speed islearn'd by them;

1748
01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.900
For when you should betold they do prepare,

1749
01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:37.500
The tidings come that theyare all arrived.

1750
01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:40.370
O, where hath ourintelligence been drunk?

1751
01:43:40.370 --> 01:43:43.400
Where hath it slept? Whereis my mother's care,

1752
01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:45.170
That such an army could bedrawn in France,

1753
01:43:45.170 --> 01:43:47.670
And she not hear of it?

1754
01:43:47.670 --> 01:43:50.170
My liege, her ear

1755
01:43:50.170 --> 01:43:54.830
Is stopp'd with dust; thefirst of April died

1756
01:43:54.830 --> 01:44:02.200
Your noble mother: and, asI hear, my lord,

1757
01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:03.670
The Lady Constance in afrenzy died

1758
01:44:03.670 --> 01:44:06.530
Three days before: butthis from rumour's tongue

1759
01:44:06.530 --> 01:44:10.600
I idly heard; if true orfalse I know not.

1760
01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:14.370
Withhold thy speed,dreadful occasion!

1761
01:44:14.370 --> 01:44:16.730
O, make a league with me,till I have pleased

1762
01:44:16.730 --> 01:44:18.870
My discontented peers!What! mother dead!

1763
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:25.870
How wildly then walks myestate in France!

1764
01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:28.100
Under whose conduct camethose powers of

1765
01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:30.930
Thou for truth givestout are landed here?

1766
01:44:30.930 --> 01:44:32.730
Under the Dauphin.

1767
01:44:32.730 --> 01:44:34.770
Thou hast made me giddy

1768
01:44:34.770 --> 01:44:37.070
With these ill tidings.

1769
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:38.200
Now, what says the world

1770
01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:40.770
To your proceedings? donot seek to stuff

1771
01:44:40.770 --> 01:44:43.200
My head with more illnews, for it is full.

1772
01:44:44.170 --> 01:44:45.870
But if you be afeard tohear the worst,

1773
01:44:45.870 --> 01:44:48.900
Then let the worst unheardfall on your head.

1774
01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:52.930
Bear with me cousin, for Iwas amazed

1775
01:44:52.930 --> 01:44:55.030
Under the tide: but now Ibreathe again

1776
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:58.270
Aloft the flood, and cangive audience

1777
01:44:58.270 --> 01:45:01.100
To any tongue, speak it ofwhat it will.

1778
01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:02.630
How I have sped among theclergymen,

1779
01:45:02.630 --> 01:45:04.800
The sums I have collectedshall express.

1780
01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:07.070
But as I travell'd hitherthrough the land,

1781
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:09.930
I find the peoplestrangely fantasied;

1782
01:45:09.930 --> 01:45:11.030
Possess'd with rumours,full of idle dreams,

1783
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:15.000
Not knowing what theyfear, but full of fear:

1784
01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.130
And here a prophet, that Ibrought with me

1785
01:45:17.130 --> 01:45:19.600
From forth the streets ofPomfret, whom I found

1786
01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.270
With many hundredstreading on his heels;

1787
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:24.470
To whom he sung, in rudeharsh-sounding rhymes,

1788
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:25.800
That, ere the nextAscension-day at noon,

1789
01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:29.100
Your highness shoulddeliver up your crown.

1790
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.800
Thou idle dreamer,wherefore didst thou so?

1791
01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:41.600
Foreknowing that the truthwill fall out so.

1792
01:45:44.230 --> 01:45:49.230
Hubert, away with him;imprison him;

1793
01:45:49.230 --> 01:45:51.100
And on that day at noonwhereon he says

1794
01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:54.700
I shall yield up my crown,let him be hang'd.

1795
01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:56.770
Deliver him to safety; andreturn,

1796
01:45:56.770 --> 01:46:01.100
For I must use thee.

1797
01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:03.800
O my gentle cousin,

1798
01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:06.600
Hear'st thou the newsabroad, who are arrived?

1799
01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:09.700
The French, my lord; men'smouths are full of it:

1800
01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:13.130
Besides, I met Lord Bigotand Lord Salisbury,

1801
01:46:13.130 --> 01:46:15.170
With eyes as red asnew-enkindled fire,

1802
01:46:15.170 --> 01:46:16.430
And others more, going toseek the grave

1803
01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:18.800
Of Arthur, who they say iskill'd to-night

1804
01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:21.970
On your suggestion.

1805
01:46:21.970 --> 01:46:24.300
Gentle kinsman, go,

1806
01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:26.830
And thrust thyself intotheir companies:

1807
01:46:26.830 --> 01:46:29.270
I have a way to win theirloves again;

1808
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:31.070
Bring them before me.

1809
01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:36.600
I will seek them out.

1810
01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:40.200
Nay, but make haste; thebetter foot before.

1811
01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:41.570
O, let me have no subjectenemies,

1812
01:46:41.570 --> 01:46:43.770
When adverse foreignersaffright my towns

1813
01:46:43.770 --> 01:46:45.900
With dreadful pomp ofstout invasion!

1814
01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:51.630
Be Mercury, set feathersto thy heels,

1815
01:46:51.630 --> 01:46:53.600
And fly like thought fromthem to me again.

1816
01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.530
The spirit of the timeshall teach me speed.

1817
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:59.830
Spoke like a sprightfulnoble gentleman.

1818
01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:02.370
Go after him; for heperhaps shall need

1819
01:47:02.370 --> 01:47:03.900
Some messenger betwixt meand the peers;

1820
01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:05.170
And be thou he.

1821
01:47:05.170 --> 01:47:06.730
With all my heart, myliege.

1822
01:47:06.730 --> 01:47:10.030
My mother dead!

1823
01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:14.900
My lord, they say fivemoons were seen to-night;

1824
01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:16.670
Four fixed, and the fifthdid whirl about

1825
01:47:16.670 --> 01:47:19.330
The other four in wondrousmotion.

1826
01:47:19.330 --> 01:47:21.000
Five moons!

1827
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.700
Old men and beldams in thestreets

1828
01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:25.170
Do prophesy upon itdangerously:

1829
01:47:25.170 --> 01:47:27.900
Young Arthur's death iscommon in their mouths:

1830
01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:30.500
And when they talk of him,they shake their heads

1831
01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:32.670
And whisper one another inthe ear;

1832
01:47:32.670 --> 01:47:35.670
And he that speaks dothgripe the hearer's wrist,

1833
01:47:35.670 --> 01:47:38.230
Whilst he that hears makesfearful action,

1834
01:47:38.230 --> 01:47:42.000
With wrinkled brows, withnods, with rolling eyes.

1835
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.330
I saw a smith stand withhis hammer, thus,

1836
01:47:44.330 --> 01:47:47.130
The whilst his iron did onthe anvil cool,

1837
01:47:47.130 --> 01:47:49.830
With open mouth swallowinga tailor's news;

1838
01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:52.270
Who, with his shears andmeasure in his hand,

1839
01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:53.870
Standing on slippers,which his nimble haste

1840
01:47:53.870 --> 01:47:56.500
Had falsely thrust uponcontrary feet,

1841
01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:58.800
Told of a many thousandwarlike French

1842
01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:01.800
That were embattailed andrank'd in Kent:

1843
01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:03.830
Another lean unwash'dartificer

1844
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:07.730
Cuts off his tale andtalks of Arthur's death.

1845
01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:15.800
Why seek'st thou to possessme with these fears?

1846
01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:18.630
Why urgest thou so oftyoung Arthur's death?

1847
01:48:18.630 --> 01:48:21.870
Thy hand hath murder'dhim: I had a mighty cause

1848
01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:24.430
To wish him dead, but thouhadst none to kill him.

1849
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:26.770
No had, my lord! why, didyou not provoke me?

1850
01:48:26.770 --> 01:48:29.470
It is the curse of kingsto be attended

1851
01:48:29.470 --> 01:48:31.630
By slaves that take theirhumours for a warrant

1852
01:48:31.630 --> 01:48:35.130
To break within the bloodyhouse of life,

1853
01:48:35.130 --> 01:48:36.100
And on the winking ofauthority

1854
01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:38.470
To understand a law, toknow the meaning

1855
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:40.700
Of dangerous majesty, whenperchance it frowns

1856
01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:45.800
More upon humour thanadvised respect.

1857
01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:52.970
Here is your hand and sealfor what I did.

1858
01:48:52.970 --> 01:48:56.170
O, when the last account'twixt heaven and earth

1859
01:48:56.170 --> 01:48:58.930
Is to be made, then shallthis hand and seal

1860
01:48:58.930 --> 01:49:03.670
Witness against us todamnation!

1861
01:49:03.670 --> 01:49:09.530
How oft the sight of meansto do ill deeds

1862
01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:13.730
Make deeds ill done! Hadstnot thou been by,

1863
01:49:13.730 --> 01:49:16.500
A fellow by the hand ofnature mark'd,

1864
01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:18.830
Quoted and sign'd to do adeed of shame,

1865
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:23.730
This murder had not comeinto my mind:

1866
01:49:23.730 --> 01:49:27.330
But taking note of thyabhorr'd aspect,

1867
01:49:27.330 --> 01:49:29.470
Finding thee fit forbloody villany,

1868
01:49:29.470 --> 01:49:31.700
Apt, liable to be employ'din danger,

1869
01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:34.200
I faintly broke with theeof Arthur's death;

1870
01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:35.430
And thou, to be endearedto a king,

1871
01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:38.100
Made it no conscience todestroy a prince.

1872
01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:39.070
My lord--

1873
01:49:39.070 --> 01:49:43.800
Hadst thou but shook thyhead or made a pause

1874
01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:47.400
When I spake darkly what Ipurposed,

1875
01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:49.530
As bid me tell my tale inexpress words,

1876
01:49:49.530 --> 01:49:52.130
Deep shame had struck medumb, made me break off,

1877
01:49:52.130 --> 01:49:56.170
And those thy fears mighthave wrought fears in me:

1878
01:49:56.170 --> 01:50:00.530
But thou didst understandme by my signs

1879
01:50:00.530 --> 01:50:03.930
And didst in signs againparley with sin;

1880
01:50:03.930 --> 01:50:07.700
Yea, without stop, didstlet thy heart consent,

1881
01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:10.630
And consequently thy rudehand to act

1882
01:50:10.630 --> 01:50:14.200
The deed, which both ourtongues held vile to name.

1883
01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:18.130
Out of my sight, and neversee me more!

1884
01:50:19.570 --> 01:50:22.730
My nobles leave me; and mystate is braved,

1885
01:50:22.730 --> 01:50:25.770
Even at my gates, withranks of foreign powers:

1886
01:50:25.770 --> 01:50:28.370
Nay, in the body of thisfleshly land,

1887
01:50:28.370 --> 01:50:31.730
This kingdom, this confineof blood and breath,

1888
01:50:31.730 --> 01:50:34.230
Hostility and civil tumultreigns

1889
01:50:34.230 --> 01:50:38.570
Between my conscience andmy cousin's death.

1890
01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:45.930
Arm you against your otherenemies,

1891
01:50:45.930 --> 01:50:49.630
I'll make a peace betweenyour soul and you.

1892
01:50:49.630 --> 01:50:53.830
Young Arthur is alive:this hand of mine

1893
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:57.500
Is yet a maiden and aninnocent hand,

1894
01:50:57.500 --> 01:51:00.830
Not painted with thecrimson spots of blood.

1895
01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:02.670
Within this bosom neverenter'd yet

1896
01:51:02.670 --> 01:51:05.930
The dreadful motion of amurderous thought;

1897
01:51:05.930 --> 01:51:08.870
And you have slander'dnature in my form,

1898
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:10.630
Which, howsoever rudeexteriorly,

1899
01:51:10.630 --> 01:51:12.970
Is yet the cover of afairer mind

1900
01:51:12.970 --> 01:51:19.300
Than to be butcher of aninnocent child.

1901
01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:28.000
Doth Arthur live? O, hastethee to the peers,

1902
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.800
Throw this report on theirincensed rage,

1903
01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:32.000
And make them tame totheir obedience!

1904
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.930
Forgive the comment thatmy anger made

1905
01:51:34.930 --> 01:51:37.530
Upon thy feature; for mypassion was blind,

1906
01:51:37.530 --> 01:51:39.430
And foul imaginary eyes ofblood

1907
01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:41.530
Presented thee morehideous than thou art.

1908
01:51:41.530 --> 01:51:44.470
O, answer not, but to mycloset bring

1909
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:45.970
The angry lords with allexpedient haste.

1910
01:51:45.970 --> 01:51:48.900
I conjure thee but slowly;run more fast.

1911
01:52:11.530 --> 01:52:15.670
The wall is high, and yetwill I leap down:

1912
01:52:15.670 --> 01:52:19.130
Good ground, be pitifuland hurt me not!

1913
01:52:19.130 --> 01:52:21.630
There's few or none doknow me: if they did,

1914
01:52:21.630 --> 01:52:26.170
This ship-boy's semblancehath disguised me quite.

1915
01:52:29.230 --> 01:52:33.300
I am afraid; and yet I'llventure it.

1916
01:52:33.670 --> 01:52:36.270
If I get down, and do notbreak my limbs,

1917
01:52:36.270 --> 01:52:38.730
I'll find a thousandshifts to get away:

1918
01:52:38.730 --> 01:52:44.130
As good to die and go, asdie and stay.

1919
01:52:44.130 --> 01:52:50.830
(♪ suspenseful music)

1920
01:52:57.470 --> 01:53:02.970
O me! my uncle's spirit isin these stones:

1921
01:53:02.970 --> 01:53:08.230
Heaven take my soul, andEngland keep my bones!

1922
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:33.470
Lords, I will meet him atSaint Edmundsbury:

1923
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:36.670
It is our safety, and wemust embrace

1924
01:53:36.670 --> 01:53:39.670
This gentle offer of theperilous time.

1925
01:53:39.670 --> 01:53:41.230
Who brought that letterfrom the cardinal?

1926
01:53:41.230 --> 01:53:44.130
The Count Melun, a noblelord of France,

1927
01:53:44.130 --> 01:53:46.100
Whose private with me ofthe Dauphin's love

1928
01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:48.600
Is much more general thanthese lines import.

1929
01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:51.100
To-morrow morning let usmeet him then.

1930
01:53:51.100 --> 01:53:53.670
Or rather then setforward; for 'twill be

1931
01:53:53.670 --> 01:53:59.070
Two long days' journey,lords, or ere we meet.

1932
01:53:59.070 --> 01:54:05.330
Once more to-day well met,distemper'd lords!

1933
01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:08.430
The king by me requestsyour presence straight.

1934
01:54:08.430 --> 01:54:13.230
The king hath dispossess'dhimself of us:

1935
01:54:13.230 --> 01:54:15.030
We will not line his thinbestained cloak

1936
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:17.500
With our pure honours, norattend the foot

1937
01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:19.800
That leaves the print ofblood where'er it walks.

1938
01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:22.930
Return and tell him so: weknow the worst.

1939
01:54:22.930 --> 01:54:27.130
Whate'er you think, goodwords, I think, were best.

1940
01:54:27.130 --> 01:54:29.400
Our griefs, and not ourmanners, reason now.

1941
01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:30.730
But there is little reasonin your grief;

1942
01:54:30.730 --> 01:54:32.530
Therefore 'twere reasonyou had manners now.

1943
01:54:32.530 --> 01:54:35.500
Sir, sir, impatience hathhis privilege.

1944
01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:37.570
'Tis true, to hurt hismaster, no man else.

1945
01:54:37.570 --> 01:54:45.800
This is the prison. Whatis he lies here?

1946
01:54:57.870 --> 01:55:04.070
O death, made proud withpure and princely beauty!

1947
01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:11.870
The earth had not a holeto hide this deed.

1948
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:16.600
Murder, as hating whathimself hath done,

1949
01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:20.100
Doth lay it open to urgeon revenge.

1950
01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:23.500
Or, when he doom'd thisbeauty to a grave,

1951
01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:27.870
Found it too precious-princelyfor a grave.

1952
01:55:27.870 --> 01:55:32.100
Sir Richard, what thinkyou? have you beheld,

1953
01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:35.400
Or have you read or heard?or could you think?

1954
01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:38.300
Or do you almost think,although you see,

1955
01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:41.930
That you do see? couldthought, without this object,

1956
01:55:41.930 --> 01:55:45.770
Form such another? This isthe very top,

1957
01:55:45.770 --> 01:55:49.630
The height, the crest, orcrest unto the crest,

1958
01:55:49.630 --> 01:55:53.400
Of murder's arms: this isthe wildest savagery,

1959
01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:54.530
the vilest stroke,

1960
01:55:54.530 --> 01:55:57.200
That ever wall-eyedwrath or staring rage

1961
01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:02.130
Presented to the tears ofsoft remorse.

1962
01:56:02.130 --> 01:56:08.400
All murders past do standexcused in this:

1963
01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:12.070
And this, so sole and sounmatchable,

1964
01:56:12.070 --> 01:56:15.100
Shall give a holiness, apurity,

1965
01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:18.500
To the yet unbegotten sinof times;

1966
01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:23.800
And prove a deadlybloodshed but a jest,

1967
01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:28.970
Exampled by this heinousspectacle.

1968
01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:34.330
It is a damned and abloody work;

1969
01:56:34.330 --> 01:56:37.970
The graceless action of aheavy hand,

1970
01:56:37.970 --> 01:56:41.530
If that it be the work ofany hand.

1971
01:56:41.530 --> 01:56:44.670
If that it be the work ofany hand!

1972
01:56:44.670 --> 01:56:46.530
We had a kind of lightwhat would ensue:

1973
01:56:46.530 --> 01:56:49.000
It is the shameful work ofHubert's hand;

1974
01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.630
The practise and thepurpose of the king:

1975
01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:59.630
From whose obedience Iforbid my soul,

1976
01:56:59.630 --> 01:57:03.500
Kneeling before this ruinof sweet life,

1977
01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:05.670
And breathing to hisbreathless excellence

1978
01:57:05.670 --> 01:57:09.570
The incense of a vow, aholy vow,

1979
01:57:09.570 --> 01:57:11.330
Never to taste thepleasures of the world,

1980
01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:13.470
Never to be infected withdelight,

1981
01:57:13.470 --> 01:57:16.530
Nor conversant with easeor idleness,

1982
01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:19.030
Till I have set a glory tothis hand,

1983
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:23.100
By giving it the worshipof revenge.

1984
01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:26.370
Our souls religiouslyconfirm thy words.

1985
01:57:26.830 --> 01:57:32.170
Lords, I am hot with hastein seeking you:

1986
01:57:32.170 --> 01:57:35.930
Arthur doth live; the kinghath sent for you.

1987
01:57:37.630 --> 01:57:40.970
O, he is bold and blushesnot at death.

1988
01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:43.330
Avaunt, thou hatefulvillain, get thee gone!

1989
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:48.630
I am no villain.

1990
01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:51.730
Must I rob the law?

1991
01:57:51.730 --> 01:57:53.730
Your sword is bright, sir;put it up again.

1992
01:57:53.730 --> 01:57:55.830
Not till I sheathe it in amurderer's skin.

1993
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:58.600
Stand back, Lord Salisbury,stand back, I say;

1994
01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:02.170
By heaven, I think mysword's as sharp as yours:

1995
01:58:02.170 --> 01:58:05.330
I would not have you,lord, forget yourself,

1996
01:58:05.330 --> 01:58:08.400
Nor tempt the danger of mytrue defence;

1997
01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:11.300
Lest I, by marking of yourrage, forget

1998
01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:15.730
Your worth, your greatnessand nobility.

1999
01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.870
Out, dunghill! darest thoubrave a nobleman?

2000
01:58:18.870 --> 01:58:20.670
Not for my life: but yet Idare defend

2001
01:58:20.670 --> 01:58:22.970
My innocent life againstan emperor.

2002
01:58:22.970 --> 01:58:24.300
Thou art a murderer.

2003
01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:26.800
Do not prove me so;

2004
01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:30.930
Yet I am none: whose tonguesoe'er speaks false,

2005
01:58:30.930 --> 01:58:34.900
Not truly speaks; whospeaks not truly, lies.

2006
01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:36.300
Cut him to pieces.

2007
01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:37.730
Keep the peace, I say.

2008
01:58:37.730 --> 01:58:40.030
Stand by, or I shall gallyou, Faulconbridge.

2009
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:42.830
Thou wert better gall thedevil, Salisbury:

2010
01:58:42.830 --> 01:58:45.230
If thou but frown on me,or stir thy foot,

2011
01:58:45.230 --> 01:58:47.570
Or teach thy hasty spleento do me shame,

2012
01:58:47.570 --> 01:58:53.830
I'll strike thee dead. Putup thy sword betime;

2013
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:57.430
Or I'll so maul you andyour toasting-iron,

2014
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:59.130
That you shall think thedevil is come from hell.

2015
01:58:59.130 --> 01:59:01.900
What wilt thou do,renowned Faulconbridge?

2016
01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:03.600
Second a villain and amurderer?

2017
01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:05.600
Lord Bigot, I am none.

2018
01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:07.670
Who kill'd this prince?

2019
01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:34.230
'Tis not an hour since Ileft him well:

2020
01:59:34.230 --> 01:59:41.570
I honour'd him, I lovedhim, and will weep

2021
01:59:41.570 --> 01:59:47.700
My date of life out forhis sweet life's loss.

2022
01:59:52.630 --> 01:59:55.730
Trust not those cunningwaters of his eyes,

2023
01:59:55.730 --> 01:59:58.230
For villany is not withoutsuch rheum;

2024
01:59:58.230 --> 02:00:00.530
And he, long traded in it,makes it seem

2025
02:00:00.530 --> 02:00:03.370
Like rivers of remorse andinnocency.

2026
02:00:03.370 --> 02:00:06.130
Away with me, all youwhose souls abhor

2027
02:00:06.130 --> 02:00:09.200
The uncleanly savours of aslaughter-house;

2028
02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:12.900
For I am stifled with thissmell of sin.

2029
02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:18.670
Away toward Bury, to theDauphin there!

2030
02:00:19.530 --> 02:00:23.070
There tell the king he mayinquire us out.

2031
02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:52.770
Here's a good world! Knewyou of this fair work?

2032
02:00:52.770 --> 02:00:54.530
Beyond the infinite andboundless reach

2033
02:00:54.530 --> 02:00:56.870
Of mercy, if thou didstthis deed of death,

2034
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:57.930
Art thou damn'd, Hubert.

2035
02:00:57.930 --> 02:00:58.870
Do but hear me, sir.

2036
02:00:58.870 --> 02:01:01.600
Ha! I'll tell thee what;

2037
02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:06.870
Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay,nothing is so black;

2038
02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:09.870
Thou art more deep damn'dthan Prince Lucifer:

2039
02:01:09.870 --> 02:01:12.330
There is not yet so ugly afiend of hell

2040
02:01:12.330 --> 02:01:14.100
As thou shalt be, if thoudidst kill this child.

2041
02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:15.100
Upon my soul--

2042
02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:17.800
If thou didst but consent

2043
02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:26.930
To this most cruel act, dobut despair;

2044
02:01:26.930 --> 02:01:29.070
And if thou want'st acord, the smallest thread

2045
02:01:29.070 --> 02:01:30.770
That ever spider twistedfrom her womb

2046
02:01:30.770 --> 02:01:34.030
Will serve to stranglethee, a rush will be a beam

2047
02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:36.930
To hang thee on; or wouldstthou drown thyself,

2048
02:01:36.930 --> 02:01:38.200
Put but a little water ina spoon,

2049
02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:40.570
And it shall be as all theocean,

2050
02:01:40.570 --> 02:01:44.630
Enough to stifle such avillain up.

2051
02:01:44.630 --> 02:01:48.370
I do suspect thee verygrievously.

2052
02:01:48.370 --> 02:01:55.700
If I in act, consent, orsin of thought,

2053
02:01:55.700 --> 02:01:58.670
Be guilty of the stealingthat sweet breath

2054
02:01:58.670 --> 02:02:03.530
Which was embounded inthis beauteous clay,

2055
02:02:03.530 --> 02:02:06.770
Let hell want pains enoughto torture me.

2056
02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:08.770
I left him well.

2057
02:02:11.370 --> 02:02:18.170
Go, bear him in thinearms.

2058
02:02:18.170 --> 02:02:20.930
I am amazed, methinks, andlose my way

2059
02:02:20.930 --> 02:02:24.970
Among the thorns anddangers of this world.

2060
02:02:25.870 --> 02:02:30.570
How easy dost thou takeall England up!

2061
02:02:30.570 --> 02:02:33.830
From forth this morsel ofdead royalty,

2062
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:36.500
The life, the right andtruth of all this realm

2063
02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:38.570
Is fled to heaven; andEngland now is left

2064
02:02:38.570 --> 02:02:40.900
To tug and scamble and topart by the teeth

2065
02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:46.830
The unowed interest ofproud-swelling state.

2066
02:02:46.830 --> 02:02:49.370
Now for the bare-pick'dbone of majesty

2067
02:02:49.370 --> 02:02:52.300
Doth dogged war bristlehis angry crest

2068
02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:54.100
And snarleth in the gentleeyes of peace:

2069
02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:57.100
Now powers from home anddiscontents at home

2070
02:02:57.100 --> 02:03:00.730
Meet in one line; and vastconfusion waits,

2071
02:03:00.730 --> 02:03:02.630
As doth a raven on asick-fall'n beast,

2072
02:03:02.630 --> 02:03:07.200
The imminent decay ofwrested pomp.

2073
02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:08.570
Now happy he whose cloakand cincture can

2074
02:03:08.570 --> 02:03:10.570
Hold out this tempest.Bear away that child

2075
02:03:10.570 --> 02:03:13.070
And follow me with speed:I'll to the king:

2076
02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:14.800
A thousand businesses arebrief in hand,

2077
02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:17.230
And heaven itself dothfrown upon the land.

2078
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:20.970
(♪singing)

2079
02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:25.630
Thus have I yielded upinto your hand

2080
02:03:25.630 --> 02:03:28.400
The circle of my glory.

2081
02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:33.900
Take again, from this my hand,as holding of the pope

2082
02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:38.500
Your sovereign greatnessand authority.

2083
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:50.670
Now keep your holy word:go meet the French,

2084
02:03:50.670 --> 02:03:52.570
And from his holiness useall your power

2085
02:03:52.570 --> 02:03:56.030
To stop their marches'fore we are inflamed.

2086
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:58.470
Our discontented countiesdo revolt;

2087
02:03:58.470 --> 02:04:00.500
Our people quarrel withobedience,

2088
02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:02.330
Swearing allegiance andthe love of soul

2089
02:04:02.330 --> 02:04:05.770
To stranger blood, toforeign royalty.

2090
02:04:05.770 --> 02:04:07.930
This inundation ofmistemper'd humour

2091
02:04:07.930 --> 02:04:10.870
Rests by you only to bequalified:

2092
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:14.330
Then pause not; for thepresent time's so sick,

2093
02:04:14.330 --> 02:04:17.030
That present medicine mustbe minister'd,

2094
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:20.500
Or overthrow incurableensues.

2095
02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:24.670
It was my breath that blewthis tempest up,

2096
02:04:24.670 --> 02:04:28.500
Upon your stubborn usageof the pope;

2097
02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:30.830
But now you are a gentleconvertite,

2098
02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:34.600
My tongue shall hush againthis storm of war

2099
02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:38.700
And make fair weather inyour blustering land.

2100
02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:43.300
On this Ascension-day,remember well,

2101
02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:47.500
Upon your oath of serviceto the pope,

2102
02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:51.500
Go I to make the Frenchlay down their arms.

2103
02:05:03.070 --> 02:05:06.170
Is this Ascension-day?Did not the prophet

2104
02:05:06.170 --> 02:05:08.400
Say that beforeAscension-day at noon

2105
02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:13.900
My crown I should giveoff? Even so I have:

2106
02:05:13.900 --> 02:05:16.300
I did suppose it should beon constraint:

2107
02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:19.200
But, heaven be thank'd, itis but voluntary.

2108
02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:22.230
All Kent hath yielded;nothing there holds out

2109
02:05:22.230 --> 02:05:23.830
But Dover castle: Londonhath received,

2110
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:26.270
Like a kind host, theDauphin and his powers:

2111
02:05:26.270 --> 02:05:27.630
Your nobles will not hearyou, but are gone

2112
02:05:27.630 --> 02:05:29.270
To offer service to yourenemy,

2113
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:30.500
And wild amazement hurriesup and down

2114
02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:34.270
The little number of yourdoubtful friends.

2115
02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:37.430
Would not my lords returnto me again,

2116
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:39.770
After they heard youngArthur was alive?

2117
02:05:39.770 --> 02:05:41.700
They found him dead andcast into the streets,

2118
02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:43.400
An empty casket, where thejewel of life

2119
02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:46.030
By some damn'd hand wasrobb'd and ta'en away.

2120
02:05:46.030 --> 02:05:48.430
That villain Hubert toldme he did live.

2121
02:05:48.430 --> 02:05:52.270
So, on my soul, he did,for aught he knew.

2122
02:05:59.870 --> 02:06:04.400
But wherefore do youdroop? why look you sad?

2123
02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:09.030
Be great in act, as youhave been in thought;

2124
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:12.100
Let not the world see fearand sad distrust

2125
02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:14.100
Govern the motion of akingly eye:

2126
02:06:14.100 --> 02:06:16.630
Be stirring as the time;be fire with fire;

2127
02:06:16.630 --> 02:06:18.530
Threaten the threatenerand outface the brow

2128
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:20.970
Of bragging horror: soshall inferior eyes,

2129
02:06:20.970 --> 02:06:23.300
That borrow theirbehaviors from the great,

2130
02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:25.500
Grow great by your exampleand put on

2131
02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:28.100
The dauntless spirit ofresolution.

2132
02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:30.700
Away, and glister like thegod of war,

2133
02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:33.330
When he intendeth tobecome the field:

2134
02:06:33.330 --> 02:06:42.670
Show boldness and aspiringconfidence.

2135
02:06:42.670 --> 02:06:49.370
What, shall they seek thelion in his den,

2136
02:06:49.370 --> 02:06:53.600
And fright him there? andmake him tremble there?

2137
02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:57.500
O, let it not be said:forage, and run

2138
02:06:57.500 --> 02:06:59.500
To meet displeasurefarther from the doors,

2139
02:06:59.500 --> 02:07:02.170
And grapple with him erehe comes so nigh.

2140
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:10.330
The legate of the popehath been with me,

2141
02:07:10.330 --> 02:07:14.200
And I have made a happypeace with him;

2142
02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:16.470
And he hath promised todismiss the powers

2143
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:20.200
Led by the Dauphin.

2144
02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:26.070
O inglorious league!

2145
02:07:26.070 --> 02:07:30.100
Shall we, upon the footingof our land,

2146
02:07:30.100 --> 02:07:32.600
Send fair-play orders andmake compromise,

2147
02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:35.730
Insinuation, parley andbase truce

2148
02:07:35.730 --> 02:07:39.270
To arms invasive? shall abeardless boy,

2149
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:42.930
A cocker'd silken wanton,brave our fields,

2150
02:07:42.930 --> 02:07:45.070
And flesh his spirit in awarlike soil,

2151
02:07:45.070 --> 02:07:46.930
Mocking the air withcolours idly spread,

2152
02:07:46.930 --> 02:07:51.400
And find no cheque? Letus, my liege, to arms:

2153
02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:54.200
Perchance the cardinalcannot make your peace;

2154
02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:56.130
Or if he do, let it atleast be said

2155
02:07:56.130 --> 02:07:59.570
They saw we had a purposeof defence.

2156
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:18.930
Have thou the ordering ofthis present time.

2157
02:08:19.700 --> 02:08:32.000
Away, then, with goodcourage! yet, I know,

2158
02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:33.930
Our party may well meet aprouder foe.

2159
02:08:33.930 --> 02:08:37.300
(♪music to end scene)

2160
02:08:40.170 --> 02:08:46.470


2161
02:08:56.630 --> 02:08:59.300
My Lord Melun, let this becopied out,

2162
02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:01.430
And keep it safe for ourremembrance:

2163
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:04.230
Return the precedent tothese lords again;

2164
02:09:04.230 --> 02:09:06.300
That, having our fairorder written down,

2165
02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:10.100
Both they and we, perusingo'er these notes,

2166
02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:12.800
May know wherefore we tookthe sacrament

2167
02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:15.470
And keep our faiths firmand inviolable.

2168
02:09:15.470 --> 02:09:18.000
Upon our sides it nevershall be broken.

2169
02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.230
And, noble Dauphin, albeitwe swear

2170
02:09:21.230 --> 02:09:23.000
A voluntary zeal and anunurged faith

2171
02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.370
To your proceedings; yetbelieve me, prince,

2172
02:09:26.370 --> 02:09:29.300
I am not glad that such asore of time

2173
02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:31.970
Should seek a plaster bycontemn'd revolt,

2174
02:09:31.970 --> 02:09:34.330
And heal the inveteratecanker of one wound

2175
02:09:34.330 --> 02:09:39.000
By making many. O, itgrieves my soul,

2176
02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.870
That I must draw thismetal from my side

2177
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:47.230
To be a widow-maker! O,and there

2178
02:09:47.230 --> 02:09:49.770
Where honourable rescueand defence

2179
02:09:49.770 --> 02:09:54.430
Cries out upon the name ofSalisbury!

2180
02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:58.870
But such is the infectionof the time,

2181
02:09:58.870 --> 02:10:00.670
That, for the health andphysic of our right,

2182
02:10:00.670 --> 02:10:02.470
We cannot deal but withthe very hand

2183
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:07.270
Of stern injustice andconfused wrong.

2184
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:09.270
And is't not pity, O mygrieved friends,

2185
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:12.470
That we, the sons andchildren of this isle,

2186
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:15.570
Were born to see so sad anhour as this;

2187
02:10:15.570 --> 02:10:18.100
Wherein we step after astranger march

2188
02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:22.300
Upon her gentle bosom, andfill up

2189
02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:28.500
Her enemies' ranks,--Imust withdraw and weep

2190
02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:34.130
Upon the spot of thisenforced cause,--

2191
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:39.000
To grace the gentry of aland remote,

2192
02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:42.630
And follow unacquaintedcolours here?

2193
02:10:42.630 --> 02:10:48.130
What, here? O nation, thatthou couldst remove!

2194
02:10:48.130 --> 02:10:50.930
That Neptune's arms, whoclippeth thee about,

2195
02:10:50.930 --> 02:10:53.070
Would bear thee from theknowledge of thyself,

2196
02:10:53.070 --> 02:10:56.430
And grapple thee unto apagan shore;

2197
02:10:56.430 --> 02:10:59.270
Where these two Christianarmies might combine

2198
02:10:59.270 --> 02:11:03.030
The blood of malice in avein of league,

2199
02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:07.500
And not to spend it sounneighbourly!

2200
02:11:14.770 --> 02:11:17.730
A noble temper dost thoushow in this;

2201
02:11:17.730 --> 02:11:20.570
And great affectionswrestling in thy bosom

2202
02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:24.100
Doth make an earthquake ofnobility.

2203
02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:26.800
O, what a noble combathast thou fought

2204
02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:32.170
Between compulsion and abrave respect!

2205
02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:40.230
Let me wipe off thishonourable dew,

2206
02:11:40.230 --> 02:11:43.530
That silverly dothprogress on thy cheeks:

2207
02:11:43.530 --> 02:11:47.230
My heart hath melted at alady's tears,

2208
02:11:47.230 --> 02:11:48.600
Being an ordinaryinundation;

2209
02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:51.530
But this effusion of suchmanly drops,

2210
02:11:51.530 --> 02:11:56.730
This shower, blown up bytempest of the soul,

2211
02:11:56.730 --> 02:12:01.130
Startles mine eyes, andmakes me more amazed

2212
02:12:01.130 --> 02:12:02.930
Than had I seen the vaultytop of heaven

2213
02:12:02.930 --> 02:12:08.800
Figured quite o'er withburning meteors.

2214
02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:13.570
Lift up thy brow, renownedSalisbury,

2215
02:12:13.570 --> 02:12:16.870
And with a great heartheave away the storm:

2216
02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:19.930
Commend these waters tothose baby eyes

2217
02:12:19.930 --> 02:12:22.270
That never saw the giantworld enraged;

2218
02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:24.900
Nor met with fortune otherthan at feasts,

2219
02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:27.700
Full of warm blood, ofmirth, of gossiping.

2220
02:12:27.700 --> 02:12:34.200
Come, come; for thou shaltthrust thy hand as deep

2221
02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:37.370
Into the purse of richprosperity

2222
02:12:37.370 --> 02:12:43.070
As Lewis himself: so,nobles, shall you all,

2223
02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:47.570
That knit your sinews tothe strength of mine.

2224
02:12:47.570 --> 02:12:50.030
And even there, methinks,an angel spake:

2225
02:12:50.030 --> 02:12:54.130
(♪chanting)

2226
02:12:54.130 --> 02:12:56.370
Look, where the holylegate comes apace,

2227
02:12:56.370 --> 02:12:58.230
To give us warrant fromthe hand of heaven

2228
02:12:58.230 --> 02:13:00.470
And on our actions set thename of right

2229
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:02.230
With holy breath.

2230
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:08.400
Hail, noble prince ofFrance!

2231
02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:11.800
The next is this, KingJohn hath reconciled

2232
02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:15.430
Himself to Rome; hisspirit is come in,

2233
02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:18.700
That so stood out againstthe holy church,

2234
02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:21.470
The great metropolis andsee of Rome:

2235
02:13:21.470 --> 02:13:25.030
Therefore thy threateningcolours now wind up;

2236
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:29.200
And tame the savage spiritof wild war,

2237
02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:30.800
That like a lion foster'dup at hand,

2238
02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:34.200
It may lie gently at thefoot of peace,

2239
02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:37.730
And be no further harmfulthan in show.

2240
02:13:40.900 --> 02:13:44.500
Your grace shall pardonme, I will not back:

2241
02:13:47.770 --> 02:13:52.030
I am too high-born to bepropertied,

2242
02:13:52.030 --> 02:13:53.370
To be a secondary atcontrol,

2243
02:13:53.370 --> 02:13:55.400
Or useful serving-man andinstrument,

2244
02:13:55.400 --> 02:14:00.070
To any sovereign statethroughout the world.

2245
02:14:00.070 --> 02:14:03.400
Your breath first kindledthe dead coal of wars

2246
02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:05.830
Between this chastisedkingdom and myself,

2247
02:14:05.830 --> 02:14:09.230
And brought in matter thatshould feed this fire;

2248
02:14:09.230 --> 02:14:11.570
And now 'tis far too hugeto be blown out

2249
02:14:11.570 --> 02:14:13.130
With that same weak windwhich enkindled it.

2250
02:14:13.130 --> 02:14:18.970
You taught me how to knowthe face of right,

2251
02:14:18.970 --> 02:14:21.030
Acquainted me withinterest to this land,

2252
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:24.570
Yea, thrust thisenterprise into my heart;

2253
02:14:24.570 --> 02:14:26.200
And come ye now to tell meJohn hath made

2254
02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:31.430
His peace with Rome? Whatis that peace to me?

2255
02:14:32.730 --> 02:14:34.730
I, by the honour of mymarriage-bed,

2256
02:14:34.730 --> 02:14:36.730
After young Arthur, claimthis land for mine;

2257
02:14:36.730 --> 02:14:38.500
And, now it ishalf-conquer'd, must I back

2258
02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:41.100
Because that John hathmade his peace with Rome?

2259
02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:44.970
Am I Rome's slave? Whatpenny hath Rome borne,

2260
02:14:44.970 --> 02:14:46.670
What men provided, whatmunition sent,

2261
02:14:46.670 --> 02:14:48.800
To underprop this action?Is't not I

2262
02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:50.900
That undergo this charge?who else but I,

2263
02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:53.470
And such as to my claimare liable,

2264
02:14:53.470 --> 02:14:57.330
Sweat in this business andmaintain this war?

2265
02:14:57.330 --> 02:14:58.500
Have I not heard theseislanders shout out

2266
02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:01.870
'Vive le roi!' as I havebank'd their towns?

2267
02:15:01.870 --> 02:15:04.770
Have I not here the bestcards for the game,

2268
02:15:04.770 --> 02:15:08.000
To win this easy matchplay'd for a crown?

2269
02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:15.570
And shall I now give o'erthe yielded set?

2270
02:15:15.570 --> 02:15:20.200
No, no, on my soul, itnever shall be said.

2271
02:15:21.230 --> 02:15:24.200
You look but on theoutside of this work.

2272
02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:26.670
Outside or inside, I willnot return

2273
02:15:26.670 --> 02:15:28.330
Till my attempt so much beglorified

2274
02:15:28.330 --> 02:15:30.370
As to my ample hope waspromised

2275
02:15:30.370 --> 02:15:32.970
Before I drew this gallanthead of war,

2276
02:15:32.970 --> 02:15:36.000
And cull'd these fieryspirits from the world,

2277
02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:40.330
To outlook conquest and towin renown

2278
02:15:40.330 --> 02:15:43.330
Even in the jaws of dangerand of death.

2279
02:15:43.330 --> 02:15:45.700
(♪Trumpets)

2280
02:15:46.330 --> 02:15:49.400
What lusty trumpet thusdoth summon us?

2281
02:15:55.770 --> 02:15:56.970
According to the fair playof the world,

2282
02:15:56.970 --> 02:16:01.400
Let me have audience; I amsent to speak:

2283
02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:03.670
My holy lord of Milan,from the king

2284
02:16:03.670 --> 02:16:07.570
I come, to learn how youhave dealt for him;

2285
02:16:07.570 --> 02:16:09.100
And, as you answer, I doknow the scope

2286
02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:13.230
And warrant limited untomy tongue.

2287
02:16:16.100 --> 02:16:20.370
The Dauphin is toowilful-opposite,

2288
02:16:20.370 --> 02:16:24.870
And will not temporizewith my entreaties;

2289
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:29.870
He flatly says he'll notlay down his arms.

2290
02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:31.470
By all the blood that everfury breathed,

2291
02:16:31.470 --> 02:16:37.270
The youth says well. Nowhear our English king;

2292
02:16:37.270 --> 02:16:40.430
For thus his royalty dothspeak in me.

2293
02:16:40.430 --> 02:16:45.470
He is prepared, and reasontoo he should:

2294
02:16:45.470 --> 02:16:48.500
This apish and unmannerlyapproach,

2295
02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:51.470
This harness'd masque andunadvised revel,

2296
02:16:51.470 --> 02:16:53.870
This unhair'd saucinessand boyish troops,

2297
02:16:53.870 --> 02:16:56.770
The king doth smile at;and is well prepared

2298
02:16:56.770 --> 02:16:59.070
To whip this dwarfish war,these pigmy arms,

2299
02:16:59.070 --> 02:17:02.430
From out the circle of histerritories.

2300
02:17:03.470 --> 02:17:06.330
That hand which had thestrength, even at your door,

2301
02:17:06.330 --> 02:17:08.930
To cudgel you and make youtake the hatch,

2302
02:17:08.930 --> 02:17:12.100
To dive like buckets inconcealed wells,

2303
02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:15.370
To crouch in litter ofyour stable planks,

2304
02:17:15.370 --> 02:17:17.630
To lie like pawns lock'dup in chests and trunks,

2305
02:17:17.630 --> 02:17:20.700
To hug with swine, to seeksweet safety out

2306
02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:22.970
In vaults and prisons, andto thrill and shake

2307
02:17:22.970 --> 02:17:24.670
Even at the crying of yournation's crow,

2308
02:17:24.670 --> 02:17:26.530
Thinking his voice anarmed Englishman;

2309
02:17:26.530 --> 02:17:28.830
Shall that victorious handbe feebled here,

2310
02:17:28.830 --> 02:17:30.730
That in your chambers gaveyou chastisement?

2311
02:17:30.730 --> 02:17:35.030
No: know the gallantmonarch is in arms

2312
02:17:35.030 --> 02:17:37.300
And like an eagle o'er hisaery towers,

2313
02:17:37.300 --> 02:17:40.470
To souse annoyance thatcomes near his nest.

2314
02:17:40.470 --> 02:17:45.300
And you degenerate, youingrate revolts,

2315
02:17:45.300 --> 02:17:48.300
You bloody Neroes, rippingup the womb

2316
02:17:48.300 --> 02:17:51.800
Of your dear motherEngland, blush for shame;

2317
02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:53.630
For your own ladies andpale-visaged maids

2318
02:17:53.630 --> 02:17:56.130
Like Amazons come trippingafter drums,

2319
02:17:56.130 --> 02:17:58.200
Their thimbles into armedgauntlets change,

2320
02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:00.070
Their needles to lances,and their gentle hearts

2321
02:18:00.070 --> 02:18:02.900
To fierce and bloodyinclination.

2322
02:18:02.900 --> 02:18:07.070
There end thy brave, andturn thy face in peace;

2323
02:18:07.070 --> 02:18:11.270
We grant thou canst outscoldus: fare thee well;

2324
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:13.670
We hold our time tooprecious to be spent

2325
02:18:13.670 --> 02:18:15.200
With such a brabbler.

2326
02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:16.400
Give me leave to speak.

2327
02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:18.570
No, I will speak.

2328
02:18:18.570 --> 02:18:19.670
We will attend to neither.

2329
02:18:19.670 --> 02:18:21.900
Strike up the drums; andlet the tongue of war

2330
02:18:21.900 --> 02:18:24.870
Plead for our interest andour being here.

2331
02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:27.830
Indeed your drums, beingbeaten, will cry out;

2332
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:32.270
And so shall you, beingbeaten: do but start

2333
02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:33.700
An echo with the clamourof thy drum,

2334
02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:35.630
And even at hand a drum isready braced

2335
02:18:35.630 --> 02:18:38.200
That shall reverberate allas loud as thine;

2336
02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:39.800
Sound but another, andanother shall

2337
02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:41.630
As loud as thine rattlethe welkin's ear

2338
02:18:41.630 --> 02:18:43.470
And mock the deep-mouth'dthunder: for at hand,

2339
02:18:43.470 --> 02:18:47.200
Not trusting to thishalting legate here,

2340
02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:49.870
Whom he hath used ratherfor sport than need

2341
02:18:49.870 --> 02:18:52.400
Is warlike John; and inhis forehead sits

2342
02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:55.330
A bare-ribb'd death, whoseoffice is this day

2343
02:18:55.330 --> 02:18:59.030
To feast upon wholethousands of the French.

2344
02:18:59.030 --> 02:19:03.070
Strike up our drums, tofind this danger out.

2345
02:19:03.070 --> 02:19:06.300
And thou shalt find it,Dauphin, do not doubt.

2346
02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:11.970
(♪drums pound)

2347
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:17.130
How goes the day with us?O, tell me, Hubert.

2348
02:19:17.130 --> 02:19:20.800
Badly, I fear. How faresyour majesty?

2349
02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:24.130
This fever, that hathtroubled me so long,

2350
02:19:24.130 --> 02:19:28.330
Lies heavy on me; O, myheart is sick!

2351
02:19:28.330 --> 02:19:30.470
My lord, your valiantkinsman, Faulconbridge,

2352
02:19:30.470 --> 02:19:32.630
Desires your majesty toleave the field

2353
02:19:32.630 --> 02:19:34.930
And send him word by mewhich way you go.

2354
02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:40.030
Tell him, toward Swinstead,to the abbey there.

2355
02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:41.900
Be of good comfort; forthe great supply

2356
02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:43.730
That was expected by theDauphin here,

2357
02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:47.470
Are wreck'd three nightsago on Goodwin Sands.

2358
02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:49.900
This news was brought toRichard but even now:

2359
02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:55.800
The French fight coldly,and retire themselves.

2360
02:19:55.800 --> 02:19:58.570
Ay me! this tyrant feverburns me up,

2361
02:19:58.570 --> 02:20:00.630
And will not let mewelcome this good news.

2362
02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:09.000
Set on toward Swinstead:to my litter straight;

2363
02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:15.030
Weakness possesseth me,and I am faint.

2364
02:20:21.470 --> 02:20:25.330
I did not think the kingso stored with friends.

2365
02:20:25.330 --> 02:20:28.100
Up once again; put spiritin the French:

2366
02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:30.370
If they miscarry, wemiscarry too.

2367
02:20:30.370 --> 02:20:33.200
That misbegotten devil,Faulconbridge,

2368
02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:36.670
In spite of spite, aloneupholds the day.

2369
02:20:36.670 --> 02:20:38.830
They say King John soresick hath left the field.

2370
02:20:38.830 --> 02:20:40.800
Lead me to the revolts ofEngland here.

2371
02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:43.600
When we were happy we hadother names.

2372
02:20:43.600 --> 02:20:47.130
It is the Count Melun.

2373
02:20:47.130 --> 02:20:48.330
Wounded to death.

2374
02:20:48.330 --> 02:20:53.830
Fly, noble English, youare bought and sold;

2375
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:55.400
Unthread the rude eye ofrebellion

2376
02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:58.570
And welcome home againdiscarded faith.

2377
02:20:58.570 --> 02:21:01.030
Seek out King John andfall before his feet;

2378
02:21:01.030 --> 02:21:04.600
For if the French be lordsof this loud day,

2379
02:21:04.600 --> 02:21:07.670
He means to recompense thepains you take

2380
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:11.170
By cutting off your heads:thus hath he sworn

2381
02:21:11.170 --> 02:21:13.470
And I with him, and manymoe with me,

2382
02:21:13.470 --> 02:21:15.370
Upon the altar at SaintEdmundsbury;

2383
02:21:15.370 --> 02:21:17.800
Even on that altar wherewe swore to you

2384
02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:20.630
Dear amity and everlastinglove.

2385
02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:24.970
May this be possible? maythis be true?

2386
02:21:24.970 --> 02:21:28.270
Have I not hideous deathwithin my view,

2387
02:21:28.270 --> 02:21:32.000
Retaining but a quantityof life,

2388
02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.730
Which bleeds away, even asa form of wax

2389
02:21:34.730 --> 02:21:39.400
Resolveth from his figure'gainst the fire?

2390
02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:43.770
What in the world shouldmake me now deceive,

2391
02:21:43.770 --> 02:21:47.570
Since I must lose the useof all deceit?

2392
02:21:47.570 --> 02:21:50.500
Why should I then befalse, since it is true

2393
02:21:50.500 --> 02:21:56.170
That I must die here andlive hence by truth?

2394
02:21:56.170 --> 02:21:59.230
I say again, if Lewis dowin the day,

2395
02:21:59.230 --> 02:22:02.800
He is forsworn, if e'erthose eyes of yours

2396
02:22:02.800 --> 02:22:06.630
Behold another day breakin the east:

2397
02:22:09.500 --> 02:22:12.770
But even this night, whoseblack contagious breath

2398
02:22:12.770 --> 02:22:14.600
Already smokes about theburning crest

2399
02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:17.300
Of the old, feeble andday-wearied sun,

2400
02:22:17.300 --> 02:22:23.330
Even this ill night, yourbreathing shall expire,

2401
02:22:23.330 --> 02:22:26.230
Paying the fine of ratedtreachery

2402
02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:28.330
Even with a treacherousfine of all your lives,

2403
02:22:28.330 --> 02:22:34.000
If Lewis by yourassistance win the day.

2404
02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:39.630
Commend me to one Hubertwith your king:

2405
02:22:39.630 --> 02:22:41.170
The love of him, and thisrespect besides,

2406
02:22:41.170 --> 02:22:45.700
For that my grandsire wasan Englishman,

2407
02:22:45.700 --> 02:22:51.500
Awakes my conscience toconfess all this.

2408
02:22:51.500 --> 02:22:55.930
In lieu whereof, I prayyou, bear me hence

2409
02:22:55.930 --> 02:23:00.530
From forth the noise andrumour of the field,

2410
02:23:00.530 --> 02:23:03.270
Where I may think theremnant of my thoughts

2411
02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:08.570
In peace, and part thisbody and my soul

2412
02:23:08.570 --> 02:23:14.070
With contemplation anddevout desires.

2413
02:23:14.070 --> 02:23:17.900
We do believe thee: andbeshrew my soul

2414
02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:19.500
But I do love the favourand the form

2415
02:23:19.500 --> 02:23:22.530
Of this most fairoccasion, by the which

2416
02:23:22.530 --> 02:23:25.670
We will untread the stepsof damned flight,

2417
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:26.830
And like a bated andretired flood,

2418
02:23:26.830 --> 02:23:30.000
Leaving our rankness andirregular course,

2419
02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.830
Stoop low within thosebounds we have o'erlook'd

2420
02:23:32.830 --> 02:23:35.770
And cabby run on inobedience

2421
02:23:35.770 --> 02:23:39.700
Even to our ocean, to ourgreat King John.

2422
02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:43.470
My arm shall give theehelp to bear thee hence;

2423
02:23:43.470 --> 02:23:45.130
For I do see the cruelpangs of death

2424
02:23:45.130 --> 02:23:50.400
Right in thine eye. Away,my friends! New flight;

2425
02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:54.430
And happy newness, thatintends old right.

2426
02:23:55.800 --> 02:23:58.330
The sun of heaven methoughtwas loath to set,

2427
02:23:58.330 --> 02:24:00.830
But stay'd and made thewestern welkin blush,

2428
02:24:00.830 --> 02:24:02.800
When English measurebackward their own ground

2429
02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:06.330
In faint retire. O,bravely came we off,

2430
02:24:06.330 --> 02:24:08.370
When with a volley of ourneedless shot,

2431
02:24:08.370 --> 02:24:11.770
After such bloody toil, webid good night;

2432
02:24:11.770 --> 02:24:14.230
And wound our tatteringcolours clearly up,

2433
02:24:14.230 --> 02:24:17.870
Last in the field, andalmost lords of it!

2434
02:24:17.870 --> 02:24:19.830
Where is my prince, theDauphin?

2435
02:24:19.830 --> 02:24:21.470
Here: what news?

2436
02:24:21.470 --> 02:24:23.730
The Count Melun is slain;the English lords

2437
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:35.400
by his persuasion areagain fall'n off,

2438
02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:38.130
And your supply, whichyou have wish'd so long,

2439
02:24:38.130 --> 02:24:41.170
Are cast away and sunk onGoodwin Sands.

2440
02:24:46.730 --> 02:24:52.400
Ah, foul shrewd news!beshrew thy very heart!

2441
02:24:54.400 --> 02:24:56.970
I did not think to be sosad to-night

2442
02:24:56.970 --> 02:25:02.370
As this hath made me. Whowas he that said

2443
02:25:02.370 --> 02:25:04.870
King John did fly an houror two before

2444
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:07.300
The stumbling night didpart our weary powers?

2445
02:25:07.300 --> 02:25:10.070
Whoever spoke it, it istrue, my lord.

2446
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:15.330
Well; keep good quarterand good care to-night:

2447
02:25:15.330 --> 02:25:17.900
The day shall not be up sosoon as I,

2448
02:25:17.900 --> 02:25:20.400
To try the fair adventure ofto-morrow.

2449
02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:23.700
(♪horns)

2450
02:25:39.630 --> 02:25:42.670
Who's there? speak, ho!speak quickly, or I shoot.

2451
02:25:42.670 --> 02:25:44.070
A friend. What art thou?

2452
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:46.200
Of the part of England.

2453
02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:47.400
Whither dost thou go?

2454
02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:49.670
What's that to thee? whymay not I demand

2455
02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:51.700
Of thine affairs, as wellas thou of mine?

2456
02:25:51.700 --> 02:25:54.270
Hubert, I think?

2457
02:25:54.270 --> 02:25:56.370
Thou hast a perfectthought:

2458
02:25:56.370 --> 02:25:57.900
I will upon all hazardswell believe

2459
02:25:57.900 --> 02:26:00.370
Thou art my friend, thatknow'st my tongue so well.

2460
02:26:00.370 --> 02:26:01.800
Who art thou?

2461
02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:04.130
Who thou wilt: and if thouplease,

2462
02:26:04.130 --> 02:26:06.000
Thou mayst befriend me somuch as to think

2463
02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:09.370
I come one way of thePlantagenets.

2464
02:26:09.370 --> 02:26:13.330
Unkind remembrance! thouand eyeless night

2465
02:26:13.330 --> 02:26:15.970
Have done me shame: bravesoldier, pardon me,

2466
02:26:15.970 --> 02:26:17.830
That any accent breakingfrom thy tongue

2467
02:26:17.830 --> 02:26:19.830
Should 'scape the trueacquaintance of mine ear.

2468
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:22.730
Come, come; sans compliment,what news abroad?

2469
02:26:22.730 --> 02:26:24.730
Why, here walk I in theblack brow of night,

2470
02:26:24.730 --> 02:26:27.770
To find you out.

2471
02:26:27.770 --> 02:26:29.600
Brief, then; and what'sthe news?

2472
02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:32.100
O, my sweet sir, newsfitting to the night,

2473
02:26:32.100 --> 02:26:36.630
Black, fearful,comfortless and horrible.

2474
02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:37.900
Show me the very wound ofthis ill news:

2475
02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:39.970
I am no woman, I'll notswoon at it.

2476
02:26:39.970 --> 02:26:43.900
The king, I fear, ispoison'd by a monk:

2477
02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:46.800
I left him almostspeechless; and broke out

2478
02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:48.230
To acquaint you with thisevil, that you might

2479
02:26:48.230 --> 02:26:49.770
The better arm you to thesudden time,

2480
02:26:49.770 --> 02:26:53.330
Than if you had at leisureknown of this.

2481
02:26:53.330 --> 02:26:55.700
How did he take it? whodid taste to him?

2482
02:26:55.700 --> 02:26:59.330
A monk, I tell you; aresolved villain,

2483
02:26:59.330 --> 02:27:02.400
Whose bowels suddenlyburst out: the king

2484
02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:06.370
Yet speaks andperadventure may recover.

2485
02:27:06.770 --> 02:27:09.470
Who didst thou leave totend his majesty?

2486
02:27:09.470 --> 02:27:14.300
Why, know you not? thelords are all come back,

2487
02:27:14.300 --> 02:27:16.200
And brought Prince Henryin their company;

2488
02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:18.570
At whose request the kinghath pardon'd them,

2489
02:27:18.570 --> 02:27:22.170
And they are all about hismajesty.

2490
02:27:22.170 --> 02:27:28.500
Withhold thine indignation,mighty heaven,

2491
02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:32.370
And tempt us not to bearabove our power!

2492
02:27:32.370 --> 02:27:35.930
I'll tell tree, Hubert,half my power this night,

2493
02:27:35.930 --> 02:27:39.970
Passing these flats, aretaken by the tide;

2494
02:27:39.970 --> 02:27:43.000
These Lincoln Washes havedevoured them;

2495
02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:48.800
Myself, well mounted,hardly have escaped.

2496
02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:50.770
Away before: conduct me tothe king;

2497
02:27:50.770 --> 02:27:53.770
I doubt he will be dead orere I come.

2498
02:27:57.930 --> 02:28:08.030
(♪ bells and chanting

2499
02:28:08.030 --> 02:28:16.370
(♪ bells and chanting

2500
02:28:16.370 --> 02:28:19.270
It is too late: the lifeof all his blood

2501
02:28:19.270 --> 02:28:23.770
Is touch'd corruptibly,and his pure brain,

2502
02:28:23.770 --> 02:28:26.370
Which some suppose thesoul's frail dwelling-house,

2503
02:28:26.370 --> 02:28:28.700
Doth by the idle commentsthat it makes

2504
02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:31.300
Foretell the ending ofmortality.

2505
02:28:31.300 --> 02:28:33.930
His highness yet dothspeak, and holds belief

2506
02:28:33.930 --> 02:28:34.900
That, being brought intothe open air,

2507
02:28:34.900 --> 02:28:37.070
It would allay the burningquality

2508
02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:41.470
Of that fell poison whichassaileth him.

2509
02:28:41.470 --> 02:28:45.130
Let him be brought intothe orchard here.

2510
02:28:46.430 --> 02:28:47.870
Doth he still rage?

2511
02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:50.170
He is more patient

2512
02:28:50.170 --> 02:28:54.000
Than when you left him;even now he sung.

2513
02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.530
O vanity of sickness!fierce extremes

2514
02:28:55.530 --> 02:29:00.400
In their continuance willnot feel themselves.

2515
02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:02.530
Death, having prey'd uponthe outward parts,

2516
02:29:02.530 --> 02:29:06.070
Leaves them invisible, andhis siege is now

2517
02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:10.400
Against the mind, thewhich he pricks and wounds

2518
02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:13.000
With many legions ofstrange fantasies,

2519
02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:16.930
Which, in their throng andpress to that last hold,

2520
02:29:16.930 --> 02:29:22.670
Confound themselves. 'Tisstrange that death

2521
02:29:22.670 --> 02:29:24.470
should sing.

2522
02:29:24.470 --> 02:29:27.330
I am the cygnet to thispale faint swan,

2523
02:29:27.330 --> 02:29:30.430
Who chants a doleful hymnto his own death,

2524
02:29:30.430 --> 02:29:33.030
And from the organ-pipe offrailty sings

2525
02:29:33.030 --> 02:29:36.000
His soul and body to theirlasting rest.

2526
02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.470
Be of good comfort,prince; for you are born

2527
02:29:38.470 --> 02:29:40.500
To set a form upon thatindigest

2528
02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:44.430
Which he hath left soshapeless and so rude.

2529

(♪chanting)

2530
02:29:53.330 --> 02:29:58.670
Ay, marry, now my soulhath elbow-room;

2531
02:29:58.670 --> 02:30:04.400
It would not out atwindows nor at doors.

2532
02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:08.800
There is so hot a summerin my bosom,

2533
02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:12.830
That all my bowels crumbleup to dust:

2534
02:30:12.830 --> 02:30:18.100
I am a scribbled form,drawn with a pen

2535
02:30:18.100 --> 02:30:24.270
Upon a parchment, andagainst this fire

2536
02:30:24.270 --> 02:30:26.100
Do I shrink up.

2537
02:30:26.100 --> 02:30:29.470
How fares your majesty?

2538
02:30:29.670 --> 02:30:38.930
Poison'd,--ill fare--dead,forsook, cast off:

2539
02:30:38.930 --> 02:30:41.730
And none of you will bidthe winter come

2540
02:30:41.730 --> 02:30:45.900
To thrust his icy fingersin my maw,

2541
02:30:45.900 --> 02:30:49.400
Nor let my kingdom'srivers take their course

2542
02:30:49.400 --> 02:30:53.430
Through my burn'd bosom,nor entreat the north

2543
02:30:53.430 --> 02:30:58.370
To make his bleak windskiss my parched lips

2544
02:30:58.370 --> 02:31:03.430
And comfort me with cold.I do not ask you much,

2545
02:31:03.430 --> 02:31:09.400
I beg cold comfort; andyou are so strait

2546
02:31:09.400 --> 02:31:12.300
And so ingrateful, youdeny me that.

2547
02:31:12.300 --> 02:31:14.030
O that there were somevirtue in my tears,

2548
02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:16.230
That might relieve you!

2549
02:31:16.230 --> 02:31:21.500
The salt in them is hot.

2550
02:31:21.500 --> 02:31:28.070
Within me is a hell; andthere the poison

2551
02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:31.930
Is as a fiend confined totyrannize

2552
02:31:31.930 --> 02:31:37.370
On unreprievable condemnedblood.

2553
02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:41.030
O, I am scalded with myviolent motion,

2554
02:31:41.030 --> 02:31:44.000
And spleen of speed to seeyour majesty!

2555
02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:50.200
O cousin, thou art come toset mine eye:

2556
02:31:50.200 --> 02:31:57.600
The tackle of my heart iscrack'd and burn'd,

2557
02:31:57.600 --> 02:32:01.970
And all the shrouds wherewithmy life should sail

2558
02:32:01.970 --> 02:32:08.130
Are turned to one hair,one little thread:

2559
02:32:08.130 --> 02:32:13.730
My heart hath one poorstring to stay it by,

2560
02:32:13.730 --> 02:32:18.100
Which holds but till thynews be uttered;

2561
02:32:18.100 --> 02:32:22.930
And then all this thouseest is but a clod

2562
02:32:22.930 --> 02:32:27.970
And module of confoundedroyalty.

2563
02:32:27.970 --> 02:32:30.300
The Dauphin is preparinghitherward,

2564
02:32:30.300 --> 02:32:33.100
Where God He knows howwe shall answer him;

2565
02:32:33.100 --> 02:32:34.930
For in a night the bestpart of my power,

2566
02:32:34.930 --> 02:32:36.600
As I upon advantage didremove,

2567
02:32:36.600 --> 02:32:37.970
Were in the Washes allunwarily

2568
02:32:37.970 --> 02:32:40.270
Devoured by the unexpectedflood.

2569
02:32:47.230 --> 02:32:52.230
You breathe these deadnews in as dead an ear.

2570
02:32:52.230 --> 02:32:58.570
My liege! my lord! but nowa king, now thus.

2571
02:32:58.570 --> 02:33:05.130
Even so must I run on, andeven so stop.

2572
02:33:05.770 --> 02:33:10.570
What surety of the world,what hope, what stay,

2573
02:33:10.570 --> 02:33:15.770
When this was now a king,and now is clay?

2574
02:33:17.530 --> 02:33:22.030
Art thou gone so? I do butstay behind

2575
02:33:22.030 --> 02:33:23.970
To do the office for theeof revenge,

2576
02:33:23.970 --> 02:33:27.230
And then my soul shallwait on thee to heaven,

2577
02:33:27.230 --> 02:33:31.200
As it on earth hath beenthy servant still.

2578
02:33:36.900 --> 02:33:40.970
Now, now, you stars thatmove in your right spheres,

2579
02:33:40.970 --> 02:33:43.130
Where be your powers? shownow your mended faiths,

2580
02:33:43.130 --> 02:33:44.830
And instantly return withme again,

2581
02:33:44.830 --> 02:33:46.900
To push destruction andperpetual shame

2582
02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:48.470
Out of the weak door ofour fainting land.

2583
02:33:48.470 --> 02:33:51.030
Straight let us seek, orstraight we shall be sought;

2584
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:52.700
The Dauphin rages at ourvery heels.

2585
02:33:52.700 --> 02:33:55.600
It seems you know not,then, so much as we:

2586
02:33:55.600 --> 02:33:58.270
The Cardinal Pandulph iswithin at rest,

2587
02:33:58.270 --> 02:33:59.570
Who half an hour sincecame from the Dauphin,

2588
02:33:59.570 --> 02:34:03.500
And brings from him suchoffers of our peace

2589
02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:05.630
As we with honour andrespect may take,

2590
02:34:05.630 --> 02:34:08.630
With purpose presently toleave this war.

2591
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:10.130
He will the rather do itwhen he sees

2592
02:34:10.130 --> 02:34:11.700
Ourselves well sinewed toour defence.

2593
02:34:11.700 --> 02:34:14.030
Nay, it is in a mannerdone already;

2594
02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:15.500
For many carriages he hathdispatch'd

2595
02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:17.530
To the sea-side, and puthis cause and quarrel

2596
02:34:17.530 --> 02:34:19.730
To the disposing of thecardinal:

2597
02:34:19.730 --> 02:34:22.400
With whom yourself, myselfand other lords,

2598
02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:25.070
If you think meet, thisafternoon will post

2599
02:34:25.070 --> 02:34:31.130
To consummate thisbusiness happily.

2600
02:34:31.130 --> 02:34:37.130
Let it be so: and you, mynoble prince,

2601
02:34:37.130 --> 02:34:38.900
With other princes thatmay best be spared,

2602
02:34:38.900 --> 02:34:42.170
Shall wait upon yourfather's funeral.

2603
02:34:42.170 --> 02:34:45.530
At Worcester must his bodybe interr'd;

2604
02:34:45.530 --> 02:34:47.770
For so he will'd it.

2605
02:34:47.770 --> 02:34:49.730
Thither shall it then:

2606
02:34:49.730 --> 02:34:51.730
And happily may your sweetself put on

2607
02:34:51.730 --> 02:34:55.270
The lineal state and gloryof the land!

2608
02:34:55.270 --> 02:34:58.970
To whom with allsubmission, on my knee

2609
02:34:58.970 --> 02:35:01.230
I do bequeath my faithfulservices

2610
02:35:01.230 --> 02:35:04.630
And true subjectioneverlastingly.

2611
02:35:04.630 --> 02:35:06.530
And the like tender of ourlove we make,

2612
02:35:06.530 --> 02:35:09.930
To rest without a spot forevermore.

2613
02:35:09.930 --> 02:35:12.230
I have a kind soul thatwould give you thanks

2614
02:35:12.230 --> 02:35:15.000
And knows not how to do itbut with tears.

2615
02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:18.300
O, let us pay the time butneedful woe,

2616
02:35:18.300 --> 02:35:21.570
Since it hath beenbeforehand with our griefs.

2617
02:35:21.570 --> 02:35:25.230
This England never did,nor never shall,

2618
02:35:25.230 --> 02:35:27.900
Lie at the proud foot of aconqueror,

2619
02:35:27.900 --> 02:35:31.100
But when it first did helpto wound itself.

2620
02:35:31.100 --> 02:35:33.370
Now these her princes arecome home again,

2621
02:35:33.370 --> 02:35:34.970
Come the three corners ofthe world in arms,

2622
02:35:34.970 --> 02:35:37.930
And we shall shock them.Nought shall make us rue,

2623
02:35:37.930 --> 02:35:42.530
If England to itself dorest but true.

2624
02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:02.370
(♪chanting)

2625
02:38:06.570 --> 02:38:07.570


2626
02:38:08.730 --> 02:38:11.730
