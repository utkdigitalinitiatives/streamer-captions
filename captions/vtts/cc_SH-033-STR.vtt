00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100


2
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.000


3
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.300
Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?

4
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.530
Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France

5
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.070
In my behavior to the majesty,

6
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.400
The borrow'd majesty, of England here.

7
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.600
A strange beginning: 'borrow'd majesty!'

8
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.330
Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.

9
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.370
Philip of France, in right and true behalf

10
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.000
Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,

11
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.800
Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim

12
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.100
To this fair island and the territories,

13
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.830
To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,

14
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.070
Desiring thee to lay aside the sword

15
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.270
Which sways usurpingly these several titles,

16
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.670
And put these same into young Arthur's hand,

17
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.800
Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.

18
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.600
What follows if we disallow of this?

19
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.700
The proud control of fierce and bloody war,

20
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.470
To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.

21
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.470
Here have we war for war and blood for blood,

22
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.270
Controlment for controlment: so answer France.

23
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.100
Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,

24
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.470
The farthest limit of my embassy.

25
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.700
Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:

26
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.830
Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;

27
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.100
For ere thou canst report I will be there,

28
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.300
The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:

29
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.470
So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath

30
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.030
And sullen presage of your own decay.

31
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.530
An honourable conduct let him have:

32
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.100
Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon.

33
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.200
What now, my son! have I not ever said

34
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.370
How that ambitious Constance would not cease

35
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.030
Till she had kindled France and all the world,

36
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.570
Upon the right and party of her son?

37
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.600
This might have been prevented and made whole

38
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.470
With very easy arguments of love,

39
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.130
Which now the manage of two kingdoms must

40
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.430
With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.

41
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.530
Our strong possession and our right for us.

42
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.200
Your strong possession much more than your right,

43
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.330
Or else it must go wrong with you and me:

44
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.070
So much my conscience whispers in your ear,

45
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.770
Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.

46
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.430
My liege, here is the strangest controversy

47
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.930
Come from country to be judged by you,

48
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.800
That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?

49
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.030
Let them approach.

50
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.130
Our abbeys and our priories shall pay

51
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.400
This expedition's charge.

52
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.330
What men are you?

53
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.130
Your faithful subject I, a gentleman

54
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.270
Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,

55
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.430
As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,

56
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.700
A soldier, by the honour-giving hand

57
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.670
Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.

58
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.700
What art thou?

59
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.500
The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.

60
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.070
Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?

61
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.370
You came not of one mother then, it seems.

62
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.430
Most certain of one mother, mighty king;

63
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.170
That is well known; and, as I think, one father:

64
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.530
But for the certain knowledge of that truth

65
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.700
I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:

66
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.530
Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.

67
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.270
Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother

68
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.230
And wound her honour with this diffidence.

69
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.270
I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;

70
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.700
That is my brother's plea and none of mine;

71
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.700
The which if he can prove, a' pops me out

72
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.700
At least from fair five hundred pound a year:

73
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.930
Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!

74
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.600
A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,

75
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.400
Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?

76
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.930
I know not why, except to get the land.

77
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.430
But once he slander'd me with bastardy:

78
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.930
But whether I be as true begot or no,

79
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.270
That still I lay upon my mother's head,

80
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.830
But that I am as well begot, my liege,--

81
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.500
Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--

82
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.170
Compare our faces and be judge yourself.

83
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.000
If old sir Robert did beget us both

84
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.500
And were our father and this son like him,

85
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.800
O old sir Robert, father, on my knee

86
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.230
I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!

87
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.100
Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!

88
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.400
He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;

89
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.900
The accent of his tongue affecteth him.

90
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.900
Do you not read some tokens of my son

91
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.370
In the large composition of this man?

92
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.400
Mine eye hath well examined his parts

93
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.600
And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,

94
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.730
What doth move you to claim your brother's land?

95
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.770
Because he hath a half-face, like my father.

96
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.070
With half that face would he have all my land:

97
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.370
A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!

98
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.770
My gracious liege, when that my father lived,

99
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.400
Your brother did employ my father much,--

100
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.900
Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:

101
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.400
Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.

102
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.030
And once dispatch'd him in an embassy

103
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.730
To Germany, there with the emperor

104
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.370
To treat of high affairs touching that time.

105
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.330
The advantage of his absence took the king

106
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.030
And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;

107
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.470
Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,

108
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.600
But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores

109
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.070
Between my father and my mother lay,

110
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.000
As I have heard my father speak himself,

111
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.770
When this same lusty gentleman was got.

112
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.870
Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd

113
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.970
His lands to me, and took it on his death

114
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.900
That this my mother's son was none of his;

115
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.470
And if he were, he came into the world

116
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.070
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.

117
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.800
Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,

118
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.970
My father's land, as was my father's will.

119
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.100
Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;

120
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.170
Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,

121
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.230
And if she did play false, the fault was hers;

122
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.230
Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands

123
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.930
That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,

124
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.770
Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,

125
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.970
Had of your father claim'd this son for his?

126
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.070
In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept

127
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.900
This calf bred from his cow from all the world;

128
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.830
In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,

129
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.800
My brother might not claim him; nor your father,

130
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.070
Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;

131
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.300
My mother's son did get your father's heir;

132
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.600
Your father's heir must have your father's land.

133
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.670
Shall then my father's will be of no force

134
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.200
To dispossess that child which is not his?

135
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.600
Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,

136
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.570
Than was his will to get me, as I think.

137
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.600
Sirrah, whether thou hadst rather be a Faulconbridge

138
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.670
And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,

139
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.070
Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,

140
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.270
Lord of thy presence and no land beside?

141
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.070
Madam, an if my brother had my shape,

142
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.770
And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him;

143
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.600
And if my legs were two such riding-rods,

144
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.170
My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin

145
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.870
That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose

146
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.070
Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'

147
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.530
And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,

148
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.670
Would I might never stir from off this place,

149
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.970
I would give it every foot to have this face;

150
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.270
I would not be sir Nob in any case.

151
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.000
I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,

152
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.570
Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?

153
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:50.230
I am a soldier and now bound to France.

154
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:55.370
Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.

155
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.100
Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,

156
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.300
Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.

157
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.400
Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.

158
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.570
Nay, I would have you go before me thither.

159
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.900
Our country manners give our betters way.

160
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.330
What is thy name?

161
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.530
Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,

162
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:18.530
Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.

163
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.270
From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st:

164
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.470
Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,

165
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:31.170
Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.

166
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.830
Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:

167
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.970
My father gave me honour, yours gave land.

168
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.170
Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,

169
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.430
When I was got, sir Robert was away!

170
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.500
The very spirit of Plantagenet!

171
00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.900
I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.

172
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.500
Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?

173
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.570
Something about, a little from the right,

174
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.870
In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:

175
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.430
Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,

176
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.500
And have is have, however men do catch:

177
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.630
Near or far off, well won is still well shot,

178
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:21.300
And I am I, howe'er I was begot.

179
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.030
Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;

180
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.970
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.

181
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:31.430
Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed

182
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.530
For France, for France, for it is more than need.

183
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:46.270
Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!

184
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.870
For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.

185
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.030
A foot of honour better than I was;

186
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:05.470
But many a many foot of land the worse.

187
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.670
Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.

188
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.370
'Good den, sir Richard!' 'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--

189
00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.530
And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;

190
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.230
For new-made honour doth forget men's names;

191
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.670
'Tis too respective and too sociable

192
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.130
For your conversion. Now your traveller,

193
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.700
He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,

194
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.270
And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,

195
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.970
Why then I suck my teeth and catechise

196
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.470
My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'

197
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.700
Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,

198
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.700
'I shall beseech you'--that is question now;

199
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.430
And then comes answer like an Absey book:

200
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.270
'O sir, at your best command' says answer;

201
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.200
At your service; at your employment sir;

202
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.870
'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'

203
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.130
And so, ere answer knows what question would,

204
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.230
Saving in dialogue of compliment,

205
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.830
And talking of the Alps and Apennines,

206
00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.570
The Pyrenean and the river Po,

207
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:07.600
It draws toward supper in conclusion so.

208
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:13.370
But this is worshipful society

209
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.600
And fits the mounting spirit like myself,

210
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.000
For he is but a bastard to the time

211
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.300
That doth not smack of observation;

212
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.370
And so am I, whether I smack or no;

213
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.030
And not alone in habit and device,

214
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.070
Exterior form, outward accoutrement,

215
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:29.670
But from the inward motion to deliver

216
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.800
Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:

217
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.770
Which, though I will not practise to deceive,

218
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:41.870
Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;

219
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:47.170
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.

220
00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:50.770
But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?

221
00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.230
What woman-post is this? hath she no husband

222
00:11:54.230 --> 00:12:00.070
That will take pains to blow a horn before her?

223
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:08.070
O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!

224
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.330
What brings you here to court so hastily?

225
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.730
Where is that slave, thy brother? where is he,

226
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.930
That holds in chase mine honour up and down?

227
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.830
My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?

228
00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:20.900
Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?

229
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.630
Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?

230
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.870
Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,

231
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.630
Sir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?

232
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:32.030
He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou.

233
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.400
James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?

234
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.530
Good leave, good Philip.

235
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.600
(laughs) Sparrow: James,

236
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.930
There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.

237
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.530
Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:

238
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.930
Sir Robert might have eat his part in me

239
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:54.630
Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:

240
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.230
Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,

241
00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:01.370
Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:

242
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.300
We know his handiwork: then, good my mother,

243
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.270
To whom am I beholding for these limbs?

244
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.170
Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.

245
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.300
Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,

246
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.800
That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?

247
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.570
What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?

248
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:25.400
Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.

249
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.870
What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.

250
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:35.430
(laughing) But, madam, I was not old sir Robert's son;

251
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.500
I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;

252
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.600
Legitimation, name and all is gone:

253
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.330
Then, good my mother, let me know my father;

254
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:51.730
Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?

255
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.900
Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?

256
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.330
As faithfully as I deny the devil.

257
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:08.430
King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:

258
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:13.100
By long and vehement suit I was seduced

259
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.100
To make room for him in my husband's bed:

260
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.400
Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!

261
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.800
Thou art the issue of my dear offence,

262
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.470
Which was so strongly urged past my defence.

263
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.830
Now, by this light, were I to get again,

264
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.870
Madam, I would not wish a better father.

265
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.530
Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,

266
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:45.000
And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:

267
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.770
Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,

268
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.000
Subjected tribute to commanding love,

269
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.430
Against whose fury and unmatched force

270
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.000
The aweless lion could not wage the fight,

271
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.530
Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.

272
00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.730
He that perforce robs lions of their hearts

273
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:05.000
May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,

274
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.070
With all my heart I thank thee for my father!

275
00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.470
Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well

276
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.470
When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.

277
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:20.670
Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;

278
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.270
And they shall say, when Richard me begot,

279
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:27.870
If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:

280
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:34.230
Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not.

281
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:51.670
Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.

282
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:56.400
Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,

283
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.730
Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart

284
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.430
And fought the holy wars in Palestine,

285
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.470
By this brave duke came early to his grave:

286
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:07.930
And for amends to his posterity,

287
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.970
At our importance hither is he come,

288
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.900
To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,

289
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.830
And to rebuke the usurpation

290
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:20.970
Of thy unnatural uncle, English John:

291
00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:25.830
Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.

292
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.230
God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death

293
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.270
The rather that you give his offspring life,

294
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.330
Shadowing their right under your wings of war:

295
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.730
I give you welcome with a powerless hand,

296
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.600
But with a heart full of unstained love:

297
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.670
Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.

298
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.900
A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?

299
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.030
Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,

300
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.900
As seal to this indenture of my love,

301
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.800
That to my home I will no more return,

302
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.230
Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,

303
00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:02.130
Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,

304
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:05.700
Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides

305
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.400
And coops from other lands her islanders,

306
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.770
Even till that England, hedged in with the main,

307
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:14.670
That water-walled bulwark, still secure

308
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.600
And confident from foreign purposes,

309
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.730
Even till that utmost corner of the west

310
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.530
Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,

311
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:27.670
Will I not think of home, but follow arms.

312
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:32.070
O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,

313
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.330
Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength

314
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.100
To make a more requital to your love!

315
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.770
The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords

316
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:44.030
In such a just and charitable war.

317
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:49.330
(crowd chants) Arthur! Arthur!

318
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.570
Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent

319
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.770
Against the brows of this resisting town.

320
00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:55.270
Call for our chiefest men of discipline,

321
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.400
To cull the plots of best advantages:

322
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.930
We'll lay before this town our royal bones,

323
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.800
Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,

324
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.130
But we will make it subject to this boy.

325
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.170
Stay for an answer to your embassy,

326
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.670
Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:

327
00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.530
My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,

328
00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.270
That right in peace which here we urge in war,

329
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:15.970
And then we shall repent each drop of blood

330
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.000
Which hot rash haste so indirectly shed.

331
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.830
A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,

332
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:26.400
Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!

333
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.000
What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;

334
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon, speak.

335
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.670
Then turn your forces from this paltry siege

336
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.570
And stir them up against a mightier task.

337
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.970
England, impatient of your just demands,

338
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.530
Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,

339
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.600
Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time

340
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.130
To land his legions all as soon as I;

341
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.230
His marches are expedient to this town,

342
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.000
His forces strong, his soldiers confident.

343
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.270
With him along is come the mother-queen,

344
00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.370
An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;

345
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.370
With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;

346
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.630
With them a bastard of the king's deceased,

347
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.830
And all the unsettled humours of the land,

348
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.670
Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,

349
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.500
With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,

350
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.670
Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,

351
00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.900
Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,

352
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.670
To make hazard of new fortunes here:

353
00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.330
In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits

354
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.570
Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er

355
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.200
Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,

356
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.130
To do offence and scath in Christendom.

357
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:32.000
♪Drum beats

358
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.470
The interruption of their churlish drums

359
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.300
Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,

360
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.630
To parley or to fight; therefore prepare.

361
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:41.570
How much unlook'd for is this expedition!

362
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.270
By how much unexpected, by so much

363
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.870
We must awake endavour for defence;

364
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.830
For courage mounteth with occasion:

365
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:52.200
Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.

366
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.230
Peace be to France, if France in peace permit

367
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.030
Our just and lineal entrance to our own;

368
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:14.200
If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,

369
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.330
Whiles we, God's wrathful agent,

370
00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:21.800
do correct their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven.

371
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.630
Peace be to England, if that war return

372
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:36.730
From France to England, there to live in peace.

373
00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:41.930
England we love; and for that England's sake

374
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.770
With burden of our armour here we sweat.

375
00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.530
This toil of ours should be a work of thine;

376
00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:52.470
But thou from loving England art so far,

377
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.670
That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king

378
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.800
Cut off the sequence of posterity,

379
00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.430
Out-faced infant state and done a rape

380
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.670
Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.

381
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.500
Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face;

382
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.070
These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:

383
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:13.230
This little abstract doth contain that large

384
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:18.500
Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time

385
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:23.570
Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.

386
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:28.030
That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,

387
00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:32.000
And this his son; England was Geffrey's right

388
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.870
And this is Geffrey's: in the name of God

389
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:40.430
How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,

390
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:44.270
When living blood doth in these temples beat,

391
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:47.870
Which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest?

392
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.170
From whom hast thou this great commission, France,

393
00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.800
To draw my answer from thy articles?

394
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.300
From that supernal judge, which stirs good thoughts

395
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.170
In any breast of strong authority,

396
00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:03.230
To look into the blots and stains of right:

397
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:07.530
That judge hath made me guardian to this boy:

398
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.670
By whose warrant I impeach thy wrong

399
00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:15.170
And by whose help I mean to chastise it.

400
00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.170
Alack, thou dost usurp authority.

401
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:20.070
Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.

402
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.070
Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?

403
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:28.900
Let me make answer; thy usurping son.

404
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:33.030
Out, insolent! thy bastard shall be king,

405
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:36.930
That thou mayst be a queen, and cheque the world!

406
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:38.200
My bed was ever to thy son

407
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.300
as true as thine was to thy husband;

408
00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.400
and this boy liker in feature to his father Geffrey

409
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.570
Than thou and John in manners; being as like

410
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:49.600
As rain to water, or devil to his dam.

411
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.130
My boy a bastard! By my soul,

412
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.400
I think his father never was so true begot:

413
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.630
It cannot be, an if thou wert his mother.

414
00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.270
There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.

415
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.070
There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.

416
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.730
Peace!

417
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.470
Hear the crier.

418
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.630
What the devil art thou?

419
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.570
One that will play the devil, sir, with you,

420
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.000
An a' may catch your hide and you alone:

421
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.430
You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,

422
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:20.270
Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard;

423
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.330
I'll smoke your skin-coat, an I catch you right;

424
00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:25.900
Look to't Sirrah; i' faith, I will, i' faith.

425
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.230
O, well did he become that lion's robe

426
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.770
That did disrobe the lion of that robe!

427
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.130
It lies as sightly on the back of him

428
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:35.970
As great Alcides' shows upon an ass:

429
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.070
But, ass, I'll take that burthen from your back,

430
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:41.200
Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.

431
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.270
What craker is this same that deafs our ears

432
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:48.600
With this abundance of superfluous breath?

433
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.930
Lewis, determine what we shall do straight.

434
00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:54.970
Women and fools, break off your conference.

435
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:02.930
King John, this is the very sum of all;

436
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.600
England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,

437
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.530
In right of Arthur do I claim of thee:

438
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.430
Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?

439
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.600
My life as soon: I do defy thee, France.

440
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.200
Arthur of Bretagne, yield thee to my hand;

441
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.130
And out of my dear love I'll give thee more

442
00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:24.200
Than e'er the coward hand of France can win:

443
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.600
Submit thee, boy.

444
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.500
Come to thy grandam, child.

445
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.000
Do, child, go to it grandam, child:

446
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.670
Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will

447
00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:38.000
Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:

448
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.700
There's a good grandam.

449
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.000
Good my mother, peace!

450
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.830
I would that I were low laid in my grave:

451
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.130
I am not worth this coil that's made for me.

452
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.530
His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.

453
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.500
Now shame upon you, whether she does or no!

454
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.130
His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,

455
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:58.930
Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,

456
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.300
Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;

457
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.330
Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed

458
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:09.030
To do him justice and revenge on you.

459
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.900
Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!

460
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:18.730
Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth!

461
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:24.130
Call not me slanderer; thou and thine usurp the dominations,

462
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:29.030
royalties and rights of this oppressed boy:

463
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:33.270
this is thy eld'st son's son,

464
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.100
Infortunate in nothing but in thee:

465
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.370
Thy sins are visited in this poor child;

466
00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.630
The canon of the law is laid on him,

467
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.630
Being but the second generation

468
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.230
Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.

469
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.630
Bedlam, have done.

470
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.730
I have but this to say,

471
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.270
That he is not only plagued for her sin,

472
00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:55.670
But God hath made her sin and her the plague

473
00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:59.000
On this removed issue, plague for her

474
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.670
And with her plague; her sin his injury,

475
00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:04.670
Her injury the beadle to her sin,

476
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:08.070
All punish'd in the person of this child,

477
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:11.430
And all for her; a plague upon her!

478
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:15.770
Thou unadvised scold, I can produce a will

479
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:19.030
that bars the title of thy son.

480
00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:24.470
Ay, who doubts that? a will! a wicked will:

481
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:28.030
A woman's will; a canker'd grandam's will!

482
00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.500
Peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate:

483
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.730
It ill beseems this presence

484
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.570
to cry aim to these ill-tuned repetitions.

485
00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:36.270
Some trumpet summon hither to the walls

486
00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:40.100
These men of Angiers: let us hear them speak

487
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:44.200
Whose title they admit, Arthur's or John's.

488
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.230
♪Trumpet sounds.

489
00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.530
Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?

490
00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:54.100
'Tis France, for England.

491
00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.200
England, for itself.

492
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.670
You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects--

493
00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:02.530
You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,

494
00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:04.370
Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle--

495
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:12.070
For our advantage; therefore hear us first.

496
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.530
These flags of France, that are advanced here

497
00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.730
Before the eye and prospect of your town,

498
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.800
Have hither march'd to your endamagement:

499
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.930
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,

500
00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:24.730
And ready mounted are they to spit forth

501
00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:27.200
Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:

502
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.230
All preparation for a bloody siege

503
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:33.070
All merciless proceeding by these French

504
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.230
Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;

505
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:40.670
And but for our approach those sleeping stones,

506
00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.070
That as a waist doth girdle you about,

507
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.500
By the compulsion of their ordinance

508
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.530
By this time from their fixed beds of lime

509
00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:50.570
Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made

510
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:53.230
For bloody power to rush upon your peace.

511
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:58.230
But on the sight of us your lawful king,

512
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.930
Who painfully with much expedient march

513
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:03.330
Have brought a countercheque before your gates,

514
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:06.000
To save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks,

515
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.470
Behold, the French amazed vouchsafe a parle;

516
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:15.830
And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,

517
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:17.630
To make a shaking fever in your walls,

518
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:21.570
They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,

519
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:24.130
To make a faithless error in your ears:

520
00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.230
Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,

521
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:31.800
And let us in, your king, whose labour'd spirits,

522
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.700
Forwearied in this action of swift speed,

523
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:39.130
Crave harbourage within your city walls.

524
00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:43.730
When I have said, make answer to us both.

525
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:46.770
Lo, in this right hand, whose protection

526
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:49.600
Is most divinely vow'd upon the right

527
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.670
Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,

528
00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:55.400
Son to the elder brother of this man,

529
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.600
And king o'er him and all that he enjoys:

530
00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.300
For this down-trodden equity, we tread

531
00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.430
In warlike march these greens before your town,

532
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.300
Being no further enemy to you

533
00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.300
than the constraint of hospitable zeal

534
00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.430
In the relief of this oppressed child

535
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:17.530
Religiously provokes. Be pleased then to pay that duty

536
00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:20.630
which you truly owe

537
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:26.570
To him that owes it, namely this young prince:

538
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.430
And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,

539
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:33.530
Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up;

540
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:36.230
Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent

541
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.730
Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;

542
00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.530
And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,

543
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.970
With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised,

544
00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:48.600
We will bear home that lusty blood again

545
00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.970
Which here we came to spout against your town,

546
00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:55.270
And leave your children, wives and you in peace.

547
00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:02.700
But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,

548
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.100
'Tis not the roundure of

549
00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:09.500
your old-faced walls can hide you from our messengers of war,

550
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.200
Though all these English and their discipline

551
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.370
Were harbour'd in their rude circumference.

552
00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:18.970
Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,

553
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:23.030
In that behalf which we have challenged it?

554
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:26.930
Or shall we give the signal to our rage

555
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:30.770
And stalk in blood to our possession?

556
00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:35.070
In brief, we are the king of England's subjects:

557
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.700
For him, and in his right, we hold this town.

558
00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.030
Acknowledge then the king, and let me in.

559
00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:43.870
That can we not; but he that proves the king,

560
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:47.700
To him will we prove loyal: till that time

561
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.070
Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world.

562
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.270
Doth not the crown of England prove the king?

563
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:54.830
And if not that, I bring you witnesses,

564
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.700
Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed,--

565
00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.570
Bastards, and else.

566
00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.130
To verify our title with their lives.

567
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:03.870
As many and as well-born bloods as these,--

568
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:05.600
Some bastards too.

569
00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.270
Stand in his face to contradict his claim.

570
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:11.530
Till you compound whose right is worthiest,

571
00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:15.070
We for the worthiest hold the right from both.

572
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.400
Then God forgive the sin of all those souls

573
00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.200
That to their everlasting residence,

574
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.930
Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet,

575
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.730
In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!

576
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:41.570
Amen, amen! Mount, chevaliers! to arms!

Sits on his horseback at mine hostess' door,

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.900
Teach us some fence!

580
00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.430
Sirrah, were I at home,

581
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.570
At your den, sirrah, with your lioness

582
00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:53.930
I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,

583
00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.270
And make a monster of you.

584
00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:56.400
Peace! no more.

O tremble, for you hear the lion roar.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:02.170
Up higher to the plain; where we'll set forth

587

In best appointment all our regiments.

588
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:06.330
Speed then, to take advantage of the field.

589
00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.900
It shall be so; and at the other hill

590
00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:19.730
Command the rest to stand. God and our right!

And let young Arthur, Duke of Bretagne, in,

Who by the hand of France this day hath made

Much work for tears in many an English mother,

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:51.230
Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground;

597
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.500
Many a widow's husband grovelling lies,

Coldly embracing the discolour'd earth;

599
00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:59.200
And victory, with little loss, doth play

Upon the dancing banners of the French,

601
00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:04.030
Who are at hand, triumphantly display'd,

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:06.470
To enter conquerors and to proclaim

King John, your king and England's doth approach,

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.770
Commander of this hot malicious day:

Their armours, that march'd hence so silver-bright,

Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood;

There stuck no plume in any English crest

By our best eyes cannot be censured:

622
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:11.330
Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows;

623
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:15.800
Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power:

624

Both are alike; and both alike we like.

625
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:25.230
One must prove greatest: while they weigh so even,

626
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:29.870
We hold our town for neither, yet for both.

627
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:45.830
France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?

628
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:49.400
Say, shall the current of our right roam on?

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.370
Whose passage, vex'd with thy impediment,

630
00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:54.230
Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell

In this hot trial, more than we of France;

636
00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:16.900
Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,

637
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.700
That sways the earth this climate overlooks,

638
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.670
Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,

639
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:27.270
We'll put thee down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear,

640
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:30.930
Or add a royal number to the dead,

Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss

642
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.270
With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.

Ha, majesty! how high thy glory towers,

When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!

O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;

646
00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:49.830
The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;

647
00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:53.000
And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,

648
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.800
In undetermined differences of kings.

649
00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.500
Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?

650
00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.130
Cry, 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:04.870
You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!

652
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:06.570
Then let confusion of one part confirm the other's peace:

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:12.300
Till then, blows, blood and death!

654
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:16.930
Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?

655
00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:20.870
Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?

656
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:25.130
The king of England; when we know the king.

In us, that are our own great deputy

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:35.870
And bear possession of our person here,

Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.

661
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:42.670
A greater power then we denies all this;

662
00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:45.170
And till it be undoubted, we do lock

663
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:48.570
Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates;

664
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:52.430
King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolved,

665
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:58.370
Be by some certain king purged and deposed.

666
00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:04.470
By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,

667
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.430
And stand securely on their battlements,

668
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:09.000
As in a theatre, whence they gape and point

669
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.730
At your industrious scenes and acts of death.

670
00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:15.670
Your royal presences be ruled by me:

671
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:19.930
Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,

672
00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:22.670
Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend

673
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:25.270
Your sharpest deeds of malice against this town:

674
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:27.170
By east and west let France and England mount

675
00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:28.900
Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,

676
00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.300
Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down

677
00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:34.400
The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:

678
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.230
I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,

679
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:39.000
Even till unfenced desolation

680
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.930
Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.

681
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:45.400
That done, dissever your united strengths,

682
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.470
And part your mingled colours once again;

683
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:50.200
Turn face to face and bloody point to point;

684
00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.730
Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth

685
00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:53.970
Out of one side her happy minion,

686
00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:55.800
To whom in favour she shall give the day,

687
00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.300
And kiss him with a glorious victory.

688
00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.770
How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?

689
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:03.600
Smacks it not something of the policy?

690
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.900
Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,

691
00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:10.730
I like it well. Say France, shall we knit our powers

692
00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:13.600
And lay this Angiers even to the ground;

693
00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:18.830
Then after fight who shall be king of it?

694
00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:24.130
An if thou hast the mettle of a king,

695
00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:27.070
Being wronged as we are by this peevish town, why then,

696
00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:28.570
Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,

697
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:30.270
As we will ours, against these saucy walls;

698
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:31.870
And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,

699
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:34.630
Why then defy each other and pell-mell

700
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:39.370
Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.

701
00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:49.730
Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?

702
00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:52.700
We from the west will send destruction

703
00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.070
Into this city's bosom.

704
00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:56.770
I from the north.

705
00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:58.100
Our thunder from the south

706
00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.230
Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.

707
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.570
O prudent discipline! From north to south:

708
00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:06.070
Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:

709
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:09.330
I'll stir them to it. Come, away, away!

710
00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:13.230
Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,

711
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:16.870
And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league;

712
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:19.730
Win you this city without stroke or wound;

713
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:22.070
Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,

714
00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:25.230
That here come sacrifices for the field:

715
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:29.330
Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.

716
00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:32.830
Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.

717
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:35.870
That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,

718
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:39.470
Is niece to England: look upon the years

719
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:42.900
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:

720
00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.170
If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,

721
00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:48.630
Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?

722
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:51.000
If zealous love should go in search of virtue,

723
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.830
Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?

724
00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:55.900
If love ambitious sought a match of birth,

725
00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:00.170
Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?

726
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:02.570
Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,

727
00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:05.800
Is the young Dauphin every way complete:

728
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:10.800
If not complete of, say he is not she;

729
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.670
And she again wants nothing, to name want,

730
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:17.900
If want it be not that she is not he:

731
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.600
He is the half part of a blessed man,

732
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.270
Left to be finished by such as she;

733
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.770
And she a fair divided excellence,

734
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:28.800
Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.

735
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.200
O, two such silver currents, when they join,

736
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.730
Do glorify the banks that bound them in;

737
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:36.970
And two such shores to two such streams made one,

738
00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:40.230
Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,

739
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:43.330
To these two princes, if you marry them.

740
00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:46.270
This union shall do more than battery can

741
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:50.100
To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,

742
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:53.270
With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,

743
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:56.730
The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,

744
00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:01.530
And give you entrance: but without this match,

745
00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:05.130
The sea enraged is not half so deaf,

746
00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:08.070
Lions more confident, mountains and rocks

747
00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:11.470
More free from motion, no, not Death himself

748
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:13.630
In moral fury half so peremptory,

749
00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:17.200
As we to keep this city.

750
00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.700
Here's a stay

751
00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.700
That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death

752
00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:36.330
Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,

753
00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:40.530
That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,

754
00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:42.030
Talks as familiarly of roaring lions

755
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:44.700
As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!

756
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.870
What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?

757
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:49.830
He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;

758
00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:52.730
He gives the bastinado with his tongue:

759
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:55.600
Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his

760
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.070
But buffets better than a fist of France:

761
00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:02.430
Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words

762
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:05.470
Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.

763
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.730
Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;

764
00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:16.630
Give with our niece a dowry large enough:

765
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:19.130
For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie

766
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:23.170
Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,

767
00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:26.130
That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe

768
00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:31.730
The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.

769
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:34.400
I see a yielding in the looks of France;

770
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.230
Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls

771
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:40.800
Are capable of this ambition,

772
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.670
Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath

773
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:47.130
Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,

774
00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:49.900
Cool and congeal again to what it was.

775
00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.500
Why answer not the double majesties

776
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:56.730
This friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?

777
00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:01.630
Speak England first, that hath been forward first

778
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:06.430
To speak unto this city: what say you?

779
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:10.370
If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,

780
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:13.670
Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'

781
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:16.870
Then Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,

782
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:19.770
And all that we upon this side the sea,

783
00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:21.870
Except this city now by us besieged,

784
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:24.270
Find liable to our crown and dignity,

785
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:27.800
Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich

786
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.300
In titles, honours and promotions,

787
00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.200
As she in beauty, education, blood,

788
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.170
Holds hand with any princess of the world.

789
00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:43.470
What say'st thou, boy? look in the lady's face.

790
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:47.470
I do, my lord; and in her eye I find a wonder,

791
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:48.930
or a wondrous miracle,

792
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:51.570
The shadow of myself form'd in her eye:

793
00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:53.330
Which being but the shadow of your son,

794
00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:58.900
Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:

795
00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:02.130
I do protest I never loved myself

796
00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:05.170
Till now infixed I beheld myself

797
00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:10.130
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.

798
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.100
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!

799
00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:18.300
Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!

800
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.930
And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy

801
00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:27.430
Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,

802
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.400
That hang'd and drawn and quartered, there should be

803
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:34.200
In such a love so vile a lout as he.

804
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.800
My uncle's will in this respect is mine:

805
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.430
If he see aught in you that makes him like,

806
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:43.200
That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,

807
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.470
I can with ease translate it to my will;

808
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:49.100
Or if you will, to speak more properly,

809
00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:53.270
I will enforce it easily to my love.

810
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:55.270
Further I will not flatter you, my lord,

811
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:57.230
That all I see in you is worthy love,

812
00:44:57.230 --> 00:45:00.470
Than this; that nothing do I see in you,

813
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:02.430
Though churlish thoughts themselves

814
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.470
should be your judge,

815
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:07.100
That I can find should merit any hate.

816
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:15.670
What say these young ones? What say you my niece?

817
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:18.330
That she is bound in honour still to do

818
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:21.200
What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.

819
00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.200
Speak then, prince Dauphin; can'st thou love this lady?

820
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.430
Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;

821
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:30.230
For I do love her most unfeignedly.

822
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:33.330
Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,

823
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:36.200
Poictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,

824
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.200
With her to thee; and this addition more,

825
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.630
Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.

826
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:46.330
Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,

827
00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:50.400
Command thy son and daughter to join hands.

828
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.730
It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.

829
00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:57.200
And your lips too; for I am well assured

830
00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.770
That I did so when I was first assured.

831
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:08.630
Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,

832
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:11.230
Let in that amity which you have made;

833
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:13.930
For at Saint Mary's chapel presently

834
00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:17.370
The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.

835
00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:22.600
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?

836
00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.070
I know she is not, for this match made up

837
00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:27.230
Her presence would have interrupted much:

838
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:29.130
Where is she and her son? tell me, who knows.

839
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:32.400
She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.

840
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.930
And, by my faith, this league that we have made

841
00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:38.630
Will give her sadness very little cure.

842
00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.670
Brother of England, how may we content

843
00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:45.600
This widow lady? In her right we came;

844
00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.270
Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,

845
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:50.430
To our own vantage.

846
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:52.430
We will heal up all;

847
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:55.700
For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne

848
00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.630
And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town

849
00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:02.770
We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;

850
00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:04.330
Some speedy messenger bid her repair

851
00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:06.430
To our solemnity: I trust we shall,

852
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:08.530
If not fill up the measure of her will,

853
00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:10.670
Yet in some measure satisfy her so

854
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:14.530
That we shall stop her exclamation.

855
00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:16.130
Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,

856
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:20.630
To this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp.

857
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:49.000
Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!

858
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.700
John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,

859
00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.900
Hath willingly departed with a part,

860
00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.530
And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,

861
00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:59.770
Whom zeal and charity brought to the field

862
00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:03.100
As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear

863
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:07.830
With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,

864
00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:10.870
That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,

865
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:14.270
That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,

866
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:17.300
Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,

867
00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:18.900
Who, having no external thing to lose

868
00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.600
But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,

869
00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:30.800
That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,

870
00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:36.470
Commodity, the bias of the world,

871
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.700
The world, who of itself is balanced well,

872
00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:40.770
Made to run even upon even ground,

873
00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:44.600
Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,

874
00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.130
This sway of motion, this Commodity,

875
00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:49.870
Makes it take head from all indifferency,

876
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:53.570
From all direction, purpose, course, intent:

877
00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:55.830
And this same bias, this Commodity,

878
00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:58.830
This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,

879
00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:00.870
Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,

880
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:02.430
Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,

881
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:04.600
From a resolved and honourable war,

882
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:09.070
To a most base and vile-concluded peace.

883
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:09.870
(laughing)

884
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:15.070
And why rail I on this Commodity?

885
00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:18.700
But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:

886
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.370
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,

887
00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:23.670
When his fair angels would salute my palm;

888
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:27.970
But for that my hand, as unattempted yet,

889
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:31.830
Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.

890
00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:36.070
Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail

891
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:41.500
And say there is no sin but to be rich;

892
00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.730
And being rich, my virtue then will be

893
00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:48.270
To say there is no vice but beggary.

894
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:53.700
Since kings break faith upon commodity,

895
00:49:53.700 --> 00:50:00.230
Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.

896
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:09.000


897
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:18.930
Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!

898
00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:27.270
False blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!

899
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:35.770
Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?

900
00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:40.070
It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard:

901
00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:44.800
Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again:

902
00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:48.800
It cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so:

903
00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.270
I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word

904
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:53.270
Is but the vain breath of a common man:

905
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:55.270
Believe me, I do not believe thee, man;

906
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:59.000
I have a king's oath to the contrary.

907
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.030
Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,

908
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:06.670
For I am sick and capable of fears,

909
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:10.630
Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,

910
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:15.770
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,

911
00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:19.100
A woman, naturally born to fears;

912
00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.700
And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,

913
00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:24.000
With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,

914
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.330
But they will quake and tremble all this day.

915
00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:33.070
What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?

916
00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:38.530
Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?

917
00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:43.100
What means that hand upon that breast of thine?

918
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.330
Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,

919
00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:50.030
Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?

920
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:54.100
Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?

921
00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:59.170
Then speak again; not all thy former tale,

922
00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:05.830
But this one word, whether thy tale be true.

923
00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:08.000
As true as I believe you think them false

924
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.400
That give you cause to prove my saying true.

925
00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.200
O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,

926
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.230
Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,

927
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:20.600
And let belief and life encounter so

928
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.830
As doth the fury of two desperate men

929
00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:31.630
Which in the very meeting fall and die.

930
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:43.970
Lewis marry Blanch! O boy, then where art thou?

931
00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:50.530
France friend with England, what becomes of me?

932
00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:53.700
Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight:

933
00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.600
This news hath made thee a most ugly man.

934
00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:58.170
What other harm have I, good lady, done,

935
00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:00.170
But spoke the harm that is by others done?

936
00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:01.730
Which harm within itself so heinous is

937
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:04.800
As it makes harmful all that speak of it.

938
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.700
I do beseech you, madam, be content.

939
00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:13.070
If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,

940
00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:16.700
Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb,

941
00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:20.970
Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,

942
00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:25.900
Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,

943
00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:29.130
Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,

944
00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:33.070
I would not care, I then would be content,

945
00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:34.670
For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou

946
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:38.330
Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.

947
00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:41.870
But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,

948
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:48.470
Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:

949
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:50.700
Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,

950
00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:56.270
And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune,

951
00:53:56.270 --> 00:54:00.630
O, She is corrupted, changed and won from thee;

952
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:03.130
She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,

953
00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:06.630
And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France

954
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:09.230
To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,

955
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:14.470
And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.

956
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:21.100
France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,

957
00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:26.100
That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!

958
00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:32.470
Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?

959
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:35.530
Envenom him with words, or get thee gone

960
00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:36.630
And leave those woes alone which I alone

961
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:38.830
Am bound to under-bear.

962
00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:39.970
Pardon me, madam,

963
00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:43.430
I may not go without you to the kings.

964
00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:55.130
Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee:

965
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:58.800
I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;

966
00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:03.170
For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.

967
00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:08.570
To me and to the state of my great grief

968
00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:13.700
Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great

969
00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:17.230
That no supporter but the huge firm earth

970
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:24.170
Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;

971
00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:30.430
Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.

972
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:34.500
'Tis true, fair daughter; and this blessed day

973
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.570
Ever in France shall be kept festival:

974
00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:38.670
To solemnize this day the glorious sun

975
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:40.330
Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,

976
00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:43.470
Turning with splendor of his precious eye

977
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:46.730
The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold:

978
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:49.570
The yearly course that brings this day about

979
00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:52.330
Shall never see it but a holiday.

980
00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:56.000
A wicked day, and not a holy day!

981
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.770
What hath this day deserved? what hath it done,

982
00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:01.670
That it in golden letters should be writ

983
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:04.600
Among the high tides of the calendar?

984
00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.770
Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,

985
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:11.470
This day of shame, oppression, perjury.

986
00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:14.230
Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child

987
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:17.400
Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,

988
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.830
Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd:

989
00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:23.700
But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;

990
00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:26.870
No bargains break that are not this day made:

991
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:33.230
This day, all things begun come to ill end,

992
00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:38.330
Ney, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!

993
00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:42.300
By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause

994
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.400
To curse the fair proceedings of this day:

995
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:47.330
Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?

996
00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:51.970
You have beguiled me with a counterfeit

997
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:56.600
Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,

998
00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:03.600
Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;

999
00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:07.630
You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,

1000
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:11.700
But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:

1001
00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.630
The grappling vigour and rough frown of war

1002
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:19.670
Is cold in amity and painted peace,

1003
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:22.900
And our oppression hath made up this deed.

1004
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:27.070
Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings!

1005
00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:30.930
A widow cries; be husband to me, heavens!

1006
00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:32.770
Let not the hours of this ungodly day

1007
00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:35.770
Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset,

1008
00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:39.800
Set armed discord 'twixt these perjured kings!

1009
00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:42.770
Hear me, O, hear me!

1010
00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:44.770
Lady Constance, peace!

1011
00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:51.000
War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war

1012
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.100
O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame

1013
00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:59.570
That bloody spoil: thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!

1014
00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:01.470
Thou little valiant, great in villany!

1015
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:05.730
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!

1016
00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:10.470
Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight

1017
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:11.900
But when her humorous ladyship is by

1018
00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:16.970
To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,

1019
00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:21.700
And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou,

1020
00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:25.070
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear

1021
00:58:25.070 --> 00:58:30.200
Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,

1022
00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:33.200
Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,

1023
00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.770
Been sworn my champion, bidding me depend

1024
00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:38.730
Upon thy fate, thy fortune and thy strength,

1025
00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:41.870
And dost thou now fall over to my foes?

1026
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:45.700
Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,

1027
00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:49.800
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.

1028
00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.800
O, that a man should speak those words to me!

1029
00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.400
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.

1030
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.630
Thou darest not say so, villain, for thy life.

1031
00:58:57.630 --> 00:59:00.470
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.

1032
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:05.370
We like not this; thou dost forget thyself.

1033
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:13.530
Here comes the holy legate of the pope.

1034
00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:18.930
(♪singing)

1035
00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:27.370
Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!

1036
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:38.100
To thee, King John, my holy errand is.

1037
00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:39.830
I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,

1038
00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:42.300
And from Pope Innocent the legate here,

1039
00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:44.430
Do in his name religiously demand

1040
00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:48.500
Why thou against the church, our holy mother,

1041
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:53.100
So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce

1042
00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:56.430
Keep Stephen Langton, chosen archbishop

1043
00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:59.830
Of Canterbury, from that holy see?

1044
00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:01.930
This, in our foresaid holy father's name,

1045
01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:08.100
Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.

1046
01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.670
What earthy name to interrogatories

1047
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:14.870
Can task the free breath of a sacred king?

1048
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:17.830
Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name

1049
01:00:17.830 --> 01:00:20.800
So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,

1050
01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.970
To charge me to an answer, as the pope.

1051
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:28.470
Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England

1052
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:31.100
Add thus much more, that no Italian priest

1053
01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.400
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;

1054
01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.470
But as we, under God, are supreme head,

1055
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:38.430
So under Him that great supremacy,

1056
01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:41.530
Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,

1057
01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:45.030
Without the assistance of a mortal hand:

1058
01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:49.770
So tell the pope, all reverence set apart

1059
01:00:49.770 --> 01:00:52.970
To him and his usurp'd authority.

1060
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:55.670
Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.

1061
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:57.230
Though you and all the kings of Christendom

1062
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:59.970
Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,

1063
01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:03.700
Dreading the curse that money may buy out;

1064
01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:07.130
And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,

1065
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:09.100
Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,

1066
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:12.700
Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,

1067
01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.930
Though you and all the rest so grossly led

1068
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:19.100
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,

1069
01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.530
Yet I alone, alone do me oppose

1070
01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:24.770
Against the pope and count his friends my foes.

1071
01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:29.000
Then, by the lawful power that I have,

1072
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.700
Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate.

1073
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.670
And blessed shall he be that doth revolt

1074
01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:40.230
From his allegiance to an heretic;

1075
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:43.070
And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,

1076
01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:45.900
Canonized and worshipped as a saint,

1077
01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:50.400
That takes away by any secret course

1078
01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:55.070
Thy hateful life.

1079
01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:57.700
O, lawful let it be

1080
01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:01.500
That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!

1081
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.100
Good father cardinal, cry thou amen

1082
01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.600
To my keen curses; for without my wrong

1083
01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.430
There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.

1084
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:11.800
There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.

1085
01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.770
And for mine too: since law can do no right,

1086
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:18.930
Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong:

1087
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:23.500
Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,

1088
01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:26.270
For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;

1089
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:31.970
Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,

1090
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:35.530
How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?

1091
01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:38.600
Philip of France, on peril of a curse,

1092
01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.770
Let go the hand of that arch-heretic;

1093
01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:44.030
And raise the power of France upon his head,

1094
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:46.130
Unless he do submit himself to Rome.

1095
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:48.930
Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.

1096
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:53.230
Philip, what say'st thou to the cardinal?

1097
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:56.130
What should he say, but as the cardinal?

1098
01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:58.700
Bethink you, father; for the difference

1099
01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:00.730
Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,

1100
01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:02.970
Or the light loss of England for a friend:

1101
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:04.330
Forego the easier.

1102
01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:06.500
That's the curse of Rome.

1103
01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:09.800
O Lewis, stand fast! the devil tempts thee here

1104
01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.830
In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.

1105
01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:14.000
The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,

1106
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.530
But from her need.

1107
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:19.000
O, if thou grant my need,

1108
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Which only lives but by the death of faith,

1109
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.370
That need must needs infer this principle,

1110
01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:27.830
That faith would live again by death of need.

1111
01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:30.970
O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up;

1112
01:03:30.970 --> 01:03:33.570
Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!

1113
01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:36.530
The king is moved, and answers not to this.

1114
01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:39.670
O, be removed from him, and answer well!

1115
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:43.000
I am perplex'd, and know not what to say.

1116
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.730
What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,

1117
01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:51.470
If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?

1118
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:54.630
Good reverend father, make my person yours,

1119
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:57.530
And tell me how you would bestow yourself.

1120
01:03:57.530 --> 01:04:00.330
This royal hand and mine are newly knit,

1121
01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:02.130
And the conjunction of our inward souls

1122
01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:03.770
Married in league, coupled and linked together

1123
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:07.570
With all religious strength of sacred vows;

1124
01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:09.870
The latest breath that gave the sound of words

1125
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:13.570
Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love

1126
01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:17.570
Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,

1127
01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:20.030
And even before this truce, but new before,

1128
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:22.230
No longer than we well could wash our hands

1129
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:25.270
To clap this royal bargain up of peace,

1130
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:28.130
Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and over-stain'd

1131
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:33.900
With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint

1132
01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:38.100
The fearful difference of incensed kings:

1133
01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:43.500
And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,

1134
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:49.470
So newly sworn in faith, so strong in both,

1135
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:53.000
Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?

1136
01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:01.200
Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,

1137
01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.470
Make such unconstant children of ourselves,

1138
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:08.000
As now again to snatch our palm from palm,

1139
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.570
Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed

1140
01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:16.970
Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,

1141
01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:20.000
And make a riot on the gentle brow

1142
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,

1143
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.500
My reverend father, let it not be so!

1144
01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:33.970
Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose

1145
01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:40.600
Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest

1146
01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:44.870
To do your pleasure and continue friends.

1147
01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.800
All form is formless, order orderless,

1148
01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.900
Save what is opposite to England's love.

1149
01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:57.430
Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,

1150
01:05:57.430 --> 01:06:00.770
Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,

1151
01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:05.300
A mother's curse, on her revolting son.

1152
01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:08.100
France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,

1153
01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.200
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,

1154
01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.470
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,

1155
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:16.300
Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.

1156
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:21.770
I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.

1157
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:25.300
So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;

1158
01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:27.470
And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,

1159
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:31.200
Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow

1160
01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:35.300
First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,

1161
01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:38.030
That is, to be the champion of our church!

1162
01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:41.000
What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself

1163
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.230
And may not be performed by thyself,

1164
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:47.600
For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss

1165
01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:52.070
Is not amiss  if it be truly done,

1166
01:06:52.070 --> 01:06:54.030
And being not done, where doing tends to ill,

1167
01:06:54.030 --> 01:06:58.530
The truth is then best done not doing it:

1168
01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:03.270
The better act in purposes mistook

1169
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:07.400
Is to mistake again; though indirect,

1170
01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.570
Yet indirection thereby grows direct,

1171
01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:13.330
And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire

1172
01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:19.670
Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.

1173
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:25.100
It is religion that doth make vows kept;

1174
01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.670
But thou hast sworn against religion,

1175
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:31.170
By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,

1176
01:07:31.170 --> 01:07:34.230
And makest an oath the surety for thy truth

1177
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:38.900
Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure

1178
01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:41.170
To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;

1179
01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:44.770
Else what a mockery should it be to swear!

1180
01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:48.570
But thou hast sworn only to be forsworn;

1181
01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:52.770
And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.

1182
01:07:52.770 --> 01:07:55.000
Therefore thy later vows against thy first

1183
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.770
Is in thyself rebellion 'gainst thyself;

1184
01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:01.500
And better conquest never canst thou make

1185
01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:04.030
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts

1186
01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:08.800
Against these giddy loose suggestions:

1187
01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:12.230
Upon which better part our prayers come in,

1188
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:17.930
If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know

1189
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:21.630
The peril of our curses light on thee

1190
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:26.300
So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,

1191
01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:30.830
But in despair die under their black weight.

1192
01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:37.830
Rebellion, flat rebellion!

1193
01:08:37.830 --> 01:08:38.870
Will't not be?

1194
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:41.470
Will not a calfs-skin stop that mouth of thine?

1195
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:44.300
Father, to arms!

1196
01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.330
Upon thy wedding-day?

1197
01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:48.530
Against the blood that thou hast married?

1198
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:51.330
What, shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men?

1199
01:08:51.330 --> 01:08:53.900
Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,

1200
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:57.100
Clamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?

1201
01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:00.700
O husband, hear me! alack, how new

1202
01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:04.900
Is husband in my mouth! even for that name,

1203
01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:07.270
Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce,

1204
01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:09.770
Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms

1205
01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:11.000
Against mine uncle.

1206
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:11.930
O, upon my knee,

1207
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:13.600
Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,

1208
01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.970
Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom

1209
01:09:15.970 --> 01:09:17.670
Forethought by heaven!

1210
01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:19.870
Now shall I see thy love: what motive may

1211
01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:22.200
Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?

1212
01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.170
That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,

1213
01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:32.530
His honour: O, thine honour, Lewis, thine honour!

1214
01:09:32.530 --> 01:09:35.900
I muse your majesty doth seem so cold,

1215
01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:39.830
When such profound respects do pull you on.

1216
01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:43.070
I will denounce a curse upon his head.

1217
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:57.070
Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee.

1218
01:09:58.530 --> 01:10:01.900
(♪drums)

1219
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:06.770
O fair return of banish'd majesty!

1220
01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:10.930
O foul revolt of French inconstancy!

1221
01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:15.570
France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.

1222
01:10:15.570 --> 01:10:20.230
Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,

1223
01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:25.500
Is it as he will? well then, France shall rue.

1224
01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:44.070
The sun's o'ercast with blood: fair day, adieu!

1225
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:47.800
Which is the side that I must go withal?

1226
01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.830
I am with both: each army hath a hand;

1227
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:53.270
And in their rage, I having hold of both,

1228
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:56.700
They swirl asunder and dismember me.

1229
01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:00.300
Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;

1230
01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:03.370
Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;

1231
01:11:03.370 --> 01:11:05.930
Father, I may not wish the fortune thine;

1232
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:09.070
Grandam, I may not wish thy wishes thrive:

1233
01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:13.270
Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose

1234
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:18.500
Assured loss before the match be play'd.

1235
01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:23.670
Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.

1236
01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:30.470
There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.

1237
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:35.630
Cousin, go draw our puissance together.

1238
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:38.930
France, I am burn'd up with inflaming wrath;

1239
01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:41.730
A rage whose heat hath this condition,

1240
01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:45.270
That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,

1241
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:49.100
The blood, and dearest-valued blood, of France.

1242
01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:53.300
Thy rage sham burn thee up, and thou shalt turn

1243
01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:58.330
To ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire:

1244
01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:02.800
Look to thyself, thou art in jeopardy.

1245
01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:07.170
No more than he that threats. To arms let's hie!

1246
01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:15.830
Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;

1247
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:18.770
Some airy devil hovers in the sky

1248
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:24.570
And pours down mischief. Austria's head lie thou there,

1249
01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:26.930
While Philip breathes.

1250
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:30.270
Hubert, keep this boy. Philip, make haste:

1251
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:31.870
My mother is assailed in our tent,

1252
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:32.770
And ta'en, I fear.

1253
01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:34.030
My lord, I rescued her;

1254
01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:35.830
Her highness is in safety, fear you not:

1255
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:38.070
But on, my liege; for very little pains

1256
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:41.070
Will bring this labour to an happy end.

1257
01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:45.230
So shall it be; your grace shall stay behind

1258
01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:47.430
So strongly guarded.

1259
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:50.470
Cousin, look not sad:

1260
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:52.670
Thy grandam loves thee; and thy uncle will

1261
01:12:52.670 --> 01:12:55.600
As dear be to thee as thy father was.

1262
01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.500
O, this will make my mother die with grief!

1263
01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:02.830
Cousin, away for England!  haste before:

1264
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:05.200
And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bags

1265
01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.470
Of hoarding abbots; imprisoned angels

1266
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:09.900
Set at liberty: the fat ribs of peace

1267
01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:13.230
Must by the hungry now be fed upon:

1268
01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:14.370
Use our commission in his utmost force.

1269
01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:16.830
Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back,

1270
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:19.070
When gold and silver becks me to come on.

1271
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:24.000
I leave your highness. Grandam, I will pray,

1272
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.470
If ever I remember to be holy,

1273
01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:31.570
For your fair safety; so, I kiss your hand.

1274
01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.770
Farewell, gentle cousin.

1275
01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:46.770
Coz, farewell.

1276
01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:51.070
Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.

1277
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:53.070
Come hither, Hubert.

1278
01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:04.600
O my gentle Hubert,

1279
01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.900
We owe thee much! within this wall of flesh

1280
01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:10.500
There is a soul counts thee her creditor

1281
01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:13.870
And with advantage means to pay thy love:

1282
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:16.230
And my good friend, thy voluntary oath

1283
01:14:16.230 --> 01:14:19.170
Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished.

1284
01:14:19.170 --> 01:14:20.830
Give me thy hand.

1285
01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:26.900
I had a thing to say,

1286
01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:31.430
But I will fit it with some better tune.

1287
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:34.230
By heaven, Hubert, I am almost ashamed

1288
01:14:34.230 --> 01:14:36.630
To say what good respect I have of thee.

1289
01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:38.270
I am much bounden to your majesty.

1290
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:40.700
Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,

1291
01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:44.330
But thou shalt have; and creep time ne'er so slow,

1292
01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:46.630
Yet it shall come from me to do thee good.

1293
01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:53.770
I had a thing to say, but let it go:

1294
01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:56.370
The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,

1295
01:14:56.370 --> 01:14:57.930
Attended with the pleasures of the world,

1296
01:14:57.930 --> 01:15:00.630
Is all too wanton and too full of gawds

1297
01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:04.200
To give me audience: if the midnight bell

1298
01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.130
Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,

1299
01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:10.930
Sound on into the drowsy race of night;

1300
01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:13.300
If this same were a churchyard where we stand,

1301
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:17.130
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,

1302
01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:20.770
Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,

1303
01:15:20.770 --> 01:15:24.970
Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,

1304
01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:27.170
Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,

1305
01:15:27.170 --> 01:15:29.970
Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes

1306
01:15:29.970 --> 01:15:34.270
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,

1307
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:37.630
A passion hateful to my purposes,

1308
01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:39.800
Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,

1309
01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.230
Hear me without thine ears, and make reply

1310
01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:45.570
Without a tongue, using conceit alone,

1311
01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:48.630
Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words;

1312
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:51.670
Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,

1313
01:15:51.670 --> 01:15:55.900
I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:

1314
01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:03.100
But, ah, I will not! yet I love thee well;

1315
01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.200
And, by my troth, I think thou lovest me well.

1316
01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.600
So well, that what you bid me undertake,

1317
01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.430
Though that my death were adjunct to my act,

1318
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:10.670
By heaven, I would do it.

1319
01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:13.130
Do not I know thou wouldst?

1320
01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:18.630
Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye

1321
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:24.170
On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,

1322
01:16:24.170 --> 01:16:26.830
He is a very serpent in my way;

1323
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:29.100
And whereso'er this foot of mine doth tread,

1324
01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:33.470
He lies before me: dost thou understand me?

1325
01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:35.170
Thou art his keeper.

1326
01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:36.400
And I'll keep him so,

1327
01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.100
That he shall not offend your majesty.

1328
01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:38.930
Death.

1329
01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:39.670
My lord?

1330
01:16:39.670 --> 01:16:41.770
A grave.

1331
01:16:42.670 --> 01:16:45.130
He shall not live.

1332
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:47.730
Enough.

1333
01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:57.530
I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee;

1334
01:16:57.530 --> 01:17:01.030
Well, I'll not say what I intend for thee:

1335
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:04.170
Remember. Madam, fare you well:

1336
01:17:04.170 --> 01:17:07.500
I'll send those powers o'er to your majesty.

1337
01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:10.670
My blessing go with thee!

1338
01:17:10.670 --> 01:17:13.300
Cousin, Away for England, go:

1339
01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:15.330
Hubert shall be your man, attend on you

1340
01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:21.400
With all true duty. On toward Calais, ho!

1341
01:17:32.770 --> 01:17:35.270
So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,

1342
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:37.400
A whole armado of convicted sail

1343
01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.070
Is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship.

1344
01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:46.070
Courage and comfort! all shall yet go well.

1345
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:49.430
What can go well, when we have run so ill?

1346
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:52.270
Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?

1347
01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:57.030
Arthur ta'en prisoner? divers dear friends slain?

1348
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:59.530
And bloody England into England gone,

1349
01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:03.100
O'erbearing interruption, spite of France?

1350
01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:06.530
What he hath won, that hath he fortified:

1351
01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:09.070
So hot a speed with such advice disposed,

1352
01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:11.830
Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,

1353
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:15.270
Doth want example: who hath read or heard

1354
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:16.500
Of any kindred action like to this?

1355
01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.470
Well could I bear that England had this praise,

1356
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:24.170
So we could find some pattern of our shame.

1357
01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:29.830
Look, who comes here! a grave unto a soul;

1358
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.170
Holding the eternal spirit against her will,

1359
01:18:32.170 --> 01:18:37.470
In the vile prison of afflicted breath.

1360
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:40.230
I prithee, lady, go away with me.

1361
01:18:40.230 --> 01:18:45.870
Lo, now I now see the issue of your peace.

1362
01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:48.100
Patience, good lady! comfort, gentle Constance!

1363
01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:52.230
No, I defy all counsel, all redress,

1364
01:18:52.230 --> 01:18:56.330
Save that which ends all counsel, true redress,

1365
01:18:56.330 --> 01:19:04.170
Death, death; O amiable lovely death!

1366
01:19:04.170 --> 01:19:10.870
Thou odouriferous stench! sound rottenness!

1367
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:14.300
Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,

1368
01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:17.170
Thou hate and terror to prosperity,

1369
01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:20.000
And I will kiss thy detestable bones

1370
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.800
And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows

1371
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:26.430
And ring my fingers with thy household worms

1372
01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:31.530
And be a carrion monster like thyself:

1373
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:36.730
Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smilest

1374
01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:41.130
And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,

1375
01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:42.930
O, come to me!

1376
01:19:42.930 --> 01:19:44.100
O fair affliction, peace!

1377
01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:47.530
No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:

1378
01:19:47.530 --> 01:19:49.700
O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!

1379
01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:53.270
Then with a passion would I shake the world;

1380
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:55.400
And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy

1381
01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.270
That cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,

1382
01:19:58.270 --> 01:20:01.430
Which scorns a modern invocation.

1383
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:04.770
Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.

1384
01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:10.630
Thou art not holy to belie me so;

1385
01:20:10.630 --> 01:20:16.230
I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;

1386
01:20:16.230 --> 01:20:18.370
My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;

1387
01:20:18.370 --> 01:20:23.270
Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:

1388
01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:29.830
I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!

1389
01:20:30.670 --> 01:20:34.370
For then, 'tis like I could forget myself:

1390
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:38.730
O, if I could, what grief should I forget!

1391
01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:42.200
Preach some philosophy to make me mad,

1392
01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:46.270
And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;

1393
01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:50.200
For being not mad but sensible of grief,

1394
01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.930
My reasonable part produces reason

1395
01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:56.970
How I may be deliver'd of these woes,

1396
01:20:56.970 --> 01:21:02.330
And teaches me to kill or hang myself:

1397
01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:06.430
If I were mad, I should forget my son,

1398
01:21:06.430 --> 01:21:09.400
Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:

1399
01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:14.730
I am not mad; too well, too well I feel

1400
01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:18.800
The different plague of each calamity.

1401
01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.270
Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note

1402
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:25.500
In the fair multitude of those her hairs!

1403
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:28.600
Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,

1404
01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:32.230
Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends

1405
01:21:32.230 --> 01:21:34.630
Do glue themselves in sociable grief,

1406
01:21:34.630 --> 01:21:38.970
Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,

1407
01:21:38.970 --> 01:21:40.930
Sticking together in calamity.

1408
01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:43.730
To England, if you will.

1409
01:21:43.730 --> 01:21:45.600
Bind up your hairs.

1410
01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.530
Aye, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?

1411
01:21:48.530 --> 01:21:51.630
I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud

1412
01:21:51.630 --> 01:21:53.830
'O that these hands could so redeem my son,

1413
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:56.500
As they have given these hairs their liberty!'

1414
01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.070
But now I envy at their liberty,

1415
01:21:58.070 --> 01:22:00.900
And will again commit them to their bonds,

1416
01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:04.330
Because my poor boy is a prisoner.

1417
01:22:04.330 --> 01:22:08.930
And, father cardinal, I have heard you say

1418
01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:14.000
That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:

1419
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.800
If that be so, I shall see my child again;

1420
01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:21.030
For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,

1421
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:23.230
To him that did but yesterday suspire,

1422
01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:27.370
There was not such a gracious creature born.

1423
01:22:27.370 --> 01:22:31.430
And now will canker-sorrow eat my bud

1424
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:35.630
And chase the native beauty from his cheek

1425
01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:40.200
And he will look as hollow as a ghost,

1426
01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:44.830
As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,

1427
01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:51.200
And so he'll die; and, rising so again,

1428
01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:56.330
When I shall meet him at the court of heaven

1429
01:22:56.330 --> 01:23:02.670
I shall not know him: therefore never, never

1430
01:23:02.670 --> 01:23:06.070
Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.

1431
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:10.870
You hold too heinous a respect of grief.

1432
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:13.130
He talks to me that never had a son.

1433
01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:15.700
You are as fond of grief as of your child.

1434
01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:24.370
Grief fills the room up of my absent child,

1435
01:23:24.370 --> 01:23:29.000
Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,

1436
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.470
Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his ways,

1437
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:38.930
Stuffs out his gracious garments with his form;

1438
01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:42.030
Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?

1439
01:23:44.730 --> 01:23:52.170
So fare you well: had you such a loss as I,

1440
01:23:52.170 --> 01:23:56.930
I could give better comfort than you have.

1441
01:23:56.930 --> 01:24:04.100
I will not keep this form upon my head,

1442
01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:10.800
When there is such disorder in my wit.

1443
01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:21.470
O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!

1444
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:29.100
My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!

1445
01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:36.470
My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!

1446
01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:44.030
I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.

1447
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:57.370
There's nothing in this world can make me joy:

1448
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:06.870
Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale

1449
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:11.400
Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;

1450
01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:14.470
And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste

1451
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:19.100
That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.

1452
01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:23.770
Before the curing of a strong disease,

1453
01:25:23.770 --> 01:25:25.630
Even in the instant of repair and health,

1454
01:25:25.630 --> 01:25:29.530
The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,

1455
01:25:29.530 --> 01:25:35.630
On their departure most of all show evil:

1456
01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:41.600
What have you lost by losing of this day?

1457
01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:46.370
All days of glory, joy and happiness.

1458
01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:49.500
If you had won it, certainly you had.

1459
01:25:51.570 --> 01:25:54.530
No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,

1460
01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:58.000
She looks upon them with a threatening eye.

1461
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.900
'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost

1462
01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:07.570
In this which he accounts so clearly won:

1463
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:11.230
Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?

1464
01:26:11.230 --> 01:26:13.830
As heartily as he is glad he hath him.

1465
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:19.000
Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.

1466
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.530
Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;

1467
01:26:20.530 --> 01:26:23.000
For even the breath of what I mean to speak

1468
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.970
Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,

1469
01:26:27.970 --> 01:26:31.000
Out of the path that shall directly lead

1470
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:41.970
Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.

1471
01:26:41.970 --> 01:26:45.170
John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be

1472
01:26:45.170 --> 01:26:48.400
That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,

1473
01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:51.470
The misplaced John should entertain an hour,

1474
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:55.730
One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.

1475
01:26:55.730 --> 01:26:57.600
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand

1476
01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:01.330
Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;

1477
01:27:01.330 --> 01:27:03.730
And he that stands upon a slippery place

1478
01:27:03.730 --> 01:27:08.900
Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:

1479
01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:15.130
That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall;

1480
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:20.430
So be it, for it cannot be but so.

1481
01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:24.200
But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?

1482
01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:31.670
You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,

1483
01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:36.100
May then make all the claim that Arthur did.

1484
01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:40.030
And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.

1485
01:27:40.030 --> 01:27:44.600
How green you are and fresh in this old world!

1486
01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:50.900
John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;

1487
01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:53.130
For he that steeps his safety in true blood

1488
01:27:53.130 --> 01:27:55.930
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.

1489
01:27:55.930 --> 01:27:59.630
This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts

1490
01:27:59.630 --> 01:28:03.170
Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,

1491
01:28:03.170 --> 01:28:05.300
That none so small advantage shall step forth

1492
01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:08.030
To cheque his reign, but they will cherish it;

1493
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:11.470
No natural exhalation in the sky,

1494
01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:15.200
No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,

1495
01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.000
No common wind, no customed event,

1496
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.730
But they will pluck away his natural cause

1497
01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:24.670
And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,

1498
01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:28.130
Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,

1499
01:28:28.130 --> 01:28:31.670
Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.

1500
01:28:31.670 --> 01:28:33.300
May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,

1501
01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:36.070
But hold himself safe in his prisonment.

1502
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:42.430
O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,

1503
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:47.600
If that young Arthur be not gone already,

1504
01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:54.830
Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts

1505
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:57.330
Of all his people shall revolt from him

1506
01:28:57.330 --> 01:29:02.430
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change

1507
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:04.330
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath

1508
01:29:04.330 --> 01:29:07.600
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.

1509
01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:10.670
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:

1510
01:29:10.670 --> 01:29:13.070
And, O, what better matter breeds for you

1511
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:16.470
Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge

1512
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:20.170
Is now in England, ransacking the church,

1513
01:29:20.170 --> 01:29:23.270
Offending charity: if but a dozen French

1514
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:24.970
Were there in arms, they would be as a call

1515
01:29:24.970 --> 01:29:28.600
To train ten thousand English to their side,

1516
01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:33.570
Or as a little snow, tumbled about,

1517
01:29:33.570 --> 01:29:39.900
Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,

1518
01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:43.470
Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful

1519
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:45.830
What may be wrought out of their discontent,

1520
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:49.430
Now that their souls are topful of offence.

1521
01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:56.670
For England go: I will whet on the king.

1522
01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:08.830
Strong reasons make strong actions: let us go:

1523
01:30:08.830 --> 01:30:13.370
If you say ay, the king will not say no.

1524
01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:16.300
(♪singing)

1525
01:30:19.770 --> 01:30:21.230


1526
01:30:49.230 --> 01:30:50.830
Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand

1527
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:53.270
Within the arras: when I strike my foot

1528
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:55.200
Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,

1529
01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.100
And bind the boy which you shall find with me

1530
01:30:57.100 --> 01:31:00.700
Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence, and watch.

1531
01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:02.200
I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.

1532
01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:05.400
Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't.

1533
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.570
Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.

1534
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:28.700
Good morrow, Hubert.

1535
01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:30.630
Good morrow, little prince.

1536
01:31:30.630 --> 01:31:32.370
As little prince, having so great a title

1537
01:31:32.370 --> 01:31:36.230
To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.

1538
01:31:36.230 --> 01:31:38.830
Indeed, I have been merrier.

1539
01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:40.070
Mercy on me!

1540
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:42.770
Methinks no body should be sad but I:

1541
01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:44.800
Yet, I remember, when I was in France,

1542
01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.570
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,

1543
01:31:46.570 --> 01:31:47.770
Only for wantonness.

1544
01:31:47.770 --> 01:31:49.400
If I talk to him, with his innocent prate

1545
01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:51.730
He will awake my mercy which lies dead:

1546
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:56.400
Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.

1547
01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:00.300
Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:

1548
01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:02.070
In sooth, I would you were a little sick,

1549
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:04.400
That I might sit all night and watch with you:

1550
01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:06.830
I warrant I love you more than you do me.

1551
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:11.100
His words do take possession of my bosom.

1552
01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:14.930
Read here, young Arthur.

1553
01:32:17.370 --> 01:32:20.130
How now, foolish rheum!

1554
01:32:20.130 --> 01:32:24.470
Turning dispiteous torture out of door!

1555
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:26.800
I must be brief, lest resolution drop

1556
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:31.170
Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.

1557
01:32:35.670 --> 01:32:39.070
Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?

1558
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:43.570
Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:

1559
01:32:43.570 --> 01:32:45.970
Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?

1560
01:32:45.970 --> 01:32:47.270
Young boy, I must.

1561
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:48.000
And will you?

1562
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.300
And I will.

1563
01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:50.770
Have you the heart?

1564
01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:52.300
I have sworn to do it;

1565
01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:55.200
And with hot irons must I burn them out.

1566
01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.030
An if an angel should have come to me

1567
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:59.200
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,

1568
01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:03.700
I would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert's.

1569
01:33:06.230 --> 01:33:07.670
Come forth.

1570
01:33:07.670 --> 01:33:09.330
Do as I bid you do.

1571
01:33:09.330 --> 01:33:11.870
O, save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are out

1572
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:14.100
Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.

1573
01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:15.530
Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.

1574
01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:17.730
Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?

1575
01:33:17.730 --> 01:33:21.100
I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.

1576
01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:23.400
For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!

1577
01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:25.670
Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,

1578
01:33:25.670 --> 01:33:27.500
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;

1579
01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.930
I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,

1580
01:33:29.930 --> 01:33:31.970
Nor look upon the iron angerly:

1581
01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:33.500
Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,

1582
01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:36.770
Whatever torment you do put me to.

1583
01:33:37.530 --> 01:33:40.500
Go, stand within; let me alone with him.

1584
01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:42.870
I am best pleased to be from such a deed.

1585
01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:48.970
Alas, I then have chid away my friend!

1586
01:33:48.970 --> 01:33:51.600
He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart:

1587
01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.500
Let him come back, that his compassion may

1588
01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:55.070
Give life to yours.

1589
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:56.630
Come, boy, prepare yourself.

1590
01:33:56.630 --> 01:33:57.730
Is there no remedy?

1591
01:33:57.730 --> 01:33:59.400
None, but to lose your eyes.

1592
01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:02.170
O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,

1593
01:34:02.170 --> 01:34:05.370
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,

1594
01:34:05.370 --> 01:34:07.270
Any annoyance in that precious sense!

1595
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:09.570
Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,

1596
01:34:09.570 --> 01:34:12.700
Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.

1597
01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:16.200
Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.

1598
01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.670
Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues

1599
01:34:17.670 --> 01:34:20.130
Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:

1600
01:34:20.130 --> 01:34:22.700
Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;

1601
01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:25.130
Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,

1602
01:34:25.130 --> 01:34:28.570
So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes.

1603
01:34:28.570 --> 01:34:31.330
Though to no use but still to look on you!

1604
01:34:31.330 --> 01:34:35.370
Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold

1605
01:34:35.370 --> 01:34:36.870
And would not harm me.

1606
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:39.030
I can heat it, boy.

1607
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:42.830
No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief,

1608
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:44.030
Being create for comfort, to be used

1609
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:47.530
In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;

1610
01:34:47.530 --> 01:34:50.500
There is no malice in this burning coal;

1611
01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.400
The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out

1612
01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:54.200
And strew'd repentent ashes on his head.

1613
01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.400
But with my breath I can revive it, boy.

1614
01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:58.570
An if you do, you will but make it blush

1615
01:34:58.570 --> 01:35:01.730
And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:

1616
01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:04.670
Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;

1617
01:35:04.670 --> 01:35:07.070
And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,

1618
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:09.970
Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.

1619
01:35:13.170 --> 01:35:19.670
Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye

1620
01:35:19.670 --> 01:35:24.470
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:

1621
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:27.130
Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,

1622
01:35:27.130 --> 01:35:30.730
With this same very iron to burn them out.

1623
01:35:30.730 --> 01:35:32.630
O, now you look like Hubert! all this while

1624
01:35:32.630 --> 01:35:34.070
You were disguised.

1625
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:37.000
Peace; no more. Adieu.

1626
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.030
Your uncle must not know but you are dead;

1627
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:43.130
I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:

1628
01:35:43.130 --> 01:35:48.570
And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,

1629
01:35:48.570 --> 01:35:51.700
That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,

1630
01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:53.800
Will not offend thee.

1631
01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:56.530
O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.

1632
01:35:56.530 --> 01:36:01.700
Silence; no more: go closely in with me:

1633
01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:03.930
Much danger do I undergo for thee.

1634
01:36:05.630 --> 01:36:08.970
(♪ horns play for scene break)

1635
01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:26.630
Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,

1636
01:36:26.630 --> 01:36:30.700
And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.

1637
01:36:33.970 --> 01:36:38.000
This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,

1638
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.070
Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,

1639
01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:44.300
And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,

1640
01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:47.030
The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;

1641
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:49.430
Fresh expectation troubled not the land

1642
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:53.000
With any long'd-for change or better state.

1643
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.170
Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,

1644
01:36:55.170 --> 01:36:57.600
To guard a title that was rich before,

1645
01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:00.770
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,

1646
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:02.170
To throw a perfume on the violet,

1647
01:37:02.170 --> 01:37:04.400
To smooth the ice, or add another hue

1648
01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.430
Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light

1649
01:37:06.430 --> 01:37:08.670
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,

1650
01:37:08.670 --> 01:37:11.600
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.

1651
01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:16.300
But that your royal pleasure must be done,

1652
01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:20.370
This act is as an ancient tale new told,

1653
01:37:20.370 --> 01:37:23.070
And in the last repeating troublesome,

1654
01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:27.000
Being urged at a time unseasonable.

1655
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.230
In this the antique and well noted face

1656
01:37:29.230 --> 01:37:31.600
Of plain old form is much disfigured;

1657
01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.300
And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,

1658
01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:36.570
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,

1659
01:37:36.570 --> 01:37:38.630
Startles and frights consideration,

1660
01:37:38.630 --> 01:37:41.470
Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,

1661
01:37:41.470 --> 01:37:44.230
For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.

1662
01:37:44.230 --> 01:37:47.770
When workmen strive to do better than well,

1663
01:37:47.770 --> 01:37:51.730
They do confound their skill in covetousness;

1664
01:37:51.730 --> 01:37:54.300
And oftentimes excusing of a fault

1665
01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:56.400
Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,

1666
01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:59.070
As patches set upon a little breach

1667
01:37:59.070 --> 01:38:01.370
Discredit more in hiding of the fault

1668
01:38:01.370 --> 01:38:04.000
Than did the fault itself before it was so patch'd.

1669
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.970
To this effect, before you were new crown'd,

1670
01:38:06.970 --> 01:38:09.470
We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness

1671
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:15.200
To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,

1672
01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:16.670
Since all and every part of what we would

1673
01:38:16.670 --> 01:38:20.430
Doth make a stand at what your highness will.

1674
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:24.570
Some reasons of this double coronation

1675
01:38:24.570 --> 01:38:28.730
I have possess'd you with and think them strong;

1676
01:38:28.730 --> 01:38:31.300
And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,

1677
01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:34.230
I shall indue you with: meantime but ask

1678
01:38:34.230 --> 01:38:36.930
What you would have reform'd that is not well,

1679
01:38:36.930 --> 01:38:39.200
And well shall you perceive how willingly

1680
01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.300
I will both hear and grant you your requests.

1681
01:38:45.970 --> 01:38:48.500
Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,

1682
01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:51.170
To sound the purpose of all their hearts,

1683
01:38:51.170 --> 01:38:56.700
Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,

1684
01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:59.330
Your safety, for the which myself and them

1685
01:38:59.330 --> 01:39:04.300
Bend their best studies, heartily request

1686
01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:11.070
The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint

1687
01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:12.730
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent

1688
01:39:12.730 --> 01:39:16.500
To break into this dangerous argument,--

1689
01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:23.170
If what in rest you have in right you hold,

1690
01:39:23.170 --> 01:39:26.030
Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend

1691
01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:29.500
The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up

1692
01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:32.100
Your tender kinsman and to choke his days

1693
01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:34.630
With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth

1694
01:39:34.630 --> 01:39:37.500
The rich advantage of good exercise?

1695
01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:43.370
That the time's enemies may not have this

1696
01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:47.270
To grace occasions, let it be our suit

1697
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:51.470
That you have bid us ask his liberty;

1698
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:54.900
Which for our goods we do no further ask

1699
01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:58.170
Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,

1700
01:39:58.170 --> 01:40:03.570
Counts it your weal he have his liberty.

1701
01:40:06.630 --> 01:40:09.670
Let it be so: I do commit his youth

1702
01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:13.700
To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?

1703
01:40:21.230 --> 01:40:23.930
This is the man should do the bloody deed;

1704
01:40:23.930 --> 01:40:27.270
He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:

1705
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:30.400
The image of a wicked heinous fault

1706
01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:33.430
Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his

1707
01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:36.570
Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;

1708
01:40:36.570 --> 01:40:39.000
And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,

1709
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.770
What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.

1710
01:40:43.530 --> 01:40:45.300
The colour of the king doth come and go

1711
01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:46.800
Between his purpose and his conscience,

1712
01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:50.230
Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:

1713
01:40:50.230 --> 01:40:53.030
His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.

1714
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:55.530
And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence

1715
01:40:55.530 --> 01:40:58.800
The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.

1716
01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:08.430
We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:

1717
01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:12.230
Good lords, although my will to give is living,

1718
01:41:12.230 --> 01:41:15.200
The suit which you demand is gone and dead:

1719
01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:18.000
He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.

1720
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.630
Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.

1721
01:41:21.630 --> 01:41:25.670
Indeed we heard how near his death he was

1722
01:41:25.670 --> 01:41:29.830
Before the child himself felt he was sick:

1723
01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:34.000
This must be answer'd either here or hence.

1724
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:52.100
Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?

1725
01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:54.800
Think you I bear the shears of destiny?

1726
01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:57.970
Have I commandment on the pulse of life?

1727
01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:02.800
It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame

1728
01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:05.570
That greatness should so grossly offer it:

1729
01:42:10.630 --> 01:42:14.470
So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.

1730
01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:18.470
Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,

1731
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:21.470
And find the inheritance of this poor child,

1732
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:27.430
His little kingdom of a forced grave.

1733
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:31.470
That blood which owed the breadth of all this land,

1734
01:42:31.470 --> 01:42:37.330
Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!

1735
01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:44.130
This must not be thus borne: this will break out

1736
01:42:44.130 --> 01:42:48.970
To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.

1737
01:42:57.530 --> 01:43:00.530
They burn in indignation. I repent:

1738
01:43:00.530 --> 01:43:03.170
There is no sure foundation set on blood,

1739
01:43:03.170 --> 01:43:06.970
No certain life achieved by others' death.

1740
01:43:06.970 --> 01:43:13.970
A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood

1741
01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:16.070
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?

1742
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:19.530
So foul a sky clears not without a storm:

1743
01:43:19.530 --> 01:43:22.570
Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?

1744
01:43:22.570 --> 01:43:26.100
From France to England. Never such a power

1745
01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:27.130
For any foreign preparation

1746
01:43:27.130 --> 01:43:29.530
Was levied in the body of a land.

1747
01:43:29.530 --> 01:43:32.600
The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;

1748
01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.900
For when you should be told they do prepare,

1749
01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:37.500
The tidings come that they are all arrived.

1750
01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:40.370
O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?

1751
01:43:40.370 --> 01:43:43.400
Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,

1752
01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:45.170
That such an army could be drawn in France,

1753
01:43:45.170 --> 01:43:47.670
And she not hear of it?

1754
01:43:47.670 --> 01:43:50.170
My liege, her ear

1755
01:43:50.170 --> 01:43:54.830
Is stopp'd with dust; the first of April died

1756
01:43:54.830 --> 01:44:02.200
Your noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,

1757
01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:03.670
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died

1758
01:44:03.670 --> 01:44:06.530
Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue

1759
01:44:06.530 --> 01:44:10.600
I idly heard; if true or false I know not.

1760
01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:14.370
Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!

1761
01:44:14.370 --> 01:44:16.730
O, make a league with me, till I have pleased

1762
01:44:16.730 --> 01:44:18.870
My discontented peers! What! mother dead!

1763
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:25.870
How wildly then walks my estate in France!

1764
01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:28.100
Under whose conduct came those powers of

1765
01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:30.930
Thou for truth givest out are landed here?

1766
01:44:30.930 --> 01:44:32.730
Under the Dauphin.

1767
01:44:32.730 --> 01:44:34.770
Thou hast made me giddy

1768
01:44:34.770 --> 01:44:37.070
With these ill tidings.

1769
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:38.200
Now, what says the world

1770
01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:40.770
To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff

1771
01:44:40.770 --> 01:44:43.200
My head with more ill news, for it is full.

1772
01:44:44.170 --> 01:44:45.870
But if you be afeard to hear the worst,

1773
01:44:45.870 --> 01:44:48.900
Then let the worst unheard fall on your head.

1774
01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:52.930
Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed

1775
01:44:52.930 --> 01:44:55.030
Under the tide: but now I breathe again

1776
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:58.270
Aloft the flood, and can give audience

1777
01:44:58.270 --> 01:45:01.100
To any tongue, speak it of what it will.

1778
01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:02.630
How I have sped among the clergymen,

1779
01:45:02.630 --> 01:45:04.800
The sums I have collected shall express.

1780
01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:07.070
But as I travell'd hither through the land,

1781
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:09.930
I find the people strangely fantasied;

1782
01:45:09.930 --> 01:45:11.030
Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,

1783
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:15.000
Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:

1784
01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.130
And here a prophet, that I brought with me

1785
01:45:17.130 --> 01:45:19.600
From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found

1786
01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.270
With many hundreds treading on his heels;

1787
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:24.470
To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,

1788
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:25.800
That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,

1789
01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:29.100
Your highness should deliver up your crown.

1790
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.800
Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?

1791
01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:41.600
Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.

1792
01:45:44.230 --> 01:45:49.230
Hubert, away with him; imprison him;

1793
01:45:49.230 --> 01:45:51.100
And on that day at noon whereon he says

1794
01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:54.700
I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd.

1795
01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:56.770
Deliver him to safety; and return,

1796
01:45:56.770 --> 01:46:01.100
For I must use thee.

1797
01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:03.800
O my gentle cousin,

1798
01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:06.600
Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?

1799
01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:09.700
The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:

1800
01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:13.130
Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,

1801
01:46:13.130 --> 01:46:15.170
With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,

1802
01:46:15.170 --> 01:46:16.430
And others more, going to seek the grave

1803
01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:18.800
Of Arthur, who they say is kill'd to-night

1804
01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:21.970
On your suggestion.

1805
01:46:21.970 --> 01:46:24.300
Gentle kinsman, go,

1806
01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:26.830
And thrust thyself into their companies:

1807
01:46:26.830 --> 01:46:29.270
I have a way to win their loves again;

1808
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:31.070
Bring them before me.

1809
01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:36.600
I will seek them out.

1810
01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:40.200
Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.

1811
01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:41.570
O, let me have no subject enemies,

1812
01:46:41.570 --> 01:46:43.770
When adverse foreigners affright my towns

1813
01:46:43.770 --> 01:46:45.900
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!

1814
01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:51.630
Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,

1815
01:46:51.630 --> 01:46:53.600
And fly like thought from them to me again.

1816
01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.530
The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.

1817
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:59.830
Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.

1818
01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:02.370
Go after him; for he perhaps shall need

1819
01:47:02.370 --> 01:47:03.900
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;

1820
01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:05.170
And be thou he.

1821
01:47:05.170 --> 01:47:06.730
With all my heart, my liege.

1822
01:47:06.730 --> 01:47:10.030
My mother dead!

1823
01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:14.900
My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;

1824
01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:16.670
Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about

1825
01:47:16.670 --> 01:47:19.330
The other four in wondrous motion.

1826
01:47:19.330 --> 01:47:21.000
Five moons!

1827
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.700
Old men and beldams in the streets

1828
01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:25.170
Do prophesy upon it dangerously:

1829
01:47:25.170 --> 01:47:27.900
Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:

1830
01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:30.500
And when they talk of him, they shake their heads

1831
01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:32.670
And whisper one another in the ear;

1832
01:47:32.670 --> 01:47:35.670
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,

1833
01:47:35.670 --> 01:47:38.230
Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,

1834
01:47:38.230 --> 01:47:42.000
With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.

1835
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.330
I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,

1836
01:47:44.330 --> 01:47:47.130
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,

1837
01:47:47.130 --> 01:47:49.830
With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;

1838
01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:52.270
Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,

1839
01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:53.870
Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste

1840
01:47:53.870 --> 01:47:56.500
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,

1841
01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:58.800
Told of a many thousand warlike French

1842
01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:01.800
That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:

1843
01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:03.830
Another lean unwash'd artificer

1844
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:07.730
Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.

1845
01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:15.800
Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?

1846
01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:18.630
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?

1847
01:48:18.630 --> 01:48:21.870
Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause

1848
01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:24.430
To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.

1849
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:26.770
No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?

1850
01:48:26.770 --> 01:48:29.470
It is the curse of kings to be attended

1851
01:48:29.470 --> 01:48:31.630
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant

1852
01:48:31.630 --> 01:48:35.130
To break within the bloody house of life,

1853
01:48:35.130 --> 01:48:36.100
And on the winking of authority

1854
01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:38.470
To understand a law, to know the meaning

1855
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:40.700
Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns

1856
01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:45.800
More upon humour than advised respect.

1857
01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:52.970
Here is your hand and seal for what I did.

1858
01:48:52.970 --> 01:48:56.170
O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth

1859
01:48:56.170 --> 01:48:58.930
Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal

1860
01:48:58.930 --> 01:49:03.670
Witness against us to damnation!

1861
01:49:03.670 --> 01:49:09.530
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds

1862
01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:13.730
Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,

1863
01:49:13.730 --> 01:49:16.500
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,

1864
01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:18.830
Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,

1865
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:23.730
This murder had not come into my mind:

1866
01:49:23.730 --> 01:49:27.330
But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,

1867
01:49:27.330 --> 01:49:29.470
Finding thee fit for bloody villany,

1868
01:49:29.470 --> 01:49:31.700
Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,

1869
01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:34.200
I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;

1870
01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:35.430
And thou, to be endeared to a king,

1871
01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:38.100
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.

1872
01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:39.070
My lord--

1873
01:49:39.070 --> 01:49:43.800
Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause

1874
01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:47.400
When I spake darkly what I purposed,

1875
01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:49.530
As bid me tell my tale in express words,

1876
01:49:49.530 --> 01:49:52.130
Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,

1877
01:49:52.130 --> 01:49:56.170
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:

1878
01:49:56.170 --> 01:50:00.530
But thou didst understand me by my signs

1879
01:50:00.530 --> 01:50:03.930
And didst in signs again parley with sin;

1880
01:50:03.930 --> 01:50:07.700
Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,

1881
01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:10.630
And consequently thy rude hand to act

1882
01:50:10.630 --> 01:50:14.200
The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.

1883
01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:18.130
Out of my sight, and never see me more!

1884
01:50:19.570 --> 01:50:22.730
My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,

1885
01:50:22.730 --> 01:50:25.770
Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:

1886
01:50:25.770 --> 01:50:28.370
Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,

1887
01:50:28.370 --> 01:50:31.730
This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,

1888
01:50:31.730 --> 01:50:34.230
Hostility and civil tumult reigns

1889
01:50:34.230 --> 01:50:38.570
Between my conscience and my cousin's death.

1890
01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:45.930
Arm you against your other enemies,

1891
01:50:45.930 --> 01:50:49.630
I'll make a peace between your soul and you.

1892
01:50:49.630 --> 01:50:53.830
Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine

1893
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:57.500
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,

1894
01:50:57.500 --> 01:51:00.830
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.

1895
01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:02.670
Within this bosom never enter'd yet

1896
01:51:02.670 --> 01:51:05.930
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;

1897
01:51:05.930 --> 01:51:08.870
And you have slander'd nature in my form,

1898
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:10.630
Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,

1899
01:51:10.630 --> 01:51:12.970
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind

1900
01:51:12.970 --> 01:51:19.300
Than to be butcher of an innocent child.

1901
01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:28.000
Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,

1902
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.800
Throw this report on their incensed rage,

1903
01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:32.000
And make them tame to their obedience!

1904
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.930
Forgive the comment that my anger made

1905
01:51:34.930 --> 01:51:37.530
Upon thy feature; for my passion was blind,

1906
01:51:37.530 --> 01:51:39.430
And foul imaginary eyes of blood

1907
01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:41.530
Presented thee more hideous than thou art.

1908
01:51:41.530 --> 01:51:44.470
O, answer not, but to my closet bring

1909
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:45.970
The angry lords with all expedient haste.

1910
01:51:45.970 --> 01:51:48.900
I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.

1911
01:52:11.530 --> 01:52:15.670
The wall is high, and yet will I leap down:

1912
01:52:15.670 --> 01:52:19.130
Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!

1913
01:52:19.130 --> 01:52:21.630
There's few or none do know me: if they did,

1914
01:52:21.630 --> 01:52:26.170
This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.

1915
01:52:29.230 --> 01:52:33.300
I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.

1916
01:52:33.670 --> 01:52:36.270
If I get down, and do not break my limbs,

1917
01:52:36.270 --> 01:52:38.730
I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:

1918
01:52:38.730 --> 01:52:44.130
As good to die and go, as die and stay.

1919
01:52:44.130 --> 01:52:50.830
(♪ suspenseful music)

1920
01:52:57.470 --> 01:53:02.970
O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:

1921
01:53:02.970 --> 01:53:08.230
Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!

1922
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:33.470
Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:

1923
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:36.670
It is our safety, and we must embrace

1924
01:53:36.670 --> 01:53:39.670
This gentle offer of the perilous time.

1925
01:53:39.670 --> 01:53:41.230
Who brought that letter from the cardinal?

1926
01:53:41.230 --> 01:53:44.130
The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,

1927
01:53:44.130 --> 01:53:46.100
Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love

1928
01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:48.600
Is much more general than these lines import.

1929
01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:51.100
To-morrow morning let us meet him then.

1930
01:53:51.100 --> 01:53:53.670
Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be

1931
01:53:53.670 --> 01:53:59.070
Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.

1932
01:53:59.070 --> 01:54:05.330
Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!

1933
01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:08.430
The king by me requests your presence straight.

1934
01:54:08.430 --> 01:54:13.230
The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:

1935
01:54:13.230 --> 01:54:15.030
We will not line his thin bestained cloak

1936
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:17.500
With our pure honours, nor attend the foot

1937
01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:19.800
That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.

1938
01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:22.930
Return and tell him so: we know the worst.

1939
01:54:22.930 --> 01:54:27.130
Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.

1940
01:54:27.130 --> 01:54:29.400
Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.

1941
01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:30.730
But there is little reason in your grief;

1942
01:54:30.730 --> 01:54:32.530
Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.

1943
01:54:32.530 --> 01:54:35.500
Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.

1944
01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:37.570
'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.

1945
01:54:37.570 --> 01:54:45.800
This is the prison. What is he lies here?

1946
01:54:57.870 --> 01:55:04.070
O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!

1947
01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:11.870
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.

1948
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:16.600
Murder, as hating what himself hath done,

1949
01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:20.100
Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.

1950
01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:23.500
Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,

1951
01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:27.870
Found it too precious-princely for a grave.

1952
01:55:27.870 --> 01:55:32.100
Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,

1953
01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:35.400
Or have you read or heard? or could you think?

1954
01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:38.300
Or do you almost think, although you see,

1955
01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:41.930
That you do see? could thought, without this object,

1956
01:55:41.930 --> 01:55:45.770
Form such another? This is the very top,

1957
01:55:45.770 --> 01:55:49.630
The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,

1958
01:55:49.630 --> 01:55:53.400
Of murder's arms: this is the wildest savagery,

1959
01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:54.530
the vilest stroke,

1960
01:55:54.530 --> 01:55:57.200
That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage

1961
01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:02.130
Presented to the tears of soft remorse.

1962
01:56:02.130 --> 01:56:08.400
All murders past do stand excused in this:

1963
01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:12.070
And this, so sole and so unmatchable,

1964
01:56:12.070 --> 01:56:15.100
Shall give a holiness, a purity,

1965
01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:18.500
To the yet unbegotten sin of times;

1966
01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:23.800
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,

1967
01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:28.970
Exampled by this heinous spectacle.

1968
01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:34.330
It is a damned and a bloody work;

1969
01:56:34.330 --> 01:56:37.970
The graceless action of a heavy hand,

1970
01:56:37.970 --> 01:56:41.530
If that it be the work of any hand.

1971
01:56:41.530 --> 01:56:44.670
If that it be the work of any hand!

1972
01:56:44.670 --> 01:56:46.530
We had a kind of light what would ensue:

1973
01:56:46.530 --> 01:56:49.000
It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;

1974
01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.630
The practise and the purpose of the king:

1975
01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:59.630
From whose obedience I forbid my soul,

1976
01:56:59.630 --> 01:57:03.500
Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,

1977
01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:05.670
And breathing to his breathless excellence

1978
01:57:05.670 --> 01:57:09.570
The incense of a vow, a holy vow,

1979
01:57:09.570 --> 01:57:11.330
Never to taste the pleasures of the world,

1980
01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:13.470
Never to be infected with delight,

1981
01:57:13.470 --> 01:57:16.530
Nor conversant with ease or idleness,

1982
01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:19.030
Till I have set a glory to this hand,

1983
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:23.100
By giving it the worship of revenge.

1984
01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:26.370
Our souls religiously confirm thy words.

1985
01:57:26.830 --> 01:57:32.170
Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:

1986
01:57:32.170 --> 01:57:35.930
Arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.

1987
01:57:37.630 --> 01:57:40.970
O, he is bold and blushes not at death.

1988
01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:43.330
Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!

1989
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:48.630
I am no villain.

1990
01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:51.730
Must I rob the law?

1991
01:57:51.730 --> 01:57:53.730
Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.

1992
01:57:53.730 --> 01:57:55.830
Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.

1993
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:58.600
Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;

1994
01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:02.170
By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours:

1995
01:58:02.170 --> 01:58:05.330
I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,

1996
01:58:05.330 --> 01:58:08.400
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;

1997
01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:11.300
Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget

1998
01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:15.730
Your worth, your greatness and nobility.

1999
01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.870
Out, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?

2000
01:58:18.870 --> 01:58:20.670
Not for my life: but yet I dare defend

2001
01:58:20.670 --> 01:58:22.970
My innocent life against an emperor.

2002
01:58:22.970 --> 01:58:24.300
Thou art a murderer.

2003
01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:26.800
Do not prove me so;

2004
01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:30.930
Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,

2005
01:58:30.930 --> 01:58:34.900
Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.

2006
01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:36.300
Cut him to pieces.

2007
01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:37.730
Keep the peace, I say.

2008
01:58:37.730 --> 01:58:40.030
Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.

2009
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:42.830
Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:

2010
01:58:42.830 --> 01:58:45.230
If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,

2011
01:58:45.230 --> 01:58:47.570
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,

2012
01:58:47.570 --> 01:58:53.830
I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;

2013
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:57.430
Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,

2014
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:59.130
That you shall think the devil is come from hell.

2015
01:58:59.130 --> 01:59:01.900
What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?

2016
01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:03.600
Second a villain and a murderer?

2017
01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:05.600
Lord Bigot, I am none.

2018
01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:07.670
Who kill'd this prince?

2019
01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:34.230
'Tis not an hour since I left him well:

2020
01:59:34.230 --> 01:59:41.570
I honour'd him, I loved him, and will weep

2021
01:59:41.570 --> 01:59:47.700
My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.

2022
01:59:52.630 --> 01:59:55.730
Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,

2023
01:59:55.730 --> 01:59:58.230
For villany is not without such rheum;

2024
01:59:58.230 --> 02:00:00.530
And he, long traded in it, makes it seem

2025
02:00:00.530 --> 02:00:03.370
Like rivers of remorse and innocency.

2026
02:00:03.370 --> 02:00:06.130
Away with me, all you whose souls abhor

2027
02:00:06.130 --> 02:00:09.200
The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;

2028
02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:12.900
For I am stifled with this smell of sin.

2029
02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:18.670
Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!

2030
02:00:19.530 --> 02:00:23.070
There tell the king he may inquire us out.

2031
02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:52.770
Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?

2032
02:00:52.770 --> 02:00:54.530
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach

2033
02:00:54.530 --> 02:00:56.870
Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,

2034
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:57.930
Art thou damn'd, Hubert.

2035
02:00:57.930 --> 02:00:58.870
Do but hear me, sir.

2036
02:00:58.870 --> 02:01:01.600
Ha! I'll tell thee what;

2037
02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:06.870
Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black;

2038
02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:09.870
Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:

2039
02:01:09.870 --> 02:01:12.330
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell

2040
02:01:12.330 --> 02:01:14.100
As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.

2041
02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:15.100
Upon my soul--

2042
02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:17.800
If thou didst but consent

2043
02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:26.930
To this most cruel act, do but despair;

2044
02:01:26.930 --> 02:01:29.070
And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread

2045
02:01:29.070 --> 02:01:30.770
That ever spider twisted from her womb

2046
02:01:30.770 --> 02:01:34.030
Will serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam

2047
02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:36.930
To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,

2048
02:01:36.930 --> 02:01:38.200
Put but a little water in a spoon,

2049
02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:40.570
And it shall be as all the ocean,

2050
02:01:40.570 --> 02:01:44.630
Enough to stifle such a villain up.

2051
02:01:44.630 --> 02:01:48.370
I do suspect thee very grievously.

2052
02:01:48.370 --> 02:01:55.700
If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,

2053
02:01:55.700 --> 02:01:58.670
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath

2054
02:01:58.670 --> 02:02:03.530
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,

2055
02:02:03.530 --> 02:02:06.770
Let hell want pains enough to torture me.

2056
02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:08.770
I left him well.

2057
02:02:11.370 --> 02:02:18.170
Go, bear him in thine arms.

2058
02:02:18.170 --> 02:02:20.930
I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way

2059
02:02:20.930 --> 02:02:24.970
Among the thorns and dangers of this world.

2060
02:02:25.870 --> 02:02:30.570
How easy dost thou take all England up!

2061
02:02:30.570 --> 02:02:33.830
From forth this morsel of dead royalty,

2062
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:36.500
The life, the right and truth of all this realm

2063
02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:38.570
Is fled to heaven; and England now is left

2064
02:02:38.570 --> 02:02:40.900
To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth

2065
02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:46.830
The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.

2066
02:02:46.830 --> 02:02:49.370
Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty

2067
02:02:49.370 --> 02:02:52.300
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest

2068
02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:54.100
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:

2069
02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:57.100
Now powers from home and discontents at home

2070
02:02:57.100 --> 02:03:00.730
Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,

2071
02:03:00.730 --> 02:03:02.630
As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,

2072
02:03:02.630 --> 02:03:07.200
The imminent decay of wrested pomp.

2073
02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:08.570
Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can

2074
02:03:08.570 --> 02:03:10.570
Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child

2075
02:03:10.570 --> 02:03:13.070
And follow me with speed: I'll to the king:

2076
02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:14.800
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,

2077
02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:17.230
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.

2078
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:20.970
(♪singing)

2079
02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:25.630
Thus have I yielded up into your hand

2080
02:03:25.630 --> 02:03:28.400
The circle of my glory.

2081
02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:33.900
Take again, from this my hand, as holding of the pope

2082
02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:38.500
Your sovereign greatness and authority.

2083
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:50.670
Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,

2084
02:03:50.670 --> 02:03:52.570
And from his holiness use all your power

2085
02:03:52.570 --> 02:03:56.030
To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.

2086
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:58.470
Our discontented counties do revolt;

2087
02:03:58.470 --> 02:04:00.500
Our people quarrel with obedience,

2088
02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:02.330
Swearing allegiance and the love of soul

2089
02:04:02.330 --> 02:04:05.770
To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.

2090
02:04:05.770 --> 02:04:07.930
This inundation of mistemper'd humour

2091
02:04:07.930 --> 02:04:10.870
Rests by you only to be qualified:

2092
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:14.330
Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,

2093
02:04:14.330 --> 02:04:17.030
That present medicine must be minister'd,

2094
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:20.500
Or overthrow incurable ensues.

2095
02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:24.670
It was my breath that blew this tempest up,

2096
02:04:24.670 --> 02:04:28.500
Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;

2097
02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:30.830
But now you are a gentle convertite,

2098
02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:34.600
My tongue shall hush again this storm of war

2099
02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:38.700
And make fair weather in your blustering land.

2100
02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:43.300
On this Ascension-day, remember well,

2101
02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:47.500
Upon your oath of service to the pope,

2102
02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:51.500
Go I to make the French lay down their arms.

2103
02:05:03.070 --> 02:05:06.170
Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet

2104
02:05:06.170 --> 02:05:08.400
Say that before Ascension-day at noon

2105
02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:13.900
My crown I should give off? Even so I have:

2106
02:05:13.900 --> 02:05:16.300
I did suppose it should be on constraint:

2107
02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:19.200
But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary.

2108
02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:22.230
All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out

2109
02:05:22.230 --> 02:05:23.830
But Dover castle: London hath received,

2110
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:26.270
Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers:

2111
02:05:26.270 --> 02:05:27.630
Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone

2112
02:05:27.630 --> 02:05:29.270
To offer service to your enemy,

2113
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:30.500
And wild amazement hurries up and down

2114
02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:34.270
The little number of your doubtful friends.

2115
02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:37.430
Would not my lords return to me again,

2116
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:39.770
After they heard young Arthur was alive?

2117
02:05:39.770 --> 02:05:41.700
They found him dead and cast into the streets,

2118
02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:43.400
An empty casket, where the jewel of life

2119
02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:46.030
By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.

2120
02:05:46.030 --> 02:05:48.430
That villain Hubert told me he did live.

2121
02:05:48.430 --> 02:05:52.270
So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.

2122
02:05:59.870 --> 02:06:04.400
But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?

2123
02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:09.030
Be great in act, as you have been in thought;

2124
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:12.100
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust

2125
02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:14.100
Govern the motion of a kingly eye:

2126
02:06:14.100 --> 02:06:16.630
Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;

2127
02:06:16.630 --> 02:06:18.530
Threaten the threatener and outface the brow

2128
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:20.970
Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,

2129
02:06:20.970 --> 02:06:23.300
That borrow their behaviors from the great,

2130
02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:25.500
Grow great by your example and put on

2131
02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:28.100
The dauntless spirit of resolution.

2132
02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:30.700
Away, and glister like the god of war,

2133
02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:33.330
When he intendeth to become the field:

2134
02:06:33.330 --> 02:06:42.670
Show boldness and aspiring confidence.

2135
02:06:42.670 --> 02:06:49.370
What, shall they seek the lion in his den,

2136
02:06:49.370 --> 02:06:53.600
And fright him there? and make him tremble there?

2137
02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:57.500
O, let it not be said: forage, and run

2138
02:06:57.500 --> 02:06:59.500
To meet displeasure farther from the doors,

2139
02:06:59.500 --> 02:07:02.170
And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.

2140
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:10.330
The legate of the pope hath been with me,

2141
02:07:10.330 --> 02:07:14.200
And I have made a happy peace with him;

2142
02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:16.470
And he hath promised to dismiss the powers

2143
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:20.200
Led by the Dauphin.

2144
02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:26.070
O inglorious league!

2145
02:07:26.070 --> 02:07:30.100
Shall we, upon the footing of our land,

2146
02:07:30.100 --> 02:07:32.600
Send fair-play orders and make compromise,

2147
02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:35.730
Insinuation, parley and base truce

2148
02:07:35.730 --> 02:07:39.270
To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,

2149
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:42.930
A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,

2150
02:07:42.930 --> 02:07:45.070
And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,

2151
02:07:45.070 --> 02:07:46.930
Mocking the air with colours idly spread,

2152
02:07:46.930 --> 02:07:51.400
And find no cheque? Let us, my liege, to arms:

2153
02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:54.200
Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;

2154
02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:56.130
Or if he do, let it at least be said

2155
02:07:56.130 --> 02:07:59.570
They saw we had a purpose of defence.

2156
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:18.930
Have thou the ordering of this present time.

2157
02:08:19.700 --> 02:08:32.000
Away, then, with good courage! yet, I know,

2158
02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:33.930
Our party may well meet a prouder foe.

2159
02:08:33.930 --> 02:08:37.300
(♪music to end scene)

2160
02:08:40.170 --> 02:08:46.470


2161
02:08:56.630 --> 02:08:59.300
My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,

2162
02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:01.430
And keep it safe for our remembrance:

2163
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:04.230
Return the precedent to these lords again;

2164
02:09:04.230 --> 02:09:06.300
That, having our fair order written down,

2165
02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:10.100
Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,

2166
02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:12.800
May know wherefore we took the sacrament

2167
02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:15.470
And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.

2168
02:09:15.470 --> 02:09:18.000
Upon our sides it never shall be broken.

2169
02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.230
And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear

2170
02:09:21.230 --> 02:09:23.000
A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith

2171
02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.370
To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,

2172
02:09:26.370 --> 02:09:29.300
I am not glad that such a sore of time

2173
02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:31.970
Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,

2174
02:09:31.970 --> 02:09:34.330
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound

2175
02:09:34.330 --> 02:09:39.000
By making many. O, it grieves my soul,

2176
02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.870
That I must draw this metal from my side

2177
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:47.230
To be a widow-maker! O, and there

2178
02:09:47.230 --> 02:09:49.770
Where honourable rescue and defence

2179
02:09:49.770 --> 02:09:54.430
Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!

2180
02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:58.870
But such is the infection of the time,

2181
02:09:58.870 --> 02:10:00.670
That, for the health and physic of our right,

2182
02:10:00.670 --> 02:10:02.470
We cannot deal but with the very hand

2183
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:07.270
Of stern injustice and confused wrong.

2184
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:09.270
And is't not pity, O my grieved friends,

2185
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:12.470
That we, the sons and children of this isle,

2186
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:15.570
Were born to see so sad an hour as this;

2187
02:10:15.570 --> 02:10:18.100
Wherein we step after a stranger march

2188
02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:22.300
Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up

2189
02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:28.500
Her enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weep

2190
02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:34.130
Upon the spot of this enforced cause,--

2191
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:39.000
To grace the gentry of a land remote,

2192
02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:42.630
And follow unacquainted colours here?

2193
02:10:42.630 --> 02:10:48.130
What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!

2194
02:10:48.130 --> 02:10:50.930
That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,

2195
02:10:50.930 --> 02:10:53.070
Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,

2196
02:10:53.070 --> 02:10:56.430
And grapple thee unto a pagan shore;

2197
02:10:56.430 --> 02:10:59.270
Where these two Christian armies might combine

2198
02:10:59.270 --> 02:11:03.030
The blood of malice in a vein of league,

2199
02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:07.500
And not to spend it so unneighbourly!

2200
02:11:14.770 --> 02:11:17.730
A noble temper dost thou show in this;

2201
02:11:17.730 --> 02:11:20.570
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom

2202
02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:24.100
Doth make an earthquake of nobility.

2203
02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:26.800
O, what a noble combat hast thou fought

2204
02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:32.170
Between compulsion and a brave respect!

2205
02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:40.230
Let me wipe off this honourable dew,

2206
02:11:40.230 --> 02:11:43.530
That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:

2207
02:11:43.530 --> 02:11:47.230
My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,

2208
02:11:47.230 --> 02:11:48.600
Being an ordinary inundation;

2209
02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:51.530
But this effusion of such manly drops,

2210
02:11:51.530 --> 02:11:56.730
This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,

2211
02:11:56.730 --> 02:12:01.130
Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed

2212
02:12:01.130 --> 02:12:02.930
Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven

2213
02:12:02.930 --> 02:12:08.800
Figured quite o'er with burning meteors.

2214
02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:13.570
Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,

2215
02:12:13.570 --> 02:12:16.870
And with a great heart heave away the storm:

2216
02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:19.930
Commend these waters to those baby eyes

2217
02:12:19.930 --> 02:12:22.270
That never saw the giant world enraged;

2218
02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:24.900
Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,

2219
02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:27.700
Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.

2220
02:12:27.700 --> 02:12:34.200
Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep

2221
02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:37.370
Into the purse of rich prosperity

2222
02:12:37.370 --> 02:12:43.070
As Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,

2223
02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:47.570
That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.

2224
02:12:47.570 --> 02:12:50.030
And even there, methinks, an angel spake:

2225
02:12:50.030 --> 02:12:54.130
(♪chanting)

2226
02:12:54.130 --> 02:12:56.370
Look, where the holy legate comes apace,

2227
02:12:56.370 --> 02:12:58.230
To give us warrant from the hand of heaven

2228
02:12:58.230 --> 02:13:00.470
And on our actions set the name of right

2229
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:02.230
With holy breath.

2230
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:08.400
Hail, noble prince of France!

2231
02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:11.800
The next is this, King John hath reconciled

2232
02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:15.430
Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,

2233
02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:18.700
That so stood out against the holy church,

2234
02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:21.470
The great metropolis and see of Rome:

2235
02:13:21.470 --> 02:13:25.030
Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up;

2236
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:29.200
And tame the savage spirit of wild war,

2237
02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:30.800
That like a lion foster'd up at hand,

2238
02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:34.200
It may lie gently at the foot of peace,

2239
02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:37.730
And be no further harmful than in show.

2240
02:13:40.900 --> 02:13:44.500
Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:

2241
02:13:47.770 --> 02:13:52.030
I am too high-born to be propertied,

2242
02:13:52.030 --> 02:13:53.370
To be a secondary at control,

2243
02:13:53.370 --> 02:13:55.400
Or useful serving-man and instrument,

2244
02:13:55.400 --> 02:14:00.070
To any sovereign state throughout the world.

2245
02:14:00.070 --> 02:14:03.400
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars

2246
02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:05.830
Between this chastised kingdom and myself,

2247
02:14:05.830 --> 02:14:09.230
And brought in matter that should feed this fire;

2248
02:14:09.230 --> 02:14:11.570
And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out

2249
02:14:11.570 --> 02:14:13.130
With that same weak wind which enkindled it.

2250
02:14:13.130 --> 02:14:18.970
You taught me how to know the face of right,

2251
02:14:18.970 --> 02:14:21.030
Acquainted me with interest to this land,

2252
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:24.570
Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;

2253
02:14:24.570 --> 02:14:26.200
And come ye now to tell me John hath made

2254
02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:31.430
His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?

2255
02:14:32.730 --> 02:14:34.730
I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,

2256
02:14:34.730 --> 02:14:36.730
After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;

2257
02:14:36.730 --> 02:14:38.500
And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back

2258
02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:41.100
Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?

2259
02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:44.970
Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,

2260
02:14:44.970 --> 02:14:46.670
What men provided, what munition sent,

2261
02:14:46.670 --> 02:14:48.800
To underprop this action? Is't not I

2262
02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:50.900
That undergo this charge? who else but I,

2263
02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:53.470
And such as to my claim are liable,

2264
02:14:53.470 --> 02:14:57.330
Sweat in this business and maintain this war?

2265
02:14:57.330 --> 02:14:58.500
Have I not heard these islanders shout out

2266
02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:01.870
'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?

2267
02:15:01.870 --> 02:15:04.770
Have I not here the best cards for the game,

2268
02:15:04.770 --> 02:15:08.000
To win this easy match play'd for a crown?

2269
02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:15.570
And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?

2270
02:15:15.570 --> 02:15:20.200
No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.

2271
02:15:21.230 --> 02:15:24.200
You look but on the outside of this work.

2272
02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:26.670
Outside or inside, I will not return

2273
02:15:26.670 --> 02:15:28.330
Till my attempt so much be glorified

2274
02:15:28.330 --> 02:15:30.370
As to my ample hope was promised

2275
02:15:30.370 --> 02:15:32.970
Before I drew this gallant head of war,

2276
02:15:32.970 --> 02:15:36.000
And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,

2277
02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:40.330
To outlook conquest and to win renown

2278
02:15:40.330 --> 02:15:43.330
Even in the jaws of danger and of death.

2279
02:15:43.330 --> 02:15:45.700
(♪Trumpets)

2280
02:15:46.330 --> 02:15:49.400
What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?

2281
02:15:55.770 --> 02:15:56.970
According to the fair play of the world,

2282
02:15:56.970 --> 02:16:01.400
Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:

2283
02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:03.670
My holy lord of Milan, from the king

2284
02:16:03.670 --> 02:16:07.570
I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;

2285
02:16:07.570 --> 02:16:09.100
And, as you answer, I do know the scope

2286
02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:13.230
And warrant limited unto my tongue.

2287
02:16:16.100 --> 02:16:20.370
The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,

2288
02:16:20.370 --> 02:16:24.870
And will not temporize with my entreaties;

2289
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:29.870
He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.

2290
02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:31.470
By all the blood that ever fury breathed,

2291
02:16:31.470 --> 02:16:37.270
The youth says well. Now hear our English king;

2292
02:16:37.270 --> 02:16:40.430
For thus his royalty doth speak in me.

2293
02:16:40.430 --> 02:16:45.470
He is prepared, and reason too he should:

2294
02:16:45.470 --> 02:16:48.500
This apish and unmannerly approach,

2295
02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:51.470
This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,

2296
02:16:51.470 --> 02:16:53.870
This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,

2297
02:16:53.870 --> 02:16:56.770
The king doth smile at; and is well prepared

2298
02:16:56.770 --> 02:16:59.070
To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,

2299
02:16:59.070 --> 02:17:02.430
From out the circle of his territories.

2300
02:17:03.470 --> 02:17:06.330
That hand which had the strength, even at your door,

2301
02:17:06.330 --> 02:17:08.930
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,

2302
02:17:08.930 --> 02:17:12.100
To dive like buckets in concealed wells,

2303
02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:15.370
To crouch in litter of your stable planks,

2304
02:17:15.370 --> 02:17:17.630
To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,

2305
02:17:17.630 --> 02:17:20.700
To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out

2306
02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:22.970
In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake

2307
02:17:22.970 --> 02:17:24.670
Even at the crying of your nation's crow,

2308
02:17:24.670 --> 02:17:26.530
Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;

2309
02:17:26.530 --> 02:17:28.830
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,

2310
02:17:28.830 --> 02:17:30.730
That in your chambers gave you chastisement?

2311
02:17:30.730 --> 02:17:35.030
No: know the gallant monarch is in arms

2312
02:17:35.030 --> 02:17:37.300
And like an eagle o'er his aery towers,

2313
02:17:37.300 --> 02:17:40.470
To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.

2314
02:17:40.470 --> 02:17:45.300
And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,

2315
02:17:45.300 --> 02:17:48.300
You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb

2316
02:17:48.300 --> 02:17:51.800
Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;

2317
02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:53.630
For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids

2318
02:17:53.630 --> 02:17:56.130
Like Amazons come tripping after drums,

2319
02:17:56.130 --> 02:17:58.200
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,

2320
02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:00.070
Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts

2321
02:18:00.070 --> 02:18:02.900
To fierce and bloody inclination.

2322
02:18:02.900 --> 02:18:07.070
There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;

2323
02:18:07.070 --> 02:18:11.270
We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;

2324
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:13.670
We hold our time too precious to be spent

2325
02:18:13.670 --> 02:18:15.200
With such a brabbler.

2326
02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:16.400
Give me leave to speak.

2327
02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:18.570
No, I will speak.

2328
02:18:18.570 --> 02:18:19.670
We will attend to neither.

2329
02:18:19.670 --> 02:18:21.900
Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war

2330
02:18:21.900 --> 02:18:24.870
Plead for our interest and our being here.

2331
02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:27.830
Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;

2332
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:32.270
And so shall you, being beaten: do but start

2333
02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:33.700
An echo with the clamour of thy drum,

2334
02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:35.630
And even at hand a drum is ready braced

2335
02:18:35.630 --> 02:18:38.200
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;

2336
02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:39.800
Sound but another, and another shall

2337
02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:41.630
As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear

2338
02:18:41.630 --> 02:18:43.470
And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,

2339
02:18:43.470 --> 02:18:47.200
Not trusting to this halting legate here,

2340
02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:49.870
Whom he hath used rather for sport than need

2341
02:18:49.870 --> 02:18:52.400
Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits

2342
02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:55.330
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day

2343
02:18:55.330 --> 02:18:59.030
To feast upon whole thousands of the French.

2344
02:18:59.030 --> 02:19:03.070
Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.

2345
02:19:03.070 --> 02:19:06.300
And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.

2346
02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:11.970
(♪drums pound)

2347
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:17.130
How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.

2348
02:19:17.130 --> 02:19:20.800
Badly, I fear. How fares your majesty?

2349
02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:24.130
This fever, that hath troubled me so long,

2350
02:19:24.130 --> 02:19:28.330
Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!

2351
02:19:28.330 --> 02:19:30.470
My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,

2352
02:19:30.470 --> 02:19:32.630
Desires your majesty to leave the field

2353
02:19:32.630 --> 02:19:34.930
And send him word by me which way you go.

2354
02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:40.030
Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.

2355
02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:41.900
Be of good comfort; for the great supply

2356
02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:43.730
That was expected by the Dauphin here,

2357
02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:47.470
Are wreck'd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands.

2358
02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:49.900
This news was brought to Richard but even now:

2359
02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:55.800
The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.

2360
02:19:55.800 --> 02:19:58.570
Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up,

2361
02:19:58.570 --> 02:20:00.630
And will not let me welcome this good news.

2362
02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:09.000
Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight;

2363
02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:15.030
Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.

2364
02:20:21.470 --> 02:20:25.330
I did not think the king so stored with friends.

2365
02:20:25.330 --> 02:20:28.100
Up once again; put spirit in the French:

2366
02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:30.370
If they miscarry, we miscarry too.

2367
02:20:30.370 --> 02:20:33.200
That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,

2368
02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:36.670
In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.

2369
02:20:36.670 --> 02:20:38.830
They say King John sore sick hath left the field.

2370
02:20:38.830 --> 02:20:40.800
Lead me to the revolts of England here.

2371
02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:43.600
When we were happy we had other names.

2372
02:20:43.600 --> 02:20:47.130
It is the Count Melun.

2373
02:20:47.130 --> 02:20:48.330
Wounded to death.

2374
02:20:48.330 --> 02:20:53.830
Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;

2375
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:55.400
Unthread the rude eye of rebellion

2376
02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:58.570
And welcome home again discarded faith.

2377
02:20:58.570 --> 02:21:01.030
Seek out King John and fall before his feet;

2378
02:21:01.030 --> 02:21:04.600
For if the French be lords of this loud day,

2379
02:21:04.600 --> 02:21:07.670
He means to recompense the pains you take

2380
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:11.170
By cutting off your heads: thus hath he sworn

2381
02:21:11.170 --> 02:21:13.470
And I with him, and many moe with me,

2382
02:21:13.470 --> 02:21:15.370
Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;

2383
02:21:15.370 --> 02:21:17.800
Even on that altar where we swore to you

2384
02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:20.630
Dear amity and everlasting love.

2385
02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:24.970
May this be possible? may this be true?

2386
02:21:24.970 --> 02:21:28.270
Have I not hideous death within my view,

2387
02:21:28.270 --> 02:21:32.000
Retaining but a quantity of life,

2388
02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.730
Which bleeds away, even as a form of wax

2389
02:21:34.730 --> 02:21:39.400
Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?

2390
02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:43.770
What in the world should make me now deceive,

2391
02:21:43.770 --> 02:21:47.570
Since I must lose the use of all deceit?

2392
02:21:47.570 --> 02:21:50.500
Why should I then be false, since it is true

2393
02:21:50.500 --> 02:21:56.170
That I must die here and live hence by truth?

2394
02:21:56.170 --> 02:21:59.230
I say again, if Lewis do win the day,

2395
02:21:59.230 --> 02:22:02.800
He is forsworn, if e'er those eyes of yours

2396
02:22:02.800 --> 02:22:06.630
Behold another day break in the east:

2397
02:22:09.500 --> 02:22:12.770
But even this night, whose black contagious breath

2398
02:22:12.770 --> 02:22:14.600
Already smokes about the burning crest

2399
02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:17.300
Of the old, feeble and day-wearied sun,

2400
02:22:17.300 --> 02:22:23.330
Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,

2401
02:22:23.330 --> 02:22:26.230
Paying the fine of rated treachery

2402
02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:28.330
Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,

2403
02:22:28.330 --> 02:22:34.000
If Lewis by your assistance win the day.

2404
02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:39.630
Commend me to one Hubert with your king:

2405
02:22:39.630 --> 02:22:41.170
The love of him, and this respect besides,

2406
02:22:41.170 --> 02:22:45.700
For that my grandsire was an Englishman,

2407
02:22:45.700 --> 02:22:51.500
Awakes my conscience to confess all this.

2408
02:22:51.500 --> 02:22:55.930
In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence

2409
02:22:55.930 --> 02:23:00.530
From forth the noise and rumour of the field,

2410
02:23:00.530 --> 02:23:03.270
Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts

2411
02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:08.570
In peace, and part this body and my soul

2412
02:23:08.570 --> 02:23:14.070
With contemplation and devout desires.

2413
02:23:14.070 --> 02:23:17.900
We do believe thee: and beshrew my soul

2414
02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:19.500
But I do love the favour and the form

2415
02:23:19.500 --> 02:23:22.530
Of this most fair occasion, by the which

2416
02:23:22.530 --> 02:23:25.670
We will untread the steps of damned flight,

2417
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:26.830
And like a bated and retired flood,

2418
02:23:26.830 --> 02:23:30.000
Leaving our rankness and irregular course,

2419
02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.830
Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd

2420
02:23:32.830 --> 02:23:35.770
And cabby run on in obedience

2421
02:23:35.770 --> 02:23:39.700
Even to our ocean, to our great King John.

2422
02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:43.470
My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;

2423
02:23:43.470 --> 02:23:45.130
For I do see the cruel pangs of death

2424
02:23:45.130 --> 02:23:50.400
Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;

2425
02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:54.430
And happy newness, that intends old right.

2426
02:23:55.800 --> 02:23:58.330
The sun of heaven methought was loath to set,

2427
02:23:58.330 --> 02:24:00.830
But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,

2428
02:24:00.830 --> 02:24:02.800
When English measure backward their own ground

2429
02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:06.330
In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,

2430
02:24:06.330 --> 02:24:08.370
When with a volley of our needless shot,

2431
02:24:08.370 --> 02:24:11.770
After such bloody toil, we bid good night;

2432
02:24:11.770 --> 02:24:14.230
And wound our tattering colours clearly up,

2433
02:24:14.230 --> 02:24:17.870
Last in the field, and almost lords of it!

2434
02:24:17.870 --> 02:24:19.830
Where is my prince, the Dauphin?

2435
02:24:19.830 --> 02:24:21.470
Here: what news?

2436
02:24:21.470 --> 02:24:23.730
The Count Melun is slain; the English lords

2437
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:35.400
by his persuasion are again fall'n off,

2438
02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:38.130
And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,

2439
02:24:38.130 --> 02:24:41.170
Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.

2440
02:24:46.730 --> 02:24:52.400
Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!

2441
02:24:54.400 --> 02:24:56.970
I did not think to be so sad to-night

2442
02:24:56.970 --> 02:25:02.370
As this hath made me. Who was he that said

2443
02:25:02.370 --> 02:25:04.870
King John did fly an hour or two before

2444
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:07.300
The stumbling night did part our weary powers?

2445
02:25:07.300 --> 02:25:10.070
Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.

2446
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:15.330
Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:

2447
02:25:15.330 --> 02:25:17.900
The day shall not be up so soon as I,

2448
02:25:17.900 --> 02:25:20.400
To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.

2449
02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:23.700
(♪horns)

2450
02:25:39.630 --> 02:25:42.670
Who's there? speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.

2451
02:25:42.670 --> 02:25:44.070
A friend. What art thou?

2452
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:46.200
Of the part of England.

2453
02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:47.400
Whither dost thou go?

2454
02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:49.670
What's that to thee? why may not I demand

2455
02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:51.700
Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?

2456
02:25:51.700 --> 02:25:54.270
Hubert, I think?

2457
02:25:54.270 --> 02:25:56.370
Thou hast a perfect thought:

2458
02:25:56.370 --> 02:25:57.900
I will upon all hazards well believe

2459
02:25:57.900 --> 02:26:00.370
Thou art my friend, that know'st my tongue so well.

2460
02:26:00.370 --> 02:26:01.800
Who art thou?

2461
02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:04.130
Who thou wilt: and if thou please,

2462
02:26:04.130 --> 02:26:06.000
Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think

2463
02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:09.370
I come one way of the Plantagenets.

2464
02:26:09.370 --> 02:26:13.330
Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night

2465
02:26:13.330 --> 02:26:15.970
Have done me shame: brave soldier, pardon me,

2466
02:26:15.970 --> 02:26:17.830
That any accent breaking from thy tongue

2467
02:26:17.830 --> 02:26:19.830
Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.

2468
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:22.730
Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?

2469
02:26:22.730 --> 02:26:24.730
Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,

2470
02:26:24.730 --> 02:26:27.770
To find you out.

2471
02:26:27.770 --> 02:26:29.600
Brief, then; and what's the news?

2472
02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:32.100
O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,

2473
02:26:32.100 --> 02:26:36.630
Black, fearful, comfortless and horrible.

2474
02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:37.900
Show me the very wound of this ill news:

2475
02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:39.970
I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it.

2476
02:26:39.970 --> 02:26:43.900
The king, I fear, is poison'd by a monk:

2477
02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:46.800
I left him almost speechless; and broke out

2478
02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:48.230
To acquaint you with this evil, that you might

2479
02:26:48.230 --> 02:26:49.770
The better arm you to the sudden time,

2480
02:26:49.770 --> 02:26:53.330
Than if you had at leisure known of this.

2481
02:26:53.330 --> 02:26:55.700
How did he take it? who did taste to him?

2482
02:26:55.700 --> 02:26:59.330
A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,

2483
02:26:59.330 --> 02:27:02.400
Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king

2484
02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:06.370
Yet speaks and peradventure may recover.

2485
02:27:06.770 --> 02:27:09.470
Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?

2486
02:27:09.470 --> 02:27:14.300
Why, know you not? the lords are all come back,

2487
02:27:14.300 --> 02:27:16.200
And brought Prince Henry in their company;

2488
02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:18.570
At whose request the king hath pardon'd them,

2489
02:27:18.570 --> 02:27:22.170
And they are all about his majesty.

2490
02:27:22.170 --> 02:27:28.500
Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,

2491
02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:32.370
And tempt us not to bear above our power!

2492
02:27:32.370 --> 02:27:35.930
I'll tell tree, Hubert, half my power this night,

2493
02:27:35.930 --> 02:27:39.970
Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;

2494
02:27:39.970 --> 02:27:43.000
These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;

2495
02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:48.800
Myself, well mounted, hardly have escaped.

2496
02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:50.770
Away before: conduct me to the king;

2497
02:27:50.770 --> 02:27:53.770
I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.

2498
02:27:57.930 --> 02:28:08.030
(♪ bells and chanting

2499
02:28:08.030 --> 02:28:16.370
(♪ bells and chanting

2500
02:28:16.370 --> 02:28:19.270
It is too late: the life of all his blood

2501
02:28:19.270 --> 02:28:23.770
Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,

2502
02:28:23.770 --> 02:28:26.370
Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,

2503
02:28:26.370 --> 02:28:28.700
Doth by the idle comments that it makes

2504
02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:31.300
Foretell the ending of mortality.

2505
02:28:31.300 --> 02:28:33.930
His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief

2506
02:28:33.930 --> 02:28:34.900
That, being brought into the open air,

2507
02:28:34.900 --> 02:28:37.070
It would allay the burning quality

2508
02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:41.470
Of that fell poison which assaileth him.

2509
02:28:41.470 --> 02:28:45.130
Let him be brought into the orchard here.

2510
02:28:46.430 --> 02:28:47.870
Doth he still rage?

2511
02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:50.170
He is more patient

2512
02:28:50.170 --> 02:28:54.000
Than when you left him; even now he sung.

2513
02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.530
O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes

2514
02:28:55.530 --> 02:29:00.400
In their continuance will not feel themselves.

2515
02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:02.530
Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,

2516
02:29:02.530 --> 02:29:06.070
Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now

2517
02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:10.400
Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds

2518
02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:13.000
With many legions of strange fantasies,

2519
02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:16.930
Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,

2520
02:29:16.930 --> 02:29:22.670
Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death

2521
02:29:22.670 --> 02:29:24.470
should sing.

2522
02:29:24.470 --> 02:29:27.330
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,

2523
02:29:27.330 --> 02:29:30.430
Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,

2524
02:29:30.430 --> 02:29:33.030
And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings

2525
02:29:33.030 --> 02:29:36.000
His soul and body to their lasting rest.

2526
02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.470
Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born

2527
02:29:38.470 --> 02:29:40.500
To set a form upon that indigest

2528
02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:44.430
Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.

2529
02:29:45.630 --> 02:29:52.100
(♪chanting)

2530
02:29:53.330 --> 02:29:58.670
Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;

2531
02:29:58.670 --> 02:30:04.400
It would not out at windows nor at doors.

2532
02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:08.800
There is so hot a summer in my bosom,

2533
02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:12.830
That all my bowels crumble up to dust:

2534
02:30:12.830 --> 02:30:18.100
I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen

2535
02:30:18.100 --> 02:30:24.270
Upon a parchment, and against this fire

2536
02:30:24.270 --> 02:30:26.100
Do I shrink up.

2537
02:30:26.100 --> 02:30:29.470
How fares your majesty?

2538
02:30:29.670 --> 02:30:38.930
Poison'd,--ill fare--dead, forsook, cast off:

2539
02:30:38.930 --> 02:30:41.730
And none of you will bid the winter come

2540
02:30:41.730 --> 02:30:45.900
To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,

2541
02:30:45.900 --> 02:30:49.400
Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course

2542
02:30:49.400 --> 02:30:53.430
Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north

2543
02:30:53.430 --> 02:30:58.370
To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips

2544
02:30:58.370 --> 02:31:03.430
And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,

2545
02:31:03.430 --> 02:31:09.400
I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait

2546
02:31:09.400 --> 02:31:12.300
And so ingrateful, you deny me that.

2547
02:31:12.300 --> 02:31:14.030
O that there were some virtue in my tears,

2548
02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:16.230
That might relieve you!

2549
02:31:16.230 --> 02:31:21.500
The salt in them is hot.

2550
02:31:21.500 --> 02:31:28.070
Within me is a hell; and there the poison

2551
02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:31.930
Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize

2552
02:31:31.930 --> 02:31:37.370
On unreprievable condemned blood.

2553
02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:41.030
O, I am scalded with my violent motion,

2554
02:31:41.030 --> 02:31:44.000
And spleen of speed to see your majesty!

2555
02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:50.200
O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:

2556
02:31:50.200 --> 02:31:57.600
The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,

2557
02:31:57.600 --> 02:32:01.970
And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail

2558
02:32:01.970 --> 02:32:08.130
Are turned to one hair, one little thread:

2559
02:32:08.130 --> 02:32:13.730
My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,

2560
02:32:13.730 --> 02:32:18.100
Which holds but till thy news be uttered;

2561
02:32:18.100 --> 02:32:22.930
And then all this thou seest is but a clod

2562
02:32:22.930 --> 02:32:27.970
And module of confounded royalty.

2563
02:32:27.970 --> 02:32:30.300
The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,

2564
02:32:30.300 --> 02:32:33.100
Where God He knows how we shall answer him;

2565
02:32:33.100 --> 02:32:34.930
For in a night the best part of my power,

2566
02:32:34.930 --> 02:32:36.600
As I upon advantage did remove,

2567
02:32:36.600 --> 02:32:37.970
Were in the Washes all unwarily

2568
02:32:37.970 --> 02:32:40.270
Devoured by the unexpected flood.

2569
02:32:47.230 --> 02:32:52.230
You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.

2570
02:32:52.230 --> 02:32:58.570
My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.

2571
02:32:58.570 --> 02:33:05.130
Even so must I run on, and even so stop.

2572
02:33:05.770 --> 02:33:10.570
What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,

2573
02:33:10.570 --> 02:33:15.770
When this was now a king, and now is clay?

2574
02:33:17.530 --> 02:33:22.030
Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind

2575
02:33:22.030 --> 02:33:23.970
To do the office for thee of revenge,

2576
02:33:23.970 --> 02:33:27.230
And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,

2577
02:33:27.230 --> 02:33:31.200
As it on earth hath been thy servant still.

2578
02:33:36.900 --> 02:33:40.970
Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,

2579
02:33:40.970 --> 02:33:43.130
Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,

2580
02:33:43.130 --> 02:33:44.830
And instantly return with me again,

2581
02:33:44.830 --> 02:33:46.900
To push destruction and perpetual shame

2582
02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:48.470
Out of the weak door of our fainting land.

2583
02:33:48.470 --> 02:33:51.030
Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;

2584
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:52.700
The Dauphin rages at our very heels.

2585
02:33:52.700 --> 02:33:55.600
It seems you know not, then, so much as we:

2586
02:33:55.600 --> 02:33:58.270
The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,

2587
02:33:58.270 --> 02:33:59.570
Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,

2588
02:33:59.570 --> 02:34:03.500
And brings from him such offers of our peace

2589
02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:05.630
As we with honour and respect may take,

2590
02:34:05.630 --> 02:34:08.630
With purpose presently to leave this war.

2591
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:10.130
He will the rather do it when he sees

2592
02:34:10.130 --> 02:34:11.700
Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.

2593
02:34:11.700 --> 02:34:14.030
Nay, it is in a manner done already;

2594
02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:15.500
For many carriages he hath dispatch'd

2595
02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:17.530
To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel

2596
02:34:17.530 --> 02:34:19.730
To the disposing of the cardinal:

2597
02:34:19.730 --> 02:34:22.400
With whom yourself, myself and other lords,

2598
02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:25.070
If you think meet, this afternoon will post

2599
02:34:25.070 --> 02:34:31.130
To consummate this business happily.

2600
02:34:31.130 --> 02:34:37.130
Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,

2601
02:34:37.130 --> 02:34:38.900
With other princes that may best be spared,

2602
02:34:38.900 --> 02:34:42.170
Shall wait upon your father's funeral.

2603
02:34:42.170 --> 02:34:45.530
At Worcester must his body be interr'd;

2604
02:34:45.530 --> 02:34:47.770
For so he will'd it.

2605
02:34:47.770 --> 02:34:49.730
Thither shall it then:

2606
02:34:49.730 --> 02:34:51.730
And happily may your sweet self put on

2607
02:34:51.730 --> 02:34:55.270
The lineal state and glory of the land!

2608
02:34:55.270 --> 02:34:58.970
To whom with all submission, on my knee

2609
02:34:58.970 --> 02:35:01.230
I do bequeath my faithful services

2610
02:35:01.230 --> 02:35:04.630
And true subjection everlastingly.

2611
02:35:04.630 --> 02:35:06.530
And the like tender of our love we make,

2612
02:35:06.530 --> 02:35:09.930
To rest without a spot for evermore.

2613
02:35:09.930 --> 02:35:12.230
I have a kind soul that would give you thanks

2614
02:35:12.230 --> 02:35:15.000
And knows not how to do it but with tears.

2615
02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:18.300
O, let us pay the time but needful woe,

2616
02:35:18.300 --> 02:35:21.570
Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.

2617
02:35:21.570 --> 02:35:25.230
This England never did, nor never shall,

2618
02:35:25.230 --> 02:35:27.900
Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,

2619
02:35:27.900 --> 02:35:31.100
But when it first did help to wound itself.

2620
02:35:31.100 --> 02:35:33.370
Now these her princes are come home again,

2621
02:35:33.370 --> 02:35:34.970
Come the three corners of the world in arms,

2622
02:35:34.970 --> 02:35:37.930
And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,

2623
02:35:37.930 --> 02:35:42.530
If England to itself do rest but true.

2624
02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:02.370
(♪chanting)

2625
02:38:06.570 --> 02:38:07.570


2626
02:38:08.730 --> 02:38:11.730
