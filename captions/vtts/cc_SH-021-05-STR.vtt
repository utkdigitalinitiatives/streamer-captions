00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.470


2
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:18.470
(chanting) Amen.

3
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.270
Have you perused theletters from the pope,

4
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.030
The emperor and the Earlof Armagnac?

5
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.530
I have, my lord: and theirintent is this:

6
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.970
They humbly sue unto yourexcellence

7
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.300
To have a godly peaceconcluded of

8
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.400
Between the realms ofEngland and of France.

9
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.170
How doth your grace affecttheir motion?

10
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.300
Well, my good lord; and asthe only means

11
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.770
To stop effusion of ourChristian blood

12
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.070
And 'stablish quietness onevery side.

13
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.000
Ay, marry, uncle; for Ialways thought

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.730
It was both impious andunnatural

15
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.470
That such immanity andbloody strife

16
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.200
Should reign amongprofessors of one faith.

17
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.730
Beside, my lord, thesooner to effect

18
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.330
And surer bind this knotof amity,

19
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.600
The Earl of Armagnac, nearknit to Charles,

20
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.530
A man of great authorityin France,

21
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.300
Proffers his only daughterto your grace

22
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.770
In marriage, with a largeand sumptuous dowry.

23
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.530
Marriage, uncle! alas, myyears are young!

24
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.500
And fitter is my study andmy books

25
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.800
Than wanton dalliance witha paramour.

26
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.370
Yet call the ambassador;and, as you please,

27
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.400
So let them have theiranswers every one:

28
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.170
I shall be well contentwith any choice

29
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.400
Tends to God's glory andmy country's weal.

30
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.230
What! is my Lord ofWinchester install'd,

31
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.430
And call'd unto acardinal's degree?

32
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.770
Then I perceive that willbe verified

33
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.470
Henry the Fifth didsometime prophesy,

34
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.500
'If once he come to be acardinal,

35
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.870
He'll make his capco-equal with the crown.'

36
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.870
My lords ambassadors, yourseveral suits

37
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.230
Have been consider'd anddebated on.

38
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.300
Your purpose is both good andreasonable.

39
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.270
And therefore are wecertainly resolved

40
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.100
To draw conditions of afriendly peace;

41
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.030
Which by my Lord ofWinchester we mean

42
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.300
Shall be transportedpresently to France.

43
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.130
And for the proffer of mylord your master,

44
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.500
I have inform'd hishighness so at large

45
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.700
As liking of the lady'svirtuous gifts,

46
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.970
Her beauty and the valueof her dower,

47
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.530
He doth intend she shallbe England's queen.

48
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.870
In argument and proof ofwhich contract,

49
00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.100
Bear her this jewel,pledge of my affection.

50
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.030
And so, my lord protector,see them guarded

51
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.970
And safely brought toDover; where inshipp'd

52
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.270
Commit them to the fortuneof the sea.

53
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.530
Stay, my lord legate: youshall first receive

54
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.330
The sum of money which Ipromised

55
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.370
Should be deliver'd to hisholiness

56
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.330
For clothing me in thesegrave ornaments.

57
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.530
I will attend upon yourlordship's leisure.

58
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.030
Now Winchester will notsubmit, I trow,

59
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.370
Or be inferior to theproudest peer.

60
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.470
Humphrey of Gloucester,thou shalt well perceive

61
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.230
That, neither in birth orfor authority,

62
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.530
The bishop will beoverborne by thee:

63
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.000
I'll either make theestoop and bend thy knee,

64
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.970
Or sack this country witha mutiny.

65
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.070
The regent conquers, andthe Frenchmen fly.

66
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.300
Now help, ye charmingspells and periapts;

67
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.600
And ye choice spirits thatadmonish me

68
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.700
Appear and aid me in thisenterprise.

69
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.030
Now, ye familiar spirits,that are cull'd

70
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.500
Out of the powerfulregions under earth,

71
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.370
Help me this once, thatFrance may get the field.

72
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.170
O, hold me not withsilence over-long!

73
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.570
Where I was wont to feedyou with my blood,

74
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.330
I'll lop a member off andgive it you

75
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.130
In earnest of furtherbenefit,

76
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.730
So you do condescend tohelp me now.

77
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.930
No hope to have redress?My body shall

78
00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.430
Pay recompense, if youwill grant my suit.

79
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.570
Cannot my body norblood-sacrifice

80
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.300
Entreat you to your wontedfurtherance?

81
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.570
Then take my soul, mybody, soul and all,

82
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.800
Before that England givethe French the foil.

83
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.900
See, they forsake me!

84
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.030
My ancient incantationsare too weak,

85
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.500
And hell too strong for meto buckle with:

86
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.770
Now, France, thy glorydroopeth to the dust.

87
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.900
Damsel of France, I thinkI have you fast:

88
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:06.230
A goodly prize, fit forthe devil's grace!

89
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.700
See, how the ugly wenchdoth bend her brows,

90
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.100
As if with Circe she wouldchange my shape!

91
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.570
Changed to a worser shapethou canst not be.

92
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.670
O, Charles the Dauphin isa proper man;

93
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.330
No shape but his canplease your dainty eye.

94
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.030
A plaguing mischief lighton Charles and thee!

95
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.630
And may ye both besuddenly surprised

96
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.000
By bloody hands, insleeping on your beds!

97
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.070
Fell banning hag,enchantress, hold thy tongue!

98
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.830
I prithee, give me leaveto curse awhile.

99
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.370
Curse, miscreant, whenthou comest to the stake.

100
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:55.700
Be what thou wilt, thouart my prisoner.

101
00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.970
O fairest beauty, do notfear nor fly!

102
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.170
For I will touch thee butwith reverent hands;

103
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.970
And lay them gentlyon thy tender side.

104
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.430
I kiss these fingersfor eternal peace,

105
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.670
Who art thou? say, that Imay honour thee.

106
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.070
Margaret my name, anddaughter to a king,

107
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.000
The King of Naples,whosoe'er thou art.

108
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.800
An earl I am, and Suffolkam I call'd.

109
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.500
Be not offended, nature'smiracle,

110
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.370
Thou art allotted to beta'en by me:

111
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.070
So doth the swan her downycygnets save,

112
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.600
Keeping them prisonerunderneath her wings.

113
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.970
But, if this servile usageonce offend.

114
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:57.300
Go, and be free again, asSuffolk's friend.

115
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:08.630
O, stay! I have no powerto let her pass;

116
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.770
My hand would free her,but my heart says no

117
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.370
As plays the sun upon theglassy streams,

118
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.100
Twinkling anothercounterfeited beam,

119
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:24.030
So seems this gorgeousbeauty to mine eyes.

120
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.800
Fain would I woo her, yetI dare not speak:

121
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.300
I'll call for pen and ink,and write my mind.

122
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.130
Fie, de la Pole! disablenot thyself;

123
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.130
Hast not a tongue? is shenot prisoner here?

124
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:45.270
Wilt thou be daunted at awoman's sight?

125
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:49.370
Ay, beauty's princelymajesty is such,

126
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.100
Confounds the tongue andmakes the senses rough.

127
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.970
Say, Earl of Suffolk--ifthy name be so--

128
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.600
What ransom must I paybefore I pass?

129
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.170
For I perceive I am thyprisoner.

130
00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.200
How canst thou tell shewill deny thy suit,

131
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.400
Before thou make a trialof her love?

132
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.630
Why speak'st thou not?what ransom must I pay?

133
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.870
She's beautiful, andtherefore to be woo'd;

134
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.130
She is a woman, thereforeto be won.

135
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.070
Wilt thou accept ofransom? yea, or no.

136
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.070
Fond man, remember thatthou hast a wife;

137
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:25.970
Then how can Margaret bethy paramour?

138
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.770
T'were best to leave him,for he will not hear.

139
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.170
There all is marr'd; therelies a cooling card.

140
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.830
He talks at random; sure,the man is mad.

141
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.900
And yet a dispensation maybe had.

142
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.200
And yet I would that youwould answer me.

143
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.200
I'll win this LadyMargaret. For whom?

144
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.730
Why, for my king: tush,that's a wooden thing!

145
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:53.300
He talks of wood: it issome carpenter.

146
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.900
Yet so my fancy may besatisfied,

147
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.130
And peace establishedbetween these realms

148
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.630
But there remains ascruple in that too;

149
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.670
For though her father bethe King of Naples,

150
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.600
Duke of Anjou and Maine,yet is he poor,

151
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.400
And our nobility willscorn the match.

152
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.100
Hear ye, captain, are younot at leisure?

153
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.600
It shall be so, disdainthey ne'er so much.

154
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.270
Henry is youthful and willquickly yield.

155
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:23.070
Madam, I have a secret toreveal.

156
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.570
What though I be enthrall'd?he seems a knight,

157
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.470
And will not any waydishonour me.

158
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.130
Lady, vouchsafe to listenwhat I say.

159
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.930
Perhaps I shall be rescuedby the French;

160
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.430
And then I need not cravehis courtesy.

161
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.030
Sweet madam, give me ahearing in a cause--

162
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.900
Tush, women have beencaptivate ere now.

163
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.330
Lady, wherefore talk youso?

164
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:49.730
I cry you mercy, 'tis butQuid for Quo.

165
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.370
Say, gentle princess,would you not suppose

166
00:10:53.370 --> 00:11:00.270
Your bondage happy, to bemade a queen?

167
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.470
To be a queen in bondageis more vile

168
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.330
Than is a slave in baseservility;

169
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.070
For princes should befree.

170
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.300
And so shall you,

171
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.170
If happy England's royalking be free.

172
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:20.370
Why, what concerns hisfreedom unto me?

173
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.870
I'll undertake to makethee Henry's queen,

174
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.430
To put a golden sceptre inthy hand

175
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.300
And set a precious crownupon thy head,

176
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:34.970
If thou wilt condescend tobe my--

177
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.430
What?

178
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:42.870
His love.

179
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.530
I am unworthy to beHenry's wife.

180
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.270
No, gentle madam; Iunworthy am

181
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:50.570
To woo so fair a dame tobe his wife,

182
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:55.030
And have no portion in thechoice myself.

183
00:11:55.030 --> 00:12:01.530
How say you, madam, are yeso content?

184
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:09.770
An if my father please, Iam content.

185
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:14.030
Then call our captains andour colours forth.

186
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.130
And, madam, at yourfather's castle walls

187
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.800
We'll crave a parley, toconfer with him.

188
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.730
(A parley sounded)

189
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.470
See, Reignier, see, thydaughter prisoner!

190
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:30.570
To whom?

191
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:31.670
To me.

192
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.870
Suffolk, what remedy?

193
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.370
I am a soldier, and unaptto weep,

194
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.530
Or to exclaim on fortune'sfickleness.

195
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.870
Yes, there is remedyenough, my lord:

196
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:45.730
Consent, and for thyhonour give consent,

197
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.770
Thy daughter shall bewedded to my king;

198
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:55.000
Whom I with pain havewoo'd and won thereto;

199
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.570
And this her easy-heldimprisonment

200
00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:02.300
Hath gained thy daughterprincely liberty.

201
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.800
Speaks Suffolk as hethinks?

202
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.430
Fair Margaret knows

203
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:13.100
That Suffolk doth notflatter, face, or feign.

204
00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.200
What answer makes yourgrace unto my suit?

205
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.900
Since thou dost deign towoo her little worth

206
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.300
To be the princely brideof such a lord;

207
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.230
Upon condition I mayquietly

208
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.930
Enjoy mine own, thecountry Maine and Anjou,

209
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.530
Free from oppression orthe stroke of war,

210
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:35.300
My daughter shall beHenry's, if he please.

211
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.070
That is her ransom; Ideliver her;

212
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.830
And those two counties Iwill undertake

213
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.800
Your grace shall well andquietly enjoy.

214
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.100
And I again, in Henry'sroyal name,

215
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.370
As deputy unto thatgracious king,

216
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:51.800
Give thee her hand, forsign of plighted faith.

217
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.370
Reignier of France, I givethee kingly thanks,

218
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.030
Because this is in trafficof a king.

219
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.170
And yet, methinks, I couldbe well content

220
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.330
To be mine own attorney inthis case.

221
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:07.870
I'll over then to Englandwith this news,

222
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.570
And make this marriage tobe solemnized.

223
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:15.470
So farewell, Reignier: setthis diamond safe

224
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:20.130
In golden palaces, as itbecomes.

225
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:25.870
I do embrace thee, as Iwould embrace

226
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.730
The Christian prince, KingHenry, were he here.

227
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:33.970
Farewell, my lord: goodwishes, praise and prayers

228
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.100
Shall Suffolk ever have ofMargaret.

229
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:44.500
Farewell, sweet maid: buthark you, Margaret;

230
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.330
No princely commendationsto my king?

231
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.430
Such commendations asbecomes a maid,

232
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:55.470
A virgin and his servant,say to him.

233
00:14:55.470 --> 00:15:00.930
Words sweetly placed andmodestly directed.

234
00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:04.730
But madam, I must troubleyou again;

235
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.770
No loving token to hismajesty?

236
00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:14.330
Yes, my good lord, a pureunspotted heart,

237
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:19.870
Never yet taint with love,I send the king.

238
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.130
And this withal.

239
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:36.600
That for thyself: I willnot so presume

240
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:42.430
To send such peevishtokens to a king.

241
00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:57.570
O, wert thou for myself!But, Suffolk, stay;

242
00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:01.070
Thou mayst not wander inthat labyrinth;

243
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:06.300
There Minotaurs and uglytreasons lurk.

244
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.400
Solicit Henry with herwondrous praise:

245
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.830
Bethink thee on hervirtues that surmount,

246
00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.170
And natural graces thatextinguish art;

247
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.470
Repeat their semblanceoften on the seas,

248
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:20.430
That, when thou comest tokneel at Henry's feet,

249
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:25.230
Thou mayst bereave him ofhis wits with wonder.

250
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:36.170
Bring forth that sorceresscondemn'd to burn.

251
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:06.800
Ah, Joan, this kills thyfather's heart outright!

252
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.300
Have I sought everycountry far and near,

253
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.200
And, now it is my chanceto find thee out,

254
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.500
Must I behold thy timelesscruel death?

255
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:20.700
Ah, Joan, sweet daughterJoan, I'll die with thee!

256
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:25.900
Decrepit miser! baseignoble wretch!

257
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.670
I am descended of agentler blood:

258
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:32.830
Thou art no father nor nofriend of mine.

259
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:38.900
Out, out! My lords, anplease you, 'tis not so;

260
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.100
I did beget her, all theparish knows:

261
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.500
Her mother liveth yet, cantestify

262
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.670
She was the first fruit ofmy bachelorship.

263
00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:51.500
Graceless! wilt thou denythy parentage?

264
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.200
This argues what her kindof life hath been,

265
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:58.170
Wicked and vile; and soher death concludes.

266
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:02.070
Fie, Joan, that thou wiltbe so obstacle!

267
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.670
God knows thou art acollop of my flesh;

268
00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.400
And for thy sake have Ished many a tear:

269
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.930
Deny me not, I prithee,gentle Joan.

270
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.830
Peasant, avaunt! You havesuborn'd this man,

271
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.500
Of purpose to obscure mynoble birth.

272
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.430
'Tis true, I gave a nobleto the priest

273
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.600
The morn that I was weddedto her mother.

274
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:33.000
Kneel down and take myblessing, good my girl.

275
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.800
Wilt thou not stoop? Nowcursed be the time

276
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.430
Of thy nativity! I wouldthe milk

277
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.500
Thy mother gave thee whenthou suck'dst her breast,

278
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.270
Had been a little ratsbanefor thy sake!

279
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.000
Or else, when thou didstkeep my lambs a-field,

280
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.170
I wish some ravenous wolfhad eaten thee!

281
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.830
Dost thou deny thy father,cursed drab?

282
00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:02.170
O, burn her, burn her!hanging is too good.

283
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.670
Take her away; for shehath lived too long,

284
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.670
To fill the world withvicious qualities.

285
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:17.130
First, let me tell youwhom you have condemn'd:

286
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.530
Not me begotten of ashepherd swain,

287
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.470
But issued from theprogeny of kings;

288
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:27.030
Virtuous and holy; chosenfrom above,

289
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.770
By inspiration ofcelestial grace,

290
00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:33.700
To work exceeding miracleson earth.

291
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.970
I never had to do withwicked spirits:

292
00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.800
But you, that are pollutedwith your lusts,

293
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.370
Stain'd with the guiltlessblood of innocents,

294
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.170
Corrupt and tainted with athousand vices,

295
00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.830
Because you want the gracethat others have,

296
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.200
You judge it straight athing impossible

297
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.370
To compass wonders but byhelp of devils.

298
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:59.000
No, misconceived! Joan ofArc hath been

299
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.200
A virgin from her tenderinfancy,

300
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.000
Chaste and immaculate invery thought;

301
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.330
Whose maiden blood, thusrigorously effused,

302
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.070
Will cry for vengeance atthe gates of heaven.

303
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.130
Ay, ay: away with her toexecution!

304
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.970
And hark ye, sirs; becauseshe is a maid,

305
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.930
Spare for no faggots, letthere be enow:

306
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:27.000
Place barrels of pitchupon the fatal stake,

307
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.830
That so her torture may beshortened.

308
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.600
Will nothing turn yourunrelenting hearts?

309
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.070
Then, Joan, discover thineinfirmity,

310
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.570
That warranteth by law tobe thy privilege.

311
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.730
I am with child, ye bloodyhomicides:

312
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.600
Murder not then the fruitwithin my womb,

313
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.230
Although ye hale me to aviolent death.

314
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:57.730
Now heaven forfend! theholy maid with child!

315
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.770
The greatest miracle thate'er ye wrought:

316
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:05.170
Is all your strictpreciseness come to this?

317
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:09.770
She and the Dauphin havebeen juggling:

318
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.770
I did imagine what wouldbe her refuge.

319
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.330
Well, go to; we'll have nobastards live;

320
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.200
Especially since Charlesmust father it.

321
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.930
You are deceived; my childis none of his:

322
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.700
It was Alencon thatenjoy'd my love.

323
00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:27.430
Alencon! that notoriousMachiavel!

324
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.430
It dies, an if it had athousand lives.

325
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:30.970
O, give me leave, I havedeluded you:

326
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.870
'Twas neither Charles noryet the duke I named,

327
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.770
But Reignier, king ofNaples, that prevail'd.

328
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:41.130
A married man! that's mostintolerable.

329
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:46.370
Why, here's a girl! Ithink she knows not well,

330
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:50.700
There were so many, whomshe may accuse.

331
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.830
It's sign she hath beenliberal and free.

332
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:58.000
And yet, forsooth, she isa virgin pure.

333
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.330
Strumpet, thy wordscondemn thy brat and thee:

334
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:13.170
Use no entreaty, for it isin vain.

335
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:21.470
Then lead me hence; withwhom I leave my curse:

336
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:25.270
May never glorious sunreflex his beams

337
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.700
Upon the country where youmake abode;

338
00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.430
But darkness and thegloomy shade of death

339
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:36.400
Environ you, till mischiefand despair

340
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:42.530
Drive you to break yournecks or hang yourselves!

341
00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:46.800
Break thou in pieces andconsume to ashes,

342
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.900
Thou foul accursedminister of hell!

343
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.670
Lord regent, I do greetyour excellence

344
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:58.270
With letters of commissionfrom the king.

345
00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.670
For know, my lords, thestates of Christendom,

346
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:04.730
Moved with remorse ofthese outrageous broils,

347
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.870
Have earnestly implored ageneral peace

348
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:11.370
Betwixt our nation and theaspiring French;

349
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.130
And here at hand theDauphin and his train

350
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.970
Approacheth, to conferabout some matter.

351
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:30.970
Is all our travail turn'dto this effect?

352
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:35.230
After the slaughter of somany peers,

353
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:39.370
So many captains,gentlemen and soldiers,

354
00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.170
That in this quarrel havebeen overthrown

355
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:46.500
And sold their bodies fortheir country's benefit,

356
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:51.030
Shall we at last concludeeffeminate peace?

357
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.730
Have we not lost most partof all the towns,

358
00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:00.070
By treason, falsehood andby treachery,

359
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:04.930
Our great progenitors hadconquered?

360
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:08.800
O Warwick, Warwick! Iforesee with grief

361
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.970
The utter loss of all therealm of France.

362
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:15.400
Be patient, York: if weconclude a peace,

363
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.870
It shall be with suchstrict and severe covenants

364
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:21.800
As little shall theFrenchmen gain thereby.

365
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.230
Since, lords of England,it is thus agreed

366
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.900
That peaceful truce shallbe proclaim'd in France,

367
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.900
We come to be informed byyourselves

368
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:51.230
What the conditions ofthat league must be.

369
00:24:55.330 --> 00:25:00.830
Speak, Winchester; forboiling choler chokes

370
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.270
The hollow passage of mypoison'd voice,

371
00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:10.100
By sight of these ourbaleful enemies.

372
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.170
Charles, and the rest, itis enacted thus:

373
00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:15.870
That, in regard King Henrygives consent,

374
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.970
Of mere compassion and oflenity,

375
00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.630
To ease your country ofdistressful war,

376
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:24.670
And suffer you to breathein fruitful peace,

377
00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:29.500
You shall become trueliegemen to his crown:

378
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.270
And Charles, uponcondition thou wilt swear

379
00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.870
To pay him tribute, submitthyself,

380
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:37.530
Thou shalt be placed asviceroy under him,

381
00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:40.300
And still enjoy thy regaldignity.

382
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:47.300
Must he be then as shadowof himself?

383
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.330
Adorn his temples with acoronet,

384
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:54.230
And yet, in substance andauthority,

385
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.830
Retain but privilege of aprivate man?

386
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:06.630
This proffer is absurd andreasonless.

387
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.630
'Tis known already that Iam possess'd

388
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.600
With more than half theGallian territories,

389
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.730
And therein reverenced fortheir lawful king:

390
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.700
Shall I, for lucre of therest unvanquish'd,

391
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.170
Detract so much from thatprerogative,

392
00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:22.500
As to be call'd butviceroy of the whole?

393
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.270
No, lord ambassador, I'llrather keep

394
00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.330
That which I have than,coveting for more,

395
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:29.600
Be cast from possibilityof all.

396
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:40.530
Insulting Charles! hastthou by secret means

397
00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:44.600
Used intercession toobtain a league,

398
00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.600
And, now the matter growsto compromise,

399
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.170
Stand'st thou aloof uponcomparison?

400
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.830
Either accept the titlethou usurp'st,

401
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:57.970
Of benefit proceeding fromour king

402
00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:03.030
And not of any challengeof desert,

403
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:11.630
Or we will plague theewith incessant wars.

404
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.830
My lord, you do not wellin obstinacy

405
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.330
To cavil in the course ofthis contract:

406
00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:20.800
If once it be neglected,ten to one

407
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.900
We shall not find likeopportunity.

408
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.870
To say the truth, it isyour policy

409
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.730
To save your subjects fromsuch massacre

410
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.300
And ruthless slaughters asare daily seen

411
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.770
By our proceeding inhostility;

412
00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:35.030
And therefore take thiscompact of a truce,

413
00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:40.500
Although you break it whenyour pleasure serves.

414
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.430
How say'st thou, Charles?shall our condition stand?

415
00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.300
It shall;

416
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.700
Only reserved, you claimno interest

417
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.230
In any of our towns ofgarrison.

418
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:08.200
Then swear allegiance tohis majesty,

419
00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:27.000
As thou art knight, neverto disobey

420
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.670
Nor be rebellious to thecrown of England,

421
00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:45.130
Thou, nor thy nobles, tothe crown of England.

422
00:28:53.130 --> 00:29:01.230
So, now dismiss your armywhen ye please:

423
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:05.800
Hang up your ensign, letyour drums be still,

424
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:11.370
For here we entertain asolemn peace.

425
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.630
Your wondrous raredescription, noble earl,

426
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.300
Of beauteous Margaret hathastonish'd me:

427
00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.300
Her virtues graced withexternal gifts

428
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.070
Do breed love's settledpassions in my heart:

429
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.930
And like as rigor oftempestuous gusts

430
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.870
Provokes the mightiesthulk against the tide,

431
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:30.200
So am I driven by breathof her renown

432
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.270
Either to suffer shipwreckor arrive

433
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.600
Where I may have fruitionof her love.

434
00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.300
Tush, my good lord, thissuperficial tale

435
00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.130
Is but a preface of herworthy praise;

436
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:42.830
And, which is more, she isnot so divine,

437
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.830
So full-replete withchoice of all delights,

438
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:48.170
But with as humblelowliness of mind

439
00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:52.200
She is content to be atyour command;

440
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.770
Command, I mean, ofvirtuous chaste intents,

441
00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:59.170
To love and honour Henryas her lord.

442
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:02.070
And otherwise will Henryne'er presume.

443
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:05.100
Therefore, my lordprotector, give consent

444
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:10.200
That Margaret may beEngland's royal queen.

445
00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.170
So should I give consentto flatter sin.

446
00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:15.970
You know, yourhighness is betroth'd

447
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.400
Unto another lady ofesteem:

448
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.900
How shall we then dispensewith that contract,

449
00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.670
And not deface your honourwith reproach?

450
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:27.830
As doth a ruler withunlawful oaths;

451
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:30.870
Or one that, at a triumphhaving vow'd

452
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.270
To try his strength,forsaketh yet the lists

453
00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:35.030
By reason of hisadversary's odds:

454
00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:38.170
A poor earl's daughter isunequal odds,

455
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.200
And therefore may be brokewithout offence.

456
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.430
Why, what, I pray, isMargaret more than that?

457
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:46.630
Her father is no betterthan an earl,

458
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:49.000
Although in glorioustitles he excel.

459
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.700
Yes, lord, her father is aking,

460
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.230
The King of Naples andJerusalem;

461
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:54.630
(laughing)

462
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:56.770
And of such greatauthority in France

463
00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.200
As his alliance willconfirm our peace

464
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.670
And keep the Frenchmen inallegiance.

465
00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:03.730
And so the Earl ofArmagnac may do,

466
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.300
Because he is near kinsmanunto Charles.

467
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.970
Beside, his wealth dothwarrant a liberal dower,

468
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:11.330
Where Reignier sooner willreceive than give.

469
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:15.570
A dower, my lords!disgrace not so your king,

470
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:18.100
That he should be soabject, base and poor,

471
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.870
To choose for wealth andnot for perfect love.

472
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.800
Henry is able to enrichhis queen

473
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.470
And not seek a queen tomake him rich:

474
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.230
So worthless peasantsbargain for their wives,

475
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.600
As market-men for oxen,sheep, or horse.

476
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.400
Marriage is a matter ofmore worth

477
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.570
Than to be dealt in byattorneyship;

478
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.530
Not whom we will, but whomhis grace affects,

479
00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:44.870
Must be companion of hisnuptial bed:

480
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:47.870
For what is wedlock forcedbut a hell,

481
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:50.900
An age of discord andcontinual strife?

482
00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.030
Whereas the contrarybringeth bliss,

483
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:55.930
And is a pattern ofcelestial peace.

484
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.500
Whom should we match withHenry, being a king,

485
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.800
But Margaret, that isdaughter to a king?

486
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.300
Her peerless feature,joined with her birth,

487
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.800
Approves her fit for nonebut for a king:

488
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.070
Her valiant courage andundaunted spirit,

489
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.600
More than in womencommonly is seen,

490
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.930
Will answer our hope inissue of a king;

491
00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.730
For Henry, son unto aconqueror,

492
00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.270
Is likely to beget moreconquerors,

493
00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:23.270
If with a lady of so highresolve

494
00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:26.070
As is fair Margaret he belink'd in love.

495
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:29.270
Then yield, my lords; andhere conclude with me

496
00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:33.730
That Margaret shall bequeen, and none but she.

497
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:34.930
Whether it be throughforce of your report,

498
00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:36.670
My noble Lord of Suffolk,or for that

499
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:37.900
My tender youth was neveryet attaint

500
00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.930
With any passion ofinflaming love,

501
00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.830
I cannot tell; but this Iam assured,

502
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:44.770
I feel such sharpdissension in my breast,

503
00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:48.200
Such fierce alarums bothof hope and fear,

504
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.170
As I am sick with workingof my thoughts.

505
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.800
Take, therefore, shipping;post, my lord, to France;

506
00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.470
Agree to any covenants,and procure

507
00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:57.100
That Lady Margaret dovouchsafe to come

508
00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.700
To cross the seas toEngland and be crown'd

509
00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.770
King Henry's faithful andanointed queen:

510
00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:03.900
For your expenses andsufficient charge,

511
00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.200
Among the people gather upa tenth.

512
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.470
Be gone, I say; for, tillyou do return,

513
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:14.070
I rest perplexed with athousand cares.

514
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:28.100
And you, good uncle,banish all offence:

515
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.170
If you do censure me bywhat you were,

516
00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:34.330
Not what you are, I knowit will excuse

517
00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:40.530
This sudden execution ofmy will.

518
00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:45.700
And so, conduct me where,from company,

519
00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:50.600
I may revolve and ruminatemy grief.

520
00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:07.170
Ay, grief, I fear me, bothat first and last.

521
00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:19.570
Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd;and thus he goes,

522
00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:22.070
As did the youthful Parisonce to Greece,

523
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:25.870
With hope to find the likeevent in love,

524
00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:30.100
But prosper better thanthe Trojan did.

525
00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:35.730
Margaret shall now bequeen, and rule the king;

526
00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:44.370
