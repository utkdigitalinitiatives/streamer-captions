00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.470


2
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:18.470
(chanting) Amen.

3
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.270
Have you perused the letters from the pope,

4
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.030
The emperor and the Earl of Armagnac?

5
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.530
I have, my lord: and their intent is this:

6
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.970
They humbly sue unto your excellence

7
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.300
To have a godly peace concluded of

8
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.400
Between the realms of England and of France.

9
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.170
How doth your grace affect their motion?

10
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.300
Well, my good lord; and as the only means

11
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.770
To stop effusion of our Christian blood

12
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.070
And 'stablish quietness on every side.

13
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.000
Ay, marry, uncle; for I always thought

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.730
It was both impious and unnatural

15
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.470
That such immanity and bloody strife

16
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.200
Should reign among professors of one faith.

17
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.730
Beside, my lord, the sooner to effect

18
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.330
And surer bind this knot of amity,

19
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.600
The Earl of Armagnac, near knit to Charles,

20
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.530
A man of great authority in France,

21
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.300
Proffers his only daughter to your grace

22
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.770
In marriage, with a large and sumptuous dowry.

23
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.530
Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!

24
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.500
And fitter is my study and my books

25
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.800
Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.

26
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.370
Yet call the ambassador; and, as you please,

27
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.400
So let them have their answers every one:

28
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.170
I shall be well content with any choice

29
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.400
Tends to God's glory and my country's weal.

30
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.230
What! is my Lord of Winchester install'd,

31
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.430
And call'd unto a cardinal's degree?

32
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.770
Then I perceive that will be verified

33
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.470
Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy,

34
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.500
'If once he come to be a cardinal,

35
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.870
He'll make his cap co-equal with the crown.'

36
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.870
My lords ambassadors, your several suits

37
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.230
Have been consider'd and debated on.

38
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.300
Your purpose is both good and reasonable.

39
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.270
And therefore are we certainly resolved

40
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.100
To draw conditions of a friendly peace;

41
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.030
Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean

42
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.300
Shall be transported presently to France.

43
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.130
And for the proffer of my lord your master,

44
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.500
I have inform'd his highness so at large

45
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.700
As liking of the lady's virtuous gifts,

46
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.970
Her beauty and the value of her dower,

47
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.530
He doth intend she shall be England's queen.

48
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.870
In argument and proof of which contract,

49
00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.100
Bear her this jewel, pledge of my affection.

50
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.030
And so, my lord protector, see them guarded

51
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.970
And safely brought to Dover; where inshipp'd

52
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.270
Commit them to the fortune of the sea.

53
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.530
Stay, my lord legate: you shall first receive

54
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.330
The sum of money which I promised

55
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.370
Should be deliver'd to his holiness

56
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.330
For clothing me in these grave ornaments.

57
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.530
I will attend upon your lordship's leisure.

58
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.030
Now Winchester will not submit, I trow,

59
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.370
Or be inferior to the proudest peer.

60
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.470
Humphrey of Gloucester, thou shalt well perceive

61
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.230
That, neither in birth or for authority,

62
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.530
The bishop will be overborne by thee:

63
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.000
I'll either make thee stoop and bend thy knee,

64
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.970
Or sack this country with a mutiny.

65
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.070
The regent conquers, and the Frenchmen fly.

66
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.300
Now help, ye charming spells and periapts;

67
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.600
And ye choice spirits that admonish me

68
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.700
Appear and aid me in this enterprise.

69
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.030
Now, ye familiar spirits, that are cull'd

70
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.500
Out of the powerful regions under earth,

71
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.370
Help me this once, that France may get the field.

72
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.170
O, hold me not with silence over-long!

73
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.570
Where I was wont to feed you with my blood,

74
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.330
I'll lop a member off and give it you

75
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.130
In earnest of further benefit,

76
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.730
So you do condescend to help me now.

77
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.930
No hope to have redress? My body shall

78
00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.430
Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit.

79
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.570
Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice

80
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.300
Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?

81
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.570
Then take my soul, my body, soul and all,

82
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.800
Before that England give the French the foil.

83
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.900
See, they forsake me!

84
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.030
My ancient incantations are too weak,

85
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.500
And hell too strong for me to buckle with:

86
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.770
Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.

87
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.900
Damsel of France, I think I have you fast:

88
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:06.230
A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!

89
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.700
See, how the ugly wench doth bend her brows,

90
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.100
As if with Circe she would change my shape!

91
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.570
Changed to a worser shape thou canst not be.

92
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.670
O, Charles the Dauphin is a proper man;

93
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.330
No shape but his can please your dainty eye.

94
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.030
A plaguing mischief light on Charles and thee!

95
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.630
And may ye both be suddenly surprised

96
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.000
By bloody hands, in sleeping on your beds!

97
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.070
Fell banning hag, enchantress, hold thy tongue!

98
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.830
I prithee, give me leave to curse awhile.

99
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.370
Curse, miscreant, when thou comest to the stake.

100
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:55.700
Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.

101
00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.970
O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly!

102
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.170
For I will touch thee but with reverent hands;

103
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.970
And lay them gently on thy tender side.

104
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.430
I kiss these fingers for eternal peace,

105
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.670
Who art thou? say, that I may honour thee.

106
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.070
Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,

107
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.000
The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art.

108
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.800
An earl I am, and Suffolk am I call'd.

109
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.500
Be not offended, nature's miracle,

110
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.370
Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me:

111
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.070
So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,

112
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.600
Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings.

113
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.970
But, if this servile usage once offend.

114
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:57.300
Go, and be free again, as Suffolk's friend.

115
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:08.630
O, stay! I have no power to let her pass;

116
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.770
My hand would free her, but my heart says no

117
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.370
As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,

118
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.100
Twinkling another counterfeited beam,

119
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:24.030
So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.

120
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.800
Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak:

121
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.300
I'll call for pen and ink, and write my mind.

122
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.130
Fie, de la Pole! disable not thyself;

123
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.130
Hast not a tongue? is she not prisoner here?

124
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:45.270
Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?

125
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:49.370
Ay, beauty's princely majesty is such,

126
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.100
Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.

127
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.970
Say, Earl of Suffolk--if thy name be so--

128
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.600
What ransom must I pay before I pass?

129
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.170
For I perceive I am thy prisoner.

130
00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.200
How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit,

131
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.400
Before thou make a trial of her love?

132
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.630
Why speak'st thou not? what ransom must I pay?

133
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.870
She's beautiful, and therefore to be woo'd;

134
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.130
She is a woman, therefore to be won.

135
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.070
Wilt thou accept of ransom? yea, or no.

136
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.070
Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife;

137
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:25.970
Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?

138
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.770
T'were best to leave him, for he will not hear.

139
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.170
There all is marr'd; there lies a cooling card.

140
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.830
He talks at random; sure, the man is mad.

141
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.900
And yet a dispensation may be had.

142
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.200
And yet I would that you would answer me.

143
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.200
I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?

144
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.730
Why, for my king: tush, that's a wooden thing!

145
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:53.300
He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.

146
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.900
Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,

147
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.130
And peace established between these realms

148
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.630
But there remains a scruple in that too;

149
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.670
For though her father be the King of Naples,

150
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.600
Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,

151
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.400
And our nobility will scorn the match.

152
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.100
Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?

153
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.600
It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much.

154
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.270
Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.

155
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:23.070
Madam, I have a secret to reveal.

156
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.570
What though I be enthrall'd? he seems a knight,

157
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.470
And will not any way dishonour me.

158
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.130
Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.

159
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.930
Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French;

160
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.430
And then I need not crave his courtesy.

161
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.030
Sweet madam, give me a hearing in a cause--

162
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.900
Tush, women have been captivate ere now.

163
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.330
Lady, wherefore talk you so?

164
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:49.730
I cry you mercy, 'tis but Quid for Quo.

165
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.370
Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose

166
00:10:53.370 --> 00:11:00.270
Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?

167
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.470
To be a queen in bondage is more vile

168
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.330
Than is a slave in base servility;

169
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.070
For princes should be free.

170
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.300
And so shall you,

171
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.170
If happy England's royal king be free.

172
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:20.370
Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?

173
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.870
I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,

174
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.430
To put a golden sceptre in thy hand

175
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.300
And set a precious crown upon thy head,

176
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:34.970
If thou wilt condescend to be my--

177
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.430
What?

178
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:42.870
His love.

179
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.530
I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.

180
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.270
No, gentle madam; I unworthy am

181
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:50.570
To woo so fair a dame to be his wife,

182
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:55.030
And have no portion in the choice myself.

183
00:11:55.030 --> 00:12:01.530
How say you, madam, are ye so content?

184
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:09.770
An if my father please, I am content.

185
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:14.030
Then call our captains and our colours forth.

186
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.130
And, madam, at your father's castle walls

187
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.800
We'll crave a parley, to confer with him.

188
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.730
(A parley sounded)

189
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.470
See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner!

190
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:30.570
To whom?

191
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:31.670
To me.

192
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.870
Suffolk, what remedy?

193
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.370
I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,

194
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.530
Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness.

195
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.870
Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord:

196
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:45.730
Consent, and for thy honour give consent,

197
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.770
Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king;

198
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:55.000
Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto;

199
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.570
And this her easy-held imprisonment

200
00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:02.300
Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.

201
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.800
Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?

202
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.430
Fair Margaret knows

203
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:13.100
That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign.

204
00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.200
What answer makes your grace unto my suit?

205
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.900
Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth

206
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.300
To be the princely bride of such a lord;

207
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.230
Upon condition I may quietly

208
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.930
Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,

209
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.530
Free from oppression or the stroke of war,

210
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:35.300
My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.

211
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.070
That is her ransom; I deliver her;

212
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.830
And those two counties I will undertake

213
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.800
Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.

214
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.100
And I again, in Henry's royal name,

215
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.370
As deputy unto that gracious king,

216
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:51.800
Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith.

217
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.370
Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,

218
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.030
Because this is in traffic of a king.

219
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.170
And yet, methinks, I could be well content

220
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.330
To be mine own attorney in this case.

221
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:07.870
I'll over then to England with this news,

222
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.570
And make this marriage to be solemnized.

223
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:15.470
So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe

224
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:20.130
In golden palaces, as it becomes.

225
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:25.870
I do embrace thee, as I would embrace

226
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.730
The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here.

227
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:33.970
Farewell, my lord: good wishes, praise and prayers

228
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.100
Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.

229
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:44.500
Farewell, sweet maid: but hark you, Margaret;

230
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.330
No princely commendations to my king?

231
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.430
Such commendations as becomes a maid,

232
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:55.470
A virgin and his servant, say to him.

233
00:14:55.470 --> 00:15:00.930
Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.

234
00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:04.730
But madam, I must trouble you again;

235
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.770
No loving token to his majesty?

236
00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:14.330
Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart,

237
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:19.870
Never yet taint with love, I send the king.

238
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.130
And this withal.

239
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:36.600
That for thyself: I will not so presume

240
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:42.430
To send such peevish tokens to a king.

241
00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:57.570
O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay;

242
00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:01.070
Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth;

243
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:06.300
There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.

244
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.400
Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:

245
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.830
Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,

246
00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.170
And natural graces that extinguish art;

247
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.470
Repeat their semblance often on the seas,

248
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:20.430
That, when thou comest to kneel at Henry's feet,

249
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:25.230
Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.

250
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:36.170
Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn.

251
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:06.800
Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!

252
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.300
Have I sought every country far and near,

253
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.200
And, now it is my chance to find thee out,

254
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.500
Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?

255
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:20.700
Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee!

256
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:25.900
Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!

257
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.670
I am descended of a gentler blood:

258
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:32.830
Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.

259
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:38.900
Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so;

260
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.100
I did beget her, all the parish knows:

261
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.500
Her mother liveth yet, can testify

262
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.670
She was the first fruit of my bachelorship.

263
00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:51.500
Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?

264
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.200
This argues what her kind of life hath been,

265
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:58.170
Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes.

266
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:02.070
Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!

267
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.670
God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;

268
00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.400
And for thy sake have I shed many a tear:

269
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.930
Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.

270
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.830
Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man,

271
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.500
Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.

272
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.430
'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest

273
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.600
The morn that I was wedded to her mother.

274
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:33.000
Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.

275
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.800
Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time

276
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.430
Of thy nativity! I would the milk

277
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.500
Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast,

278
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.270
Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!

279
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.000
Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,

280
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.170
I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!

281
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.830
Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?

282
00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:02.170
O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good.

283
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.670
Take her away; for she hath lived too long,

284
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.670
To fill the world with vicious qualities.

285
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:17.130
First, let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:

286
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.530
Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,

287
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.470
But issued from the progeny of kings;

288
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:27.030
Virtuous and holy; chosen from above,

289
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.770
By inspiration of celestial grace,

290
00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:33.700
To work exceeding miracles on earth.

291
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.970
I never had to do with wicked spirits:

292
00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.800
But you, that are polluted with your lusts,

293
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.370
Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,

294
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.170
Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,

295
00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.830
Because you want the grace that others have,

296
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.200
You judge it straight a thing impossible

297
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.370
To compass wonders but by help of devils.

298
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:59.000
No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been

299
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.200
A virgin from her tender infancy,

300
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.000
Chaste and immaculate in very thought;

301
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.330
Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,

302
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.070
Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.

303
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.130
Ay, ay: away with her to execution!

304
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.970
And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid,

305
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.930
Spare for no faggots, let there be enow:

306
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:27.000
Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,

307
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.830
That so her torture may be shortened.

308
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.600
Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?

309
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.070
Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity,

310
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.570
That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.

311
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.730
I am with child, ye bloody homicides:

312
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.600
Murder not then the fruit within my womb,

313
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.230
Although ye hale me to a violent death.

314
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:57.730
Now heaven forfend! the holy maid with child!

315
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.770
The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:

316
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:05.170
Is all your strict preciseness come to this?

317
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:09.770
She and the Dauphin have been juggling:

318
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.770
I did imagine what would be her refuge.

319
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.330
Well, go to; we'll have no bastards live;

320
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.200
Especially since Charles must father it.

321
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.930
You are deceived; my child is none of his:

322
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.700
It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.

323
00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:27.430
Alencon! that notorious Machiavel!

324
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.430
It dies, an if it had a thousand lives.

325
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:30.970
O, give me leave, I have deluded you:

326
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.870
'Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named,

327
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.770
But Reignier, king of Naples, that prevail'd.

328
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:41.130
A married man! that's most intolerable.

329
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:46.370
Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well,

330
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:50.700
There were so many, whom she may accuse.

331
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.830
It's sign she hath been liberal and free.

332
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:58.000
And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure.

333
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.330
Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee:

334
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:13.170
Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.

335
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:21.470
Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:

336
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:25.270
May never glorious sun reflex his beams

337
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.700
Upon the country where you make abode;

338
00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.430
But darkness and the gloomy shade of death

339
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:36.400
Environ you, till mischief and despair

340
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:42.530
Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!

341
00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:46.800
Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes,

342
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.900
Thou foul accursed minister of hell!

343
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.670
Lord regent, I do greet your excellence

344
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:58.270
With letters of commission from the king.

345
00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.670
For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,

346
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:04.730
Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,

347
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.870
Have earnestly implored a general peace

348
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:11.370
Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;

349
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.130
And here at hand the Dauphin and his train

350
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.970
Approacheth, to confer about some matter.

351
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:30.970
Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?

352
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:35.230
After the slaughter of so many peers,

353
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:39.370
So many captains, gentlemen and soldiers,

354
00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.170
That in this quarrel have been overthrown

355
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:46.500
And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,

356
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:51.030
Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?

357
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.730
Have we not lost most part of all the towns,

358
00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:00.070
By treason, falsehood and by treachery,

359
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:04.930
Our great progenitors had conquered?

360
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:08.800
O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief

361
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.970
The utter loss of all the realm of France.

362
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:15.400
Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,

363
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.870
It shall be with such strict and severe covenants

364
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:21.800
As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.

365
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.230
Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed

366
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.900
That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France,

367
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.900
We come to be informed by yourselves

368
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:51.230
What the conditions of that league must be.

369
00:24:55.330 --> 00:25:00.830
Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes

370
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.270
The hollow passage of my poison'd voice,

371
00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:10.100
By sight of these our baleful enemies.

372
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.170
Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:

373
00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:15.870
That, in regard King Henry gives consent,

374
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.970
Of mere compassion and of lenity,

375
00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.630
To ease your country of distressful war,

376
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:24.670
And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,

377
00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:29.500
You shall become true liegemen to his crown:

378
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.270
And Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear

379
00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.870
To pay him tribute, submit thyself,

380
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:37.530
Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,

381
00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:40.300
And still enjoy thy regal dignity.

382
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:47.300
Must he be then as shadow of himself?

383
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.330
Adorn his temples with a coronet,

384
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:54.230
And yet, in substance and authority,

385
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.830
Retain but privilege of a private man?

386
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:06.630
This proffer is absurd and reasonless.

387
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.630
'Tis known already that I am possess'd

388
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.600
With more than half the Gallian territories,

389
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.730
And therein reverenced for their lawful king:

390
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.700
Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,

391
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.170
Detract so much from that prerogative,

392
00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:22.500
As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?

393
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.270
No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep

394
00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.330
That which I have than, coveting for more,

395
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:29.600
Be cast from possibility of all.

396
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:40.530
Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means

397
00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:44.600
Used intercession to obtain a league,

398
00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.600
And, now the matter grows to compromise,

399
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.170
Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison?

400
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.830
Either accept the title thou usurp'st,

401
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:57.970
Of benefit proceeding from our king

402
00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:03.030
And not of any challenge of desert,

403
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:11.630
Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.

404
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.830
My lord, you do not well in obstinacy

405
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.330
To cavil in the course of this contract:

406
00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:20.800
If once it be neglected, ten to one

407
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.900
We shall not find like opportunity.

408
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.870
To say the truth, it is your policy

409
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.730
To save your subjects from such massacre

410
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.300
And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen

411
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.770
By our proceeding in hostility;

412
00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:35.030
And therefore take this compact of a truce,

413
00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:40.500
Although you break it when your pleasure serves.

414
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.430
How say'st thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?

415
00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.300
It shall;

416
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.700
Only reserved, you claim no interest

417
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.230
In any of our towns of garrison.

418
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:08.200
Then swear allegiance to his majesty,

419
00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:27.000
As thou art knight, never to disobey

420
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.670
Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,

421
00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:45.130
Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.

422
00:28:53.130 --> 00:29:01.230
So, now dismiss your army when ye please:

423
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:05.800
Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,

424
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:11.370
For here we entertain a solemn peace.

425
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.630
Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,

426
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.300
Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:

427
00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.300
Her virtues graced with external gifts

428
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.070
Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:

429
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.930
And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts

430
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.870
Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,

431
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:30.200
So am I driven by breath of her renown

432
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.270
Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive

433
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.600
Where I may have fruition of her love.

434
00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.300
Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale

435
00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.130
Is but a preface of her worthy praise;

436
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:42.830
And, which is more, she is not so divine,

437
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.830
So full-replete with choice of all delights,

438
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:48.170
But with as humble lowliness of mind

439
00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:52.200
She is content to be at your command;

440
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.770
Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,

441
00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:59.170
To love and honour Henry as her lord.

442
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:02.070
And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.

443
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:05.100
Therefore, my lord protector, give consent

444
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:10.200
That Margaret may be England's royal queen.

445
00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.170
So should I give consent to flatter sin.

446
00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:15.970
You know, your highness is betroth'd

447
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.400
Unto another lady of esteem:

448
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.900
How shall we then dispense with that contract,

449
00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.670
And not deface your honour with reproach?

450
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:27.830
As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;

451
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:30.870
Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd

452
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.270
To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists

453
00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:35.030
By reason of his adversary's odds:

454
00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:38.170
A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,

455
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.200
And therefore may be broke without offence.

456
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.430
Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?

457
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:46.630
Her father is no better than an earl,

458
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:49.000
Although in glorious titles he excel.

459
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.700
Yes, lord, her father is a king,

460
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.230
The King of Naples and Jerusalem;

461
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:54.630
(laughing)

462
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:56.770
And of such great authority in France

463
00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.200
As his alliance will confirm our peace

464
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.670
And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.

465
00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:03.730
And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,

466
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.300
Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.

467
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.970
Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,

468
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:11.330
Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.

469
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:15.570
A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,

470
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:18.100
That he should be so abject, base and poor,

471
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.870
To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.

472
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.800
Henry is able to enrich his queen

473
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.470
And not seek a queen to make him rich:

474
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.230
So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,

475
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.600
As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.

476
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.400
Marriage is a matter of more worth

477
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.570
Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;

478
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.530
Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,

479
00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:44.870
Must be companion of his nuptial bed:

480
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:47.870
For what is wedlock forced but a hell,

481
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:50.900
An age of discord and continual strife?

482
00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.030
Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,

483
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:55.930
And is a pattern of celestial peace.

484
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.500
Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,

485
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.800
But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?

486
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.300
Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,

487
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.800
Approves her fit for none but for a king:

488
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.070
Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,

489
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.600
More than in women commonly is seen,

490
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.930
Will answer our hope in issue of a king;

491
00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.730
For Henry, son unto a conqueror,

492
00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.270
Is likely to beget more conquerors,

493
00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:23.270
If with a lady of so high resolve

494
00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:26.070
As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.

495
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:29.270
Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me

496
00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:33.730
That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.

497
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:34.930
Whether it be through force of your report,

498
00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:36.670
My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that

499
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:37.900
My tender youth was never yet attaint

500
00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.930
With any passion of inflaming love,

501
00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.830
I cannot tell; but this I am assured,

502
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:44.770
I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,

503
00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:48.200
Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,

504
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.170
As I am sick with working of my thoughts.

505
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.800
Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;

506
00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.470
Agree to any covenants, and procure

507
00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:57.100
That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come

508
00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.700
To cross the seas to England and be crown'd

509
00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.770
King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:

510
00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:03.900
For your expenses and sufficient charge,

511
00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.200
Among the people gather up a tenth.

512
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.470
Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,

513
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:14.070
I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.

514
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:28.100
And you, good uncle, banish all offence:

515
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.170
If you do censure me by what you were,

516
00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:34.330
Not what you are, I know it will excuse

517
00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:40.530
This sudden execution of my will.

518
00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:45.700
And so, conduct me where, from company,

519
00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:50.600
I may revolve and ruminate my grief.

520
00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:07.170
Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.

521
00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:19.570
Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,

522
00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:22.070
As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,

523
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:25.870
With hope to find the like event in love,

524
00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:30.100
But prosper better than the Trojan did.

525
00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:35.730
Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;

526
00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:44.370
But I will rule both her, the king and realm.

527
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:42.770
