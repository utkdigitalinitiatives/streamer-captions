WEBVTT

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:28.190
It's cold outside...

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.466
Woman:
Like most adults,

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.801
I've never met a child

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:39.506
that I didn't think was full
of tremendous potential.

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:43.009
And that's
our secret way!

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:45.211
Woman:
The question is, what aspects

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:49.349
of the environment are
invested in the child

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:54.254
being strong, resilient,
confident and capable?

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:56.347
...four, five, six...

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.528
Woman:
What worries me the most

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:04.397
is that I see many instances

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:10.236
where a child has been let down
by the fragility

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:13.331
and inconsistencies
of their environment.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:20.305
Have we decided that we're OK

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.213
with the fragility
of this system?

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:27.079
The fact that
it's gonna fail kids.

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.862
Isn't the investment, early,
in the lives of all children

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:40.400
the long-term investment
in our social well-being

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.994
and success as a society?

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:25.178
Narrator:
To imagine how the

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:28.648
will do tomorrow,
we need only ask

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:31.379
how its children
are doing today.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.190
International data
sounds a warning.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.425
Across multiple dimensions,

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:44.659
the well-being of our children
ranks 26 out of 29 nations.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.102
It all begins in infancy.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.670
Boy:
A baby has a brain!

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.838
We all have brains!

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.941
They make you think...
make you talk...

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:55.875
Girl:
Shelf!

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:57.277
Boy:
Make you walk...

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.779
Here! Come on...

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.481
Man:
The development of the brain

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.183
is laid down
in the early years

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.185
well before children
start school,

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.948
even before they start talking.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.316
Everything starts
from the bottom-up.

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.026
The base holds everything up.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.128
Man:
If we don't do it right early,

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:16.296
it's harder later.

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:17.664
We pay more for it later,

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:19.655
and we don't get as good
an outcome.

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.536
Narrator:
40% of our five year olds

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:26.870
are not ready to learn when
they enter kindergarten.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:34.442
75% of all young adults are not
qualified for military service.

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:39.752
n 1970, the US ranked first

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:43.223
in high school and college
graduation rates.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:47.227
Today we've fallen to 23rd
in high school graduation,

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.559
19th in college graduation.

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:53.533
Man:
We say we're a country

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:55.068
that care about children.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.769
We may care
in some abstract way

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.539
but we won't structure
our economy and our systems

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:00.836
to actually support them.

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:03.076
Woman:
The damage

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:07.447
to our youngest children
is just incalculable,

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:12.476
and the costs to society
therefore are incalculable.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.854
Man:
These children right now

00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:17.357
are three and four,
are going to be 23 and 24

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:18.391
in 20 years.

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:19.552
It's not that far away.

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:22.528
So yes, we have a crisis,

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:24.864
but we have an opportunity
at the same time.

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:26.532
Woman:
As a society,

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:30.470
we have the potential
to do so much more

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.541
than we realize we could do
to support children.

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:40.480
We can win by thinking
as a larger village.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.506
(loudspeaker)

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.386
Narrator:
Dr. Renee Boynton-Jarrett

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:50.590
is a pediatrician and researcher
at Boston Medical Center.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.093
Dr. Renee,
look at my socks!

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:56.062
Pretty scary!

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:57.664
How are things going
at home

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.999
with raising
two little ones?

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:02.902
They're just
growing too fast.

00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:04.304
Every day something new...

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.771
Absolutely, I love it.

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:12.645
Aiden, thinking he's the boss.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.480
So he's the big brother...

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.815
Narrator:
Dr. Boynton-Jarrett

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.684
has supported
four-year-old Aiden

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:20.920
and three-year-old Cara's
development since infancy...

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.356
...very age-appropriate...

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:24.324
Narrator:
...as she has

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:25.416
hundreds of children.

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:28.328
Boynton-Jarrett:
We as a society

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.829
value productivity;

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:33.633
we value engagement
and civic participation.

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:36.035
We value education.

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:38.137
This is an amazing picture.

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:40.373
Boynton-Jarrett:
Often the work that we do

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:42.442
to support those outcomes

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:46.813
occurs very far out
from the time in life

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:50.817
that is laying the foundation
for achieving those outcomes.

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:53.720
One, two, three, four...

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.787
Boynton-Jarrett:
If we look

00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:57.657
at the actual
scientific literature,

00:05:57.657 --> 00:06:00.360
what predicts high school
graduation rate?

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.297
Third grade reading level is
actually a very strong predictor

00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:06.366
of high school graduation.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.168
Well, third grade reading level

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:11.804
is predicted by the number
of words you know

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:13.873
when you're two
or three years old.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.675
Urn, they're dancing...

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:17.377
Boynton-Jarrett:
So what predicts the number

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:20.380
of words you know when
you're two or three years old?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.381
Was he jumping on the bed?

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.648
Boynton-Jarrett:
We can track that back

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:25.218
to the enrichment
of your environment

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:28.154
at the very earliest moments
of your life...

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:31.988
the very earliest stages
of your brain development.

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:35.395
Say, cheese!

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.453
Cheese!

00:06:38.164 --> 00:06:39.832
Narrator:
More than 80 billion

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:41.701
brain cells.

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:44.871
That's how many
a baby is born with.

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:48.674
But it's the connections
between cells that matter.

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:52.879
And most connections
are not yet formed at birth.

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:53.713
Man:
Beginning from

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:57.950
the moment of birth,
new synapses or connections

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.354
between brain cells are being
formed every single second

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:05.425
in all parts of the brain
that are responsible

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:08.961
for everything from being able
to regulate your feelings,

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:11.464
to begin to learn language...

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:12.632
(baby vocalizes)

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:13.599
Oh, yeah?

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.701
Talking to daddy!

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:16.869
...to begin to understand

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:18.638
how to interact
with other children,

00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:20.640
to begin to solve problems...

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.375
She's thinking to herself,

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:25.044
"How do I get it?"

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:27.313
Shonkoff:
Connections that basically

00:07:27.313 --> 00:07:29.916
become the architecture
and the foundation

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:31.281
of who we are as people.

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.822
Narrator:
Johely is four months old.

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:37.590
By the time she is three,

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.326
her brain will have built
trillions more connections

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:44.664
than all the stars
in our galaxy.

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:46.799
Those intricate circuits
start getting paved

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:49.769
into wider, stronger highways,

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:52.738
building the foundation
for more complex skills

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:58.075
like reasoning, impulse control,
even compassion and trust.

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:01.073
How do we play, huh?

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:04.350
Narrator:
But Joheiys brain connections

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.717
aren't built on automatic pilot.

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:09.155
Boynton-Jarrett:
They are reinforced

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:12.284
by characteristics
of your environment.

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:15.795
(speaking Spanish)

00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:18.130
She pay attention
to everything you do...

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:18.961
everything you do.

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:21.868
Boynton-Jarrett:
They are reinforced

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:24.303
by experiences
that you have.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.039
Narrator:
Especially through

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:30.309
the exchange of small
everyday interactions

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:32.505
between an infant
and her caregiver.

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:36.482
You happy, eh?

00:08:36.482 --> 00:08:37.950
Narrator:
One type of exchange,

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.387
called "serve and return,"
is crucial.

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:43.356
You are the most
important people

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.691
in her world right now.

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:46.826
Boynton-Jarrett:
"Serve and return"

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:53.132
is a very powerful interaction
on a biological level.

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:54.667
I see this in clinic
all the time.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:57.303
It's really an amazing
thing to watch.

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:59.238
I'm talking with the parent

00:08:59.238 --> 00:09:01.641
and to get the parent's
attention,

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:03.576
the child babbles...

00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:05.344
(baby vocalizes)

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:08.247
Boynton-Jarrett:
And the parent turns from

00:09:08.247 --> 00:09:11.651
and begins to smile at the child
and encourage them,

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:12.685
say something to them,

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:15.421
the child smiles back
at the parent.

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:19.158
And the child will be delighted
because they've succeeded.

00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:22.929
They've captured the attention
of their parent.

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:26.332
They've gotten this wonderful
engagement

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:32.204
that's reinforcing the way in
which the child is developing.

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:38.911
And the more practice you have
at activating those circuits,

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:42.248
the stronger they become.

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.740
It's a use-it or lose-it
phenomenon.

00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:49.355
Narrator:
But what happens

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:51.791
when a baby doesn't
have that practice,

00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:54.193
when "serve and return"
is limited

00:09:54.193 --> 00:09:57.697
or disrupted or withdrawn?

00:09:57.697 --> 00:09:59.532
Mommy's right here.
Oh, yes!

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:00.900
Narrator:
We can see one important

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.270
response in the classic
Still Face Experiment

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.640
first conducted by Professor
Ed Tronick and colleagues.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.810
Everything new in the room
and she uses it as a way...

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.411
Tronick:
In the Still Face Experiment,

00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:14.580
what the mother did
was she sits down

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.382
and she's playing with her baby.

00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:18.884
Yay, so good!

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:21.487
Tronick:
And then we asked the mother

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:23.512
to not respond to the baby.

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:28.057
The baby very quickly
picks up on this.

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:30.796
(baby vocalizes)

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:33.633
And then she uses
all of her abilities

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.863
to try and get the mother back.

00:10:42.274 --> 00:10:44.076
(baby screams)

00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:44.944
Shonkoff:
I can guarantee you

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:47.113
that baby was not given a course
in child development.

00:10:47.113 --> 00:10:51.083
That baby was not told,
"If you don't get good response,

00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:54.020
do everything you can
to indicate distress."

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.489
Babies pick upon that
right away

00:10:56.489 --> 00:11:01.694
because their brains are wired
to expect responsiveness.

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:03.996
(baby vocalizes)

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:08.134
At a moment that a baby
is not getting responsiveness,

00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:12.938
that is triggering
a stress response.

00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:14.874
Automatically, instantly

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:17.977
our heart rate goes up,
our blood pressure goes up,

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:19.679
our blood sugar goes up,

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:23.649
our inflammatory system
is activated.

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:27.653
It's the basis of the fight
or flight syndrome.

00:11:27.653 --> 00:11:29.087
It's life-preserving.

00:11:31.057 --> 00:11:32.725
Narrator:
When the threat has passed

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:35.895
and a baby feels safe, secure,
and nurtured again,

00:11:35.895 --> 00:11:38.830
her stress reaction
returns to normal.

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:42.735
Shonkoff:
The problem is the chronic

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:45.237
repeated activation
of that stress system

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:48.474
takes allot these
physiological changes

00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:51.010
and over time instead
of being helpful,

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.979
they start to have a wear-
and-tear effect on your body.

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:57.717
(baby cries)

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.485
The parts of the brain
that early on

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:02.521
are associated with memory
and simple learning,

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:06.559
focusing attention, being able
to solve problems.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:10.029
Those parts of the brain are
very vulnerable to disruption

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:12.828
from chronic activation
of the stress system.

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:14.934
Narrator:
In the Still Face Experiment,

00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:16.669
Narrator:
In the Still Face Experiment,

00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:19.338
unresponsiveness
was temporary.

00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:21.107
No harm done.

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:23.075
(baby cries)

00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:26.912
Some stress even promotes
healthy coping skills.

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:28.214
Shonkoff:
The last thing that I would want

00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:31.183
to communicate here to parents
is that they're doing harm

00:12:31.183 --> 00:12:32.084
to their children.

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:34.286
No, they're not doing harm
to their children,

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:36.388
if in the midst of all that

00:12:36.388 --> 00:12:38.791
there's a fair amount
of supportive responsiveness.

00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:41.594
And what are you doing?

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:42.528
Narrator:
Which is what

00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:46.265
this mother restores and what
most parents try to sustain...

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:47.426
I love you.

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:52.605
Narrator:
That's if they can...

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.541
in the midst of the mounting
demands and stressors

00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:57.066
on their daily lives.

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.246
Boynton-Jarrett:
The stressors in the lives

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:03.048
of parents affect attachment,

00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:08.220
they affect the ability to
engage in "serve and return,"

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.923
they affect the ability
to provide

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:14.794
and meet allot the needs
of the child.

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.462
Woman:
It's hard to make

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:17.963
everything work.

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:19.565
You feel pulled
in all different directions.

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:20.566
Woman:
There's this feeling

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:23.769
of constantly being on
a tense, full alert.

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:25.471
It's too much.
I can't do it.

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:26.839
Feeling security...

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:28.474
I don't really know
what that feels like.

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:30.109
(screaming)

00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:31.577
Narrator:
Parents and caregivers

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:34.747
are scrambling to fulfill
their responsibilities

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:39.618
in a society that's unresponsive
to family needs.

00:13:39.618 --> 00:13:41.487
Man:
We've made public problems

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:45.191
into private problems,
without resources.

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:47.259
So you have to fix
everything yourself.

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:48.794
Woman:
Funding was cut.

00:13:48.794 --> 00:13:51.388
We had to close two
or three classrooms.

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:53.999
And so we have parents

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:58.771
who are strapped for time,
for money, for resources.

00:13:58.771 --> 00:13:59.839
Man:
My position

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.107
was transferred overseas.

00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:04.443
We didn't have any income.

00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:06.434
That's any parent's
worst nightmare.

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:10.850
Narrator:
Thirty-five years ago,

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.119
wages were rising in tandem
with productivity,

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:18.290
but since then-while labor
productivity continued to rise -

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.159
the gains of that productivity

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:23.151
have been shared less and
less with average Americans.

00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:28.567
Woman:
He got called in last night

00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:31.434
to pick up another shift
and we need the money.

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:34.640
Narrator:
Over the last 40 years,

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.843
corporate profits reached
record highs.

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:41.814
Middle class wages
have remained stagnant.

00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:44.550
The value of the federal
minimum wage

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.313
has actually fallen.

00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:49.989
You can't survive
on minimum wage

00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:51.490
and take care of two kids.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.059
It's just not possible.

00:14:54.059 --> 00:15:00.866
Narrator:
As wages for most

00:15:00.866 --> 00:15:05.133
and the cost of education
increased eight-fold.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:20.586
Young girl:
Sometimes she cries

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.621
and she's stuck

00:15:22.621 --> 00:15:26.524
and she needs somebody
to help her.

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:33.599
Man:
Parents.

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:36.201
They're the beginning
of the process.

00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:39.772
We do not invest enough
in parents.

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:41.106
I'm Rob Dugger.

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:42.408
I'm a partner in a...

00:15:42.408 --> 00:15:44.243
Narrator:
Rob Dugger is an economist

00:15:44.243 --> 00:15:45.477
and for 15 years,

00:15:45.477 --> 00:15:48.914
was a partner in a multi-billion
dollar hedge fund.

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:50.482
Today he's dedicated

00:15:50.482 --> 00:15:53.285
to persuading policymakers
and business leaders

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:57.756
to improve conditions for young
children and their families.

00:15:57.756 --> 00:15:59.391
Dugger:
When you invest in all kids,

00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:02.127
all families, you get on
a higher growth path -

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:04.830
a growth path which provides
more opportunity,

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.800
more revenues and enables
a sustainable economy

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.032
to generate the kind of jobs
and growth that we need.

00:16:13.672 --> 00:16:15.841
Narrator:
Like Dugger, Art Rolnick

00:16:15.841 --> 00:16:17.676
and a handful of other
leading economists

00:16:17.676 --> 00:16:21.613
have calculated the many
benefits the nation would enjoy

00:16:21.613 --> 00:16:25.851
if its policies assured every
child a strong start.

00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:27.853
Rolnick:
The kids were more likely

00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:29.355
to be literate
by the third grade,

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:33.092
graduate high school, get a job,
pay taxes, stay off welfare,

00:16:33.092 --> 00:16:36.962
and the crime rate between
the two groups goes down 50%.

00:16:36.962 --> 00:16:38.163
Narrator:
They're zeroing in

00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:40.564
on America's family policies.

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:44.703
Dugger:
policies actually

00:16:44.703 --> 00:16:46.772
actively discourage parents

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:48.440
from being able to take care
of their children

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.375
when they're very young.

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:51.210
They may instinctively
want to do it,

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.110
but we don't make it
easy for them.

00:16:53.612 --> 00:16:54.346
That way!

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:55.681
No, you silly girl!

00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:58.050
That's not the way we go,
we go this way.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.185
Narrator:
Ann lives in Boston.

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:04.123
She gave birth to little Syl
just four months ago.

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:05.324
Can you reach it?

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:07.159
Narrator:
She faced the same difficulty

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:08.994
most American parents face

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:11.463
from the moment
their baby is born.

00:17:11.463 --> 00:17:12.164
Ann:
There was no

00:17:12.164 --> 00:17:12.898
paid maternity leave,

00:17:12.898 --> 00:17:15.067
but I'm allowed to use sick
and vacation time

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:16.301
to get pay while I'm out.

00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:19.405
There's no pay just for being
on maternity leave.

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:21.839
Hey, are you awake now?

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.210
Narrator:
Every major economy

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.378
on the planet

00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:29.381
guarantees paid maternity
or family leave,

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:32.384
except the United States.

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:33.886
The result?

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:36.522
40% of new mothers
return to work

00:17:36.522 --> 00:17:39.892
by the time their infants
are only three months old-

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:44.386
some because they want to,
most because they have to.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.266
There you go!
What's that?

00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:49.668
Who are all these people?

00:17:49.668 --> 00:17:50.602
Narrator:
This is little Sylvie's

00:17:50.602 --> 00:17:52.332
first day in child care.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:56.575
She will be here for eight hours
until Ann returns from work.

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:58.510
Here we go, sweetie.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.711
Ann:
I'm going to miss my baby.

00:17:59.711 --> 00:18:02.281
I'm a little bit more of a human
being in this last month

00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:05.417
so I get to actually be awake
and aware of the fact

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:06.618
that I've got this amazing
little thing

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:08.720
who's starting to smile,
and giggle, and coo.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.622
I'd love to spend
more time with her.

00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:12.925
It's just phenomenal to see
every day something changes

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.593
and something's different
that she couldn't do before.

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:17.796
Or we notice that she's crying
in a different way now,

00:18:17.796 --> 00:18:19.765
that it's louder
and her coos are,

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:22.101
they sound different than
they did a week ago.

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:23.368
And what does that mean?

00:18:23.368 --> 00:18:24.603
I don't know,
is that vocal chords?

00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:26.271
Is that something different?

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:30.242
But it's exciting to see her
do something more every time.

00:18:30.242 --> 00:18:33.745
So you can just her little brain
working, "What? Oh, ooh!"

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:34.880
As a mother,

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.407
it's the little things
that make you go, "Oh, yay!"

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:41.987
Narrator:
If Ann lived 250 miles north

00:18:41.987 --> 00:18:43.455
in Quebec, Canada,

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:47.459
she and her husband could
share 9 months of paid leave;

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:53.599
in Germany, 14 months;
in Hungary, more than 2 years.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:56.301
With the exception
of three states,

00:18:56.301 --> 00:18:59.471
parents in the US are
guaranteed only 12 weeks

00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:01.840
of unpaid family leave,

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.943
and then only if a parent
has worked for a company

00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:10.516
of 50 or more employees
for at least a year.

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:14.286
Even these benefits
were hard won...

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:18.090
the result of a 9-year battle
waged by family advocates,

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.592
beginning in the 1980s.

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:22.494
At the time, the number
of mothers

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:25.998
with young children in the
workforce was soaring.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:28.500
But in most states,
a woman could be fired

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.103
if she took time off
to have a baby.

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:32.938
Woman:
Newborns need their parents

00:19:32.938 --> 00:19:34.840
and their parents
need their jobs...

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.875
We see the effects of stress

00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:39.011
on the mental health
of family members...

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:43.282
They face job loss, soaring
health insurance costs...

00:19:43.282 --> 00:19:44.983
Narrator:
Family advocates proposed

00:19:44.983 --> 00:19:47.186
only unpaid leave.

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:48.787
Woman:
We eliminated the idea

00:19:48.787 --> 00:19:50.355
of going for paid leave,

00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:54.159
not because none of us
wanted paid leave;

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:59.865
but because it was so beyond
what people thought politically,

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.856
realistically we could get.

00:20:03.335 --> 00:20:04.369
Narrator:
But even the idea

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:05.904
of unpaid leave

00:20:05.904 --> 00:20:08.707
brought fierce opposition
from the business community

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:11.343
and its political supporters.

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:12.811
Man:
Don't force the benefits

00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:14.846
down our throat
or theirs.

00:20:14.846 --> 00:20:18.817
I am not opposed to babies
or mothers or fathers.

00:20:18.817 --> 00:20:21.853
The real issue here is whether
the programs described

00:20:21.853 --> 00:20:23.522
should be federally mandated.

00:20:23.522 --> 00:20:25.390
This very bill,
this mandated bill,

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.926
will impose such costs
on American business

00:20:27.926 --> 00:20:31.063
that it will render them even
more unable to compete

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:32.564
in the world economy.

00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:35.267
We were going to bring down
the free enterprise system

00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:36.268
as you know it.

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:38.437
We were going
to end capitalism.

00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:42.207
I can show you the same quotes
when we talked about legislation

00:20:42.207 --> 00:20:46.778
to ban child labor,
to establish a minimum

00:20:46.778 --> 00:20:49.247
The sky will fall.
It will kill jobs.

00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:52.618
Narrator:
Twice the Family

00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:53.585
and Medical Leave Act,

00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:56.388
or FMLA,
was passed by Congress.

00:20:56.388 --> 00:20:59.551
Twice it went down
to presidential veto.

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:01.793
The objection?

00:21:01.793 --> 00:21:05.130
Government intrusion in the
so-called private business...

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.097
of business.

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:08.267
Dugger:
The most powerful

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:10.936
political voice
in the United States

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:13.605
is the American
business community.

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.641
Without question.
Always has been.

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:21.413
Most of corporate America
is short-term decision-making

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:22.914
because the bottom line

00:21:22.914 --> 00:21:25.083
gets converted immediately
into profits

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:27.719
that gets immediately
converted into stock price,

00:21:27.719 --> 00:21:30.155
translated immediately
into values

00:21:30.155 --> 00:21:33.058
of tens of thousands
of stockholders.

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:36.662
a consequence of the
of short-termism

00:21:36.662 --> 00:21:41.767
that is pervading our economy,
pervading our politics,

00:21:41.767 --> 00:21:47.806
we are opting to make the wrong
decisions very consistently.

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:49.408
The wrong decisions

00:21:49.408 --> 00:21:54.513
for the lifetime success
of our American kids.

00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:57.149
(applause)

00:21:57.149 --> 00:22:02.621
This is a very poignant moment
and my heart is very full...

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:04.489
Narrator:
Congress passed the FMLA

00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:05.691
a third time

00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:10.495
and it was finally signed
into law in 1993.

00:22:10.495 --> 00:22:13.965
Even its advocates
were disappointed.

00:22:13.965 --> 00:22:14.933
Bravo:
First of all,

00:22:14.933 --> 00:22:16.501
half the workforce isn't covered

00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:18.003
by the Family
and Medical Leave Act.

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:20.605
And most of all, it's unpaid!

00:22:20.605 --> 00:22:23.942
So every year you have
nearly three million people

00:22:23.942 --> 00:22:26.978
who are eligible for family
and medical leave

00:22:26.978 --> 00:22:29.314
and can't afford to take it.

00:22:29.314 --> 00:22:31.510
You have a good day,
little one!

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.955
Woman:
When you understand that

00:22:36.955 --> 00:22:40.158
those first few months
or that first year of life

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:42.060
when the mother needs
to provide

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:46.865
that very sensitive caretaking,

00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:51.069
to not provide with policy
what women need to choose

00:22:51.069 --> 00:22:52.671
how to do that for themselves

00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:56.475
is saying that you're gonna not
pay careful enough attention

00:22:56.475 --> 00:22:57.203
to these children.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.012
Boynton-Jarrett:
Is this a safe world?

00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:09.721
What will happen
when I feel afraid?

00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:11.723
What will happen
when I feel hungry?

00:23:11.723 --> 00:23:14.192
What will happen
when I feel scared?

00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:19.295
Can I count on you?

00:23:21.666 --> 00:23:25.003
Stressors that a parent
may feel

00:23:25.003 --> 00:23:27.672
that they do not have
adequate resources

00:23:27.672 --> 00:23:31.410
to buffer or cope with can be
experienced by the child

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.378
or influence
the child's well-being.

00:23:37.182 --> 00:23:37.949
Essex:
There's no doubt

00:23:37.949 --> 00:23:41.386
about the fact that
if a parent is stressed,

00:23:41.386 --> 00:23:43.555
that it affects the child.

00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:45.056
There's no doubt about that.

00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:46.758
We're talking
about processes here

00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:49.022
that are at a biological level.

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:55.133
Narrator:
How could parental stress

00:23:55.133 --> 00:23:57.536
during pregnancy
and the first years of life

00:23:57.536 --> 00:24:03.275
leave a lasting biological
imprint on a child?

00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:05.577
That's the question
Professor Marilyn Essex

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:07.045
and dozens of colleagues

00:24:07.045 --> 00:24:09.381
at the University
of Wisconsin-Madison

00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:13.418
have been asking in a
ground-breaking 20-year study.

00:24:13.418 --> 00:24:14.619
Essex:
Our basic hypothesis

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:17.556
was women needing
to go back to work

00:24:17.556 --> 00:24:19.724
for financial reasons sooner
than they were ready

00:24:19.724 --> 00:24:21.293
was not good for either them

00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:22.954
or their families
or the babies.

00:24:24.763 --> 00:24:25.764
Narrator:
The study recruited

00:24:25.764 --> 00:24:28.433
more than 500
expectant parents,

00:24:28.433 --> 00:24:31.803
mostly white
and mostly middle class.

00:24:31.803 --> 00:24:34.573
By the time the babies
were four months old,

00:24:34.573 --> 00:24:37.742
data showed a pattern
starting to emerge.

00:24:37.742 --> 00:24:38.810
Essex:
They were stressed.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.745
They were stressed
economically,

00:24:40.745 --> 00:24:43.849
they were stressed
by having to work two jobs.

00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:45.517
That's when they showed
a lot less

00:24:45.517 --> 00:24:47.953
of that kind of sensitive
and contingent behavior

00:24:47.953 --> 00:24:50.188
that is really, really important
for moms

00:24:50.188 --> 00:24:52.816
to show with their babies
to have healthy babies.

00:24:55.293 --> 00:24:56.428
Narrator:
When the children

00:24:56.428 --> 00:25:00.198
were two years old,
the study widened its lens.

00:25:00.198 --> 00:25:02.767
Essex:
We began to turn our attention

00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:03.768
to say now let's look

00:25:03.768 --> 00:25:05.670
at longer-term effects
on the child.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.105
But we broadened it to say,

00:25:07.105 --> 00:25:09.341
let's look at stress
more generally.

00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:10.876
Woman:
The things that we tapped

00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:13.478
were financial stress.

00:25:13.478 --> 00:25:16.281
We also look at role overload.

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:17.649
One of the big issues is time

00:25:17.649 --> 00:25:19.484
and making sure you have time
with your children

00:25:19.484 --> 00:25:22.317
and the resources to give
your children a good life.

00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:25.824
Narrator:
Would early life parental stress

00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:27.359
continue to have an impact

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:30.795
on the parents' children
as they grew up?

00:25:30.795 --> 00:25:31.530
To find out,

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:34.566
the Wisconsin team measured
the presence of Cortisol

00:25:34.566 --> 00:25:37.736
in the children's saliva
when they were four.

00:25:37.736 --> 00:25:41.104
We do have a freezer full
of saliva samples.

00:25:42.707 --> 00:25:43.808
That's pretty

00:25:43.808 --> 00:25:44.910
Essex:
We had what we called

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.144
"family spit times"

00:25:46.144 --> 00:25:47.479
where the mom, the dad,
and the child,

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:49.814
they would spit at the end
of the day.

00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:51.146
And the kids thought
this was a lot of fun.

00:25:52.183 --> 00:25:54.419
Narrator:
Cortisol is a powerful hormone

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:56.021
whose presence in saliva

00:25:56.021 --> 00:25:59.090
indicates activation
of the stress response.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.825
Burgh y:
What we see is

00:26:00.825 --> 00:26:03.662
that when moms are reporting
a high level of stress

00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:05.061
in the first year of life...

00:26:07.032 --> 00:26:09.768
as their child gets older,

00:26:09.768 --> 00:26:12.370
if we look at their Cortisol
late in the day,

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.532
we see that they have
higher Cortisol levels.

00:26:15.941 --> 00:26:17.208
Essex:
And then those kids

00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:19.177
with the higher levels
of the stress hormone

00:26:19.177 --> 00:26:22.213
had more difficulties
adjusting to school.

00:26:22.213 --> 00:26:23.545
(baby cries)

00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:27.352
They tended to be
more anxious...

00:26:27.352 --> 00:26:29.120
Come on, Buddy,
let's come...

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.417
Essex:
...kind of withdraw.

00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:35.060
They tended also to be
more impulsive;

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.696
they tended to be
more aggressive.

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:41.223
They had a wide variety
of behavior problems.

00:26:43.702 --> 00:26:45.236
Narrator:
Another fourteen years

00:26:45.236 --> 00:26:48.807
of evaluations, videotaping,
and testing followed.

00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:51.943
...from the preschool
through first grade.

00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:54.212
In the file cabinets
are the records

00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:57.382
from the third grade
through middle school.

00:26:57.382 --> 00:27:01.119
We're going to run
a short localizer scan now...

00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:03.154
Narrator:
Recently, new neuro-imaging

00:27:03.154 --> 00:27:05.290
technology enabled
the Wisconsin team

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:06.658
to see whether or not

00:27:06.658 --> 00:27:09.794
parental stress might impact
the very architecture

00:27:09.794 --> 00:27:12.831
of their adolescent
children's brains.

00:27:12.831 --> 00:27:14.666
The team especially
wanted to look

00:27:14.666 --> 00:27:17.736
at one critical brain circuit-

00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:22.240
the connection between the
amygdala and prefrontal cortex.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.911
The amygdala recognizes
threat and sounds the alarm.

00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:30.949
In turn, the prefrontal cortex
signals the amygdala

00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:34.352
whether the alarm is justified.

00:27:34.352 --> 00:27:35.787
Burgh y:
We want to see a good flow

00:27:35.787 --> 00:27:37.455
of traffic on that highway

00:27:37.455 --> 00:27:39.624
because that's a highway
that's helping that child

00:27:39.624 --> 00:27:43.028
regulate their emotion on
a moment-to-moment basis -

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:44.763
how to deal with emotions,

00:27:44.763 --> 00:27:47.866
when is it appropriate
to express emotions,

00:27:47.866 --> 00:27:50.602
what are good things to feel,
what are bad things to feel.

00:27:50.602 --> 00:27:51.936
So we can get right
in the middle

00:27:51.936 --> 00:27:52.837
of the amygdala there.

00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:54.706
That looks fantastic.

00:27:54.706 --> 00:27:56.608
Narrator:
So, was there a difference

00:27:56.608 --> 00:28:00.045
in these two parts of the brain
in those adolescents

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:02.614
who had experienced
early-life parental stress?

00:28:02.614 --> 00:28:04.649
(machine beeps loudly)

00:28:04.649 --> 00:28:05.717
Burgh y:
When we look at it now

00:28:05.717 --> 00:28:09.354
that they're 18 years old,
we see lower connectivity

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:12.490
between the amygdala
and prefrontal cortex.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:13.291
Essex:
For the kids

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:16.828
with early stress exposure,
it was just way out of whack.

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:18.163
What we found was a pattern

00:28:18.163 --> 00:28:20.331
that absolutely fits
with the rest of our data.

00:28:20.331 --> 00:28:23.535
Burgh y:
It was an amazing thing to see

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:26.129
and to see such strong
associations throughout.

00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:30.041
And this whole pattern

00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:35.046
then predicted anxiety
in these adolescent girls.

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:36.915
It really is setting up a system

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:40.251
that responds differently
to stress in the future.

00:28:40.251 --> 00:28:41.486
Burgh y:
When we're stressed out,

00:28:41.486 --> 00:28:43.855
we're not taking in
as much information;

00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:46.024
we're not functioning
as well in our daily lives.

00:28:46.024 --> 00:28:47.392
We might be getting
everything done

00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:49.360
but maybe we're not
learning as well.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.663
Essex:
And so it does have an effect

00:28:51.663 --> 00:28:54.566
on later achievement
and academic outcomes.

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:56.735
In terms of health
and functioning,

00:28:56.735 --> 00:29:00.364
we know that they do worse
than kids who are less stressed.

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:04.209
Narrator:
And the ball can keep bouncing.

00:29:04.209 --> 00:29:08.446
These adolescents
are America's future parents.

00:29:08.446 --> 00:29:10.181
Essex:
For the girls in our study

00:29:10.181 --> 00:29:12.917
who have been exposed
to a lot of early life stress

00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:15.086
and who have some kind
of dysregulation

00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:17.222
in their stress response system,

00:29:17.222 --> 00:29:19.290
that prenatal environment
for their child

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:23.128
is going to be different
and puts that child at risk.

00:29:23.128 --> 00:29:26.928
Then that continues generation
after generation.

00:29:34.472 --> 00:29:37.208
Ok, you gotta wait
until I'm done.

00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:38.543
Oh, the rice isn't done.

00:29:38.543 --> 00:29:39.811
Narrator:
Fast on the heels

00:29:39.811 --> 00:29:41.212
of their child's birth,

00:29:41.212 --> 00:29:44.082
parents confront
another stressful obstacle...

00:29:44.082 --> 00:29:45.884
Alright, Naham, we're coming!

00:29:45.884 --> 00:29:47.318
Narrator:
...the lack of quality,

00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:49.254
affordable childcare.

00:29:49.254 --> 00:29:50.421
Man:
We were first looking

00:29:50.421 --> 00:29:53.258
at daycare when
Yaminette was pregnant.

00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:54.225
For over a year...

00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:58.062
Narrator:
Of forty-five nations,

00:29:58.062 --> 00:30:02.634
the United States ranks 31st
in availability of childcare,

00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:05.103
16th in affordability,

00:30:05.103 --> 00:30:08.239
and most alarmingly for
our children's development,

00:30:08.239 --> 00:30:11.232
22nd in quality.

00:30:11.576 --> 00:30:12.577
I love you, brother!

00:30:12.577 --> 00:30:13.645
Narrator:
Yaminette and David

00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:16.247
are just starting life
as a family,

00:30:16.247 --> 00:30:18.516
raising their son Naham
and daughter Nikha.

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:20.685
Naham:
...trying to find it...

00:30:20.685 --> 00:30:21.986
Yaminette:
Tomorrow's a hectic day.

00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:22.954
I have a training.

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:25.657
I have to be there at 9 o'clock.

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:26.925
Narrator:
Yaminette works full-time

00:30:26.925 --> 00:30:28.293
and more...

00:30:28.293 --> 00:30:30.595
Yaminette:
I bring work home with me.

00:30:30.595 --> 00:30:34.332
It's just what I do so that
I don't feel as overwhelmed.

00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:35.466
You need a fruit, Naham.

00:30:35.466 --> 00:30:36.534
Raspberries?

00:30:36.534 --> 00:30:38.469
Narrator:
David is on a fast track

00:30:38.469 --> 00:30:40.138
to finishing his education.

00:30:40.138 --> 00:30:41.806
Yaminette:
I'm the breadwinner.

00:30:41.806 --> 00:30:43.208
I'm the sugar mama.

00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:44.809
Hi, honey!

00:30:44.809 --> 00:30:47.545
Are you ready to try
something new?

00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:49.013
David:
The clock is ticking.

00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:51.482
The clock's ticking because
your bank account's running low,

00:30:51.482 --> 00:30:53.351
the clock's ticking because
you gotta build your career,

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:55.720
but also,
once you have kids,

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.655
you really want to invest
in those early years,

00:30:57.655 --> 00:30:59.988
you don't want to treat
that time cheaply.

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:02.026
Narrator:
Most parents don't want

00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:03.695
to think of their
baby's well-being

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:07.065
in terms of dollars,
but how can they not?

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:10.902
Nationwide, center-based
childcare generally averages

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:14.463
more than $10,000
a year per child.

00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:17.141
Yaminette:
With Naham, our first,

00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:21.079
we've consistently paid more
for childcare than for rent.

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:22.180
Oh, yeah.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.348
Yaminette:
With Nikha,

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:27.151
my name's on the waiting
list at two places.

00:31:27.151 --> 00:31:30.088
For Ellis, we were told
we're around number 40.

00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:34.389
I'm really, really holding out
for Ellis.

00:31:36.327 --> 00:31:37.829
Narrator:
Ellis is Ellis Memorial

00:31:37.829 --> 00:31:39.597
Child Development Center -

00:31:39.597 --> 00:31:42.367
one of Boston's best
and most affordable.

00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:45.203
Where's Henry?

00:31:45.203 --> 00:31:46.337
There's Henry!

00:31:46.337 --> 00:31:49.398
Narrator:
Demand for a spot here is high.

00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:52.043
Woman:
This is our wait list

00:31:52.043 --> 00:31:56.247
and this is the waitlist
just for infants and toddlers.

00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:57.515
It's that crazy,

00:31:57.515 --> 00:31:59.050
but it's a different world
that we live in.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:00.415
They have to get to work.

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:03.721
Woman:
Now you guys are going to think

00:32:03.721 --> 00:32:06.224
about what
you're thankful for.

00:32:06.224 --> 00:32:08.393
Cyanne, do you want
to share?

00:32:08.393 --> 00:32:10.061
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:11.222
That's okay.

00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:13.264
Narrator:
Ellis provides nurturing,

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:14.933
child-centered care

00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:17.527
by skilled teachers,
like Aiyauna Terry.

00:32:19.237 --> 00:32:20.571
Would you like to share?

00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:23.308
Go ahead, Lilly,
what are you thankful for?

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:26.110
My mommy and my daddy...

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.479
Terry:
That future inventor,

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:32.450
doctor, nurse,
whatever this child could be,

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.720
now is the time that
their brains are at work.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.121
And can you tell him

00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:39.257
where the road is
to take you?

00:32:39.257 --> 00:32:42.794
It's gonna take you to Boston
all the way down here.

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:43.661
Narrator:
Teachers are

00:32:43.661 --> 00:32:45.463
rigorously evaluated.

00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:47.598
Ellis is safe, clean,

00:32:47.598 --> 00:32:52.337
and offers a stimulating
environment for the early years.

00:32:52.337 --> 00:32:55.907
It's not only licensed,
it's nationally accredited.

00:32:55.907 --> 00:32:57.909
(pretends to scream)

00:32:57.909 --> 00:33:03.114
(children laugh)

00:33:03.114 --> 00:33:04.449
Heckman:
Childcare can't be

00:33:04.449 --> 00:33:05.950
some kind of warehouse,

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:09.787
because it's more than
just taking care of the child

00:33:09.787 --> 00:33:11.022
for eight hours a day.

00:33:11.022 --> 00:33:12.623
I need to find a wig for that.

00:33:12.623 --> 00:33:14.359
Should I wear a curly wig?

00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:15.860
Heckman:
Quality early childhood program

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.463
is an opportunity to invest
in the child

00:33:18.463 --> 00:33:20.498
and to promote
the capabilities of the child.

00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:22.133
Woman:
Who are you?

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:23.668
Fireman!

00:33:23.668 --> 00:33:25.370
Narrator:
Studies by Heckman, Art Rolnick,

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.205
and others show that children

00:33:27.205 --> 00:33:31.209
who receive high quality care
are on average better educated,

00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:34.779
healthier, more productive,
and earn higher pay...

00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:36.314
Fire! Fire!

00:33:36.314 --> 00:33:38.282
Oh, where is there a fire?

00:33:38.282 --> 00:33:40.184
Way over there!

00:33:40.184 --> 00:33:41.452
Narrator:
...While lowering the cost

00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:45.456
to society of unemployment,
social services, health care,

00:33:45.456 --> 00:33:47.458
and incarceration.

00:33:47.458 --> 00:33:48.826
Heckman:
These kids actually have

00:33:48.826 --> 00:33:50.728
what economists call
a rate of return.

00:33:50.728 --> 00:33:55.733
For each dollar invested,
you get back 7% to 10%,

00:33:55.733 --> 00:33:58.870
somewhere between 7%
and 10% per annum

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:00.538
over the lifetime of the child.

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:03.307
Which is a huge rate of return.

00:34:03.307 --> 00:34:05.643
In the US stock market,
a good portfolio,

00:34:05.643 --> 00:34:10.048
an average portfolio
would earn about 6% a year.

00:34:10.048 --> 00:34:13.651
if you were a financial
planner, investor,

00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:15.987
or if you were a government
or somebody asking,

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:17.522
"Where should I put my money?

00:34:17.522 --> 00:34:19.991
In the stock market
or in a young child?"

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:22.790
You'd say in a young child.

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:25.530
Narrator:
But that's not where the nation

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:27.165
is investing.

00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:28.499
Across the country,

00:34:28.499 --> 00:34:33.438
only one in 10 childcare centers
is accredited.

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:34.705
n California,

00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:38.164
cemeteries are inspected more
often than childcare centers.

00:34:39.544 --> 00:34:43.742
Staff training is often not
required and oversight is lax.

00:34:45.683 --> 00:34:49.020
The annual median wage
for American's childcare workers

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:53.891
in 2013 was only $19,600-

00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:56.724
less than poverty level
for a family of three.

00:34:57.929 --> 00:34:59.920
Are your dinosaurs
joining us?

00:35:01.532 --> 00:35:03.234
Yaminette:
The backup plan is

00:35:03.234 --> 00:35:04.497
to get into Ellis.

00:35:06.037 --> 00:35:08.973
And if, come September,
that doesn't work out,

00:35:08.973 --> 00:35:12.102
then David and I will figure
something else out...

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.445
Stack 'em up for her.

00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:15.279
One, two...

00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:17.248
Narrator:
Yaminette and David,

00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:19.383
and millions
of American parents,

00:35:19.383 --> 00:35:22.220
would not have to
“figure something else out”

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.821
if the nation had done

00:35:23.821 --> 00:35:27.883
what it was on the verge
of doing almost 45 years ago.

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:33.297
Back in 1971,
Congress passed legislation

00:35:33.297 --> 00:35:37.568
called the Comprehensive Child
Development Act or CCDA.

00:35:37.568 --> 00:35:41.339
It offered universal, high
quality childcare, preschool,

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:45.009
and other services for children
from birth to age five

00:35:45.009 --> 00:35:48.468
to any and every American
family that wanted them.

00:35:50.414 --> 00:35:53.484
The legislation awaited
only a presidential signature

00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:54.815
to become law.

00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:57.155
Reporter:
The word is now

00:35:57.155 --> 00:35:58.689
that the Administration
will announce

00:35:58.689 --> 00:36:00.358
its position next week.

00:36:00.358 --> 00:36:03.919
And the day of daycare may
be approaching in America.

00:36:06.264 --> 00:36:08.166
Narrator:
But opponents recast the bill

00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:09.834
as government intrusion

00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:14.066
into the individual rights and
responsibilities of the family.

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.508
And at the 11th hour,

00:36:17.508 --> 00:36:19.670
President Nixon
vetoed the bill.

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:25.683
Since the veto,
millions of families have gone

00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:28.452
without the kind of quality,
affordable care

00:36:28.452 --> 00:36:30.853
all young children need
to flourish.

00:36:37.728 --> 00:36:40.631
But one of America's
largest employers

00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:43.801
does receive federal funding
to provide high quality,

00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:47.171
affordable childcare
to its employees' families.

00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:51.842
It regards that care as
a top organizational priority.

00:36:51.842 --> 00:36:53.411
Man:
The most important thing to us

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:57.048
is always that our families
are taken care of.

00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:59.417
If our families
are taken care of,

00:36:59.417 --> 00:37:01.052
there's a sense
of security out there

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:02.186
that we don't have to worry
about them

00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:04.388
and we can concentrate
on the mission.

00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:06.550
(engine roar)

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:10.828
Narrator:
Here at Camp Pendleton,

00:37:10.828 --> 00:37:12.763
Marine families can send
their children

00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:16.934
to high quality on-base
child development centers.

00:37:16.934 --> 00:37:19.503
And not just at Camp Pendleton.

00:37:19.503 --> 00:37:22.707
The same is available to
every branch of the military,

00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:26.944
to all military personnel
regardless of rank.

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:28.779
Show daddy!

00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:29.947
Narrator:
Here fees are based

00:37:29.947 --> 00:37:31.682
on a sliding scale.

00:37:31.682 --> 00:37:33.217
Man:
We looked at everything

00:37:33.217 --> 00:37:36.087
from a nanny to a daycare
out in town.

00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:37.688
We wouldn't have been
able to afford it.

00:37:37.688 --> 00:37:39.457
Our non-military friends,

00:37:39.457 --> 00:37:42.260
they're amazed that we only
pay what we pay.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:46.931
Woman:
Hi, Caleb! Hi, Caleb!

00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:48.432
What is that?

00:37:48.432 --> 00:37:50.268
(baby vocalizes)

00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:51.202
Narrator:
Childcare workers

00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:53.271
receive continuous training

00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:56.207
and here they are paid
about 50% more

00:37:56.207 --> 00:37:58.909
than the national
civilian median.

00:37:58.909 --> 00:38:00.311
Woman:
We also have our

00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:02.947
child assessment portfolio.

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:06.383
And we communicate daily
with our parents.

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:11.822
Are you guys all going
down for naps?

00:38:11.822 --> 00:38:13.090
Narrator:
All centers undergo

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.792
regular surprise inspections.

00:38:14.792 --> 00:38:17.395
And most all are accredited.

00:38:17.395 --> 00:38:19.630
Here we go.
Would you like to be covered?

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.724
Narrator:
But it wasn't always this way.

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:26.504
In 1982, a scathing report

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:28.506
found that
the military's childcare

00:38:28.506 --> 00:38:30.633
was among the worst
in the nation.

00:38:35.112 --> 00:38:37.148
So in 1989,

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:42.253
18 years after the CCDA would
have become law for civilians,

00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:46.155
Congress passed the Military
Child Care Act.

00:38:48.092 --> 00:38:51.095
Military childcare is now
widely recognized

00:38:51.095 --> 00:38:53.063
as among the best
in the nation.

00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:55.299
Give me a kiss.

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:56.667
Woman:
I don't know if I could

00:38:56.667 --> 00:39:00.171
transition them into
a civilian CDC after being here.

00:39:00.171 --> 00:39:02.473
I don't think anything
can compare

00:39:02.473 --> 00:39:03.974
to the care you get here.

00:39:03.974 --> 00:39:05.067
There we go!

00:39:05.443 --> 00:39:06.777
Narrator:
If we as a nation

00:39:06.777 --> 00:39:11.315
can support the families who
protect our national security,

00:39:11.315 --> 00:39:13.217
why not our civilian workforce

00:39:13.217 --> 00:39:16.187
which protects
our national prosperity

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:19.523
and their children who will
advance our future health,

00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:21.025
equity and success?

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:21.192
Big jump!

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:22.493
Big jump!

00:39:22.493 --> 00:39:24.985
I didn't need your help!

00:39:26.397 --> 00:39:27.665
Dugger:
We talk about people

00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:30.468
should be able to succeed
on their own.

00:39:30.468 --> 00:39:32.536
This is what this country's
all about.

00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:34.572
But we make it very,
very difficult

00:39:34.572 --> 00:39:35.835
for most of our population.

00:39:40.244 --> 00:39:42.713
Boynton-Jarrett:
Parents are working really hard

00:39:42.713 --> 00:39:48.986
to care for their children,
to support their families,

00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:52.523
to be engaged
and productive citizens

00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:54.184
and members of the community.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.862
At the same point in time,

00:39:57.862 --> 00:40:01.798
it can be like the dice
are loaded against them.

00:40:04.502 --> 00:40:06.003
Dugger:
The set of workforce policies

00:40:06.003 --> 00:40:10.805
we now have in place are
a crushing burden on parents.

00:40:12.009 --> 00:40:13.110
Narrator:
Maintaining family

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.845
and work-life balance is one

00:40:14.845 --> 00:40:17.915
of American parents'
greatest stressors.

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:19.717
DaNayah?

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:21.419
Narrator:
With the overwhelming majority

00:40:21.419 --> 00:40:23.954
of our youngest children
living in households

00:40:23.954 --> 00:40:28.859
where all resident adults work,
this is a critical concern.

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:31.595
Woman:
I work 40 hours a week.

00:40:31.595 --> 00:40:33.864
Leroy works sometimes
60 hours a week.

00:40:33.864 --> 00:40:35.132
He works a split shift,

00:40:35.132 --> 00:40:38.202
so like 2:00 in the afternoon
to about...

00:40:38.202 --> 00:40:38.602
When I'm done.

00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:39.804
1:00, 2:00 in the morning.

00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:42.740
Narrator:
Leroy is a driver and mechanic.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:51.615
Erica, a nurse.

00:40:51.615 --> 00:40:55.419
than most all
of our peer nations.

00:40:55.419 --> 00:40:57.321
In today's day,
we all gotta work.

00:40:57.321 --> 00:40:59.957
I can remember back
in like my grandfather's days,

00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:02.726
the men work,
the ladies, the women stay home

00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:04.061
and take care of the house

00:41:04.061 --> 00:41:05.496
and family things like that.

00:41:05.496 --> 00:41:08.466
In today's day,
it surely can't happen.

00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:09.967
Everybody's gotta go
and work

00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:12.603
and, you know
what I'm saying, bring it in.

00:41:12.603 --> 00:41:13.771
Narrator:
A growing percentage

00:41:13.771 --> 00:41:17.074
of Americans work unreliable,
precarious schedules,

00:41:17.074 --> 00:41:19.143
which can change
from week to week

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:21.236
depending on
employers' demands.

00:41:23.447 --> 00:41:28.185
I do rotating nights,
so I'm on nights this week,

00:41:28.185 --> 00:41:30.321
so then next week
though I'll be on days.

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:32.923
So it kind of balances
out that way...

00:41:32.923 --> 00:41:34.325
Da-da!

00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:37.995
Boynton-Jarrett:
Parents are juggling, shifting,

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:41.966
trying to balance a variety
of competing demands

00:41:41.966 --> 00:41:44.502
that there just don't seem like

00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:47.638
there are easy
or reasonable solutions.

00:41:47.638 --> 00:41:51.942
It leads to a level
of tension and stress.

00:41:51.942 --> 00:41:55.546
Is this what we've decided
as a society,

00:41:55.546 --> 00:41:58.482
that this degree of tension,

00:41:58.482 --> 00:42:04.788
these complex trade-offs
are the norm, to be expected,

00:42:04.788 --> 00:42:07.280
just a part of raising a child?

00:42:09.059 --> 00:42:11.195
Narrator:
America's work policies

00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:13.364
fail to offer relief.

00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:15.733
The United States
is the only rich nation

00:42:15.733 --> 00:42:17.801
that does not guarantee by law

00:42:17.801 --> 00:42:21.739
a single paid vacation day
or holiday.

00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:23.307
Erica:
My mom still works

00:42:23.307 --> 00:42:24.575
40 hours a week.

00:42:24.575 --> 00:42:26.343
But she helps out when she can.

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:29.179
She's a little active for me
to leave her with her now.

00:42:29.179 --> 00:42:33.183
But I also have a sister
who has two boys

00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:36.487
and she's totally stepped
up to the plate.

00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:38.255
That helped a lot.

00:42:38.255 --> 00:42:39.690
If I'm not there,

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:43.427
I'm entrusting someone else
to keep her safe, to teach her,

00:42:43.427 --> 00:42:47.531
to help her grow in all areas,
developmental^, spiritually.

00:42:47.531 --> 00:42:50.701
We have that,
I call it "the village."

00:42:50.701 --> 00:42:52.002
If they laugh at me at work,

00:42:52.002 --> 00:42:52.937
they're like,
"Who has the baby?"

00:42:52.937 --> 00:42:54.538
I'm like,
"Someone in the village!"

00:42:54.538 --> 00:42:56.871
That kind of thing,
because we can't do it alone.

00:42:57.508 --> 00:42:58.876
Do you want to
go far out?

00:42:58.876 --> 00:43:01.211
Yeah, all the way.

00:43:01.211 --> 00:43:02.446
Up, up, and up.

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:05.082
Shonkoff:
Nobody does this alone.

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:07.312
Nobody does this in isolation.

00:43:08.519 --> 00:43:12.080
The environment that
the family lives in matters.

00:43:13.857 --> 00:43:15.893
Boynton-Jarrett:
Neighborhoods may simply

00:43:15.893 --> 00:43:19.763
not have an adequate
opportunity structure

00:43:19.763 --> 00:43:22.099
to support the families
optimally

00:43:22.099 --> 00:43:24.158
and the children optimally.

00:43:27.237 --> 00:43:29.073
Narrator:
Erica, Leroyand DeNayah

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:32.242
live in the Boston neighborhood
of Mattapan...

00:43:32.242 --> 00:43:33.577
Erica:
You made it?

00:43:33.577 --> 00:43:34.544
Yeah!

00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:36.747
Narrator:
...which has struggled

00:43:36.747 --> 00:43:40.775
with disinvestment and racial
segregation for decades.

00:43:42.052 --> 00:43:45.579
Here unemployment is more
than twice the national average.

00:43:48.092 --> 00:43:52.463
The banks have thrown
500 homes into foreclosure.

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.098
(car horn)

00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:58.933
One in five adults here reports
living in persistent sadness.

00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:05.809
Powell:
Some people live

00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:09.113
in neighborhoods where there
are not good schools,

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:11.448
where there's no tax base,

00:44:11.448 --> 00:44:14.018
that's the structure
that they live in

00:44:14.018 --> 00:44:17.988
and when we look at how we've
structured race in America,

00:44:17.988 --> 00:44:20.524
blacks and Latinos
are more likely

00:44:20.524 --> 00:44:21.925
to live in those structures.

00:44:21.925 --> 00:44:23.460
And if you live
in that structure,

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.329
your life outcomes
are severely truncated.

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:31.602
We know that if we take
the same family

00:44:31.602 --> 00:44:33.704
and expose them to
high opportunity areas,

00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:35.297
the kids will do better.

00:44:37.307 --> 00:44:38.208
Heckman:
What we've seen

00:44:38.208 --> 00:44:41.845
is a tremendous disparity,
a growing disparity

00:44:41.845 --> 00:44:44.148
between the haves
and the have-nots,

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:47.818
and with it, disparities in the
environments of the children,

00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:49.853
so for the next generation,
so it looks bad.

00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:51.789
And the problem is

00:44:51.789 --> 00:44:54.224
that if we don't address
those inequalities,

00:44:54.224 --> 00:44:58.195
we're gonna find ourselves
living with the consequences

00:44:58.195 --> 00:44:59.229
of those inequalities.

00:44:59.229 --> 00:45:00.253
(siren)

00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:11.967
Woman:
Thank you!

00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:15.345
Come on, girls.

00:45:15.345 --> 00:45:16.847
Narrator:
Those who suffer most

00:45:16.847 --> 00:45:18.849
from this systemic inequality

00:45:18.849 --> 00:45:23.353
are the one in four American
children born into poverty.

00:45:23.353 --> 00:45:25.322
Brrr. It's cold out, huh?

00:45:25.322 --> 00:45:26.490
Narrator:
Ashley's children,

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:29.118
Amelia and London,
are among them.

00:45:30.494 --> 00:45:31.895
Ashley:
I'm definitely struggling,

00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:33.097
but people tell me,

00:45:33.097 --> 00:45:36.828
"You're not poor, you're broke,
you're not poor."

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:40.738
Powell:
Because we're individualistic,

00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:41.839
when we see poor people,

00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:43.907
we're more likely to think,
"It's their fault."

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:47.711
Europe tends to think
if you're poor, it's bad luck

00:45:47.711 --> 00:45:49.213
and there's
a structural problem.

00:45:49.213 --> 00:45:51.248
The United States tends
to think if you're poor,

00:45:51.248 --> 00:45:52.079
it's your problem.

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:54.384
Narrator:
Ashley and her daughters

00:45:54.384 --> 00:46:01.225
live on $1,100amonth,
about $13,000 a year,

00:46:01.225 --> 00:46:03.460
well below the poverty line.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:06.296
This is the public assistance
Ashley relies on

00:46:06.296 --> 00:46:09.566
because she's unable
to work due to illness-

00:46:09.566 --> 00:46:11.735
and it's not enough.

00:46:11.735 --> 00:46:13.637
Ashley:
My food stamps last me

00:46:13.637 --> 00:46:15.873
about three weeks.

00:46:15.873 --> 00:46:19.042
I go through my house
and I sell what I can,

00:46:19.042 --> 00:46:23.247
anything that I can
do to get money.

00:46:23.247 --> 00:46:27.117
Everybody thinks that
you get state assistance,

00:46:27.117 --> 00:46:29.319
well, you're just lazy
and you don't want to work.

00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:32.122
That's not the case
for the majority

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:34.458
and that's sure not
the case forme.

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:36.160
Narrator:
Ashley became a single mother

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.926
and fell into poverty
when she left her husband.

00:46:41.098 --> 00:46:43.100
Ashley:
When Amelia was 3 months old,

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:46.470
he became physically
abusive towards me.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.572
Amelia, what's this one?

00:46:48.572 --> 00:46:49.640
No hitting.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.474
Yeah.

00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:52.075
Ashley:
Amelia was present

00:46:52.075 --> 00:46:55.443
during all of the assaults
and was right next tome.

00:46:56.013 --> 00:46:57.447
Amelia:
Stay with mommy!

00:46:57.447 --> 00:46:58.682
Stay with mommy.

00:46:58.682 --> 00:46:59.750
Narrator:
She was pregnant

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:02.586
with her second daughter,
London.

00:47:02.586 --> 00:47:03.987
Ashley:
While I was working,

00:47:03.987 --> 00:47:06.657
I ended up going
into pre-term labor

00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:08.792
because I had a large
uterine tear

00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:10.794
from him kicking me
down the stairs

00:47:10.794 --> 00:47:13.330
and kicking me
in the stomach.

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:17.134
And she made it,
but she was six weeks early

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:23.507
and during my over twelve-week
stint of being hospitalized,

00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:25.342
I did a Family Medical Leave,

00:47:25.342 --> 00:47:28.073
but those are only good
for 12 weeks.

00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:30.948
And then when that ended,

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:33.617
my job told me I had taken up
too much time

00:47:33.617 --> 00:47:35.485
and they just didn't
have use for me.

00:47:35.485 --> 00:47:37.855
And they let me go.

00:47:37.855 --> 00:47:41.525
So I was here with two children
and no job.

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:47.331
It's been one thing
after another, unfortunately.

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:49.629
Mom! Where's my
butterfly nightlight?

00:47:51.335 --> 00:47:52.598
Hey, I found it!

00:47:54.805 --> 00:47:56.907
Narrator:
The US child poverty rate

00:47:56.907 --> 00:48:02.539
ranks 34th among 35 nations,
with only Romania behind us.

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:06.717
(child cries)

00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:07.718
Ashley:
I'm running out

00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:09.152
of things to sell...

00:48:09.152 --> 00:48:12.356
I just worry how am
I going to pay my bills.

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:15.158
How am I gonna to
take care of everything

00:48:15.158 --> 00:48:16.493
that they need?

00:48:16.493 --> 00:48:23.033
If I'm stressed, when I'm
feeling upset or feeling down,

00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:26.403
they're really good, I think,
about sensing it.

00:48:26.403 --> 00:48:28.739
Because they'll come up
and they'll give me a hug

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:31.241
or my daughter London,

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:34.211
she'll come up and she'll
tell me she loves me.

00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:36.873
And I worry every day
if that's going to affect them.

00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:38.415
This one.

00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:39.449
Shonkoff:
There are many

00:48:39.449 --> 00:48:40.517
low-income families

00:48:40.517 --> 00:48:43.253
who do a magnificent job
raising their children.

00:48:43.253 --> 00:48:44.421
That's sharing, right?

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:45.789
London:
Sharing.

00:48:45.789 --> 00:48:47.557
Shonkoff:
It's the pile up-

00:48:47.557 --> 00:48:49.626
low education on top
of low income

00:48:49.626 --> 00:48:51.295
on top of exposure to violence -

00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:55.732
the cumulative burden
of all of those forces

00:48:55.732 --> 00:48:59.636
create a sense
of chronic crisis,

00:48:59.636 --> 00:49:02.139
chronic activation
of the stress system,

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:04.073
what we call toxic stress.

00:49:05.642 --> 00:49:07.244
Narrator:
The Wisconsin study found

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:10.414
that stress experienced
even by middle-class parents

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:11.748
can alter the architecture

00:49:11.748 --> 00:49:14.012
of their childrens1
developing brains.

00:49:14.584 --> 00:49:16.887
When parents are poor
and struggling,

00:49:16.887 --> 00:49:20.991
the stress and anxiety they
experience can be even greater.

00:49:20.991 --> 00:49:24.051
And so can the possible
impact on their children.

00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:26.630
Burgh y:
Why is mom upset?

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:28.598
Now why are mom
and dad yelling?

00:49:28.598 --> 00:49:31.168
have any food?

00:49:31.168 --> 00:49:33.737
You have all of these
things going on

00:49:33.737 --> 00:49:37.441
that you don't really have
anymore cognitive

00:49:37.441 --> 00:49:41.707
or physical energy to
deal with anything else.

00:49:42.346 --> 00:49:43.513
No...

00:49:43.513 --> 00:49:45.182
I can't find it!

00:49:45.182 --> 00:49:47.684
You'll find one.

00:49:47.684 --> 00:49:50.320
We all gotta Undone
eventually.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.855
Your turn, Mia.

00:49:51.855 --> 00:49:54.958
Ashley:
Amelia is so bright.

00:49:54.958 --> 00:50:00.931
She's just hilarious
and London is also so funny...

00:50:00.931 --> 00:50:02.799
and so adorable!

00:50:02.799 --> 00:50:07.304
But, but she is facing
her own struggles.

00:50:07.304 --> 00:50:10.000
She's dealing
with hypersensitivity.

00:50:10.974 --> 00:50:12.209
Stop!

00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:13.877
Amelia,
you're upsetting her.

00:50:13.877 --> 00:50:14.845
Ashley:
If you look at her

00:50:14.845 --> 00:50:17.280
the wrong way, she'll cry.

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.816
If you tell her to
wait a minute,

00:50:19.816 --> 00:50:23.353
hold on, one second, she'll

00:50:23.353 --> 00:50:24.788
Oh, so close!

00:50:24.788 --> 00:50:27.190
I told you I can't find it!

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:28.291
Narrator:
Children who have faced

00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:31.361
the uncertainty of poverty
and other adversities

00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:35.499
may often have
a hair-trigger stress response.

00:50:35.499 --> 00:50:39.736
Being constantly on alert makes
sense in a precarious world.

00:50:39.736 --> 00:50:41.338
But it has consequences.

00:50:41.338 --> 00:50:43.640
No, don't get mad.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.308
No. No, no, no.

00:50:45.308 --> 00:50:47.644
Boynton-Jarrett:
The adaptation of the individual

00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:52.249
is functional for dealing
with those adversities,

00:50:52.249 --> 00:50:56.753
but comes at the expense
of your ability

00:50:56.753 --> 00:51:01.691
to then engage in other things,
to learn productively

00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:05.162
in your environment,
to engage with others

00:51:05.162 --> 00:51:07.130
or form relationships.

00:51:08.165 --> 00:51:09.894
So it comes at a cost.

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:14.204
The biggest question is

00:51:14.204 --> 00:51:18.175
what do we do after a child
has faced an adversity

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:21.668
and what are we doing
to prevent future adversities.

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:23.713
Ashley:
I'd like to think

00:51:23.713 --> 00:51:25.615
they're doing really well.

00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:30.053
I worry every day that
I may not be enough for them.

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:35.592
I worry, are they happy?

00:51:35.592 --> 00:51:39.062
Do they feel enough love?

00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:43.066
I'm trying my best to give them
everything that I can.

00:51:43.066 --> 00:51:45.262
If I could give them more,
I would.

00:51:48.371 --> 00:51:49.566
It's hard.

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:54.711
Boynton-Jarrett:
The brain has the ability

00:51:54.711 --> 00:51:57.481
to continue to grow
and develop.

00:51:57.481 --> 00:52:01.118
It also has the ability to heal.

00:52:01.118 --> 00:52:06.156
If we can create a reliable,
structured social environment

00:52:06.156 --> 00:52:08.658
that is safe and secure,

00:52:08.658 --> 00:52:12.596
the capacity of the brain
and the human spirit

00:52:12.596 --> 00:52:15.565
to continue
and thrive and develop

00:52:15.565 --> 00:52:18.592
is beyond what any of us
could predict.

00:52:28.345 --> 00:52:29.412
Shonkoff:
What do we all want

00:52:29.412 --> 00:52:31.348
for our children?

00:52:31.348 --> 00:52:35.318
We want them to
be healthy and thriving.

00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:38.021
We want them to be growing
and learning

00:52:38.021 --> 00:52:40.490
and being all they can be.

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:42.259
My name starts with an "A."

00:52:42.259 --> 00:52:43.193
That's right!

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:44.861
We want them to be happy.

00:52:44.861 --> 00:52:47.297
(baby laughs)

00:52:47.297 --> 00:52:50.100
What could we be doing
to strengthen the capacity

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.202
of everyone who interacts
with children

00:52:52.202 --> 00:52:55.605
to be able to provide more
of what they need?

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:58.808
What could we do
to be smarter?

00:52:58.808 --> 00:53:01.778
Dugger:
Smart societies look ahead

00:53:01.778 --> 00:53:05.549
and if they see a cliff,
they turn the car

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:06.716
and drive this way.

00:53:06.716 --> 00:53:10.620
They don't need the accident
to teach them,

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.351
"need to turn the car,
need to change direction."

00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:18.161
We know we got a crisis,
but we're choosing to try

00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:21.565
to perpetuate the old way
of doing things.

00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:24.067
We've got to make
different choices.

00:53:24.067 --> 00:53:26.303
Shonkoff:
How can we strengthen families?

00:53:26.303 --> 00:53:27.537
Where's my other child?

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:28.738
there you are.

00:53:28.738 --> 00:53:37.147
How could we strengthen

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:39.316
What kind of role could
business play

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:41.151
to help support the family life

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:42.719
of the people
who work for them?

00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:44.821
There's a policy gap
in this country...

00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:46.389
Woman:
How many signatures

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:47.524
do you have?

00:53:47.524 --> 00:53:49.492
We've got more than
46,000 signatures...

00:53:49.492 --> 00:53:50.894
Shonkoff:
Instead of blaming

00:53:50.894 --> 00:53:51.928
government programs

00:53:51.928 --> 00:53:54.556
we ought to say,
"How could we do a better job?"

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.603
What do you want to
be when you grow up?

00:53:59.603 --> 00:54:00.604
A fireman!

00:54:00.604 --> 00:54:01.738
A fireman!

00:54:01.738 --> 00:54:06.343
So you want to help people?

00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:08.845
Boynton-Jarrett:
There is strong

00:54:08.845 --> 00:54:13.850
and overwhelming evidence that's
all saying the same thing.

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:18.755
Investing early in the lives
of all children

00:54:18.755 --> 00:54:22.025
is not only cost-effective
for the whole society,

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:26.223
but improves well-being
for all members of society.

00:54:27.697 --> 00:54:29.466
OK...

00:54:29.466 --> 00:54:31.067
We're making a house!

00:54:31.067 --> 00:54:33.436
Do you want to help us?

00:54:33.436 --> 00:54:34.704
powell:
If we worked out the problem

00:54:34.704 --> 00:54:37.307
of actually being inclusive
and fair for all children

00:54:37.307 --> 00:54:41.544
in terms of their productivity
as future workers

00:54:41.544 --> 00:54:43.046
and their productivity

00:54:43.046 --> 00:54:45.715
as future citizens
and members of society,

00:54:45.715 --> 00:54:48.218
America would explode
in terms of creativity,

00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:48.618
America would explode
in terms of creativity,

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:53.490
in terms of growth,
in terms of ingenuity.

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:58.189
If we play with a full deck,
this country would explode.

00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:09.906
Terry:
If you think about our future

00:55:09.906 --> 00:55:12.409
and what America's going
to look like,

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:14.707
this is the future right here.

00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:17.774
Invest in their parents.

00:55:19.182 --> 00:55:21.276
Invest in these children.

00:55:24.788 --> 00:55:26.221
(baby vocalizes)

00:55:29.259 --> 00:55:32.786
They're not going to fail you,
but we can't fail them now.

00:57:41.424 --> 00:57:43.126
