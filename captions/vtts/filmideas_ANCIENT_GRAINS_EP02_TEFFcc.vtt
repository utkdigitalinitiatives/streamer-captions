00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.417
- Grains are the gifts of
the ancient civilizations

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:39.125
to the modern world.

00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:41.125
They have become a part
of these civilizations'

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.959
enduring legacy.

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:45.834
Quinoa from the Incas,
amaranth from the Aztecs,

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:50.125
maize from the Mayans,
rice from the Chinese.

00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:54.625
While these grains
gained international
fame over the years,

00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:58.999
there is one that has
remained relatively unknown

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:01.999
to the world.

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:03.667
This grain is called teff,

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:05.875
the Ethiopians'
gift to the world.

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:09.125
Teff with scientific
name Eragrostis tef,
is an annual grass

00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:14.125
that originated in the
Ethiopian highlands

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:17.999
and was first domesticated
between 8,000 - 5,000 BC.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.999
Unlike the other grains,

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:25.999
accounts of teff's travel to
other countries are limited.

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:30.125
It is believed that in 1886,
the Royal Botanic Gardens

00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:34.667
in England obtained teff
seeds from Ethiopia,

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:37.625
which was then still
called abyssinia,

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:40.834
then distributed
them to its colonies,

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:42.999
India and Australia for
a trial cultivation.

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:46.834
Teff reached the United
States in the 1980's

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.125
when Wayne Carlson, a
public health worker,

00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:53.125
who worked in Ethiopia for some
time realized that Ethiopia

00:01:53.291 --> 00:01:57.125
and his hometown Idaho had
similar geology and climate

00:01:57.291 --> 00:02:01.834
and decided to import
and cultivate teff seeds.

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:05.667
His decision proved
to be fruitful,

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.000
since he now owns a large
teff company in Idaho

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:11.834
and is referred to as "the
father of American teff".

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:16.125
Teff can grow in a wide
range of soil types,

00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:19.125
elevations, and temperature.

00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:21.834
The only thing it cannot
tolerate is frost.

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:25.125
It grows up to one
meter in height

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:27.667
with long and narrow leaves.

00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:29.999
It has a compact
panigale inflorescence,

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.667
with grains as small as 1
to 1.5 millimeters long.

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:37.458
It's actually considered to
be the world's tiniest grain.

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:42.125
It can thrive in
drought-stressed soils,
water-logged soils,

00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:47.125
and as well as in
black cotton soils,

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:50.834
and in areas with
the rainfall range

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:52.875
of 300 - 2,500 millimeters.

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:56.917
Teff is not sensitive
to altitudes, either.

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.875
Majority of it is grown in areas

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:02.999
between 1,100 - 2,950
meters above sea level.

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:07.999
There are some cultivars

00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:11.208
that can thrive
beyond 3,000 meters.

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:15.458
It prefers temperatures as
high as 35 degrees celsius

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:19.667
and it cannot survive
prolonged frost.

00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:23.083
Teff is also commonly
used as a standby crop.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.999
Due to its short growing season,

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:29.834
some cultivars mature
between 45 and 60 days.

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:34.125
When there's a growth failure
among main crops like maize,

00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:38.125
farmers rely on teff as
an alternative food source

00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:41.834
especially during
calamities and disasters.

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.999
This makes teff an ideal
crop to fight famine.

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:49.999
Teff varieties are typically
identified through colors,

00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:54.458
white, red, and brown.

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:57.125
White teff is the
most in demand variety

00:03:57.291 --> 00:04:00.208
and is mainly
exported by Ethiopia.

00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:03.125
It is expensive because
its planting requires

00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:06.458
more attention.

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:08.125
The red and brown varieties
are easier to grow

00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:11.125
compared to the white variety,
so it's not as expensive.

00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:15.875
It matures easily, that's
why it is typically used

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:19.125
as a fodder crop
in South Africa.

00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:23.125
But because of its
high iron content,

00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:25.667
human consumption rate
is slowly increasing.

00:04:25.834 --> 00:04:29.125
Even though there is a
prevailing export ban

00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:31.999
of unprocessed
grain in Ethiopia,

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:34.667
making it the major producer
of teff in the world,

00:04:34.834 --> 00:04:37.458
there are, however,
established teff productions

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:40.000
and industries in countries
like Australia, India, Canada,

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:44.999
and Idaho in the United States.

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:48.166
If national and international
policies would be formulated

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:52.458
for the advancement of teff,
it can also be grown in Mexico,

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:56.667
Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador,
Pakistan, and Nepal.

00:04:56.834 --> 00:05:01.667
This may prove beneficial
to the growing Ethiopian

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:04.999
population across the globe.

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:07.999
Teff may not be a significant
grain crop in the world.

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:19.458
Well, not yet.

00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:21.875
Its nutritional
profile may just prove

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:23.999
to be competitive enough
to propel this grain

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:27.125
to the ranks of maize,
wheat, and rice.

00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:30.834
Ethiopians are known sportsmen,
excelling specifically

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:34.834
in middle and long
distance track events.

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:37.458
With teff contributing
about two-thirds of protein

00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:40.667
in a typical Ethiopian diet,

00:05:40.834 --> 00:05:42.834
many nutritionists and
scientists are curious as to how

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:46.834
teff's nutritional properties
affect Ethiopians' physique.

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:51.667
One standout quality
of teff is its size.

00:05:51.834 --> 00:05:55.458
Because teff grains are
so tiny, refining them,

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:58.999
that is removing the bran
and germ is difficult.

00:05:59.083 --> 00:06:02.999
So teff is almost always
milled as a whole grain flour

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:06.999
with its nutrients, minerals,
and vitamins intact.

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:11.166
Here is what 100 grams
of cooked teff can offer.

00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:14.834
It has 101 kilocalories of
energy, 3.87 grams of protein,

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:19.834
19.86 grams of carbohydrates,
2.8 grams of fiber.

00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:26.125
Aside from the usual
soluble and insoluble fiber

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:30.458
that prevents constipation,

00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:32.667
20-40 % of teff's carbohydrates

00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:35.667
are considered
resistant starches.

00:06:35.834 --> 00:06:38.834
Resistant starches are
another type of fiber

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:41.834
that escapes digestion and
remains in the intestine.

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:45.999
It delays the secretion
of glucose in the blood,

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:49.125
making it beneficial
to diabetics

00:06:49.291 --> 00:06:51.667
in managing their
blood sugar levels.

00:06:51.834 --> 00:06:56.458
Also, resistant starch
can curb appetite,

00:06:56.625 --> 00:07:00.125
act as a natural laxative,
produce good bacteria,

00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:04.041
and maintain conducive pH
levels in the intestine

00:07:04.208 --> 00:07:07.999
for a healthier and
cleaner digestive system.

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:12.375
Teff also has competitive
mineral and vitamin content.

00:07:13.458 --> 00:07:17.458
It has 49 milligrams of
Calcium, 2 milligrams of Iron,

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:22.458
50 milligrams of Magnesium,
120 milligrams of Phosphorous,

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:27.875
107 milligrams of Potassium,
8 milligrams of Sodium,

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:33.458
1.11 milligrams of Zinc,
2.86 milligrams of Manganese,

00:07:33.834 --> 00:07:38.667
and 0.23 milligrams of Copper.

00:07:40.166 --> 00:07:43.917
It has .183
milligrams of Thiamin,

00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:48.999
.033 milligrams of Riboflavin,

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:52.125
.91 milligrams of Niacin,
.097 milligrams of Vitamin B6,

00:07:52.291 --> 00:07:57.125
18 micrograms of Folate
and 2 IUs of Vitamin A.

00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:04.125
It's a known fact that
phosphorous and calcium

00:08:05.291 --> 00:08:08.125
have bone-friendly properties,
but they also promote

00:08:08.291 --> 00:08:11.667
healthy nerve and
muscle performance.

00:08:11.834 --> 00:08:14.458
Balanced levels
of these minerals

00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:16.458
regulate proper muscle
contraction including the heart.

00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:20.250
Phosphorous helps in
soothing sore muscles

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:23.083
after strenuous work or exercise
and is vital in the growth,

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.458
maintenance, and repair
of tissues in cells.

00:08:27.625 --> 00:08:30.750
Diabetes can cause phosphorous
in the body to deplete

00:08:30.917 --> 00:08:34.125
and can lead to poor bone,
muscle, and nerve functions.

00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:39.125
But since teff has a
low glycemic index,

00:08:40.999 --> 00:08:43.999
diabetics can have
enough amounts of
phosphorous in the body

00:08:43.999 --> 00:08:47.959
without fear of
increased insulin levels.

00:08:47.999 --> 00:08:51.999
Teff's potassium and sodium
help maintain fluid balance

00:08:52.875 --> 00:08:56.999
as well as pH levels
within one system.

00:08:56.999 --> 00:09:00.959
During metabolism,

00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:03.083
various acids are produced
and secreted in the body.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.999
When pH levels are disturbed,
alkaline-based compounds

00:09:06.999 --> 00:09:11.125
are released by the
body, specifically
calcium by the bones

00:09:11.291 --> 00:09:15.125
to neutralize the acid.

00:09:15.291 --> 00:09:17.458
Presence of potassium
neutralizes the acid

00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:20.667
before the bones are prompted
to release alkaline compounds,

00:09:20.834 --> 00:09:24.667
thus preventing
rapid calcium loss.

00:09:24.834 --> 00:09:28.625
Teff also has an impressive
amino acid profile.

00:09:28.792 --> 00:09:33.125
It has lysine which is typically
deficient in other grains.

00:09:33.291 --> 00:09:37.834
Roles of these
amino acids include

00:09:37.999 --> 00:09:40.458
maintenance of healthy
tissues and muscles,

00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:43.667
enhancement of the immune system

00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:45.625
and antioxidant activity and
production of neurotransmitters

00:09:45.792 --> 00:09:49.999
for optimal brain and
cognitive functions.

00:09:49.999 --> 00:09:54.375
Whether or not teff
is largely responsible

00:09:56.667 --> 00:09:59.125
for the Ethiopians' good
build, one thing is for sure.

00:09:59.291 --> 00:10:03.667
It deserves global recognition

00:10:03.834 --> 00:10:05.667
for its promising
nutritional values.

00:10:05.834 --> 00:10:09.750
Teff is Ethiopia's
most important crop.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.999
Since this grain is almost
exclusive to this country,

00:10:21.999 --> 00:10:26.041
it is deeply involved
in the Ethiopians'

00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:28.999
traditions and customs.

00:10:28.999 --> 00:10:31.999
The upper and lower
classes were differentiated

00:10:37.917 --> 00:10:40.375
by the variety of teff they ate.

00:10:40.542 --> 00:10:44.291
The rich consumed white teff,

00:10:50.792 --> 00:10:55.625
while soldiers and servants
ate the darker grains,

00:10:55.917 --> 00:10:58.834
red, brown, and black.

00:10:58.999 --> 00:11:02.500
The Ethiopians have
a traditional spongy
sourdough flatbread

00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:09.417
called injera or enjera
primarily made from teff flour.

00:11:09.583 --> 00:11:14.417
Variance of this bread
are eaten in Somalia,

00:11:15.417 --> 00:11:18.250
where it is called canjeero,

00:11:18.417 --> 00:11:21.999
and in Yemen where it is
popularly called lahoh.

00:11:21.999 --> 00:11:26.834
During the fasting days of
Ethiopian orthodox Tewahedo

00:11:33.041 --> 00:11:36.667
Christians, eating meat and
dairy products is prohibited.

00:11:36.834 --> 00:11:41.667
People heavily rely on injera

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.999
combined with fruits and
vegetables for sustenance

00:11:51.041 --> 00:11:54.625
during the holy days of fasting.

00:11:54.792 --> 00:11:57.999
Injera may be a bread,

00:12:03.417 --> 00:12:05.208
but it is always eaten
with sauces and stews

00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:08.458
such as alecha
and the spicy wat.

00:12:08.625 --> 00:12:13.458
Ethiopians do not use
utensils to eat ingera.

00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:19.667
As a matter of fact,

00:12:19.834 --> 00:12:20.999
this bread doubles as
cutlery during meals.

00:12:20.999 --> 00:12:25.417
The sauces and stews are
served on top of injera,

00:12:26.999 --> 00:12:30.999
making it look like
a platter of stews.

00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:34.709
Then using the right hand,

00:12:35.375 --> 00:12:36.999
Ethiopians tear a
piece of the bread

00:12:36.999 --> 00:12:39.458
and use it to scoop up the
stew or wrap pieces of bread

00:12:39.625 --> 00:12:43.041
before putting it
in their mouths.

00:12:43.208 --> 00:12:46.999
Injera is also an integral
piece in a uniquely Ethiopian

00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:54.500
eating ceremony called Gursha,

00:12:54.667 --> 00:12:57.250
which involves a
person feeding another.

00:12:57.417 --> 00:13:00.291
The ceremony is
carried out by a person

00:13:00.458 --> 00:13:02.875
tearing a piece of ingera,
wrapping meat in it

00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:06.250
and gently putting it
in the mouth of another.

00:13:06.417 --> 00:13:09.625
People accustomed to
eating with utensils

00:13:09.792 --> 00:13:12.125
and from individual plates,

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:13.999
will initially find
this practice a bit
of a culture shock.

00:13:13.999 --> 00:13:18.999
For the Ethiopians and
some people of east Africa,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.667
Gursha is an intimate act
of friendship and love,

00:13:22.834 --> 00:13:26.208
believing that those who
eat from the same plate

00:13:26.375 --> 00:13:29.208
will not betray each other.

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:32.458
The more people
involved in the Gursha,

00:13:38.375 --> 00:13:40.875
the stronger the
bond they create.

00:13:40.999 --> 00:13:44.208
Washington D.C. has the
largest Ethiopian community

00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:50.250
in the United States and to
preserve the taste of home,

00:13:50.417 --> 00:13:54.125
many Ethiopians ventured
into entrepreneurship

00:13:54.291 --> 00:13:57.458
and opened restaurants offering
authentic Ethiopian dishes

00:13:57.625 --> 00:14:01.999
including the injera bread.

00:14:02.083 --> 00:14:05.542
People, especially vegetarians,

00:14:08.667 --> 00:14:11.041
eventually embrace injera
as part of their diet,

00:14:11.208 --> 00:14:16.041
thus creating a steady
increase in demand for teff.

00:14:16.291 --> 00:14:20.792
This improved demand for the
grain has opened opportunities

00:14:23.917 --> 00:14:27.999
for farmers and
agriculturalists in other places

00:14:27.999 --> 00:14:31.208
like Nevada and Kansas.

00:14:31.375 --> 00:14:34.875
Teff may still be
relatively unknown,

00:14:43.458 --> 00:14:46.667
but modern technology can
definitely work to its advantage

00:14:46.834 --> 00:14:51.041
and promote not just
its nutritional values,

00:14:51.208 --> 00:14:55.250
but the Ethiopian
culture as well.

00:14:55.417 --> 00:14:58.999
In Ethiopia, teff may be
widely used as a cereal,

00:15:27.999 --> 00:15:32.250
but in other countries it
is used as a forage crop

00:15:32.417 --> 00:15:35.999
due to its short
maturity period,

00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:38.208
undemanding planting
requirements,

00:15:38.375 --> 00:15:40.458
and of course high
nutritional value.

00:15:40.625 --> 00:15:44.208
However, teff's use
as a human food source

00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:51.417
is now gradually
expanding from Ethiopia

00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:54.999
to places like the United
States and South Africa.

00:15:54.999 --> 00:15:59.999
As a matter of fact,

00:16:02.625 --> 00:16:04.041
in 1996 the U.S.
National Research Council

00:16:04.208 --> 00:16:08.000
had recognized teff's
potential to improve nutrition,

00:16:08.166 --> 00:16:12.250
boost food security and
promote rural development.

00:16:12.417 --> 00:16:17.125
Ethiopia is the largest
producer of teff in the world,

00:16:19.709 --> 00:16:23.625
but its average
yield is still low,

00:16:23.792 --> 00:16:25.999
compared to other grains
cultivated in the country.

00:16:25.999 --> 00:16:29.458
Due to this low supply, it
failed to meet the demand,

00:16:29.625 --> 00:16:33.250
resulting in high
prices from 2007- 2008.

00:16:33.417 --> 00:16:38.250
The Ethiopian
government was alarmed

00:16:41.917 --> 00:16:44.041
that normal households couldn't
afford this basic commodity

00:16:44.208 --> 00:16:47.999
and had to switch
to other cereals.

00:16:47.999 --> 00:16:51.458
In 2006 former Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi

00:16:56.959 --> 00:17:00.999
imposed an export ban on
raw, unprocessed teff grains

00:17:00.999 --> 00:17:05.208
in hopes of addressing
the increasing price,

00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:08.083
as well as focus
on teff production

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.250
for the country's food security.

00:17:10.417 --> 00:17:12.417
The ban is still in effect.

00:17:12.583 --> 00:17:15.583
In 2010, the
Ethiopian Agriculture
Transformation Agency

00:17:20.333 --> 00:17:25.083
or ATA was established to
focus on the improvement

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.999
of teff production
and cultivation.

00:17:28.999 --> 00:17:31.999
During a national
workshop in January 2012,

00:17:31.999 --> 00:17:35.667
the ATA identified
some key obstacles

00:17:35.834 --> 00:17:38.999
hindering improved
teff production.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.999
Poor distribution of
improved seed varieties,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.667
agronomic practices like row
planting are not applied,

00:17:45.834 --> 00:17:49.999
poor soil management,

00:17:49.999 --> 00:17:52.083
a shortage of post-harvest
processing technologies,

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:56.999
a lack of proper storage system

00:17:58.709 --> 00:18:00.999
and a lack of farmer's
access to various markets.

00:18:01.083 --> 00:18:05.959
The ATA has already
implemented projects

00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:10.083
to address these concerns,
one of which is conducting

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.250
hands-on productivity
enhancement demonstrations

00:18:14.417 --> 00:18:17.417
among small holder farms

00:18:17.583 --> 00:18:19.667
to teach more efficient and
effective farming techniques

00:18:19.834 --> 00:18:23.041
such as seedling transplanting
and row planting,

00:18:23.208 --> 00:18:26.875
instead of the traditional
method of broadcasting.

00:18:26.999 --> 00:18:30.667
The ATA is also focusing
on improving productivity

00:18:37.208 --> 00:18:40.999
by harnessing modern and
mechanized farming tools

00:18:40.999 --> 00:18:44.250
such as the row
planters, the hoe weeder,

00:18:44.417 --> 00:18:47.500
the hoe weeder hand tool
to minimize time consumed

00:18:47.667 --> 00:18:50.625
in weeding and the
multi-crop thresher

00:18:50.792 --> 00:18:53.250
to reduce post-harvest losses.

00:18:53.417 --> 00:18:56.750
Technical experts,
development agents,

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.667
and production manuals were
deployed and distributed

00:19:05.834 --> 00:19:08.999
to various teff-growing areas,

00:19:08.999 --> 00:19:11.250
to facilitate and reinforce
the ATA's efforts.

00:19:11.417 --> 00:19:15.999
Though Ethiopia's teff
export policy allows

00:19:20.875 --> 00:19:23.999
for the export of
processed teff like flour,

00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:27.250
many people believe that
lifting the export ban

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:29.999
on raw teff grains can
benefit the country greatly.

00:19:29.999 --> 00:19:33.999
Since demand for
teff is increasing,

00:19:33.999 --> 00:19:36.625
income from international trade

00:19:36.792 --> 00:19:38.792
and the export of raw
teff grains can contribute

00:19:38.959 --> 00:19:41.999
to the country's gross
domestic product or GDP

00:19:41.999 --> 00:19:45.625
and to Ethiopia's overall growth
and transformation plants.

00:19:45.792 --> 00:19:50.625
Lifting the export ban can
also introduce the small teff

00:19:52.667 --> 00:19:55.999
market to more modern
interventions, which can further

00:19:56.083 --> 00:19:59.999
improve productivity
to secure food security

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:03.500
not just in Ethiopia
but in the whole world.

00:20:03.667 --> 00:20:07.999
Teff may be a 100%
Ethiopian grain,

00:20:19.792 --> 00:20:22.875
but that does not mean
that different cultures

00:20:22.999 --> 00:20:25.667
should not get the opportunity
to enjoy this grain's mixture

00:20:25.834 --> 00:20:29.250
of mild, nutty,
and sweet flavors.

00:20:29.417 --> 00:20:33.417
Teff's texture varies depending

00:20:35.417 --> 00:20:37.000
on the method
applied in cooking.

00:20:37.166 --> 00:20:39.625
For a poppyseed-like texture,
perfect for salads and stews,

00:20:39.792 --> 00:20:44.041
cook 1 cup of teff in 1 cup
of water for 6-7 minutes

00:20:44.208 --> 00:20:48.999
and let it stand covered for
5 minutes more before serving.

00:20:48.999 --> 00:20:53.999
For a creamier
texture like porridge,

00:20:55.999 --> 00:20:58.417
cook 1 cup of teff in 3 cups
of water for 20 minutes.

00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:03.417
Here's a recipe using
teff flour called

00:21:03.667 --> 00:21:06.875
Teff Crepe with
Spinach and Mushroom.

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:09.625
For the crepe, you will
need 1/2 cup of teff flour,

00:21:09.792 --> 00:21:14.041
1/2 teaspoon of salt,
1/2 cup of whole milk,

00:21:14.208 --> 00:21:18.250
1 large egg and 1
tablespoon of melted butter.

00:21:18.417 --> 00:21:22.166
For the filling,

00:21:22.333 --> 00:21:23.750
you will need 1 tablespoon
of extra virgin olive oil,

00:21:23.917 --> 00:21:26.999
227 grams of sliced mushrooms,
6 cups of fresh baby spinach,

00:21:26.999 --> 00:21:31.999
salt, freshly ground black
pepper and parmesan cheese.

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:38.291
First, make the filling.

00:21:38.999 --> 00:21:40.834
Heat oil in a large
nonstick skillet or pan

00:21:40.999 --> 00:21:43.999
over medium-high heat.

00:21:43.999 --> 00:21:46.250
Sauté mushrooms for 5 minutes,
then add spinach, salt,

00:21:46.417 --> 00:21:50.667
and pepper and cook
for another minute.

00:21:50.834 --> 00:21:53.458
Remove from the pan.

00:21:53.625 --> 00:21:55.834
Second, prepare the crepes.

00:21:55.999 --> 00:21:58.667
In a medium bowl, combine
teff flour and salt.

00:21:58.834 --> 00:22:02.250
Then whisk the milk, egg, and
melted butter in another bowl.

00:22:02.417 --> 00:22:06.999
Add the milk
mixture to the flour

00:22:06.999 --> 00:22:08.999
and whisk until
it becomes smooth.

00:22:09.125 --> 00:22:12.834
Using the same skillet or pan,

00:22:12.999 --> 00:22:15.250
pour a quarter cup
of the crepe batter

00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:18.834
and tilt it in a circular motion

00:22:18.999 --> 00:22:20.709
to spread the batter
thinly and evenly.

00:22:20.875 --> 00:22:23.999
Cook for 45 seconds.

00:22:23.999 --> 00:22:26.999
Then use a spatula to flip over

00:22:26.999 --> 00:22:29.542
and cook the other side
another 30 seconds.

00:22:29.709 --> 00:22:33.208
Repeat the same process until
all the batter is used up.

00:22:33.375 --> 00:22:37.959
Third, divide the
filling among the crepes.

00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:43.250
Roll them and sprinkle
parmesan cheese before serving.

00:22:43.417 --> 00:22:47.625
Teff flour is popularly
used in making injera.

00:22:47.792 --> 00:22:51.625
The traditional way
of making injera,

00:22:51.792 --> 00:22:53.999
usually takes 3-5 days due
to the fermentation process.

00:22:53.999 --> 00:22:58.208
Here is an injera recipe you
can finish in 1 1/2 days.

00:22:58.375 --> 00:23:02.250
Prepare the following, 1
1/2 cups of teff flour,

00:23:02.417 --> 00:23:07.250
2 cups of water, 1/2
teaspoon of baking powder,

00:23:07.417 --> 00:23:12.250
oil for the pan, 1/4
teaspoon of salt.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.667
First, ferment the
teff flour this way.

00:23:16.834 --> 00:23:19.625
Put the flour and
water in a large bowl.

00:23:19.792 --> 00:23:22.625
Stir well, cover with a towel,

00:23:22.792 --> 00:23:25.250
place somewhere where
it will not be disturbed

00:23:25.417 --> 00:23:27.834
and let it sit for 24 hours.

00:23:27.999 --> 00:23:30.834
After 24 hours, stir in
the salt and baking powder.

00:23:30.999 --> 00:23:35.041
The mixture will deflate
once you stir it.

00:23:35.208 --> 00:23:38.208
Now, it's time to cook.

00:23:38.375 --> 00:23:40.999
Heat and oil pan
over medium-heat.

00:23:41.083 --> 00:23:43.834
Pour the batter into the pan,

00:23:43.999 --> 00:23:45.458
enough to fill the surface
and cover with a lid.

00:23:45.625 --> 00:23:49.250
Keeping the moisture
is important

00:23:49.417 --> 00:23:51.250
to prevent the
injera from cracking.

00:23:51.417 --> 00:23:54.834
Cook for 5-7 minutes or
until the top becomes dry

00:23:54.999 --> 00:23:58.667
and the edges begin to curl.

00:23:58.834 --> 00:24:00.667
Remove from pan and
repeat the process

00:24:00.834 --> 00:24:02.999
until all the batter is used up.

00:24:02.999 --> 00:24:05.999
It is clear that teff has
more potential beyond injera

00:24:06.709 --> 00:24:10.999
and as a awareness for this
grain continues to rise,

00:24:10.999 --> 00:24:14.625
it will not be surprising
if the world gets to enjoy

00:24:14.792 --> 00:24:18.250
new and exciting teff-based
meals some time in the future.
