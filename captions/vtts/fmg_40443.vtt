WEBVTT

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.660
OUR EARTH IS THE ONLY KNOWN
PLANET THAT SUSTAINS LIFE...

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.760
AND IT DOES SO
IN ABUNDANCE.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.930
I HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE
ENOUGH OVER THE YEARS

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.760
TO TRAVEL TO SOME OF
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.200
AND REMOTE PLACES ON EARTH
TO FIND AND FILM ANIMALS.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.500
THIS IS THE BIGGEST
FLOWER IN THE WORLD.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.430
THE BLUE WHALE!

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.800
IT'S THE BIGGEST CREATURE
THAT EXISTS ON THE PLANET.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.160
THE SHEER NUMBER AND
VARIETY OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.430
IS ASTONISHING.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.130
ESTIMATES OF THE NUMBER
OF DIFFERENT SPECIES

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.030
VARY FROM SIX MILLION
TO 100 MILLION.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.860
NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY
HOW MANY DIFFERENT KINDS

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.730
OF ANIMALS
THERE ARE HERE.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.160
WHEREVER YOU
LOOK THERE'S LIFE.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.460
THERE ARE OFTEN A MULTITUDE OF
VARIATIONS ON A SINGLE PATTERN.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.630
NEARLY 200 DIFFERENT KINDS
OF MONKEYS, FOR EXAMPLE.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.800
AND 315 HUMMINGBIRDS.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:27.460
NEARLY A THOUSAND BATS.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.630
AND BEETLES - AT LEAST
350,000 SPECIES OF THEM.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.530
NOT TO MENTION A QUARTER
OF A MILLION DIFFERENT KINDS

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.060
OF FLOWERING PLANTS.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.860
THE VARIETY IS ASTOUNDING.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.860
EVEN IN THIS ONE SMALL ENGLISH
WOODLAND YOU MIGHT SEE

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.860
FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT
KINDS OF FINCHES.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.460
WHY SHOULD THERE BE
SUCH A DAZZLING VARIETY?

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.260
AND HOW CAN WE MAKE
SENSE OF SUCH A HUGE RANGE

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.760
OF LIVING ORGANISMS?

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.630
TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO, A
MAN WAS BORN WHO WAS TO

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.230
EXPLAIN THIS ASTONISHING
DIVERSITY OF LIFE.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.330
IN DOING SO, HE
REVOLUTIONIZED THE WAY

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.630
IN WHICH WE SEE THE
WORLD AND OUR PLACE IN IT.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.400
HIS NAME WAS
CHARLES DARWIN.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.730
THIS BOOK, THE HOLY
BIBLE, EXPLAINS HOW

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.730
THIS WONDERFUL
DIVERSITY CAME ABOUT.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.560
ON THE THIRD DAY, AFTER
THE CREATION OF THE WORLD,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.830
GOD CREATED PLANTS.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.260
ON THE FIFTH DAY
FISH AND BIRDS,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.060
AND THEN ON THE SIXTH DAY
MAMMALS, AND FINALLY MAN.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.560
THAT EXPLANATION WAS BELIEVED
LITERALLY BY PRETTY WELL THE

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.630
WHOLE OF WESTERN EUROPE FOR
THE BEST PART OF 2,000 YEARS.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.230
AND GENERATIONS OF PAINTERS
PICTURED IT FOR THE FAITHFUL.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:44.160
THIS VERSION WAS PAINTED
IN ITALY IN THE 16TH CENTURY.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.800
HERE IS GOD IN THE GARDEN OF
EDEN WHICH IS NOW FILLED WITH

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.560
ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.930
HERE HE IS PULLING
ADAM OUT OF THE EARTH.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.660
AND HERE CREATING THE FIRST
WOMAN BY PUTTING ADAM TO SLEEP

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.660
AND THEN TAKING
ONE OF HIS RIBS

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.300
AND EXTRACTING
EVE FROM HIS SIDE.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.360
AND SHE COMES OUT
ASSISTED BY TWO ANGELS.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.530
AND WHEN GOD HAD FINISHED
HE SAID TO ADAM AND EVE

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.930
"BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY
AND REPLENISH THE EARTH

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.730
AND SUBDUE IT AND HAVE DOMINION
OVER THE FISH OF THE SEA

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.560
AND OVER THE FOWL OF THE AIR
AND OVER EVERY LIVING THING

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.930
THAT MOVETH
UPON THE EARTH".

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.230
THAT MADE IT CLEAR, THAT
ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE,

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.560
HUMANITY COULD EXPLOIT THE
NATURAL WORLD AS THEY WISHED.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.630
THIS VIEW OF MANKIND'S
SUPERIORITY STILL STOOD

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.800
WHEN IN 1881 A BRITISH
SURVEYING SHIP, THE BEAGLE,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.860
SET OFF ON A VOYAGE
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.500
ON BOARD, AS A
COMPANION TO THE CAPTAIN,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.430
WAS THE 22-YEAR-OLD
CHARLES DARWIN.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.130
THEY CROSSED THE ATLANTIC
AND MADE LANDFALL

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.460
ON THE COAST
OF BRAZIL.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.460
THERE THE SHEER ABUNDANCE
OF TROPICAL NATURE

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.430
ASTONISHES THE NEWCOMER
AS I DISCOVERED WHEN I

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.660
RETRACED DARWIN'S STEPS
30 YEARS AGO FOR A

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.460
TELEVISION SERIES ABOUT
THE DIVERSITY OF NATURE.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.630
DARWIN AS A BOY HAD BEEN A
FANATICAL COLLECTOR OF INSECTS,

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.930
AND HERE HE WAS ENTHRALLED
ALMOST TO THE POINT OF ECSTASY.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.900
IN ONE DAY IN A SMALL AREA
HE DISCOVERED 69 DIFFERENT

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.930
SPECIES OF BEETLE.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.260
AS HE WROTE IN HIS JOURNAL,
"IT'S ENOUGH TO DISTURB THE

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.230
COMPOSURE OF THE
ENTOMOLOGIST'S MIND

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.960
TO CONTEMPLATE THE
FUTURE DIMENSION

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.700
OF A COMPLETE
CATALOG".

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.230
THEY WENT SOUTH,
ROUNDED CAPE HORN,

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.330
AND SO REACHED
THE PACIFIC.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.330
AND THEN, IN SEPTEMBER 1835,
AFTER THEY'D BEEN AWAY FOR

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.430
ALMOST FOUR YEARS, THEY LANDED
ON THE LITTLE KNOWN ISLANDS

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.330
OF THE GALAPAGOS.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.130
HERE THEY FOUND CREATURES
THAT EXISTED NOWHERE ELSE

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.560
IN THE WORLD.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.160
CORMORANTS THAT HAD
LOST THE POWER TO FLIGHT.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.730
LIZARDS THAT SWAM
OUT THROUGH THE SURF

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.630
TO GRAZE ON THE
BOTTOM OF THE SEA.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.500
THE BRITISH RESIDENT IN THE
GALAPAGOS CLAIMED THAT

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.530
HE KNEW FROM THE SHAPE
OF A GIANT TORTOISE'S SHELL

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.500
WHICH ISLAND IT
HAD COME FROM.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.200
IF IT HAD A ROUNDED FRONT IT
CAME FROM A WELL-WATERED ISLAND

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.660
WHERE IT FED ON
LUSH GROUND PLANTS.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.460
WHEREAS ONE FROM A DRY
ISLAND HAD A PEAK AT THE FRONT

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.060
WHICH ENABLED IT TO REACH
UP TO HIGHER VEGETATION.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.630
WERE THESE TORTOISES EACH
ON THEIR SEPARATE ISLANDS

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.660
DIFFERENT SPECIES?

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.660
AND IF SO, WAS EACH
ONE A SEPARATE ACT

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.030
OF DIVINE CREATION?

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.500
THE DIFFERENCES THAT DARWIN
HAD NOTICED AMONGST THESE

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.630
GALAPAGOS ANIMALS WERE,
OF COURSE, ALL TINY.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.100
BUT IF THEY COULD DEVELOP,
WASN'T IT POSSIBLE THAT OVER THE

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.100
THOUSANDS OR MILLIONS OF YEARS A
WHOLE SERIES OF SUCH DIFFERENCES

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.800
MIGHT ADD UP TO ONE
REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE?

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:39.660
ON HIS VOYAGE HOME DARWIN HAD
TIME TO PONDER ON THESE THINGS.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.500
COULD IT BE THAT SPECIES
WERE NOT FIXED FOR ALL TIME,

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.730
BUT COULD IN FACT
SLOWLY CHANGE?

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.060
ON HIS RETURN HE
SORTED OUT HIS SPECIMENS

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.700
AND SENT THEM OFF
TO RELEVANT EXPERTS

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:05.500
SO THAT EACH COULD BE
IDENTIFIED AND CLASSIFIED.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:11.700
MOST OF THE MAMMAL BONES AND
FOSSILS HE SENT TO RICHARD OWEN.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.000
OWEN WAS ONE OF THE
MOST BRILLIANT ZOOLOGISTS

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.800
OF HIS TIME.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.300
HE WAS THE FIRST TO
RECOGNIZE DINOSAURS

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.960
AND INDEED HAD INVENTED
THEIR VERY NAME.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.260
AND HE WOULD LATER BECOME
THE CREATOR AND FIRST DIRECTOR

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:30.260
OF THE NATURAL HISTORY
MUSEUM IN LONDON.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:35.460
MANY OF THE SPECIMENS THAT
DARWIN COLLECTED ARE STILL

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.730
PRESERVED AND TREASURED HERE
AMONG THE 17 MILLION OTHER

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:47.100
SPECIMENS HOUSED IN THE
MUSEUM THAT OWEN FOUNDED.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:52.130
AND HERE IS
ONE OF THEM...

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.760
IT'S OBVIOUSLY THE LOWER
JAW OF SOME GREAT ANIMAL,

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.430
AND WHEN DARWIN DISCOVERED
IT, IT HAD BITS OF SKIN

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.130
AND HAIR ATTACHED TO IT
SO AT FIRST IT WAS THOUGHT

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.060
THEY WERE THE REMAINS
OF SOME LIVING SPECIES.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.600
BUT NOW WE KNOW THAT IT IS
A SPECIES THAT WAS EXTINCT

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.560
FOR SOME 10,000 YEARS:
A GIANT GROUND SLOTH.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.830
OWEN EXAMINED IT IN GREAT DETAIL
AND EVENTUALLY DESCRIBED IT

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:23.300
AND GAVE IT THE NAME
OF MYLODON DARWINII

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.700
IN HONOR OF
ITS DISCOVERER.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.730
BUT THAT MUTUAL RESPECT BETWEEN
TWO GREAT MEN OF SCIENCE

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.460
WAS NOT TO LAST.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.700
SOON AFTER HIS RETURN FROM HIS
VOYAGE DARWIN MADE HIS HOME

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.430
HERE IN DOWN
HOUSE IN KENT.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:47.830
HERE HE WROTE AN ACCOUNT OF HIS
TRAVELS AND WORKED ON DETAILED

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.130
SCIENTIFIC TREATISES ABOUT
CORALS AND BARNACLES

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:56.560
AND THE GEOLOGY AND
FOSSILS OF SOUTH AMERICA.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.430
BUT HE ALSO PONDERED
DEEPLY ON WHAT HE HAD SEEN

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.160
IN THE GALAPAGOS
AND ELSEWHERE.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.360
MAYBE SPECIES
WERE NOT FIXED...

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.460
EVERY DAY HE TOOK A WALK
IN THIS SMALL SPINNEY

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.730
THAT HE HAD PLANTED AT
THE END OF HIS GARDEN.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.900
AND IT WAS HERE THAT HE CAME
TO PONDER ON THE PROBLEMS

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.530
OF NATURAL HISTORY INCLUDING
THAT MYSTERY OF MYSTERIES:

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:47.860
HOW COULD ONE SPECIES
TURN INTO ANOTHER?

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:53.330
HE NOTED THAT MOST IF NOT ALL
ANIMALS PRODUCE MANY MORE YOUNG

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.000
THAN LIVE TO
BREED THEMSELVES.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.760
THIS FEMALE BLUE TIT,
FOR EXAMPLE, MAY WELL LAY

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.060
A DOZEN EGGS A YEAR, PERHAPS
50 OR SO IN HER LIFETIME,

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.800
YET ONLY TWO OF HER CHICKS NEED
TO SURVIVE AND BREED THEMSELVES

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.830
TO MAINTAIN THE NUMBERS
OF THE BLUE TIT POPULATION.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.430
THOSE SURVIVORS, OF COURSE,
ARE LIKELY TO BE THE HEALTHIEST

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.800
AND BEST SUITED TO THEIR
PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.060
THEIR CHARACTERISTICS
ARE THEN INHERITED.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.030
SO PERHAPS OVER MANY GENERATIONS
AND PARTICULARLY IF THERE ARE

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:31.260
ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES,
SPECIES MAY WELL CHANGE.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:36.300
ONLY THE FITTEST SURVIVE,
AND THAT WAS THE KEY.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:42.260
HE CALLED THE PROCESS
"NATURAL SELECTION".

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.560
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE
DIFFERENCES HE HAD NOTED

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.530
IN THE FINCHES HE HAD BROUGHT
BACK FROM THE GALAPAGOS.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.130
THEY WERE VERY SIMILAR
EXCEPT FOR THEIR BEAKS.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.460
THIS ONE HAS A VERY
THIN, DELICATE BEAK

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.330
WHICH IT USES
TO CATCH INSECTS.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.560
THIS ONE, ON THE OTHER HAND,
WHICH CAME FROM AN ENVIRONMENT

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.930
WHERE THERE WERE A LOT OF
NUTS, HAS A BIG, HEAVY BEAK

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.430
WHICH ENABLES
IT TO CRACK THEM.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:21.930
SO MAYBE OVER THE VASTNESS
OF GEOLOGICAL TIME,

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.960
AND PARTICULARLY IF SPECIES
WERE INVADING NEW ENVIRONMENTS,

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:31.530
THOSE CHANGES WOULD AMOUNT
TO VERY RADICAL CHANGES INDEED.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.200
DARWIN DREW A SKETCH IN ONE
OF HIS NOTEBOOKS TO ILLUSTRATE

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.460
HIS IDEA, SHOWING HOW A
SINGLE ANCESTRAL SPECIES

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:54.300
MIGHT GIVE RISE TO
SEVERAL DIFFERENT ONES.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:13:01.000
AND THEN WROTE ABOVE
IT A TENTATIVE "I THINK".

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.300
NOW HE HAD TO
PROVE HIS THEORY.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.100
AND HE SPENT YEARS
GATHERING ABUNDANT

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.360
AND CONVINCING
EVIDENCE.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.800
HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY
LETTER WRITER.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.630
HE WROTE AS MANY AS A DOZEN
LETTERS A DAY TO SCIENTISTS

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.030
AND NATURALISTS
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.000
HE ALSO REALIZED THAT WHEN
PEOPLE HAD FIRST STARTED

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.100
DOMESTICATING ANIMALS THEY HAD
BEEN DOING EXPERIMENTS FOR HIM

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:50.730
FOR CENTURIES.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:55.230
ALL DOMESTIC DOGS ARE DESCENDED
FROM A SINGLE ANCESTRAL SPECIES

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.730
- THE WOLF.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.060
DOG BREEDERS SELECT THOSE PUPS
THAT HAVE THE CHARACTERISTICS

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.700
THAT HAPPEN
TO PLEASE THEM.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.200
NATURE, OF COURSE, SELECTS
THOSE YOUNG ANIMALS

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.130
THAT ARE BEST SUITED TO A
PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT,

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.160
BUT THE PROCESS IS
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:21.800
AND IN BOTH CASES IT HAS
PRODUCED ASTONISHING VARIETY.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.360
IN EFFECT, MANY OF
THESE DIFFERENT BREEDS

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.500
COULD BE CONSIDERED
DIFFERENT SPECIES BECAUSE

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.860
THEY DO NOT - INDEED
THEY CANNOT - INTERBREED.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.960
FOR PURELY MECHANICAL
REASONS THERE'S NO WAY

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:43.160
IN WHICH A PEKINGESE CAN
MATE WITH A GREAT DANE.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:48.300
OF COURSE IT'S TRUE THAT IF YOU
USED ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.960
YOU COULD GET CROSSES BETWEEN
ALMOST ANY OF THESE BREEDS

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.160
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE HUMAN
BEINGS HAVE BEEN SELECTING

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.930
BETWEEN DOGS FOR
ONLY A FEW CENTURIES.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:01.500
NATURE HAS BEEN SELECTING
BETWEEN ANIMALS

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.430
FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.700
TENS OF MILLIONS, EVEN HUNDREDS
OF MILLIONS OF YEARS.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.030
SO WHAT MIGHT HAVE STARTED OUT
AS WE WOULD CONSIDER TO BE

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:16.530
BREEDS HAVE NOW BECOME SO
DIFFERENT THEY ARE SPECIES.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.460
DARWIN, SITTING IN DOWN HOUSE,
WROTE TO PIGEON FANCIERS AND

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.200
RABBIT BREEDERS ASKING ALL
KINDS OF DETAILED QUESTIONS

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.000
ABOUT THEIR
METHODS AND RESULTS.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.360
HE HIMSELF, BEING A COUNTRY
GENTLEMAN AND RUNNING AN ESTATE,

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.500
KNEW ABOUT BREEDING HORSES AND
SHEEP AND CATTLE AND HE ALSO

00:15:54.500 --> 00:16:01.000
CONDUCTED CAREFUL EXPERIMENTS
WITH PLANTS IN HIS GREENHOUSE.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.930
BUT THE IDEA THAT SPECIES
COULD APPEAR WITHOUT DIVINE

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:10.400
INTERVENTION WAS CONTRARY TO
THE BELIEFS OF HIS WIFE, EMMA.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.530
SHE WAS A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN AND
DARWIN KNEW THAT HIS THEORY

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:18.030
WOULD MOST CERTAINLY
APPALL SOCIETY IN GENERAL.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.330
PERHAPS FOR THAT REASON HE
KEPT ON REFINING HIS THEORY

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.960
AND DELAYING
PUBLICATION.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.130
BUT THEN HIS
HAND WAS FORCED.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:43.760
IN JUNE 1858, 22 YEARS AFTER HE
GOT BACK FROM THE GALAPAGOS,

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.400
HERE IN HIS STUDY IN DOWN HE
RECEIVED A PACKAGE FROM A

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.200
NATURALIST WHO WAS WORKING
IN WHAT IS NOW INDONESIA.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:17:00.200
HIS NAME WAS ALFRED
RUSSELL WALLACE.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.630
HE HAD BEEN CORRESPONDING
WITH DARWIN FOR SOME YEARS.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.800
BUT THIS PACKAGE
WAS DIFFERENT.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.730
IT CONTAINED AN ESSAY THAT
SET OUT EXACTLY THE SAME IDEA

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:16.330
AS DARWIN'S - OF EVOLUTION
BY NATURAL SELECTION.

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:19.700
THE IDEA HAD COME TO
WALLACE AS HE LAY IN HIS HUT

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.060
SEMI-DELIROUS IN
A MALARIAL FEVER.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.760
BUT ALTHOUGH HIS IDEA OF
NATURAL SELECTION WAS THE

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.460
SAME AS DARWIN'S, HE HAD NOT
SPENT 20 YEARS GATHERING THE

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:34.630
MOUNTAIN OF EVIDENCE TO
SUPPORT IT AS DARWIN HAD DONE.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.800
BUT WHO'S IDEA WAS IT?

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.030
IN THE END THE SENIOR
MEMBERS OF THE LINNAEAN,

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.160
A SCIENTIFIC
SOCIETY IN LONDON,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.560
DECIDED THAT THE FAIREST
THING WAS FOR A BRIEF OUTLINE

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.800
OF THEIR THEORIES TO BE READ
OUT ONE AFTER THE OTHER.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.160
NEITHER DARWIN NOR WALLACE
ATTENDED SO THE TWO PAPERS

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.330
WERE READ BY THE SECRETARY,
AND AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL

00:17:55.330 --> 00:18:02.900
THEY MADE VERY LITTLE
IMPRESSION ON ANYONE.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.830
DARWIN SPENT THE NEXT
YEAR WRITING OUT HIS THEORY

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:10.030
IN DETAIL, THEN HE SENT THE
MANUSCRIPT TO HIS PUBLISHER,

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:13.560
JOHN MURRAY, WHO'S FIRM,
THEN AS NOW, HAD OFFICES

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:18.630
IN ALBEMARLE STREET JUST
OFF PICCADILLY IN LONDON.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:22.860
THE FIRST EDITION OF 1,250
COPIES SOLD OUT IMMEDIATELY

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.230
AND IT WENT FOR A REPRINT
AND ANOTHER REPRINT

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.860
AND ANOTHER REPRINT.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.660
IT'S A BOOK THAT CONTAINS
VERY FEW TECHNICAL TERMS.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.660
IT'S EASILY
UNDERSTOOD BY ANYBODY.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.000
AND PREDICTABLY IT CAUSED AN
OUTRAGE, NOT ONLY THROUGHOUT

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.860
THIS COUNTRY, BUT INDEED
ALL THE CIVILIZED WORLD.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:47.660
WHAT SCANDALIZED PEOPLE MOST,
IT SEEMS, WAS THE IMPLICATION

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:52.130
THAT HUMAN BEINGS WERE NOT
SPECIALLY CREATED BY GOD

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.360
AS THE BOOK OF GENESIS
STATED, BUT WERE DESCENDED

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.830
FROM APE-LIKE ANCESTORS:
A NOTION THAT PROVIDED

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:04.060
A LOT OF SCOPE
FOR CARTOONISTS.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.100
THE LEADERS OF THE CHURCH,
HEADED BY SAMUEL WILBERFORCE,

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.660
THE BISHOP OF OXFORD,
ATTACKED IT ON THE GROUNDS

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.360
THAT IT DEMOTED GOD AND
CONTRADICTED THE STORY

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.730
OF CREATION AS
TOLD BY THE BIBLE.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.330
"THAT MR. DARWIN SHOULD
HAVE WANDERED FROM THIS

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.600
BROAD HIGHWAY OF NATURE'S
WORKS INTO THE JUNGLE OF

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.100
FANCIFUL ASSUMPTION
IS NO SMALL EVIL".

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.030
"I HAVE READ YOUR BOOK WITH
MORE PAIN THAN PLEASURE".

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:35.300
"IT IS THE FRENZIED INSPIRATION
OF THE INHALER OF MEPHITIC GAS."

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.830
"FAILS UTTERLY".

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:45.630
DARWIN'S THEORY IMPLIED THAT
LIFE ORIGINATED IN SIMPLE FORMS

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.800
AND HAD THEN BECOME
MORE AND MORE COMPLEX.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.000
HE KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT
THE WHOLE IDEA OF EVOLUTION

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.600
RAISED A LOT
OF QUESTIONS.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.260
IN FACT, SOME OF THOSE
QUESTIONS WOULD NOT

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.200
BE ANSWERED UNTIL
COMPARATIVELY RECENTLY.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.200
BUT IN HIS OWN TIME MANY
DISTINGUISHED SCIENTISTS

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.700
RAISED WHAT SEEMED TO BE
INSUPERABLE DIFFICULTIES.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.160
AND FOREMOST AMONG
THEM WAS RICHARD OWEN,

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.700
THE MAN WHO 20 YEARS
EARLIER HAD NAMED THE

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:21.560
EXTINCT GROUND SLOTH
IN HONOR OF DARWIN.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.500
OVER THE YEARS THE TWO MEN HAD
DEVELOPED A DEEP PERSONAL

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.300
DISLIKE OF ONE ANOTHER AND
HAD QUARRELED FREQUENTLY.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.260
IT WASN'T THAT OWEN
THOUGHT THAT THE STORY

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.460
OF THE GARDEN OF EDEN
WAS LITERALLY CORRECT,

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:45.730
BUT NONETHELESS HE WAS
A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS MAN.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:49.930
HE HAD, AFTERALL, ENSURED THAT
HIS MUSEUM, WHICH WOULD DISPLAY

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.360
THE WONDERS OF CREATION,
ECHOED IN ITS DESIGN

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:58.260
THE GREAT CHRISTIAN
CATHEDRALS OF MEDIEVAL EUROPE.

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:10.730
AND OWEN KNEW ABOUT
THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.860
INDEED, HE HAD SPENT HIS
WHOLE CAREER CATALOGING IT.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.430
BUT EVEN SO, HE REFUSED
TO BELIEVE THAT A SPECIES

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:22.730
COULD CHANGE
OVER TIME.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:26.760
HE AND OTHER PIONEER VICTORIAN
GEOLOGISTS, AS THEY ESTABLISHED

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.930
THEIR COMPARATIVELY NEW SCIENCE,
RECOGNIZED THAT THE OUTLINES

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:34.330
OF THE HISTORY OF LIFE COULD
BE DEDUCED BY EXAMINING

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:38.760
THE LAND AROUND THEM.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.400
LOOK AT THESE ROCKS
IN NORTHERN SCOTLAND.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.400
WE KNOW FROM FOSSILS THAT
ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.000
THAT THEY ARE
VERY ANCIENT.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.930
AND THEY ARE SANDSTONES,
COMPACTED SAND THAT WAS LAID

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:57.630
DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
LAYER UPON LAYER UPON LAYER.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:03.300
BUT LOOK HOW MANY
LAYERS THERE ARE!

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.260
CLEARLY THOSE AT THE TOP
MUST HAVE BEEN LAID DOWN

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.400
AFTER THOSE
BENEATH THEM.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.360
SO AS YOU DESCEND
FROM LAYER TO LAYER,

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.930
YOU ARE IN EFFECT
GOING BACK IN TIME.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:34.130
SO A FOSSIL SPECIES, IF IT
COMES FROM A PARTICULAR LAYER,

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.800
IS OF A PARTICULAR AGE.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.160
AND IF YOU CAN RECOGNIZE
EACH ONE, THEN YOU CAN BEGIN

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.800
TO PIECE TOGETHER THE
OUTLINES OF LIFE'S HISTORY.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:50.500
OWEN DID NOT DENY THE SEQUENCE
IN WHICH ALL THESE DIFFERENT

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:54.460
SPECIES APPEARED, BUT HE
BELIEVED THAT EACH WAS SEPARATE,

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.860
EACH DIVINELY CREATED.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.300
DARWIN'S THEORY, HOWEVER,
REQUIRED THAT THERE SHOULD BE

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.560
CONNECTIONS NOT JUST
BETWEEN SIMILAR SPECIES

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:08.930
BUT BETWEEN THE
GREAT ANIMAL GROUPS.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:13.930
IF FISHES AND REPTILES AND BIRDS
AND MAMMALS HAD ALL EVOLVED

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.560
FROM ONE ANOTHER, THEN
SURELY THERE MUST BE

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.430
INTERMEDIATE FORMS BETWEEN
THOSE GREAT GROUPS.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.930
AND THEY WERE MISSING.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:26.800
AND THEN JUST TWO YEARS
AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.500
THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES RICHARD
OWEN HIMSELF PURCHASED

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:35.500
THE MOST ASTONISHING
FOSSIL FOR HIS MUSEUM.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:41.800
IT HAD BEEN FOUND IN THIS
LIMESTONE QUARRY IN BAVARIA.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.730
THE STONE HERE SPLITS INTO
FLAT, SMOOTH LEAVES THAT

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:51.400
HAVE BEEN USED AS ROOFING
TILES SINCE ROMAN TIMES.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:56.800
MOST ARE BLANK, BUT OCCASIONALLY
WHEN YOU SPLIT THEM APART

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.100
THEY REVEAL A
SHRIMP OR A FISH.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:05.330
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST
THE TEMPTATION OF PULLING DOWN

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:10.660
ALMOST EVERY BOULDER YOU SEE
AND THEN OPENING IT LIKE A BOOK

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.460
TO LOOK AT EACH UNOPENED
PAGE TO SEE WHETHER

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:18.900
MAYBE IT CONTAINS
YET ANOTHER FOSSIL.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.800
BUT THIS FOSSIL WAS SOMETHING
UNPRECEDENTED.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.760
IT IS STILL ONE OF THE
GREATEST OF THE TREASURES

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:34.100
THAT ARE STORED IN THE
NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.260
AND THIS IS IT.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.130
IT'S CALLED
"ARCHAEOPTERYX".

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:47.030
IT HAS UNMISTAKABLE FEATHERS
ON ITS WINGS AND DOWN ITS TAIL.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:50.930
SO OWEN HAD NO HESITATION
IN CALLING IT A BIRD,

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:55.300
BUT IT WAS UNLIKE ANY OTHER
BIRD THAT ANYONE KNEW OF

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:59.130
BECAUSE IT HAD CLAWS ON
THE FRONT OF ITS WINGS,

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.300
AND AS WAS
LATER DISCOVERED,

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.200
IT DIDN'T HAVE A BEAK BUT
JAWS WITH TEETH IN IT,

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:09.560
AND A LINE OF BONES
SUPPORTING ITS TAIL.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.260
SO IT WAS PART
REPTILE, PART BIRD.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:18.160
HERE WAS THE LINK BETWEEN
THOSE TWO GREAT GROUPS

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.830
THAT WAS NO
LONGER MISSING.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:29.130
GOSH, YOU REALLY CAN SEE
THE FILAMENTS THERE.

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:34.200
OTHER EXAMPLES OF THE SAME
CREATURE SHOW ITS FEATHERS

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.530
EVEN MORE CLEARLY.

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:41.500
WE KNOW FROM THE BONES OF
ARCHAEOPTERYX THAT IT WAS

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.360
AT BEST A VERY
POOR FLIER.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.260
SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT
EVENTUALLY IT WAS SUPERSEDED

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:52.300
BY MORE MODERN, MORE
EFFICIENT BIRDS, AND THAT'S

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.660
THE FATE OF THESE LINKS
BETWEEN GREAT GROUPS.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.600
EVENTUALLY THEY BECOME EXTINCT
AND THE ONLY WAY WE KNOW

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.330
THEY EXISTED IS FROM
THEIR FOSSILIZED REMAINS.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:10.000
EVEN SO, THERE IS A BIRD ALIVE
TODAY THAT ILLUSTRATES THE LINK

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.060
BETWEEN MODERN
BIRDS AND REPTILES.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:21.430
THE HOATZIN NESTS IN THE SWAMPS
OF TROPICAL SOUTH AMERICA.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.230
THERE ARE CAIMAN IN THE
WATER BENEATH, READY TO

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:27.030
SNAP UP ANY CHICK THAT
MIGHT FALL FROM ITS NEST

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:30.400
SO AN ABILITY TO HOLD ON
TIGHT IS VERY VALUABLE.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:35.500
AND THE NESTLINGS HAVE A VERY
INTERESTING WAY OF DOING THAT.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.560
THE YOUNG STILL HAVE CLAWS
ON THE FRONT OF THEIR WINGS

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.960
AS ARCHAEOPTERYX DID.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.330
HERE IS VIVID EVIDENCE THAT THE
WINGS OF BIRDS ARE MODIFIED

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:48.500
FORELEGS AND ONCE HAD
TOES WITH CLAWS ON THEM.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.760
ALTHOUGH THE FOSSIL RECORD
PROVIDES AN ANSWER TO THE

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:57.800
PROBLEM OF MISSING LINKS, IT
ALSO POSED A MAJOR PROBLEM.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.200
IT STARTED
VERY ABRUPTLY.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.160
THE EARLIEST KNOWN
FOSSILS IN DARWIN'S TIME

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.660
CAME FROM A FORMATION
CALLED THE CAMBRIAN.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:11.700
AND THERE WERE TWO MAIN
KINDS: THESE WHICH LOOK LIKE

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.760
FRET-SAW BLADES ARE CALLED
GRAPTOLITES; AND THESE,

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:20.000
LIKE GIANT WOOD LICE, WHICH
ARE CALLED TRILOBITES.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.630
COULD IT REALLY BE THAT LIFE ON
EARTH STARTED WITH CREATURES

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.430
AS COMPLEX AS THESE?

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:46.400
AS A BOY I WAS A PASSIONATE
COLLECTOR OF FOSSILS.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:51.400
I GREW UP IN THE CITY OF
LEICESTER AND I KNEW THAT IN

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.030
THIS AREA NOT FAR FROM THE
CITY CALLED CHARNWOOD FOREST

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.260
THERE WERE THE OLDEST
ROCKS IN THE WORLD.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.660
OLDER EVEN THAN
THE CAMBRIAN.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:05.230
SO THEREFORE, BY DEFINITION,
THEY WOULD BE WITHOUT FOSSILS.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:08.300
THERE WAS NO POINT IN
ME LOOKING FOR FOSSILS

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.300
IN THESE
ANCIENT ROCKS.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:30.530
THERE WERE, IT'S TRUE, VERY
RARELY SOME RATHER ODD SHAPES

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:34.160
IN THESE ROCKS -
LIKE THIS ONE HERE.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.030
BUT THEY WERE DISMISSED
AS BEING SOME KIND OF

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:40.400
MECHANICAL ABERRATION.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.500
I MEAN, AFTERALL, HOW COULD
THERE BE ANYTHING LIVING

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.600
IN THESE EXTREMELY
ANCIENT ROCKS?

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:54.530
AND THEN IN 1957 A SCHOOL BOY,
WITH RATHER MORE PATIENCE AND

00:28:54.530 --> 00:29:00.830
PERSPICACITY THAN I HAD, FOUND
SOMETHING REALLY REMARKABLE

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:08.430
AND UNDENIABLY THE
REMAINS OF A LIVING CREATURE.

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.900
AND HERE IT IS IN LEICESTER
MUSEUM WHERE IT'S BEEN BROUGHT

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.660
FOR SAFE KEEPING.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.830
IT'S CALLED CHARNIA.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:21.830
WHO COULD DOUBT THAT THIS IS THE
IMPRESSION OF A LIVING ORGANISM?

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:26.560
IT HAS A CENTRAL STEM,
BRANCHES ON EITHER SIDE.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:30.960
IN FACT, IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN
SOMETHING LIKE THE SEA PENS

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.830
THAT TODAY GROW
ON CORAL REEFS.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:38.800
SINCE ITS DISCOVERY A
WHOLE RANGE OF ORGANISMS

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.160
HAVE BEEN FOUND IN ROCKS
OF THIS EXTREME AGE -

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:46.200
NOT ONLY HERE IN THE
CHARNWOOD FOREST

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.260
BUT IN MANY OTHER DIFFERENT
PARTS OF THE WORLD.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.700
FOSSIL HUNTERS
SEARCHING THESE ROCKS

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.900
IN THE EDIACARA HILLS
OF AUSTRALIA HAD ALSO

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.660
BEEN DISCOVERING
OTHER STRANGE SHAPES.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.630
AT FIRST MANY SCIENTISTS
REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:07.600
THESE FAINT IMPRESSIONS
WERE THE REMAINS OF JELLYFISH.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.730
BUT BY NOW ENOUGH SPECIMENS
HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:14.630
TO MAKE QUITE SURE THAT
THAT INDEED IS WHAT THEY ARE.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:26.230
SO NOW WE KNOW THAT LIFE DID
NOT BEGIN SUDDENLY WITH THOSE

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:32.730
COMPLEX ANIMALS OF THE CAMBRIAN;
IT STARTED MUCH, MUCH EARLIER.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:37.200
FIRST WITH SIMPLE MICROSCOPIC
FORMS WHICH EVENTUALLY BECAME

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.260
BIGGER BUT WHICH WERE
STILL SO SOFT AND DELICATE

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:45.960
THAT THEY ONLY VERY RARELY
LEFT ANY MARK ON THE ROCKS.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.060
THE QUESTION OF THE AGE OF THE
EARTH POSED ANOTHER PROBLEM

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.960
FOR DARWIN'S THEORY.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:57.530
IN THE 17TH CENTURY AN IRISH
BISHOP HAD USED THE GENEALOGIES

00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:01.060
RECORDED IN THE BIBLE THAT LEAD
BACK TO ADAM TO WORK OUT THAT

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:06.830
THE WEEK OF CREATION MUST HAVE
TAKEN PLACE IN THE YEAR 4004 BC.

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:10.760
THAT MAY SEEM TO US TO BE A
VERY NAIVE WAY OF DOING THINGS,

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.430
BUT WHAT OTHER METHOD
WAS THERE ANYWAY?

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:17.630
THE VICTORIAN GEOLOGISTS
HAD ALREADY CONCLUDED

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:20.360
THAT THE EARTH MUST BE
MILLIONS OF YEARS OLD,

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:24.960
BUT HOW MANY MILLIONS
NO ONE COULD SAY.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.560
THEN, LESS THAN 50 YEARS AFTER
THE PUBLICATION OF THE ORIGIN,

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.230
A DISCOVERY WAS MADE IN WHAT
SEEMED A TOTALLY DISCONNECTED

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:37.860
BRANCH OF SCIENCE THAT WOULD
ULTIMATELY PROVIDE THE ANSWER.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.960
A POLISH WOMAN WORKING
IN PARIS, MARIE CURIE,

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.130
DISCOVERED THAT SOME
ROCKS CONTAINED AN ELEMENT

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.700
CALLED URANIUM THAT
DECAYS OVER TIME

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:51.830
AT A STEADY RATE THROUGH A
PROCESS CALLED "RADIATION".

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:56.360
TODAY, A CENTURY AFTER SHE MADE
HER EXTRAORDINARY DISCOVERY,

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.360
THE METHOD OF DATING
BY MEASURING CHANGES

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:06.630
IN RADIOACTIVITY HAS
BECOME GREATLY REFINED.

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:09.930
THIS IS A SAMPLE TAKEN FROM
THOSE VERY ANCIENT ROCKS

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:11.900
IN CHARNWOOD FOREST.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:15.230
AND THESE TINY CRYSTALS
ARE REVEALED TO BE

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:20.360
562 MILLION YEARS OLD.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.930
THAT PROVIDES MORE THAN ENOUGH
TIME FOR NATURAL SELECTION

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:27.300
TO PRODUCE THE PROCESSION OF
FOSSILS THAT EVENTUALLY LEADS

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:31.960
TO THE LIVING ANIMALS AND
PLANTS WE KNOW TODAY.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.700
BUT THERE WAS
ANOTHER OBJECTION.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:39.060
IF ALL ANIMALS WITHIN A
GROUP HAVE A COMMON ORIGIN,

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:43.760
HOW IS IT THAT SOME KINDS
OF ANIMALS ARE DISTRIBUTED

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.800
THROUGHOUT THE
CONTINENTS OF THE WORLD -

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.100
EXCEPT FOR ANTARCTICA?

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:54.530
HOW IS IT THAT FROGS IN EUROPE
AND AFRICA ARE ALSO FOUND HERE

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:57.760
IN SOUTH AMERICA ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN?

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.300
BEARING IN MIND THAT FROGS
HAVE PERMEABLE SKINS

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:05.000
AND CAN'T SURVIVE
IN SEAWATER.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.660
DARWIN HIMSELF HAD A
COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.830
ONE WAS THEY MIGHT HAVE
FLOATED ACROSS ACCIDENTALLY

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:14.700
ON RAFTS OF VEGETATION,
AND THE OTHER IS THAT MAYBE

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.730
THERE WERE LAND BRIDGES
BETWEEN THE CONTINENTS.

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:21.700
BUT EVEN HE WAS NOT CONVINCED
BY EITHER EXPLANATION.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.860
BUT THEN IN THE 1960'S IT BECAME
POSSIBLE TO MAP THE SEA FLOOR

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.400
IN DETAIL.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.100
AND IT WAS DISCOVERED NOT
ONLY THAT THE CONTINENTS

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:41.530
HAVE SHIFTED, BUT THAT
THEY WERE STILL MOVING.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:45.400
NEW ROCK WELLS UP FROM
DEEP BELOW THE EARTH'S CRUST

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.900
AND FLOWS AWAY ON EITHER
SIDE OF THE MID OCEAN RIDGES,

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.660
CARRYING THE
CONTINENTS WITH IT.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:56.260
AMPHIBIANS HAD ORIGINALLY
EVOLVED ON THIS SUPERCONTINENT

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.260
AND HAD THEN TRAVELED ON
EACH OF ITS VARIOUS FRAGMENTS

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.700
AS THEY DRIFTED APART.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:06.360
PROBLEM SOLVED.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:10.660
PERHAPS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM
OF ALL FOR MOST PEOPLE WAS

00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:15.200
THE ARGUMENT PUT FORWARD
FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.530
AT THE BEGINNING OF
THE 19TH CENTURY

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:21.230
BY AN ANGLICAN CLERGYMAN
CALLED WILLIAM PALEY.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:24.400
HE SAID SUPPOSING YOU WERE
WALKING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.860
AND YOU PICKED UP
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.860
YOU WOULD KNOW FROM
LOOKING AT IT THAT IT HAD

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:38.200
BEEN DESIGNED
TO TELL THE TIME.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.330
THERE MUST, THEREFORE,
BE A DESIGNER.

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:44.560
AND THE SAME ARGUMENT WOULD
APPLY IF YOU LOOKED AT ONE OF

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:49.330
THE INTRICATE STRUCTURES FOUND
IN NATURE SUCH AS THE HUMAN EYE.

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:54.330
AND THE ONLY DESIGNER OF
THE HUMAN EYE COULD BE GOD.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:59.000
ANTI-EVOLUTIONISTS MAINTAIN
THAT THE EYE WOULD ONLY WORK

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.030
IF IT WAS COMPLETE
IN ALL ITS DETAILS.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:07.100
DARWIN, ON THE OTHER HAND,
ARGUED THAT THE EYE DEVELOPED,

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:12.030
BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMPLEX
OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:15.960
THAT WOULD ONLY WORK IF
EACH STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.700
WAS AN IMPROVEMENT
ON THE PREVIOUS ONE.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.960
AND TODAY WE KNOW ENOUGH
ABOUT THE ANIMAL KINGDOM

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:26.030
TO KNOW THAT THAT
IS INDEED THE CASE.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:29.630
SOME VERY SIMPLE ANIMALS
HAVE NOTHING MORE THAN

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.560
LIGHT-SENSITIVE SPOTS
THAT ENABLE THEM TO

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:36.030
TELL THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARK.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:39.360
BUT IF A PATCH OF SUCH SPOTS
FORMED EVEN THE SHALLOWEST

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.960
OF PITS, ONE EDGE OF THE
PIT WOULD THROW A SHADOW,

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.100
AND SO REVEAL THE
DIRECTION OF LIGHT.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.030
IF THE PIT GOT DEEPER
AND STARTED TO CLOSE,

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:53.460
THEN LIGHT WOULD
FORM A BLURRED IMAGE.

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.530
MUCUS SECRETED BY THE
CELLS WOULD BEND THE LIGHT

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:58.360
AND FOCUS IT.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:01.700
IF THIS MUCUS HARDENED IT
WOULD FORM A PROPER LENS

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:05.230
AND TRANSMIT A BRIGHTER
AND CLEARER IMAGE.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:09.500
ALL THESE DIFFERENT, FULLY
FUNCTIONAL STAGES AT DIFFERENT

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:14.330
LEVELS OF COMPLEXITY ARE
FOUND IN LIVING ANIMALS TODAY.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:17.460
THIS SINGLE-CELLED
CREATURE HAS ONE OF THOSE

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.800
LIGHT-SENSITIVE SPOTS.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.760
FLATWORMS HAVE A SMALL PIT
CONTAINING LIGHT SPOTS

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:28.330
SO THEY CAN DETECT THE
SHADOW OF A PREDATOR.

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:31.460
A SNAIL'S BLURRY VISION IS
GOOD ENOUGH TO ENABLE IT

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.930
TO FIND ITS
WAY TO FOOD.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:37.130
AND THE OCTOPUS HAS AN
EYE WITH A PROPER LENS

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:40.860
AND CAN SEE AS MUCH
DETAIL AS WE CAN.

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:48.330
SO THE STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN
EYE DOES NOT DEMAND THE

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:51.460
ASSISTANCE OF A SUPERNATURAL
DESIGNER, IT CAN HAVE EVOLVED

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:55.460
GRADUALLY WITH EACH STAGE
BRINGING A REAL ADVANTAGE,

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.760
AS DARWIN'S
THEORY DEMANDS.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.300
NATURAL SELECTION, OF COURSE,
REQUIRES THAT AN ANIMAL'S

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:11.460
CHARACTERISTICS ARE HANDED FROM
ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.330
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT CHILDREN
RESEMBLE THEIR PARENTS;

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:16.530
ANYONE KNOWS THAT.

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:21.800
BUT WHEN YOU COME TO THINK OF
IT, HOW DOES THAT COME ABOUT?

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.760
IN DARWIN'S TIME NOBODY HAD
THE FAINTEST IDEA ABOUT THE

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:29.760
MECHANISM OR THE RULES
THAT GOVERN THAT PROCESS.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:34.100
EXCEPT PERHAPS FOR ONE MAN
WHO WAS WORKING IN THE CITY

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.360
OF BRNO IN WHAT IS
NOW THE CZECH REPUBLIC

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.230
AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME
THAT DARWIN WAS WRITING

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.330
HIS BOOK IN KENT.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:46.300
THAT MAN'S NAME
WAS GREGOR MENDEL.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:50.560
HE DISCOVERED THE LAWS OF
INHERITANCE BY BREEDING

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.800
THOUSANDS OF PEA PLANTS AND
OBSERVING HOW THEY CHANGE

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.730
FROM ONE GENERATION
TO THE NEXT.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:38:00.460
HE FOUND THAT WHILE
MANY CHARACTERISTICS WERE

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.700
PASSED DOWN DIRECTLY FROM
ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER,

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.660
OTHERS COULD ACTUALLY
SKIP A GENERATION.

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.530
HOW COULD
THAT HAPPEN?

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:13.560
MENDEL EXPLAINED THIS BY
SUGGESTING THAT EACH PLANT,

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.930
EACH ORGANISM
CONTAINED WITHIN IT

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.960
FACTORS WHICH
WERE RESPONSIBLE

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:23.000
FOR CREATING THOSE
PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.330
TODAY WE CALL THOSE THINGS
"GENES", BUT NOBODY HAD ANY IDEA

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:33.300
HOW THEY WORKED UNTIL 100
YEARS AFTER MENDEL'S TIME.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:38.800
AND THEN THE ANSWER WAS
DISCOVERED IN CAMBRIDGE.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:44.800
IN 1953 HERE IN THE
CAVENDISH LABORATORIES,

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.960
TWO YOUNG RESEARCHERS,
FRANCIS CRICK AND JAMES WATSON,

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.230
WERE BUILDING
MODELS LIKE THIS.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:56.060
IT WAS THEIR WAY OF THINKING
ABOUT AND INVESTIGATING

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.800
THE STRUCTURE OF A
COMPLEX MOLECULE

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:05.260
THAT'S FOUND IN THE
GENES OF ALL ANIMALS: DNA.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:13.060
THE CRUCIAL BIT ARE THESE
CHAINS WHICH ENCIRCLE THE ROD.

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:17.700
AND HERE IS A SECOND,
AND ENTWINE.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:21.930
THIS IS A
DOUBLE HELIX.

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:26.460
THE WORKINGS OF THE
DNA MOLECULE ARE NOW

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.400
UNDERSTOOD IN SUCH DETAIL
THAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:33.300
SOMETHING THAT IS
TRULY ASTOUNDING.

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:38.830
A GENE TAKEN FROM ONE ANIMAL
CAN FUNCTION IN ANOTHER.

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.430
THE GENE THAT CAUSES THE
JELLYFISH TO BE LUMINOUS,

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:44.460
FOR EXAMPLE,
TRANSPLANTED INTO A MOUSE

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:48.260
WILL MAKE THAT
MOUSE LUMINOUS.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:59.160
THE GENETIC CODE CAN
ALSO REVEAL RELATIONSHIPS.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:03.830
EVEN OUR LAW COURTS ACCEPT THAT
DNA FINGERPRINTING CAN ESTABLISH

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:09.300
WHETHER A MAN IS THE
FATHER OF A PARTICULAR CHILD.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.700
AND IT CAN ALSO REVEAL
WHETHER ONE KIND OF ANIMAL

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:20.700
IS RELATED
TO ANOTHER.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.500
IT PROVES, FOR EXAMPLE,
THAT KANGAROOS,

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.730
GROUND LIVING ANIMALS
THAT RUN WITH GREAT LEAPS,

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:30.100
ARE CLOSELY
RELATED TO KOALAS

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.660
THAT HAVE TAKEN
TO CLIMBING TREES;

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:38.000
THAT INSECT-EATING SHREWS HAVE
COUSINS THAT TOOK TO THE AIR

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
IN SEARCH OF
INSECTS: BATS.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.200
AND THAT ONE BRANCH OF THE
ELEPHANT FAMILY WAY BACK IN

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:50.360
GEOLOGICAL HISTORY TOOK TO THE
WATER AND BECAME SEA COWS.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:54.800
SO 150 YEARS AFTER THE
PUBLICATION OF DARWIN'S

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.830
REVOLUTIONARY BOOK, MODERN
GENETICS HAS CONFIRMED

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:04.000
ITS FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH:
ALL LIFE IS RELATED.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.730
AND IT ENABLES US TO
CONSTRUCT WITH CONFIDENCE

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:13.830
THE COMPLEX TREE THAT
REPRESENTS THE HISTORY OF LIFE.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:19.760
IT BEGAN IN THE SEA SOME
3,000 MILLION YEARS AGO.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.930
COMPLEX CHEMICAL MOLECULES
BEGAN TO CLUMP TOGETHER

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:30.100
TO FORM MICROSCOPIC
BLOBS: CELLS.

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:33.930
THESE WERE THE SEEDS FROM WHICH
THE TREE OF LIFE DEVELOPED.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:36.760
THEY WERE ABLE TO SPLIT,
REPLICATING THEMSELVES

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.860
AS BACTERIA DO.

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:41.500
AND AS TIME PASSED
THEY DIVERSIFIED

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.460
INTO DIFFERENT GROUPS.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.200
SOME REMAINED
ATTACHED TO ONE ANOTHER

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.360
SO THAT THEY
FORMED CHAINS.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:52.060
WE KNOW THEM
TODAY AS ALGAE.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:55.230
OTHERS FORMED HOLLOW
BALLS WHICH COLLAPSED UPON

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:59.800
THEMSELVES, CREATING A
BODY WITH AN INTERNAL CAVITY.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.360
THEY WERE THE FIRST
MULTI-CELLED ORGANISMS.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.860
SPONGES ARE THEIR
DIRECT DESCENDANTS.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.300
AS MORE
VARIATIONS APPEARED,

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:13.860
THE TREE OF LIFE GREW
AND BECAME MORE DIVERSE.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:17.330
SOME ORGANISMS BECAME MORE
MOBILE AND DEVELOPED A MOUTH

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:22.160
THAT OPENED
INTO A GUT.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:27.060
OTHERS HAD BODIES
STIFFENED BY AN INTERNAL ROD.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:29.960
THEY UNDERSTANDABLY
DEVELOPED SENSE ORGANS

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.100
AROUND THEIR
FRONT END.

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.430
A RELATED GROUP HAD BODIES
THAT WERE DIVIDED INTO SEGMENTS

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:39.360
WITH LITTLE PROJECTIONS ON
EITHER SIDE THAT HELPED THEM

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.260
TO MOVE AROUND
ON THE SEA FLOOR.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.930
SOME OF THESE SEGMENTED
CREATURES DEVELOPED HARD

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:49.760
PROTECTIVE SKINS WHICH GAVE
THEIR BODIES SOME RIGIDITY.

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:55.800
SO NOW THE SEAS WERE FILLED WITH
A GREAT VARIETY OF ANIMALS.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:00.230
AND THEN AROUND 450 MILLION
YEARS AGO SOME OF THESE ARMORED

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:07.430
CREATURES CRAWLED UP OUT OF THE
WATER AND VENTURED ONTO LAND.

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:11.000
AND HERE THE TREE OF LIFE
BRANCHED INTO A MULTITUDE OF

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.200
DIFFERENT SPECIES THAT
EXPLOITED THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:18.560
IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:22.160
ONE GROUP OF THEM DEVELOPED
ELONGATED FLAPS ON THEIR BACKS

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.560
WHICH OVER MANY GENERATIONS
EVENTUALLY DEVELOPED INTO WINGS.

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.700
THE INSECTS HAD ARRIVED.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:38.460
LIFE MOVED INTO THE AIR AND
DIVERSIFIED INTO MYRIAD FORMS.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:41.660
MEANWHILE, BACK IN THE SEAS,
THOSE CREATURES WITH THE

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.160
STIFFENING ROD IN THEIR
BODIES HAD STRENGTHENED IT

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:48.460
BY ENCASING IT IN BONE.

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.630
A SKULL DEVELOPED WITH A
HINGED JAW THAT COULD GRAB

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:54.660
AND HOLD ON TO PREY.

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:58.160
THEY GREW BIGGER AND DEVELOPED
FINS EQUIPPED WITH MUSCLES

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:03.030
THAT ENABLED THEM TO SWIM
WITH SPEED AND POWER.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:07.400
SO FISH NOW DOMINATED
THE WATERS OF THE WORLD.

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.760
ONE GROUP OF THEM
DEVELOPED THE ABILITY

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:13.430
TO GULP AIR FROM
THE WATER'S SURFACE.

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:18.030
THEIR FLESHY FINS BECAME
WEIGHT-SUPPORTING LEGS

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:22.800
AND 375 MILLION YEARS AGO
A FEW OF THESE BACKBONED

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:28.000
CREATURES FOLLOWED THE
INSECTS ONTO THE LAND.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.360
THEY WERE AMPHIBIANS
WITH WET SKINS

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.730
AND THEY HAD TO RETURN TO
WATER TO LAY THEIR EGGS.

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:38.160
BUT SOME OF THEIR DESCENDANTS
EVOLVED DRY, SCALY SKINS

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.130
AND BROKE THEIR
LINK WITH WATER

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:43.730
BY LAYING EGGS WITH
WATER-TIGHT SHELLS.

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:47.830
THESE CREATURES, THE REPTILES,
WERE THE ANCESTORS OF TODAY'S

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:51.800
TORTOISES, SNAKES,
LIZARDS, AND CROCODILES.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.560
AND OF COURSE THEY
INCLUDED THE GROUP THAT,

00:44:54.560 --> 00:45:02.030
BACK THEN, CAME TO DOMINATE
THE LAND: THE DINOSAURS.

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:06.330
BUT 65 MILLION YEARS AGO A GREAT
DISASTER OVERTOOK THE EARTH.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.300
WHATEVER ITS CAUSE, A GREAT
PROPORTION OF ANIMALS

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.860
WERE EXTERMINATED.

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:18.930
ALL THE DINOSAURS DISAPPEARED
EXCEPT FOR ONE BRANCH

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:22.460
WHO'S SCALES HAD BECOME
MODIFIED INTO FEATHERS.

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:26.130
THEY WERE THE BIRDS.

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:28.260
WHILE THEY SPREAD
THROUGH THE SKIES

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:31.400
A SMALL, SEEMINGLY INSIGNIFICANT
GROUP OF SURVIVORS

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:35.330
BEGAN TO INCREASE IN NUMBERS
ON THE GROUND BENEATH.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:39.300
THESE CREATURES, DIFFERENT
FROM THEIR COMPETITORS IN THAT

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.660
THEIR BODIES WERE WARM AND
INSULATED WITH COATS OF FUR,

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:46.200
THEY WERE THE
FIRST MAMMALS.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.260
WITH MUCH OF THE
LAND LEFT VACANT

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:52.660
AFTER THE GREAT CATASTROPHE
THEY NOW HAD THEIR CHANCE.

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:55.460
THEIR WARM, INSULATED BODIES
ENABLED THEM TO BE ACTIVE

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:59.560
AT ALL TIMES - AT NIGHT AS
WELL AS DURING THE DAY;

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:04.230
AND IN ALL PLACES, FROM
THE ARCTIC TO THE TROPICS;

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:08.700
IN WATER AS
WELL AS ON LAND;

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:13.330
ON GRASSY PLAINS
AND UP IN THE TREES.

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:56.260
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT
ABOUT OUR CLOSE RELATIONSHIP

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.700
TO THESE CHIMPANZEES.

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:01.430
OUR BODIES
ARE SO SIMILAR.

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:05.300
THE PROPORTIONS OF OUR LIMBS
OR OUR FACES MAY DIFFER,

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.530
BUT OTHERWISE WE
ARE VERY, VERY SIMILAR.

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:12.800
THE ARRANGEMENT OF OUR INTERNAL
ORGANS, THE CHEMISTRY OF OUR

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:18.430
BLOOD, THE WAY OUR BODIES WORK -
ALL THESE ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL,

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:21.530
AND DNA CONFIRMS THAT.

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:26.360
INDEED, WE ARE AS CLOSELY
RELATED TO CHIMPANZEES

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.200
AND THE REST OF THE APES
AND MONKEYS AS, SAY,

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:33.830
LIONS ARE TO TIGERS AND TO
THE REST OF THE CAT FAMILY.

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:00.930
SUDDENLY AN IMAGE
FROM OUR REMOTE PAST

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:03.260
COMES VIVIDLY
TO LIGHT.

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:06.100
THE TIME WHEN OUR DISTANT
ANCESTORS, IN ORDER TO

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:09.330
KEEP UP WITH THE CHANGING
ENVIRONMENT, HAD TO WADE

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:13.660
AND KEEP THEIR HEADS ABOVE
WATER IN ORDER TO FIND FOOD.

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:17.830
THAT CRUCIAL MOMENT WHEN
OUR FAR DISTANT ANCESTORS

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:24.400
TOOK A STEP AWAY FROM BEING APES
AND A STEP TOWARDS HUMANITY.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.860
THE NATURAL HISTORY
MUSEUM IS ONE OF THE MOST

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.630
IMPORTANT MUSEUMS OF
ITS KIND IN THE WORLD.

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:42.430
RICHARD OWEN BROUGHT IT INTO
EXISTENCE, BUT OVER A CENTURY

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:46.030
LATER, DISCOVERIES FROM
MANY BRANCHES OF SCIENCE

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:49.600
HAVE SHOWN THAT HIS BELIEF
THAT SPECIES CAN NEVER CHANGE

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:55.030
BUT ALWAYS REMAIN EXACTLY
THE SAME WAS MISTAKEN.

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:16.930
IT WAS CHARLES DARWIN'S
PROFOUND INSIGHTS

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:19.600
THAT HAVE
PROVED TO BE TRUE.

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:24.100
AND NOW, TO MARK THE 200TH
ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH,

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:27.760
HIS STATUE IS BEING TAKEN FROM
ITS OUT-OF-THE-WAY LOCATION

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:33.660
TO BE PLACED CENTER
STAGE IN THE MAIN HALL.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.460
DARWIN'S GREAT INSIGHT
REVOLUTIONIZED THE WAY

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.660
IN WHICH WE
SEE THE WORLD.

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:56.400
WE NOW UNDERSTAND WHY THERE ARE
SO MANY DIFFERENT SPECIES,

00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:00.760
WHY THEY ARE DISTRIBUTED IN THE
WAY THEY ARE AROUND THE WORLD,

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:03.430
AND WHY THEIR BODIES
AND OUR BODIES ARE SHAPED

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:05.460
IN THE WAY
THAT THEY ARE.

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:09.800
BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT
BACTERIA EVOLVE, WE CAN DEVISE

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.300
METHODS OF DEALING WITH
THE DISEASES THEY CAUSE.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:16.860
AND BECAUSE WE CAN DISENTANGLE
THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:19.830
BETWEEN ANIMALS AND PLANTS
IN A NATURAL COMMUNITY,

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:22.500
WE CAN FORESEE SOME OF
THE CONSEQUENCES WHEN WE

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:27.060
START TO INTERFERE
WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:30.800
BUT ABOVE ALL, DARWIN HAS
SHOWN US THAT WE ARE NOT

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.530
APART FROM THE
NATURAL WORLD.

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:37.230
WE DO NOT HAVE
DOMINION OVER IT.

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:42.530
WE ARE SUBJECT TO ITS LAWS AND
PROCESSES AS ARE ALL OTHER

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:47.530
ANIMALS ON EARTH TO
WHICH INDEED WE ARE RELATED.
