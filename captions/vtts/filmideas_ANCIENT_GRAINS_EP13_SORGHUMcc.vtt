00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:11.500
(pulsing music)

00:00:33.208 --> 00:00:35.500
- [Voiceover] Cereal
production is one of the most

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.999
important industries
in the world today.

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:42.999
Cultivation and trade of
maize, rice, and wheat

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.542
continue to prosper,
especially now

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:48.625
that modern man seeks
meat alternatives

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:50.999
rich in protein and iron.

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:54.333
Aside from the so-called
"top three cereals",

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:58.417
smaller scale industries
are also presently dedicated

00:00:58.417 --> 00:01:02.834
to other ancient
grains such as sorghum.

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:05.709
Pinpointing sorghum's
exact origin

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:07.542
is still under investigation.

00:01:07.542 --> 00:01:10.375
But the widely-accepted
account of its emergence

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:14.291
was in Southern Egypt
about 8000 years ago.

00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:18.458
Domestication then flourished
in Ethiopia and Sudan

00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:22.917
until it spread throughout
the African continent.

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:25.083
During the 1st millennium BC,

00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:27.375
sorghum was believed
to have been used

00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:29.250
as food for sea voyages,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.917
which explains how
it reached India.

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:35.083
It then travelled further
eastward into Asia

00:01:35.083 --> 00:01:36.834
via the Silk Trade Route,

00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:40.375
while the African slave
trade in the 19th century

00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:43.458
brought sorghum westward
to the Americas.

00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:47.792
There are around 30 species
of sorghum known today,

00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:48.999
but the two most common are

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:54.083
Sorghum vulgare variety
technicum, or the broomcorn,

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:56.375
and Sorghum bicolor,

00:01:56.375 --> 00:01:58.709
or known simply as sorghum.

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.375
Sorghum bicolor is the
commercially produced species

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:04.375
and though it is
native to Africa,

00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:08.250
many cultivars are already
distributed around the world.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.250
It is an important
food crop in Africa,

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.000
Central America, and South Asia.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.667
And it is considered the fifth

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:18.999
most important
cereal in the world.

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:22.709
Before the 1940s, wild
varieties of sorghum

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.999
grew up to seven feet tall,

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.291
and posed harvesting setbacks.

00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:31.125
But sorghum has two or
three dwarfing genes in it,

00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:32.999
which researchers capitalized on

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:37.750
to create varieties that are
only two to four feet tall.

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:40.999
Sorghum roots spread
deep and wide.

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:44.792
It has a lateral distribution
of up to one meter

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:47.041
and a depth of up to two meters.

00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:49.999
It has a long, narrow,
pointed leaf blade

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:55.166
and average number of leaves
ranges from eight to 22.

00:02:55.458 --> 00:02:59.333
The stem of the sorghum plant
is long, solid, and sweet,

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:04.542
with a diameter ranging between
three and five millimeters.

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:07.041
It has internodes
which are coated

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:08.750
with a thick and waxy layer,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.458
which increases its
tolerance to drought.

00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:16.041
The panicle of
sorghum is compact,

00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:19.792
and contains 800
to 3000 kernels.

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:23.250
Kernel or grain colors
vary between black,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.000
red, brown, or tan.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.208
Planting sorghum is not
as demanding as maize.

00:03:30.417 --> 00:03:32.625
It's a warm weather
crop which needs

00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:34.375
at least 90 degrees Fahrenheit

00:03:34.375 --> 00:03:38.250
for it to perform
maximum photosynthesis.

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:42.583
Though sorghum and maize
share similar morphology,

00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:45.834
they however differ in
planting requirements.

00:03:45.834 --> 00:03:49.875
For example, unlike
maize, sorghum can thrive

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:51.083
in poor, sandy soil,

00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:54.417
as well as in low
potential, shallow soil

00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:56.917
with high clay content.

00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:59.041
Also an average rainfall range

00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:01.999
of 300 to 750mm

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.625
is all what sorghum
needs to grow,

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:07.291
which is not enough for maize.

00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:09.542
Sorghum is classified
according to

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:12.500
its purpose or
application, namely,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.083
grain sorghum for
human consumption,

00:04:16.083 --> 00:04:18.500
sweet sorghum for sweeteners

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.625
and lately for
ethanol production,

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.792
broom sorghum for brooms,

00:04:23.792 --> 00:04:27.999
and grass sorghum for
forage and silage use.

00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:30.750
It is called a
nature-cared crop,

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.792
because it doesn't require
too much fertilizer,

00:04:33.792 --> 00:04:36.583
irrigation, and pesticide.

00:04:36.583 --> 00:04:40.125
It actually has an organic
chemical compound called

00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:45.000
sorgoleone which it
uses to fight weeds.

00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:50.625
Sorghum may not be a
superstar like maize or rice

00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:53.999
but its undemanding nature
and ability to withstand

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:57.417
environments that are too
harsh for other cereals

00:04:57.417 --> 00:05:01.999
can make it a favorite
among farmers in the future.

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:16.625
The craze over whole
foods and whole grains

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:20.667
has put ancient grains in
the spotlight recently.

00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:24.542
Some of them however often
undergo refining processes

00:05:24.542 --> 00:05:27.834
to remove husks and
make them edible.

00:05:27.834 --> 00:05:30.333
Of course it's a known
fact that this refinement

00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:35.250
strips off not just husks,
but nutrients as well.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.999
It's a different
story with sorghum.

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:40.875
It has a husk, but
unlike other grains,

00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:44.041
this husk is edible
so it can be consumed

00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:48.834
with its outer layers along
with its untouched nutrients.

00:05:48.834 --> 00:05:51.999
Plus, sorghum is gluten free.

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:54.917
Wheat may be higher
in fiber and protein,

00:05:54.917 --> 00:05:59.291
but sorghum's nutrient values
do not trail far behind.

00:05:59.291 --> 00:06:02.999
Here's what 100g of
sorghum can give.

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:06.166
330 kilocalories of energy,

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:08.750
11.3g of protein,

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.583
74.63g of carbohydrates,

00:06:12.583 --> 00:06:15.750
and 6.3g of fiber.

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:20.500
Even in mineral content,
sorghum is competitive.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.291
It has 28mg of calcium,

00:06:23.291 --> 00:06:25.917
4.4mg of iron,

00:06:25.917 --> 00:06:28.709
190mg of magnesium,

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:32.041
287mg of phosphorus,

00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:35.208
350mg of potassium,

00:06:35.208 --> 00:06:37.959
6mg of sodium,

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:40.999
1.54mg of zinc,

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:43.999
1.08mg of copper,

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:48.000
and 1.63mg of manganese.

00:06:50.208 --> 00:06:51.667
Sorghum actually defeats

00:06:51.667 --> 00:06:54.999
the top three cereals
in iron content.

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:58.375
Maize only has 2.71mg,

00:06:58.375 --> 00:07:01.083
rice has a measly 0.8,

00:07:02.208 --> 00:07:05.792
while wheat has 3.19mg.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:09.000
Iron's main role in the
body is in the production

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.083
of hemoglobin in
red blood cells.

00:07:12.083 --> 00:07:15.417
Hemoglobin's task is
to transport oxygen

00:07:15.417 --> 00:07:17.875
from the lungs
throughout the body,

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:19.291
which is why insufficient levels

00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:23.250
may lead to decreased brain
function and immunity.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.999
A person with iron
deficiency often experiences

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:29.417
chronic fatigue and exhaustion.

00:07:29.417 --> 00:07:32.417
Men do not need the same
amount of iron as women.

00:07:32.417 --> 00:07:36.458
As a matter of fact, two
servings of 100g of sorghum

00:07:36.458 --> 00:07:38.959
in a day can already
provide the daily

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:43.999
dietary requirement of
8mg for adult males.

00:07:44.083 --> 00:07:47.417
Here is sorghum's
vitamin profile.

00:07:47.417 --> 00:07:50.959
Thiamin at 0.23mg,

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:54.834
riboflavin at 0.14mg,

00:07:54.834 --> 00:07:58.166
niacin at 2.9mg,

00:07:58.166 --> 00:08:02.709
pantothenic acid at 1.25mg,

00:08:02.709 --> 00:08:06.999
vitamin B6 at 0.59mg,

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:09.667
folate at 20mg,

00:08:09.667 --> 00:08:13.834
and vitamin E at 0.81mg.

00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:17.250
Sorghum is also a good source

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:21.375
of an essential amino
acid called leucine.

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:24.750
Based on cellular studies,
leucine is responsible

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.917
for activating a compound
in the muscles called

00:08:28.999 --> 00:08:29.999
MTOR,

00:08:29.999 --> 00:08:33.750
or mammalian target
of rapamycin.

00:08:34.667 --> 00:08:38.667
MTOR serves as a switch
that tells the muscles

00:08:38.667 --> 00:08:42.250
when to start or stop
protein manufacturing.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.250
So an ample amount of leucine

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.083
properly regulates
protein synthesis.

00:08:47.083 --> 00:08:51.000
And since the body cannot
produce leucine on its own,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.458
sorghum can be a dietary source.

00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:57.999
One property of sorghum
that sets it apart

00:08:57.999 --> 00:09:01.083
from the other grains
are the compounds called

00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:06.000
policosanols found in the
wax coating of the grain.

00:09:06.875 --> 00:09:09.917
According to research,
policosanol improves

00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:11.999
the body's blood lipid profile.

00:09:11.999 --> 00:09:14.999
In a study published in
the American Heart Journal

00:09:14.999 --> 00:09:19.083
in February 2002,
a 10mg daily dosage

00:09:19.083 --> 00:09:23.375
of policosanol can
decrease levels of LDL,

00:09:23.375 --> 00:09:26.333
or bad cholesterol, by 29%,

00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:30.041
and increase HDL,
or good cholesterol,

00:09:30.041 --> 00:09:32.999
by up to 15%.

00:09:34.709 --> 00:09:37.834
Studies have also
shown that policosanol

00:09:37.834 --> 00:09:40.999
can reduce risks of
cardiovascular disease

00:09:40.999 --> 00:09:45.250
such as atherosclerosis,
LDL oxidation,

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.083
and platelet aggregation.

00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:51.834
It has blood thinning
capabilities, like Aspirin.

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:54.999
With a competitive
nutritional profile,

00:09:54.999 --> 00:09:56.709
gluten-free characteristic,

00:09:56.709 --> 00:09:58.792
and unique policosanol content,

00:09:58.792 --> 00:10:01.834
sorghum definitely needs
the credit it deserves

00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:05.959
in the advancement of
human diet and nutrition.

00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:26.959
Even though sorghum has been
around for thousands of years,

00:10:27.999 --> 00:10:30.291
its significance
is largely attached

00:10:30.291 --> 00:10:33.834
to the African
culture and people.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.875
Sorghum is used to make
alcoholic beverages

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:45.542
such as the African
sorghum beer.

00:10:45.999 --> 00:10:49.959
It's a brownish-pink beer
with a fruity and sour taste,

00:10:49.959 --> 00:10:54.458
and alcohol content between
one and eight percent.

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:57.125
Many find this to be
quench satisfying.

00:10:57.125 --> 00:11:00.667
But this beer has a bigger
relevance and significance

00:11:00.667 --> 00:11:03.999
among the Black
African communities.

00:11:06.417 --> 00:11:09.291
In Durban, South Africa
in the earlier part

00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:10.667
of the 20th century,

00:11:10.667 --> 00:11:15.208
a segregation rule
was implemented called
the Durban System.

00:11:15.208 --> 00:11:19.417
Housed in accommodations on
the outskirts of urban areas,

00:11:19.417 --> 00:11:22.166
Black Africans could
maintain employment

00:11:22.166 --> 00:11:25.999
but required a permit
to enter the city.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.834
In Northern Sotho in Africa

00:11:58.834 --> 00:12:01.709
sorghum beer is called "bjala"

00:12:01.709 --> 00:12:03.834
and is used to
mark the unveiling

00:12:03.834 --> 00:12:05.959
of a loved one's tombstone.

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:08.500
The women usually
perform this task,

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.999
which requires days to complete.

00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:13.083
They first boil sorghum in water

00:12:13.083 --> 00:12:17.458
using huge iron pots
and over large bonfires.

00:12:17.458 --> 00:12:20.250
They let the mixture
ferment for several days

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.542
before finally
straining the mixture

00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:26.083
to extract the beer
for the ceremony.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:31.750
Sorghum beer is called by
different names such as

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.500
"burukutu" in Nigera,

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.417
"pombe" in East Africa,

00:12:37.417 --> 00:12:40.333
and "bil-bil" in Cameroon.

00:12:43.041 --> 00:12:45.500
A sorghum field and distillery

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.917
was also the main
backdrop and landscape

00:12:47.917 --> 00:12:51.999
for the 1987
Oscar-nominated Chinese film

00:12:51.999 --> 00:12:54.999
titled "Red Sorghum",

00:12:54.999 --> 00:12:57.917
based on the novel
"Red Sorghum Clan"

00:12:57.917 --> 00:13:00.542
by Nobel Laureate Mo Yan.

00:13:00.542 --> 00:13:04.750
Stretches of red sorghum
fields, like a sea of blood,

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.333
was the perfect visualization

00:13:06.333 --> 00:13:10.083
of a culture entrenched
in brutality and cruelty

00:13:10.083 --> 00:13:13.999
way before the onset
of World War II.

00:13:14.166 --> 00:13:15.792
It won the Golden Bear Award

00:13:15.792 --> 00:13:20.999
at the Berlin International
Film Festival in 1988.

00:13:25.709 --> 00:13:29.500
On a lighter note, the
variety Sorghum vulgare,

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.333
or broomcorn, can
be said to have

00:13:31.333 --> 00:13:36.208
enormously contributed to
house cleaning and keeping.

00:13:37.999 --> 00:13:40.542
Benjamin Franklin is
recognized to have introduced

00:13:40.542 --> 00:13:45.834
broomcorn to the United
States in the early 1700s.

00:13:47.125 --> 00:13:51.542
But it was in 1797 when a
farmer from Massachusetts

00:13:51.542 --> 00:13:56.000
named Levi Dickinson made
a broom out of sorghum

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.333
as a gift for his wife.

00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:01.417
Because of the sorghum
broom's good performance,

00:14:01.417 --> 00:14:03.999
Dickinson began
producing and selling

00:14:03.999 --> 00:14:07.750
sorghum straw brooms
in his neighborhood.

00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:14.500
By 1834 the broom
industry took flight,

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.709
and broom shops began
to open one by one.

00:14:20.625 --> 00:14:24.999
Today sorghum broomcorn is
used as a plant ornament

00:14:24.999 --> 00:14:26.166
and decorative wreaths,

00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:30.208
perfect during the fall
and autumn seasons.

00:14:39.417 --> 00:14:44.750
Sorghum is now slowly getting
recognized by many countries,

00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:51.959
so it's not too late for
this grain to make history

00:14:52.999 --> 00:14:54.999
and gain more cultural relevance

00:14:54.999 --> 00:14:57.999
and significance in the future.

00:15:22.208 --> 00:15:25.999
Sorghum is not called the
fifth most important cereal

00:15:25.999 --> 00:15:29.999
in the world with no
figures to back it up.

00:15:32.208 --> 00:15:37.125
It is planted and grown in
at least three continents.

00:15:37.999 --> 00:15:39.041
Africa,

00:15:39.834 --> 00:15:40.999
Asia,

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.917
and Northern America.

00:15:45.083 --> 00:15:47.750
Based on statistics
from the United Nations

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.291
Food and Agriculture
Organization,

00:15:50.291 --> 00:15:55.999
these are the top five sorghum
producers in the year 2012.

00:15:57.041 --> 00:15:59.709
Number one, Nigeria with

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:02.875
6,900,000 metric tons.

00:16:02.875 --> 00:16:05.291
Two, the United States with

00:16:05.291 --> 00:16:08.999
6,272,360

00:16:08.999 --> 00:16:10.834
metric tons.

00:16:10.834 --> 00:16:12.999
Number three, India with

00:16:12.999 --> 00:16:16.542
6,010,000 metric tons.

00:16:16.625 --> 00:16:18.999
Four, Argentina with

00:16:18.999 --> 00:16:23.709
4,252,310 metric tons.

00:16:23.709 --> 00:16:26.959
And number five, Ethiopia with

00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:30.999
3,604,262

00:16:30.999 --> 00:16:31.999
metric tons.

00:16:31.999 --> 00:16:35.583
Also in the top 10
are Burkina Faso,

00:16:35.583 --> 00:16:40.291
Niger, Chad, China, and Mali.

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:43.792
Sorghum continues
to play a huge part

00:16:43.792 --> 00:16:46.000
in human food
consumption as well as

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.750
in animal and livestock
feeding around the world.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.999
But a new use was recently
found for sorghum,

00:16:52.999 --> 00:16:56.291
particularly the
sweet sorghum variety.

00:16:56.291 --> 00:16:58.375
Ethanol production.

00:16:58.375 --> 00:17:01.333
In 2007 a collaborative project

00:17:01.333 --> 00:17:04.125
by the International
Crops Research Institute

00:17:04.125 --> 00:17:07.542
for the Semi-Arid
Tropics, or ICRISAT,

00:17:07.542 --> 00:17:09.917
and some private institutions.

00:17:09.917 --> 00:17:12.250
The first sorghum
bioethanol plant

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.208
became operational in
India and since then,

00:17:15.208 --> 00:17:19.709
produced over 10,000
gallons of ethanol daily.

00:17:19.709 --> 00:17:22.208
Converting sorghum
into ethanol requires

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:25.625
crushing the stalks to
extract sweet juices,

00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:28.999
and then fermenting and
distilling this sweet extract

00:17:28.999 --> 00:17:32.583
into a high-octane,
clean burning biofuel.

00:17:32.583 --> 00:17:36.999
Only the stalks of sorghum are
used in ethanol production,

00:17:36.999 --> 00:17:39.999
leaving the grains
available for food use

00:17:39.999 --> 00:17:41.208
and human consumption.

00:17:41.208 --> 00:17:45.125
The crushed stalks are then
used for animal fodder.

00:17:45.125 --> 00:17:48.083
It is for this reason
why sorghum is called

00:17:48.083 --> 00:17:49.999
an ideal smart crop,

00:17:49.999 --> 00:17:53.375
because one sorghum plant
can be used as food,

00:17:53.375 --> 00:17:57.375
fodder, and biofuel
at the same time.

00:17:58.583 --> 00:18:00.667
One reason why
pushing sweet sorghum

00:18:00.667 --> 00:18:05.875
for ethanol production is
ideal is because of its cost.

00:18:05.959 --> 00:18:09.333
Producing a gallon of
ethanol from sweet sorghum

00:18:09.333 --> 00:18:12.375
only costs $1.74,

00:18:12.375 --> 00:18:15.834
compared to $2.19
from sugar cane

00:18:15.834 --> 00:18:18.291
and $2.12 from maize.

00:18:18.291 --> 00:18:22.667
Also since sorghum can
thrive in low fertile soils,

00:18:22.667 --> 00:18:24.999
forests and other
productive crop land

00:18:24.999 --> 00:18:27.999
are not sacrificed for
ethanol production.

00:18:27.999 --> 00:18:31.333
Today numerous projects
focused on producing

00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:33.999
renewable energy
from sweet sorghum

00:18:33.999 --> 00:18:36.041
are on their way in
countries such as

00:18:36.041 --> 00:18:39.917
Australia, Portugal,
the United States,

00:18:39.917 --> 00:18:42.917
Ghana, Brazil, France,

00:18:42.917 --> 00:18:45.999
Taiwan, Thailand, and Canada.

00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:49.542
China is the ninth major
producer of sorghum,

00:18:49.542 --> 00:18:52.250
but in 2013 it imported over

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.792
60,000 metric tons of sorghum

00:18:54.792 --> 00:18:57.417
from the United States
for animal feed.

00:18:57.417 --> 00:19:00.999
It turned out that China's
large private feed mills

00:19:00.999 --> 00:19:04.166
already exhausted their
import allocations for corn,

00:19:04.166 --> 00:19:08.750
so their second best choice
for animal feed is sorghum.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:12.291
Since domestic corn production
in China is expensive,

00:19:12.291 --> 00:19:15.999
importing sorghum from the
US for alcohol production

00:19:15.999 --> 00:19:19.000
and animal feed is a
more cost-efficient move

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.625
for the government,
and by extension,

00:19:21.625 --> 00:19:25.709
good news to sorghum
farmers in the US.

00:19:32.291 --> 00:19:35.834
Continuous research on
sorghum is still conducted,

00:19:35.834 --> 00:19:39.333
especially on developing
a commercialized hybrid

00:19:39.333 --> 00:19:42.625
that is more tolerant
of colder temperatures.

00:19:42.625 --> 00:19:47.917
A cold-tolerant variety can
expand sorghum's agronomics

00:19:47.917 --> 00:19:51.792
and increase total yield,
resulting in an alternative,

00:19:51.792 --> 00:19:54.583
viable, and sustainable
source of food,

00:19:54.583 --> 00:19:58.917
fodder, and ethanol
other than maize.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.999
Sorghum has been a staple grain

00:20:16.999 --> 00:20:20.083
for many ethnicities in
the African continent,

00:20:20.083 --> 00:20:23.000
so there's no reason
why this ancient grain

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.999
should not find its
way to dinner tables

00:20:25.999 --> 00:20:28.375
of other cultures and countries.

00:20:28.375 --> 00:20:31.750
Sorghum flour is often
used as a substitute

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.999
for wheat flour in baked goods.

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:36.250
Many can easily get
accustomed to it

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.500
due to its natural sweetness.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.333
However, since sorghum
is gluten free,

00:20:41.333 --> 00:20:44.999
binders such as sap
and gum or cornstarch

00:20:44.999 --> 00:20:48.792
is needed to give
baked goods stretch.

00:20:48.792 --> 00:20:52.834
Here is a cookie recipe
using sorghum flour.

00:20:52.834 --> 00:20:53.500
You'll need

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.417
three quarters of a
cup of sorghum flour,

00:20:56.417 --> 00:20:58.999
one half cup of tapioca flour,

00:20:58.999 --> 00:21:01.875
a quarter cup of potato starch,

00:21:01.875 --> 00:21:04.375
one teaspoon of xanthan gum,

00:21:04.375 --> 00:21:07.208
one half teaspoon
of baking soda,

00:21:07.208 --> 00:21:09.834
one quarter teaspoon of salt,

00:21:09.834 --> 00:21:11.834
a quarter cup of margarine,

00:21:11.834 --> 00:21:14.333
three quarters cup
of brown sugar,

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:17.250
one third cup of
granulated sugar,

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.250
two teaspoons of
vanilla extract,

00:21:20.375 --> 00:21:22.458
one extra large egg,

00:21:22.458 --> 00:21:24.291
one cup of chocolate chips,

00:21:24.291 --> 00:21:27.083
and a quarter cup
of chopped nuts.

00:21:27.083 --> 00:21:30.999
Preheat oven to 350
degrees Fahrenheit,

00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:33.041
or 180 degrees Celsius

00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:35.917
and grease a large baking sheet.

00:21:35.917 --> 00:21:39.959
In a bowl mix all the
flours, baking soda,

00:21:39.959 --> 00:21:42.250
xanthan gum, and salt.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:43.999
Let it sit for awhile.

00:21:43.999 --> 00:21:47.542
In a large bowl beat
margarine, brown sugar,

00:21:47.542 --> 00:21:50.999
white sugar, vanilla
extract, and egg

00:21:50.999 --> 00:21:52.291
until light and fluffy.

00:21:52.291 --> 00:21:56.333
While on low speed, gradually
beat in the flour mixture

00:21:56.333 --> 00:21:58.834
until everything
is incorporated.

00:21:58.834 --> 00:22:02.000
Then fold in the
chocolate chips and nuts.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.834
Scoop one tablespoon
full of dough

00:22:04.834 --> 00:22:06.625
and drop on the baking sheet.

00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:10.041
Repeat the process until
all dough is used up.

00:22:10.041 --> 00:22:14.250
Make sure dough balls are
at least two inches apart.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.917
Bake for 10 to 12
minutes and cool

00:22:16.917 --> 00:22:19.999
before removing from
the baking sheet.

00:22:19.999 --> 00:22:22.999
Here's another sweet
sorghum dessert,

00:22:22.999 --> 00:22:25.834
baked apples with sorghum syrup.

00:22:25.834 --> 00:22:27.375
Prepare the following.

00:22:27.375 --> 00:22:29.125
Two medium apples,

00:22:29.125 --> 00:22:31.041
one cup apple cider,

00:22:31.041 --> 00:22:33.166
the zest of one lemon,

00:22:33.166 --> 00:22:36.500
one half teaspoon
of brown cinnamon,

00:22:36.999 --> 00:22:39.709
two tablespoons softened butter,

00:22:39.709 --> 00:22:42.333
one tablespoon chopped pecans,

00:22:42.333 --> 00:22:45.333
two tablespoons rolled oats,

00:22:45.333 --> 00:22:47.625
one tablespoon raisins,

00:22:47.625 --> 00:22:50.834
four tablespoons sorghum syrup,

00:22:50.834 --> 00:22:53.041
one fourth cup heavy cream,

00:22:53.041 --> 00:22:54.834
and a pinch of cinnamon.

00:22:54.834 --> 00:22:59.208
Preheat oven to 375
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:22:59.208 --> 00:23:00.250
Core the apples.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:04.041
In a small baking dish,
pour the apple cider.

00:23:04.041 --> 00:23:07.000
In a small bowl
combine the lemon zest,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.166
ground cinnamon, butter, pecans,

00:23:11.166 --> 00:23:13.542
rolled oats, raisins,

00:23:13.542 --> 00:23:15.999
and three tablespoons
sorghum syrup.

00:23:15.999 --> 00:23:20.166
Combine well, then spoon
the mixture into each apple.

00:23:20.166 --> 00:23:23.542
Place the apples in the
baking dish with the cider.

00:23:23.542 --> 00:23:26.542
Cover with foil and
bake for 30 minutes.

00:23:26.542 --> 00:23:29.625
Afterwards, remove foil
and return to the oven

00:23:29.625 --> 00:23:33.500
for another 10 minutes or
until apples are tender.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.625
Prepare the cream by
whipping the chilled cream,

00:23:36.625 --> 00:23:39.291
cinnamon, and one
tablespoon sorghum syrup

00:23:39.291 --> 00:23:42.875
in a small bowl
until peaks form.

00:23:42.875 --> 00:23:44.208
Remove the apples from the oven

00:23:44.208 --> 00:23:47.999
and immediately scoop the
cold cream over each apple.

00:23:47.999 --> 00:23:52.208
Drizzle some of the juices
from the baking dish on top.

00:23:52.208 --> 00:23:54.542
With sorghum's
natural sweetness,

00:23:54.542 --> 00:23:57.834
it can be easily incorporated
into numerous dishes

00:23:57.834 --> 00:24:01.458
as a sweetener and
even as a marinade.

00:24:01.458 --> 00:24:04.041
This is the grain for
anyone with a penchant

00:24:04.041 --> 00:24:07.083
for a sweet treat
and a sweet life.
