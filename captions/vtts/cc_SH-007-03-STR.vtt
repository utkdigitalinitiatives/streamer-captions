00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670


2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.630
These promises are fair, theparties sure,

3
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.900
and our induction full ofprosperous hope.

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.770
Lord Mortimer and cousinGlendower,

5
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.300
will you sit down?

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.570
And uncle Worcester.

7
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.100
A plague upon it.

8
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.770
I have forgot the map.

9
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.300
No, here it is.

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.170
Sit, cousin Percy.

11
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.400
Sit, good cousin Hotspur.

12
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.730
For by that name as oft asLancaster doth speak of you,

13
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.000
his cheek looks pale,

14
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.430
and with a rising sigh, hewisheth you in heaven.

15
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.530
And you in hell

16
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.430
as oft as he hears OwenGlendower spoke of.

17
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.200
I cannot blame him.

18
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.970
At my nativity, the front ofheaven

19
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.200
was full of fiery shapes, ofburning cressets.

20
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.470
And at my birth, the frame andhuge foundation

21
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.470
of the earth shaked like acoward.

22
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.430
Why, so it would have done atthe same season

23
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.170
if your mother's cat had butkittened,

24
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.830
though yourself had never beenborn.

25
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.300
I say the earth did shake when Iwas born.

26
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.270
And I say the earth was not ofmy mind,

27
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.330
if you suppose as fearing you itshook.

28
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.630
The heavens were all on fire.The earth did tremble.

29
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.230
Oh, then the earth shook to seethe heavens on fire

30
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.700
and not in fear of yournativity.

31
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.130
Cousin, of many men I do notbear these crossings.

32
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.700
Give me leave to tell you onceagain

33
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.830
that at my birth,

34
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.800
the front of heaven was full offiery shapes.

35
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.300
The goats ran from themountains,

36
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.070
and the herds were strangelyclamorous

37
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.470
to the frighted fields.

38
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.330
These signs have mark'd meextraordinary!

39
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.900
I think there's no man speaksbetter Welsh.

40
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.530
I'll to dinner.

41
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.130
Peace, cousin Percy.

42
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.330
You will make him mad.

43
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.930
I can call spirits from thevasty deep!

44
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.800
Why, so can I, or so can anyman.

45
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.370
But will they come when you docall for them?

46
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.600
Why, I can teach you, cousin, tocommand the devil.

47
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.530
And I can teach thee, coz, toshame the devil

48
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.530
by telling truth.

49
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.500
Tell truth and shame the devil.

50
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.900
If thou have power to raise him,bring him hither,

51
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.430
and I'll be sworn I have thepower to shame him hence.

52
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.300
O, while you live, tell truthand shame the devil!

53
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.200
Come, come; no more of thisunprofitable chat.

54
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.830
Three times hath HenryBolingbroke

55
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.300
made head against my power.

56
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.930
Thrice from the banks of Wye andsandy-bottom'd Severn

57
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.430
have I sent him bootless homeand weather-beaten back.

58
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.400
Home without boots, and in foulweather too.

59
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.170
How 'scapes he agues, in thedevil's name?

60
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.470
Come! Here is the map.

61
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.630
Shall we divide our right

62
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.870
according to our threefold orderta'en?

63
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.830
The archdeacon hath divided itinto three limits very equally:

64
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.370
England, from Trent and Severnhitherto,

65
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.970
by south and east is to my partassign'd.

66
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.830
All westward, Wales beyond theSevern shore

67
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.970
and all the fertile lands withinthat bound,

68
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:32.970
to Owen Glendower.

69
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.130
And, dear coz, to you

70
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.530
the remnant northward, lying offfrom Trent.

71
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.130
And our indentures tripartiteare drawn,

72
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.070
which being sealedinterchangeably,

73
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.100
a business that this night mayexecute,

74
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.930
tomorrow, cousin Percy, you andI

75
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.500
and my good Lord of Worcesterwill set forth

76
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.430
to meet your father and theScottish power,

77
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.630
as is appointed us, atShrewsbury.

78
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.500
My father Glendower is not readyyet,

79
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.500
nor shall we need his help thesefourteen days.

80
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.600
Within that space, you may havedrawn together

81
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.900
your tenants, friends, andneighboring gentlemen.

82
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.330
Methinks my moiety, north fromBurton here,

83
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.400
in quantity equals not one ofyours.

84
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.730
See how this river comes mecranking in

85
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.400
and cuts me from the best of allmy land

86
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.770
a huge half-moon, a monstrouscantle out.

87
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.530
I'll have the current in thisplace damm'd up.

88
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.130
And here the smug and silverTrent

89
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.170
shall run in a new channel, fairand evenly.

90
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.130
It shall not wind with such adeep indent

91
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.730
to rob me of so rich a bottomhere.

92
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.230
Not wind?

93
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.930
It shall. It must.

94
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.000
You see it doth.

95
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.870
Yea, but mark how he bears hiscourse

96
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.370
and runs me up with likeadvantage

97
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.870
on the other side,

98
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.470
gelding the opposed continent asmuch as on the other side,

99
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.600
it takes from you.

100
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.570
Yea, but a little charge willtrench him here

101
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.500
and on this north side win thiscape of land.

102
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.970
And then he runs straight andeven.

103
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.370
I'll have it so.

104
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.700
A little charge will do it.

105
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.570
I'll not have it alter'd.

106
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.770
Will not you?

107
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.170
No, nor you shall not.

108
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.470
Who shall say me nay?

109
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.530
Why, that will I.

110
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.030
Let me not understand you, then;speak it in Welsh.

111
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.900
I can speak English, lord, aswell as you,

112
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.800
for I was train'd up in theEnglish court,

113
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.930
where, being but young, I framedto the harp

114
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.630
many an English ditty lovelywell

115
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.500
and gave the tongue a helpfulornament,

116
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.500
a virtue that was never seen inyou.

117
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.700
Marry, and I'm glad of it withall my heart.

118
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.500
I'd rather be a kitten and crymew

119
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.770
than one of these same meterballad-mongers.

120
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.600
I'd rather hear a brazencanstick turn'd

121
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.900
or a dry wheel grate on theaxle-tree.

122
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.130
And that would set my teethnothing on edge,

123
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.930
nothing so much as mincingpoetry.

124
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.330
'Tis like the forced gait of ashuffling nag.

125
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
Come; you shall have Trentturn'd.

126
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.570
I do not care.

127
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.730
I'll give thrice so much land toany well-deserving friend.

128
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.800
But in the way of bargain, markye me,

129
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.770
I'll cavil on the ninth part ofa hair.

130
00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.900
Are the indentures drawn?

131
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.970
Shall we be gone?

132
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.100
The moon shines fair.

133
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.500
You may away by night.

134
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.170
I'll haste the writer and withalbreak with your wives

135
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.770
of your departure hence.

136
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.130
I am afraid my daughter will runmad,

137
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.530
so much she doteth on herMortimer.

138
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.230
Fie, cousin Percy.

139
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.370
How you cross my father.

140
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.670
I cannot choose.

141
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.230
Sometimes he angers me

142
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.230
with telling me of the mouldwarpand the ant

143
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.670
and such a deal ofskimble-skamble stuff

144
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.030
as puts me from my faith.

145
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.670
I tell you what; he held me lastnight

146
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.300
at least nine hours in reckoningup

147
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.530
the several devils' names thatwere his lackeys.

148
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.630
I cried "hum" and "well, go to"

149
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.600
and mark'd him not a word.

150
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.930
Oh, he's as tedious as a tiredhorse,

151
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.100
a railing wife, worse than asmoky house.

152
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.900
I'd rather live with cheese andgarlic in a windmill, far,

153
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.670
than feed on cates and have himtalk to me

154
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.330
in any summer-house inChristendom.

155
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.500
In faith, he is a worthygentleman,

156
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.430
exceedingly well read

157
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.600
and profited in strangeconcealments,

158
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.470
valiant as a lion, and wondrousaffable

159
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.770
and bountiful as mines of India.

160
00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.130
Shall I tell you, cousin?

161
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.270
He holds your temper in a highrespect

162
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.230
and curbs himself even of hisnatural scope

163
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.700
when you come 'cross his humor.

164
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.270
Faith, he does.

165
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.100
I warrant you, that man is notalive

166
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.930
might so have tempted him as youhave done

167
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.700
without the taste of danger andreproof.

168
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.430
But do not use it oft, let meentreat you.

169
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.200
In faith, my lord, you are toowillful-blame

170
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.500
and, since your coming hither,have done enough

171
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.170
to put him quite beside hispatience.

172
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.370
You must needs learn, lord, toamend this fault.

173
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.370
Well, I am school'd.

174
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.570
Good manners be your speed.

175
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.200
Here come our wives.

176
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.770
Let us take our leave.

177
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.170
This is the deadly spite thatangers me.

178
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.370
My wife can speak no English, Ino Welsh.

179
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.730
My daughter weeps.

180
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.130
She'll not part with you.

181
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.230
She'll be a soldier too.

182
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.500
She'll to the wars.

183
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.170
Good father, tell her that sheand my aunt Percy

184
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.430
shall follow in your conductspeedily.

185
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:31.570
She is desperate here--

186
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.370
a peevish self-willed harlotry,

187
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.130
one that no persuasion can dogood upon.

188
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.400
I understand thy looks.

189
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.630
That pretty Welsh which thoupour'st down

190
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.700
from these swelling heavens I amtoo perfect in.

191
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.300
And, but for shame,

192
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.270
in such a parley should I answerthee.

193
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.400
I understand thy kisses and thoumine,

194
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.030
and that's a feelingdisputation.

195
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.830
But I will never be a truant,love,

196
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.430
till I have learned thylanguage,

197
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.370
for thy tongue makes Welsh assweet

198
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.270
as ditties highly penn'd,

199
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.900
sung by a fair queen in asummer's bower,

200
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.630
with ravishing division, to herlute.

201
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.570
Nay, if you melt, then will sherun mad.

202
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.600
Oh, I am ignorance itself inthis!

203
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.570
She bids you on the wantonrushes lay you down

204
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.470
and rest your gentle head uponher lap,

205
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.730
and she will sing the song thatpleaseth you

206
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.370
and on your eyelids crown thegod of sleep,

207
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.530
charming your blood withpleasing heaviness,

208
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.770
making such difference 'twixtwake and sleep

209
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.700
as is the difference betwixt dayand night

210
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.730
the hour before theheavenly-harness'd team

211
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.600
begins his golden progress inthe east.

212
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.430
With all my heart, I'll sit andhear her sing.

213
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:33.600
By that time will our book, Ithink, be drawn.

214
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.130
Do so.

215
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.370
And those musicians that shallplay to you

216
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.300
hang in the air a thousandleagues from hence,

217
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.970
and straight they shall be here.

218
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.000
Sit, and attend.

219
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.600
Come, Kate.

220
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.200
Thou art perfect in lying down.

221
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.170
Quick, quick, that I may lay myhead in thy lap.

222
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.330
Oh, go, ye giddy goose.

223
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.470
Now I perceive the devilunderstands Welsh.

224
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.970
And 'tis no marvel he's sohumorous.

225
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.970
By'r lady,,he is a goodmusician.

226
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.170
Yes.

227
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.600
Then should you be nothing butmusical,

228
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.200
for you are altogether governedby humors.

229
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.830
Lie still, ye thief,

230
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.170
and hear the lady sing in Welsh.

231
00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.370
I had rather hear, lady, mybrach, howl in Irish.

232
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.200
Oh, wouldst thou have thy headbroken?

233
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.900
-No. -Then be still.

234
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.900
Neither. 'Tis a woman's fault.

235
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.170
Now God help thee.

236
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:33.200
To the Welsh lady's bed.

237
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.630
What's that?

238
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.200
Peace, she sings.

239
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.930
Come, Kate. I'll have your songtoo.

240
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.600
Not mine, in good sooth.

241
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.130
Not yours, in good sooth?

242
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.730
Heart, you swear like acomfit-maker's wife.

243
00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:01.270
"Not you, in good sooth," and"as sure as I live"

244
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.670
and "as God shall mend me," and"as sure as day"

245
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.730
and givest such sarcenet suretyfor thy oaths

246
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.030
as if thou never walk'st furtherthan Finsbury.

247
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.730
Swear me, Kate, like a lady asthou art,

248
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.630
a good mouth-filling oath, andleave "in sooth"

249
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.170
and such protest ofpepper-gingerbread

250
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.530
to velvet-guards andSunday-citizens.

251
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.800
Come, sing.

252
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.870
I will not sing.

253
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.270
'Tis the next way to turn tailor

254
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.230
or be red-breast teacher.

255
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.530
An the indentures be drawn,

256
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.730
I'll away within these twohours.

257
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.070
And so come in when ye will.

258
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.730
Come, come, Lord Mortimer.

259
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.530
You are as slow as hot LordPercy is on fire to go.

260
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:01.830
By this our book is drawn.

261
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.330
We'll but seal, and then tohorse immediately.

262
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.130
With all my heart.

263
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:27.070
I know not whether God will haveit so,

264
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.530
for some displeasing service Ihave done,

265
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:35.130
that, in his secret doom, out ofmy blood

266
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:39.330
he'll breed revengement and ascourge for me.

267
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.230
But thou dost in thy passages oflife

268
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.600
make me believe that thou artonly mark'd

269
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.000
for the hot vengeance and therod of heaven

270
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.930
to punish my mistreadings.

271
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.900
Tell me else,

272
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.270
could such inordinate and lowdesires,

273
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:05.030
such poor, such bare, such lewd,such mean attempts,

274
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:09.570
such barren pleasures, rudesociety

275
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.300
as thou art match'd withal andgrafted to

276
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.830
accompany the greatness of thyblood

277
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.870
and hold their level with thyprincely heart?

278
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.730
So please your majesty, I wouldI could quit

279
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.630
all offenses with as clearexcuse

280
00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.330
as well as I am doubtless I canpurge myself

281
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.030
of many I am charged withal.

282
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.530
God pardon thee.

283
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:35.170
Yet let me wonder, Harry, at thyaffections,

284
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.670
which do hold a wing quite fromthe flight

285
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.370
of all thy ancestors.

286
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.470
Thy place in council, thou hastrudely lost

287
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.500
which by thy younger brother issupplied

288
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.800
and art almost an alien to thehearts

289
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.530
of all the court and princes ofmy blood.

290
00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:59.600
The hope and expectation of thytime is ruin'd,

291
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.970
and the soul of every man

292
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.600
prophetically do forethink thyfall.

293
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.400
Had I so lavish of my presencebeen,

294
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.870
so common-hackney'd in the eyesof men,

295
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.300
so stale and cheap to vulgarcompany,

296
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.230
opinion, that did help me to thecrown,

297
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.600
had still kept loyal topossession

298
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.170
and left me in reputelessbanishment,

299
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:34.630
a fellow of no mark norlikelihood.

300
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:41.230
By being seldom seen, I couldnot stir

301
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.400
but like a comet I was wonder'dat,

302
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.730
that men would tell theirchildren, "This is he."

303
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:53.930
Others would say, "Where? Whichis Bolingbroke?"

304
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:58.330
And then I stole all courtesyfrom heaven

305
00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.300
and dress'd myself in suchhumility

306
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.770
that I did pluck allegiance frommen's hearts,

307
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.430
loud shouts and salutations fromtheir mouths,

308
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.970
even in the presence of thecrowned king.

309
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:19.600
Thus did I keep my person freshand new.

310
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.800
My presence, like a robepontifical,

311
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.470
ne'er seen but wonder'd at.

312
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:32.300
And so my state, seldom butsumptuous,

313
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:37.770
showed like a feast and won byrareness such solemnity.

314
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:46.300
The skipping king, he ambled upand down

315
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:50.230
with shallow jesters and rashbavin wits,

316
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.100
soon kindled and soon burnt.

317
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.770
Carded his state,

318
00:16:55.770 --> 00:17:00.070
mingled his royalty withcapering fools,

319
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:04.070
had his great name profaned withtheir scorns,

320
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:07.470
and gave his countenance,against his name,

321
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.930
to laugh at gibing boys andstand the push

322
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.670
of every beardless vaincomparative,

323
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:19.770
grew a companion to the commonstreets,

324
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.800
enfeoff'd himself to popularity

325
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.900
that, being daily swallow'd bymen's eyes,

326
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.630
they surfeited with honey andbegan to loathe

327
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.130
the taste of sweetness,

328
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.600
whereof a little more than alittle

329
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.500
is by much too much.

330
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.970
So when he had occasion to beseen,

331
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.530
he was but as the cuckoo is inJune:

332
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:52.600
heard, not regarded; seen, butwith such eyes

333
00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.370
as, sick and blunted withcommunity,

334
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.730
afford no extraordinary gaze,

335
00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.370
such as is bent on sun-likemajesty

336
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:05.000
when it shines seldom inadmiring eyes,

337
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.530
but rather drowzed and hungtheir eyelids down,

338
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:15.730
slept in his face, and render'dsuch aspect

339
00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.370
as cloudy men use to theiradversaries,

340
00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:23.200
being with his presence glutted,gorged, and full.

341
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:29.970
And in that very line, Harry,standest thou,

342
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.930
for thou has lost thy princelyprivilege

343
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.870
with vile participation.

344
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:42.600
Not an eye But is a-weary of thycommon sight, save mine,

345
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.370
which hath desired to see theemore,

346
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.030
which now doth that I would nothave it do:

347
00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:53.800
make blind itself with foolishtenderness.

348
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.700
I shall hereafter, my thricegracious lord,

349
00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.130
be more myself.

350
00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.430
For all the world as thou art tothis hour

351
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:04.800
was Richard then,

352
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.470
when I from France set foot atRavenspurgh.

353
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:14.970
And even as I was then is Percynow.

354
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:19.200
Now, by my scepter and my soulto boot,

355
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.470
he hath more worthy interest tothe state

356
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.970
than thou the shadow ofsuccession,

357
00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:29.500
for of no right, nor color liketo right,

358

359
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.430
turns head against the lion'sarmed jaws,

360
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:40.500
and, being no more in debt toyears than thou,

361
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.800
leads ancient lords and reverendbishops on

362
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.430
to bloody battles and tobruising arms.

363
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:52.300
What never-dying honor hath hegot

364
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.800
against renowned Douglas, whosehigh deeds,

365
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.830

366
00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:03.470
holds from all soldiers chiefmajority

367
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.530
and military title capital

368
00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:09.270
through all the kingdoms thatacknowledge Christ.

369
00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.730
And what say you to this?

370
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:21.630
Percy, Northumberland, theArchbishop's grace of York,

371
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.400
Douglas, Mortimer,

372
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.670
capitulate against us and areup.

373
00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:32.330
But wherefore do I tell thee ofthose news?

374
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:36.700
Why, Harry, do I tell thee of myfoes,

375
00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.630
which art my near'st and dearestenemy?

376
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:44.930
Thou that art like enough,through vassal fear,

377
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:48.130
base inclination, and the startof spleen

378
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.400
to fight against me underPercy's pay,

379
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.030
to dog his heelsand curtsy athis frowns,

380
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.770
to show how much thou artdegenerate!

381
00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.130
Do not think so.

382
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.900
You shall not find it so.

383
00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.300
And God forgive them that somuch have sway'd

384
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.970
your majesty's good thoughtsaway from me.

385
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:10.870
I will redeem all this onPercy's head

386
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.470
and, in the closing of someglorious day,

387
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:17.100
be bold to tell you that I amyour son,

388
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.970
when I will wear a garment allof blood

389
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:22.100
and stain my favors in a bloodymask,

390
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.300
which, wash'd away, shall scourmy shame with it.

391
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.770
And that shall be the day,whene'er it lights,

392
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.000
that this same child of honorand renown,

393
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.830
this gallant Hotspur, thisall-praised knight

394
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:40.230
and your unthought-of Harrychance to meet.

395
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.000
For every honor sitting on hishelm,

396
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.330
would they were multitudes

397
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.500
and on my head my shamesredoubled.

398
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.630
For the time will come

399
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.470
that I shall make this northernyouth

400
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.900
exchange his glorious deeds formy indignities.

401
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.970
Percy is but my factor, good mylord,

402
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:03.130
to engross up glorious deeds onmy behalf.

403
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.170
And I will call him to so strictaccount

404
00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.330
that he shall render every gloryup--

405
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.000
yea, even the slightest worshipof his time--

406
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.900
or I will tear the reckoningfrom his heart.

407
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:20.470
This, in the name of God, Ipromise here,

408
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.300
the which if he be pleased, Ishall perform,

409
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.870
I do beseech your majesty maysalve

410
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:31.170
the long-grown wounds of myintemperture.

411
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:36.500
If not, the end of life cancelsall bands,

412
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:40.930
and I will die a hundredthousand deaths

413
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.000
ere break the smallest parcel ofthis vow.

414
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:54.630
A hundred thousand rebels die inthis,

415
00:22:54.630 --> 00:23:02.000
thou shalt have charge andsovereign trust herein.

416
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:21.900
Oh, Bardolph.

417
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.300
Huh?

418
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.070
Am I not fallen away vilelysince this last action?

419
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.900
Do I not bate?

420
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.330
Do I not dwindle?

421
00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.730
My skin hangs about me

422
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:36.400
like an like an old lady's loosegown.

423
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.930
I am withered like an oldapple-john.

424
00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.700
Well, I'll repent, and thatsuddenly,

425
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.900
while I'm in some liking.

426
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.330
I shall be out of heart shortly,

427
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.200
and then I shall have nostrength to repent.

428
00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:55.900
An I've not forgotten what theinside of a church is made of.

429
00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.100
I'm a peppercorn, a brewer'shorse.

430
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:02.570
The inside of a church.

431
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:07.100
Company, villainous company,hath been the spoil of me.

432
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:13.330
Sir John, you are so fretful,you cannot live long.

433
00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:14.670
Why, there is it.

434
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:16.300
Come sing me a bawdy song.

435
00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.330
Make me merry.

436
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:18.330
Oh--

437
00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:19.800
Oh, no, it's--

438
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.530
I've been as virtuously given asa gentleman need to be,

439
00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:23.900
virtuous enough.

440
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.670
Swore little, diced not aboveseven times a week,

441
00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:31.130
went to a bawdy-house not aboveonce in a quarter...

442
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.100
of an hour,

443
00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:37.430
paid money that I borrowed threeor four times,

444
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.600
lived well and in good compass.

445
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.900
And now I live out of all order,out of all compass.

446
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.830
You are so fat, Sir John,

447
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.970
you must needs be out of allcompass,

448
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.570
out of all reasonable...

449
00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.000
compass, Sir John.

450
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.770
Do thou amend thy face, and I'llamend my life.

451
00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.170
Thou art our admiral.

452
00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.370
Thou bearest the lantern in thepoop,

453
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.800
but 'tis in the nose of thee.

454
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.970
Thou art the Knight of theBurning Lamp.

455
00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:14.730
Why, Sir John, my face does youno harm.

456
00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:15.830
No, I'll be sworn.

457
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.570
I make as good use of it as manya man doth

458
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:19.530
of a Death's-head or a mementomori.

459
00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.530
I never see thy face but I thinkof hell-fire

460
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.800
and Dives that lived in purple,

461
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.870
for there he is in his robes,burning, burning.

462
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:32.770
Oh, thou art a perpetualtriumph,

463
00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.930
an everlasting bonfire-light.

464
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:37.470
Thou hast saved me a thousandmarks

465
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:40.800
in links and torches, walkingwith thee

466
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.900
in the night betwixt tavern andtavern.

467
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.930
But the sack that thou hastdrunk me

468
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.600
would have bought me lights asgood cheap

469
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.630
at the dearest chandler's inEurope.

470
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.570
I have maintained thatsalamander of yours

471
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.570
with fire any time this two andthirty years.

472
00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:56.800
God reward me for it.

473
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.970
'Sblood, I would my face were inyour belly!

474
00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:01.200
God-a-mercy!

475
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.400
So should I be sure to beheart-burned.

476
00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:12.930
How now, Dame Partlet the hen.

477
00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:16.330
Have you inquired yet who pickedmy pocket?

478
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.630
Why, what do you think, SirJohn?

479
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:21.100
Do you think I keep thieves inmy house?

480
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.230
I have searched.

481
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.400
I have inquired

482
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.030
man by man, boy by boy, servantby servant.

483
00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.270
The tithe of a hair was neverlost in my house before.

484
00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:29.500
Ye lie, hostess.

485
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.900
Bardolph was shaved and lostmany a hair.

486
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.330
And I'll be sworn my pocket waspicked.

487
00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.030
Go to. You're a woman; go.

488
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.030
Who, I?

489
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.130
No, I defy thee.

490
00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.630
God's light, I was never calledso

491
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:40.730
in mine own house before.

492
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:42.470
Go to. I know you well enough.

493
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.100
No, Sir John.

494
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.030
You do not know me, Sir John.

495
00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.230
I know you, Sir John.

496
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.170
You owe me money, Sir John,

497
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.770
and now you pick a quarrel tobeguile me of it.

498
00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.100
I bought you a dozen of shirtsto your back.

499
00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.230
Dowlas, filthy dowlas.

500
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.000
I gave them away to bakers'wives,

501
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.570
and they have made bolters ofthem.

502
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:00.700
Oh!

503
00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.630
Now, as I'm a true woman,

504
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:05.670
holland of eight shillings anell.

505
00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:07.570
You owe money here besides, SirJohn,

506
00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.930
for your diet and by-drinkingsand money lent you,

507
00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.100
four and twenty pound.

508
00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.770
He had his share of it; let himpay.

509
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:14.800
He?

510
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.730
Alas, he's poor. He has nothing.

511
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.330
How, poor?

512
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.600
Look at his face; what call yourich?

513
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.770
Let them coin his nose.

514
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:24.200
Let them coin his cheeks.

515
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.270
I'll not pay a denier.

516
00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:27.130
What, will you make a younker ofme?

517
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:28.770
Shall I not take mine ease inmine inn

518
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:30.470
but I shall have my pocketpicked?

519
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.870
I have lost a seal-ring of mygrandfather's

520
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:34.000
was worth forty mark.

521
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.300
Jesu, I have heard the princetell him,

522
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.030
I know not how oft, that thatring was copper!

523
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:40.130
How?

524
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:42.200
The prince is a Jack, asneak-cup.

525
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.600
'Sblood, an he were here, I'dcudgel him like a dog

526
00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.130
if he should say so.

527
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:48.700
How now, lad.

528
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.200
Is the wind in that door, i'faith?

529
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.300
Must we all march?

530
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.730
Ay, two and two, Newgatefashion.

531
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:56.870
My lord, will you hear me?

532
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:59.500
Let her alone, and list to me.

533
00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.600
What sayest thou, Jack?

534
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.200
The other night, I fell asleephere

535
00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.130
behind the arras and had mypocket picked.

536
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:05.700
This house is turnedbawdy-house.

537
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.700
They pick pockets.

538
00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:07.900
What didst thou lose, Jack?

539
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.030
Wilt thou believe it, Hal?

540
00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.000
Three or four bonds worth fortypound apiece

541
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.730
and a seal-ring of mygrandfather's.

542
00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:14.400
A trifle, some eight-pennymatter.

543
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.570
So I told him, my lord,

544
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.330
and I said that I heard yourgrace say so.

545
00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.670
And, my lord, he speaks mostvilely of you,

546
00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.400
like a foul-mouthed man as heis,

547
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.700
and said he would cudgel you.

548
00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:23.730
What?

549
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:25.200
He did not.

550
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.670
There's neither faith, truth,nor womanhood in me else.

551
00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:30.030
There's no more faith in theethan in a stewed prune.

552
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.770
Go, you thing, go.

553
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.270
Say, what thing?

554
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:34.270
What thing?

555
00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:35.270
What thing?

556
00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.230
Well, a thing to thank God on.

557
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.400
Oh, I'm no thing to thank Godon.

558
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.800
And, setting thy knighthoodaside,

559
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.270
thou art a knave to say so.

560
00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.600
Setting thy womanhood aside,

561
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.170
thou art a beast to sayotherwise.

562
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:48.670
Say, what beast, thou knave,thou?

563
00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:50.330
What beast? Why, an otter.

564
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.870
Oh!

565
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:52.970
An otter, Sir John?

566
00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:54.370
Why an otter?

567
00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:57.130
Well, because she's neither fishnor flesh,

568
00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:59.170
and a man knows not where tohave her.

569
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:02.570
Thou art an unjust man to sayso.

570
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:06.970
Thou or any man know where tohave me!

571
00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.670
Thou knave, thou!

572
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.400
Thou sayest true, hostess,

573
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.430
and he slanders thee mostgrossly.

574
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:14.800
Charge an honest woman withpicking thy pocket?

575
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:19.200
Why, thou whoreson, impudent,embossed rascal.

576
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.830
If there were anything in thypocket

577
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:25.770
but tavern-reckonings,memorandums of bawdy-houses,

578
00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:29.170
and one poor penny-worth ofsugar-candy

579
00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:32.270
to make thee long-winded, if thypockets were enriched

580
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.770
with any other injuries butthese, I am a villain.

581
00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:40.400
You will confess then, that youpicked my pocket?

582
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.470
It appears so by the story.

583
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:43.670
Hostess, I forgive thee.

584
00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.570
Go, make ready breakfast.

585
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.600
Cherish thy servants, and lookto thy guests.

586
00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.800
Nay, prithee, be gone.

587
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.130
Now Hal, to the news at court.

588
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.070
For the robbery, lad, how isthat answered?

589
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:55.830
Oh, my sweet beef, I must stillbe good angel to thee.

590
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:57.800
The money is paid back again.

591
00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.530
Oh, I like not that paying back.

592
00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:01.300
'Tis a double labor.

593
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.930
I'm good friends with my fatherand may do any thing.

594
00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:06.070
Rob me the exchequer the firstthing thou doest.

595
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.200
Do, my lord.

596
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.800
I have procured thee, Jack, acharge...

597
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.330
of foot.

598
00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.100
-Bardolph! -My lord?

599
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.170
Go bear this letter to Lord Johnof Lancaster,

600
00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.470
to my brother John, this to myLord of Westmoreland.

601
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:20.300
Jack, meet me tomorrow in thetemple hall

602
00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.770
at two o'clock in the afternoon.

603
00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.130
There shalt thy know thy charge,

604
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:27.700
and there receive money andorder for their furniture.

605
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.600
The land is burning,

606
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.500
Percy stands on high,

607
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.070
and either we or they must lowerlie.

608
00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.100
Rare words.

609
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.930
Brave world.

610
00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.130
Hostess, my breakfast.

611
00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:52.070
Come.

612
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:57.770
Oh, I could wish this tavernwere my drum.

613
00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:01.230
Well said, my noble Scot.

614
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:02.970
If speaking truth in this fineage

615
00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:04.200
were not thought flattery,

616
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.130
such attribution should theDouglas have,

617
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:07.870
as not a soldier of thisseason's stamp

618
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.970
should go so general currentthrough the world.

619
00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:12.330
By God, I cannot flatter.

620
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.400
I do defy the tongues ofsoothers.

621
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.130
But a braver place in my heart'slove

622
00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:17.600
hath no man than yourself.

623
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.900
Nay, task me to my word.

624
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.170
Approve me, lord.

625
00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:24.170
Thou art the king of honor.

626
00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.630
No man more potent breathes uponthe ground

627
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:29.630
but I will beard him.

628
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:30.630
Do so, and 'tis well.

629
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.030
What letters hast thou there?

630
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.600
I can but thank you.

631
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.270
These letters come from yourfather.

632
00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.300
Letters from him?

633
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.470
Why comes he not himself?

634
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:41.670
He cannot come, my lord; he isgrievous sick.

635
00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.500
'Zounds, how has he the leisureto be sick

636
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.070
in such a justling time?

637
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:46.330
Who leads his power?

638
00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:48.700
Under whose government come theyalong?

639
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.770
His letters bear his mind, mylord, not I.

640
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.930
I prithee, tell me, doth he keephis bed?

641
00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:57.230
He did, my lord, four days ere Iset forth.

642
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:59.030
And at the time of my departurethence,

643
00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.370
he was much fear'd by hisphysicians.

644
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:03.770
I would the state of time hadfirst been whole

645
00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:05.830
ere he by sickness had beenvisited.

646
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.070
His health was never betterworth than now.

647
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:09.470
Sick now.

648
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:12.100
Droop now?

649
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.370
This sickness doth infect thevery life-blood

650
00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:15.630
of our enterprise.

651
00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.600
'Tis catching hither, even toour camp.

652
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.930
He writes me here that inwardsickness--

653
00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:24.870
and that his friends could notby deputation

654
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:29.330
so soon be drawn, nor did hethink it meet

655
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:31.230
to lay so dangerous and dear atrust

656
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:33.270
on any soul removed but on hisown.

657
00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:35.000
Yet doth he give us boldadvertisement

658
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.100
that with our small conjunctionwe should on

659
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.730
to see how fortune is disposedto us,

660
00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:45.930
for, as he writes, there is noquailing now.

661
00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:48.970
Because the king is certainlypossess'd

662
00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:51.270
of all our purposes.

663
00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:55.030
What say you to it?

664
00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:00.630
Your father's sickness is a maimto us.

665
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:05.270
A perilous gash, a very limblopp'd off.

666
00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:08.830
And yet, in faith, it is not.

667
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:12.900
I rather of his absence makethis use.

668
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.930
It lends a luster and more greatopinion,

669
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.170
a larger dare to our greatenterprise

670
00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:19.300
than if the earl were here, formen must think,

671
00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.930
if we without his help can makea head

672
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:22.770
to push against a kingdom, withhis help,

673
00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:24.570
we can o'erturn it topsy-turvydown.

674
00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:25.930
Yet all goes well.

675
00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:27.200
Yet all our joints are whole.

676
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.730
As heart can think.

677
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:30.900
There's not a word spoke of inScotland

678
00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.870
as this term of fear.

679
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:36.470
My cousin Vernon, welcome, by mysoul.

680
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:38.300
Pray God my news be worth awelcome, lord.

681
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.530
The Earl of Westmoreland, seventhousand strong,

682
00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:42.730
is marching hitherwards; withhim, Prince John.

683
00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:43.970
No harm. What more?

684
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:45.230
And further, I have learn'd,

685
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:47.000
the king himself in person isset forth,

686
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.970
or hitherwards intendedspeedily,

687
00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:50.670
with strong and mightypreparation.

688
00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:51.700
He shall be welcome too.

689
00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:52.900
Where is his son,

690
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:58.230
the nimble-footed madcap Princeof Wales,

691
00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:00.500
and his comrades that daff'd theworld aside

692
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.970
and bid it pass?

693
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:07.130
All furnish'd, all in arms, allplumed like estridges

694
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.900
that with the wind baited likeeagles having lately bathed,

695
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.870
glittering in golden coats likeimages,

696
00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:14.830
as full of spirit as the monthof May

697
00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:16.830
and gorgeous as the sun atmidsummer

698
00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:21.400
wanton as youthful goats, wildas young bulls.

699
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.770
I saw young Harry with hisbeaver on,

700
00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:26.630
his cuisses on his thighs,gallantly arm'd

701
00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.900
rise from the ground likefeather'd Mercury

702
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.830
and vaulted with such ease intohis seat

703
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.300
as if an angel dropp'd down fromthe clouds

704
00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.770
to turn and wind a fiery Pegasus

705
00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:38.570
and witch the world with noblehorsemanship.

706
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.530
No more, no more.

707
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:44.870
Worse than the sun in March,this praise doth nourish agues.

708
00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:47.330
Let them come.

709
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:50.330
They come like sacrifices intheir trim.

710
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:53.130
And to the fire-eyed maid ofsmoky war,

711
00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:55.000
all hot and bleeding, shall weoffer them.

712
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.300
The mailed Mars shall on hisaltar sit

713
00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.200
up to the ears in blood.

714
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.700
I am on fire to hear this richreprisal is so nigh

715
00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.670
and yet not ours.

716
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.830
Come; let me taste my horse,

717
00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:07.430
who is to bear me like athunderbolt

718
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:09.700
against the bosom of the Princeof Wales.

719
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.970
Harry to Harry shall, hot horseto horse,

720
00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:16.130
meet and ne'er part till onedrop down a corse.

721
00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:18.370
O that Glendower were come!

722
00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:19.430
There is more news.

723
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:21.900
I learn'd in Worcester, as Irode along,

724
00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.630
he cannot draw his power thisfourteen days.

725
00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:28.600
These are the worst tidings Ihear of yet.

726
00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.700
Ay, my faith, that bears afrosty sound.

727
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.700
What may the king's whole battlereach unto?

728
00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.470
To thirty thousand.

729
00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.000
Forty, let it be.

730
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.400
My father and Glendower beingboth away,

731
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.530
the powers of us may serve sogreat a day.

732
00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:57.170
Come; let us take a musterspeedily.

733
00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:02.570
Doomsday is near.

734
00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:04.970
Die all.

735
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:06.270
Die merrily.

736
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:07.570
Talk not of dying.

737
00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:10.900
I'm out of fear of death ordeath's hand

738
00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.730
this one-half year.

739
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:25.870
Bardolph, get thee before toCoventry.

740
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:28.370
Fill me a bottle of sack.

741
00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:29.930
Our soldiers shall marchthrough.

742
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:32.270
We'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.

743
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:38.800
Bardolph, bid my lieutenant Petomeet me at the town's end.

744
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.630
Will you give me money,captain?

745
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.230
Lay out. Lay out.

746
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:45.330
This bottle makes an angel.

747
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:47.200
An if it do, take it for thylabor.

748
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.000
And if it make twenty, take themall.

749
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.100
I'll answer the coinage.

750
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.370
I will, captain. Farewell!

751
00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:54.200
Farewell.

752
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.500
If I be not ashamed of mysoldiers,

753
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.370
I'm a soused gurnet.

754
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:10.930
I have misused the king's pressdamnably.

755
00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:14.430
I have got, in exchange of ahundred and fifty soldiers,

756
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:19.430
three hundred and odd pound.

757
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:21.200
I press me none but goodhouse-holders,

758
00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.830
yeoman's sons,

759
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.300
inquire me out contractedbachelors

760
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:28.000
such as had been asked twice onthe banns,

761
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.170
such a commodity of warm slaves

762
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:32.430
as had as lieve hear the devilas a drum,

763
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:35.070
such as fear the report of acaliver worse

764
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.970
than a struck fowl or a hurtwild-duck.

765
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:41.570
I pressed me none but suchtoasts-and-butter,

766
00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.330
with hearts in their bellies nobigger than pins' heads,

767
00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.470
and they...

768
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:50.670
have bought out their services.

769
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.470
And now my whole charge consists

770
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.770
of discarded unjust serving-men,

771
00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.870
the younger sons of youngerbrothers,

772
00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:02.070
revolted tapsters and ostlerstrade-fallen,

773
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:05.870
the cankers of a calm world anda long peace.

774
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:07.600
Such have I, to fill up therooms of them

775
00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.270
that have bought out theirservices,

776
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:10.600
that you'd think that I had

777
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.300
a hundred and fifty tatteredprodigals lately come

778
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:17.570
from swine-keeping, from eatingdraff and husks.

779
00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:22.370
A mad fellow met me on the wayand told me

780
00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:26.330
I had unloaded all the gibbetsand pressed the dead bodies.

781
00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:29.870
No eye hath seen suchscarecrows.

782
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:33.400
I'll not march through Coventrywith them; that's flat.

783
00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.430
How now, blown Jack!

784
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:37.500
What, Hal!

785
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:40.630
How now, mad wag!

786
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:42.400
What a devil dost thou inWarwickshire?

787
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.570
My Lord of Westmoreland, I cryyour honor mercy.

788
00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:46.630
I thought you had already beenat Shrewsbury.

789
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.300
In faith, Sir John,

790
00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.970
'tis more than time that I werethere, and you too.

791
00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:52.630
But my powers are there already.

792
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.900
The king, I can tell you, looksfor us all.

793
00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.000
We must away all night.

794
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.230
Tut, man, never fear me.

795
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:58.970
I'm as vigilant as a cat tosteal cream.

796
00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:00.330
I think to steal cream indeed,

797
00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:02.300
for thy theft hath already madethee butter.

798
00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:06.870
But tell me, Jack, whose fellowsare these?

799
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:08.430
Mine, Hal, mine.

800
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.500
I did never see, such pitifulrascals.

801
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.530
Oh, tut, tut, man.

802
00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:12.570
Good enough to toss.

803
00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:15.470
Food for powder. Food forpowder.

804
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:17.900
Well, they'll fill a pits aswell as better.

805
00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.000
Tush, man, mortal men, mortalmen.

806
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.930
Ay, but, Sir John, methinks theyare

807
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:25.330
exceeding poor and bare, toobeggarly.

808
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:28.600
'Faith, for their poverty, Iknow not how they came by that.

809
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.870
And for their bareness,

810
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:31.600
I'm sure they never learned thatof me.

811
00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.900
No, I'll be sworn,

812
00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.470
unless you call three fingers inthe ribs bare.

813
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:37.170
Sirrah, make haste.

814
00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:38.570
Percy is already in the field!

815
00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:40.170
What, is the king encamped?

816
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.200
He is, Sir John.

817
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.470
I fear we shall stay too long!

818
00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:57.530
Well, to the latter end of afray

819
00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:01.170
and the beginning of a feast

820
00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:05.730
fits a dull fighter and a keenguest.

821
00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.900
