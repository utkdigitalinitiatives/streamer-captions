00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.760

        That should be more evident.


00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.680

        It should be bit more like
        what you just struck now.
      

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.140

        We're so excited to play a
        piece which, to our to
      

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.950

        knowledge hasn't been played
        since probably, a few years
      

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.320

        after you wrote it.


00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.390

        It's a new discovery.


00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.710

        It seems so alive, especially,
        amazingly, when you consider
      

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.470

        that it's been sitting in
        a box, in the Library of
      

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.870

        Congress for over 60 years.


00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.350

        It's just recently
        been discovered.
      

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.920

        We were so excited.


00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.240

        Seems to me to be quite a
        test. 60 years in a box.
      

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.140

        And the thing's still alive.


00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.480

        Maybe we can play it
        again for you now.
      

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.450

        Please do.


00:01:12.450 --> 00:02:15.800

        [MUSIC PLAYING]


00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:27.180

        I was born in Brooklyn
        on November 14, 1900.
      

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.040

        I was the youngest
        of five children.
      

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.940

        And we live above a large
        department store, on the
      

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.890

        corner of Washington Avenue
        and Dean Street.
      

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.320

        My earliest musical memories are
        concerned, I suppose, with
      

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.760

        my hanging around my older
        sister while she was
      

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.630

        practicing her scales.


00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.130

        And she would, after awhile,
        look at me down there, and
      

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.590

        say, Aaron, why are you
        hanging around here?
      

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.890

        Why don't you go outside and
        play with the other kids?
      

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.920

        I didn't know what was
        fascinating me.
      

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.100

        I couldn't have explained it.


00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.830

        But something about the sound
        of music just drew my
      

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.030

        attention in such a way that I
        wasn't willing to give up.
      

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.450

        And gradually she realized
        I was particularly
      

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.250

        interested in music.


00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.950

        She began giving me
        piano lessons.
      

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.590

        When his sister had taught him
        all she knew, he asked his
      

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.700

        parents for lessons with a
        professional piano teacher.
      

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.790

        There was a certain resistance
        there though, I remember,
      

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.880

        because my father said after all
        we've spent so much money
      

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.670

        on the older kids lessons in
        music, and look how little has
      

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.230

        come of it.


00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.370

        I don't want to waste any
        more money on you.
      

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.370

        But I was persistent.


00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.010

        And he gave in finally.


00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.540

        Gradually, I found myself not
        only practicing what I was
      

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.220

        supposed to practice at the
        piano, but making up of tunes
      

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.430

        of my own and having difficulty
        in knowing what
      

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.510

        sort of harmonies ought
        to go with the tunes.
      

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.100

        And finally I decided, I
        must have a teacher.
      

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.090

        So he began traveling from
        Brooklyn when he was 17, to
      

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.090

        study with Rubin Goldmark who
        impressed Aaron, because he
      

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.020

        lived in Manhattan.


00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.520

        He really knew his stuff.


00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.290

        And so, for the four years
        that I spent with him, I
      

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.220

        really learned the fundamentals
        of harmony and
      

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.470

        counterpoint, and the form
        and composition.
      

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.210

        I owe him a lot in that sense.


00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.090

        But Goldmark was a traditional
        musician, and Aaron was
      

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.570

        already showing signs of needing
        to break free of
      

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.140

        conventional musical ideas.


00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.440

        I had a little trouble with him,
        because I was beginning
      

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.960

        to write pieces that from where
        he sat, seemed rather
      

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.950

        avant-garde, and he couldn't
        apply any of his conventional
      

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.290

        harmonic ideas to them, because
        they didn't have any
      

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.680

        conventional ideas
        in that sense.
      

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.600

        So after four years
        with Goldmark,
      

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.450

        Aaron headed for France.


00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.090

        The newer music seemed to
        be coming from Paris.
      

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.700

        Debussy and Ravel were the
        hottest things around in those
      

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.810

        days, and especially the fact
        that Igor Stravinsky was
      

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.450

        alive, and living, and
        working in Paris.
      

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.730

        That was a big draw.


00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.940

        The French decided to establish
        a music school for
      

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.930

        American students, a summer
        music school, in the palace of
      

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.290

        Fontainbleau.


00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.250

        When I learned about that, of
        course, I jumped at the idea
      

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.490

        since it meant that I would
        spend my first two months in
      

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.750

        Europe with a bunch of
        fellow Americans.
      

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.150

        At the end of the two month
        school, they decided they'd
      

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.740

        give a public concert
        in Paris.
      

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.870

        I believe I played two early
        piano pieces, one a Pasicalia,
      

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.560

        and the other was a piano
        piece called,
      

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.120

        "The Cat and the Mouse".


00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.370

        ["THE CAT AND THE MOUSE,"
        MUSIC PLAYING]
      

00:05:44.370 --> 00:06:20.670



00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.970

        After the concert, in the
        green room, to my great
      

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.490

        surprise and pleasure, Monsieur
        Durand of the famous
      

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.190

        French publishers, Durand and
        Company came up to me and
      

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.280

        said, is that work of
        yours published?
      

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.630

        I said no.


00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.880

        He said, well, come and see me
        in my office, and perhaps,
      

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.510

        we'd like to publish it.


00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.040

        So I went to see him
        in his office.
      

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.140

        And he said, yes, definitely we
        would like to publish it.
      

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.250

        Here's a check for
        so many francs.
      

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.280

        It was about the equivalent
        of $25 or, at most, $50.
      

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.650

        I can't remember exactly.


00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:51.720

        Here's a check.


00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.720

        And just sign here.


00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.840

        So I would have given him
        the piece for nothing.
      

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.570

        I was so delighted to be
        published, especially by
      

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.640

        Debussy's and Ravel's publisher,
        so I signed a piece
      

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.830

        of paper, and, by golly, I
        sell the whole, complete
      

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.820

        rights forever, about the
        equivalent of $50.
      

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.330

        My friend, Harold
        [UNINTELLIGIBLE], says it's
      

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.220

        the only business mistake
        I ever made.
      

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.940



00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.190

        Paris was the place to
        be in the '20s, so
      

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.380

        they were all there.


00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.960

        Joyce, Hemingway, Fitzgerald,
        the writers, as well as the
      

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.520

        composers and painters, could
        be seen in the cafes and
      

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.580

        bookstores.


00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.250

        Although too young and green to
        be part of the Paris in the
      

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.580

        '20s set, Copland and his cousin
        Harold Clurman, who
      

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.640

        would become the distinguished
        theater director, suddenly
      

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.420

        found themselves in this
        extraordinary center.
      

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.290

        While at Fountainbleau, Aaron
        had met the young woman who
      

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.800

        would become his teacher.


00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.920

        Fellow students started to talk
        to me about a teacher of
      

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.460

        harmony called Nadia Boulanger,
        and urging me to
      

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.430

        visit her class.


00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.380

        And I said, no.


00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.040

        I'm not visiting any
        harmony classes.
      

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.040

        I've had three years
        of harmony.
      

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.560

        Don't want to hear anything
        more about harmony.
      

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.280

        They said, no, no.


00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.990

        Just go and see the
        way she does it.
      

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.140

        So I was very taken with her.


00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.470

        And very gradually, I began to
        think I would like to study
      

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.890

        with Nadia Boulanger.


00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.670

        But I hesitated.


00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.170

        Because I couldn't think, in the
        whole history of music, of
      

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.260

        any well known famous composer
        would had ever studied with a
      

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.080

        woman teacher.


00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.180

        Nadia Boulanger would become
        the single most important
      

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.300

        composition teacher
        of the century.
      

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.000

        Her influence was enormous as
        generation after generation of
      

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.050

        young musicians flocked to her
        studio to study with this
      

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.040

        exceptional woman.


00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.580

        She was really a remarkable
        personality and an
      

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.300

        extraordinary musician.


00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.800

        She knew everything about music
        you would want to know.
      

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.090

        The oldest music.


00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.720

        The newest music.


00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.440

        A studio was not just a place
        where we studied with her.
      

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.310

        It was a kind of a musical
        center of Paris.
      

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.390

        She had her Wednesday afternoon


00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.960

        classes for her students.


00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.060

        And after the class was over,
        all the musical great of Paris
      

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.660

        came for tea.


00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.340

        I met Stravinsky there.


00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.090

        And I met [? Pulak ?]


00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.320

        and [? Mio ?], all the
        younger composers.
      

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.570

        I even shook hands with
        [? Sansons ?]
      

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.550

        in that place.


00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.370

        She really launched
        me on my way.
      

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:19.540

        I mean, when it was announced
        in the French papers that
      

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.400

        Serge Koussevitzky, a Russian
        conductor living in Paris, was
      

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.550

        named the new head of the Boston
        Symphony, she said, we
      

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.260

        must go and visit him.


00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:36.620

        And the end of our visit, he
        astonished me by saying you--
      

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.250

        pointing to me--


00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:42.700

        will write a symphony for organ
        and orchestra, and she--
      

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.750

        Mademoiselle Boulanger--


00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.360

        will come and play the
        organ part, as
      

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.830

        soloist, with the orchestra.


00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.670

        Well, when we left his
        apartment, I said to Nadia, do
      

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.300

        you really think
        I could do it?
      

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.350

        You know, I had never heard a
        note of my own orchestration.
      

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.020

        I had never written a piece
        that lasted half an hour
      

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.800

        without pause.


00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.000

        And she sort of shook her
        finger at me, and
      

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.470

        said, you can do it.


00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.990

        When Nadia Boulanger said you
        can do it, that was the end of
      

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.620

        the discussion.


00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.980

        You could do it.


00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.630

        The "Symphony for Organ and
        Orchestra" signaled Aaron's
      

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.930

        return to the United States.


00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:22.150

        I must say, I've never had the
        instincts of an ex-patriot.
      

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:26.140

        I was in Paris in order get
        what I wanted to get.
      

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.060

        And when I had three years of
        it, I decided that was enough.
      

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:33.040

        And the fact that in America,
        our popular composers had been
      

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.680

        able to develop a style of music
        that the whole world
      

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.790

        recognizes, specifically
        American, made me think, now
      

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.550

        why can't we do that
        in the field of
      

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.160

        serious concert music?


00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.140

        Copland was unknown when
        he returned to New
      

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.090

        York City in 1924.


00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.330

        But the "Symphony for Organ
        and Orchestra" caused a
      

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.820

        sensation when it was premiered
        early in 1925.
      

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.230

        As it happened, the work was
        performed first in New York by
      

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.900

        Walter Damrosch before being
        conducted in Boston by
      

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.030

        Koussevitzky.


00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.700

        I was very anxious to be there
        when they ran through it for
      

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.190

        the very first time.


00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.500

        On that very morning, it snowed
        rather badly and the
      

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.900

        subway train from Brooklyn
        was behind schedule.
      

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.970

        Finally, we got to the
        42nd Street station.
      

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.570

        And, breathlessly, after a two
        block run, I arrived at the
      

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:24.100

        front door, grab the door,
        opened it, and I got a blast
      

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.650

        of my orchestration for
        the very first time.
      

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:32.090

        It sounded so much more glorious
        than I ever imagined
      

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.000

        it was going to sound.


00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.590

        I'll never forget that moment.

        [MUSIC PLAYING]


00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.020

        Mr. Damrosch had a very faithful
        audience, especially
      

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.450

        Sunday afternoon audience.


00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.570

        A lot of elderly ladies
        who just adored him.
      

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:23.640

        And he, undoubtedly, knew in
        advance that my rather
      

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.300

        contemporary harmonies and the
        jazzy rhythms were going to
      

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:33.880

        upset the ladies, so that after
        the first performance,
      

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.770

        he came to start
        the next piece.
      

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.110

        And just before he began, he
        suddenly turned around to the
      

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:43.230

        audience and said, if a young
        man, at the age of 23 can
      

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.950

        write a work like the one you
        just heard, in five years,
      

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.910

        he'll be ready to
        commit murder.
      

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.880

        Well, of course, everybody
        laughed.
      

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.260

        And the paper, the next morning,
        had a headline,
      

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.050

        "Young composer to
        commit murder".

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.600

        The league of composers asked
        me for an orchestral
      

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.230

        composition to be premiered in
        the fall of 1925, under the
      

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.270

        baton of Koussevitzky.


00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.560

        I, myself, became very intrigued
        with the idea of
      

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.850

        writing a work that was
        recognizably American within a
      

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.640

        serious musical idiom.


00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.270

        Latching on to jazz materials,
        I composed a suite in five
      

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:32.020

        parts for chamber orchestra, and
        called it, "Music for the
      

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:41.290

        Theatre."

        which was recognizably
      

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:48.780

        American in quality, although
        it didn't have its origin in
      

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.040

        the '20s, seem to flower
        most importantly then.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.480

        During the teens there had
        been a certain wave of
      

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.640

        interest in using specifically
        American folk songs, or what
      

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.890

        passed for such at that time.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.840

        But not until jazz came along
        did we have a popular American
      

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.870

        music that was completely
        expressive of our era, and at
      

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.890

        the same time, had musical

        Some people in Boston, I
        remember, were rather shocked
      

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:05.100

        at the use of jazz materials in
        a serious work to be played

        his father was in the
      

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:03.350

        Boston Post. "Copland's Latest
        is Poor Stuff." He's been a
      

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.780

        storekeeper long enough
        to know the
      

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.340

        meaning of poor stuff.


00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:10.530

        My father was rather shocked
        by reading the reviews.
      

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:14.950

        He said to me, after all, these
        fellows are paid by The
      

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.480

        New York Times for
        their opinion.
      

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.680

        They must know something
        about music.
      

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.760

        I'd say to him, oh, don't bother
        about what they say.
      

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.090

        Those critics, they're very
        conventional in their tastes.
      

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:26.360

        It's always have
        been that way.
      

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.060

        It always will be that way.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.180

        Copland's piano concerto of
        1926 marked the end of his
      

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.250

        direct use of jazz.

        I have exploited rhythms and

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.940

        point, and I thought,
        well that's it.
      

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.080

        That's the extent of my

        Jazz rhythms would always be

        You certainly can see this piece
        as a way of making a
      

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.080

        powerful, profound,

        underneath it.

        performances of the "Piano

        something very American.

        Leonard Bernstein heard the

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.770

        Actually it was Arther Berger
        who played me--

        --oh, for heaven's sakes.

        --your old record of the "Piano
        Variations." And I
      

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.450

        thought they were about the most
        wonderful series of notes
      

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.230

        I'd ever heard.


00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.650

        And I wanted to learn them,
        but I couldn't afford the
      

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.150

        sheet music.


00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:44.820

        Anyway, at that time, I
        had just turned 19.
      

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.650

        I was a junior at Harvard.


00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:52.880

        And I was playing this piece at
        parties all over the place,
      

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.180

        emptying rooms at parties,
        playing the "Piano

        tricks at the time.

        Wait till you hear this.


00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:05.190

        I had an image of Aaron as a
        kind of a great patriarch,
      

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:08.960

        with a beard, looking something
        like Walt Whitman,
      

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.890

        and of a certain age, and
        fiery, declamatory, old
      

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.590

        testament type, prophet,
        because
      

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.880

        that's all in the music.


00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.880

        And what was my amazement when
        I met him, quite by accident,
      

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.580

        at Anna Sokolow's
        debut recital.
      

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:30.690

        And next to me, was seated, on
        my right, this 37 year old,
      

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:39.010

        lean, charming, smiling, toothy,
        happy, affable man.
      

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.930

        And when he said, I'm Aaron
        Copland, how do you do?
      

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:44.480

        I fainted.


00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.510

        I revived him.


00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.000

        Former President of the
        Juilliard School and of

        Lincoln Center, Composer
        William Schumann.
      

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:55.440

        I think people, sometimes, have
        misjudged Aaron, because
      

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.390

        he's so affable.


00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:57.770

        He could be very strong.


00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:59.440

        I never knew him to be mean.


00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.010

        And I never known him
        to lose his temper.
      

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:03.950

        Although he could come
        very close to it.
      

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.490

        He's a very controlled person.


00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:08.690

        But he did not suffer fools
        lightly, not at all.
      

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.570

        Composer Ned Rorem.


00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:16.320

        I think it's to belittle him
        to infer that he was a man
      

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.900

        without temperament,
        or lust, in fact.
      

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:24.300

        And I can remember seeing
        Aaron angry.
      

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.220

        I can remember seeing him
        extremely impatient.
      

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.960

        I can remember seeing him sad.


00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.930

        If Aaron Copland is a saint, as
        so many people make you out
      

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.400

        to be, the inference seems to
        be that saints are without
      

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.180

        temptation.


00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:47.770

        But the very definition of a
        saint is a person who has
      

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:49.970

        overcome temptation.


00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:54.420

        He is a man of art
        and sensibility.
      

00:23:54.420 --> 00:24:02.030

        And not immune to the slings
        and arrows of personal
      

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.450

        fortune, as well as professional
        fortune.
      

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.730

        I think that's important
        to be said.
      

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:11.220

        With the "Piano Variations,"
        Copland became the undisputed
      

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.220

        American leader of the musical
        movements of the time.
      

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.590

        He became the leader because his
        interests were so broad.
      

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.990

        And his loft became the
        center in New York for
      

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.930

        composers to meet.


00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:24.380

        I remember going there, with--
        you'd find 15 or 20 composers,
      

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.320

        all around talking about
        the problems of the day
      

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.040

        and about the music.


00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.920

        He was just the center.


00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.230

        David Diamond was one
        of those composers
      

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:33.150

        encouraged by Copland.


00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:35.730

        He was always concerned
        about publication.
      

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.620

        Where would we get our
        music published?
      

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:39.980

        And indeed, it was

        set up for that.
      

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:44.440

        So Aaron had his hand
        in everything.
      

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.110

        And it was always in our behalf,
        really, that he was
      

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.740

        doing things.


00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.150

        It was not for himself.


00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.570

        Composer Jacob Druckman.


00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:56.880

        Aaron is the kind of person
        that goes out and creates
      

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.250

        something that was not there,
        who looks around and sees a
      

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:03.170

        need for something, who invents
        festivals, invents
      

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:06.690

        occasions, invents foundations,
        invents ways to
      

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.410

        help young composers.


00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:12.030

        For example, with Composer Roger
        Sessions he put together
      

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:13.890

        a series of concerts
        devoted to the
      

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:15.940

        music of young composers.


00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:20.570

        He also organized contemporary
        music festivals at Yaddo, the
      

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:22.580

        artist colony in upstate
        New York.
      

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.530



00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:29.950

        Copland's interest in the
        avant-garde extended to early
      

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.240

        experiments in filmmaking.


00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:36.520



00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.300

        He and some other non actor
        friends even appeared in one
      

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.020

        by the photographer
        Rudy Burkhardt.
      

00:25:42.020 --> 00:26:47.120

        [MUSIC PLAYING]


00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.930

        Money was tight and so composing
        had to be fitted
      

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:52.110

        around the lecturing and writing
        activities which
      

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.910

        earned his living.


00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:56.470

        It was difficult living in New
        York City to get to the
      

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:57.850

        necessary calm.


00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:01.680

        I used to like to work in the
        evenings just because the
      

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.760

        telephone tended to stopped
        ringing, and everybody was
      

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.250

        gone out for the evening, if
        they were going any place.
      

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:11.140

        So it was a calm, sort of
        settled down from 8:00 to
      

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:14.340

        12:00, let's say, four hours,
        where I could work
      

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.370

        undisturbed.


00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:18.630

        And I've always tend to be
        a night worker anyhow.
      

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:34.690



00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.980

        In the depression '30s, many
        artists were no longer content
      

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.640

        with a small and highly
        selective audience.
      

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.130

        With the spread of socialism,
        Copland, already frustrated
      

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.330

        that his difficult music was
        not being widely performed,
      

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:50.480

        now wanted to write music
        for a broader public.

        the piece of music which
      

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.140

        would change Copland's
        direction, "El Salon Mexico."

        austerity of the "Piano

        Variations" to the popularity
        of "El Salon Mexico" can be
      

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.510

        explained by the social

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:57.130

        "El Salon Mexico" was written, I
        think, about six years later
      

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:02.230

        then the "Piano Variations."
        The difference in six years
      

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:06.740

        was the difference from 1930,
        the middle of the depression,
      

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:11.530

        the very first years of talking
        pictures, the very

        first years of electric
        phonograph recording, to 1936
      

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:22.250

        or so, which, after all, was the
        time of the coming out of
      

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:22.900

        the depression.


00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:27.950

        It was the election campaign
        for the second term of
      

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:29.570

        Franklin Roosevelt.


00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:34.330

        It was the time of the really
        all encompassing battle
      

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:35.700

        against Hitler.


00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.650

        Copland's revitalized interest
        in music for the people led
      

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:41.670

        him to compose music for
        a variety of uses.
      

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:43.870

        conducted choruses from it

        with the Oratorio Society of
        New York, and the American

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.720

        Copland's most popular music
        was composed for ballet.
      

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:51.540

        Billy the Kid was the first to
        draw on American folk tunes,

        then Appalachian Spring
        and Rodeo.
      

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.980

        Most ballets are born in the
        minds of the choreographer,
      

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.200

        not in the minds
        of a composer.
      

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.520

        And it's a choreographer who
        then goes and tries to find a
      

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.710

        composer who wants to put that
        particular choreographic idea
      

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.040

        into music.

        of Agnes DeMille.
      

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:16.450

        There was no big
        epic premises.
      

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:20.260

        There were no overtones of world
        importance or anything.

        it isn't Hamlet.
      

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.020

        a raucous laugh.

        Just a yelp, and I threw a sofa
        pillow at his head, and I

        think I didn't miss.

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:09.550

        I must say it was


00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:13.280

        unforgettable, for us, certainly.


00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.370

        have been like that.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.840

        I remember that Martha Graham
        made an appointment with me
      

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.220

        and told me she'd love
        to have me write a
      

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.630

        ballet score for her.


00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:10.620

        And then she outlined the
        ballet, what was going to
      

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.200

        happen in it, the
        nature of it.
      

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.340

        But it had no title.


00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:18.980

        I went to Mexico that summer,
        and I worked on the ballet.
      

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.180

        I kept sending her
        back parts of it.
      

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.730

        And finally, I came back and
        stopped off in Washington
      

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:28.090

        where the ballet was
        in rehearsal.
      

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:31.990

        And the first thing I said to
        her was, Martha, what did you
      

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:33.730

        call the ballet?


00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:36.140

        She said, "Appalachian
        Spring." I
      

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:37.170

        said, what a nice name.


00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:38.130

        Where did you get it?


00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:41.800

        She said, well it's the name
        of a poem by Hart Crane.
      

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.440

        I said, well does the poem
        have anything to
      

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.220

        do with your ballet?


00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.080

        She said, no.


00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:49.060

        I just like the title,
        and I used it.
      

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:53.260

        But, I can't tell you how many
        times people have spoke to me
      

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:56.250

        after a performance of
        "Appalachian Spring" and said

        Award for the score.


00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:11.270

        There was a scene where she was
        supposed to be taken very
      

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:13.250

        seriously by the audience.


00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:17.700

        And to the dismay of the
        producer and director of the
      

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.660

        film, when they tried it out,
        as they always do, in some
      

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:24.240

        unknown little theater outside
        Hollywood, the audience
      

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.510

        laughed at her when
        she was stood up.
      

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:29.220

        And the producer came to me, and
        said, Copland, you've got
      

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.760

        to do something to
        save this scene.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:37.700

        So I completely threw out the

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:41.400

        scene, and wrote a much more
        dissonant sounding music than

        would be a normal in

        sound in the house.

        the tense-ness about of the
      

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:45.190

        music that didn't suggest
        anything funny.
      

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:46.440

        And it worked.

        regular university position,
      

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.400

        he loved teaching.

        taught for 25 summers.

        And of course, right in the
        middle of this was Aaron.

        Composer-Conductor Lukas Foss.


00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:47.540

        Aaron was, in his advice to a
        young composer, always very

        functional.


00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:53.420

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.140

        or an idea for a new

        own way, with "Lincoln

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:07.620

        narrated "Lincoln Portrait"

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:11.620

        Abe Lincoln was a quiet
        and a melancholy man.

        But when he spoke of democracy,


00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:19.330

        this is what he said.


00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:23.960

        He said, "As I would not

        about that.

        Nobody could.

        it and lives on.
      

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:35.250

00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:58.040

        In the '50s, many of Copland's
        colleagues returned to a
      

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:00.340

        method of composing
        called Serial-ism.
      

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.700

        He too, felt he wanted to
        use this system again.
      

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:06.650

        It seemed a new way of
        thinking about music.
      

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:09.890

        And it produced chords that
        you wouldn't have thought
      

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:12.220

        about if you're thinking
        tone-ally.
      

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:16.340

        And also, independent lines
        moved in a way that you might
      

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:17.630

        not have thought of
        if you weren't

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.980

        colleagues, and friends.


00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:40.720

        Among them David Walker, his
        longtime assistant, and Vivian
      

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.730

        Perlis, co-author of
        his autobiography.
      

00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:47.890

        At 85, he can look back at
        a lifetime in music.
      

00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:51.900

        I can't imagine how else I would
        have spent my life if
      

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:55.500

        music hadn't existed, because
        I knew right from the time I
      

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:59.360

        was 14 years old, that music
        was going to be my life.
