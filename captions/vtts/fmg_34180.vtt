WEBVTT

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
THIS IS FROM THE
OPENING SEQUENCE OF

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
EISENSTEIN'S FILM
"OCTOBER", MADE TO

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
COMMEMORATE THE RUSSIAN
REVOLUTION OF 1917.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
THE SUCCESSION OF SHOTS,
CUT TOGETHER TO CONTRAST

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
IMAGES AND ANGLES OF
VISION IS CHARACTERISTIC

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
OF THE TECHNIQUE
KNOWN AS "MONTAGE".

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
HERE THE MASSIVE STATUE
OF A FORMER TSAR

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
IS BEING DEMOLISHED.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
THE OLD REGIME IS BROUGHT DOWN
BY THE FORCES OF REVOLUTION.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
THE SYMBOLISM IS EXPLICIT.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:24.000
*

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
THE PURPOSE OF THE FILM
WAS TO CELEBRATE

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY
OF THE REVOLUTION.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
THOUSANDS OF LENINGRAD
FACTORY WORKERS WERE USED

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
IN THE MAKING OF THE
VAST CROWD SCENES

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
AROUND WHICH THE
NARRATIVE IS STRUCTURED.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
THEY ARE THE PEOPLE,
THE PROLETARIAT,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
THE REVOLUTIONARY MASS WHO
ARE THE HEROES OF THE FILM.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
THIS IN ITSELF
IS SIGNIFICANT.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
THE IDEA OF THE CROWD AS
COLLECTIVE HERO WAS IN

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
DIRECT OPPOSITION TO THE
KIND OF INDIVIDUAL HERO

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
TYPICAL OF THE
HOLLYWOOD STAR SYSTEM.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
EISENSTEIN WANTED TO SHOW
THE PUBLIC LIFE OF THE MASS,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
THE COLLECTIVE LIFE
OF THE STREET,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
WHERE THE CITY IS THE
SITE OF REVOLUTION.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
HERE THE REVOLUTIONARY
DEMONSTRATORS ARE BEING

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
FIRED ON BY FORCES OF THE
PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
SUPPORTED BY THE
BOURGEOISIE.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:35.000
*

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
AFTER THE EVENTUAL
VICTORY OF THE BOLSHEVIKS

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
IN OCTOBER 1917, WITH
THE DOWNFALL OF THE

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT,
THE WHOLE STATUS OF "ART"

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
AND ITS PURPOSE WAS
CALLED INTO QUESTION.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
BECAUSE EASEL PAINTING
HAD DEVELOPED UNDER THE

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
DEFEATED CAPITALIST
SYSTEM, IT WAS LINKED

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
TO THE DECADENCE
OF THE BOURGEOISIE

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
AND TO INDIVIDUAL
ENJOYMENT.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
EXTENSIVE PRIVATE
COLLECTIONS, SUCH AS

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
THIS ONE OF MODERN
FRENCH ART CREATED BY THE

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
WEALTHY INDUSTRIALIST
SERGEI SHCHUKIN,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
WERE NATIONALIZED AND PUT
INTO STATE MUSEUMS.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
PHOTOGRAPHY, ON THE OTHER
HAND, CAME TO BE SEEN

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
AS AN APPROPRIATE
MEDIUM TO SERVE THE

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
COLLECTIVE NEEDS OF
THE NEW SOVIET SOCIETY.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
IN THE 1920'S, ALEXANDER
RODCHENKO ADOPTED

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
THE TECHNIQUE
OF PHOTOMONTAGE -

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
ASSEMBLING DIFFERENT
PHOTOGRAPHIC FRAGMENTS

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:44.000
AND MOUNTING THEM
INTO A SINGLE IMAGE.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
THE READY-MADE FRAGMENTS
OF PHOTOMONTAGE

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
ARE PUT TOGETHER IN UNUSUAL,
JARRING COMBINATIONS

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
WHERE SIZE AND SCALE ARE MADE
DELIBERATELY DISCONTINUOUS

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
TO CREATE
NEW MEANINGS.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
THESE ILLUSTRATE A LOVE
POEM BY VLADIMIR MAYAKOVSKY.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
HERE THE CITY IS SHOWN AS
THE MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
MAYAKOVSKY'S TELEPHONE
CALL IS MADE.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
IN FILM, THE IDEA OF
MONTAGE WAS ADAPTED

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
TO THE SPECIAL CHARACTER
OF THE MOVING IMAGE.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
SHOTS WERE EDITED IN
VARYING SEQUENCES OF TIME.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
THIS, FOR EXAMPLE,
IS FROM "STRIKE",

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
EISENSTEIN'S
FIRST MAJOR FILM.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
IT SHOWS HERE WORKERS
MOVING LIKE SAND IN AN

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
EGG-TIMER THROUGH THE
NARROW FACTORY GATES,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
THEN CUTS TO A
PIECE OF MACHINERY,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
WHICH BECOMES SUPERIMPOSED
WITH STRIKING WORKERS

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
WHO ARE THE HEROES
OF THE FILM.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
THE VISUAL IMPACT OF
MONTAGE DEPENDS ON A

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
SERIES OF "SHOCK EFFECTS"
WHICH, FOR EISENSTEIN,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
MEANT THAT EACH
SUCCESSIVE IMAGE

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
HAD TO BE OF
MAXIMUM INTENSITY.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
BUT HE ALSO MAINTAINED
THE ATTENTION OF

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
VIEWERS BY INCLUDING
COMIC INTERLUDES

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
REMINISCENT OF THE
CIRCUS OR THE MUSIC HALL.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
IN THIS SEQUENCE FROM
"STRIKE" THE LEADER OF

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
A BAND OF PETTY THIEVES,
THE SO-CALLED "KING",

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
IS BEING VISITED ON THE
DERELICT OUTSKIRTS OF

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
THE CITY BY A SECRET
POLICEMAN IN THE PAY OF

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
THE FACTORY BOSSES
- THE CAPITALISTS.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
BY PLAYING ON THE KING'S
VANITY AND SELF-IMPORTANCE

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
THE POLICEMAN IS ABLE
TO BUY HIS ASSISTANCE

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
AND RECRUIT HIS MOB
AS AGENT PROVOCATEURS

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
TO START UP TROUBLE
AND PROVIDE THE POLICE

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
WITH AN EXCUSE TO ATTACK
THE STRIKING WORKERS.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
EISENSTEIN DELIBERATELY
PORTRAYS THESE OUTCASTS

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
AS A DEGENERATE
AND CRAVEN MOB -

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
THE FLOTSAM AND JETSAM
OF BOURGEOIS SOCIETY

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
WITH AN IMITATION KING
AND MAKE-BELIEVE EMPIRE.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
THEIR COMIC UGLINESS
AND BIZARRE EXISTENCE

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
ARE USED AS A CONTRAST
TO THE GENUINE STRUGGLE

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
AND COLLECTIVE HEROISM
OF THE STRIKING WORKERS.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
IN HIS FILMS, EISENSTEIN
TRIED TO AVOID USING

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
PROFESSIONAL ACTORS,
PREFERRING TO CAST FACES

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
OR PHYSICAL TYPES
TO SUIT A PART.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
HE REJECTED ORTHODOX
STAGE ACTING WITH ITS

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
EMPHASIS ON THE
INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE OF

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
HIS COMMITMENT TO
SEEING THE INDIVIDUAL

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
AS ONLY A PART OF
A COLLECTIVE MASS.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO
MAKING HIS FILM ABOUT

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
THE REVOLUTION A FEW
YEARS LATER, HE HAD TO

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM OF
HOW TO REPRESENT LENIN.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
EISENSTEIN TRIED TO SHOW
LENIN'S ROLE AS BEING

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
ONLY PART OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
BUT HE DID USE A
LOOK-ALIKE, CASTING HIM

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
IN CONVENTIONAL
HEROIC POSES.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
CRITICS ON THE LEFT
- MAYAKOVSKY FOR ONE -

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
OBJECTED TO WHAT THEY
CALLED THIS "FAKE LENIN",

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
WHICH THEY COMPARED TO THE
WORK OF "CLICHE PAINTERS".

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
GERASIMOV'S WORK IS
TYPICAL OF THIS KIND OF

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
SOCIALIST REALISM.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
SUCH HEROIC CLICHES
SUITED THE CULT OF

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
LENIN'S PERSONALITY
BEING FOSTERED UNDER

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
THE STALINIST REGIME
AFTER LENIN'S DEATH.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
AS A FILM MAKER, EISENSTEIN
USED INDIVIDUAL FACES

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
TO REPRESENT SOCIAL
CLASSES AND TYPES.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
NOT IN A WAY WHICH SIMPLY
SET OUT TO REFLECT REALITY,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
BUT AS COMPONENTS TO BE
ASSEMBLED IN MONTAGE.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
IN THIS SCENE FROM
"OCTOBER",

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
AN ESCAPING BOLSHEVIK
DEMONSTRATOR,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
DESPERATE TO SAVE HIS
BANNER, BECOMES TRAPPED

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000
AMONGST BOURGEOIS
PLEASURE SEEKERS.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
WHAT BEGINS WITH ALMOST
COMIC EXAGGERATION

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
QUICKLY TURNS TO EXTREME
VIOLENCE AS THE WOMEN

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
TURN ON HIM WITH
THEIR PARASOLS.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:11.000
*

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:45.000
*

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
UNDERLYING THE STRUCTURE
OF EISENSTEIN'S

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
EPIC NARRATIVE ARE THE
SPACES OF THE CITY -

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
THE STREET, THE
HABITAT OF THE CROWD.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
ST. PETERSBURG, THE
FORMER TSARIST CAPITAL,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
IS THE SITE OF
REVOLUTION WHERE

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
THE MASSES
TRANSFORM THE CITY.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
SO, THE STORY OF
"OCTOBER" UNFOLDS

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
IN PLACE AS WELL
AS IN TIME.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
IN ORDER TO STOP
THE ESCAPE OF THE

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
REVOLUTIONARY DEMONSTRATORS,
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
ORDERS THE
WORKER'S DISTRICT

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
TO BE CUT OFF FROM
THE CENTRAL CITY

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
BY RAISING THE BRIDGES
OVER THE RIVER NEVA.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
THE RUPTURE OR SPLIT
BETWEEN THE BOURGEOIS

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000
AND WORKING CLASSES IS
DRAMATICALLY REPRESENTED.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
THESE ARE POWERFUL IMAGES,
INTENSIFIED BY THE

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
UNEXPECTED JUXTAPOSITION
OF HUMAN TRAGEDY

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000
WITH THE FORMAL DETAILS OF
THE BRIDGE'S IRON STRUCTURE.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:16.000
*

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
EISENSTEIN SET IMAGES
AGAINST EACH OTHER -

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
IN CONTRAST, OR WHAT HE
LIKED TO CALL "COLLISION".

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
AND, CENTRAL TO THE
STRUCTURE OF "OCTOBER"

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
IS THE CONTRAST EISENSTEIN
SETS UP BETWEEN

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
THE PUBLIC TERRAIN
OF THE STREETS

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
AND THE GUARDED INTERIOR
OF THE WINTER PALACE.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
THIS, THE FORMER TZAR'S
PALACE, HAD BECOME

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
THE HEADQUARTERS
OF THE BOURGEOIS

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT,
LED BY KERENSKY.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
SIGNIFICANTLY, HE
MAKES THE DEFENDERS

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000
OF THE INTERIOR A
BATTALION OF WOMEN.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
ALTHOUGH SUCH A
BATTALION EXISTED,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
EISENSTEIN EXAGGERATED
ITS HISTORICAL ROLE

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
FOR THE SAKE OF THE
FILM'S SYMBOLISM.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
*

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
THOUGH SOLDIERS, THEY
ARE SHOWN TO BE MAKING

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
THEIR MAKESHIFT BARRACKS,
THE FORMER TZAR'S

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
BILLIARD ROOM, INTO
A SORT OF BOUDOIR.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
THE WOMEN APPEAR AS
CONFUSING FIGURES OF

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
TRANSITION BETWEEN A
BOURGEOIS WORLD

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
AND REVOLUTION.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
THESE IMAGES OF WOMEN
ARE CONTRASTED WITH THE

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
POSITIVE LIBERATING FORCE
OF THE COLLECTIVE MASS,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
AND OF THE MALE
REVOLUTIONARY WHO IS

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
THE EMBLEM OF "OCTOBER".

00:12:44.000 --> 00:13:10.000
*

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
LOOKING AT FILMS
ON TELEVISION,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
PROBABLY AT HOME, IS
VERY DIFFERENT FROM

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
THE COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE
OF GOING TO THE CINEMA.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
IN THE 1920'S MANY
SOVIET FILM MAKERS

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
SELF-CONSCIOUSLY
ANALYZED WHAT THEY SAW

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
AS THE PARTICULAR
LANGUAGE OF FILM.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
THIS LED THEM TO REVEAL
RATHER THAN CONCEAL THE

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
TECHNIQUES OF FILM MAKING
- DRAWING ATTENTION, EVEN,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
TO THE PROCESS
OF VIEWING A FILM.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
"MAN WITH A MOVIE CAMERA"
BY DZIGA VERTOV BEGINS BY

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:49.000
SHOWING THE RAW MATERIAL
OF FILM ITSELF.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
FOLLOWED BY THE CINEMATIC
CONCEIT OF PRESENTING

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
THE VIEWERS WITH
THEIR OWN SELF IMAGE.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
FOR THE CINEMA GOER THIS
SET THE TERMS THAT THEY

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
WERE PART OF A
COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE -

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
BOTH THE SUBJECT OF THE
FILM AND ITS AUDIENCE.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
VERTOV'S FILM "MAN WITH A
MOVIE CAMERA" IS ABOUT A

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CITY
- IN THIS CASE MOSCOW,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
THE SOVIET CAPITAL.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
FOR A DOCUMENTARY
FILM MAKER LIKE VERTOV,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
FILMS SHOULD NOT BE
"PLAYED" OR "ACTED" AT ALL.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
HE SAW HIMSELF AS THE
"CAMERA EYE" WHO FILMED

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
LIFE AS IT HAPPENED
IN THE MODERN CITY.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
THIS SEQUENCE DEALS
WITH A STREET ACCIDENT.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
WE NEVER ACTUALLY
SEE THE ACCIDENT BUT,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
THROUGH MONTAGE, VERTOV
ASSEMBLED A SERIES

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
OF FRAGMENTED
DISORIENTATING EFFECTS

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
THAT SIMULATE
THE EXPERIENCE.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
ONCE THE AMBULANCE HAS
BEEN CALLED, VERTOV FILMS

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000
THE "MAN WITH THE MOVIE
CAMERA" PURSUING IT.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
THE WHOLE FILM IS ABOUT
THE PROCESS OF FILM MAKING

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
AND ITS RELATION
TO MODERN LIFE.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
IT DID NOT SIMPLY
RECORD EVENTS BUT

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
EXPOSED THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN NORMAL WAYS

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000
OF LOOKING AND THE
MECHANICAL CAMERA EYE.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
THROUGH MONTAGE, VERTOV
MADE THE FAMILIAR APPEAR

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.000
IN AN UNFAMILIAR WAY.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
CUTTING TOGETHER
DIFFERENT IMAGES OF WORK

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
- WOMEN PACKING CIGARETTES,
WORKING AT A SWITCHBOARD

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
- VERTOV
JUGGLED CONTEXTS.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
THROUGH A CHAIN
OF ASSOCIATIONS,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
ROUTINE, RHYTHM AND
REPETITION WERE SHOWN AS

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
TYPICAL FEATURES OF
MODERNITY AND FORMAL

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:48.000
ANALOGIES CONNECT THE
MANUAL WITH THE MECHANICAL.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
THOUGH COMMITTED TO
DOCUMENTARY FILM MAKING,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
VERTOV PRESENTED HIS
AUDIENCE WITH A HIGHLY

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
SELECTIVE VIEW OF MOSCOW,
DWELLING ON THOSE ASPECTS

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
WHICH FITTED HIS
VIEW OF MODERNITY.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
AND HE MADE THE
RELATIONSHIP

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
BETWEEN MODERNITY
AND MONTAGE EXPLICIT

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
IN HIS HIGHLY
SELF-CONSCIOUS TECHNIQUE.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
EISENSTEIN OBJECTED TO
VERTOV'S FORMALISM,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
WHAT HE SAW AS MERELY
THE DISPLAY OF TRICKS,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
JUST AS VERTOV CRITICIZED
EISENSTEIN'S USE OF

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
NARRATIVE FOR RECREATING
HISTORICAL EVENTS.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
BUT WHAT "MAN WITH A MOVIE
CAMERA" HAS IN COMMON

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
WITH "OCTOBER" IS
THE FOCUS ON THE MASS -

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
THE CROWD IN THE CITY.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
THERE IS A
DIFFERENCE, THOUGH.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
VERTOV'S FILM HAS
ANOTHER HERO AS WELL.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
THE CAMERAMAN HIMSELF,
SUPERIMPOSED OVER

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
THE ANONYMOUS
URBAN MASS.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
THIS CONCERN WITH THE
CITY WAS NOT CONFINED

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
TO SOVIET DIRECTORS.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
IN 1927, THE GERMAN,
WALTER RUTTMAN, MADE A

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
FILM CALLED "BERLIN, THE
SYMPHONY OF A GREAT CITY".

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
ALTHOUGH WORKING IN A
VERY DIFFERENT SOCIAL

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
AND POLITICAL CONTEXT TO
EISENSTEIN AND VERTOV,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
RUTTMAN'S DOCUMENTARY
ALSO FOCUSED ON

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
A CROSS-SECTION OF
THE MODERN CITY.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
PRE-DATING VERTOV'S
FILM BY TWO YEARS,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
IT RECORDED A DAY IN
THE LIFE OF BERLIN,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
FROM MORNING TIL NIGHT.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
AS CITY LIFE GETS UNDERWAY
SHUTTERS ARE RAISED.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
BERLIN IS REVEALED AS
A CITY OF COMMERCE.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
BUT THE INHABITANTS OF
THE CITY REMAIN ANONYMOUS.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
OFFICE WORKERS, OBLIVIOUS
OF THE CAMERA,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
ENTER A BUILDING
FITTED WITH

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
MODERN MECHANICAL
ELEVATORS.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
RUTTMAN SAW THE TEMPO OF
MODERN LIFE AS INHERENT

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
IN THESE IMAGES,
WHERE THE CUTTING IS

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
RHYTHMICAL, INCREASINGLY
RAPID AND STACCATO.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
THE EFFECT OF THE MONTAGE
IS TO CONNECT THE

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
REPETITIVE FORMS OF
MODERN OFFICE WORK

00:19:46.000 --> 00:20:00.000
WITH MODERN MACHINERY.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
THE CRITICISM LEVELED AT
RUTTMAN EVEN BY HIS OWN

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
COLLEAGUES WHILE
WORKING ON THE FILM

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
WAS HIS POLITICAL
NEUTRALITY.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
RUTTMAN SAW HIMSELF
AS A NEUTRAL OBSERVER,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:22.000
UNENGAGED WITH THE POLITICAL
CONTENT OF HIS IMAGES.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
IN THIS SEQUENCE,
FORMAL IMAGES OF A

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:37.000
SWIRLING MOTION
DEVELOP INTO A VORTEX.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
THESE SEEMINGLY DISPARATE
IMAGES ARE CONNECTED ONLY

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:53.000
BY THIS MOVEMENT
OF ROTATION.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
EVEN A SUICIDE BECOMES
MERELY ANOTHER ASPECT

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
OF THE VISUAL TEXTURE
OF THE CITY'S SURFACE,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
ANOTHER IMAGE
OF ROTATION.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
WHETHER OBSERVING THE
TENSIONS OF CITY LIFE

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
OR ITS ENTERTAINMENTS,
IT WAS THESE FORMAL

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
ANALOGIES WHICH PRIMARILY
CONCERNED RUTTMAN.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
HERE THE MOVEMENTS OF THE
DANCERS' ARMS AND LEGS

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
ECHO THE RHYTHMS
OF MACHINERY.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
THE ORIGINAL MUSIC
COMPOSED BY EDMUND MEISEL

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
TO ACCOMPANY THE FILM HAS
NOW BEEN LOST, BUT THE

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
"SYMPHONY" OF THE FILM'S
TITLE REFERRED TO

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
RUTTMAN'S SENSE OF THE
MUSICALITY OF THE CITY,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
REVEALED IN THE
RHYTHM OF MONTAGE.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:15.000
THIS IS PART OF THE
FINAL SEQUENCE AT NIGHT.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
IT'S A EULOGY TO ARTIFICE
AND THE SPECTACLE OF NEON;

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000
TO THE IMAGES OF
DISPLAY AND CONSUMPTION.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
HERE RUTTMAN'S USE
OF MONTAGE PRESENTS

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF
MODERNITY TO THAT OF

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
THE SOVIET FILM MAKERS.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
BUT IT IS STILL A
COLLECTIVE FANTASY

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
LIVED OUT IN PUBLIC
- AND ONE WHICH DEALS

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
NOT ONLY WITH PEOPLE,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
BUT THE SPACES
OF THE CITY ITSELF.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
AND IT WAS THROUGH MONTAGE
- THE WAY FILM WAS ASSEMBLED

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:56.000
- THAT THIS IMAGE OF
MODERNITY WAS PROJECTED.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:35.000
*
