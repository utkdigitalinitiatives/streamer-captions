WEBVTT

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I BET YOU'VE WATCHED A
FEW MOVIES IN YOUR TIME.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
ANYTHING FROM COMEDIES
TO ACTION MOVIES

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
AND HORROR FLICKS.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
YOU NAME IT, I BET
YOU'VE SEEN IT.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
YOU'RE PROBABLY EVEN
THINKING YOU'VE SEEN

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
SOMETHING LIKE
THIS BEFORE.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
YOU SEE, FILM IS
A VISUAL LANGUAGE.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
JUST LIKE WE HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO READ AND WRITE,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW
TO MAKE SENSE OF

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
WHAT YOU SEE
ON THE SCREEN.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THE COMPLEX LANGUAGE

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
OF FILM AND TELEVISION.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
MOST OF THE FILM AND
TELEVISION PROGRAMS

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
YOU WATCH BEGIN IN
A PLACE LIKE THIS -

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
A PRODUCTION HOUSE.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
THEY BEGIN WITH AN IDEA
WHICH IS USUALLY DISCUSSED

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
IN A SCRIPT MEETING
LIKE THIS ONE.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
AND ONCE THE STORY
IS DECIDED UPON

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
THE WRITER WILL SIT DOWN
AND WRITE THE SCRIPT.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
HOW'S IT GOING, GANG?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
HI JUDY!

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
THEN THE FINISHED SCRIPT
GOES INTO PRODUCTION.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
THAT'S WHEN THE CAST
AND CREW TAKE THE SCRIPT

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
AND SHOOT THE
FILM OR VIDEO.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
RECORDING AND... ACTION!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
AND FINALLY THERE'S
POST-PRODUCTION WHERE

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
THE FOOTAGE IS EDITED
INTO THE FINAL VERSION

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
WE SEE ON OUR SCREENS.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
HI GEORGE.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
HI JUDY.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
WHAT ARE YOU
WORKING ON?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'M MAKING THIS HORROR
FILM ABOUT A SERIAL KILLER

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
THAT'S ON THE LOOSE
AND THERE'S THIS GIRL

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
STUCK AT WORK.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I WROTE THE
SCRIPT FOR THAT.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
REALLY?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
YEAH.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
COME HAVE A LOOK
AT THE LAST BIT.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
THE KILLER GETS
IT IN THE END.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
BUT JUST WHEN YOU
THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE...

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW
THESE THINGS GO;

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
IT'S A HORROR FLICK.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
YOU THINK THEY'RE
DEAD... BUT ARE THEY?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
YOU JUST CAN'T GET RID
OF THEM THAT EASILY.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
ARRRRGH!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
FRANK!

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
DON'T DO THAT.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
SORRY.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ANYWAY, ARE YOU

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
TALKING TO
YOURSELF AGAIN?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I'M JUST EXPLAINING A
HORROR MOVIE THAT I WROTE.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
PRETTY STANDARD HORROR
FLICK, YOU KNOW,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
GIRL LEFT ALONE AT
WORK BY HERSELF,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
SERIAL KILLER
ON THE LOOSE.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE END?
DO THEY GET THE KILLER?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
OF COURSE THEY DO.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
YEAH, BUT DID
HE REALLY DIE?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I'M NOT GOING TO
TELL YOU THAT, FRANK.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
WATCH IT AND FIND OUT.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH
JUDY, I'M NOT REALLY

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
ALL THAT KEEN ON
HORROR MOVIES.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
NO? YOU'RE NOT SCARED,
ARE YOU FRANK?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
NO...

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
HEY, LOOK, I'M AN
ACTION JUNKIE, OKAY?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
GIVE ME AN ACTION
FILM ANY DAY.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I LOVE THE CHASES AND
THE FIGHTS AND THE CARS

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
AND HOW THEY ARREST
THE BAD GUY AT THE END,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
SNAP THE CUFFS
ON HIM AND SAY

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
"HEY, YOU'RE BUSTED!"

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
JEEZ, FRANK, I THINK
YOU'VE MISSED YOUR CALLING.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
FRANK!

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
SORRY, JUDY, BETTER GO.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
WE ALL HAVE OUR
FAVORITE TYPES OF FILMS.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
HORROR, ROMANCE, ACTION
AND DRAMA ARE SOME OF

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
THE MOST POPULAR GENRES.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
FOR MOST OF US, WATCHING
ONE OR TWO OF THESE TYPES

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
OF FILMS WILL GIVE US
ENOUGH OF AN UNDERSTANDING

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
OF HOW THE NEXT
MOVIE WILL BE.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
THIS IS USUALLY BECAUSE
GENRES HAVE CONVENTIONS

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
THAT ARE EASILY
RECOGNIZABLE.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
FOR INSTANCE, HORROR FANS
CAN EXPECT THE KILLER

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
TO COME BACK AT THE
END FOR ONE LAST SCARE.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
PEOPLE WHO LIKE ROMANTIC
COMEDIES KNOW THAT

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
THE UNLIKELY COUPLE WILL
EVENTUALLY SHARE A KISS.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
AND A HIGH-OCTANE ACTION
FLICK IS LIKELY TO CONTAIN

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
AT LEAST ONE CAR CHASE
AND A COUPLE OF EXPLOSIONS

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
BEFORE THE HERO WINS OUT.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
THESE ARE ALL CONVENTIONAL
ELEMENTS OF A GENRE FILM'S

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
NARRATIVE STRUCTURE.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
WE MAKE SENSE OF THE
FILM BY RECOGNIZING

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
THESE ELEMENTS AND
REACTING TO THEM.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
RARELY DO NARRATIVE
FILMS DRAW ATTENTION

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
TO THE STYLISTIC ELEMENTS
THAT HELP MAKE UP

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
THE FILM'S FORM LIKE
THE LIGHTING, THE SOUND,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
THE EDITING, THE
CAMERA ANGLES.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
USUALLY THESE THINGS ARE
HIDDEN FROM THE VIEWER

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
SO AS TO CREATE A KIND
OF ONSCREEN REALITY.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
BUT NOTHING ABOUT FILM IS
REAL, SO WE NEED TO LEARN

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
HOW TO RECOGNIZE AND
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
FILM TECHNIQUES THAT
HELP A NON-PRINT TEXT

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
CONVEY MEANING.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
AND RECORDING... AND ACTION!

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
FIRST THING I NEED TO DO IS
GRAB ANOTHER CUP OF COFFEE.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
JUDY?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
YES.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
HI PAUL.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
JUDY, HAVE YOU FINISHED
THAT SCRIPT YET?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
THE ONE ABOUT THE LANGUAGE
OF FILM AND TELEVISION?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
OH, NO, NOT YET.
I'M STILL WORKING ON IT.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I REALLY NEED IT ON
MY DESK BY 9:00 AM

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
TOMORROW MORNING.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
YEAH, I WAS GOING TO
STAY BACK LATER TONIGHT

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
AND FINISH IT OFF.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
THAT'S GREAT.
THANKS, JUDY.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
THANKS.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
WOULD YOU MIND SHUTTING
THE DOOR, PLEASE.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
YEAH.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
MUCH LIKE A NOVEL OR
SHORT STORY, THE NARRATIVE

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
ELEMENTS OF A CONVENTIONAL
NARRATIVE FILM

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
USUALLY UNFOLD
THROUGH ITS CHARACTERS

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
AND IN PARTICULAR THROUGH
THE CENTRAL CHARACTER,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
OR THE PROTAGONIST.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
WE'RE USUALLY INTRODUCED
TO THE PROTAGONIST

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
AT THE VERY BEGINNING
OF THE FILM.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
THE ACTIONS OF THIS
CHARACTER, THE OBSTACLES

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
THAT BEFALL HIM OR HER,
AND THE WAY IN WHICH HE

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
OR SHE DEALS WITH THEM,
USUALLY WORK TO PROPEL

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
THE STORY FORWARD TO ITS
END POINT, OR CLIMAX.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
BUT WHEN WE SEE A FILM
WE DON'T ONLY ENGAGE

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
WITH THE NARRATIVE,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
NOR DO WE MAKE SENSE
OF A FILM LIKE WE'D

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
MAKE SENSE OF A
NOVEL OR SHORT STORY

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
- BY INTERPRETING THE
WORDS ON THE PAGE.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
A FILM TEXT HAS ITS
OWN UNIQUE WAY OF

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
COMMUNICATING
WITH THE VIEWER.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
IN ORDER FOR US TO FULLY
UNDERSTAND A FILM,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE
TECHNIQUES AND FEATURES

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
OF THE FILM MEDIUM.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
THE FOUR POINTS I THINK
ARE A REALLY GOOD GUIDE TO

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
GETTING ON TOP OF READING
THESE FILMS AS TEXT...

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
AND THE FOUR POINTS THAT
ARE IMPORTANT FOR US TO

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
THINK ABOUT WHEN
WE'RE DOING THIS ARE

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
- CERTAINLY CINEMATOGRAPHY -
WHAT THE CAMERA IS DOING,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
THE WAY THE CAMERA
SEES THE ACTION,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
WHERE THE CAMERA
IS PLACED.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
SECONDLY, I THINK IT'S
IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
WHAT GOES INTO THE FIELD
OF VISION FOR THE CAMERA

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
AND THAT'S OFTEN GIVEN
THE TERM "MISE-EN-SCENE",

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
THE FRENCH TERM WHICH MEANS
LITERALLY THAT WHICH IS

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
PLACED INTO THE SCENE OR
INTO THE ACTION OF THE SCENE

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
AND THAT CAN BE A
VARIOUS RANGE OF THINGS.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
THIRDLY, I THINK,
AND IMPORTANTLY

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
IS THE ISSUE OF SOUND.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
WHERE DOES
SOUND COME FROM?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
IS IT A SOUNDTRACK?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
IS IT A POPULAR SONG?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
IS IT PLAYING WITHIN THE
ENVIRONMENT OF THE ACTION

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
OR IS IT IMPOSED ON
TOP OF THE ACTION?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
FOURTHLY, AND I THINK IN
A SENSE, WHERE THE FILM

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
IS ACTUALLY MADE IS
IN THE EDITING ROOM.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
THE IDEA OF HOW
A FILM IS CUT

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
OR HOW SHOTS ARE
PUT TOGETHER.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
MOST PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF
EDITING, CAMERA SHOTS

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
AND PLACING SOUND TO FILM,
BUT HOW MANY OF THEM

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
ACTUALLY NOTICE IT?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
AND HOW MANY OF YOU
HAVE HEARD OF THE TERM

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
MISE-EN-SCENE?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
COSTUME AND SCENERY WE
WOULD USUALLY CONSIDER

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
AS PART OF
MISE-EN-SCENE:

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
THAT WHICH IS PUT
INTO THE SCENE.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
WE OFTEN TAKE COSTUME
AND SCENERY FOR GRANTED,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
PARTICULARLY IN
FILMS THAT ARE

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
SET IN A
CONTEMPORARY SETTING.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
HOWEVER, NOTHING GOES
INTO THE SHOT THAT ISN'T

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
TOTALLY THE OBJECT OF
SOMEONE'S DESIRE -

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
USUALLY THE DIRECTOR
OR, IN THIS CASE,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
THE COSTUME DESIGNER
OR THE SET DESIGNER.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
WATCH THIS SCENE AGAIN
AND SEE HOW ALTERATIONS

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
TO THE MISE-EN-SCENE
ALTER THE WAY IN WHICH

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
WE PERCEIVE THE ACTION.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
JUDY? CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
YEAH.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
HI PAUL.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
JUDY, HAVE YOU FINISHED
THAT SCRIPT YET?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
THE ONE ABOUT THE LANGUAGE
OF FILM AND TELEVISION?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
OH, NO, NOT YET.
I'M STILL WORKING ON IT.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I NEED IT ON MY DESK BY
9:00 AM TOMORROW MORNING.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
YEAH, I WAS GOING
TO STAY BACK TONIGHT

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.000
AND FINISH IT OFF.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
OKAY, THANKS JUDY.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
THANKS.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
AND CLOSE THE DOOR.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
JUDY? CAN I SEE YOU
FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
HI PAUL.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
JUDY, HAVE YOU FINISHED
THAT SCRIPT YET?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
THE ONE ABOUT THE LANGUAGE
OF FILM AND TELEVISION?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
OH, NO, NOT YET.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I'M STILL
FINISHING IT OFF.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
LOOK, I REALLY NEED IT BY
9:00 AM TOMORROW MORNING.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
YEAH, I'LL STAY BACK
TONIGHT AND FINISH IT OFF.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
THAT'D BE GREAT.
THANKS, JUDY.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
OKAY.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000
JUDY? COULD YOU SHUT
THE DOOR, PLEASE?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
THESE CHOICES OF COSTUME
AND SET DESIGN HAVE,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
AGAIN, A VERY STRONG
IMPRESSION BOTH ON

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
THE CHARACTERS
IN THE ACTION

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
AND ON THE SPECTATOR
VIEWING THE SCENE.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
BEYOND THAT WE THINK ABOUT
THE WAY A SCENE IS LIT.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
NOW THAT MAY ALSO BE SEEN
AS PART OF MISE-EN-SCENE

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR
CINEMATOGRAPHY AS WELL.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
CAMERA MEN OR CAMERA
WOMEN ARE ALWAYS

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
VERY MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT
THE WAY A SCENE IS LIT

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
AND HOW THAT IMPACTS ON
WHAT THE CAMERA SEES.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
SO I'M GOING TO BE SCARY?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
DOWN THERE, CROUCHING
BEHIND THE COUCH.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
NOW, BE SCARY, OKAY?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
ALL RIGHT, I'LL
SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW CHANGES
TO LIGHTING AND CONTRAST

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
CAN GREATLY INFLUENCE
THE IMPACT OF A SCENE.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
AS YOU CAN SEE
HERE, THIS DOESN'T

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
SEEM VERY SCARY, RIGHT?

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
THE ROOM IS WELL LIT, YOU
CAN SEE FRANK, AND YOU CAN

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
SEE GEORGE HIDING AT
THE SIDE OF THE COUCH.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
OVERALL THERE'S VERY
LITTLE IMPACT TO THE SCENE.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
BUT NOW, HIT THE LIGHTS.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
BY ALTERING THE LIGHTING
AND CONTRAST OF THE SCENE,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
YOU IMMEDIATELY NOTICE
A CHANGE IN MOOD

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
AND ATMOSPHERE.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
A DIRECTOR CAN USE THE
LIGHTING TO GUIDE

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
THE VIEWER'S ATTENTION
TO CERTAIN OBJECTS

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
AND TO CONCEAL OTHERS.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
IT'S JUST LIKE IN A HORROR
MOVIE WHERE THE KILLER

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
EMERGES FROM THE DARKNESS
INTO A SHAFT OF LIGHT.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
OKAY! HIT THE LIGHTS.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
THANKS GUYS.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
WAS THAT IT?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
WAS I SCARY ENOUGH?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
SO AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S NOT
JUST THE CHARACTERS' WORDS

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
THAT NEED TO
BE UNDERSTOOD.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
FILM IS A
VISUAL LANGUAGE.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
AND JUST AS WE LEARN TO
RECOGNIZE LETTERS AND

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
WORDS AND THE MEANINGS
THAT THEY SIGNIFY, WE ALSO

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
NEED TO LEARN TO READ
MOVIE TEXTS AND RECOGNIZE

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS
THAT MAKE UP A FILM'S FORM

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
SO AS TO MAKE MEANING
AND DRAW CONCLUSIONS.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
IN SHORT, WE MAKE SENSE
OF FILM BY RECOGNIZING

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
BOTH ITS NARRATIVE
AND STYLISTIC ELEMENTS

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
AND REACTING TO THEM.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
HMM. WRITE THAT ONE DOWN.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
(KNOCKING)

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
COME IN.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
HEY, JUDE. HOW'S IT GOING?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
YEAH, ALMOST DONE.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
COOL. I'M GONNA
GET HOME, OKAY?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
JUST THOUGHT I'D LET YOU KNOW
YOU'RE THE LAST ONE HERE.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I'LL COME WITH YOU AND
GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
JUDE, ARE YOU GOING TO
BE ALRIGHT BY YOURSELF?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
YEAH, I'M ALWAYS HERE
LATE. I'LL BE FINE.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE
SURE YOU LOCK THE DOOR

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
BEHIND ME, OKAY?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
WHY? IS SOMETHING WRONG?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
YOU HEARD THE REPORT
ON THE NEWS, RIGHT?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
WHAT REPORT?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
ABOUT THE ESCAPED KILLER.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
HE'S A REAL PSYCHO.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
DON'T WORRY,
YOU'LL BE FINE.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
JUST MAKE SURE YOU
LOCK THE DOOR, OKAY?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
"...IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.
 IF YOU DO SEE HIM

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
PLEASE DO NOT TRY AND
 APPREHEND HIM YOURSELF".

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
BYE, JUDY.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
SEE YOU, FRANK.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
DID YOU LOCK IT?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
YEAH, I LOCKED IT.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
BYE.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
CAMERA, OR CINEMATOGRAPHY
AS WE SOMETIMES CALL IT,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
IS A MAJOR ELEMENT IN THE
PRODUCTION OF ALL FILM

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
AND TELEVISION PROGRAMS.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
IT'S WHAT THE CAMERA
CAPTURES SO, ULTIMATELY,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
IT'S WHAT WE SEE
ON OUR SCREEN.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT
ASPECTS WHICH MAKE UP

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
THIS IMPORTANT FIELD
AND, AS YOU SAW EARLIER,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
LIGHTING IS
JUST ONE OF THEM.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
OTHER AREAS OF CAMERA
INCLUDE FRAMING,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
CAMERA SHOTS, CAMERA
ANGLES, AND MOVEMENT.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
CLASSICALLY - THAT
IS COMMERCIALLY AND

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
TRADITIONALLY -
CINEMATOGRAPHY IS ABOUT

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
CAMERA MOVEMENT, ABOUT THE
WAY THAT LIGHT WORKS WITH

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
WHAT THE CAMERA SEES, WE
MIGHT ALSO EXTEND THAT

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
TO ISSUES OF COLOR.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
BUT PRIMARILY I THINK
WE OFTEN THINK ABOUT

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
CINEMATOGRAPHY AND CAMERA
WORK WHEN WE DON'T NOTICE IT

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
- THAT IDEA OF
THE STABLE CAMERA.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
BUT BEYOND THAT AND
PERHAPS MUCH MORE POPULAR

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
THESE DAYS WITH FILMS LIKE
 THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
OR FILMS LIKE WOODY ALLEN'S
 HUSBANDS AND WIVES ,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
THE MOVING CAMERA IS A
REALLY IMPORTANT WAY

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
OF PORTRAYING A SCENE.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
THE FRAMING'S IMPORTANT
BECAUSE IT CONTROLS,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
WITHIN FOUR WALLS, THE
IMAGE FOR THE VIEWER.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
THE FRAMING CONTROLS THE
VANTAGE POINT FROM WHICH

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
THE VIEWER CAN
WATCH THE ACTION.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
THESE INCLUDE FRONT-ON,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
FROM BEHIND,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
AND SIDE-ON SHOTS.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
THE FRAMING ALSO CONTROLS
THE ANGLE AT WHICH

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
OBJECTS WITHIN THE
SHOT ARE SHOWN.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
THE ANGLE AT WHICH
SOMETHING IS SHOT

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
CAN GREATLY ALTER
ITS EFFECT.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
FOR INSTANCE, A HIGH
ANGLE SHOT, WHICH

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
INVOLVES SHOOTING
SOMETHING FROM ABOVE,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
CAN MAKE THE SUBJECT
LOOK SMALLER.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
AND A LOW ANGLE SHOT,
WHICH IS SHOT FROM BELOW,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
CAN MAKE THE OBJECT SEEM
LARGER OR MORE POWERFUL

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
THAN WHAT THEY ARE.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
AND A DUTCH ANGLE SHOT,OR
DUTCH TILT, WHERE THE

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
CAMERA'S TILTED ON AN
ANGLE, CAN PROVIDE A SENSE

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
OF DISORIENTATION OR
UNEASINESS FOR THE VIEWER.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
FRAMING ALSO CONTROLS THE
SENSE OF DISTANCE BETWEEN

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.000
THE VIEWER AND THE
ACTION ON THE SCREEN.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
HERE'S A QUICK RUNDOWN OF
SOME OF THE TYPES OF SHOTS

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
AND THE WAY THEY
CAN BE USED.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
THEY ARE THE EXTREME
LONG-SHOT: USUALLY RESERVED

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
FOR FRAMING LANDSCAPES,
CITIES AND COASTLINES

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
AND IN WHICH THE HUMAN
BODY IS BARELY VISIBLE.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
THE LONG SHOT: IN WHICH
THE HUMAN FIGURES ARE

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
PROMINENT BUT IN WHICH THE
LANDSCAPE STILL DOMINATES.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
THE MEDIUM LONG SHOT:
WHERE PEOPLE CAN BE SEEN

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
FROM ABOUT
THE KNEES UP.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
THE MEDIUM SHOT: IN
WHICH THEY CAN BE SEEN

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
FROM THE WAIST UP.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
THE MEDIUM CLOSE UP:
WHICH FRAMES SOMEONE

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
FROM THE CHEST UP.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
THE CLOSE UP: WHICH
USUALLY FOCUSES ON

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
A FACE OR A
SPECIFIC OBJECT.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
AND THE EXTREME CLOSE
UP: IN WHICH THE FRAMING

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
FOCUSES THE VIEWER'S
ATTENTION ON DETAIL.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
REMEMBER THAT THE CONTEXT
OF THE FILM'S NARRATIVE

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
WILL INFLUENCE THE
MEANING THAT IS MADE

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
BY THE FRAMING
TECHNIQUES.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
A CLOSE-UP EXCHANGE IN A
ROMANTIC SOAP OPERA

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
WILL SIGNIFY A DIFFERENT
MEANING THAN, SAY,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
THE CLOSE-UP USED IN NEWS
FOOTAGE OF A CONVICTED

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
CON MAN OR A CLOSE-UP
IN A HORROR FILM.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, IT'S
THE CONTEXT OF THE FILM

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
THAT WILL DETERMINE THE
FUNCTION OF THE FRAMING.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
OF COURSE, THESE FEATURES
OF FRAMING ARE A PART OF

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
EVERY FRAMED IMAGE.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
PAINTINGS, PHOTOGRAPHS,
SKETCHES AND CARTOONS

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
ARE ALL FRAMED IN
RELATION TO HEIGHT,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
LEVEL AND DISTANCE.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
SPECIFIC TO FILM AND
TO TELEVISION, HOWEVER,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
IS THE FRAME'S MOBILITY.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
THE FRAME'S MOBILITY
IS USUALLY CALLED

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
"CAMERA MOVEMENT", AND THE
THREE MOST COMMON TYPES

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
OF CAMERA MOVEMENTS
ARE TRACKING SHOTS,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
PANS AND TILTS.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:43.000
(PHONE RINGS)

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
HELLO.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
HI JUDE, IT'S FRANK.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
OH, HI.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
HAVE YOU SEEN MY
 HEADPHONES ANYWHERE?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
YUP, THEY'RE RIGHT
HERE ON YOUR DESK.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
I'M LOOKING AT
THEM RIGHT NOW.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
DAMN.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
OKAY, I MIGHT POP IN
 LATER ON TO PICK THEM UP.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
OKAY, BYE.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
A TRACKING SHOT OCCURS
WHEN THE CAMERA TRAVELS

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
IN ONE SMOOTH MOVEMENT
IN ANY DIRECTION -

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
USUALLY ON A SET OF
TRACKS CALLED A DOLLY.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
ANOTHER COMMON CAMERA
MOVEMENT IS A PAN.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
A PAN GIVES THE IMPRESSION
THAT THE FRAME IS

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
HORIZONTALLY
SCANNING SPACE.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
THIS IS WHERE THE CAMERA
MOVES FROM SIDE TO SIDE

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
FROM A FIXED POSITION.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
THIS TECHNIQUE CAN BE USED
TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
THAT THE CHARACTER
IS SCANNING THE ROOM

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
WITH HIS OR HER EYES.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
A TILT IS A CAMERA
MOVEMENT THAT IS ALSO

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
FROM A FIXED POSITION,
BUT IN THIS CASE

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:47.000
THE CAMERA MOVES
UP OR DOWN.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
THESE MOVEMENTS CAN
HELP THE FILMMAKER DRAW

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:57.000
ATTENTION TO PARTICULAR
OBJECTS IN THE FRAME.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
(LOUD NOISE)

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
WHICH BRINGS
US TO EDITING.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
ONCE YOU BECOME
AWARE OF EDITING,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
IT'S EASY TO NOTICE.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
FILM AND TELEVISION
PROGRAMS RARELY USE ONE

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
CONTINUOUS SHOT; RATHER,
THEY'RE A SERIES OF SHOTS

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
STRUNG TOGETHER.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
BUT THE REASON WE
SOMETIMES FORGET

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
ABOUT EDITING IS BECAUSE
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
IT EXISTS AS A
FORM OF DISGUISE.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
THIS IS CALLED
CONTINUITY EDITING.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
(SOUND OF SOMEONE
TRYING TO OPEN DOOR)

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
CONTINUITY EDITING
IS VERY IMPORTANT.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
IT'S ABOUT RELATING
IMAGES IN A KIND OF

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
A LOGICAL SEQUENCE.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
FOR EXAMPLE, THERE'S
NO POINT CUTTING FROM...

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
WE MIGHT START WITH A
CLASSIC ESTABLISHING SHOT

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
- THE ESTABLISHING
SHOT OF THE HOUSE.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
NOW IF WE CUT FROM A
HOUSE TO A SPACESHIP,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
THAT'S ILLOGICAL.
WE'RE NOT EXPECTING THAT.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLES
OF CONTINUITY EDITING,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
WE WOULDN'T DO
THAT KIND OF EDITING.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
CONTINUITY EDITING IS
SOMETIMES BROKEN UP,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
THAT PRINCIPLE OF
CONTINUITY IS DESTROYED

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
TO GIVE US AN EFFECT,
PERHAPS TO HEIGHTEN

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
THE IDEA OF UNCERTAINTY,
THE IDEA OF DISCOMFORT

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
IN THE SPECTATOR
WATCHING THE FILM.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
THERE ARE OTHER TECHNIQUES
USED BY FILM EDITORS

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
TO ENSURE CONTINUITY.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
THESE INCLUDE THE EYE
LINE MATCH: WHERE WE ARE

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
SHOWN SOMEONE LOOKING OFF
SCREEN AND THEN SHOWN

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
WHAT IS BEING LOOKED AT.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
THE SHOT REVERSE SHOT
PATTERN: WHICH IS COMMONLY

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
USED IN CONVERSATIONS
BETWEEN CHARACTERS.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
AND THE MATCH ON ACTION:
AN EDITING DEVICE WHERE

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
MOVEMENT IS CARRIED ACROSS
THE BREAK IN THE SHOTS.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
EDITING, THE NARRATIVE,
MISE-EN-SCENE AND

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
CAMERA ANGLES ARE ALL
IMPORTANT ELEMENTS IN

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
UNDERSTANDING THE LANGUAGE
OF FILM AND TELEVISION.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
(FOOTSTEPS)

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
AND THE GREATER WE
UNDERSTAND THESE ELEMENTS,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
THE GREATER WE CAN
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE SEE

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
ON THE SCREEN.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
WHO WAS THAT?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
WHO DO YOU
THINK IT WAS?

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
I DON'T KNOW,
THAT KILLER DUDE?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
LOOK WHAT HE
DID TO MY CAR!

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
SO HOPEFULLY THAT GIVES YOU
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
- HOW FILM AND TELEVISION'S
UNIQUE LANGUAGE

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
MAKES MEANING.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
AND REMEMBER, IF IT'S A
HORROR FILM, YOU PROBABLY

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
HAVEN'T SEEN THE
LAST OF THE KILLER.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
THEY'RE NOT THAT
EASY TO GET RID OF.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
FRANK!

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
SORRY.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:44.000

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:57.000

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:06.000
