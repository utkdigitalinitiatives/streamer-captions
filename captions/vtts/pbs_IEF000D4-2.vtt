00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.130
KINGSLEY:
In the city of Istanbul

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.930
the soaring domes and minarets

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.500
reveal the culmination
of a thousand years

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.960
of empire and faith.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.660
Here, in the 16th century

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.060
Islam would be transformed

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.300
into a world power,
ambitious and imperial.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.330
Led by a dynasty of conquerors

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.430
their absolute authority
would establish a Muslim domain

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.430
more far-reaching
than any that had come before.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.000
(<i> explosion</i> )

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.930
KINGSLEY:
They would take their empire
to the very gates of Europe

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.630
inspired
by their greatest leader

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.860
Suleyman the Magnificent.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.030
It was an age of regal splendor

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.500
when Islam
and the great Ottoman Empire

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.700
would rise
to stake their boldest claim

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.760
for power, for conquest,
for destiny.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.400
The Ottoman Turks began
as a nomadic people

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.400
from the Steppe
beyond the Aral Sea.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.860
For centuries, they had wandered
present-day Turkey

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.460
looking for new pasturelands.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.330
(<i> horse neighing</i> )

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.500
Muslim sultans had enlisted them
as mercenaries

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.260
to fight off the Mongol hordes.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.060
But in the upheaval
following the Mongol invasion

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.360
the Turks began to stake out
their own territorial claims.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.400
From their ranks emerged
a warlord of legendary ambition.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.730
His name was Osman Bey.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.500
It's said that Osman had
a miraculous dream

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.560
of a magical tree
whose many branches

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.530
foretold his siring
a powerful lineage.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.200
ATIL:
One wonders
how much of it is truth

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.930
how much of it is legend.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.860
It makes a lovely story

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.330
and miracles are always more
easy to digest than reality.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.930
I don't think he realized

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.360
that he was setting up
such a fantastic dynasty

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.260
a dynasty that was to rule
the crucial link

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.860
between three continents.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.100
KINGSLEY:
The followers of Osman
became known as Ottomans.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.730
They considered themselves
warriors for the faith

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.230
or<i> ghazis,</i> whose destiny was
to bring Islam to the world.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.130
ATIL:
<i> Ghazis</i> were somewhat
 like free-lancers

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.660
who moved the empire forward

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.830
either for ideology, theology

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.700
or for the sake
of pure conquest.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.000
They were, probably, very brave.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.630
Never thought about themselves

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.660
or any harm
that could come to the group

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.800
by going
into dangerous conditions

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.900
but it made the Ottoman Empire
almost fearless

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.500
going into regions that nobody
had been there before.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.700
KINGSLEY:
For the early Ottomans

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.230
the direction of expansion
would always be to the west

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.960
for good reason.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.630
ATIL:
They could not expand
to the east or to the south

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.560
because those were controlled
by their brothers

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.160
the Turkmen emirs, the Muslims

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.260
and a Muslim should not be
fighting against a Muslim.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.460
So they said at the time.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.660
So the only place
you could expand

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.560
was towards
the Christian territories

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.200
westward.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.200
KINGSLEY:
Osman's warriors moved
to the north and west

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.360
across the Anatolian plateau

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.760
into territory controlled

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.230
by the traditional Christian
power in the area

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.960
the aging Byzantine Empire.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.660
By Osman's time

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.200
the thousand-year-old
Byzantine Empire

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.200
was reaching the end of its age

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.530
dwindling to an isolated
stronghold in Eurasia.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.060
The crusaders had already
wreaked havoc across the region

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.760
on their way to Jerusalem

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.530
sacking the capital city

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.900
and helping to reduce
the once-proud Byzantine empire

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.330
to a few small, warring states.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.900
The Ottomans quickly overran

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.030
these splintered Byzantine
factions

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.260
uniting northwestern Anatolia
into a single domain.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:29.630
In 1326, the Ottomans took the
powerful Byzantine city of Bursa

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.930
a victory that would change

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.400
the character
of the Ottoman Turks forever.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.000
ATIL:
The most important part
of Bursa

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.960
was that it enabled Osman
and his descendants

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.630
to establish a seat
of the government.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.160
KINGSLEY:
The restless nomads
of the Steppe

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.830
would settle down
to build an empire.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.160
HOLBROOK:
What we're witnessing

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.800
is this huge demographic event:

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.600
the movement
of a whole civilization

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.400
from a nomadic way of life
to a settled way of life.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.860
(<i> men coughing</i> )

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.930
HOLBROOK:
Now, when the Ottomans
took Bursa

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.030
and set it up as their capital

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.660
they were very concerned
to establish themselves

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.300
as the rightful standard bearers

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.230
of Muslim civilization.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.400
KINGSLEY:
Civilization meant organization

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.930
and the Ottomans set out
to manage

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.960
the vast regions
they now controlled.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.460
Leaving the Byzantine clerks
in place

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.630
they began to organize
the new empire.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.260
First and foremost

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.860
taxation and record keeping.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.160
The word "bureaucracy"

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.760
has since lost
its noble connotations

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.260
yet this was a great innovation

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.300
as ambitious
as any triumph in battle.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.760
HOLBROOK:
The Ottomans are known

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.030
for including and synthesizing
the cultural elements

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.200
through the lands
that they passed.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.730
They are known
for creating structures

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.260
by which the peoples
who lived there before

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.330
could carry on their lives
and their beliefs

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.860
in the way that they chose.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.060
KINGSLEY:
In fact, the Ottomans had
fewer conflicts

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.800
with their Christian subjects

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.200
than those of their own faith--

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.100
Muslim adversaries intent
on challenging Ottoman rule.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.300
HOLBROOK:
One of the bureaucratic...

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.430
or, let us say, management
problems facing the Ottomans

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.100
was that there were still
rival Muslim...

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.430
sort of proto-kingdoms
around them.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.430
I mean, they were conquered
by the Ottomans

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.060
but they had old grudges to bear

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.160
and they had certain claims
to dynastic glory of their own

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.960
and they were constantly worried

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.060
about these old Muslim families
rising up

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.060
and creating a rebellion.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.260
And so, the story goes

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.160
that they felt
it would be imprudent

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.960
to have the army made up
of these sorts of people.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.130
And so, they wanted
to recruit children

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:37.060
who were not connected
with any rival Muslim family.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.500
And so, they went
into the Balkans

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:44.060
and they recruited, primarily,
Christian children.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.160
KINGSLEY:
This practice was called
<i> devsirme.</i>

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.330
The young boys were, technically

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.060
slaves of the sultan

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.730
but they weren't treated
like slaves.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.700
First, they were brought
into the Muslim faith

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.660
taught rituals
of washing and prayer

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.760
and the Arabic and Ottoman
languages.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.700
This served a political,
as well as a religious, purpose.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.460
Through the<i> devsirme</i> system

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.060
the Ottomans could create
a caste

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.030
without any conflicting
loyalties to tribe or family.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.100
ATIL:
The children had
such great future

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.760
that a lot of the times,
Turks or even Muslims

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.460
pretended that their children
were Christian-born

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.360
and would register them
with the<i> devsirme</i> officials.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.860
The system was so beautiful

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.730
in that they only had
one allegiance: to the sultan.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.160
No family, no region,
no other ties.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.200
These children were then given

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.430
the best possible education
available.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.830
In the world, perhaps,
at the time.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.330
And they were then able

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.000
to move into the highest
positions of power

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.500
in the empire.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.730
ATIL:
Those who were brainy
went to the palace schools

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:14.630
and graduated into different
levels of viziers and governors.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.560
Even became, uh,<i> grand</i> viziers.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.900
Those who were brawny went
to the Janissary corps.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:31.630
KINGSLEY:
The Janissaries were
the sultan's elite infantry.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.600
It was an army
that would set the standard

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.800
for centuries to come.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.360
ATIL:
They were the strongest.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.360
Trained as military machines.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.760
No fear of dying.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.500
Totally fearless.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.300
And their only love was
to serve the sultan.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.030
KINGSLEY:
They were trained

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.460
with all the precision
and discipline

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.160
pomp and circumstance

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.300
of a modern army.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.660
For the first time
an army wore uniforms

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.030
and went into battle

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.860
to the accompaniment
of a military band.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.900
The Janissaries
were the most feared troops

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.760
in the Western world

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.160
a force that was worthy
of this new Islamic empire

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.330
and its restless visions
of conquest.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.000
By the middle
of the 15th century

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.400
the Ottoman Empire spread

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.460
from present-day Turkey,
known as Anatolia

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.530
deep into the Balkans

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.060
with one critical exception.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.700
DENNY:
It must have galled
the Ottoman sultan

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.130
that with his domains
now stretching

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.830
all the way into Asia

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.460
and far, far into Europe
in the West

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.800
there remained, right
in the center of his domains

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.760
the greatest prize of all

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.600
the capital city
of Constantinople

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.860
the most powerful, the richest,
the most magnetic city

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.160
in the entire world

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.360
still in the hands of the dying,
but not yet dead

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.430
Byzantine Empire.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.730
KINGSLEY:
To the Ottomans

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:10.930
Constantinople's strategic
and economic importance

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.630
was considerable.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:18.030
Its symbolic significance
was even greater.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.300
HOLBROOK:
It was<i> the</i> city.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.500
There was no other city.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.230
If you were going to rule
that area

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.860
obviously, you would rule it
from that city.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:34.560
KINGSLEY:
It's said that the goal of
laying claim to Constantinople

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.800
was decreed my Muhammad himself.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.400
Every Ottoman ruler since Osman
had wanted to seize the city

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.200
but it had always remained
firmly in Christian hands.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.460
Then a sultan came to power

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.600
whose dreams of conquest
would not be denied.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.560
History would honor him
as Mehmet the Conquerer.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.330
When he assumed the sultanate,
he was only 12 years old

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.230
but he was already well versed
in Ottoman politics.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:18.530
To remove any threat
of competition for power

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.830
he had his half-brother
strangled.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.030
ATIL:
The empire always meant
everything

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.030
more so than the family.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:31.960
In order to stop the empire
from splitting, as had happened

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.260
to other Turkish dynasties
ruling the Islamic world

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:41.200
when a young man became sultan
upon the death of his father

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.860
all the other brothers had to be
eliminated.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.360
This prevented segmentation
of the empire.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.630
It may have been cruel,
but it worked for the Ottomans.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.600
When, on the death of his father

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.900
he finally then took over,
it meant an enormous change

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.900
in the policy and direction
of the Ottoman Empire

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.600
in the direction
of a much greater energy.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.360
KINGSLEY:
Mehmet immediately set
his sights

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.160
on the one prize
as grand as his ambitions.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.000
ATIL:
Mehmet had to conquer
Constantinople.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.760
There was no other choice.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.800
Constantinople was sitting
like a perfect gem

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.600
or a perfect fruit
waiting to be picked.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.160
KINGSLEY:
By the middle
of the 15th century

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.860
the city was a shadow
of its former self.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:34.860
The population had plummeted
from 400,000 to a mere 50,000.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:39.360
But a besieging army would still
be at a tremendous disadvantage.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.130
Constantinople was surrounded
on three sides by water

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.300
and massively fortified.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:55.030
It was encircled
by a triple ring of walls

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.560
nearly 100 feet high
and 30 feet thick.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.100
And they had already stood
for a thousand years.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:10.500
But Mehmet had an answer
for these walls.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:14.030
KARAMUSTAFA:
And part of the military
superiority of the Ottomans

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:18.030
came from their sophisticated
and diverse use

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:21.060
of the possibilities
of gunpowder.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:26.460
The siege of Constantinople
in 1453

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.600
under Mehmet the Conquerer

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.000
saw the first dramatic
application of this

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.660
in the form of huge cannons
that had not been seen before

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.100
which Mehmet had specially
commissioned for the occasion.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.430
KINGSLEY:
Earlier cannons had been
assembled

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.300
with strips of forged metal
bound with hoops.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.360
They fired stone projectiles

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.500
with little more power
than a catapult.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.900
A new breed of cannons could be
cast of solid bronze

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.360
and packed with enough gunpowder

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.030
to propel metal cannonballs
with staggering force.

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:15.800
But Mehmet was not staking
his hopes on cannon alone.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.930
The mile-wide channel
of the Bosphorus Strait

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.560
was all that connected the city
to the Black Sea.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.460
If he could cut it off

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.630
Constantinople would be
at his mercy.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.630
Mehmet needed to construct

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.600
a strategically positioned
fortress to close the strait.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:47.400
He built it right in the shadow
of the great city walls.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.800
It took less than four months

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.300
to build a massive seven-tower
citadel called Rumeli Hisar.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.760
Mehmet himself is said
to have carried stones

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.430
during its construction.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:17.100
No sooner was it completed
than he tightened his noose

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.300
round the neck
of the Bosphorus.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.660
The first ship to defy
his orders to stop was sunk

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.300
its crew decapitated

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.830
and its captain impaled
on the castle walls.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.730
To stop Mehmet's ships
from approaching

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:45.560
the Byzantine strung a massive
chain across the strait.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:54.300
On April 22, 1453, the besieged
city watched in horror

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.860
as Mehmet's troops hoisted
70 of his ships ashore

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.900
sliding them over land
on greased planks

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.660
past the barrier chain.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.430
More than 100,000 Ottoman
soldiers now stood

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.900
before the walls
of Constantinople

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.330
braced for the greatest
bombardment

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.060
the history of warfare
had ever known.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.500
(<i> cannon fires</i> )

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.560
Under relentless fire

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.160
the city's 7,000 Christian
defenders held out

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.560
for nearly a month.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.330
In desperation, the Byzantines
who occupied the city appealed

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:41.900
to their fellow Christians
across the continent for help.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.860
DENNY:
But, of course,
Europe in the 15th century

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.960
was completely incapable
of mounting

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.930
any kind of a concerted
opposition

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.360
to the rising Turkish threat
in the east.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.200
KINGSLEY:
At that time,
the kings of Europe had

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.730
military and political problems
of their own.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.960
Constantinople would have
to fend for itself.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.160
Shortly before dawn
on May 29, 1453

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.700
the Turkish army breached
the walls of the city.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:26.400
Within hours, Constantinople was
in the hands of the Ottomans.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.760
Mehmet rode into the city

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.430
and went straight to its most
celebrated prize

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.500
the magnificent church
of Hagia Sophia.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.000
Built by the Emperor Justinian
in the sixth century

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.700
its name meant
"The Church of Holy Wisdom."

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.730
It was the largest
enclosed space in the world.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.400
HOLBROOK:
Surely, other groups of Muslims
and the Ottomans themselves

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.330
had come across many,
many churches.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.830
They had seen churches before.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.830
But they had never
seen anything...

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.930
Nobody had seen anything
like Hagia Sophia.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:12.800
ATIL:
The Hagia Sophia--

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.900
or<i> Hagia Sophia,</i>
as it's called in Turkish--

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.600
was one of the marvels
of architecture

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.200
marvels of the world.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.600
It had the largest
and highest dome in history.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.930
And it was beautifully
embellished with gold mosaics

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:30.660
and, uh, the space is
incredible.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:39.160
For Mehmet, it was
a great, uh... booty.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.660
KINGSLEY:
Inside the church
a Turkish voice rose

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.260
proclaiming in Arabic
the first pillar of Islam:

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.130
"There is no god but God.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.260
Muhammad is his messenger."

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:58.300
MAN (<i> chanting</i> ):
<i> Bismillah al-rahman al-rahim...</i>

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:05.130
KINGSLEY:
The single greatest church in
Christendom was now a mosque.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:09.700
(<i> man continues chanting
 in Arabic</i> )

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:37.660
KINGSLEY:
The Hagia Sophia became
the inspiration

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.630
for all Ottoman domed mosques
to come

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:44.260
but none would ever match
its size and scope.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.460
And it belonged
to Mehmet the Conquerer.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.930
News of his triumph sent
shock waves around the world.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.030
DENNY:
For Europeans, it was
a concomitant disaster.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:02.800
Constantinople was, after all,
the new Rome.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.100
It was Constantine's
capital city.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.730
It was the symbol of Christian
dominance in the East.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.830
KINGSLEY:
The Ottoman rulers had
long stacked up titles

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.060
for themselves:

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:22.160
<i>khan,</i> which is
 Turkish for "emperor"

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.660
<i>shahenshah,</i>
 Persian for "king of kings"

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.500
and<i> sultan,</i> the Arabic word
for "ruler."

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.960
But now, with all
the former Byzantine Empire

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.660
under their command

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.530
Mehmet and his successors
claimed yet another title--

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:45.860
Holy Roman Emperor.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.300
The Ottomans had reached
the gates of the West

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.560
and were poised to push on

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.200
towards what they now claimed
as their ultimate destiny--

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.260
the conquest of Europe.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:03.060
That quest would fall to the
most legendary sultan of all.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.660
He was born at the beginning
of the tenth century

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.260
by the Muslim calendar

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:14.160
and he was the tenth sultan
descended from Osman.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.660
He was a child of destiny
whose greatness was expected.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.960
In the parlance of the day
he was the Sahib Qur'an

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.800
the Universal Ruler, the master
of an auspicious conjunction

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.800
whose coming has been foretold

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.960
whose identity is confirmed
astrologically.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.800
KINGSLEY:
His name was Suleyman

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:39.500
after Solomon, the wise king
of the Old Testament.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.730
The Ottoman Empire would reach
its apex under Suleyman's reign.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:47.700
ATIL:
Suleyman was extremely
well educated.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.830
He was trained to the sultanate
from the day he was born.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:55.330
KINGSLEY:
As a young prince,
he formed a relationship

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.530
that would have a tremendous
impact on his life

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.260
and on the empire as well.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.130
ATIL:
When he was still
a crown prince

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:08.630
he also developed a great
friendship with a convert

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:13.200
a Greek convert
who took the name Ibrahim.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.660
FLEISCHER:
The two were very close in age

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:21.000
and apparently very close
in other ways:

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.230
personally, intellectually

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:26.830
uh, educated together
to a certain extent.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:32.300
And as was common practice, when
Suleyman acceded to the throne

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.530
on the death of his father

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:39.700
he took his faithful Ibrahim
with him to Istanbul.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:45.030
KINGSLEY:
Suleyman was 26
when he took the throne

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:48.200
determined to make his mark
on the world

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:52.330
as soon as his ministers
would let him.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:56.860
FLEISCHER:
In his early years, Suleyman
had to contend, for example

00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:01.160
with grand viziers and generals
who simply refused to obey him

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.860
feeling, apparently, that
here was a 26-year-old kid

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.330
who had never seen very much
in the way of action

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.200
and hadn't done very much

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.630
to show that people ought to,
in fact, obey him.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:20.330
KINGSLEY:
The way to prove his mettle was
on the battlefield.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.730
Every new sultan was expected
to begin his reign

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:25.500
by expanding the empire.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:31.530
Ottomans now controlled
Kurdistan, Egypt

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:37.000
and the holiest cities of Islam,
Mecca and Medina.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.500
Suleyman set his sights
on Belgrade in Hungary

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.730
the stepping-stone to Europe.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.630
ATIL:
He was the head
of the Ottoman dynasty

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.700
and he had certain duties
to perform.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.800
One was conquest.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.430
And the first task Suleyman took
upon himself

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.960
a year after he ascended
the Ottoman throne

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.230
was to head towards Belgrade
and capture it.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:07.030
Belgrade was very important
strategically

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:11.300
because it was from there the
army could move further on west.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.430
KINGSLEY:
A year later

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:18.700
he turned his ambitions
on the island of Rhodes.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.530
The tiny island was

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.600
a troublesome outpost
of Christianity

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.060
in an otherwise Ottoman sea.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:34.360
It was also a haven for pirates
preying on Muslim trade ships.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.500
The 50,000 defenders of Rhodes

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.500
manned one of the strongest
forts in the world.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.400
Suleyman decided on a tactic

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.330
other than relying
on gunfire from his huge cannons

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:57.800
a new tactic
seldom used until that time.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:05.260
KARAMUSTAFA:
The Ottomans are the first major
force to actually develop

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.700
new ways of harnessing gunpowder

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:14.160
to the cause of military
expansion in creative ways.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.360
KINGSLEY:
Ottoman sappers dug out
a series of 50 tunnels

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.030
near the base of the fort

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:23.230
so they could mine
its foundations.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.500
Performing this dangerous work

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:33.000
were expendable Christian
conscripts from the Balkans.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.830
(<i> loud explosion</i> )

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.800
The resulting explosion signaled

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.760
a furious six-hour
Ottoman assault.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.330
But the Turks were beaten back.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.600
Then, after 145 days of siege

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.800
the exhausted
Christian defenders

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.860
finally negotiated a truce.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.430
The Ottomans had won.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:12.500
Victory did more than deliver
Rhodes to the empire.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:16.260
Suleyman was now a sultan
to be taken seriously.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.760
His march of conquest had begun.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.860
Europe grew to fear
the name of Suleyman.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:40.500
But within his own borders
he had another reputation.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:46.260
Islamic history remembers him
as Kanun, the Lawgiver.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.160
ATIL:
Ottomans were really bureaucrats

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:55.100
in the full sense of the word--
they kept every single record.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.660
And in order to control
the different peoples

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:02.260
who participated in the world
of the Ottomans

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:07.500
they had to have very carefully
sorted out legal systems.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.230
KINGSLEY:
Under Suleyman, a single
legal system was defined

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.760
for the sprawling empire.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:21.460
His laws would later become
the basis of constitutions

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.400
for several other nations.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.130
Well, Suleyman was the supreme
monarch of the area.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:28.560
He was the center of the world.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.300
KINGSLEY:
He inaugurated a classical age
in Ottoman architecture

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.530
commissioning some of
the most spectacular buildings

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:42.060
the world has ever seen.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:50.900
HOLBROOK:
Suleyman was in a unique
position of wealth

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:54.500
and of consolidation,
and he focused his attention

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.230
on developing
monumental architecture

00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:00.660
to commemorate
his great dynasty and himself.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:05.660
RENARD:
Great religious architecture
can really give people a sense

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.460
of what is at the heart
of the faith.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.700
Grandeur and majesty are
the things that come to mind

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.600
when Muslims think about God.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.860
A building that
is grand and majestic

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.000
can immediately remind people
of the glory of God.

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.960
KINGSLEY:
Suleyman's chief architect,
Sinan, was a man

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.860
whose vision perfectly
complemented the empire builder.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:34.260
Sinan perfected the signature
structure of Islam

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:35.830
the domed mosque.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:41.600
His career spanned
half a century

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.700
and produced
well over 300 buildings

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.130
including the refurbishment

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:51.230
of one of the most important
monuments in Islam

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:54.200
the Dome of the Rock
in Jerusalem.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:01.700
ATIL:
For the sultan, of course,
he built his masterpiece

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.560
the Suleymaniye Mosque
in Istanbul.

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:09.560
It is truly befitting Sinan,
who is called the Great Master.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:13.000
These buildings were
horrendously expensive--

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.330
huge things that took many,
many years to build

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:19.230
and a great deal of
architectural talent

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.860
and engineering skill
and engineering experience.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.060
When they built a mosque
like the Suleymaniye

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.560
they were doing it to say,
"Yeah, I've got the power.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.160
"I've got the money.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.100
I am the sultan,
I'm the king of kings."

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.660
But, at the same time

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.530
there was also tremendous
spiritual value in these things.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:40.100
The symbolism is not only that
of empire but of faith.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.230
KINGSLEY:
In the spirit
of Muhammad's teaching

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:49.700
the great mosque was
a center of social services

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.900
complete with a hospital,
school and library.

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:59.400
At its inauguration, it's said
Suleyman gazed at it with awe

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:04.000
and exclaimed, "Oh, Solomon,
I have surpassed thee."

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:16.430
No less impressive
was Suleyman's palace.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:19.000
Topkapi was both
the seat of government

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.730
and his private dwelling.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:27.900
ATIL:
Suleyman was also
a great patron of the arts.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.700
And since the empire
was very rich

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.730
the best artisans were there.

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:37.900
So everything
started flourishing.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:44.660
The architecture
or the arts of his period

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:49.100
show the first golden age
of the Ottoman world.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:59.200
Everything that came out
of his palace was exquisite.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:07.760
Suleyman himself
was a goldsmith.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.900
Ottomans believed that every
sultan had to have

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.260
a tangible trade.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.260
Being a sultan
was not considered

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.300
a practical or a tangible trade.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:22.000
And he was
a very demanding patron--

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.560
insisted on checking the work.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.960
He even commissioned
a few things.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:31.730
And I think each artisan group,
or each corps

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:33.400
working for the palace

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.830
tried to outdo one another
to please the sultan

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:40.300
because to please him
had wonderful rewards.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:51.800
KARAMUSTAFA:
And the Ottomans, of course,
exercised quite a lot

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.330
of influence
on the European imagination

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:58.900
and the royal and the political,
if you will

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.360
ceremony and pomp
of the Ottomans

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:07.360
was such that it would have
humbled, um, any citizen

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.760
of the known world then.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.530
This was arguably one of
<i> the</i> greatest world empires

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:16.730
and European observers
could not walk away

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:20.000
without feeling of respect
for the sheer power

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.930
of the Ottomans.

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:29.500
KINGSLEY:
In public, Suleyman required
that all those around him

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:33.300
remain completely silent
while he made his wishes known

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.660
with the slightest nod
or gesture.

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:39.760
FLEISCHER:
It must have been
a tremendously impressive sight

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.100
to see the courtyard
of the palace

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.100
filled with
some 6,000 or 7,000 Janissaries

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:48.330
and other functionaries--
no one saying a word.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:56.660
What's going on here was
the creation of a sovereignty

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:00.700
so mysterious
and yet so far-reaching

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.160
as to be seen as nearly divine.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:11.230
KINGSLEY:
As Suleyman's power grew

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:15.700
his lifelong friend, Ibrahim,
rose in the court structure.

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:20.630
ATIL:
And Ibrahim Pasha--
who became a pasha later on--

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.830
became his devoted grand vizier.

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:26.100
In fact, Ibrahim
married his sister.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.860
So, they were not only good
friends, they were also related.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.030
KINGSLEY:
Ibrahim campaigned
with his own army

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.230
growing in influence
and ambition

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:43.260
till his power
was second only to Suleyman's.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.630
But for power and ambition

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:56.130
the secret world of the sultan's
harem had no equal.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.660
Contrary
to the Western stereotype

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.200
it was not the sultan's playpen

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.460
but lay at the center
of dynastic power.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.100
HOLBROOK:
The harem was the private
quarters of the sultan.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.000
We tend to think of the harem
as where the women live.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.160
But what it means is "the place
where you're not on display."

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.100
"Home" is what it means.

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:32.230
KINGSLEY:
Islam allowed the sultan
four wives and many concubines.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:35.230
HOLBROOK:
It was a system designed
to produce heirs

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:37.160
is what it was.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.900
When you look into
the actual details

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.600
of how these things
were carried out

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.560
it was hardly anything
terribly erotic.

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:49.260
I mean, the sultan
did not have much choice

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.600
in his selection
of female companions.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.130
The sultan was not in a position
to look around and say

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.600
"I want her," you know

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.030
because his mother would have
a lot to say about it.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:12.930
KINGSLEY:
With his first wife, Suleyman
had a son and heir, Mustafa.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:15.630
But while he was in his mid-30s

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:20.260
the sultan fell deeply in love
with a Slavic slave girl

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:21.660
named Hurrem.

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:26.400
In the West, we know her
by a different name, Roxellana.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:31.760
Roxellana would bear him
a rival heir

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.300
and become Suleyman's
most trusted confidante.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:39.100
HOLBROOK:
The sultan was supposed
to be protected

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.230
from any undue influences.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.860
He was supposed to be protected
from any rivals.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:49.000
And, in a way, this creates
a vacuum around his person

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.730
into which the harem life
can enter.

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:56.730
And so the fact
that he was so protected

00:38:56.730 --> 00:39:00.630
works in a funny way
to expose him to the influence

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:05.400
of his female companions, with
whom he spends so much time.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.800
And there were
tremendously intelligent

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.560
and ambitious women around him--

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.730
Roxellana being
the most famous of all.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:19.930
DENNY:
Suleyman is
a complex character--

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:22.660
a man that we
know from his own life

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.000
was capable of
the tenderest emotions

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.930
both toward his male friends

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:30.630
and especially toward, uh,
the great love of his life

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:34.360
his wife, Hurrem Sultan,
and toward his family as well.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.200
He had a number
of extremely talented sons

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.330
on whom he lavished
a great deal of affection.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.260
KINGSLEY:
Suleyman groomed his firstborn
son, Mustafa, for power.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.130
In the Ottoman tradition

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.160
the young prince
entered the military

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.960
and quickly won recognition
as a talented general.

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.900
Mustafa was clearly
the heir apparent.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:05.800
For Suleyman, the future
of his empire seemed limitless.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:13.230
"I am God's slave
and sultan of this world"

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:17.630
Suleyman would carve
on a conquered fortress.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:20.500
"I am Suleyman, in whose name

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:25.060
"the Friday sermon
is read in Mecca and Medina.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.560
"In Baghdad, I am the shah

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:31.460
"in the Byzantine realms,
I am the Caesar

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.700
and in Egypt, the sultan."

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:39.100
KARAMUSTAFA:
He, of course,
at the height of his powers

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:42.230
clearly saw himself
as dwarfing all his rivals...

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:43.860
perhaps rightly so.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.960
KINGSLEY:
One of Suleyman's
greatest rivals

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:55.930
was to the east, the empire
of the Persian Safavids.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.460
This was a Muslim enemy
whose rival creed

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:02.130
made them fierce antagonists
of the Ottomans for centuries.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:10.760
HOLBROOK:
The Safavids were also Turkic
in their ethnic origins

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:15.700
and, indeed, spoke Turkish
as a language of daily life.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.100
But they were moving

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.700
into the Muslim world--

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.230
unlike the Ottomans,
who were moving into the West.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:29.230
ATIL:
So, for the Ottoman Empire, they
formed, sort of, the boundaries

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:32.830
the easternmost boundaries
of the Ottoman realm.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.730
KINGSLEY:
The Safavid dynasty
was Shiite Muslims--

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:44.430
bitter rivals
to the Sunni Ottomans.

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:49.030
RENARD:
According to the Shiites

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:52.200
a leader had to be designated
by his predecessor

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.830
and had to be
of the family of Muhammad.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:58.760
According to the Sunni view

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.160
it was not designation
that was necessary

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.700
and a person could be a leader
of the community

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.200
without being a direct
descendant of Muhammad.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.430
KINGSLEY:
This challenge to legitimacy

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:16.230
is the basis
of the Shiite/Sunni split--

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:18.660
a bitter division that still
separates the Muslim world

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.830
to this day.

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.600
HOLBROOK:
And I would say

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.400
the Ottomans never really
thought of themselves

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.830
so much as Sunni

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:34.330
until the Safavids came forth
as this rival Shii.

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:43.800
So the Safavis developed a rival
ideology to the Ottomans

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.700
which then became
an occasion for war

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:51.960
over, of course, what wars
are usually fought over.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.230
Wars are fought over land,
over wealth

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:56.600
over territory, over prestige.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:01.200
And the Safavis waged
a war of ideology

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.330
in eastern Anatolia

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:05.960
which was always,
for the Ottomans

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.460
the most worrisome part.

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.760
The terrain is difficult to
conquer, difficult to control.

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:18.760
KINGSLEY:
The Safavid military
rywas formidable

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.800
but they were cultural rivals
to the Ottomans, as well.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.230
ATIL:
They were great patrons
of the arts.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:29.000
I think we know them more
for their artistic patronage

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.060
than of their great conquests
and laws

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:36.530
and systems and administration.

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:37.860
When you look at Isfahan

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.960
it is the most beautiful city
in the world

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.730
and that<i> is</i> the Safavid city.

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:44.400
It's the Safavid capital.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.460
But it doesn't give you
the same sense of power

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:51.460
that the Ottoman Empire had
or the Ottoman capital had.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.200
It's a different sense of power.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.230
It's more eloquent, perhaps

00:43:55.230 --> 00:44:00.500
more precious in its decoration
and its ceremonial spaces.

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:04.330
It's a totally different aspect
of Islam.

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:09.260
Safavi art and architecture
is on a finer scale.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:12.530
It's known... it's known
for its filigree.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:17.130
It's known for its intricate
brushwork, you know

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:20.160
rather than
for its stunning scale.

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:27.800
KINGSLEY:
In the soaring palaces
of the Safavid shahs

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.030
murderous intrigues
against Suleyman

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:31.900
and his dynasty were hatched

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.460
that would reach
into his very household.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:43.000
But Suleyman's eyes
were on the West

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.730
where a fragmented
and vulnerable Europe

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:48.430
awaited his conquest.

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:50.160
The Ottoman Empire
encompassed everything

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.830
from Egypt to Kurdistan,
and he now had Hungary, as well.

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:01.560
KARAMUSTAFA:
But he had ambitions
of going beyond that

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.230
and actually bringing

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:08.130
the larger portions
of the world known to him--

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:11.630
if not all of it--
under his control.

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:17.230
KINGSLEY:
Suleyman's next step
would be Vienna.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:20.100
Its conquest would drive
a dagger into the heart

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.830
of the European Habsburg Empire
and open the way to the West.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.830
But as the heavily armed
Ottomans set out for Vienna

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:32.360
the weather turned against them.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.700
KINGSLEY:
The heavy cannon
that had swept the Ottomans

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:41.830
to victory after victory,
bogged down in the mud.

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.660
Suleyman had to move on
without them.

00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:56.200
With only light artillery

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.830
the Ottomans relentlessly
shelled the city

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:03.430
but the smallest breach
was ferociously defended.

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:08.800
After a lengthy siege
with winter fast approaching

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.860
Suleyman withdrew his forces.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:14.700
He was not concerned.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:18.130
He was sure he would return
soon enough.

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:21.300
He never did.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:25.300
HOLBROOK:
Suleyman's failure to take
Vienna was pivotal for Europe.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:31.230
It was the first major defeat
after a long time.

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:34.400
The Europeans had been losing
and losing and losing.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.130
And this was the dawn
of a new day for Europe.

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:46.100
KINGSLEY:
But Suleyman had little to fear
from Europe.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.260
Rival Muslim Safavids
and his own family

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.560
would bring the cruelest
of sorrows to the sultan

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.460
and, ultimately, to his empire,
as well.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.900
DENNY:
Suleyman, in some ways

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.700
serves as a sort of epitome

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:06.430
of the 16th-century idea
of the wise and just ruler

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:09.130
who is, at the same time,
a very tragic figure.

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:17.860
KINGSLEY:
In the power-laden world
of the sultan's household

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:21.730
the intrigues never ceased.

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:25.530
ATIL:
The Topkapi Palace, as it
was originally conceived

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:27.900
had no quarters for the ladies.

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:32.830
The women lived in what
was called the Old Palace

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:35.600
but Hurrem always complained
about her husband--

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.960
as most wives would--

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:40.560
spending too many days
and months campaigning

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:43.130
outside the capital.

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:45.060
She kept saying
she feels very lonely

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:47.230
and the children miss him.

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:50.700
Well, surprisingly, there
was a fire in the Old Palace--

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.130
fire in Hurrem's quarters.

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:57.130
So she had to be moved to
the Topkapi Palace temporarily

00:47:57.130 --> 00:48:00.630
while her old quarters
were being renovated.

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:03.230
Well, she moved in
and never moved out.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:11.960
KINGSLEY:
Now, Hurrem was
at the center of power

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.400
promoting her own son
as heir apparent

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:18.860
and immersing herself in a web
of deadly gossip and suspicion.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:25.400
ATIL:
She was incredibly devoted
to her husband

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:28.430
and any threat to Suleyman
was a threat to her

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:30.660
and she had to get rid of it.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:33.830
The first, uh, threat came
from Ibrahim Pasha

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:39.330
who assumed titles
that were only given to sultans.

00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:43.700
So Hurrem knew something
was going to happen eventually

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:49.830
and to protect the empire
and the dynasty

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:51.630
Ibrahim Pasha had to go.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.460
KINGSLEY:
On March 15, 1536

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.000
Suleyman and Ibrahim Pasha
dined together

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.330
as was their custom.

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:09.060
In the morning, Ibrahim's body
was found, strangled.

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:18.500
But Suleyman's desolation
and loss had only begun.

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:29.930
A few years after
Ibrahim's death

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:31.800
Hurrem claimed
to have uncovered a plot

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.400
to overthrow Suleyman

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.230
devised with Safavid help

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:38.660
by his beloved first-born
son and heir, Mustafa.

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:44.930
KARAMUSTAFA:
This is a continuous problem
in Ottoman history--

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:49.760
sons trying to eventually
replace their father.

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.800
This happens in monarchies.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.430
Succession could
become a problem

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:58.800
and it was an acute problem
and Suleyman had his share of it

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:01.900
and perhaps did not always
play his hands right.

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:10.530
KINGSLEY:
Without hesitation, Suleyman
ordered Mustafa's execution

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:13.460
then sat by the young man's body
for days

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:16.200
refusing to allow anyone
to touch him.

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:22.160
The best hope for
the empire's future was dead.

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:30.000
When Hurrem herself died
the following year

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.700
Suleyman fell deeper
into despair

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:35.830
finding solace in his poetry.

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:38.730
ATIL:
Most of the poetry, I think,
was written

00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:40.260
after he lost his wife

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:44.130
since he talks about the
loneliness of being in office

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:48.800
that he has nobody left anymore
and he's dying to join her.

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:54.960
KINGSLEY:
"Even if your reign
on the imperial throne

00:50:54.960 --> 00:51:00.730
"seems everlasting,
don't be taken in.

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:04.030
"One day, a hostile wind
will blow

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:06.460
"and bring to your land
of beauty

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:09.730
heaven's misfortune
and deepest suffering."

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:16.660
In all his loneliness, there was
only one refuge for the sultan

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.760
whose power, like his sorrow,
seemed limitless.

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:24.600
He returned to the field
of battle

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.460
to the work of conquest.

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:31.900
ATIL:
He personally led 13 campaigns.

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:36.800
The last one was at Szigetvar,
which is in Hungary now.

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:46.030
I think he knew that this was
going to be his last campaign.

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:47.430
He personally led it

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:52.130
knowing that he would
not come back alive.

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:58.000
KINGSLEY:
In 1561, the man who had ruled
the empire longer than any other

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.100
died in his grand war pavilion,
surrounded by his generals.

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:04.730
He was 67.

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:10.560
No Ottoman sultan would ever
achieve his greatness again.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:14.060
The nexus of world power would
move from the Mediterranean Sea

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:16.700
to the Atlantic Ocean
and the New World

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:19.200
slowly leaving
the Ottomans behind.

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:42.230
In Istanbul today,
the Sufi dervishes still turn

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:45.900
with the same prayerful
pirouettes they danced

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:47.400
in Suleyman's day.

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.630
It is a meditation in motion

00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:52.830
whose mystic origins
go back even further

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:55.630
to the time
of the prophet Muhammad.

00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:01.560
"You have become
the best community

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:07.530
ever raised up in mankind," the
Qur'an assures all believers

00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:11.230
"enjoining the right
and forbidding the wrong

00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:13.300
and having faith in God."

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:21.500
Islamic and Western civilization
have the same roots:

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:25.630
their dawning
in the Fertile Crescent;

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:30.130
the monotheism of the Jews
and Christians;

00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:34.360
the classical, intellectual
culture of the ancient Greeks.

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:41.200
The two traditions
are kindred spirits

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.560
alike, yet very different.

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:50.000
Islam's legacy is intertwined
with the West's

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.030
and to the millions of Muslims

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:55.600
who make it the second largest
religion in the world

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:57.460
it is a living legacy...

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:03.700
an elemental part
of the great human venture

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:05.900
that is world civilization.
