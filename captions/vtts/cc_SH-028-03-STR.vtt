00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.470


2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.200


3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.330
Where's the king?

4
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.000
Contending with the fretful elements.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.670
Bids the winds blow the Earth into the sea

6
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.200
or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.770
that things might change or cease.

8
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.270
Sir, I do know you and dare,

9
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.700
upon the warrant of my note, commend a dear thing to you.

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.300
There is division, although as yet,

11
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.100
the face of it is covered with mutual cunning,

12
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.430
'twixt Albany and Cornwall.

13
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.330
But, true it is, from France, there comes a power

14
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.500
into this scattered kingdom

15
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.000
who already, wise in our negligence,

16
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.770
have secret feet in some of our best ports

17
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.930
and are at point to show their open banner.

18
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.070
Now, sir, to you.

19
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.970
If, on my credit, you dare build so far

20
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.870
to make your speed to Dover,

21
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.630
you shall find some that will thank you,

22
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.730
making just report

23
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.330
of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow

24
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.130
the king hath cause to plain.

25
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.600
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding

26
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.200
and, from some knowledge and assurance,

27
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.400
offer this office to you.

28
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.500
I will talk further with you.

29
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.070
No, do not.

30
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.000
For confirmation that I am much more than my out-wall,

31
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.530
open this purse, and take what it contains.

32
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.500
If you should see Cordelia as fear not but you shall

33
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.800
show her this ring, and she will tell you

34
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.930
who that fellow is that yet you do not know.

35
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.300
Fie on this storm.

36
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.900
I'll go seek the king.

37
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.300
Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!

38
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.930
Rage!

39
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.630
Blow!

40
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.230
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout till you have drenched

41
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.900
our steeples, drowned the cocks!

42
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.830
You sulfurous and thought-executing fires,

43
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.630
vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,

44
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.670
singe my white head!

45
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.600
And you, all-shaking thunder,

46
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.070
strike flat the thick rotundity o' the world!

47
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.730
Crack nature's molds, all germens spill at once

48
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.530
that make ingrateful man!

49
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.130
Nuncle, court holy-water in a dry house

50
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.900
is better than this rain-water out o' door.

51
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.970
Good nuncle, in.

52
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.430
Ask thy daughters' blessing.

53
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.270
Here's a night pities neither wise men nor fools.

54
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.530
Rumble thy bellyful!

55
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.430
Spit, fire! Spout, rain!

56
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.600
Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters.

57
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.100
I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.

58
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.130
I never gave you kingdom, called you children.

59
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.200
You owe me no subscription.

60
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.030
Then let fall your horrible pleasure.

61
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.330
Here I stand, your slave;

62
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.970
a poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man.

63
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.130
And yet I call you servile ministers

64
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.670
that will with two pernicious daughters

65
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.570
join your high engendered battles

66
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.070
'gainst a head so old and white as this.

67
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.900
Oh.

68
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.200
'Tis foul.

69
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.270
He that has a house to put his head in

70
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.400
has a good head-piece.

71
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.330
No.

72
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.530
I will be the pattern of all patience.

73
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.170
I will say nothing.

74
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.270
Who's there?

75
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.300
Marry, here's grace and a cod-piece.

76
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.030
That's a wise man and a fool.

77
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.070
Alas, sir, are you here?

78
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.200
Things that love night love not such nights as these.

79
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.570
The wrathful skies gallow the very wanderers of the night

80
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.530
and make them keep their caves.

81
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.770
Since I was man, such sheets of fire,

82
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.070
such bursts of horrid thunder,

83
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.000
such groans of roaring wind and rain,

84
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.530
I never remember to have heard.

85
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.530
Man's nature cannot carry the affliction nor the fear.

86
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.170
Let the great gods

87
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.570
that keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads

88
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.600
find out their enemies now.

89
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.870
Tremble, thou wretch, that hath within thee

90
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.530
undivulged crimes, unwhipped of justice.

91
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.500
Hide thee, thou bloody hand.

92
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.330
Thou perjured, and thou simular man

93
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.170
of virtue that art incestuous.

94
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.100
Caitiff, to pieces shake,

95
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.430
that under covert and convenient seeming

96
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.030
hath practiced on man's life.

97
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.700
Close pent-up guilts, rive your concealing continents,

98
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.130
and cry these dreadful summoners grace.

99
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.800
I am a man more sinned against than sinning!

100
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.700
Alack, bare-headed.

101
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.770
Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel.

102
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.530
Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.

103
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.300
Repose you there while I to this hard houseó

104
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.300
more harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised,

105
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.030
which, even but now, demanding after you,

106
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.400
denied me to come in

107
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.530
return and force their scanted courtesy.

108
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.100
My wits begin to turn.

109
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.070
Come on, my boy.

110
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.030
How dost, my boy? Art cold?

111
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.800
I am cold myself.

112
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.430
Where is this straw, my fellow?

113
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.330
The art of our necessities is strange

114
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.200
that can make vile things precious.

115
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.500
Come, your hovel.

116
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.530
Poor fool and knave,

117
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.730
I have one part in my heart that's sorry yet for thee.

118
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:47.000
He that hath and a little tiny witó

119
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.670
with a hey, ho, the wind and the rainó

120
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.970
must make content with his fortunes fit,

121
00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:01.870
for the rain, it raineth every day.

122
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.030
True, my good boy.

123
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.370
Come, bring us to your hovel.

124
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.600
This is a brave night to cool a courtesan.

125
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.000
I'll speak a prophecy ere I go.

126
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.670
When priests are more in word than matter,

127
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.130
when brewers mar their malt with water,

128
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.670
when nobles are their tailors' tutors,

129
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.000
no heretics burned but wenches' suitors,

130
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.500
then shall the realm of Albion come

131
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.870
to great confusion.

132
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.930
When every case in law is right,

133
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.430
no squire in debt nor no poor knight,

134
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.530
when slanders do not live in tongues

135
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.370
nor cutpurses come not to throngs,

136
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.100
when usurers tell their gold i' the field

137
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.130
and bawds and whores do churches build,

138
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.270
then comes the time, who lives to see 't,

139
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.200
when going shall be used with feet.

140
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.600
And this prophecy Merlin shall make,

141
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.870
for I live before his time.

142
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.330
Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing.

143
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.270
When I desire their leave that I might pity him,

144
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.970
they took from me the use of mine own house;

145
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.000
charged me, on pain of perpetual displeasure,

146
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.600
neither to speak of him, entreat for him,

147
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.400
or in any way sustain him.

148
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.600
Most savage and unnatural.

149
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.270
Go to; say you nothing.

150
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.230
There is division between the dukes

151
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.430
and a worse matter than that.

152
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.600
I have received a letter this night.

153
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.900
'Tis dangerous to be spoken.

154
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.300
I have locked the letter in my closet.

155
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.430
These injuries the king now bears

156
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.970
will be revenged home.

157
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.170
There is part of a power already footed.

158
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.130
We must incline to the king.

159
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.270
I will look him and privily relieve him.

160
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.530
Go you and maintain talk with the duke,

161
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.570
that my charity be not of him perceived.

162
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:04.130
If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed.

163
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.870
If I die for it, as no less is threatened me,

164
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.230
the king, my old master, must be relieved.

165
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.830
There are strange things toward, Edmund.

166
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.600
Pray you, be careful.

167
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:40.970
Here is the place, my lord.

168
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.000
Good my lord, enter.

169
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.670
The tyranny of the open night's too rough for nature to endure.

170
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.730
Let me alone.

171
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:47.770
Good my lord, enter here.

172
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:48.800
Wilt break my heart?

173
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.930
I had rather break mine own.

174
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.000
Good my lord, enter.

175
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.300
Thou think'st 'tis much

176
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.700
that this contentious storm invades us to the skin.

177
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.400
So 'tis to thee.

178
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.670
But where the greater malady is fixed,

179
00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.700
the lesser is scarce felt.

180
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.670
Thou'ldst shun a bear,

181
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.870
but if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea,

182
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.330
thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth.

183
00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.870
When the mind's free, the body's delicate.

184
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.930
The tempest in my mind does from my senses take all feeling

185
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.800
else save what beats there.

186
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.870
Filial ingratitude!

187
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.300
Is it not as this mouth would tear this hand

188
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.000
for lifting food to it?

189
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.930
But I will punish home.

190
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:30.000
No, I will weep no more.

191
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.270
In such a night to shut me out.

192
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.600
Pour on!

193
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.070
I will endure!

194
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.830
In such a night as this.

195
00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.130
O Regan, Goneril.

196
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.630
Thy old kind father, whose frank heart gave all

197
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.370
O, that way madness lies.

198
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.000
Let me shun that. No more of that.

199
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.600
Good my lord, enter here.

200
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.330
Prithee, go in thyself.

201
00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.200
Take thine own ease.

202
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.470
This tempest will not give me leave

203
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.500
to ponder on things would hurt me more.

204
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.170
But I'll go in.

205
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:16.270
In, boy. Go first.

206
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:23.730
You houseless poverty

207
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.600
nay, get thee in.

208
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.070
I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.

209
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:39.230
Poor naked wretches, whereso'er you are,

210
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.630
that bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,

211
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:48.870
how shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,

212
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.670
your looped and windowed raggedness

213
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:56.770
defend you from seasons such as these?

214
00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:04.300
O, I have ta'en too little care of this.

215
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:08.000
Take physic, pomp.

216
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.130
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel

217
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:17.600
that thou mayest shake the superflux to them

218
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.430
and show the heavens more just.

219
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.270
Fathom and a half, fathom and a half!

220
00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.030
Poor Tom!

221
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.630
Come not in here, nuncle!

222
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:26.670
Help me! Help me!

223
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.000
Give me thy hand.

224
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.270
Who's there?

225
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.730
A spirit; he says his name's poor Tom.

226
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.430
What art thou that dost grumble there in the straw?

227
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.130
Come forth!

228
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.870
Away!

229
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.900
The foul fiend follows me.

230
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.770
Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.

231
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.370
Ha!

232
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.770
Go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.

233
00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.370
Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?

234
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.400
And art thou come to this?

235
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.830
Who gives anything to poor Tom,

236
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.130
whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame,

237
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:54.370
through ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire,

238
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:55.900
that hath laid knives under his pillow

239
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.330
and halters in his pew,

240
00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.930
set ratsbane by his porridge, made film proud of heart

241
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.500
to ride on a bay trotting-horse over four-inched bridges,

242
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.330
to course his own shadow for a traitor.

243
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:07.530
Bless thy five wits.

244
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:08.930
Tom's a-cold.

245
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.400
Ah, do de, do de, do de.

246
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.670
Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking.

247
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.700
Do poor Tom some charity, whom the foul fiend vexes.

248
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.530
There could I have him now

249
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.770
and there, there, there, there.

250
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.200
What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?

251
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.170
Couldst thou save nothing?

252
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.600
Wouldst thou give them all?

253
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.970
Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.

254
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.000
Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air

255
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.370
hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!

256
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.330
He hath no daughters, sir.

257
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:37.700
Death, traitor!

258
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.100
Nothing could have subdued nature

259
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.230
to such a lowness but his unkind daughters.

260
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.070
Is it the fashion that discarded fathers

261
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.730
should have thus little mercy on their flesh?

262
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.170
Judicious punishment!

263
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:55.600
'Twas this flesh begot those pelican daughters.

264
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.430
This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen!

265
00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.300
Take heed o' the foul fiend. Obey thy parents.

266
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.600
Keep thy word justly. Swear not.

267
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.030
Commit not with man's sworn spouse.

268
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.770
Set not thy sweet heart on proud array.

269
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:07.070
Tom's a-cold.

270
00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.870
What hast thou been?

271
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:17.700
A serving-man, proud in heart and mind

272
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.900
that curled my hair, wore gloves in my cap,

273
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.600
served the lust of my mistress' heart

274
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.370
and did the act of darkness with her,

275
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.030
swore as many oaths as I spake words,

276
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:31.730
and broke them in the sweet face of heaven.

277
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.730
One that slept in the contriving of lust

278
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.800
and waked to do it.

279
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:43.770
Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly,

280
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.570
and in woman out-paramoured the Turk.

281
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:48.070
False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand,

282
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.000
hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness,

283
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.970
dog in madness, lion in prey.

284
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.530
Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks

285
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.200
betray thy poor heart to woman.

286
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.030
Keep thy foot out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets,

287
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.070
thy pen from lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.

288
00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.530
Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind.

289
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.600
Sing sum, mun, nonny.

290
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.230
Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa!

291
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.870
Let him trot by.

292
00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.070
Thou wert better in a grave than to answer

293
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.470
with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.

294
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.400
Is man no more than this?

295
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.000
Consider him well.

296
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.600
Thou owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide,

297
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.400
the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume.

298
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.900
Ha!

299
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.000
Here's three on 's are sophisticated.

300
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.600
Thou art the thing itself.

301
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.200
Unaccommodated man is no more

302
00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:02.630
but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art.

303
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.430
Off, off, you lendings!

304
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:07.470
Come unbutton here!

305
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.770
Be contented!

306
00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:14.370
'Tis a naughty night to swim in.

307
00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:19.200
Now a little fire in a dark field

308
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.970
were like an old lecher's heart:

309
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:26.030
a small spark, all the rest on's body cold.

310
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.070
Look, look, here comes a walking fire.

311
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.300
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet.

312
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.930
He begins at curfew and walks till the first cock.

313
00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:41.970
He gives the web and the pin, squints the eye,

314
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.400
and makes the hare-lip,

315
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.730
mildews the white wheat,

316
00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:47.200
and hurts the poor creature of Earth.

317
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.070
How fares Your Grace?

318
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.800
What's he?

319
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.330
Who's there?

320
00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.300
What is't you seek?

321
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.370
What are you there? Your names?

322
00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:59.030
Poor Tom that eats the swimming frog, the toad,

323
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.870
the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water;

324
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.530
that in the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages,

325
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.430
eats cow dung for sallets,

326
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.400
swallows the old rat and the ditch-dog,

327
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.400
drinks the green mantle of the standing pool;

328
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.900
that is whipped from tithing to tithing

329
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.530
and stock-punished, and imprisoned;

330
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.000
that hath had three suits to his back,

331
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
six shirts to his body, horse to ride,

332
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.100
and weapon to wear.

333
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.530
But mice and rats and such small deer

334
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.570
have been Tom's food for seven long year.

335
00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.370
Beware my follower.

336
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.800
Peace, Smulkin.

337
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.030
Peace, thou fiend!

338
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.900
What, hath Your Grace no better company?

339
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.800
The prince of darkness is a gentleman.

340
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:40.030
Modo he's called, and Mahu.

341
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.730
Our flesh and blood, my lord, is grown so vile,

342
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.670
that it doth hate what gets it.

343
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.070
Poor Tom's a-cold.

344
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.300
Go in with me.

345
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.270
My duty cannot suffer to obey

346
00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.030
in all your daughters' hard commands.

347
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:53.400
Though their injunction be to bar my doors,

348
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.770
yet have I ventured to come seek you out

349
00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:58.970
and bring you where both fire and food is ready.

350
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:02.770
First let me talk with this philosopher.

351
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.930
What is the cause of thunder?

352
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.530
Good my lord, take his offer.

353
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.830
Go into the house.

354
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:15.070
I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.

355
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:18.230
What is thy study?

356
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:20.600
How to prevent the foul fiend and to kill vermin.

357
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.870
Let me ask you one word in private.

358
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:25.630
Importune him once more to go, my lord.

359
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.230
His wits begin to unsettle.

360
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:28.530
Canst thou blame him?

361
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.730
His daughters seek his death.

362
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.100
Oh, that good Kent!

363
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.800
He said it would be thus, poor banished man.

364
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.170
Thou sayest the king grows mad.

365
00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.630
I'll tell thee, friend, I am almost mad myself.

366
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.630
I had a son, now outlawed from my blood.

367
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.500
He sought my life but lately, very late.

368
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.900
I loved him, friend no father his son dearer.

369
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.900
Truth to tell thee, the grief hath crazed my wits.

370
00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.530
What a night's this.

371
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.670
I do beseech Your Graceó

372
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.200
O, cry your mercy, sir.

373
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.100
Noble philosopher, your company.

374
00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.830
This way, my lord.

375
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.270
In there, fellow.

376
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.100
Good my lord, soothe him.

377
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.270
Let him take the fellow!

378
00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.130
This way! This way, fellow!

379
00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:07.470
Come along with us.

380
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.030
Come. Come.

381
00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.600
No words, no words. Hush!

382
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.330
Child Rowland to the dark tower came.

383
00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.900
His word was still, "Fie, foh, and fum,

384
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.000
I smell the blood of a British man."

385
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:31.400
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.

386
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.830
How, my lord, I may be censured,

387
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.030
that nature thus gives way to loyalty,

388
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.730
something fears me to think of.

389
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.030
I now perceive it was not altogether

390
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.500
your brother's evil disposition that made him seek his death

391
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.370
but a provoking merit set a-work

392
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.000
by a reprovable badness in himself.

393
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.070
How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to be just.

394
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.630
This is the letter he spoke of,

395
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:57.500
which approves him an intelligent party

396
00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.130
to the advantages of France.

397
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.270
O heavens, that this treason were not

398
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.370
or not I the detector.

399
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.430
Go with me to the duchess.

400
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.170
If the matter of this paper be certain,

401
00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.300
you have mighty business in hand.

402
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:16.000
True or false, it hath made thee earl of Gloucester.

403
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.900
Seek out where thy father is,

404
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.400
that he may be ready for our apprehension.

405
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.800
I will persevere in my course of loyalty,

406
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.570
though the conflict be sore between that and my blood.

407
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:29.670
I will lay trust upon thee,

408
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:34.200
and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love.

409
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.730
Here is better than the open air.

410
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.500
Take it thankfully.

411
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.530
I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can.

412
00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:40.970
I will not be long from you.

413
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.170
All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience.

414
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.470
The gods reward your kindness.

415
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:45.770
Frateretto calls me

416
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.030
and tells me Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness.

417
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:51.400
Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.

418
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:56.170
Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be

419
00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:57.670
a gentleman or a yeoman.

420
00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.330
A king, a king.

421
00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.070
No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son,

422
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.100
for he's a mad yeoman

423
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.930
that sees his son a gentleman before him.

424
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.930
To have a thousand with red burning spits

425
00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.600
come hissing in upon 'em

426
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.000
The foul fiend bites my back.

427
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.570
He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf,

428
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:24.170
a horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.

429
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:28.900
It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.

430
00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:34.100
Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer.

431
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.730
Thou, sapient sir, sit there.

432
00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:41.630
Now, you she-foxes!

433
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.900
Look, where he stands and glares.

434
00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.800
Want'st thou eyes at trial, madam?

435
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.030
Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me.

436
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.230
Her boat hath a leak, and she must not speak

437
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.030
why she dare not come over to thee.

438
00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.370
The foul fiend haunts Tom in the voice of a nightingale.

439
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:58.370
Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for two white herrings.

440
00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:01.800
Croak not, black angel; I have no food for thee.

441
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.170
How do you, sir?

442
00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.130
Stand you not so amazed.

443
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.900
Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?

444
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.430
I'll see their trial first.

445
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.300
Bring in their evidence.

446
00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.900
Thou robed man of justice, take thy place.

447
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.130
And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,

448
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:19.330
bench by his side.

449
00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.370
You are o' the commission; sit you too.

450
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:22.630
Let us deal justly.

451
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:26.400
Arraign her first, 'tis Goneril.

452
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.570
I here take my oath before this honorable assembly,

453
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:30.000
she kicked the poor king, her father.

454
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.230
Come hither, mistress.

455
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.770
Is your name Goneril?

456
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.070
She cannot deny it.

457
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.930
Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.

458
00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:41.170
And there's another, whose warped looks proclaim

459
00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.330
what store her heart is made upon.

460
00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:45.070
Stop her there!

461
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.200
Arms, arms, sword, fire!

462
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.630
Corruption in the place!

463
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.500
False justicer, why didst thou let her 'scape?

464
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.970
Bless thy wits.

465
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.100
O pity, sir, where is the patience now

466
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.270
that you so oft have boasted to retain?

467
00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.800
My tears begin to take his part so much,

468
00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.070
they mar my counterfeiting.

469
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:05.530
The little dogs and all Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart

470
00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.170
see, they bark at me.

471
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.570
Tom will throw his head at them.

472
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:10.600
Avaunt, you curs!

473
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:18.870
Then let them anatomize Regan,

474
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:24.430
see what breeds about her heart.

475
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.700
Is there any cause in nature that make these hard hearts?

476
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:35.970
You, sir, I entertain for one of my hundred,

477
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.770
only I do not like the fashion of your garments.

478
00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.200
You will say they are Persian, but let them be changed.

479
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:46.630
Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.

480
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.370
Hmm?

481
00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:01.770
Make no noise. Make no noise.

482
00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.270
Draw the curtains.

483
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.070
So.

484
00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.830
So.

485
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.300
We'll go to supper in the morning.

486
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:25.370
And I'll go to bed at noon.

487
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.470
Come hither, friend.

488
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:32.430
Where is the king, my master?

489
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.570
Here, sir, but trouble him not; his wits are gone.

490
00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.500
Good friend, I prithee, take him in thine arms.

491
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.400
I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him.

492
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.670
There is a litter ready.

493
00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:43.070
Lay him in 't and drive toward Dover, friend,

494
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:45.300
where thou shalt meet both welcome and protection.

495
00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.630
Take up thy master.

496
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:48.070
If thou shouldst dally half an hour,

497
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.670
his life, with thine,

498
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:50.900
and all that offer to defend him

499
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.500
stand of assured loss.

500
00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.830
Take up. Take up.

501
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.600
And follow me, that will to some provision

502
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.170
give thee quick comfort.

503
00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:58.570
Oppressed nature sleeps.

504
00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.800
This rest might yet have balmed thy broken sinews,

505
00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.330
which, if convenience will not allow,

506
00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.100
stand in hard cure.

507
00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:08.800
Come, help to bear thy master.

508
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.530
Come, thou must not stay behind.

509
00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.570
Come, come, away.

510
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:35.400
When we our betters see bearing our woes,

511
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.830
we scarcely think our miseries our foes.

512
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:44.470
Who alone suffers suffers most in the mind,

513
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:50.870
leaving free things and happy shows behind.

514
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:54.370
But then the mind much sufferance doth o'er skip

515
00:24:54.370 --> 00:25:01.000
when grief hath mates and bearing fellowship.

516
00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:08.630
How light and portable my pain seems now

517
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:14.270
when that which makes me bend makes the king bow.

518
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:18.670
He childed as I fathered.

519
00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.570
Tom, away.

520
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:29.830
Mark the high noises and thyself bewray

521
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.930
when false opinion,

522
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.970
whose wrong thoughts defile thee,

523
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:42.700
in thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.

524
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.930
What will hap more tonight, safe 'scape the king.

525
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.470
Lurk.

526
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.900
Lurk.

527
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.770
Post speedily to my lord your husband.

528
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.100
Show him this letter.

529
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.070
The army of France is landed.

530
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.470
Seek out the traitor Gloucester.

531
00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.470
Hang him instantly.

532
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.370
Pluck out his eyes.

533
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:16.170
Leave him to my displeasure.

534
00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:18.670
Edmund, keep you our sister company.

535
00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:20.370
The revenges we are bound to take

536
00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:23.500
upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding.

537
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.270
Advise the duke where you are going,

538
00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:26.670
to a most festinate preparation.

539
00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:28.030
We are bound to the like.

540
00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.730
Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us.

541
00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:32.770
Farewell, dearest sister.

542
00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:36.500
Farewell, my lord of Gloucester.

543
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.730
How now? Where's the king?

544
00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.000
My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence.

545
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.970
Some five or six and thirty of his knights,

546
00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.870
hot questrists after him, met him at gate,

547
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.670
who, with some other of the lords dependants,

548
00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:48.070
are gone with him towards Dover,

549
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:50.430
where they boast to have well-armed friends.

550
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:52.570
Get horses for your mistress.

551
00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.230
Farewell, sweet lord and sister.

552
00:26:58.270 --> 00:26:59.730
Go seek the traitor Gloucester.

553
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.270
Pinion him like a thief.

554
00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.070
Bring him before us.

555
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.870
Though well we may not pass upon his life

556
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:08.570
without the form of justice,

557
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:11.970
yet our power shall do a courtesy to our wrath,

558
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.030
which men may blame but not control.

559
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.670
Who's there? The traitor?

560
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.800
Ingrateful fox, 'tis he.

561
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.200
Bind fast his corky arms.

562
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.500
What means Your Graces?

563
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.670
Good my friends, consider you are my guests.

564
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:29.530
Do me no foul play, friends.

565
00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.200
Bind him, I say.

566
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.770
Hard.

567
00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.670
Hard.

568
00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:38.870
O filthy traitor!

569
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.270
Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.

570
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.070
Villain, thou shalt find

571
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:45.930
By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done

572
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.270
to pluck me by the beard.

573
00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.930
So white, and such a traitor.

574
00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:51.630
Naughty lady, these hairs,

575
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.070
which thou dost ravish from my chin,

576
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:54.730
will quicken and accuse thee.

577
00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.430
I am your host.

578
00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:00.430
With robbers' hands,

579
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:03.570
my hospitable favors you should not ruffle thus.

580
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.300
What will you do?

581
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.770
Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?

582
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.970
Be simple answerer, for we know the truth.

583
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.600
And what confederacy have you with the traitors

584
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.930
late footed in the kingdom?

585
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:18.670
To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king?

586
00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.900
Speak.

587
00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.570
I have a letter, guessingly set down,

588
00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:25.130
that came from one that's of a neutral heart

589
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:26.670
and not from one opposed.

590
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.900
Cunning.

591
00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.200
And false.

592
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.630
Where hast thou sent the king?

593
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.500
To Dover.

594
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.070
Wherefore to Dover?

595
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:42.670
Wast thou not charged at peril

596
00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:43.870
Wherefore to Dover?

597
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.300
Let him first answer that.

598
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.630
I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.

599
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:49.470
Wherefore to Dover?

600
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:51.070
Because I would not see thy cruel nails

601
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:54.430
pluck out his poor old eyes, nor thy fierce sister

602
00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:57.770
in his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.

603
00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:00.970
But I shall see the winged vengeance

604
00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:02.570
overtake such children.

605
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.800
See't shalt thou never.

606
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.230
Fellows, hold the chair.

607
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:10.000
Upon these eyes of thine, I'll set my foot.

608
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.600
He that will think to live till he be old,

609
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.800
give me some help!

610
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.570
O cruel!

611
00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:19.570
O ye gods!

612
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:30.770
One side will mock the other t'other too.

613
00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.870
If you see vengeance

614
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.430
Hold your hand, my lord.

615
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.230
I have served you ever since I was a child,

616
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:41.130
but better service have I never given you

617
00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.470
than now to bid you hold.

618
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:43.700
How now, you dog!

619
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.400
If you did wear a beard upon your chin,

620
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.730
I'd shake it on this quarrel.

621
00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:47.770
What do you mean?

622
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.100
My villain!

623
00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.800
Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.

624
00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.030
Give me thy sword.

625
00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:55.700
A peasant stand up thus!

626
00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.230
O, I am slain!

627
00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:04.770
My lord, you have one eye left to see some mischief on him.

628
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.930
Lest it see more, prevent it.

629
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.070
Out!

630
00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:17.700
Vile jelly!

631
00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:23.270
Where is thy luster now?

632
00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:27.630
Dark and comfortless.

633
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:32.630
Where's my son Edmund?

634
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:36.330
Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature

635
00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:39.100
to quit this horrid act!

636
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.230
Out, treacherous villain.

637
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.100
Thou call'st upon him that hates thee.

638
00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.700
It was he that made the overtures of thy treason to us,

639
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:50.070
who is too good to pity thee.

640
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:55.070
O my follies.

641
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:58.030
Then Edgar was abused.

642
00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:05.800
Kind gods, forgive me that and prosper him.

643
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.270
Go, thrust him out at gate.

644
00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:14.100
Let him smell his way to Dover.

645
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:19.370
How is't with you, my lord?

646
00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:20.400
How look you?

647
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.900
I have received a hurt.

648
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.130
Follow me, lady.

649
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.530
Turn out that eyeless villain.

650
00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:28.300
Throw this slave upon the dunghill.

651
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.070
Regan, I bleed apace.

652
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.270
Untimely comes this hurt.

653
00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.430
Give me your arm.

654
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:38.070
I'll never care what wickedness I do

655
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:42.730
if this man come to good.

656
00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:44.070
If she live long

657
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.730
and, in the end, meet the old course of death,

658
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:49.530
women will all turn monsters.

659
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.430
I'll get some flax and whites of eggs

660
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.800
to apply to his bleeding face.

661
00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.600
Now heaven help him.

662
00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.670
