ANNOUNCER:
You can have wars
and atom bombs,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.560
but, so it seems, there must
always be a Miss America.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.300
ANNOUNCER:
Just one4A,E.Dyoung girl

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.800
receives top honors
as Miss America.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.160
So democracy works here, too,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.960
for the Atlantic City
Miss America contest

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.660
is predicated on the conviction
that the typical American girl

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.700
has talent and brains
as well as beauty.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.330
WOMAN:
I think the Miss America Pageant

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.000
has been about the American
dream for<i> some</i> women.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.500
It has been about a dream
of being beautiful.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.360
It's also been about a dream
of being successful.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.300
And that combination
is, I think,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.730
the kind of complicated stew

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.400
that is very much American
women's experience

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.860
of the last 80 years.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.760
I am tingling with excitement

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.430
wondering who will be
the next Miss America.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.500
MAN:
When my kids were little, one
of the big nights of the year

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.060
was just the four of us
sitting there

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.060
watching the Miss America...

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.500
and saying,
"Oh, she's got to win."

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.160
And you root and you got
involved in it.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.700
And we all loved it;
it was a part of our lives.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.060
You know, in this 20th century,

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.700
we have witnessed
the birth of a legend,

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.900
the legend of the American girl.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.200
WOMAN:
I think it's a really important
story to tell

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.730
because it's about how we feel
about ourselves as women

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.300
and how we've changed as women

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.300
and who we are as women,

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.430
and what it means
to be judged by men.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.130
ANNOUNCER:
There are beauty contests
and beauty contests,

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.300
and then there's
the Miss America competition

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.860
and this year's crop seems to be

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.460
the most beauteous bevy
of breathtaking beauties

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.130
in decades.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.800
WOMAN:
The pageant is this example

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.500
where you can be sort
of nationalistic and patriotic

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.600
and pro-American and get
to see some T and A

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.160
all in the same event.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.530
The thing about the pageant

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.760
is that you have to have
a sense of humor about it.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.530
I mean, you've got girls who
have invested their entire lives

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.060
in wanting to become
Miss America.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.360
On the one hand,
it's this investment

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.000
of thousands of dollars
in this huge goal,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.300
and on the other hand,

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.260
a girl is spray-gluing
her swimsuit to her butt

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.530
so it doesn't ride up.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.800
You know,
this is like<i> Miss America.</i>

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.130
I mean, it's not
"Miss Coffee Beans."

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.200
It's not
"Miss Peach Blossoms."

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.530
This is the woman that
sort of represents the country

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.330
like the President does.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.930
And so it's seeing what
is the way to be

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.760
the woman of the most powerful
country on Earth.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.930
ANNOUNCER:
These were the fabulous,
furious roaring '20s

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.630
and this is why they roared.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.400
NARRATOR:
The Miss America Pageant started
out as a promotional gimmick

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.930
dreamed up by Atlantic City
businessmen in 1921

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.900
as a way to keep tourists
in town after Labor Day.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.160
Over the next eight decades,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.730
it would become
a national tradition

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.030
dedicated to defining
the ideal American woman.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.200
MAN:
♪ My darling, my duchess,
you sweet so and so... ♪

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.160
NARRATOR:
Year after year, the Miss
America Pageant would struggle

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.860
to pull off
a delicate balancing act:

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.000
Objectifying women

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.030
while providing them
with real opportunities;

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.160
promoting traditional roles

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.630
while encouraging
women's independence;

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.360
glorifying feminine modesty

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.760
while trading
on female sexuality.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.130
Along the way,
it would come to be a barometer

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.300
of the nation's shifting ideas
about American womanhood.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.760
But in 1921,

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.660
Atlantic City's businessmen were
simply trying to turn a profit

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:30.730
by capitalizing on the country's
fascination with beauty.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.430
WOMAN:
There are many
beauty pageants in the 1920s,

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.130
and they range from pageants

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.530
oriented towards
African-American women,

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.500
Miss Bronze America.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.430
Even the Ku Klux Klan
has a beauty pageant

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.730
for Miss 100% America.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.530
So there's something
about beauty as a symbol

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.100
that is extremely important

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:55.130
and many different groups are
getting together and saying,

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.330
"We have the most beautiful
woman who represents us."

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.130
And Miss America
is the national symbol

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.030
of what is going on
all over the country.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.700
NARRATOR:
The first Miss America Pageant

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.660
was a spectacular
two-day festival

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.800
culminating with
a beach-front parade

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.730
called the "Bather's Revue."

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.230
The only rule
for the competition

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.730
was that all participants

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.330
must positively be attired
in bathing costumes.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.900
A board of censors
had been appointed

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.260
to review questionable entries.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.360
WOMAN:
Atlantic City was a place

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.330
where everybody was kind of
given to letting your hair down

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.930
and having a delicious,
romantic time.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:41.460
Bathing suits
had changed a great deal

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.560
and stockings were now being
rolled beneath your knees,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.300
which was very daring.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.200
And women had to have
their bathing suits

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.760
at a certain length.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.630
And so there were beach censors
who would actually come down

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.800
and measure the length
of your bathing suit.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.060
NARRATOR:
On the morning of the Revue,

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.160
more than 100,000 people
swarmed onto the Boardwalk,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.060
hoping to catch a glimpse

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.030
of the scantily-clad young women
down on the sand.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.160
The spectators'
stand-out favorite

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.160
was a slight,
freckled 16-year-old

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.760
from the nation's capitol,
named Margaret Gorman.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.960
MAN:
Margaret Gorman was a sensation.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.260
She was tiny, petite, five-one,
with blonde, long ringlets

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.230
who looked very much
like Mary Pickford,

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.460
who was the biggest star
of the day.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.560
So, the combination

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:40.630
made this young,
16-year-old girl... a star.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:45.160
NARRATOR:
Gorman swept the competition,
and later that evening,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.360
she was crowned
the very first Miss America.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.760
"Margaret Gorman represents

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.500
the type of womanhood
America needs,"

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.430
the<i> New York Times</i> declared,
"Strong, red-blooded,

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.160
"able to shoulder
the responsibilities

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.400
"of homemaking and motherhood.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.360
It is in her type that the hope
of the country rests."

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.560
NARRATOR:
The first Miss America Pageant
was a staggering success.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.830
Before the receipts
were even tallied,

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.960
city officials announced plans

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.930
to continue the contest
through the decade

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:27.100
confident that as long as there
were girls in bathing suits

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.400
the crowds would come.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.230
It was one of the f)rCt,
if not the first instances

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.730
of the marb)a'EB%Dween g

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.160
and the beauty
of the female form,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.300
which was ingenious,
because from then on

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:47.000
many, many advertisers thought
they could get more attention

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.400
by putting a good-looking woman
into the picture.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.300
Some say it got started in 1921
in Atlantic City.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.260
FERENTZ:
The very first years,
there was a literal breakdown:

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.230
Five points for
the construction of the head,

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:07.200
five points for the limbs,
three points for the torso,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.660
two points for the leg...

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.900
I mean, it... you know,
and it added up to 100%.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.760
Whether they really went
by that, it's hard to say.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.500
NARRATOR:
Throughout the 1920s,

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.360
scores of young women flocked
to Atlantic City each year,

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.900
most hoping the pageant

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.930
would land them a career
in show business.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.160
While the average working woman

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.260
labored in a factory
or a typing pool,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.600
Miss America had offers
from Hollywood and vaudeville

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.730
and the opportunity
to cash in on her looks.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:44.600
ANNOUNCER:
Five feet, four inches tall,
118 pounds of beauty.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.660
Norma Smallwood is crowned
Miss America of 1926.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.260
NARRATOR:
During the year of her reign,
Miss America 1926,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.200
a small-town girl
from Tulsa, Oklahoma,

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.900
reportedly made over $100,000,
more than either Babe Ruth

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.930
or the President
of the United States.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.560
FERENTZ:
Norma Smallwood
had an acute business sense.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.960
In 1927, when she was due to
return to crown her successor,

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.800
she demanded a fee for her
appearance in Atlantic City.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.660
And although she arrived

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.460
and took part in the early part
of the pageant,

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.530
during the middle when that
money was not forthcoming,

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:33.000
Norma picked up and left for
another job in North Carolina.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.230
And the press
was not very kind to that.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.400
They thought that she should
have been the gracious one

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.900
that didn't take the money

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.200
and stayed around
to crown her successor.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.130
And Norma thought,
"I'm sorry, this is a business."

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.000
BILLIE HOLIDAY:
♪ If I should take a notion ♪

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.030
♪ To jump into the ocean ♪

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:04.700
♪ Ain't nobody's business
if I do. ♪

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.500
PEISS:
There was a general sense
that the old world had died

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.000
and a new one was being born.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.700
And I think that was especially
important for women.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.300
There'd been a women's movement

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.430
that had been successful
in certain ways:

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.130
Women had gotten the right
to vote, for example,

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.500
and women are increasingly in
the labor force in the 1920s.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.660
A number
are getting college educated.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.100
And so in some ways the pageant
seems to be a contradiction.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:35.160
Here, feminists had wanted women
to move into the public sphere

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.460
to sort of gain the positions
that men had gained,

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.800
and yet the pageant represents
women very much as female,

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.830
and as, in some ways,
sexualized as beauty objects.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.160
NARRATOR:
The pageant's attention
to the female form

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.460
had troubled
conservative Americans

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.560
since the very beginning.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.630
But in the late-1920s, critics
finally went on the offensive.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.500
All over the country,

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.930
women's clubs
and religious organizations

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.130
publicly attacked
the Miss America Pageant,

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:12.430
and accused organizers of
corrupting the nation's morals.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.500
MAN:
And her hips,
north, east, south, and west.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.060
Why look at those eyes...

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.130
"Before the competition,

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.560
the contestants
were splendid examples

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.660
of innocence
and pure womanhood,"

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.560
one protester argued.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.900
"Afterward, their heads were
filled with vicious ideas."

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.530
MAE WEST:
♪ Just look me over ♪

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.230
♪ Say, I'm plenty... ♪

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.760
NARRATOR:
In 1928,

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.500
fearing the controversy would
ruin Atlantic City's reputation,

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.960
the Chamber of Commerce
voted 27 to three

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.360
to cancel
the Miss America Pageant.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.800
WEST:
♪ Oh... ♪

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.030
NARRATOR:
For now, morality
had shut the pageant down.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:55.830
But America's infatuation
with beauty would endure.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:59.630
WEST:
♪ They call me
Sister Honky-Tonk. ♪

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.400
MAN:
♪ Keep young and beautiful ♪

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.800
♪ It's your duty
to be beautiful ♪

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:11.900
♪ Keep young and beautiful,
if you want to be loved ♪

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.730
♪ Don't fail
to do your stuff... ♪

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:18.100
It's very... it's very me.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.500
It's very... it's very Brandi.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.060
WOMAN:
♪ Take care of all
those charms ♪

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.360
♪ And you'll always be
in someone's arms ♪

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.730
♪ Keep young and beautiful ♪

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.730
♪ If you want to be loved. ♪

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:35.530
WOMAN:
I think the fascination
with beauty pageants is

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:36.960
that there can be a winner;

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.960
that there are certain rules,
guidelines

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.530
that constitute beauty;

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.230
that it is not necessarily
in the eye of the beholder;

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.200
that we,
as the collective beholder,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.430
have agreed on certain qualities
that create beauty

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:57.230
and, uh, that there can be
a contest to judge it.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.460
It's this fascinating thing.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.960
WOMAN:
♪ Keep young and beautiful ♪

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.360
♪ It's your duty
to be beautiful ♪

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.530
♪ That's right, girls... ♪

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.760
WOMAN:
What gets defined as beauty?

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.800
It's not unlike
high-fashion super models

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.630
in that the bodies that work are

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.630
the bodies that are least like
what women look like.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.130
So what are we saying?

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.630
What are we actually saying
about what women look like

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.260
when we say, "Well, you know
what, to be most beautiful,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.530
you have to not look like
what women look like"?

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:28.030
MAN:
I think that fashion and beauty
is everything

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:32.400
in the way a woman marks
her identity today,

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.930
unfortunately.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.900
But I can't think of a period of
time when it wasn't about that,

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.400
and there are all sorts of
obvious manifestations of that:

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.100
you know, the length of your
skirt, the size of your waist.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.560
But there are other
even more subtle things--

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.900
like when you shave your legs,

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.830
even if you're wearing pants
that day,

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:52.800
you feel three times prettier,
I think.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.800
WOMAN:
♪ If you're wide,
exercise all the fat off ♪

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.800
♪ Take it off,
over here, over there ♪

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.760
WOMAN:
You know, there's a yearning
in the human spirit,

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.200
an aspiring for beauty.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.800
And the successful man
still has

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.760
a beautiful woman on his arm--
that's the prize.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.400
It's been our power structure,
and it's...

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.800
it's still operative.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.860
Beauty is still the currency
out there.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.400
WOMAN:
♪ Don't fail to do your stuff ♪

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.730
♪ With a little powder
and a puff ♪

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.300
♪ Keep young... ♪

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.030
The traditional way to get ahead
is to compete with other women

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.000
for the favors of men, you know,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.400
and this is not different

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.630
from any other marginalized
or less powerful group.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:33.430
You're supposed to compete
with each other

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.830
for the favors of the powerful.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.160
So what could be
a greater example of that

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.960
than a beauty contest?

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.960
WOMAN:
♪ Boop-e-doo, ah! ♪

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.130
NARRATOR:
Not long after the Miss America
Pageant was canceled,

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.700
a devastating
economic depression

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.200
brought Atlantic City's
tourist trade to a halt.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.900
Desperate, local businessmen
opted to ignore the critics

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:05.000
and revived their
lucrative beauty pageant.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.600
In 1933, 30 young women were
brought to Atlantic City,

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.900
aboard a chartered train
called the<i> Beauty Special,</i>

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.200
to compete for
Miss America's crown.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.660
MAN:
Yeah, it's sort of relaxing,

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.900
what with strikes
and food shortages

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.900
and international disputes
and so on

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.760
to have the lassies back with us
once again.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.230
Oh, well, one good turn
deserves another.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:28.500
NARRATOR:
So striking was the change

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.500
between the ideal figure
of the '20s and that of 1933,

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.330
one observer said
of the contestants,

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.330
that one might almost
have thought

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.260
that a new anatomical species
had come into being.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.400
Among the entries was
Marian Bergeron,

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.260
a high-school sophomore

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.300
and the daughter
of a Connecticut policeman.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.430
BERGERON:
1933: it was the depression,

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.800
and at 15 years old,

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.860
I hadn't been out
of West Haven, Connecticut,

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.530
let alone wind up
in Atlantic City.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.760
NARRATOR:
A curvaceous blonde

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.230
with a striking resemblance
to screen siren Jean Harlow,

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.860
Bergeron had competed
in her first local pageant

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.400
just weeks before.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.800
To her surprise, she had won
the title of Miss New Haven,

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.960
and then Miss Connecticut,

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:20.930
and before she knew it, she was
being crowned Miss America.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.600
BERGERON SETZER:
To the judges' eyes,

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.360
I was the typical American girl:

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:31.630
totally unsophisticated, very
naive, had a lot of enthusiasm,

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:34.960
had a lot of talent
that they didn't even ask for,

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.530
but I did have that.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:43.200
And I was just... I was just
a 1933 typical American girl.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.860
My figure then,
as they described it,

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.500
was a typical Mae West figure,

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.100
which was hourglass:

00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:00.560
34 bust, 26 waist, 82 buns.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.330
NARRATOR:
The new Miss America
was just the kind of girl

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.800
vaudeville producers
were looking for

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.860
and they soon came
waving contracts,

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.660
promising to make her a star.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.300
But all the attention
was short-lived.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:18.060
As soon as the newspapers
reported that she was only 15,

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:21.630
the show-business contracts
were quickly withdrawn

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.360
and Bergeron went back
to high school.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:29.660
BERGERON SETZER:
On our way home, I had to go
back only to be met by the nuns

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:35.060
that said I had had entirely
too much undue publicity.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.760
And they felt

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:41.760
that it would be better
if I chose another school.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.800
Yeah, and that's practically
being kicked out of school.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.260
Here I feel like
I'm really somebody.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.130
You know, I'm just
the most glamorous thing

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.460
that ever happened
at 15 years old,

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.060
but the... but the nuns
didn't think so.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.500
PEISS:
Beauty pageants,
by the early '30s,

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.160
had a reputation for being
somewhat disreputable,

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.230
like a carnival atmosphere.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.060
Especially the association
with Atlantic City

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.360
and the seaside resorts
made that venue

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.360
somewhat of a question mark,
I think, for women

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.160
in terms of
their respectability.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.000
To be a public woman had
a long-standing connotation

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.460
of having loose morals,

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.430
of being either a prostitute
or sexually loose.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:35.000
And that doesn't disappear,
certainly through the 1930s.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:43.430
NARRATOR:
In October 1935, a pageant
scandal rocked Atlantic City.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:47.430
Less than a month after
17-year-old Henrietta Leaver

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:51.900
was crowned Miss America, a nude
statue of her was unveiled

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.300
in her home town of Pittsburgh.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.030
Leaver, a high-school dropout
and dime-store salesgirl

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:01.460
swore she had worn
a bathing suit when she posed,

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:05.300
and that her grandmother
had been present at all times.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.530
But the press coverage
was merciless,

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.030
and the businessmen
behind the pageant

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.460
finally decided to make
some changes.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.560
For help, they turned

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.500
to a single 29-year-old
Southern Baptist

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.830
with years of experience
in public relations.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.600
As the pageant's
Executive Secretary,

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.400
she would spend
the next three decades

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.330
inventing a new image
for Miss America.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:35.130
Her name was Lenora Slaughter.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:39.200
FERENTZ:
She was the iron fist
in a velvet glove.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.760
I think that she was a woman
that was well ahead of her time.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.830
She was tough
when she had to be,

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:50.530
but knew how to get by
on a Southern drawl.

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:54.360
NARRATOR:
Slaughter's mission now was
to eliminate scandal

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.630
and to attract what she called
"a better class of contestants."

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:03.500
She immediately established
a minimum age requirement of 18,

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.560
then added a talent competition

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.700
to the traditional lineup of
bathing suits and evening gowns.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.700
Once the contestants
were in Atlantic City,

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.760
Slaughter insisted they be
chaperoned at all times,

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.230
and that they observe
a strict curfew of 1:00 a.m.

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.000
They were barred
from drinking establishments,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.360
forbidden to smoke,

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.700
and there were to be no
private visits with men--

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.300
not even their fathers.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.530
LOUIS ARMSTRONG:
♪ I don't stay out late ♪

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:32.900
♪ Don't care to go ♪

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.500
♪ I'm home about 8:00,
me and my radio ♪

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.100
♪ I take a... ♪

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.960
A pageant judge
once asked Slaughter

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.160
what to look for in a winner.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.130
"Honey," she answered,
"just pick me a lady."

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:50.030
LEVI:
She brought a respectability
to the pageant.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:54.860
She presented her girls
with class, with style.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:59.100
She transformed the pageant
by setting the standards high,

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.430
by making it something

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:02.760
that women would want
to participate in.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.530
NARRATOR:
Sometime later,

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.630
Slaughter slipped
one final entry requirement

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:10.430
into the pageant by-laws.

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.000
Known as Rule Seven,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.300
the new regulation strictly
limited pageant participation

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:21.330
to women "in good health
and of the white race."

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:25.160
WOMAN:
Race has always factored
into anyone's notion

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.200
of ideal womanhood
in the United States.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.830
It's just that the way
in which whiteness functions

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.130
is through invisibility.

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:33.530
It's not seen as a race.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:36.460
It's just the normal way to be;
it's just regular.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:40.230
And it's really no different
in the Miss America Pageant.

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:43.000
ROSE:
That's what's most interesting
about it to me--

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.760
that we are supposed to believe

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.700
that this is what American
womanhood looks like.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.830
And it really is an enormously
narrow conception

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.860
from facial features,
you know, height, weight.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.930
And then of course,
there are the most obvious,

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:57.860
more political categories:
race, ethnicity,

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.130
and all of these things
are very important

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:02.530
in the historical understanding
of the pageant.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:09.960
NARRATOR:
By the early 1940s, Slaughter
had constructed an ideal woman

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.730
to represent
the Miss America Pageant.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.960
Now, the mass media would make
her a star.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:25.260
Each September, millions
of Americans watched

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.200
the annual newsreel
of Miss America's crowning.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.760
She was featured in newspapers
and advertisements,

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.660
and honored with her own day
at the World's Fair.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.560
And when the United States
entered World War II,

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.400
and the Federal Government shut
down most large public events,

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.100
Slaughter convinced officials

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.700
that the pageant should be
allowed to go on.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.800
"Miss America is emblematic
of the nation's spirit,"

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.630
she told them,
"and that spirit continues

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.660
through war and peace,
good times and bad."

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.460
Permission was granted

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.460
on the condition
that the winner sell war bonds.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.730
PEISS:
The early period of the 1940s

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:10.200
is one where we see women being
mobilized for the war effort.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.460
They're being encouraged
to take jobs,

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:16.730
to work more than full time
to support the war effort.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:20.500
At the same time,
those women are encouraged

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.030
to maintain their femininity
and their beauty.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:28.400
And there's a huge effort
to sell women lipstick,

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.500
to see cosmetics
as morale boosters.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:35.260
And they are one product that
is not rationed during the war.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.600
There's an attempt
to ration cosmetics

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.960
but it's overturned
within six months.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.660
Women are given the pitch

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.800
that one of the reasons
we're fighting the war

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.860
is for women to be beautiful.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:58.430
NARRATOR:
Lenora Slaughter believed

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.300
and she wanted Miss America
tto prove it.3

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:06.100
So in 1944, she convinced the
pageant's new board of directors

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:10.760
to award Miss America
a scholarship to college.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.460
Raising money proved
a bigger challenge.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:18.560
Of the 236 companies Slaughter
approached for contributions,

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.960
only five signed on as sponsors.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:27.260
But between them, Slaughter had
enough cash for a $5,000 prize,

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.500
and in 1945,
the Miss America Pageant became

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.530
one of the first organizations
in the country to offer

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.830
college scholarships to women.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.730
LEVI:
That's immediately what
redefined Miss America

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:47.300
because no othdB@Aant,
competition, beauty contest

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.260
was giving scholarship money.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.760
And by doing this,

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.600
it really, really set the
pageant in a different category.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.960
You didn't have to go in there

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.660
just to prove you had
a pretty figure;

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.830
you could go in there to prove
you had brains.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:03.000
NARRATOR:
Among those vying for the first
scholarship in 1945

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.860
was a 21-year-old New Yorker
named Bess Myerson.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.630
The American-born daughter
of Russian-Jewish immigrants,

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:13.530
Myerson had paid her own way

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:17.330
through New York's Hunter
College by giving piano lessons

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:20.300
in the Bronx neighborhood
where she grew up.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.200
Now she hoped to go on
to graduate school,

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.830
where she planned
to study conducting.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.200
MYERSON:
Talent was very important

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.060
because that was the way we were
going to make our living.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.360
That's what we were going
to support ourselves doing

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.930
when we grew up.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.000
The most important thing was
that you do well at school...

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Oh, no.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.900
The most important thing was

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.830
that you listened
to your parents,

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.330
that you do well in school

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.960
and that you play
a musical instrument.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.060
We never imagined anything else
would be open to us.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:56.360
NARRATOR:
To Lenora Slaughter, Myerson
seemed the ideal candidate

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.460
for the new scholarship prize.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:02.230
She was beautiful,
talented, smart.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:07.430
There was only one problem: she
would have to change her name.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:10.330
MYERSON:
Lenora Slaughter said my name
was not a good name

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:11.730
for show business.

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.160
And I said, "Well, you know

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.560
I have no intention
of going into show business."

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.830
I said, "What do you want me
to change it to?"

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:20.200
"Well, you know there are a lot
of good stage names,

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.600
like Beth...
Beth Merrick."

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:27.160
I said, "The problem is
that I'm Jewish, yes?

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.130
"And with that kind of name

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:33.230
"it'll be quite obvious to
everyone else that I'm Jewish.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.630
"And you don't want
to have to deal

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.700
with a Jewish Miss America."

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.830
And that really was
the bottom line.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.300
I said,
"I can't change my name."

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.100
"You have to understand.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.960
"I cannot change my name.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.460
"I live in a building
with 250 Jewish families,

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.300
"the Sholom Aleichem
apartment houses.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.400
"If I should win,
I want everybody to know

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.160
that I'm the daughter
of Louie and Bella Myerson."

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:06.500
NARRATOR:
On September 3, Myerson and
the other contestants appeared

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.900
on Atlantic City's Boardwalk

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.930
for the Miss America Pageant's
opening ceremony:

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:15.300
a victory parade to celebrate
the end of the war.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:19.100
In the crowd was Myerson's
older sister Sylvia.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.630
Her mother,
who spoke no English,

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.160
had been left at home
in the Bronx.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:31.460
MYERSON:
The first night, I compete
with a group of girls on talent.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.000
I won.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.700
Headline says,
"Jewish Girl in Atlantic City

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:40.530
Wins Talent
in Miss America Pageant."

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:43.430
Now, we've just learned
all the details

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:45.700
of six million Jews
being killed,

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.860
slaughtered, burned, tortured.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.930
And naturally,
it attracts attention,

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:55.000
and the juxtaposition of the
two things was so improbable.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.400
There were people
that would come to the hotel

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.700
where I was staying
with my sister.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.130
They would introduce themselves
to me and say,

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:05.230
"I'm Jewish,
and it's just wonderful

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.000
that you're in this contest."

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.930
But how about
when people came up to you

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:11.560
with numbers on their arms,
which they did, as well,

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:16.060
and said, "You see this?
You have to win.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:20.860
"You have to show the world
that we are not ugly.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.700
That we shouldn't
be disposed of."

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.330
And so on,
however they worded it.

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:31.000
I have to tell you that I felt
this tremendous responsibility.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.060
I owed it to those women
to give them a present, a gift.

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.530
That, to them, was the gift.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.800
NARRATOR:
On the second night
of preliminaries,

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:47.330
Myerson scored another win,
in the swimsuit competition,

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:51.600
and she now seemed a strong
favorite for the finals.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.230
"The new Miss America
will either be

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.530
Miss New York City,
Bess Myerson,"

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.460
one newspaper predicted,

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.500
"or somebody else."

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.830
MALE ANNOUNCER:
They're about to pick
Miss America of 1945.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:06.800
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
Well, they've made their choice,

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.960
and the crown goes
to Miss New York City,

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.900
a 21-year-old, 5'10" brunette,

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.660
Bess Myerson,
Hunter College graduate.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.530
NARRATOR:
By the time
Myerson's name was announced,

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:23.030
her sister, Sylvia,
was already in tears.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.660
From the audience came shouts
of<i> "Mazel tov!"</i>

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:33.500
"Don't let anybody kid you,"
Myerson said years later.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.760
"It was one hell
of a terrific moment."

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:44.830
LEVI:
Bess was the answer
to every Jewish woman's dream.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:48.030
Her win was such
a multilevel symbol.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:51.530
It was a symbol of a certain
statement against anti-Semitism.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:53.660
It was a symbol of a victory
against Hitler.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.200
It was a symbol for women,

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.760
and when she won, there was
great celebration in our house.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.830
It was like when Roosevelt won
or something.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.830
NARRATOR:
Myerson expected to spend
her reign making appearances

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:09.530
and promoting
the pageant's new sponsors.

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:12.930
But after an obligatory
four-week performance tour,

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:14.600
where drunks in the audience
demanded

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.730
she play the piano
in her bathing suit,

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:20.960
there were few requests
for her time.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:24.660
None of the sponsors wanted
a Jewish girl--

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.600
even a Jewish Miss America--

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.100
posing with their products.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:33.060
MYERSON:
Halfway through that year,
I said to the pageant,

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.860
"I'm not available to you
anymore,

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.860
"because I want to do
something else.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.230
"I've met people
from an organization

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:41.900
"called the Anti-Defamation
League.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.900
"And they've asked me to go out
on a tour,

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.330
"speaking at the high schools
and colleges,

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:51.200
"speaking to students
where there are problems

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.560
"having to do
with anti-Semitism,

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.900
with hatred, with racism."

00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:01.930
And I did a speech called "You
Can't Hate and Be Beautiful."

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:07.230
BANET-WEISER:
Bess Myerson took on the mantle
of Miss America

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:08.760
in a different way.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.630
It's the historical moment,
it's her ethnic identity,

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:13.860
it's her own aspirations.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.330
All those put together,
you know,

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:18.530
provided a very different kind
of Miss America

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:20.330
and a very different kind
of reign.

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:25.300
NARRATOR:
Myerson had made Miss America
a scholar and a lady.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:29.100
But the following year,
pageant judges made it clear

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.330
that looks still counted.

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:32.760
"It was the year
they brought out

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.300
the rubberized bathing suit,"

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.300
one of them said later,

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:40.160
"and we voted for the girl with
the best of everything showing."

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.000
♪ Five months, two weeks,
two days ♪

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.730

♪ Worried, oh, oh, baby. ♪

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.500
STEINEM:
The swimsuit competition
is probably

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.360
the most honest part
of the competition,

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.460
because it really is
about bodies.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:17.360
It is about looking at women
as objects.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.860
That's what it's about.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.730
The fact is
that the most disqualifying part

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:24.600
of the competition

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.700
is how you look.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:27.800
♪ Ooh, ah. ♪

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.160
♪ Ooh, ah. ♪

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.030
♪ Ooh, ah, ooh, ah. ♪

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.130
CHO:
When you see their bodies,

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:37.700
it's so interesting
because they seem so not real.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:40.400
You don't see anything off.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:44.530
They are so perfect
and not sexual, really,

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:47.460
but you... just kind of
these perfectly shaped women,

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.400
that their bodies
are very smooth.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.230
There's no creases or lines.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:55.100
There's no stretch marks
or nipples or hair.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.460
It's kind of jarring.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.630
You think,
"God, whose body is like that?"

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.760
And then you think,
"Maybe I'm not the woman.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.560
Maybe they're the women,
and I'm not the woman."

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.300
By then, you kind of feel
like an impostor, too.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.600
MIZRAHI:
It's always
so sort of heartbreaking

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.300
to watch
the swimsuit competition,

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.430
because these good girls,
they're sort of, like,

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:13.860
"Ooh, I'm such a piece of meat,"

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.300
Or something, you know.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.700
Of all the parts of the pageant

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.060
that, I feel,
victimize women the most,

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:20.630
it's that part of the pageant.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.960
These poor girls, in those
painful-looking high heels,

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.000
my heart goes out to them.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.060
But honestly,
if you have to wear a swimsuit

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.660
and you have to parade,
you should wear the high heels,

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.730
because there's nothing better
on your leg.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.060
WOMAN:
I worked so hard to be ready
to compete in the swimsuit

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.700
that I didn't dread it.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.360
You know, I actually found it
kind of empowering.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.300
I figured that once I got over
enough issues

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.300
to walk around on the stage
in a bathing suit

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.660
in front of 20 million people,

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.600
I could pretty much do anything
I wanted to.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.060
ANNOUNCER:
Go ahead and drool,
it's Miss America time.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.760
NARRATOR:
For more than a quarter century,

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.330
the bathing suit competition

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:07.430
had been the Miss America
Pageant's feature attraction.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:11.130
But with the scholarship program
now in place,

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:15.500
Lenora Slaughter wanted to
project a more dignified image.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.200
The challenge was to downplay
the bathing suits

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.360
without offending
Catalina Swimwear,

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.630
one of the pageant's
major sponsors.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.300
In 1947, Slaughter struck
the term "bathing suit"

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.260
from the official
pageant vocabulary,

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:35.500
and replaced it with the more
athletic-sounding "swimsuit."

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:39.660
Then she banned two-piece suits
from the competition,

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:43.060
and announced that Miss America
would now be crowned

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.200
in an evening gown.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.660
Still, when most Americans
thought of the pageant,

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.100
a girl in a bathing suit

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.430
was the first thing
that came to mind.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.700
Then along came Yolande Betbeze.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.700
A 21-year-old opera singer
from Mobile, Alabama,

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:06.360
Betbeze had been recently sprung
from convent school

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:12.430
when she captured her first
local crown, Miss Torch 1949.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:16.230
Miss Alabama wasn't far behind.

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:20.030
WOMAN:
I didn't plan
on the Miss America Pageant.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:22.060
I didn't know anything about it.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:25.330
I was in a convent for 14 years.

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:26.600
The last four years

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.930
in a cloistered convent,
behind high walls,

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:32.730
and no escape.

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:38.030
And I was very naive
when I arrived in Atlantic City.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:41.300
I mean, coming from a small town
in Alabama,

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:44.000
borrowing shoes of high heels,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.030
and taking the braces
off my teeth,

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:47.430
I had a ball.

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:53.360
NARRATOR:
The minute Betbeze stepped
off the train in Atlantic City,

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.830
Slaughter knew she was looking
at the next Miss America.

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.500
♪ Now give us fever. ♪

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.860
NARRATOR:
"Yolande was the sexiest,
most glamorous thing

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.930
I had ever laid eyes on,"
she later said.

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:07.760
Slaughter's new husband,

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:11.030
a business manager
for the pageant, agreed.

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:13.430
"She can't lose," he predicted,

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.830
"unless the women judges
run away from her."

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.360
FOX:
I thought I was a little
too plain to be Miss America,

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.030
but I knew that I would do well
in talent

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:30.300
as an operatic coloratura,

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.360
and indeed I did.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.460
I did win the talent.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.360
The swimsuit was difficult.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.530
Fortunately,
it was a suit in good taste,

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:44.400
one piece, white,
nothing very revealing.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:48.830
But even so, I mean, to stand up
for the first time in your life

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:51.360
in front of 50,000 people
in a bathing suit

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.300
is, is awkward.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:57.800
ANNOUNCER:
The field is squared off
at 16 curvaceous finalists.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:02.330
The winner is brown-haired,
brown-eyed Yolande Betbeze, 21,

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:04.800
of Mobile, Alabama.

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.000
NARRATOR:
The morning
after she was crowned,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.200
the new Miss America was
summoned to a breakfast meeting,

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.000
where she was to be briefed
on her duties

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.500
for the coming year.

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.860
FOX:
I did not know
what to expect with this.

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.630
So I arrived and they...

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:25.230
All these, these suits
were sitting about.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:27.860
Older men, board of directors,
congratulated me,

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:31.100
and said, "Now, Miss Betbeze,
this is what I represent.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.800
This is what you're going to do
for us."

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.360
Then it came
to the bathing suit,

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.500
the most important sponsor.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:42.260
And this man said to me, "In
November, we'll be in Wyoming,

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:44.260
and you'll wear
this and that bathing suit."

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.700
I said, "Wait a minute, please.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.000
"No-- no way.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.130
"Go into Milwaukee
in the middle of the winter

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:54.460
"and walk around a department
store in a bathing suit

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.260
"is not my idea of Miss America.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.630
Scholarship foundation,
the reason I'm here."

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:04.260
And he really, really thought
I had lost my mind.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.800
He couldn't believe it.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.660
FERENTZ:
I love the fact
that she made the statement

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:12.830
that she had to play their game
to become Miss America,

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:14.260
and once she became
Miss America,

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.700
they had to play by her game.

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.030
I thought it was
very bold of her

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:22.230
to say to one of its major
sponsors, which was Catalina,

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:25.330
that she just wasn't going
to pose in a swimsuit.

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:27.730
That she was an opera singer,
she was not a pinup.

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:33.230
NARRATOR:
Catalina withdrew its
sponsorship of Miss America,

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:37.560
and soon launched not one,
but two pageants of its own--

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.600
Miss U.S.A. and Miss Universe.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:44.600
Both judged contestants entirely
on looks

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.600
and absolutely required them
to wear Catalina swimsuits.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.360
LEVI:
For the pageant,
there was always this pull

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:55.900
between the pulchritude
and the pulpit.

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.930
There was always
this sort of dichotomy about,

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:01.530
"How are you an upstanding,
religious, well-educated girl,

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:03.630
and you can show
your thighs and cleavage?"

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:05.930
Which is always kind of
a theme of America anyhow,

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:08.700
sexuality and godliness.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.500
The Elvis Presley phenomenon:

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.930
shake your hips while singing
"Nearer My God to Thee."

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.400
NARRATOR:
In the fall of 1952,
the pageant's directors invited

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.160
an up-and-coming
Hollywood actress

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.600
named Marilyn Monroe

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.400
to serve as the grand marshal
of the Boardwalk Parade.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.800
"She wore the first dress
anybody had ever worn,"

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.100
that year's Miss America said
later,

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.830
"that was cut down
to her navel."

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:44.260
Monroe was not asked back
to Atlantic City.

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.030
It had taken
nearly three decades

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:54.400
to transform Miss America
from a local celebrity

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.630
to a national phenomenon.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:01.700
But making her a household name
would take just one night,

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:06.830
September 11th, 1954,

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:09.230
when Miss America
would be crowned live

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:12.430
on national television.

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:14.660
The pageant's board of directors
had asked

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:16.830
former Miss America Bess Myerson

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:21.130
to provide backstage commentary
for the viewers at home,

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:23.330
and had even invited

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:25.200
Academy Award-winning actress
Grace Kelly

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.800
to judge the competition.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.100
ANNOUNCER:
...plenty of excitement
out front, too, Bess.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.730
Just a while ago, the judges
announced the ten semifinal...

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:35.130
NARRATOR:
Now, as the cameras wheeled
into position

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:37.930
on Atlantic City's
Convention Hall stage,

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:40.230
ABC sent out
the broadcast signal,

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:43.560
and television audiences
coast to coast

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.000
joined the Miss America finals
already in progress.

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:56.160
WOMAN:
The only time
I really noticed a camera was,

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.060
we were waiting
to have the crowning.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.760
I saw a television camera,
and it was coming toward us,

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.160
so I thought,
"Oh, it's, it's time."

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.930
And then I saw Lenora Slaughter,
the head of the pageant,

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:11.360
bringing a banner over,
and she put it on my lap.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.400
She said,
"Lee, you're our Miss America."

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.630
ANNOUNCER:
19-year-old Lee Ann Meriwether
of San Francisco, California.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:23.760
My head flipped back,
and that is all I remember.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.430
And I was crying hysterically.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:29.000
Crying, crying, I couldn't stop.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.400
But I do remember my mother
being pulled backstage.

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.100
And my mother said,

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.660
(<i> whispering</i> ):
"Stop your sniveling."

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.130
(<i> snaps fingers</i> ):
And that did it.

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:40.560
NARRATOR:
More than 27 million people,

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.160
nearly half
of the television audience,

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:46.500
watched the Miss America Pageant
that night,

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.930
in a broadcast that broke
all records for TV viewership.

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:53.630
"To think that folks
out in Idaho could see this

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:57.100
was just amazing,"
one pageant volunteer recalled.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:01.130
"It just knocked everything
off the airwaves."

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:02.960
MAN:
The Miss America contest
was something

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.000
that seemed very glamorous
to all of us

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.700
in the '30s and '40s and '50s.

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.030
But all we ever saw of it

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:11.560
were snippets on newsreels
in movie theaters.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.760
And then suddenly,
when television happened,

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.200
here was this fabulous event,

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.860
and in that period,
it was incredibly popular.

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.530
When you look at old
black-and-white television now

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:22.930
it looks so prehistoric,

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:25.330
but, my God, it was free,
it was in your house,

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:26.330
you could watch it.

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:27.700
And it changed everything.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:30.060
ANNOUNCER:
The<i> Miss America Pageant,</i>

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.560
brought to you
by Philco Corporation.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.630
NARRATOR:
By the second broadcast,

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:37.060
the pageant had been
redesigned for TV,

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:40.660
and a celebrity singer
and announcer had been hired

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.830
to serve as the regular
master of ceremonies.

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:45.260
The 40-year-old star

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:48.600
of a popular TV program called
<i> Stop the Music,</i>

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.700
he was known to audiences
across the country

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:54.660
as the guy with the smile
you can read by.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.530
His name was Bert Parks.

00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:59.100
MAN:
Bert Parks.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.460
(<i> applause</i> )

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.600
Thank you very much.

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.800
(<i> applause</i> )

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.400
Thank you. Good evening.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.360
You're a wonderful audience.

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.960
HORN:
Bert Parks came along
at just the right time.

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:18.230
And his ability to be funny, to
be extemporaneous, to be silly,

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:19.730
and yet at the same time,

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:25.900
allow the women to be
the stars of the show

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.460
was a perfect series
of ingredients

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.960
that the Miss America program
needed at that time.

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:39.260
(<i> orchestra playing
 "Ain't She Sweet"</i> )

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.760
That's fine. Thank you.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.200
(<i> applause</i> )

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.860
And this, of course,
ladies and gentlemen,
is Miss Oklahoma.

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:48.360
From what city,
please?

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.260
I'm from Alva,
Oklahoma.

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:51.330
Alva?

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:52.530
Alva.

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:54.500
What is the
population of Alva?

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.730
7,000.

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:57.000
7,000.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.430
What is Alva
most famous for,
Miss Oklahoma?

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:01.800
Wheat and cattle

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.660
and my daddy's
bakery.

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:06.300

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.300
Golden Krust Bakery;
call him up tonight.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.700
(<i> laughter</i> )

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.860
LEVI:
I don't know
if he would fly today,

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.430
but he was really into
the girls, the women,

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:18.100
and that's what made Bert Parks
so different.

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:20.700
He wasn't a celebrity flown in
on a Saturday night.

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:22.930
He was there all week
getting to know them.

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:23.930
They trusted him.

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:25.930
He loved what he was doing,

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:29.200
and he really was one
of the defining factors

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.530
that made households
and television households

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:34.630
love Miss America.

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:38.630
And when he sang "There She Is,"
that was it.

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:39.930
There she<i> was.</i>

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:43.300
And now, Miss America
of 1958,

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:45.660
there is the runway.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.360
There are
your subjects.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.430
(<i> orchestra plays intro

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:55.600
PARKS:

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.900
NARRATOR:
Making its debut
right alongside Parks

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:07.030
was the official
Miss America theme song.

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:09.330
Composed in just under an hour

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:12.660
by a New York songwriter
named Bernie Wayne,

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:14.860
the song was an instant hit.

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:19.130
It would soon be as recognizable
as the national anthem.

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:24.430
PARKS:
♪ For she may turn out to be ♪

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:28.260
♪ The queen of femininity. ♪

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.400
PEISS:
It evokes a wedding

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:34.860
with Bert Parks kind of giving
away the... the bride,

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:38.400
or, in his youth,
he was more of the groom.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:42.060
It evokes the debutante ball.

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:45.000
PARKS:
♪ ...Who are more than pretty ♪

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.860
♪ Can come true

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.160
PEISS:
There is this real sense

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.160
of suddenly being the most
beautiful woman at the ball.

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:56.030
And so there is this sense that
this could happen to anyone,

00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:57.600
or at least that's the fantasy--

00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.330
that this could happen
to any girl.

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:02.000
PARKS:
♪ ...Sweetheart. ♪

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.860
There she is, ladies and
gentlemen, Miss America.

(<i> applause</i> )

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:11.530
ALVAREZ:
We didn't see a whole lot

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:14.230
of what it was like
to be an American woman.

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:17.660
This was our little window
into what it was like,

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:19.460
what this world was like.

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:23.700
It was a way to, I don't know,
climb the ladder of success.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.830
And so, you know, it was like

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:29.660
watching a female version
of a Horatio Alger story.

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.700
I had no knowledge
of the pageant really at all.

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.560
I knew that there was
a Miss America Pageant,

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:39.700
but I thought it was
a "bathing beauty contest,"

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:44.600
and as such,
I would never have entered.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.260
And then my father passed away,

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:51.330
and just, my life
sort of stopped right there.

00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:55.860
And my mother said, "The money
is no longer here, daddy's gone,

00:49:55.860 --> 00:50:00.430
"and if you want to continue on
with school, that's the thing.

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:03.060
Go to Atlantic City."

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.460
STEINEM:
Beauty contests are ways that,

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.600
if you live in
a poor neighborhood,

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:10.900
you can imagine getting ahead
because it is a way up.

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:13.230
It is a way to scholarships,
to attention,

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:16.160
and it's one of the few things
that you see out there

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.330
as a popular symbol.

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:18.800
When I was living

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:23.200
in a kind of factory working
neighborhood of Toledo,

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:27.960
the K-Part Television Miss TV
Contest, something like that,

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.030
was advertised.

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:32.460
So I decided I would try
to enter the contest

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:33.960
even though I was underage.

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:36.430
I think I was 16 and the limit
was... was 18.

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:37.730
So I lied about my age.

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:40.860
It wasn't a terrible experience.

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:44.000
It was a surrealistic
experience.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.200
You had to put on
your bathing suit and walk

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.000
and stand on a beer keg.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.200
I did, you know, three or four
different kinds of dances.

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.260
Spanish and Russian
and heaven knows what.

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.660
I thought I'd get money
for college,

00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.400
and it seemed glamorous.

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.600
It seemed to me, in high school,

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.160
like a way out
of a not-too-great life

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:07.260
in a pretty poor neighborhood.

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.960
NARRATOR:
By 1958, Atlantic City's
local tourist attraction

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:20.230
had become one of the most
popular television events

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:21.860
in the country.

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:25.400
With networks competing
over the broadcasting contract

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.960
and companies clamoring

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:30.530
to provide the high-profile
program with sponsorship,

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:33.600
the Miss America Pageant
could now afford

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:37.000
to award over $200,000 worth
of scholarships.

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:39.900
But winning money for college

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.900
was only part
of the pageant's appeal.

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:43.960
As every contestant knew,

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:47.960
being crowned Miss America
on national television

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:52.630
could turn a small-town girl
into an instant celebrity.

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:55.900
(<i> applause</i> )

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:58.460
I'm sure you all realize,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:01.800
what a frightening experience
it is for these young ladies,

00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:05.600
most of whom have never appeared
in public before,

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:09.760
much less here in the convention
hall in Atlantic City

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:14.460
before some 25,000 people and
over a full television network.

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:18.660
NARRATOR:
One of the contestants
that year was Mary Ann Mobley,

00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:23.330
a 19-year-old drama major with
her eye on the Broadway stage.

00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:27.800
A native of Brandon,
Mississippi-- population 2,500--

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:32.230
Mobley had competed in her first
pageant only two weeks before,

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:35.260
at the personal request
of Brandon's mayor,

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:38.100
and had walked off
with the state title.

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:41.230
PARKS:
Miss Mississippi.

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:42.330
(<i> applause</i> )

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:44.130
WOMAN:
Everyone was in shock.

00:52:44.130 --> 00:52:46.300
I said to my Sunday school
teacher,

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:50.000
I said, "I can't believe I'm
on the way to Atlantic City."

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.630
I mean, I had seen
the previous Miss America.

00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:55.730
She was tall.

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:59.560
I mean, her legs started
at my armpits.

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:05.400
And she had these wonderful
features and long blonde hair,

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:09.000
and I thought that's what
Miss America should look like

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.760
and I'm nowhere near that.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.430
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:16.100
we come to the talent
competition.

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.830
MOBLEY:
Now I have to tell you

00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:21.260
that I had never sung
with an orchestra.

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:27.430
And there I was in front of two
football fields put together.

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:29.630
Well, I was panicked.

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:33.060
And my horror was,
I was going to get out there

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:35.630
and no sound
was going to come out.

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:39.330
And one of the stagehands
tapped me on the shoulder

00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:42.800
and he said,
"You go get 'em, Mississippi."

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:43.800
Let's bring her on.

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.260
(<i> applause</i> )

00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:48.230
MOBLEY:
And they swagged the curtain,

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:51.100
and I thought,
I've got two options:

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:53.830
I can run,
or I can walk out there.

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:58.100
And I said I can't embarrass
my home state and myself

00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:00.160
by running away.

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:03.030
I have to walk out there.

00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:08.700
Tonight as my talent,

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:12.760
L!ACG a portion
of the lovely "Un Bel Di"

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:16.300
from Puccini's opera,
<i> Madam Butterfly?</i>

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:24.830
♪<i> Un bel di vedremo...</i> ♪

00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:33.800
MOBLEY:
And I started "Un bel di," and
it came out and it sounded okay.

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:38.360
♪<i> ...Mo confin del mare...</i> ♪

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:39.900
And then I said "Stop.

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:42.860
"But I'm tired of being
proper and cultured

00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:46.260
and of appreciating
Beethoven, Puccini and Bach."

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:54.160
I want to sing and dance to
something that's solid and hot.

00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:59.500
So there are gonna be
some changes made.

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:01.060
MOBLEY:

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:40.360

PARKS:
Mary Ann Mobley!

00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:00.800
FERENTZ:
I think Mary Ann
was very popular

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:02.660
because she was different.

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:06.830
She was tiny and spunky
and had a little bit of guts.

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:10.630
PARKS:
Here is your question,
Miss Mississippi.

00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:12.930
What is your
favorite topic,

00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:14.700
when with
a young man,

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:17.100
for opening
the conversation?

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:21.530
Well, I've read
different articles

00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:25.000
that tell you how to get
along with the opposite sex,

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.330
and the first
thing that they say is,

00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:29.330
get him to talk about himself.

00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:32.730
So the first thing I ask is,
"Do you play football?"

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:35.200
or "What sport are you
interested in?"

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:36.960
And then if he doesn't
say anything,

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.200
then you say, "Well,
what are your hobbies?"

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:41.200
And then you go down the line
from there

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:43.900

I think that she showed a

a more girl-next-door type.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.730
I think that more young women
could relate to Mary Ann

to the Miss Americas

00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:58.560
They had big pieces of paper

any of the talent

01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:12.960

It was another reason why it
became so popular

01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:23.830
because it was every woman
and every woman was competing.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.900
Or operating a three-hole punch.

I'm probably the best at that.

read something I'd written.

You know, I worried about that.

I mean, there was a way in which
I thought I could never be that,

because of the beauty.

I couldn't sing.

I couldn't dance.

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:17.760
I had an accent, so I couldn't
do a dramatic part.

By 1960,

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:50.400
the Miss America Pageant
had become a national ritual.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.930
Each year, on the second
Saturday in September,

01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:56.330
Americans gathered
in their living rooms,

01:02:56.330 --> 01:02:59.200
switched on their sets,
and settled in to see

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:03.160
if their favorite contestant
would capture the crown.

LEVI:
There was this time--

01:03:30.830 --> 01:03:33.300
what I sort of call the
"debutante era" of the pageant--

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.160
sort of the late '50s,
early '60s,

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.360
when everyone looked like
they were at a cotillion

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:38.600
with the high white gloves

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.430
and the crinolines
and the big hoop skirts

01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:44.000
and they were for God,
motherhood and apple pie.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.860
They wanted to be good mothers,
good wives.

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:51.130
They wanted to be supporters of
what their husbands chose to do.

01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:52.360
They wanted world peace.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:56.300
This is a
presidential election year.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:59.960
If a qualified woman
were running for president,

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:06.660
how would you feel about
voting for her and why?

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.960
If the men candidates running
were qualified,

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.400
I feel I would vote against her.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:16.130
My reasons being that women
are very high-strung

01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:18.260
and emotional people.

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:22.630
They aren't reliable enough when
it comes to making a decision,

01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:24.630
a snap decision.

01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:28.300
I believe that a man
in such a predicament

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:33.330
would be able to make a more
justifiable and better decision.

01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:37.260
What, in your opinion,
constitutes the ideal wife?

01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:41.830
I imagine that the ideal wife

01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:44.430
depends entirely on
the viewpoint of the husband.

01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:46.430
(<i> applause</i> )

01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:49.430
Some sociologists say
that American women

01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:53.530
are usurping the place of
the male in American life

01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:56.530
and have become
too dominant.

01:04:56.530 --> 01:05:02.660
Do you agree
or disagree, and why?

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:04.330
I do agree with that.

01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:07.930
I believe that there are far too
many women in the working world.

01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:12.430
I can see many cases where this
is a necessary arrangement,

01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:15.300
but I do feel that a woman's
place is in the home

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.830
with her husband
and with her children.

01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:22.760
HORN:
The concept of Miss America
as an ideal American woman

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.660
was consistent
with society's ideas

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.960
of what an ideal
young woman was.

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.500
She was your everyday young girl

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:33.160
who any man would be happy
to call daughter,

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:36.300
any man would be happy
to call wife.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:39.830
Miss America was
the American girl-next-door.

01:05:39.830 --> 01:05:44.300
She was an ideal
that many women aspired to.

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:47.830
NARRATOR:
Until now, the pageant had
managed to present

01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:51.960
a vision of ideal womanhood
that most of the country shared.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:56.760
But by the mid-1960s,
the all-American girl-next-door

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.900
was changing fast.

NARRATOR:
At a time when bikinis and
miniskirts were all the rage,

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.330
pageant contestants
continued to wear

01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:41.730
the regulation one-piece suits
and dresses

01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:44.860
that fell within two inches
of their knees.

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:49.160
While antiwar protesters marched
through the nation's streets,

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:53.130
Miss America was in Vietnam,
touring with the USO.

01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:56.030
And in a moment of
sexual revolution,

01:06:56.030 --> 01:06:59.630
the pageant's ideal remained
wholesome and pure.

01:06:59.630 --> 01:07:03.860
♪ 'Cause I'm a woman,
W-O-M-A-N... ♪

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:05.760
PEISS:
The pageant bore
no relationship

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:09.300
to the reality of life in the
United States at that moment:

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.730
the height of the Vietnam War,
a period of great civil unrest,

01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:15.030
the civil rights movement

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:17.200
and black power movements
at their height,

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.000
and the beginnings
of a feminist movement,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.030
the birth control pill,
the counterculture,

01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:25.630
the origins of the gay and
lesbian liberation movement.

01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:31.200
All of these suggested that the
pageant was terribly out of date

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:35.530
and that it really was no longer
relevant to the lives of women.

01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:41.300
It was a very exhilarating,
affirming, funny explosion

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:43.900
of rebellion and consciousness.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.530
It was partly
about taking off the symbols--

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:49.230
the gloves,
the little white gloves

01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:50.960
the dyed-to-match shoes--

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.460
and in the middle
of all of that,

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:55.460
the artificiality of
the Miss America Contest

01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:57.760
was an obvious kind of cartoon.

01:07:59.730 --> 01:08:02.460
NARRATOR:
In the spring of 1968,

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:05.660
a 27-year-old writer and editor
named Robin Morgan

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:07.830
decided to take a stand

01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:11.300
and, with help from a group
called "New York Radical Women,"

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.000
she began laying plans
for a protest

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.860
at the annual
Miss America Pageant.

01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:20.030
Where else could one find
such a perfect combination

01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:22.930
of American values?
Morgan argued.

01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:26.560
Racism, militarism,
and capitalism

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:31.960
all packaged in one
ideal symbol: a woman.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.430
WOMAN:
It seemed to me...

01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:36.000
a sort of epiphany moment

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.260
because it was the nexus
of so many issues--

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:45.030
beauty standards, money,
women's freedom,

01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:47.960
objectification of women,
patriotism--

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.760
and all of this somehow wrapped
up in motherhood and apple pie

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:54.360
or virginhood and apple pie,
in terms of Miss America.

01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:56.930
So it seemed like,
"My God, you know,

01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:59.300
what is not to dislike
about this?"

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:08.330
NARRATOR:
Word of the protest soon reached
Atlantic City,

01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:12.360
and pageant organizers braced
themselves for the picket line.

01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:17.460
It would be the first
major demonstration

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:22.100
of the women's liberation
movement in the United States.

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:25.230
MORGAN:
We had, you know, prepared
for about maybe 50 people,

01:09:25.230 --> 01:09:26.760
and to do some
guerrilla theater,

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:27.930
some songs, some chants,

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.900
to picket on the boardwalk
all day.

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:32.300
What we had not counted on was

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.960
that close to 400 women
showed up.

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.500
And they came from all over.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:39.660
I mean they were carrying signs
from Florida and from Wisconsin

01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:41.760
and some people drove
from California,

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.530
and that was just amazing.

01:09:43.530 --> 01:09:44.860
I mean, it had clearly--

01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:46.830
this protest--
tapped into something

01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:51.200
that was enormous and...
and very, very moving.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.460
WOMAN:
♪ Ain't she quaint ♪

01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:57.900
♪ With her face
all full of paint. ♪

01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:01.460
STEINEM:
They put on the boardwalk
a big trash can

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.060
and dumped in it
all kinds of symbols

01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:05.930
of the stereotypical
female role:

01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:09.030
a steno pad, a dust mop,
an apron, a bra,

01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:10.200
all of these things.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.630
I think they never did
burn those items

01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:14.500
because they couldn't get
a fire permit--

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.400
just shows you we've been
too law-abiding.

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:20.230
NARRATOR:
The demonstration
soon drew a crowd

01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:22.000
of more than 600 spectators--

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.430
most of them men,
and nearly all unsympathetic.

01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:28.830
One suggested
that the protesters


01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:32.200
throw themselves
into the Freedom Trash Can.

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:37.300
The threats, the epithets, the
screams, were mostly from guys

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:40.160
who would, you know, lean over,
the barricades and do the usual.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.560
I mean to say, sort of, you
know, "Go back to Russia."

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:49.000
"You're commie-pinko-lesbian-
crazy-broom-riding-witches."

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
You know, you name it.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.930
"You're all too ugly to be
in the Miss America Pageant."

01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:58.900
WOMAN:
♪ Ain't she fine. ♪

01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:01.230
NARRATOR:
Inside Convention Hall,

01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:03.530
the Miss America contestants
were running through

01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:06.660
one last rehearsal
before show time.

01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:08.360
Outside, on the Boardwalk,

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:12.830
the protesters were burning
Bert Parks in effigy.

01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:14.800
Parks was unfazed.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.800
When he got wind that one of
the demonstrators was planning

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.700
to infiltrate the pageant finals
that evening,

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.500
he didn't miss a beat.

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.860
"I'll grab her by the throat,"
he said,

01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:27.760
"and keep right on singing."

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.860
PARKS:
♪ So don't ever stop seeking ♪

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:34.530
♪ Don't ever let down. ♪

01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:37.360
♪ Till you you've found
your future ♪

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:40.960
♪ Till you've captured
your crown. ♪

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:45.230
NARRATOR:
Judy Ann Ford, an 18-year-old
gymnast from Illinois

01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:49.700
was the first blonde in 11 years
to be crowned Miss America.

01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:53.560
"I'm so glad," she gushed
to the press that evening.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.660
"I feel like
it's a breakthrough."

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:59.800
Meanwhile, just four blocks
from Convention Hall

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.530
at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel,

01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:04.030
another ideal
was about to be chosen.

01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:09.360
MALE CHORUS:
♪ Miss Black America...
we're so proud of you... ♪

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.460
NARRATOR:
Calling itself
a "positive protest,"

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:14.200
the Miss Black America Pageant

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.460
had been scheduled to begin
at midnight

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:18.660
in the hopes that newsmen
would drop by

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:20.500
when they left Convention Hall.

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.660
It was nearly
3:00 in the morning

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:27.330
before 19-year-old Philadelphian
Saundra Williams was crowned.

01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:30.330
MEN:
♪ Miss Black America... ♪

01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:36.060
NARRATOR:
"Miss America does not represent
us," Williams told the audience.

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:41.630
"With my title, I can show black
women they, too, are beautiful."

01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:44.200
ROSE:
Miss Black America is,
of course, an effort to say

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.260
"Well, look, trying to be
like a white person

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:47.760
is not what's at stake,

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:50.130
but appreciating what is black
is quite important."

01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:51.500
So<i> Essence</i> magazine emerges.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.060
"Black is beautiful," afros,

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:56.230
you know,
black women emphasizing

01:12:56.230 --> 01:12:58.430
that which is black
as beautiful.

01:12:58.430 --> 01:13:00.700
And so this was a way of saying,

01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:05.200
"We exist as both a market
and as a kind of esthetic"

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.930
really begins to take place
in the late 1960s

01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:10.930
and gets even stronger
in the late-'70s and '80s.

01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:15.930
NARRATOR:
All the controversy of 1968
took its toll on Miss America.

01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:18.360
And before the year was out,

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.500
Pepsi Cola, a sponsor of
the pageant for over 11 years,

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.560
withdrew its support.

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.560
"Miss America as run today,"
the company declared,

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.430
"does not represent the changing
values of our society."

01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:34.360
Society was swirling around it

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:37.230
but the Miss America pageant
stayed the same,

01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:39.800
continuing to worship
an outmoded ideal.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:44.360
In fact, the powers that be
at the pageant never did learn.

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:47.030
They never did learn.

01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:50.460
They didn't because they regard
the Miss America pageant

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.500
as sacrosanct.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:55.500
The Miss America pageant
had developed a formula.

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.600
The formula worked, and
nobody wanted to change it.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.600
You know,
often I've heard it said

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.500
"Is Miss America
relevant today?"

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:06.300
Well, is personal achievement
relevant?

01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:07.760
Is scholarship?

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.360
Is good citizenship relevant?

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.100
We think it is.

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:13.700
And we think it will be
for a long time to come.

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:17.930
NARRATOR:
The Miss America Pageant still
drew an enormous audience

01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:22.260
reaching a peak, in 1970,
of over 22 million households.

01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:25.000
But then the ratings
started to slip

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.630
and the pageant
was finally forced

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:29.760
to catch up with the times.

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.900
Presenting Cathy Clough,
Lisa Donovan

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:35.300
and a good friend, and former
Miss America, Phyllis George

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.660
with a comment
on a very timely subject.

01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:38.930
Women, tell it like it is.

01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:50.830
NARRATOR:
The time had come for
a new-style Miss America

01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:53.460
and in 1973,
the pageant found one

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:56.960
in an aspiring attorney
from Denver, Colorado

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.460
named Rebecca Ann King.

01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:03.600
KING:
I started watching the Miss
America Pageant as a young girl

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:06.830
and I wasn't really sure that
it was the kind of young woman

01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:08.100
that I was going to be,

01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:09.600
because I knew I was going to be

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.460
President of the United States
someday.

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:13.960
The young women looked
a little Barbie-dollish to me.

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:16.660
They looked a little
too made- up,

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:18.900
a little too "world peace,"

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:21.560
and I just didn't think
I was that kind of young woman.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.530
NARRATOR:
King was finishing up
her senior year

01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:28.430
at Colorado Women's College,
when a friend tried to talk her

01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:30.960
into entering
the Miss America Pageant.

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:32.430
I said, "What's in it for me?"

01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:34.200
She said,
"There's scholarship money

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.800
so you can go on to law school."

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.530
And so I said,
"Okay, I'll think about it,

01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:41.730
but don't tell anybody."

ANNOUNCER:
Rebecca Ann King, Miss Colorado.

01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:52.460
During the past 23 years, my
grandmother often said to me

01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:55.860
that the character of a nation
is determined by its womanhood.

01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:57.830
Through the practice of law,

01:16:57.830 --> 01:17:01.500
I hope to make a productive
contribution to mankind,

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:04.530
and find the happiness
of a fulfilled woman.

DREMAN:
I was really in it
for the money.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.500
And I think
it shocked the pageant

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.130
that I said
I was in it for the money.

01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:11.760
I didn't think
it was strange at all.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.160
I said, "What is it, it's
a scholarship program, right?

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.630
Isn't that what we're here for?"

01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:22.130
PARKS:

Very surprised
and, undoubtedly,

I didn't
fall apart as Miss America;

Walked over, got the crown on.

01:18:00.230 --> 01:18:03.130
And I think my mother received,
hmm, maybe 100 letters

01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:04.730
because I didn't cry.

01:18:04.730 --> 01:18:06.500
"She didn't cry.

do we have here on our hands

walking down the runway
not crying?"

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:18.260
NARRATOR:
For most Americans,
the real surprise came later,

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:22.000
when the new Miss America
began speaking to the press

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.100
and came out in favor
of legalized abortion.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:28.060
DREMAN:
It was right at the time
of Roe v. Wade.

01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:31.460
I thought a woman ought
to have the right to choose

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:35.360
whether to continue
with a pregnancy or not.

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.730
And, um... it just...
blew completely up

01:18:38.730 --> 01:18:42.560
and the pageant
never said not talk about it.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.700
PEISS:
Well, the Miss America Pageant
in the 1970s

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:48.830
is faced with the growing
politicization of women

01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:50.860
on both the left and the right.

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:53.600
And one of the key moments,
of course,

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:57.260
is the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court
decision in 1973.

01:18:57.260 --> 01:19:00.360
So when Miss America comes out
as pro-choice,

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:03.300
inserting a political stand
in the pageant,

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:07.330
which had always seen itself
as nonpolitical or apolitical,

01:19:07.330 --> 01:19:09.730
it really is
an important moment.

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:14.760
DREMAN:
The pageant has always been
a little behind the times,

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:17.030
but it was definitely the '70s.

01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:21.260
It was time for people to move
on, and the pageant was trying.

NARRATOR:
The national press applauded
Miss America's new image.

01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:38.060
Even feminists, who had been
protesting against the pageant

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:40.800
for half a decade,
now called off their war

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.960
and invited King to speak

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:46.930
at the National Organization
for Women's annual convention.

01:19:46.930 --> 01:19:51.630
Still, Miss America's television
audience continued to shrink,

01:19:51.630 --> 01:19:55.260
edged out by competition
from new cable networks

01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:58.930
and dismissed by younger viewers
as old-fashioned.

(<i> rock music playing</i> )

01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:04.260
HORN:
I think that a large number
of people

01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:07.000
began not watching
the Miss American Pageant

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.830
probably about the mid-70s.

01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:14.330
The ideals upon which the Miss
America pageant appeared to rest

01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:18.330
no longer seemed
very exciting or relevant.

01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:22.300
And I think we lost
a generation of people.

(<i> fast music playing</i> )

01:20:24.730 --> 01:20:26.700
NARRATOR:
By the late 1970s,

01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:29.900
pageant organizers
were desperate for viewers

01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:33.200
and casting about
for ways to update the show,

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.830
so they decided
to fire Bert Parks,

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:38.460
Miss America's
master of ceremonies

01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:40.560
for a quarter of a century.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:42.100
It was later reported

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:46.130
that the pageant's sponsors
considered 65-year-old Parks

01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:48.260
too old and too out of touch.

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:50.660
The decision caused
such an uproar

01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:53.260
that<i> Tonight Show</i>
host Johnny Carson

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:57.200
even held an on-air campaign
to get Parks reinstated.

01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:59.660
The pageant replaced him anyway.

01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:03.430
But a new host
did not bring new viewers.

ROSE:
I was a teenager
in the late '70s,

01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:09.460
and I, um... my recollection
of the pageant

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:11.730
was that it just...
being a New Yorker

01:21:11.730 --> 01:21:15.600
it just didn't seem to reflect
what the city looked like to me.

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:19.330
So the pageant was a sort
of helpful travelscape for me

01:21:19.330 --> 01:21:22.600
like, oh, this is what women
look like in Texas and Florida.

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.400
I was pretty much sure

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:27.200
that the most blonde was going
to be in the top two

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:28.700
if not the number one slot.

01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:30.460
If a brunette was going to win,

01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:33.160
it was because of some other
extraordinary traits

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:36.100
that were compensating,
but I very much understood it

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:39.200
as a tall, blonde, you know,
Southern women's festival.

CHO:
My father was very into it.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.430
And then, at one point
when I was a little girl,

01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:48.500
I said, "I want to be
one of those contestants.

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:50.560
I want to grow up and do that."

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.230
And he said, "No, oh, no,

01:21:52.230 --> 01:21:53.830
you cannot do that, no."

01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:55.760
You know, like...

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.830
And I took it to mean

01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:00.230
that the beauty pageant
was not open to all women.

01:22:00.230 --> 01:22:02.360
I mean, my father thought

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.160
that this whole pageant
was fascinating

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:07.760
and we would pick out the
winners, but I was not allowed

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:11.230
to even entertain the fantasy
of becoming one of these women.

01:22:11.230 --> 01:22:13.460
And I thought, "Maybe
I'm just not pretty enough.

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:14.930
Or maybe I'm just not white."

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:17.260
I remember always sitting
in front of the television

01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:19.200
watching the Miss America
every single year

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.800
when I was a little kid,
and I was the only one watching.

01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:23.300
Everybody else
kind of went to bed,

01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:24.700
and I would be so excited.

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:26.430
"Mom, I chose
the first runner up

01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:27.660
or the second runner up."


01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:29.260
But the interesting thing
about that,

01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:32.330
I always kind of saw myself
on stage as well,

01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:34.530
although no one looked like me;

01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:36.460
there was no one
who looked like me.

In the decade that followed,

there had been just
ten other black contestants

had made the top five:

And even though
that was wonderful,

And I said, "If Arkansas
is ready, America is ready,"

01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:35.130
but, obviously,
America wasn't ready.

01:23:35.130 --> 01:23:41.230
NARRATOR:
But in 1983, the 61st year
of the Miss America Pageant,

01:23:41.230 --> 01:23:43.860
everything suddenly changed.

NARRATOR:
A 20-year-old musical theater
major at Syracuse University,

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.560
Williams had entered the pageant

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.900
in the hope of breaking
into show business.

01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:22.060
Like so many Miss Americas
before her,

01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:24.830
she wanted to be a star.

01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:27.430
But first, she would become
a political symbol.

NARRATOR:
To some, the crowning
of a black Miss America

01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:39.000
was a milestone in the struggle
against bigotry.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.430
"Thank God I have lived
long enough,"

01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:43.800
said Congresswoman
Shirley Chisholm,

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:46.300
"that this nation
has been able to select

01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:49.730
the beautiful young woman
of color to be Miss America."

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:02.030
WOMAN:
That was the first time I
remember watching Miss America,

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:06.630
and I remember her singing,
I remember her performance,

01:25:06.630 --> 01:25:09.100
I remember her being crowned,

01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:13.300
and I remember thinking,
"Wow, she looks like me."

01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:16.200
I had never at that point,
I had heard of Miss America,

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.100
but I had never at that point
thought that Miss America

01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:22.230
was something that was for me
or something that I could do.

01:25:22.230 --> 01:25:25.160
I think everybody
was shocked, excited

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:28.360
and just looking forward
to having a year

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:31.900
where there was a Miss America
that was black

01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:33.800
and would get to do
all the great things

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.900
that every other Miss America
had ever done.

01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:40.430
So I think it was just a time
of excitement and anticipation.

01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:47.430
NARRATOR:
Williams' fans made her the most
heavily-booked Miss America

01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:49.630
in the pageant's history.

01:25:49.630 --> 01:25:52.930
Not quite ten months
into her reign,

01:25:52.930 --> 01:25:57.430
she had already earned
a record $125,000 in fees.

01:25:57.430 --> 01:26:00.700
I remember talking
to some pageant people

01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:03.960
and they said that the best
Miss America they ever had

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.300
was Vanessa Williams.

01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:06.900
She was just sensational.

01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:10.260
She was just the most verbal,
bright, terrific seller

01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:13.060
of the Miss America contest
they'd ever had.

01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:15.260
NARRATOR:
But there were those

01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:18.600
who considered
Williams' victory an affront.

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.030
For the first time,

01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:23.800
Miss America received
death threats and hate mail.

01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:26.630
When she made appearances
in the south,

01:26:26.630 --> 01:26:30.530
armed guards had to be posted
at her hotel room door.

01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:33.430
And even in
the African-American community,

01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:35.660
there were
those who assailed her

01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.700
for not being "black" enough.

01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:39.830
Then, in July of 1984,

01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:44.930
Williams was informed
that an unauthorized pictorial,

01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:46.900
featuring explicit nude photos

01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:49.200
she had posed for
two years earlier,

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:53.230
was about to be published
in<i> Penthouse</i> magazine.

01:26:53.230 --> 01:26:58.030
Pageant officials
were quick to respond.

01:26:58.030 --> 01:27:01.530
We do not believe under the
content and spirit of the rules,

01:27:01.530 --> 01:27:05.060
as well as the contracts as well
as the image of Miss America,

01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:07.060
that she should remain
Miss America

01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:09.230
and still give
this particular program

01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:12.260
the vitality and the respect
to which it's entitled.

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:13.730
If you don't
draw the line here,

01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:15.360
where do you
draw the line?

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:18.460
HORN:
The sponsors were waiting
on the sidelines.

01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:22.530
We had received a warning that
if we didn't handle this right,

01:27:22.530 --> 01:27:24.560
they were going to pull out.

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.600
If they'd pulled out
at the end of July,

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:29.660
there would've been no money and
no Miss America Pageant in 1984.

01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:32.160
And there would not be
a Miss America Pageant today.

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.800
That's how close we came.

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:37.530
NARRATOR:
Williams was given
72 hours to resign.

01:27:37.530 --> 01:27:41.030
She would be allowed
to keep her scholarship

01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:43.430
and the money she had earned,

01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:46.660
but her title would be given
to the first runner-up,

01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:48.530
Suzette Charles.

01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:52.130
WOMAN:
It is one thing to face up to a
mistake that one makes in youth.

01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:55.900
But it is almost totally
devastating to have to share it

01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:59.030
with the American public
and the world at large

01:27:59.030 --> 01:28:01.930
as both a human being
and as Miss America.

01:28:01.930 --> 01:28:04.200
I put the session
in the back of my mind

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:07.630
and believed the photos would
never be used for any purpose,

01:28:07.630 --> 01:28:10.160
as the photographer
had verbally assured me.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.430
I never consented
to the publication

01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:17.660
or the use of these photographs
in any manner.

01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:22.300
NARRATOR:
It was the first time in
the pageant's six-decade history

01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:25.900
that a Miss America
was asked to give up her crown.

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:28.960
COCKERHAM:
I think a lot of people
were very disappointed.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:31.530
And I think
any minority community

01:28:31.530 --> 01:28:35.160
looks to their role models
that are so accepted

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:37.460
and are so loved by everybody

01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:41.900
as a point of,
you know, inspiration,

01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:46.160
and maybe at that point it is,
you are let down,

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.930
that, okay, these
are choices that she made

01:28:48.930 --> 01:28:51.430
that have caused a lot
of embarrassment

01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:55.030
to her and her family,
but also to the black community.

01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:58.930
ROSE:
I do remember feeling, you know,
incredibly sorry for her.

01:28:58.930 --> 01:29:01.730
I just felt that she
was carrying the weight

01:29:01.730 --> 01:29:05.600
of this whole history of vicious
stereotypes about black women,

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.900
and simply by trying
to win the pageant,

01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:10.430
she was, in a sense,

01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:14.130
trying to counter
many of those stereotypes.

01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:15.630
And then, you know,

01:29:15.630 --> 01:29:17.930
to have these pictures emerge
to undermine it

01:29:17.930 --> 01:29:20.760
was, you know, probably
the most vicious way to have it,

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:22.660
because, you know,
I would be stunned

01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:24.700
if she was
the first pageant contestant

01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:26.760
to have tried
to raise money as a model

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.530
by doing
these kinds of pictures.

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:30.000
I would be really shocked.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.530
But I wouldn't be surprised

01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:35.060
if people were more interested
in finding hers to undermine it

01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:37.300
because she, in a sense,
by definition,

01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:40.060
threw the rest of the
contestants into stark relief.

01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:45.130
NARRATOR:
The Vanessa Williams issue
of<i> Penthouse</i>

01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:47.800
would ultimately bring in
over $20 million,

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:51.030
the magazine's all-time,
single-issue sales record.

01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:53.500
CHO:
You know, what's
great about it is

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:57.200
that she's the only Miss America
that anybody remembers,

01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:00.800
and she's the only one
that ever really became a star.

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:05.560
And... and... uh, that is
what's really great,

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:11.500
is that she has the most
"Kiss my ass" story--

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:14.330
that... that you can
triumph over anything.

01:30:14.330 --> 01:30:16.830
So she's certainly
a big hero of mine.

01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:22.800
NARRATOR:
For a time, the scandal
revived public interest

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.430
in the Miss America Pageant,

01:30:24.430 --> 01:30:30.030
and ticket sales for the 1984
finals rose by 20%.

01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:34.260
That night, after only
two months as Miss America,

01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:37.430
Suzette Charles walked
the Convention Hall runway

01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:40.830
to a standing ovation
before crowning her successor,

01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:46.100
20-year-old Sharlene Wells,
a tall, blonde Mormon

01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:50.860
whom USA Today described
as "squeaky-clean."

NARRATOR:
Confronted now by
the possibility of scandals

01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:10.630
that Lenora Slaughter
never could have imagined,

01:31:10.630 --> 01:31:14.930
pageant directors drew up
a new contestant contract,

01:31:14.930 --> 01:31:17.060
gradually adding
dozens of regulations

01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:19.660
to which potential Miss Americas
were subject.

01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:21.330
CHORUS:
♪ I can fly! ♪

01:31:21.330 --> 01:31:23.300
WOMAN:
That you've always
been female, is one.

01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:24.700
Isn't that hilarious?

01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:26.960
You have to sign
a contract saying,

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.660
"I've always been female."

01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:30.260
There's a clause in the contract

01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:32.130
that you have never
posed in the nude.

01:31:32.130 --> 01:31:33.660
There's also a clause
that you can't

01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:35.600
be the natural
or adoptive parent of a child.

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.430
And then there
is a clause in the contract

01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:39.060
that you have never
done anything

01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:41.430
that could possibly
be interpreted as illegal,

01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:42.930
immoral, unethical, whatever.

01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:45.230
And, you know,
everybody signs the contract,

01:31:45.230 --> 01:31:47.760
but who didn't cheat
on a second grade math test?

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:52.100
NARRATOR:
With the changes in the contract
came a renewed campaign

01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:55.160
to portray Miss America
as a "thinking woman,"

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:59.000
who would make a positive
contribution to society.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:03.400
In 1989,
pageant officials introduced

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:05.700
a new competitive element
called "the platform,"

01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:07.030
which required contestants

01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:08.900
to demonstrate
an ongoing commitment

01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:11.230
to a social problem

01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:14.030
and to back it up
with community service.

01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:15.800
Hello from the Sunshine State.

01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:17.600
I'm devoted to promoting unity

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:20.530
through the celebration
of our cultural diversity.

01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:22.760
I am devoted
to encouraging youth

01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:25.230
to postpone
their sexual activity.

01:32:25.230 --> 01:32:28.230
My personal commitment
is to child abuse prevention

01:32:28.230 --> 01:32:30.130
through my program, TRUST.

01:32:30.130 --> 01:32:31.500
SHINDLE:
One of those things

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:32.700
people love to make fun of.

01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:34.330
"I'd love to...
I support world peace

01:32:34.330 --> 01:32:36.030
and I want to give
everyone a flower."

01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:39.900
During my year as Miss America,

01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:42.300
because I was talking
about AIDS, which was something

01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:45.130
that people don't necessarily
associate with the conservative,

01:32:45.130 --> 01:32:47.600
white bread, grass roots,
Miss America organization,

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.330
it got a lot of media attention.

01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:53.800
I took some flack for talking to
students about sexual activity,

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:56.760
certainly about abstinence,
but also about safer sex.

01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:59.600
There are people who don't want
you to come to their high school

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:01.360
and say things like that.

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:04.230
But I will tell you that Miss
America got me so much access.

01:33:04.230 --> 01:33:06.460
The fact that I was
invited to speak

01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:09.230
at middle and high schools
in middle America

01:33:09.230 --> 01:33:10.860
where they would<i> never,</i>

01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:14.830
never invite an AIDS activist to
come and speak to their kids--

01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:17.300
but they'll roll out
the red carpet for Miss America

01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:19.760
and hope she brings her crown--
was an enormous part

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:22.830
of what I felt was effective
during that year.

01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:26.500
ANNOUNCER:
Live, from Atlantic City,

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:29.600
ABC proudly presents
"Miss America."

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:38.800
(<i> cheering and applause</i> )

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:41.060
WOMAN:
I would love
for everyone to join hands

01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:44.330
and we'll say a little prayer.

01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:47.500
NARRATOR:
More than 80 years

01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:50.160
after the first contest
was held in Atlantic City,

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:52.730
the Miss America Pageant
still endures.

01:33:52.730 --> 01:33:54.960
WOMAN:
We come here in friendship,

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:57.500
one in community
and one in service...

01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:02.160
NARRATOR:
It is one of the longest-running
television programs

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:06.300
in American history, seen
by more than a billion people

01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:08.860
since its first broadcast
in 1954.

01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:12.560
It is also the single largest
scholarship organization

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:14.200
for women in the world.

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:17.060
Each year,
1,200 state and local pageants

01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:20.500
are franchised by
the Miss America Organization.

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:23.530
And each year,
more than 10,000 young women

01:34:23.530 --> 01:34:26.430
enter those contests,
all of them hoping

01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:29.860
Miss America's crown
will change their lives.


01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:32.360
So with that
in Jesus' name we pray.

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.360
Amen.

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:35.600
Go, girls,
you go out there

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:36.700
and get them,
all right?

01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:41.600
(<i> applause and cheers</i> )

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:42.900
Good luck.

01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:44.230
Good luck.

01:34:44.230 --> 01:34:46.000
MAN:
One minute folks.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.530
One minute to air.

01:34:47.530 --> 01:34:49.060
WOMAN:
60 seconds.

01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:50.660
(<i> percussion thundering</i> )

01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:52.900
(<i> contestants cheering</i> )

01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:56.160
COCKERHAM:
I think every contestant
that comes to Miss America

01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:57.430
has a different agenda.

01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:58.830
Some contestants come there

01:34:58.830 --> 01:35:01.700
because they want to be
discovered by a modeling agency

01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:04.130
or they want to go into acting
or broadcasting.

01:35:04.130 --> 01:35:07.030
Many contestants go because
of their social activism.

01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:09.700
Many contestants go
just because they have this idea

01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:12.600
of Miss America with the crown
walking down the runway.

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:17.560
(<i> up-tempo instrumental version
 of "Miss America" playing</i> )

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.560
(<i> applause and cheering</i> )

01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:38.160
WOMAN:
I would love to be
your next Miss America.

01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:41.530
It would give me the opportunity

01:35:41.530 --> 01:35:46.260
to represent
many wonderful people.

01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:48.100
It would also enable me

01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:52.100
to further my education
at Sacramento State College.

01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:55.760
It would give me the opportunity
to meet many wonderful people

01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:59.860
which I wouldn't otherwise
have the opportunity of meeting.

01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:05.000
It would also considerably
broaden my outlook on life.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.660
I would love to be
your next Miss America.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.030
(<i> cheering and applause</i> )

01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:44.300
CHO:
I think that women's roles

01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:47.100
have changed so much
in the last 20 years,

01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:49.160
that we are constantly looking

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:52.160
for the outside world
to tell us who we are.

01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:57.200
We really search
for this "for-sure" identity,

01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:01.100
for this "for-sure"
being of who we are,

01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:05.930
and the pageant is one way
of defining ourselves.

01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:09.660
GOLDMAN:
I wonder, I don't know.

01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:11.630
Do little girls now
of six and seven

01:37:11.630 --> 01:37:13.230
dream of being Miss America?

01:37:13.230 --> 01:37:14.530
I don't know.

01:37:14.530 --> 01:37:16.460
Or do they dream
of replacing Bill Gates?

01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:17.460
I have no idea.

01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:22.500
BANET-WEISER:
It's not you either love it
or you hate it,

01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:25.330
it's not
it's either good or bad.

01:37:25.330 --> 01:37:29.700
It just doesn't fit that neatly
into one of those boxes.

01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:35.200
I think that what civic rituals
do is that they are stories

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:37.260
that we tell ourselves
about ourselves.

01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:39.330
And I think
that along with considering

01:37:39.330 --> 01:37:41.660
the Miss America Pageant
as popular culture,

01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:44.630
we needed to consider it
as about imagining citizenship

01:37:44.630 --> 01:37:49.060
and imagining, who we are, why
we're here, and what we're for.
