00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.330


2
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.370
You know since Pentecostthe sum is due,

3
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.370
And since I have not muchimportuned you;

4
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.370
Nor now I had not, butthat I am bound

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.600
To Persia, and wantguilders for my voyage:

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.230
Therefore make presentsatisfaction,

7
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.300
Or I'll attach you by thisofficer.

8
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.000
Even just the sum that Ido owe to you

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Is growing to me byAntipholus,

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.530
And in the instant that Imet with you

11
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.200
He had of me a chain: atfive o'clock

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.670
I shall receive the moneyfor the same.

13
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.170
Pleaseth you walk with medown to his house,

14
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.400
I will discharge my bondand thank you too.

15
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.000
That labour may you save:see where he comes.

16
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.770
While I go to thegoldsmith's house, go thou

17
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.600
And buy a rope's end: thatwill I bestow

18
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.230
Among my wife and herconfederates,

19
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.500
For locking me out of mydoors by day.

20
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.230
But, soft! I see thegoldsmith. Get thee gone;

21
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.100
Buy thou a rope and bringit home to me.

22
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.200
I buy a thousand pound ayear: I buy a rope.

23
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.300
A man is well holp up thattrusts to you:

24
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.200
I promised your presenceand the chain;

25
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.300
But neither chain norgoldsmith came to me.

26
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.630
Belike you thought ourlove would last too long,

27
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.170
If it were chain'dtogether,

28
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.630
and thereforecame not.

29
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.670
Saving your merry humour,here's the note

30
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.530
How much your chain weighsto the utmost carat,

31
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.000
The fineness of the goldand chargeful fashion.

32
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.600
Which doth amount to threeodd ducats more

33
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.900
Than I stand debted tothis gentleman:

34
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.500
I pray you, see himpresently discharged,

35
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.870
For he is bound to sea andstays but for it.

36
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.530
I am not furnish'd withthe present money;

37
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.430
Besides, I have somebusiness in the town.

38
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.730
Good signior, take thestranger to my house

39
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.370
And with you take thechain and bid my wife

40
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.430
Disburse the sum on thereceipt thereof:

41
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.330
Perchance I will be thereas soon as you.

42
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.370
Then you will bring thechain to her yourself?

43
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.430
No; bear it with you, lestI come not time enough.

44
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.600
Well, sir, I will. Haveyou the chain about you?

45
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.500
An if I have not, sir, Ihope you have;

46
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.300
Or else you may returnwithout your money.

47
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.700
Nay, come, I pray you,sir, give me the chain:

48
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.870
Both wind and tide staysfor this gentleman,

49
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.430
And I, to blame, have heldhim here too long.

50
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.770
Good Lord! you use thisdalliance to excuse

51
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.100
Your breach of promise tothe Porpentine.

52
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.930
I should have chid you fornot bringing it,

53
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.270
But, like a shrew, youfirst begin to brawl.

54
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.900
The hour steals on; I prayyou, sir, dispatch.

55
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.930
You hear how he importunesme;--the chain!

56
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.770
Why, give it to my wifeand fetch your money.

57
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.300
Come, come, you know Igave it you even now.

58
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.270
Either send the chain orsend me by some token.

59
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.630
Fie, now you run thishumour out of breath,

60
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.800
Come, where's the chain? I prayyou, let me see it.

61
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.770
My business cannot brookthis dalliance.

62
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.870
Good sir, say whetheryou'll answer me or no:

63
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.770
If not, I'll leave him tothe officer.

64
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.830
I answer you! what shouldI answer you?

65
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.800
The money that you owe mefor the chain.

66
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.100
I owe you none till Ireceive the chain.

67
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.300
You know I gave it youhalf an hour since.

68
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.530
You gave me none: youwrong me much to say so.

69
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.000
You wrong me more, sir, indenying it:

70
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.900
Consider how it standsupon my credit.

71
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.200
Well, officer, arrest himat my suit.

72
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.570
I do; and charge you in theduke's name to obey me.

73
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.530
This touches me inreputation.

74
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.330
Either consent to pay thissum for me

75
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.870
Or I attach you by thisofficer.

76
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.430
Consent to pay thee that Inever had!

77
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.830
Arrest me, foolish fellow,if thou darest.

78
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.500
Here is thy fee; arresthim, officer,

79
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.270
I would not spare mybrother in this case,

80
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.130
If he should scorn me soapparently.

81
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.870
I do arrest you, sir: youhear the suit.

82
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.830
I do obey thee till I givethee bail.

83
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.070
But, sirrah, you shall buythis sport as dear

84
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.100
As all the metal in yourshop will answer.

85
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.700
Sir, sir, I will have lawin Ephesus,

86
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.930
To your notorious shame; Idoubt it not.

87
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.870
Master, there is a bark ofEpidamnum

88
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.030
That stays but till herowner comes aboard,

89
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.630
And then, sir, she bearsaway. Our fraughtage, sir,

90
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.970
I have convey'd aboard;and I have bought

91
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.370
The oil, the balsamum andaqua-vitae.

92
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.670
The ship is in her trim;the merry wind

93
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.230
Blows fair from land: theystay for nought at all

94
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.670
But for their owner,master, and yourself.

95
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.800
How now! a madman! Why,thou peevish sheep,

96
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.500
What ship of Epidamnumstays for me?

97
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.970
A ship you sent me to, tohire waftage.

98
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.970
Thou drunken slave, I sentthee for a rope;

99
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.300
And told thee to whatpurpose and what end.

100
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.470
You sent me for a rope'send as soon:

101
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.370
You sent me to the bay,sir, for a bark.

102
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.670
I will debate this matterat more leisure

103
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.530
And teach your ears tolist me with more heed.

104
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.670
To Adriana, villain, hiethee straight:

105
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.330
Give her this key, andtell her, in the desk

106
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.670
That's cover'd o'er withTurkish tapestry,

107
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.770
There is a purse ofducats; let her send it:

108
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.030
Tell her I am arrested inthe street

109
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.830
And that shall bail me;hie thee, slave, be gone!

110
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.470
On, officer, to prisontill it come.

111
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.830
To Adriana! that is wherewe dined,

112
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.530
Where Dowsabel did claimme for her husband:

113
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.700
She is too big, I hope,for me to compass.

114
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.570
Thither I must, althoughagainst my will,

115
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.230
For servants must theirmasters' minds fulfil.

116
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.670
Ah, Luciana, did he temptthee so?

117
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.970
Mightst thou perceiveausterely in his eye

118
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.630
That he did plead inearnest? yea or no?

119
00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:03.900
Look'd he or red or pale,or sad or merrily?

120
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.870
What observation madestthou in this case

121
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.870
Of his heart's meteorstilting in his face?

122
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.000
First he denied you had inhim no right.

123
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.170
He meant he did me none;the more my spite.

124
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.030
Then swore he that he wasa stranger here.

125
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.830
And true he swore, thoughyet forsworn he were.

126
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.730
Then pleaded I for you.

127
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.000
And what said he?

128
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.700
That love I begg'd for youhe begg'd of me.

129
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.770
With what persuasion didhe tempt thy love?

130
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.670
With words that in anhonest suit might move.

131
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.970
First he did praise mybeauty, then my speech.

132
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.170
Didst speak him fair?

133
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.970
Have patience, I beseech.

134
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.470
I cannot, nor I will not,hold me still;

135
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.270
My tongue, though not myheart, shall have his will.

136
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.530
He is deformed, crooked,old and sere,

137
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.800
Ill-faced, worse bodied,shapeless everywhere;

138
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.900
Vicious, ungentle,foolish, blunt, unkind;

139
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.230
Stigmatical in making,worse in mind.

140
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.170
Who would be jealous thenof such a one?

141
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.170
No evil lost is wail'dwhen it is gone.

142
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.430
Ah, but I think him betterthan I say,

143
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.770
And yet would hereinothers' eyes were worse.

144
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.400
Far from her nest thelapwing cries away:

145
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.530
My heart prays for him,though my tongue do curse.

146
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.670
Here! go; the desk, the purse!sweet, now, make haste.

147
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.600
How hast thou lost thybreath?

148
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.700
By running fast.

149
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.830
Where is thy master,Dromio? is he well?

150
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.730
No, he's in Tartar limbo,worse than hell.

151
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.800
A devil in an everlastinggarment hath him;

152
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.000
One whose hard heart isbutton'd up with steel;

153
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.270
A fiend, a fury, pitilessand rough;

154
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.870
A wolf, nay, worse, afellow all in buff;

155
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.430
A back-friend, ashoulder-clapper,

156
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.430
one that countermands

157
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.730
The passages of alleys,creeks and narrow lands;

158
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.970
A hound that runs counterand yet draws dryfoot well;

159
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.000
One that before thejudgement

160
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.670
carries poorsouls to hell.

161
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.730
Why, man, what is thematter?

162
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.930
I do not know the matter:he is 'rested on the case.

163
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:37.570
What, is he arrested? Tellme at whose suit.

164
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.170
I know not at whose suithe is arrested well;

165
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:42.470
But he's in a suit of buffwhich 'rested him,

166
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.130
that can I tell.

167
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.200
Will you send him,mistress, redemption,

168
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.670
the money in his desk?

169
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.500
Go fetch it, sister.

170
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.800
This I wonder at,

171
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.230
That he, unknown to me,should be in debt.

172
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.630
Tell me, was he arrestedon a band?

173
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.530
Not on a band, but on astronger thing;

174
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.330
A chain, a chain! Do younot hear it ring?

175
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.830
What, the chain?

176
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.870
No, no, the bell: 'tistime that I were gone:

177
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.130
It was two ere I left him, andnow the clock strikes one.

178
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.600
The hours come back! thatdid I never hear.

179
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.430
O, yes; if any hourmeet a sergeant,

180
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.300
a' turns back for very fear.

181
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.230
As if Time were in debt! howfondly dost thou reason!

182
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.330
Time is a very bankrupt,and owes more

183
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.800
than he's worth, to season.

184
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.530
Nay, he's a thief too:have you not heard men say

185
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:36.500
That Time comes stealingon by night and day?

186
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.900
If Time be in debt andtheft,

187
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.070
and a sergeant inthe way,

188
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.300
Hath he not reason to turnback an hour in a day?

189
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.770
Go, Dromio; there's themoney, bear it straight;

190
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.570
And bring thy master homeimmediately.

191
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:59.270
Come, sister: I am press'ddown with conceit--

192
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:04.170
Conceit, my comfort and myinjury.

193
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.130
There's not a man I meetbut doth salute me

194
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.970
As if I were theirwell-acquainted friend;

195
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.900
And every one doth call meby my name.

196
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.770
Some tender money to me;some invite me;

197
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.170
Some other give me thanksfor kindnesses;

198
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.330
Some offer me commoditiesto buy:

199
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.800
Even now a tailor call'dme in his shop

200
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.130
And show'd me silks thathe had bought for me,

201
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.300
And therewithal tookmeasure of my body.

202
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.000
Sure, these are butimaginary wiles

203
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.500
And Lapland sorcerersinhabit here.

204
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.830
Master, here's thegold you sent me for.

205
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:14.600
What, have you got the pictureof old Adam new-apparelled?

206
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.500
What gold is this? whatAdam dost thou mean?

207
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.730
Not that Adam that keptthe Paradise but that Adam

208
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.200
that keeps the prison: hethat goes in the calf's skin

209
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.670
that was killed forthe Prodigal; he that

210
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.970
came behind you, sir, likean evil angel, and bid you

211
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.700
forsake your liberty.

212
00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.670
I understand thee not.

213
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.200
No? why, 'tis a plaincase: he that went,

214
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.430
like a bass-viol, in a caseof leather; the man, sir,

215
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.400
that, when gentlemen aretired, gives them a sob

216
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.000
and 'rests them; he,sir, that takes pity

217
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.770
on decayed men and gives themsuits of durance;

218
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.470
he that sets up his rest

219
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.200
to do more exploits with hismace than a morris-pike.

220
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.670
What, thou meanest anofficer?

221
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.500
Ay, sir, the sergeantof the band,

222
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.870
he that brings any manto answer

223
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.100
it that breaks his band;

224
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.000
one that thinks a man alwaysgoing to bed, and says,

225
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.730
'God give you good rest!'

226
00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.370
Well, sir, there restin your foolery.

227
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.730
Is there any ship puts forthtonight? May we be gone?

228
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.300
Why, sir, I brought youword an hour since

229
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.930
that the bark Expeditionput forth to-night;

230
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.600
and then were youhindered by the sergeant,

231
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.830
to tarry for the hoy delay.

232
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.930
Here are the angels that yousent for to deliver you.

233
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.770
The fellow is distract,and so am I;

234
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.370
And here we wander inillusions:

235
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.870
Some blessed power deliverus from hence!

236
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.670
Master Antipholus.Well met, well met.

237
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.830
I see, sir, you have foundthe goldsmith now:

238
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.300
Is that the chain youpromised me to-day?

239
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:46.730
Satan, avoid! I chargethee, tempt me not.

240
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:48.930
Master, is this MistressSatan?

241
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.470
It is the devil.

242
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.270
Nay, she is worse, sheis the devil's dam;

243
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.470
and here she comes in thehabit of a light wench:

244
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.100
and thereof comes that thewenches say 'God damn me;'

245
00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.070
that's as much to say 'Godmake me a light wench.'

246
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:06.570
It is written, they appear tomen like angels of light:

247
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:10.970
light is an effect offire, and fire will burn;

248
00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:15.730
ergo, light wenches willburn. Come not near her.

249
00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:19.670
Your man and you aremarvellous merry, sir.

250
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.730
Will you go with me? We'llmend our dinner here?

251
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.070
Master, if you do,expect spoon-meat;

252
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.630
or bespeak a long spoon.

253
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.030
Why, Dromio?

254
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.000
Marry, he must have along spoon

255
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.370
that must eat withthe devil.

256
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.530
Avoid then, fiend! whattell'st thou me of supping?

257
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.200
Thou art, as you are all,a sorceress:

258
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.230
I conjure thee to leave meand be gone.

259
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:43.170
Give me the ring of mineyou had at dinner,

260
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.700
Or, for my diamond, thechain you promised,

261
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.970
And I'll be gone, sir, andnot trouble you.

262
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.300
Some devils ask but theparings of one's nail,

263
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.170
A rush, a hair, a drop ofblood, a pin,

264
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.130
A nut, a cherry-stone;

265
00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:02.670
But she, more covetous,would have a chain.

266
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.130
Master, be wise: an if yougive it her,

267
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.070
The devil will shake herchain and fright us with it.

268
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:14.000
I pray you, sir, my ring,or else the chain:

269
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.500
I hope you do not mean tocheat me so.

270
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:21.170
Avaunt, thou witch! Come,Dromio, let us go.

271
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.600
'Fly pride,' says thepeacock:

272
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.800
mistress, that you know.

273
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:41.070
Now, out of doubtAntipholus is mad,

274
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:45.370
Else would he never sodemean himself.

275
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.570
A ring he hath of mineworth forty ducats,

276
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.730
And for the same hepromised me a chain:

277
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:55.430
Both one and other hedenies me now.

278
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.070
The reason that I gatherhe is mad,

279
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.270
Besides this presentinstance of his rage,

280
00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:04.000
Is a mad tale he toldto-day at dinner,

281
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.130
Of his own doors beingshut against his entrance.

282
00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.130
Belike his wife,acquainted with his fits,

283
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.730
On purpose shut the doorsagainst his way.

284
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:17.470
My way is now to hie hometo his house,

285
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.200
And tell his wife that,being lunatic,

286
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.600
He rush'd into my houseand took perforce

287
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.430
My ring away. This courseI fittest choose;

288
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.600
For forty ducats is toomuch to lose.

289
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.870
Fear me not, man; I willnot break away:

290
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.300
I'll give thee, ere Ileave thee, so much money,

291
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.070
To warrant thee, as I am'rested for.

292
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.800
My wife is in a waywardmood to-day,

293
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.630
And will not lightly trustthe messenger

294
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.630
That I should be attach'din Ephesus,

295
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.900
I tell you, 'twill soundharshly in her ears.

296
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.130
Here comes my man; I thinkhe brings the money.

297
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.370
How now, sir! have youthat I sent you for?

298
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.300
Here's that, I warrantyou, will pay them all.

299
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.370
But where's the money?

300
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.270
Why, sir, I gave the moneyfor the rope.

301
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:16.400
Five hundred ducats,villain, for a rope?

302
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.400
I'll serve you, sir, fivehundred at the rate.

303
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.030
To what end did I bid theehie thee home?

304
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.000
To a rope's-end, sir; andto that end am I returned.

305
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.030
And to that end, sir, Iwill welcome you.

306
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:31.800
Good sir, be patient.

307
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.400
Nay, 'tis for me to bepatient; I am in adversity.

308
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.600
Good, now, hold thytongue.

309
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.870
Nay, rather persuade himto hold his hands.

310
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:42.170
Thou whoreson, senselessvillain!

311
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.730
I would I weresenseless, sir,

312
00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.800
that I might notfeel your blows.

313
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.300
Thou art sensible innothing but blows,

314
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.870
and so is an ass.

315
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.970
I am an ass, indeed; you mayprove it by my long ears.

316
00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.830
I have served him fromthe hour of my nativity

317
00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.400
to this instant,and have nothing

318
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.800
at his hands for my servicebut blows.

319
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.900
When I am cold, heheats me with beating;

320
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.330
when I am warm, hecools me with beating;

321
00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.030
I am waked withit when I sleep;

322
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.530
raised with it when Isit; driven out of doors

323
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:16.100
with it when I go from home;welcomed home with it

324
00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.230
when I return; nay, Ibear it on my shoulders,

325
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.930
as a beggar wont her brat;

326
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.530
and, I think whenhe hath lamed me,

327
00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.700
I shall beg with it fromdoor to door.

328
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.970
Come, go along; my wife iscoming yonder.

329
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.100
Mistress, 'respice finem,'respect your end;

330
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.930
or rather, the prophecylike the parrot,

331
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.170
'beware the rope's-end.'

332
00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.170
Wilt thou still talk?

333
00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.400
How say you now? is notyour husband mad?

334
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.270
His incivility confirms noless.

335
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.670
Good Doctor Pinch, you area conjurer;

336
00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.300
Establish him in his truesense again,

337
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.770
And I will please you whatyou will demand.

338
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.930
Alas, how fiery and howsharp he looks!

339
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.530
Mark how he trembles inhis ecstasy!

340
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:07.500
Give me your hand and letme feel your pulse.

341
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.330
There is my hand, and letit feel your ear.

342
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.470
I charge thee, Satan,housed within this man,

343
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:18.700
To yield possession to myholy prayers

344
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.200
And to thy state ofdarkness hie thee straight:

345
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.070
I conjure thee by all thesaints in heaven!

346
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.970
Peace, doting wizard,peace! I am not mad.

347
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.770
O, that thou wert not,poor distressed soul!

348
00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:36.700
You minion, you, are theseyour customers?

349
00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.100
Did this companion withthe saffron face

350
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.170
Revel and feast it at myhouse to-day,

351
00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.100
Whilst upon me the guiltydoors were shut

352
00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.230
And I denied to enter inmy house?

353
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:49.630
O husband, God doth knowyou dined at home;

354
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.430
Where would you hadremain'd until this time,

355
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:55.430
Free from these slandersand this open shame!

356
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.000
Dined at home!

357
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:07.930
Thou villain, whatsayest thou?

358
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:13.300
Sir, sooth to say, you didnot dine at home.

359
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.700
Were not my doors lock'dup and I shut out?

360
00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.800
Perdie, your doors werelock'd and you shut out.

361
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.170
And did not she herselfrevile me there?

362
00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:26.000
Sans fable, she herselfreviled you there.

363
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.870
Did not her kitchen-maidrail, taunt, and scorn me?

364
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.500
Certes, she did; thekitchen-vestal scorn'd you.

365
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.100
And did not I in ragedepart from thence?

366
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.100
In verity you did; mybones bear witness,

367
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.700
That since have felt thevigour of his rage.

368
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.870
Is't good to soothe him inthese contraries?

369
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:54.230
It is no shame: the fellowfinds his vein,

370
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:58.430
And yielding to himhumours well his frenzy.

371
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:04.100
Thou hast suborn'd thegoldsmith to arrest me.

372
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:09.830
Alas, I sent you money toredeem you,

373
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:12.630
By Dromio here, who camein haste for it.

374
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:17.900
Money by me! heart andgoodwill you might;

375
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.600
But surely master, not arag of money.

376
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.170
Went'st not thou to herfor a purse of ducats?

377
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.300
He came to me and Ideliver'd it.

378
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.300
And I am witness with herthat she did.

379
00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.830
God and the rope-makerbear me witness

380
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.630
That I was sent fornothing but a rope!

381
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:43.700
Mistress, both man andmaster is possess'd;

382
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:48.100
I know it by their paleand deadly looks:

383
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.470
They must be bound andlaid in some dark room.

384
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.500
Say, wherefore didst thoulock me forth to-day?

385
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.830
And why dost thou deny thebag of gold?

386
00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:02.870
I did not, gentle husband,lock thee forth.

387
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:07.930
And, gentle master, Ireceived no gold;

388
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.100
But I confess, sir, thatwe were lock'd out.

389
00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.570
Dissembling villain, thouspeak'st false in both.

390
00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.200
Dissembling harlot, thouart false in all;

391
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.300
And art confederate with adamned pack

392
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.330
To make a loathsome abjectscorn of me:

393
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.970
But with these nails I'llpluck out these false eyes

394
00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.630
That would behold in methis shameful sport.

395
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:29.770
O, bind him, bind him! lethim not come near me.

396
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.730
More company! The fiend isstrong within him.

397
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:36.800
Ay me, poor man, how paleand wan he looks!

398
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.330
What, will you murder me?Thou gaoler, thou,

399
00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.130
I am thy prisoner: wiltthou suffer them

400
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:42.200
To make a rescue?

401
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.330
Masters, let him go

402
00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:45.700
He is my prisoner, and youshall not have him.

403
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:50.630
Go bind this man, for heis frantic too.

404
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:54.030
What wilt thou do, thoupeevish officer?

405
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.570
Hast thou delight to see awretched man

406
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.330
Do outrage and displeasureto himself?

407
00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.400
He is my prisoner: if Ilet him go,

408
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.630
The debt he owes will berequired of me.

409
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.370
I will discharge thee ereI go from thee:

410
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:05.870
Bear me forthwith unto hiscreditor,

411
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.130
And, knowing how the debtgrows, I will pay it.

412
00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:12.600
Good master doctor, seehim safe convey'd

413
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.030
Home to my house. O mostunhappy day!

414
00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:20.530
O most unhappy strumpet!

415
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.400
Master, I am here enteredin bond for you.

416
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:28.270
Out on thee, villain!wherefore dost thou mad me?

417
00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.400
Will you be bound fornothing? be mad, good master:

418
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.400
cry 'The devil!'

419
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.130
God help, poor souls, howidly do they talk!

420
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.070
Go bear him hence. Sister,go you with me.

421
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.670
Say now, whose suit is hearrested at?

422
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:57.630
One Angelo, a goldsmith:do you know him?

423
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.300
I know the man. What isthe sum he owes?

424
00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.800
Two hundred ducats.

425
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.300
Say, how grows it due?

426
00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.000
Due for a chain yourhusband had of him.

427
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.070
He did bespeak a chain forme, but had it not.

428
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.630
When as your husband allin rage to-day

429
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.300
Came to my house and tookaway my ring--

430
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.930
The ring I saw upon hisfinger now--

431
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.700
Straight after did I meethim with a chain.

432
00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:22.200
It may be so, but I didnever see it.

433
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.100
Come, gaoler, bring mewhere the goldsmith is:

434
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.330
I long to know the truthhereof at large.

435
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.130
God, for thy mercy! theyare loose again.

436
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:32.200
And come with nakedswords.

437
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.930
Let's call more help tohave them bound again.

438
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.730
Away! they'll kill us.

439
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.430
I see these witches areafraid of swords.

440
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:42.970
She that would be yourwife now ran from you.

441
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.770
Come to the Centaur; fetchour stuff from thence:

442
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.730
I long that we were safeand sound aboard.

443
00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:51.200
Faith, stay here this night;

444
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.270
they will surely do usno harm:

445
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:57.400
you saw they speak usfair, give us gold:

446
00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.600
methinks they are sucha gentle nation that,

447
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.000
but for the mountain of madflesh

448
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.330
that claims marriage of me,

449
00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:04.830
I could find in my heart

450
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.770
to stay here stilland turn witch.

451
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.830
I will not stay to-nightfor all the town;

452
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:11.030
Therefore away, to get ourstuff aboard.

453
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.300
