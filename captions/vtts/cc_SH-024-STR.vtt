00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:01.230


2
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.200
Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptialhour draws on apace.

3
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.330
Four happy days bring in anothermoon,

4
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.300
but oh, methinks, how slow thisold moon wanes.

5
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.430
She lingers my desires like to astep-dame or a dowager

6
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.130
long withering out a young man'srevenue.

7
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.470
Four days will quickly steepthemselves in night.

8
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.330
Four nights will quickly dreamaway the time.

9
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.400
Then the moon, like to a silverbow new bent in heaven,

10
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.900
shall behold the night of oursolemnities.

11
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.000
Go, Philostrate, stir up theAthenian youth to merriments.

12
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.600
Awake the pert and nimble spiritof mirth.

13
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.530
Turn melancholy forth tofunerals.

14
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.830
The pale companion is not forour pomp.

15
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.870
Hippolyta, I wooed thee with mysword

16
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.730
and won thy love doing theinjuries.

17
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.200
But I will wed thee in anotherkey,

18
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.530
with pomp, with triumph, andwith revelling.

19
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.370
Happy be Theseus, our renownedDuke.

20
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.500
Thanks, good Egeus.

21
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.470
What's the news with thee?

22
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.930
Full of vexation come I

23
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.900
with complaint against my child,my daughter Hermia.

24
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.270
My noble lord, this man,Demetrius, hath my consent tomarry her.

25
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.470
And, my gracious Duke, this man,Lysander,

26
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.830
hath bewitched the bosom of mychild.

27
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.670
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hasgiven her rhymes

28
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.670
and interchanged love tokenswith my child.

29
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.470
Thou hast by moonlight at herwindow

30
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.230
sung with feigning voice versesof feigning love

31
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.800
and stolen the impression of herfantasy.

32
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.870
With cunning hath thou filchedmy daughter's heart,

33
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.730
turned her obedience, which isdue to me,

34
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.600
to stubborn harshness.

35
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.530
And, my gracious Duke, be it soshe will not here before yourgrace

36
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.270
consent to marry with Demetrius,

37
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.670
I beg the ancient privilege ofAthens.

38
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.630
As she is mine, I may dispose ofher,

39
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.300
which shall be either to thisgentleman or to her death,

40
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.470
according to our law immediatelyprovided in that case.

41
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.730
What says thou, Hermia?

42
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.230
Be advised, fair maid: To you,your father should be as a god,

43
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.200
one that composed your beauties,

44
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.300
yea, and one to whom you are butas a form in wax

45
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.470
by him imprinted and within hispower

46
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.670
to leave the figure or disfigureit.

47
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.770
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.

48
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.000
So is Lysander.

49
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.270
In himself, he is.

50
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.970
But in this kind, wanting yourfather's voice,

51
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.900
the other must be held to be theworthier.

52
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.500
I would my father looked butwith my eyes.

53
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.570
Rather, your eyes must with hisjudgment look.

54
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.730
I do entreat your grace topardon me.

55
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.230
I know not by what power I ammade bold,

56
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.400
nor how it may concern mymodesty

57
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.470
in such a presence here to pleadmy thoughts,

58
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.270
but I beseech your grace that Imay know

59
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.400
the worst that may befall me inthis case

60
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.470
if I refuse to wed Demetrius.

61
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.100
Either to die the death

62
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.130
or to abjure forever the societyof men.

63
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.300
Therefore, fair Hermia, questionyour desires,

64
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.770
know of your youth, examine wellyour blood,

65
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.470
whether, if you yield not toyour father's choice,

66
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.030
you can endure the livery of anun,

67
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.300
for aye to be in shady cloistermewed,

68
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.700
to live a barren sister all yourlife,

69
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.970
chanting faint hymns to thecold, fruitless moon.

70
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.070
Thrice-blessed they that masterso their blood,

71
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.330
to undergo such maidenpilgrimage,

72
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.170
but earthlier happy is the rosedistilled

73
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.000
than that which withering on thevirgin thorn grows,

74
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.300
lives, and dies in singleblessedness.

75
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.330
So will I grow, so live, so die,my lord.

76
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.430
Ere I will yield my virginpatent up unto his lordship,

77
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.900
whose unwished yoke my soulconsents not to givesovereignty.

78
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.200
Take time to pause, and, by thenext new moon--

79
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.230
the sealing-day betwixt my loveand me

80
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.470
for everlasting bond offellowship--

81
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.000
upon that day, either prepare todie

82
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.870
for disobedience to yourfather's will

83
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.700
or else to wed Demetrius, as hewould,

84
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.030
or on Diana's altar to protest

85
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.400
for aye austerity and singlelife.

86
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.700
Relent, sweet Hermia.

87
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.430
And, Lysander, yield thy crazedtitle to my certain right.

88
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.630
You have her father's love,Demetrius.

89
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.330
Let me have Hermia's.

90
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.030
Do you marry him?

91
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.900
Scornful Lysander, true, he hathmy love.

92
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.400
And what is mine my love shallrender him.

93
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.730
And she is mine, and all myright of her

94
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.330
I do estate unto Demetrius.

95
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.570
I am, my lord, as well derivedas he,

96
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.830
as well possessed.

97
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.270
My love is more than his.

98
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.300
My fortunes every way as fairlyranked,

99
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.670
if not with vantage, asDemetrius'.

100
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.430
And, which is more than allthese boasts can be,

101
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.830
I am beloved of beauteousHermia.

102
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.200
Why should not I then prosecutemy right?

103
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.970
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to hishead,

104
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.900
made love to Nedar's daughter,Helena,

105
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.300
and won her soul.

106
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.400
And she, sweet lady, dotes,devoutly dotes,

107
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.700
dotes in idolatry, upon thisspotted and inconstant man.

108
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.700
I must confess that I have heardas much,

109
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.030
and with Demetrius thought tohave spoke thereof,

110
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.900
but, being over-full ofself-affairs,

111
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.670
my mind did lose it.

112
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.330
But, Demetrius, come.

113
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.600
And come, Egeus, you shall gowith me.

114
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.530
I have some private schoolingfor you both.

115
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.370
For you, fair Hermia, look youarm yourself

116
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.100
to fit your fancies to yourfather's will,

117
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.170
or else the law of Athens yieldsyou up--

118
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.370
which by no means we mayextenuate--

119
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.200
to death or to a vow of singlelife.

120
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.500
How now, my love?

121
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.200
Why is your cheek so pale?

122
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.470
How chance the roses there dofade so fast?

123
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.170
Belike for want of rain, which Icould well beteem them

124
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.030
from the tempest of my eyes.

125
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.400
Ay me.

126
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.530
For aught that I could everread,

127
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.330
could ever hear by tale orhistory,

128
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
the course of true love neverdid run smooth.

129
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.730
But, either it was different inblood--

130
00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:57.930
Oh cross,

131
00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.730
too high to be enthralled toolow.

132
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.870
Or else misgraffed in respect ofyears.

133
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.100
Oh, spite.

134
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.300
Too old to be engaged to young.

135
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.330
Or else it stood upon the choiceof friends.

136
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.630
Oh, hell.

137
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.270
To choose love by another'seyes.

138
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.530
Or, if there were a sympathy inchoice,

139
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.100
war, death, or sickness did laysiege to it,

140
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.100
making it momentary as a sound,

141
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.500
swift as a shadow, short as anydream,

142
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.170
brief as the lightning in thecollied night.

143
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.700
Ere a man hath power to say"Behold,"

144
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.670
the jaws of darkness do devourit up,

145
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.070
So quick bright things come toconfusion.

146
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.900
If then true lovers have beenever crossed,

147
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.930
it stands as an edict indestiny.

148
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.770
let us teach our trial patience,

149
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.900
because it is a customary cross

150
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:51.070
as due to love as thoughts anddreams and sighs,

151
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:56.970
wishes and tears, poor fancy'sfollowers.

152
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.370
A good persuasion.

153
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.270
Therefore, hear me, Hermia.

154
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:10.300
I have a widow aunt, a dowagerof great revenue,

155
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.600
and she hath no child.

156
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.700
From Athens is her house remoteseven leagues.

157
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.500
And she respects me as her onlyson.

158
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.730
There, gentle Hermia, may Imarry thee,

159
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:25.170
And to that place the sharpAthenian law cannot pursue us.

160
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.000
If thou lovest me then,

161
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.370
steal forth thy father's housetomorrow night,

162
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.330
and in the wood, a leaguewithout the town,

163
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.170
where I did meet thee once withHelena

164
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.970
to do observance to a morn ofMay,

165
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.370
there will I stay for thee.

166
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.500
My good Lysander.

167
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.870
I swear to thee, by Cupid'sstrongest bow,

168
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.970
by his best arrow with thegolden head,

169
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.300
by the simplicity of Venus'doves,

170
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.670
by that which knitteth souls andprospers loves,

171
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.200
and by that fire which burnedthe Carthage queen,

172
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.270
when the false Troyan under sailwas seen,

173
00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.800
by all the vows that ever menhave broke,

174
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.230
in number more than ever womanspoke.

175
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.670
At that same place thou hastappointed me,

176
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.670
tomorrow truly will I meet withthee.

177
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.170
God speed, fair Helena.

178
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.070
Call you me fair?

179
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.670
That fair again unsay.

180
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.700
Demetrius loves your fair.

181
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.630
Oh, happy fair.

182
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.330
Your eyes are lodestars,

183
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.930
and your tongue's sweet air moretunable

184
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.800
than lark to shepherd's ear whenwheat is green,

185
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.900
when hawthorn buds appear.

186
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.130
Sickness is catching.

187
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.330
Oh, were favour so,

188
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.530
yours would I catch, fairHermia, ere I go.

189
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:56.530
My ear should catch your voice,my eye your eye,

190
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.400
my tongue should catch yourtongue's sweet melody.

191
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.030
Were the world mine, Demetriusbeing bated,

192
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.670
the rest I'd give to be to youtranslated.

193
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.530
Oh, teach me how you look

194
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.130
and with what art you sway themotion of Demetrius' heart.

195
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.230
I frown upon him, yet he lovesme still.

196
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.170
Oh that your frowns would teachmy smiles such skill.

197
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.530
I give him curses, yet he givesme love.

198
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.970
Oh, that my prayers could suchaffection move.

199
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.300
The more I hate, the more hefollows me.

200
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.200
The more I love, the more hehateth me.

201
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.930
His folly, Helena, is no faultof mine.

202
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.800
None but your beauty.

203
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.070
Oh, would that fault were mine.

204
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.500
Take comfort. He no more shallsee my face.

205
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.370
Lysander and myself shall flythis place.

206
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.230
Before the time I did Lysandersee,

207
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.000
seemed Athens as a paradise tome.

208
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.530
Oh, then, what graces in my lovedo dwell

209
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.000
that he hath turned a heavenunto a hell.

210
00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:00.070
Helen, to you our minds we willunfold.

211
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.800
Tomorrow night, when Phoebe dothbehold

212
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.130
her silver visage in the wateryglass,

213
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.470
decking with liquid pearl thebladed grass,

214
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:13.230
a time that lovers' flights dothstill conceal,

215
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.730
through Athens' gates we havedevised to steal.

216
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.000
And in that wood,

217
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.830
where often you and I upon faintprimrose beds were wont to lie,

218
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.900
emptying our bosoms of theircounsel sweet,

219
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.630
there my Lysander and myselfshall meet

220
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.870
and thence from Athens turn awayour eyes

221
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:31.770
to seek new friends and strangercompanies.

222
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.270
Farewell, sweet playfellow.

223
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.530
Pray thou for us.

224
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.570
And good luck grant thee thyDemetrius.

225
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.430
How happy some o'er other somecan be.

226
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.900
Through Athens, I am thought asfair as she.

227
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.100
But what of that?

228
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.130
Demetrius thinks not so.

229
00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.500
He will not know what all but hedo know.

230
00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.700
And as he errs, doting onHermia's eyes,

231
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.700
so I, admiring of his qualities.

232
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.770
Things base and vile, holding noquantity

233
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.370
love can transpose to form anddignity.

234
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.130
Love looks not with the eyes,but with the mind,

235
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.970
and therefore is winged Cupidpainted blind.

236
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.000
Nor hath love's mind of anyjudgment taste.

237
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.130
Wings and no eyes figure unheedyhaste.

238
00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.370
And therefore is love said to bea child,

239
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.100
because in choice, he is so oftbeguiled.

240
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.770
As waggish boys in gamethemselves forswear,

241
00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:33.630
so the boy Love is perjuredeverywhere.

242
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.500
For ere Demetrius looked onHermia's eyne,

243
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.030
he hailed down oaths that he wasonly mine.

244
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:50.200
And when this hail some heatfrom Hermia felt,

245
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.570
so he dissolved, and showers ofoaths did melt.

246
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.270
I will go tell him of fairHermia's flight,

247
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:09.100
then to the wood will hetomorrow night pursue her.

248
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.800
And for this intelligence if Ihave thanks,

249
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.200
it is a dear expense.

250
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.100
But herein mean I to enrich mypain,

251
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.400
to have his sight thither andback again.

252
00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.230
Is all our company here?

253
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.070
You would best to call themgenerally,

254
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.030
man by man, according to thescript.

255
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.370
Here is the scroll of everyman's name

256
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.330
which is thought fit, throughall Athens,

257
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.270
to play in our interlude beforethe duke and the duchess

258
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.000
on his wedding day at night.

259
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.500
First, good Peter Quince, saywhat the play treats on,

260
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.670
then read the names of theactors and so grow to a point.

261
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:53.270
Marry, our play is the mostlamentable comedy

262
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.530
and most cruel death of Pyramusand Thisbe.

263
00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.270
A very good piece of work, Iassure you, and a merry.

264
00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.130
Now, good Peter Quince, callforth your actors by the scroll.

265
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.530
Masters, spread yourselves.

266
00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:03.630
Answer as I call you.

267
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:04.830
Nick Bottom, the weaver.

268
00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.070
Ready.

269
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.730
Name what part I am for andproceed.

270
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.770
You, Nick Bottom, are set downfor Pyramus.

271
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.330
What is Pyramus, a lover, or atyrant?

272
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.930
A lover that kills himself mostgallant for love.

273
00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.400
That will ask some tears in thetrue performing of it.

274
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.830
If I do it, let the audiencelook to their eyes.

275
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.530
I will move storms.

276
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.670
I will condole in some measure.

277
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.100
To the rest.

278
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.770
Yet my chief humour is for atyrant.

279
00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.670
I could play Ercles rarely, or apart to tear a cat in,

280
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.200
to make all split.

281
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.070
The raging rocks and shiveringshocks

282
00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.030
shall break the locks of prisongates.

283
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:42.130
And Phibbus' car shall shinefrom far

284
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:46.030
and make and mar the foolishfates.

285
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.370
This was lofty.

286
00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:48.870
Now name the rest of theplayers.

287
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.700
This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant'svein.

288
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.930
A lover is more condoling.

289
00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:53.670
Francis Flute, thebellows-maker.

290
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:54.770
Here, Peter Quince.

291
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.600
Flute, you must take Thisbe onyou.

292
00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.170
What is Thisbe, a wanderingknight?

293
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.470
It is the lady that Pyramus mustlove.

294
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.700
Nay, faith, let not me play awoman.

295
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.800
I have a beard coming.

296
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.030
That's all one.

297
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.270
You shall play it in a mask.

298
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.200
And you may speak as small asyou will.

299
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.300
And I may hide my face.

300
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.670
Let me play Thisbe too.

301
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.530
I'll speak in a monstrous littlevoice.

302
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.070
"Thisne, Thisne."

303
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.070
"Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear."

304
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:21.670
"Thy Thisbe dear, and ladydear."

305
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.330
No, no, no, you must playPyramus,

306
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.000
and, Flute, you Thisbe.

307
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.000
Well, proceed.

308
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.670
Robin Starveling, the tailor.

309
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.400
Here, Peter Quince.

310
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.170
Robin Starveling, you mustplay...

311
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.530
Thisbe's mother.

312
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.130
Tom Snout, the tinker.

313
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.230
Here, Peter Quince.

314
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.330
You, Pyramus' father.

315
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.730
and myself, Thisbe's father.

316
00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.870
Oh, and Snug the joiner, you,the lion's part.

317
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.730
And, I hope, here is a playfitted.

318
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.430
Have you the lion's partwritten?

319
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.870
Pray you, if it be, give it me,for I am slow of study.

320
00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.000
You may do it extempore, forit's nothing but roaring.

321
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.430
Let me play the lion too.

322
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.670
I will roar that it will do anyman good to hear me.

323
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.600
I will roar that it will makethe duke say,

324
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.430
"Let him roar again. Let himroar again!"

325
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.070
And you should do it tooterribly,

326
00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:15.130
you would fright the duchess andthe ladies that they wouldshriek.

327
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.800
And that were enough to hang usall.

328
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.670
That would hang us, everymother's son.

329
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:19.770
I grant you, friends,

330
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.070
if you should fright the ladiesout of their wits,

331
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:24.370
they would have no morediscretion but to hang us,

332
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:26.700
but I will aggravate my voice sothat I will roar you

333
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.130
as gently as any sucking dove.

334
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:31.070
I will roar you an 'twere anynightingale.

335
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.670
You can play no part butPyramus,

336
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.870
for Pyramus is a sweet-facedman,

337
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.130
a proper man, as one shall seein a summer's day,

338
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.630
a most lovely gentleman-likeman.

339
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.730
Therefore you must needs playPyramus.

340
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.700
Well, I will undertake it.

341
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.100
Masters, here are your parts.

342
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.170
And I am to entreat you, requestyou, and desire you

343
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.700
to con them by tomorrow night

344
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.000
and meet me in the palace wood,a mile without the town, bymoonlight.

345
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.870
There will we rehearse,

346
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:19.570
for if we meet in the city, wewill be dogged with company,

347
00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.270
and our devices known.

348
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.730
In the meantime, I will draw abill of properties,

349
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:25.170
such as our play wants.

350
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.670
I pray you, fail me not.

351
00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:29.170
We will meet,

352
00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:33.230
and there we may rehearse mostobscenely and courageously.

353
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.900
Take pains; Be perfect.

354
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:38.370
Adieu.

355
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.600
Hold or cut bow-strings.

356
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.830
How now, spirit!

357
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.100
Whither wander you?

358
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.730
Over hill, over dale, thoroughbush, thorough brier,

359
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.300
over park, over pale, thoroughflood, thorough fire,

360
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.400
I do wander everywhere swifterthan the moon's sphere.

361
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.870
And I serve the fairy queen, todew her orbs upon the green.

362
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.970
The cowslips tall her pensionersbe.

363
00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:00.970
In their gold coats spots yousee.

364
00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.300
Those be rubies, fairy favours.

365
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.230
In those freckles live theirsavours.

366
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.800
I must go seek some dewdropshere

367
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.930
and hang a pearl in everycowslip's ear.

368
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.630
Farewell, thou lob of spirits.

369
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:11.830
I'll be gone.

370
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.170
Our queen and all her elves comehere anon.

371
00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:56.170
The king doth keep his revelshere to-night.

372
00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.930
Take heed the queen come notwithin his sight,

373
00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.530
for Oberon is passing fell andwrath,

374
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.700
because that she as herattendant

375
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.570
hath a lovely boy stolen from anIndian king.

376
00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.200
She never had so sweet achangeling.

377
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.100
And jealous Oberon would havethe child knight of his train

378
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.830
to trace the forests wild,

379
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:18.600
but she perforce withholds theloved boy,

380
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.730
crowns him with flowers andmakes him all her joy.

381
00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:24.630
Either I mistake your shape andmaking quite,

382
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.900
or else you are that shrewd andknavish sprite

383
00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.130
called Robin Goodfellow.

384
00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:29.230
Thou speakest aright.

385
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.000
I am that merry wanderer of thenight.

386
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.300
I jest to Oberon and make himsmile

387
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.300
when I a fat and bean-fed horsebeguile,

388
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.700
neighing in likeness of a fillyfoal.

389
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.470
And sometimes lurk I in agossip's bowl,

390
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.770
in very likeness of a roastedcrab.

391
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.870
And when she drinks, against herlips I bob

392
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.270
and on her withered dewlap pourthe ale.

393
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.600
The wisest aunt, telling thesaddest tale,

394
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.330
sometime for three-foot stoolmistaketh me.

395
00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.000
Then slip I from her bum.

396
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.130
Down topples she.

397
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.470
But, room, fairy, here comesOberon.

398
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.070
Ill met by moonlight, proudTitania.

399
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.300
What?

400
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.570
Jealous Oberon.

401
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:08.230
Fairies, skip hence.

402
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.830
I have forsworn his bed andcompany.

403
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.270
Tarry, rash wanton.

404
00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.100
Am not I thy lord?

405
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.770
Then I must be thy lady,

406
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:22.200
but I know when thou hast stolenaway from fairy land

407
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.900
and in the shape of Corin satall day playing on pipes of corn

408
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.530
and versing love to amorousPhillida.

409
00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:34.200
Why art thou here, come from thefarthest steppe of India,

410
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.570
but that, forsooth, the bouncingAmazon,

411
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.700
your buskin'd mistress and yourwarrior love

412
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.300
to Theseus must be wedded,

413
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.470
and you come to give their bedjoy and prosperity.

414
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.500
How canst thou thus for shame,Titania,

415
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.930
glance at my credit withHippolyta,

416
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.600
knowing I know thy love toTheseus?

417
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.030
Didst thou not lead him throughthe glimmering night

418
00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.970
from Perigenia, whom heravished?

419
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.330
And make him with fair Aeglebreak his faith,

420
00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.630
with Ariadne and Antiopa?

421
00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.900
These are the forgeries ofjealousy.

422
00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.170
And never, since the middlesummer's spring,

423
00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.470
met we on hill, in dale, forestor mead,

424
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:10.500
by paved fountain or by rushybrook,

425
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.230
or in the beached margent of thesea,

426
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.300
to dance our ringlets to thewhistling wind,

427
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.830
but with thy brawls thou hastdisturbed our sport.

428
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:25.330
Therefore, the wind, piping tous in vain as in revenge,

429
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.800
have sucked up from the seacontagious fogs,

430
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.170
which falling in the land,

431
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.330
have every pelting river made soproud

432
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:35.130
that they have overborne theircontinents.

433
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.530
The ox hath therefore stretchedhis yoke in vain,

434
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:38.930
the ploughman lost his sweat,

435
00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:42.170
and the green corn hath rottedere his youth attained a beard.

436
00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.500
The fold stands empty in thedrowned field,

437
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.730
and crows are fatted with themurrion flock.

438
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:51.730
The nine men's morris is filledup with mud,

439
00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.670
and the quaint mazes in thewanton green for lack of tread

440
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:57.100
are undistinguishable.

441
00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.700
The human mortals want theirwinter cheer.

442
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.330
No night is now with hymn orcarol blessed.

443
00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:09.300
Therefore, the moon, thegoverness of floods,

444
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.670
pale in her anger, washes allthe air

445
00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.800
that rheumatic diseases doabound.

446
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.630
And thorough this distemperaturewe see the seasons alter,

447
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:21.700
hoary-headed frosts far in thefresh lap of the crimson rose,

448
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.670
and on old Hiems' thin and icycrown,

449
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.370
an odorous chaplet of sweetsummer buds

450
00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:29.400
is, as in mockery, set.

451
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.530
The spring, the summer, thechilding autumn,

452
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.970
angry winter, change theirwonted liveries,

453
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.830
and the mazed world, by theirincrease,

454
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.900
knows not now which is which.

455
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:45.530
And this same progeny of evilscomes from our debate,

456
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:47.630
from our dissension.

457
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.270
We are their parents andoriginal.

458
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.570
Do you amend it then?

459
00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:53.070
It lies in you.

460
00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:55.400
Why should Titania cross herOberon?

461
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.970
I do but beg a little changelingboy to be my henchman.

462
00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:01.570
Set your heart at rest.

463
00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.900
The fairy land buys not thechild of me.

464
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:10.900
His mother was a votaress of myorder.

465
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:15.500
And, in the spiced Indian air bynight,

466
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.630
full often hath she gossiped bymy side

467
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.630
and sat with me on Neptune'syellow sands,

468
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.870
marking the embarked traders onthe flood

469
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:26.770
where we have laughed to see thesails

470
00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:30.830
conceive and grow big-belliedwith the wanton wind, which she,

471
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:34.670
with pretty and with swimminggait following--

472
00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:38.200
her womb then rich with my youngsquire--

473
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.500
would imitate and sail upon theland

474
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.770
to fetch me trifles and returnagain as from a voyage,

475
00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:47.670
rich with merchandise.

476
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:53.130
But she, being mortal, of thatboy did die.

477
00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:57.170
And for her sake do I rear upher boy.

478
00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:03.000
And for her sake, I will notpart with him.

479
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.030
Give me that boy.

480
00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:09.030
Not for thy fairy kingdom.

481
00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.830
Fairies, away.

482
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.470
We shall chide downright if Ilonger stay.

483
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:15.870
Well, go thy way.

484
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:19.130
Thou shalt not from this grovetill I torment thee for thisinjury.

485
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:27.170
My gentle Puck, come hither.

486
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.930
Thou rememberest since once Isat upon a promontory

487
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.230
and heard a mermaid on adolphin's back

488
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.970
uttering such dulcet andharmonious breath

489
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.230
that the rude sea grew civil ather song

490
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:39.900
and certain stars shot madlyfrom their spheres

491
00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.400
to hear the sea-maid's music.

492
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.500
I remember.

493
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.370
That very time I saw, but thoucouldst not,

494
00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:47.700
flying between the cold moon andthe earth,

495
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.730
Cupid all armed.

496
00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:53.630
A certain aim he took at a fairvestal throned by the west

497
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.270
and loosed his love-shaftsmartly from his bow

498
00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:58.700
as it should pierce a hundredthousand hearts.

499
00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.130
But I might see young Cupid'sfiery shaft

500
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:04.370
quenched in the chaste beams ofthe watery moon,

501
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:10.600
and the imperial votaress passedon, in maiden meditation,

502
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.930
fancy-free.

503
00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:15.330
Yet marked I where the bolt ofCupid fell.

504
00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.130
It fell upon a little westernflower,

505
00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:22.730
before milk-white, now purplewith love's wound.

506
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:25.830
And maidens call itlove-in-idleness.

507
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.570
Fetch me that flower, the herb Ishewed thee once.

508
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.430
The juice of it on sleepingeyelids laid

509
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.170
will make all man or woman madlydote

510
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.100
upon the next live creature thatit sees.

511
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.270
Fetch me this herb, and be thouhere again

512
00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.100
ere the leviathan can swim aleague.

513
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.900
I'll put a girdle round aboutthe earth in forty minutes.

514
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.100
Having once this juice,

515
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.800
I'll watch Titania when she isasleep

516
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.600
and drop the liquor of it in hereyes.

517
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.230
The next thing then she wakinglooks upon,

518
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:56.070
be it on lion, bear, or wolf, orbull,

519
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.670
on meddling monkey, or on busyape,

520
00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:01.770
she shall pursue it with thesoul of love.

521
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.800
And ere I take this charm fromoff her sight,

522
00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.600
as I can take it with anotherherb,

523
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.100
I'll make her render up her pageto me.

524
00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:13.600
Who comes here?

525
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.070
I am invisible, and I willoverhear their conference.

526
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.670
Where is Lysander and fairHermia?

527
00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.230
Thou toldest me they were stolenunto this wood.

528
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.730
Hence, get thee gone and followme no more.

529
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.070
Do I entice you?

530
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.870
Do I speak you fair?

531
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.700
Or rather, do I not, in plainesttruth,

532
00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:55.530
tell you I do not, nor I cannot,love you?

533
00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:59.730
And even for that do I love youthe more.

534
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.000
I am your spaniel.

535
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.470
And, Demetrius, the more youbeat me,

536
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:05.970
I will fawn on you.

537
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.900
Use me but as your spaniel;spurn me; strike me;

538
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.570
neglect me; lose me.

539
00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:14.900
Only give me leave, unworthy asI am, to follow you.

540
00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.970
What worser place can I beg inyour love--

541
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:20.230
and yet a place of high respectwith me--

542
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:23.370
than to be used as you use yourdog?

543
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:26.100
Tempt not too much the hatred ofmy spirit,

544
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.170
for I am sick when I do look onthee.

545
00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:31.500
And I am sick when I look not onyou.

546
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.230
You do impeach your modesty toomuch

547
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:35.000
to leave the city and commityourself

548
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.870
into the hands of one that lovesyou not,

549
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:40.030
to trust the opportunity ofnight and the ill counsel of adesert place

550
00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:41.870
with the rich worth of yourvirginity.

551
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.470
Your virtue is my privilege.

552
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.930
For that it is not night when Ido see your face.

553
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:49.800
Therefore, I think I am not inthe night,

554
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.730
nor doth this wood lack worldsof company,

555
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.770
for you, in my respect, are allthe world.

556
00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.270
Then how can it be said I amalone

557
00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.930
when all the world is here tolook on me?

558
00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:02.030
I will not stay thy questions.

559
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.200
Let me go.

560
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.930
Or, if thou follow me, do notbelieve

561
00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:06.800
but I shall do thee mischief inthe wood.

562
00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.000
Ay, in the temple, in the town,the field, you do me mischief.

563
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.370
Fie, Demetrius!

564
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.500
Your wrongs do set a scandal onmy sex.

565
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.430
We cannot fight for love as menmay do.

566
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:18.400
We should be wooed and were notmade to woo.

567
00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.470
I'll run from thee, and hide mein the breaks,

568
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.330
and leave thee to the mercy ofwild beasts.

569
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:29.170
I'll follow thee and make aheaven of hell,

570
00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:31.670
to die upon the hand I love sowell.

571
00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:33.100
Fare thee well, nymph.

572
00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.730
Ere he do leave this grove,

573
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.300
thou shalt fly him, and he shallseek thy love.

574
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.970
Hast thou the flower there?

575
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.700
Welcome, wanderer.

576
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.270
Ay, there it is.

577
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.330
I pray thee, give it me.

578
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.700
I know a bank where the wildthyme blows,

579
00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.630
where oxlips and the noddingviolet grows

580
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:58.070
quite over-canopied withluscious woodbine,

581
00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:02.200
with sweet musk-roses and witheglantine.

582
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.830
There sleeps Titania sometime ofthe night,

583
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:08.300
lulled in these flowers withdances and delight.

584
00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.900
And there the snake throws herenamelled skin,

585
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.830
weed wide enough to wrap a fairyin.

586
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:19.130
And with the juice of this, I'llstreak her eyes

587
00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:22.570
and make her full of hatefulfantasies.

588
00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:25.970
Take thou some of it and seekthrough this grove.

589
00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.970
A sweet Athenian lady is in lovewith a disdainful youth.

590
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:30.100
Anoint his eyes,

591
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.030
but do it when the next thing heespies may be the lady.

592
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:37.700
Thou shalt know the man by theAthenian garments he hath on.

593
00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.700
Effect it with some care,

594
00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.000
that he may prove more fond onher

595
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.600
than she upon her love.

596
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.900
Sing me now asleep

597
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:57.570
then to your offices and let merest.

598
00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:08.730
You spotted snakes with doubletongue.

599
00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:18.070
Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen.

600
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:27.470
Newts and blind-worms, do nowrong.

601
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:32.470
Come not near our fairy queen.

602
00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:36.070
Come not near our fairy queen,

603
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:41.730
our fairy queen.

604
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:48.600
Philomel, with melody, sing inour sweet lullaby.

605
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.930
Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla,lulla, lullaby.

606
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:54.100
Never harm, nor spell nor charm,

607
00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.000
come our lovely lady nigh.

608
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.830
So good night with lullaby.

609
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:59.700
So good night with lullaby.

610
00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:01.670
So good night with lullaby.

611
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.100
So good night

612
00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.700
with lullaby, lullaby, lullaby.

613
00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:11.170
Weaving spiders, come not here.

614
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:16.500
Hence, you long-legged spinners,hence.

615
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:23.930
Beetles black, approach notnear.

616
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:33.070
Worm nor snail, do no offense.

617
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:41.170
Worm nor snail, do no offense.

618
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:46.730
Philomel, with melody, sing inour sweet lullaby.

619
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:50.330
Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla,lulla, lullaby.

620
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:52.200
Never harm, nor spell nor charm,

621
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.170
come our lovely lady nigh.

622
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:56.030
So good night with lullaby.

623
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.030
So good night with lullaby.

624
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:59.870
So good night with lullaby.

625
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:01.430
So good night

626
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.530
with lullaby, lullaby, lullaby.

627
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.300
Hence, away.

628
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.170
Now all is well.

629
00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:11.430
One aloof stand sentinel.

630
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:22.900
What thou seest when thou dostwake,

631
00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.800
do it for thy true-love take,

632
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.070
love and languish for his sake,

633
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:33.000
be it ounce, or cat, or bear,pard,

634
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.570
or boar with bristled hair

635
00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:37.130
in thy eye that shall appearwhen thou wakest,

636
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:40.270
it is thy dear.

637
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:47.700
Wake when some vile thing isnear.

638
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:55.270
Fair love, you faint withwandering in the wood.

639
00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:59.970
And to speak troth, I haveforgot our way.

640
00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.700
We'll rest us, Hermia, if youthink it good,

641
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.170
and tarry for the comfort of theday.

642
00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:10.900
Be it so, Lysander.

643
00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.630
Find you out a bed, for I uponthis bank will rest my head.

644
00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.900
One turf shall serve as pillowfor us both,

645
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:21.100
one heart, one bed, two bosomsand one troth.

646
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.070
Nay, good Lysander,

647
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.700
for my sake, my dear, liefurther off.

648
00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.100
Do not lie so near.

649
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:36.000
Oh, take the sense, sweet, of myinnocence.

650
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.670
Love takes the meaning in love'sconference.

651
00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:42.170
I mean, that my heart unto yoursis knit

652
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:46.300
so that one heart we can make ofit,

653
00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.100
two bosoms interchained with anoath

654
00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:54.300
so then two bosoms and a singletroth.

655
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.530
Then by your side no bedroom medeny.

656
00:34:56.530 --> 00:35:01.300
For lying so, Hermia, I do notlie.

657
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.300
Lysander riddles very prettily.

658
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.730
Now much beshrew my manners andmy pride

659
00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:07.770
if Hermia meant to say Lysanderlied.

660
00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:12.270
But, gentle friend, for love andcourtesy lie further off.

661
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:13.900
In human modesty,

662
00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:17.330
such separation as may well besaid

663
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:20.970
becomes a virtuous bachelor anda maid.

664
00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.370
So far be distant.

665
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:25.530
And, good night, sweet friend.

666
00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:30.630
Thy love ne'er alter till thysweet life end.

667
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:45.300
Amen, amen to that fair prayer,say I.

668
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.930
So end life when I end loyalty.

669
00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:00.230
Here is my bed.

670
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:06.000
Sleep give thee all his rest.

671
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.200
With half that wish, thewisher's eyes be pressed.

672
00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.500
Through the forest have I gone,

673
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:18.000
but Athenian found I none onwhose eyes I might approve

674
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.600
this flower's force in stirringlove.

675
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.570
Night and silence.

676
00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:24.700
Who is here?

677
00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.430
Weeds of Athens he doth wear.

678
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:33.570
This is he, my master said,despised the Athenian maid.

679
00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:39.000
And here the maiden sleepingsound on the dank and dirtyground.

680
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.300
Pretty soul,

681
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:44.630
She durst not lie near thislack-love, this kill-courtesy.

682
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:50.670
Churl, upon thy eyes I throw allthe power this charm doth owe.

683
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.970
When thou wakest, let loveforbid.

684
00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:57.700
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid.

685
00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:01.770
So awake when I am gone, for Imust now to Oberon.

686
00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:04.700
Stay, though thou kill me, sweetDemetrius.

687
00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:11.330
I charge thee, hence, and do nothaunt me thus.

688
00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:12.900
Oh, wilt thou darkling leave me?

689
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.100
Do not so.

690
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.600
Stay, on thy peril.

691
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.270
I alone will go.

692
00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:39.100
Oh, I am out of breath in thisfond chase.

693
00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:42.030
The more my prayer, the lesseris my grace.

694
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.530
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er shelies,

695
00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:51.100
for she hath blessed andattractive eyes.

696
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.870
How came her eyes so bright?

697
00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:58.900
Not with salt tears.

698
00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.230
If so, my eyes are oftenerwashed than hers.

699
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:16.830
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear.

700
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:20.500
For beasts that meet me run awayfor fear.

701
00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.630
Therefore no marvel thoughDemetrius do

702
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:26.530
as a monster fly my presencethus.

703
00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:29.970
What wicked and dissemblingglass of mine

704
00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:32.900
made me compare with Hermia'ssphery eyne?

705
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:38.830
But who is here?

706
00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.470
Lysander on the ground!

707
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:45.030
Dead?

708
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:47.830
Or asleep?

709
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:50.530
I see no blood, no wound.

710
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:54.070
Lysander, if you live, good sir,awake.

711
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:57.300
And run through fire will I forthy sweet sake.

712
00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.830
Transparent Helena!

713
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:03.130
Nature shows art,

714
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:06.300
that through thy bosom makes mesee thy heart.

715
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.500
Where is Demetrius?

716
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:12.830
Oh, how fit a word is that vilename to perish on my sword.

717
00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:16.570
Do not say so, Lysander.

718
00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:21.170
Say not so what though he loveyour Hermia?

719
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:22.530
Lord, what though?

720
00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:25.730
Yet Hermia still loves you, thenbe content.

721
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:28.800
Content with Hermia.

722
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:35.400
No, I do repent the tediousminutes I with her have spent.

723
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.070
Not Hermia but Helena I love.

724
00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:43.200
Who will not change a raven fora dove?

725
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.930
The will of man is by his reasonswayed.

726
00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:48.900
And reason says you are theworthier maid.

727
00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.700
Things growing are not ripeuntil their season,

728
00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.870
so I, being young, till now ripenot to reason.

729
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:58.800
And touching now the point ofhuman skill,

730
00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.900
reason becomes the marshal to mywill

731
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:04.470
and leads me to your eyes,

732
00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:12.230
where I o'erlook love's storieswritten in love's richest book.

733
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:18.530
Wherefore was I to this keenmockery born?

734
00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:23.400
When at your hand did I deservethis scorn?

735
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.830
It's not enough-- it's notenough, young man,

736
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.930
that I did never, no, nor nevercan,

737
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:32.330
deserve a sweet look fromDemetrius' eye,

738
00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:34.670
but you must flout myinsufficiency?

739
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:35.970
Good troth, you do me wrong.

740
00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:40.230
Good sooth, you do, in suchdisdainful manner me to woo.

741
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.900
But fare you well.

742
00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.300
Perforce, I must confess

743
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:51.270
I thought you lord of more truegentleness.

744
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:54.000
Oh, that a lady, of one manrefused

745
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.730
should of another therefore beabused.

746
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.700
She sees not Hermia.

747
00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.200
Hermia, sleep thou there

748
00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.200
and never mayst thou comeLysander near.

749
00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.830
For all my powers, address yourlove and might

750
00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:17.570
to honour Helen and to be herknight.

751
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:24.300
Ay me, for pity!

752
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.400
What a dream was here.

753
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.830
Lysander, look how I do quakewith fear.

754
00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:34.370
Methought a serpent ate my heartaway

755
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:39.300
and you sat smiling at his cruelpray.

756
00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.930
Lysander?

757
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.100
What, removed?

758
00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:55.030
Lysander!

759
00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:00.270
Lord!

760
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.470
What, out of hearing?

761
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:05.870
Gone?

762
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:10.300
No sound,

763
00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.830
no word?

764
00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.370
Alack, where are you?

765
00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:18.570
Speak, and if you hear,

766
00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:20.830
speak, of all loves.

767
00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:22.600
I swoon almost with fear.

768
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:27.770
No?

769
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:32.530
Then I well perceive you are notnigh.

770
00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:39.900
Either death or you I'll findimmediately.

771
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:22.300
Here's a marvellous convenientplace for our rehearsal.

772
00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.900
And we will do it in action aswe will do it before the duke.

773
00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.000
Peter Quince.

774
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.500
What sayest thou, bully Bottom?

775
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.930
There are things in this comedyof Pyramus and Thisbe

776
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:31.200
that will never please.

777
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.800
First, Pyramus must draw a swordto kill himself,

778
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.270
which the ladies cannot abide.

779
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:37.530
How answer you that?

780
00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:38.830
By'r lakin, a parlous fear.

781
00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:41.430
I believe we must leave thekilling out, when all is done.

782
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:43.400
Not a whit. I have a device tomake all well.

783
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.000
Write me a prologue.

784
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.470
Let the prologue seem to say

785
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:48.400
that we will do no harm with ourswords

786
00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.230
and that Pyramus is not killedindeed.

787
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:51.830
And for the more betterassurance,

788
00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:53.970
tell them that I, Pyramus, amnot Pyramus,

789
00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:55.400
but Bottom the weaver.

790
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.800
This will put them out of fear.

791
00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.470
Well, we will have such aprologue,

792
00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:00.400
and it shall be written in eightand six.

793
00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.670
No, let it be two more.

794
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:03.330
Let it be written in eight andeight.

795
00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:05.300
Will the ladies not be afeard ofthe lion?

796
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.570
I fear it, I promise you.

797
00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:08.900
Masters, you ought to considerwith yourselves.

798
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.330
To bring in-- God shield us--

799
00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:12.400
a lion among ladies is a mostdreadful thing,

800
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:15.330
for there is not a more fearfulwild-fowl than your lion living.

801
00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:16.800
And we ought to look to it.

802
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.530
Therefore, another prologueshould tell it that he's not alion.

803
00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:21.170
Nay, you must name his name.

804
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:23.670
And half his face must be seenthrough the lion's neck.

805
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:25.230
And he himself must speakthrough

806
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:27.170
saying thus, or to the samedefect,

807
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:29.470
"Ladies,"--or "Fair ladies"--

808
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:32.030
"I would wish you,"-- or "Iwould request you"--

809
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:33.300
or "I would--

810
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.400
Entreat you.

811
00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.970
"I would entreat you not tofear,

812
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:37.570
"not to tremble my life foryours.

813
00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:40.330
"If you think I come hither as alion, "it were pity of my life.

814
00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:41.770
"No, I am no such thing.

815
00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:43.200
I am a man as other men are."

816
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.970
And there indeed let him namehis name

817
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:47.730
and tell them plainly he is Snugthe joiner.

818
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:49.570
Well, it shall be so.

819
00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:51.100
But there is two hard things.

820
00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:58.930
That is, to bring the moonlightinto a chamber,

821
00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:01.370
for Pyramus and Thisbe you knowmeet by moonlight.

822
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:04.070
Doth the moon shine that nightwe play our play?

823
00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:05.930
A calendar, a calendar.

824
00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:07.130
Look in the almanac.

825
00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:08.230
Find out moonshine.

826
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:09.630
Yes, it doth shine that night.

827
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:11.300
Why, then, may you leave acasement

828
00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.600
of the great chamber window,where we play, open,

829
00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.530
and the moon may shine in at thecasement.

830
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:18.800
Ay, or else one must come in

831
00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.730
with a bush of thorns and alantern,

832
00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:23.830
and say he comes to disfigure,or to present,

833
00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:26.030
the person of moonshine.

834
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:27.970
And there is another thing.

835
00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:29.830
We must have a wall in the greatchamber,

836
00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:32.500
for Pyramus and Thisbe, says thestory,

837
00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.400
did talk through the chink of awall.

838
00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.170
You can never bring in a wall.

839
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:37.900
What say you, Bottom?

840
00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.430
Some man or other must presentwall,

841
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:42.400
and let him have some plaster orsome loam

842
00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.900
or some rough-cast about him tosignify wall.

843
00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.630
And let him hold his fingersthus,

844
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:53.300
and through that cranny shallPyramus and Thisbe whisper.

845
00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.970
If that may be, then all iswell.

846
00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:59.770
Come, sit down, every mother'sson, and rehearse your parts.

847
00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:02.400
Now, Pyramus, you begin.

848
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.970
When you have spoken yourspeech,

849
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:07.670
enter into that brake,

850
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:11.170
and so every one according tohis cue.

851
00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:14.270
What hempen home-spuns have weswaggering here

852
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:17.500
so near the cradle of the fairyqueen?

853
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:20.070
What, a play toward.

854
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:22.770
I'll be an auditor, an actortoo, perhaps,

855
00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:24.100
if I see cause.

856
00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:25.800
Speak, Pyramus.

857
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.400
Thisbe, stand forth.

858
00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:35.100
Thisbe, the flowers of odioussavours sweet--

859
00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.300
Odious--Odorous!

860
00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:40.070
Odorous savors sweet,

861
00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:43.900
so hath thy breath, my dearestThisbe dear.

862
00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.430
But hark, a voice.

863
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:48.300
Stay thou but here awhile,

864
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.370
and by and by I will to theeappear.

865
00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:53.900
A stranger Pyramus than e'erplayed here.

866
00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:58.500
Must I speak now?

867
00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:02.200
Ay, marry, must you, for youmust understand

868
00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.970
he goes but to see a noise thathe heard

869
00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:05.470
and is to come again.

870
00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:10.130
Oh, most radiant Pyramus, mostlily-white of hue,

871
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:14.630
of colour like the red rose ontriumphant brier,

872
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:18.930
most brisky juvenal and eke mostlovely Jew,

873
00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:22.530
as true as truest horse that yetwould never tire,

874
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:26.000
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, atNinny's tomb.

875
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.970
"Ninus' tomb," man.

876
00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:32.970
Why, you mustn't speak that yet,that you answer to Pyramus.

877
00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:35.270
You speak all your part at once,cues and all.

878
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:36.600
Pyramus, enter.

879
00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:37.800
Your cue is past.

880
00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.030
It is, "never tire."

881
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:43.200
Oh, as true as truest horse,that yet would never tire.

882
00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:48.530
If I were fair, fair Thisbe, Iwere only thine.

883
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.400
Oh, monstrous.

884
00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.770
Oh, strange.

885
00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:57.100
We are haunted.

886
00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:58.230
Pray, masters.

887
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:59.500
Fly, masters!

888
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:00.670
Help!

889
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:02.800
I'll follow you. I'll lead youabout, around,

890
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:05.500
through bog, through bush,through brake, through brier.

891
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.530
Sometime a horse I'll be,sometime a hound,

892
00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:09.970
a hog, a headless bear,sometimes a fire

893
00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:13.500
and neigh, and bark, and grunt,and roar, and burn,

894
00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:16.300
like horse, hound, hog, bear,fire, at every turn.

895
00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:25.400
I see their knavery.

896
00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:30.670
This is to make an ass of me, tofright me if they could.

897
00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:56.600
But I will not stir from thisplace, do what they can.

898
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:04.970
I will walk up and down here,and I will sing,

899
00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:08.870
that they shall hear I am notafraid.

900
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:16.600
The ousel cock so black of huewith orange-tawny bill.

901
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:20.600
The throstle with his note sotrue.

902
00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:25.330
The wren with little quill--

903
00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:27.330
The finch, the sparrow and thelark.

904
00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:29.670
What angel wakes me from myflowery bed?

905
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:32.330
A plain-song cuckoo gray,

906
00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:35.900
whose note full many a man dothmark,

907
00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:39.970
and dares not answer nay.

908
00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:45.470
For, indeed, who would set hiswit to so foolish a bird?

909
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:50.630
Who would give a bird the lie,though it cry "cuckoo" never so?

910
00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:55.100
I pray thee, gentle mortal, singagain.

911
00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:58.530
Mine ear is much enamoured ofthy note.

912
00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:04.800
So is mine eye enthralled to thyshape.

913
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.930
And thy fair virtue's force

914
00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:08.900
perforce doth move me on thefirst view

915
00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:14.100
to say, to swear,

916
00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:17.330
I love thee.

917
00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:20.470
Methinks, mistress, you shouldhave little reason for that.

918
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:21.870
And yet, to say the truth,

919
00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:24.470
reason and love keep littlecompany together nowadays.

920
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:26.600
The more the pity that somehonest neighbours

921
00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.770
will not make them friends.

922
00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:31.430
Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.

923
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:37.200
Thou art as wise as thou artbeautiful.

924
00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.730
Not so, neither,

925
00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:41.030
but if I had wit enough to getout of this wood,

926
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:43.000
I have enough to serve mine ownturn.

927
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.670
Out of this wood do not desireto go.

928
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:47.970
Thou shalt remain here, whetherthou wilt or no.

929
00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:51.800
I am a spirit of no common rate.

930
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.870
The summer still doth tend uponmy state.

931
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:56.900
And I do love thee.

932
00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.630
Therefore, go with me.

933
00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:00.870
I'll give thee fairies to attendon thee,

934
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:05.000
and they shall fetch thee jewelsfrom the deep

935
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.870
and sing whilst thou on pressedflowers dost sleep.

936
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:11.930
And I will purge thy mortalgrossness

937
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:16.400
so that thou shalt like an airyspirit go.

938
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.900
Peaseblossom, Cobweb,

939
00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.570
Moth, and Mustardseed.

940
00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:21.670
- Ready. - And I.

941
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:22.770
- And I. - And I.

942
00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:23.970
Where shall we go?

943
00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:26.300
Be kind and courteous to thisgentleman.

944
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:29.630
Hop in his walks and gambol inhis eyes.

945
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:33.530
Feed him with apricocks anddewberries,

946
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.030
with purple grapes, green figs,and mulberries.

947
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:38.770
The honey-bags steal from thehumble-bee.

948
00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:43.170
And for night-tapers, crop theirwaxen thighs

949
00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:45.900
and light them at the fieryglow-worm's eyes,

950
00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:49.130
to have my love to bed and toarise.

951
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:52.600
And pluck the wings from paintedbutterflies

952
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:56.070
to fan the moonbeams from hissleeping eyes.

953
00:51:56.070 --> 00:52:00.470
Nod to him, elves, and do himcourtesies.

954
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:03.070
- Hail. - Hail.

955
00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:04.270
- Hail. - Hail.

956
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:06.970
I cry your worship's mercy,heartily.

957
00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:08.600
I beseech your worship's name.

958
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.700
Cobweb.

959
00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.630
I shall desire you of moreacquaintance,

960
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:12.870
good Master Cobweb.

961
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:18.300
If I cut my finger, I shall makebold with you.

962
00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:20.370
Your name, honest gentleman?

963
00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:21.630
Peaseblossom.

964
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:23.800
Good Master Peaseblossom,

965
00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.330
I shall desire you of moreacquaintance too.

966
00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:27.800
Your name, I beseech you, sir?

967
00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.930
Mustardseed.

968
00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:31.270
Good Master Mustardseed,

969
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:35.470
Your kindred had made my eyeswater ere now.

970
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:39.070
I desire your more acquaintance,good Master Mustardseed.

971
00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:41.630
Come, wait upon him.

972
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:45.070
Lead him to my bower.

973
00:52:55.870 --> 00:53:00.100
The moon methinks looks with awatery eye.

974
00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:04.870
And when she weeps, weeps everylittle flower,

975
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:07.870
lamenting some enforcedchastity.

976
00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:16.370
Tie up my love's tongue.

977
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:19.170
Bring him silently.

978
00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:48.330
How now, mad spirit!

979
00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:51.300
What night-rule now about thishaunted grove?

980
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:55.530
My mistress with a monster is inlove.

981
00:53:56.930 --> 00:54:00.330
This falls out better than Icould devise.

982
00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:23.970
Oh, why rebuke you him thatloves you so?

983
00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:25.830
Lay breath so bitter on yourbitter foe.

984
00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:27.870
Now I but chide, but I shoulduse thee worse.

985
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:30.000
For thou, I fear, hast given mecause to curse.

986
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.200
If thou hast slain Lysander inhis sleep,

987
00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.970
being o'er shoes in blood,

988
00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:37.000
plunge in the deep and kill metoo.

989
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.670
The sun was not so true unto theday as he to me.

990
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:43.330
Would he have stolen away fromsleeping Hermia?

991
00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:45.900
I'll believe as soon this wholeearth may be bored

992
00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.030
and that the moon may throughthe centre creep

993
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:50.830
and so displease her brother'snoontide with the Antipodes.

994
00:54:50.830 --> 00:54:53.200
It cannot be but thou hastmurdered him.

995
00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:57.070
So should a murderer look, sodead, so grim.

996
00:54:57.070 --> 00:54:59.100
So should the murdered look andso should I,

997
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:01.570
pierced through the heart withyour stern cruelty.

998
00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:03.830
Yet you, the murderer, look asbright, as clear

999
00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:06.330
as yonder Venus in herglimmering sphere.

1000
00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:07.630
What's this to my Lysander?

1001
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:08.970
Where is he?

1002
00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:12.200
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thougive him me?

1003
00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:16.400
I had rather give his carcass tomy hounds.

1004
00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.630
Out, dog.

1005
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:18.830
Out, cur.

1006
00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:21.330
Thou drivest me past the boundsof maiden's patience.

1007
00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:22.770
Hast thou slain him, then?

1008
00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:24.700
Henceforth be never numberedamong men.

1009
00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:27.530
Oh, once tell true, tell true,even for my sake.

1010
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:30.200
Durst thou have looked upon himbeing awake,

1011
00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.130
and hast thou killed himsleeping?

1012
00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:34.130
Oh, brave touch.

1013
00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:36.970
Could not a worm, an adder, doso much?

1014
00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:38.370
An adder did it,

1015
00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:41.330
for with doubler tongue thanthine, thou serpent, never adderstung.

1016
00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:43.370
You spend your passion on amisprised mood.

1017
00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:45.100
I am not guilty of Lysander'sblood,

1018
00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.970
nor is he dead, for aught that Ican tell.

1019
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:48.830
I pray thee, tell me then thathe is well.

1020
00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:50.700
If I could, what should I gettherefore?

1021
00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:52.200
A privilege never to see memore.

1022
00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:54.000
And from thy hated presence partI so.

1023
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.270
See me no more, whether he bedead or no.

1024
00:55:57.370 --> 00:55:59.530
ierce vein.

1025
00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:03.070
Here, therefore, for a while Iwill remain.

1026
00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:08.830
What hast thou done?

1027
00:56:08.830 --> 00:56:11.130
Thou hast mistaken quite andlaid the love-juice

1028
00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:12.530
on some true-love's sight.

1029
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:14.500
Of thy misprision must perforceensue.

1030
00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:16.800
Some true love turned and not afalse turned true.

1031
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.200
Then fate o'er-rules, that, oneman holding troth,

1032
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:22.130
a million fail, confounding oathon oath.

1033
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:24.000
About the wood go swifter thanthe wind

1034
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.730
and Helena of Athens look thoufind.

1035
00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:27.630
All fancy-sick she is and paleof cheer,

1036
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:29.970
with sighs of love that coststhe fresh blood dear.

1037
00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:32.070
By some illusion see thou bringher here.

1038
00:56:32.070 --> 00:56:34.070
I'll charm his eyes against shedo appear.

1039
00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:35.300
I go. I go.

1040
00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:38.400
Look how I go, swifter thanarrow from the Tartar's bow.

1041
00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:43.200
Flower of this purple dye hitwith Cupid's archery,

1042
00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.400
Sink in apple of his eye.

1043
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:47.700
When his love he doth espy,

1044
00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:50.800
let her shine as gloriously asthe Venus of the sky.

1045
00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:53.770
When thou wakest, if she be by,

1046
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:58.970
beg of her for remedy.

1047
00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:01.930
Captain of our fairy band,Helena is here at hand,

1048
00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:05.670
and the youth, mistook by me,pleading for a lover's fee.

1049
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:07.670
Shall we their fond pageant see?

1050
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:10.300
Lord, what fools these mortalsbe.

1051
00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:13.330
Draw aside: the noise they makewill cause Demetrius to awake.

1052
00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.000
Then will two at once woo one.

1053
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.400
That must needs be sport alone.

1054
00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:24.570
And those things do best pleaseme that befall preposterously.

1055
00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:28.230
Why should you think that Ishould woo in scorn?

1056
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:30.270
Scorn and derision never come intears.

1057
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:33.400
Look, when I vow, I weep.

1058
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.970
And vows so born, in theirnativity,

1059
00:57:35.970 --> 00:57:37.800
all truth appears.

1060
00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:41.070
How can these things in me seemscorn to you,

1061
00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:43.770
Bearing the badge of faith toprove them true?

1062
00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:46.000
You do advance your cunning moreand more.

1063
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.530
These vows are Hermia's.

1064
00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:48.770
Will you give her o'er?

1065
00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:50.700
I had no judgment when to her Iswore.

1066
00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:53.100
Nor none, in my mind, now yougive her o'er.

1067
00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:56.600
Demetrius loves her and lovesnot you.

1068
00:57:56.600 --> 00:58:05.170
Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect,divine.

1069
00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:08.600
To what, my love, shall Icompare thine eyne?

1070
00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:10.030
Crystal is muddy.

1071
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:13.170
Oh, how ripe in show thy lips,those kissing cherries,

1072
00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:14.470
tempting grow.

1073
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:15.770
Oh, spite.

1074
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:17.700
Pure congealed white, highTaurus snow,

1075
00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:19.230
Fanned with the eastern wind,

1076
00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:21.300
turns to a crow when thouholdest up thy hand.

1077
00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:24.000
I see you all are bent to setagainst me for your merriment.

1078
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.530
You are unkind, Demetrius.

1079
00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:27.000
Be not so, for you love Hermia.

1080
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.500
If you were civil, you would notdo me this much injury.

1081
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:31.300
Can you not hate me, as I knowyou do?

1082
00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.400
But you must join in souls tomock me too?

1083
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.770
You love Hermia.

1084
00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:35.930
This you know I know.

1085
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:38.230
And here, with all my good will,with all my heart,

1086
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:40.330
In Hermia's love, I yield you upmy part.

1087
00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:43.370
To vow and swear and superpraisemy parts

1088
00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:45.900
when I am sure you hate me withyour hearts.

1089
00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:48.330
You both are rivals and loveHermia.

1090
00:58:48.330 --> 00:58:51.530
In Hermia's love, I yield you upmy part.

1091
00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:53.200
And yours of Helena to mebequeath,

1092
00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.600
And now both rivals to mockHelena.

1093
00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:58.530
Whom I do love and will do tillmy death.

1094
00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:01.130
A trim exploit,

1095
00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:03.400
a manly enterprise to conjuretears up

1096
00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.430
in a poor maid's eyes with yourderision.

1097
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:08.870
If e'er I loved her, all thatlove is gone.

1098
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:11.630
Dark night, that from the eyehis function takes,

1099
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:13.600
the ear more quick ofapprehension makes.

1100
00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:16.070
And now to Helen, is it homereturned.

1101
00:59:16.070 --> 00:59:17.200
There to remain.

1102
00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.100
Helen, it is not so.

1103
00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:23.330
Never did mockers waste moreidle breath.

1104
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:26.570
Thou art not by mine eye,Lysander, found.

1105
00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:30.170
Mine ear, I thank it, brought meto thy sound.

1106
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:33.700
But why unkindly didst thouleave me so?

1107
00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:35.830
Why should he stay, whom lovedoth press to go?

1108
00:59:35.830 --> 00:59:38.230
What love could press Lysanderfrom my side?

1109
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:40.770
Lysander's love, that would notlet him bide,

1110
00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:44.430
fair Helena, who more engildsthe night

1111
00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:47.600
Than all you fiery oes and eyesof light.

1112
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:48.870
Why seekest thou me?

1113
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:51.470
Could not this make thee know

1114
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:53.530
the hate I bear thee made meleave thee so?

1115
00:59:53.530 --> 00:59:57.400
Lo, she is one of thisconfederacy

1116
00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.130
Now I perceive they haveconjoined all three

1117
01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:03.130
to fashion this false sport inspite of me.

1118
01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:06.070
Injurious Hermia,

1119
01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:07.870
most ungrateful maid,

1120
01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:10.630
Have you conspired, have youwith these contrived

1121
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:13.200
to bait me with this foulderision?

1122
01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.330
Is all the counsel that we twohave shared,

1123
01:00:15.330 --> 01:00:17.600
the sisters' vows, the hoursthat we have spent,

1124
01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.900
when we have chid thehasty-footed time for partingus.

1125
01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:24.700
Oh, is all forgot--

1126
01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:28.630
All school-days' friendship,childhood innocence?

1127
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:32.930
We, Hermia, have like twoartificial gods,

1128
01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:37.330
have with our needles createdboth one flower,

1129
01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:41.930
both on one sampler, sitting onone cushion,

1130
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:46.800
both warbling of one song, bothin one key,

1131
01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.870
as if our hands, our sides,

1132
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:51.700
voices and minds, had beenincorporate.

1133
01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:55.000
So we grew together, like...

1134
01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:01.100
to a double cherry,

1135
01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:06.000
seeming parted, but yet an unionin partition,

1136
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.800
two lovely berries moulded onone stem,

1137
01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:14.200
so, with two seeming bodies, butone heart,

1138
01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:18.530
And will you rent our ancientlove asunder,

1139
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:21.770
to join with men in scorningyour poor friend?

1140
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:24.570
It is not friendly.

1141
01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:27.000
'Tis not maidenly.

1142
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.200
Our sex, as well as I, may chideyou for it,

1143
01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:31.970
though I alone do feel theinjury.

1144
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:34.200
I am amazed at your passionatewords.

1145
01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.300
I scorn you not.

1146
01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.130
It seems that you scorn me.

1147
01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:40.100
Have you not set Lysander, as inscorn,

1148
01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.970
to follow me and praise my eyesand face?

1149
01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:44.770
And made your other love,Demetrius,

1150
01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:46.900
who even but now did spurn mewith his foot,

1151
01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:52.970
to call me goddess, nymph,divine and rare,

1152
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:56.970
precious, celestial?

1153
01:01:56.970 --> 01:01:58.900
Wherefore speaks he this to herhe hates?

1154
01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:01.100
And wherefore doth Lysander denyyour love,

1155
01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:02.800
so rich within his soul,

1156
01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.000
and tender me, forsooth,affection,

1157
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.670
but by your setting on by yourconsent?

1158
01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:12.430
What though I be not so in graceas you,

1159
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:16.430
so hung upon with love, sofortunate,

1160
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:21.100
but miserable most, to loveunloved?

1161
01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:25.900
This you should pity rather thandespise.

1162
01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:29.100
I understand not what you meanby this.

1163
01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:37.100
Ay, do, persever, counterfeitsad looks,

1164
01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:39.370
make mouths upon me when I turnmy back,

1165
01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:42.370
wink each at other, hold thesweet jest up.

1166
01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:46.370
This sport, well carried, shallbe chronicled.

1167
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:50.830
If you had any pity, grace, ormanners,

1168
01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:52.830
you would not make me such anargument.

1169
01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:54.400
But fare ye well.

1170
01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.630
No, stay, gentle Helena.

1171
01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:56.930
'Tis partly my own fault--

1172
01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:58.130
Hear my excuse.

1173
01:02:58.130 --> 01:03:00.200
Which death or absence soonshall remedy.

1174
01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.100
My life, my love, my soul, fairHelena.

1175
01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.100
Oh, excellent.

1176
01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.870
Sweet, do not scorn her so.

1177
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:10.670
If she cannot entreat, I cancompel.

1178
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:12.900
Thou canst compel no more thanshe entreat.

1179
01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:17.700
Thy threats have no morestrength than her weak prayers.

1180
01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:21.730
Helen, I love thee, by my life,I do.

1181
01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:23.870
I swear by that which I willlose for thee

1182
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:25.900
to prove him false that says Ilove thee not.

1183
01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:27.670
I say I love thee more than hecan do.

1184
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.670
If thou say so, withdraw, andprove it too.

1185
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:30.830
Quick, come!

1186
01:03:30.830 --> 01:03:32.470
Lysander, whereto tends allthis?

1187
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:33.770
Away, you Ethiope.

1188
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:35.300
Hang off, thou cat, thou burr.

1189
01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:38.970
Vile thing, let loose, or I willshake thee from me like aserpent.

1190
01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:40.700
Thy love--Ha!

1191
01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.670
Out, tawny Tartar, out!

1192
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:45.730
You loathed medicine, hatedpotion, hence!

1193
01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:46.830
Do you not jest?

1194
01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:48.230
Yes, sooth, and so do you.

1195
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:49.370
You're a tame man.

1196
01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:50.470
Go.

1197
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:52.430
Demetrius, I will keep my wordwith thee.

1198
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:55.130
I would I had your bond, for Iperceive a weak bond holds you.

1199
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:56.470
I'll not trust your word.

1200
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:58.930
What, should I hurt her, strikeher, kill her dead?

1201
01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:03.270
No, although I hate her, I'llnot harm her so.

1202
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:06.170
What, can you do me greater harmthan hate?

1203
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:07.330
Hate me?

1204
01:04:07.330 --> 01:04:09.030
Wherefore?

1205
01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:10.430
Oh me, what news, my love.

1206
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:11.900
Am not I Hermia?

1207
01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:13.030
Are not you Lysander?

1208
01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:15.330
I am as fair now as I waserewhile.

1209
01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:18.430
Since night you loved me, yetsince night you left me.

1210
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:20.570
Why, then you left me-- oh, thegods forbid--

1211
01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:22.100
in earnest, shall I say?

1212
01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:25.500
Ay, by my life, and never diddesire to see thee more.

1213
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:29.370
Therefore be out of hope, ofquestion, of doubt.

1214
01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:34.200
Be certain, nothing truer: 'tisno jest that I do hate thee

1215
01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:37.200
and love Helena.

1216
01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:46.900
Oh, me.

1217
01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.200
You juggler.

1218
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:56.430
You canker-blossom.

1219
01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:58.600
You thief of love!

1220
01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:04.070
What, have you come by night andstolen my love's heart from him?

1221
01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:07.030
What, will you tear impatientanswers from my gentle tongue?

1222
01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:08.800
Fie, fie.

1223
01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:12.430
You counterfeit, you puppet,you.

1224
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:14.430
Puppet?

1225
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:15.970
Why so?

1226
01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:19.270
Ay, that way goes the game.

1227
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:23.200
Now I perceive that she hathmade compare between ourstatures.

1228
01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.400
She hath urged her height, andwith her personage,

1229
01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.400
her tall personage, her height,forsooth,

1230
01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.800
she hath prevailed with him.

1231
01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.770
I pray you, though you mock me,gentlemen,

1232
01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:33.870
let her not hurt me.

1233
01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:35.670
And are you grown so high in hisesteem

1234
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:36.800
because I am so--

1235
01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.930
dwarfish--

1236
01:05:37.930 --> 01:05:39.030
And so low?

1237
01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:40.370
I was never cursed.

1238
01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:42.330
I have no gift at all inshrewishness.

1239
01:05:42.330 --> 01:05:46.600
How low am I, thou paintedmaypole?

1240
01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:47.800
Speak.

1241
01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.400
How low am I?

1242
01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.700
I am a right maid for mycowardice.

1243
01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:55.130
I am not yet so low but that mynails can reach unto thine eyes.

1244
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:56.700
Let her not strike me.

1245
01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:58.900
You perhaps may think becauseshe is something

1246
01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:00.800
lower than myself that I canmatch her.

1247
01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:01.900
Lower! Hark, again.

1248
01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:03.800
Good Hermia, do not be so bitterwith me.

1249
01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.600
I evermore did love you, Hermia,did ever keep your counsels,

1250
01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:07.730
never wronged you.

1251
01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:09.500
Save that, in love untoDemetrius,

1252
01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.430
I told him of your stealth untothis wood.

1253
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:12.600
AAHH!

1254
01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.130
He followed you.

1255
01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:15.430
For love, I followed him,

1256
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:17.600
but he hath chid me hence andthreatened me

1257
01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.930
to spurn me, strike me, nay, tokill me too.

1258
01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:30.800
And now, so you will let mequiet go.

1259
01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:35.630
To Athens will I bear my follyback and follow you no further.

1260
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:38.330
Let me go.

1261
01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:40.970
You see how simple and how fondI am.

1262
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:42.370
Why, get you gone.

1263
01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:43.700
Who is it that hinders you?

1264
01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:47.000
A foolish heart that I leavehere behind.

1265
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.370
What, with Lysander?

1266
01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:50.670
No, with Demetrius.

1267
01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:53.270
Ooh, when she's angry, she iskeen and shrewd.

1268
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:55.500
She was a vixen when she went toschool,

1269
01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.030
and though she be but little,she is fierce.

1270
01:06:58.030 --> 01:06:59.130
"Little" again.

1271
01:06:59.130 --> 01:07:00.770
Nothing but "low" and "little."

1272
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:02.670
Why will you suffer her to floutme thus?

1273
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:03.770
Let me come to her.

1274
01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:05.030
Get you gone, you dwarf,

1275
01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:08.330
you minimus of hinderingknot-grass made,

1276
01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:12.170
you bead, you acorn!

1277
01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:14.470
Let her alone.

1278
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:16.800
Speak not of Helena.

1279
01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.070
Take not her part.

1280
01:07:18.070 --> 01:07:20.630
For, if thou dost intend neverso little show of love to her,

1281
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:21.970
thou shalt aby it.

1282
01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:23.070
Now she holds me not.

1283
01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:26.400
Now follow, if thou darest, totry whose right

1284
01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.770
of thine or mine, is most inHelena.

1285
01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:30.900
Follow?

1286
01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:36.200
Nay, I'll go with thee, cheek byjowl.

1287
01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:40.530
You, mistress, all this coil islong of you.

1288
01:07:40.530 --> 01:07:43.130
I will not trust you, I,

1289
01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:46.030
nor longer stay in your cursedcompany.

1290
01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:50.100
Your hands than mine are quickerfor a fray.

1291
01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:54.030
My legs are longer though, torun away.

1292
01:07:54.030 --> 01:07:57.630
I am amazed and know not what tosay.

1293
01:07:57.630 --> 01:08:01.400
This is thy negligence stillthou mistakest

1294
01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.830
or else committest thy knaverieswillfully.

1295
01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:09.230
Believe me, king of shadows, Imistook.

1296
01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:11.130
Did not you tell me I shouldknow the man

1297
01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:13.030
by the Athenian garments he hadon?

1298
01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:15.830
And so far blameless proves myenterprise

1299
01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:18.100
that I have 'nointed anAthenian's eyes.

1300
01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:21.130
And so far, am I glad it so didsort

1301
01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:23.530
as this their jangling I esteema sport.

1302
01:08:23.530 --> 01:08:25.800
Thou seest these lovers seek aplace to fight.

1303
01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.730
Hie therefore, Robin, overcastthe night.

1304
01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:30.170
The starry welkin cover

1305
01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:32.770
thou anon with drooping fog asblack as Acheron

1306
01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:35.600
and lead these testy rivals soastray

1307
01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.800
as one come not within another'sway.

1308
01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:40.200
Like to Lysander sometime framethy tongue.

1309
01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.170
Then stir Demetrius upwithbitter wrong.

1310
01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:45.130
And sometime rail thou likeDemetrius.

1311
01:08:45.130 --> 01:08:47.200
And from each other look thoulead them thus,

1312
01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.730
till o'er their browsdeath-counterfeiting sleep

1313
01:08:49.730 --> 01:08:52.230
with leaden legs and batty wingsdoth creep,

1314
01:08:52.230 --> 01:08:55.300
Then crush this herb intoLysander's eye,

1315
01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:57.670
whose liquor hath this virtuousproperty

1316
01:08:57.670 --> 01:09:00.300
to take from thence all errorwith his might

1317
01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:02.930
and make his eyeballs roll withwonted sight.

1318
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.270
When they next wake, all thisderision

1319
01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:07.600
shall seem a dream and fruitlessvision

1320
01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.530
and back to Athens shall thelovers wend,

1321
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:12.530
with league whose date tilldeath shall never end.

1322
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:14.570
Whiles I in this affair do theeemploy,

1323
01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:16.970
I'll to my queen and beg herIndian boy.

1324
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:19.870
And then I will her charmed eyerelease

1325
01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:21.570
from monster's view,

1326
01:09:21.570 --> 01:09:23.600
and all things shall be peace.

1327
01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:26.000
My fairy lord, this must be donewith haste,

1328
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
for night's swift dragons cutthe clouds full fast,

1329
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.170
and yonder shines Aurora'sharbinger

1330
01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:33.730
at whose approach ghostswandering here and there

1331
01:09:33.730 --> 01:09:36.430
troop home to churchyards,damned spirits

1332
01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:38.400
that in crossways and floodshave burial,

1333
01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.330
already to their wormy beds aregone.

1334
01:09:40.330 --> 01:09:42.970
For fear lest day should looktheir shames upon,

1335
01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:45.400
they willfully themselves exilefrom light

1336
01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.730
and must for aye consort withblack-browed night.

1337
01:09:47.730 --> 01:09:51.000
But we are spirits of anothersort.

1338
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.130
I with the morning's love haveoft made sport.

1339
01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:55.230
And, like the forester, thegroves may tread

1340
01:09:55.230 --> 01:09:58.200
even till the eastern gate, allfiery-red,

1341
01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.930
opening on Neptune with fairblessed beams,

1342
01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:04.370
turns into yellow gold his saltgreen streams.

1343
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:05.930
But, notwithstanding, haste.

1344
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:07.100
Make no delay.

1345
01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:09.170
We may effect this business yetere day.

1346
01:10:10.770 --> 01:10:16.430
Up and down, up and down, I willlead them up and down.

1347
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:19.000
I am feared in field and town.

1348
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.970
Goblin, lead them up and down.

1349
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:25.500
Here comes one.

1350
01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.270
Where art thou now, proudDemetrius?

1351
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:28.530
Speak thou now.

1352
01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:29.630
Here, villain.

1353
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:30.800
Drawn and ready.

1354
01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:31.900
Where art thou?

1355
01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:33.270
I will be with thee straight.

1356
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:35.430
Follow me, then, to plainerground.

1357
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:36.770
Lysander, speak again.

1358
01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.200
Thou runaway, thou coward, artthou fled?

1359
01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.300
Speak!

1360
01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:42.530
In some bush?

1361
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:44.100
Where dost thou hide thy head?

1362
01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:47.430
Thou coward, art thou braggingto the stars,

1363
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:49.570
telling the bushes that thoulookest for wars

1364
01:10:49.570 --> 01:10:50.770
and wilt not come?

1365
01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:53.500
Come, recreant; Come, thouchild.

1366
01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.030
I'll whip thee with a rod.

1367
01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:58.330
He is defiled that draws a swordon thee.

1368
01:10:58.330 --> 01:10:59.570
Yea, art thou there?

1369
01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:00.730
Follow my voice.

1370
01:11:00.730 --> 01:11:03.730
We'll try no manhood here.

1371
01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:06.300
He goes before me and stilldares me on.

1372
01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:10.600
When I come where he calls, thenhe is gone.

1373
01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.730
The villain is muchlighter-heeled than I.

1374
01:11:12.730 --> 01:11:15.530
I followed fast, but faster hedid fly,

1375
01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:19.230
that fallen am I in dark unevenway

1376
01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:23.100
and here will rest me.

1377
01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:25.170
Come, thou gentle day.

1378
01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:29.830
For if but once thou show me thygrey light,

1379
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:32.970
I'll find Demetrius and revengethis spite.

1380
01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:34.400
Ho, ho, ho!

1381
01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.170
Coward, why comest thou not?

1382
01:11:36.170 --> 01:11:38.030
Abide me, if thou darest, forwell I wot.

1383
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:40.170
Thou runnest before me, shiftingevery place

1384
01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:42.200
and darest not stand nor look mein the face.

1385
01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:44.030
Where art thou now?

1386
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:45.770
Come hither; I am here.

1387
01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:52.230
Nay, then, thou mockest me.

1388
01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:55.430
Thou shalt buy this dear if everI thy face by daylight see:

1389
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:59.300
Now go thy way.

1390
01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:01.070
Faintness constraineth me

1391
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:04.200
to measure out my length on thiscold bed.

1392
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.230
Oh weary night,

1393
01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:09.930
Oh long and tedious night.

1394
01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:12.300
Abate thy hours.

1395
01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:13.870
Shine comforts from the east

1396
01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:16.770
that I may back to Athens bydaylight

1397
01:12:16.770 --> 01:12:21.400
from these that my poor companydetest.

1398
01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:24.930
And sleep, that sometimes shutsup sorrow's eye,

1399
01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:28.430
steal me awhile from mine owncompany.

1400
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:29.700
Yet but three?

1401
01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:30.900
Come one more.

1402
01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:33.270
Two of both kinds makes up four.

1403
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:35.930
Here she comes, curst and sad.

1404
01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:40.630
Cupid is a knavish lad thus tomake poor females mad.

1405
01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:43.670
Never so weary, never so in woe.

1406
01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:46.730
Bedabbled with the dew and tornwith briers,

1407
01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:50.100
I can no further crawl, nofurther go.

1408
01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:53.400
My legs can keep no pace with mydesires.

1409
01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.970
Here will I rest me till thebreak of day.

1410
01:12:56.970 --> 01:13:03.030
Heavens shield Lysander if theymean a fray.

1411
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:06.000
On the ground, sleep sound.

1412
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:14.700
I'll apply to your eye, gentlelover, remedy.

1413
01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:20.270
When thou wakest, thou takesttrue delight

1414
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:25.930
in the sight of thy formerlady's eye.

1415
01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:29.300
And the country proverb known

1416
01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:32.670
that every man should take hisown

1417
01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:38.030
in your waking shall be shown.

1418
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:40.800
Jack shall have Jill.

1419
01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.630
Nought shall go ill.

1420
01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:48.900
The man shall have his mareagain, and all shall be well.

1421
01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:51.300
Jack shall have Jill.

1422
01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:53.430
Nought shall go ill.

1423
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:56.670
The man shall have his mareagain,

1424
01:13:56.670 --> 01:14:00.170
and all shall be well.

1425
01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:03.200
Where's Peaseblossom?

1426
01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:04.300
Ready.

1427
01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:06.800
Scratch my head, Peaseblossom.

1428
01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:11.070
Come, sit thee down upon thisflowery bed

1429
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:14.230
while I thy amiable cheeks docoy

1430
01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:18.070
and stick musk-roses in thysleek, smooth head

1431
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:25.630
and kiss thy fair, large ears,my gentle joy.

1432
01:14:25.630 --> 01:14:28.000
Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?

1433
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.100
Ready.

1434
01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:31.500
Mounsieur Cobweb, goodmounsieur,

1435
01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.070
get you your weapons in yourhand

1436
01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:35.130
and kill me a red-hippedhumble-bee

1437
01:14:35.130 --> 01:14:36.830
on the top of a thistle.

1438
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:39.870
And, good mounsieur, bring methe honey-bag.

1439
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:43.230
Don't fret yourself too much inthe action, mounsieur.

1440
01:14:43.230 --> 01:14:47.300
And, good mounsieur, have a carethe honey-bag break not.

1441
01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:50.270
I would be loath to have youoverflown

1442
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:52.230
with a honey-bag, signior.

1443
01:14:52.230 --> 01:14:54.900
Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?

1444
01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:56.100
Ready.

1445
01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:58.170
Give me your neaf, MounsieurMustardseed.

1446
01:14:58.170 --> 01:15:00.700
Pray you, leave your courtesy,good mounsieur.

1447
01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.000
What's your Will?

1448
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.270
Nothing, good mounsieur, but tohelp Cavalery Cobweb to scratch.

1449
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:09.500
I must to the barber's,monsieur,

1450
01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:12.730
for methinks I am marvelloushairy about the face.

1451
01:15:12.730 --> 01:15:15.070
And I am such a tender ass,

1452
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:19.500
if my hair do but tickle me, Imust scratch.

1453
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:38.070
What, wilt thou hear some music,my sweet love?

1454
01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:43.170
I have a reasonable good ear inmusic.

1455
01:15:43.170 --> 01:15:44.830
Let's have the tongs and thebones.

1456
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:48.830
Or say, sweet love, what thoudesirest to eat.

1457
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:53.030
Truly, a peck of provender.

1458
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:54.900
I could munch your good dryoats.

1459
01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:58.170
Methinks I have a great desireto a bottle of hay.

1460
01:15:58.170 --> 01:16:01.600
Good hay, sweet hay, hath nofellow.

1461
01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:02.930
I have a venturous fairy

1462
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:05.770
that shall seek the squirrel'shoard and fetch thee new nuts.

1463
01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:10.530
I had rather have a handful ortwo of dried peas.

1464
01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:15.730
But let none of your people stirme.

1465
01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:18.530
I have an exposition of sleepcome upon me.

1466
01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:23.900
Sleep thou, and I will wind theein my arms.

1467
01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:29.300
Fairies, away, and be all waysaway.

1468
01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:40.530
So doth the woodbine the sweethoneysuckle gently entwist.

1469
01:16:40.530 --> 01:16:45.870
The female ivy so enrings thebarky fingers of the elm.

1470
01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:51.370
Oh, how I love thee.

1471
01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:55.270
Oh, how I dote on thee.

1472
01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:06.100
See'st thou this sweet sight?

1473
01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:08.500
Her dotage now I do begin topity.

1474
01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:11.470
For, meeting her of late behindthe wood

1475
01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:14.470
seeking sweet favours for thishateful fool,

1476
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:18.170
I did upbraid her and fall outwith her.

1477
01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:19.630
For she his hairy temples

1478
01:17:19.630 --> 01:17:24.000
then had rounded with a coronetof fresh and fragrant flowers.

1479
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.370
And that same dew, whichsometime on the buds

1480
01:17:27.370 --> 01:17:30.600
was wont to swell like round andorient pearls

1481
01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.070
stood now within the prettyflowerets' eyes

1482
01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:36.900
like tears that did their owndisgrace bewail.

1483
01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:40.130
When I had at my pleasuretaunted her

1484
01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:44.200
and she in mild terms begged mypatience,

1485
01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.600
I then did ask of her herchangeling child,

1486
01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:48.170
which straight she gave me.

1487
01:17:48.170 --> 01:17:52.130
And her fairy sent to bear himto my bower in fairy land.

1488
01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:55.370
And now I have the boy,

1489
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:59.070
I will undo this hatefulimperfection of her eyes.

1490
01:17:59.070 --> 01:18:03.070
And, gentle Puck, take thistransformed scalp

1491
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:05.100
from off the head of thisAthenian swain.

1492
01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:06.970
That, he awaking when the otherdo,

1493
01:18:06.970 --> 01:18:09.670
may all to Athens back againrepair

1494
01:18:09.670 --> 01:18:11.930
and think no more of thisnight's accidents

1495
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:18.030
but as the fierce vexation of adream.

1496
01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:24.730
But first, I will release thefairy queen.

1497
01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:31.900
Be as thou wast wont to be.

1498
01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:39.630
See as thou wast wont to see.

1499
01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:49.730
Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower

1500
01:18:49.730 --> 01:18:53.070
hath such force and blessedpower.

1501
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:56.800
Now, my Titania,

1502
01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:08.470
wake you, my sweet queen.

1503
01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:15.630
My Oberon.

1504
01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.930
What visions have I seen.

1505
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:35.600
Methought I was enamoured of anass.

1506
01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:45.800
There lies your love.

1507
01:19:54.170 --> 01:19:56.930
How came these things to pass?

1508
01:19:56.930 --> 01:20:00.100
Oh, how mine eyes do loathe hisvisage now.

1509
01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:01.430
Silence awhile.

1510
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:03.070
Robin, take off this head.

1511
01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:04.970
Titania, music call.

1512
01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:10.300
Music, music, such as charmethsleep.

1513
01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:17.600
Now, when thou wakest, withthine own fool's eyes peep.

1514
01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.230
Sound, music.

1515
01:20:20.230 --> 01:20:21.930
Come, my queen, take hands withme

1516
01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:27.530
and rock the ground whereonthese sleepers be.

1517
01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:30.770
Now thou and I are new in amity,

1518
01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:33.500
and will to-morrow midnightsolemnly dance

1519
01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.670
in Duke Theseus' housetriumphantly

1520
01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:39.730
and bless it to all fairprosperity.

1521
01:20:39.730 --> 01:20:42.630
There shall the pairs offaithful lovers be wedded

1522
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:46.070
with Theseus all in jollity.

1523
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:47.530
Fairy king, attend, and mark.

1524
01:20:47.530 --> 01:20:48.830
I do hear the morning lark.

1525
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:50.330
Then, my queen, in silence sad,

1526
01:20:50.330 --> 01:20:52.000
trip we after night's shade.

1527
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.870
We the globe can compass soonswifter than the wandering moon.

1528
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:56.570
Come, my lord, and in ourflight,

1529
01:20:56.570 --> 01:21:00.900
tell me how it came this nightthat I sleeping here was found

1530
01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:03.870
with these mortals on theground.

1531
01:21:12.730 --> 01:21:14.470
I was with Hercules and Cadmusonce,

1532
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:16.670
when in a wood of Crete,

1533
01:21:16.670 --> 01:21:19.230
they bayed the bear with houndsof Sparta.

1534
01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:22.030
Never did I hear such gallantchiding.

1535
01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:25.170
For besides the groves, theskies, the fountains,

1536
01:21:25.170 --> 01:21:29.370
every region near seemed all onemutual cry.

1537
01:21:29.370 --> 01:21:35.200
I never heard so musical adiscord, such sweet thunder.

1538
01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:37.100
Good morrow, friends.

1539
01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.400
Saint Valentine is passed.

1540
01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:42.200
Begin these wood-birds but tocouple now?

1541
01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.870
But speak, Egeus,

1542
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:45.030
is this not the day

1543
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:47.400
that Hermia should give answerof her choice.

1544
01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:48.830
It is, my Lord.

1545
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:50.830
I pray, all, stand up.

1546
01:21:55.170 --> 01:21:58.300
I know you two are rivalenemies.

1547
01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:01.870
How comes this gentle concord inthe world,

1548
01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:03.700
that hatred is so far fromjealousy

1549
01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:06.600
to sleep by hate and fear noenmity?

1550
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:11.830
My lord, I shall reply amazedly,half sleep, half waking,

1551
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:17.230
but as yet, I swear, I cannottruly say how I came here.

1552
01:22:17.230 --> 01:22:18.870
But, as I think--

1553
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:23.930
for truly would I speak, and nowdo I bethink me, so it is--

1554
01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:25.800
I came hither with Hermia.

1555
01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.570
Our intent was to be gone fromAthens,

1556
01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:30.130
where we might, without theperil of the Athenian law--

1557
01:22:30.130 --> 01:22:32.300
Enough, enough, my lord.

1558
01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:33.570
You have enough.

1559
01:22:33.570 --> 01:22:37.100
I beg the law, the law upon hishead.

1560
01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:39.570
They would have stolen away.

1561
01:22:39.570 --> 01:22:40.900
They would, Demetrius,

1562
01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:43.570
thereby to have defeated you andme,

1563
01:22:43.570 --> 01:22:46.800
you of your wife, and me of myconsent,

1564
01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:49.400
of my consent that she should beyour wife.

1565
01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:52.600
My lord, fair Helen told me oftheir stealth,

1566
01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:55.070
of this their purpose hither tothis wood.

1567
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:57.270
And I, in fury, hither followedthem,

1568
01:22:57.270 --> 01:23:00.300
fair Helena, in fancy, followingme.

1569
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:02.770
But, my good lord, I wot not bywhat power--

1570
01:23:02.770 --> 01:23:04.470
but by some power it is--

1571
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:06.670
my love to Hermia, melted as thesnow,

1572
01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:10.700
seems to me now as theremembrance of an idle gaud

1573
01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:12.530
which in my childhood I did doteupon.

1574
01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:15.500
All the faith, the virtue of myheart,

1575
01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:20.900
the object and the pleasure ofmine eye is only Helena.

1576
01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:23.970
To her, my lord, was I betrothedere I saw Hermia.

1577
01:23:23.970 --> 01:23:26.800
But, like in sickness, did Iloathe this food.

1578
01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.200
But, as in health, come to mynatural taste.

1579
01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:33.670
Now I do wish it, love it, longfor it,

1580
01:23:33.670 --> 01:23:37.730
and will, for evermore, be trueto it.

1581
01:23:37.730 --> 01:23:41.170
Egeus, I will overbear yourwill.

1582
01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:43.900
For in the temple by and by withus

1583
01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:47.200
these couples shall eternally beknit.

1584
01:23:56.570 --> 01:23:59.200
These things seem small andindistinguishable,

1585
01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:03.170
like far off mountains turnedinto clouds.

1586
01:24:03.170 --> 01:24:05.770
Methinks I see these things withparted eye

1587
01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:07.370
when everything seems double.

1588
01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:12.970
So methinks, and I have foundDemetrius like a jewel,

1589
01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:17.530
mine own, and not mine own.

1590
01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:20.070
Are you sure that we are awake?

1591
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:22.970
It seems to me that yet wesleep, we dream.

1592
01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:26.400
Do not you think The duke washere, and bid us follow him?

1593
01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.100
Yea, and my father.

1594
01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:29.230
And Hippolyta.

1595
01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:33.700
And he bid us follow to thetemple.

1596
01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:34.930
Why, then, we are awake.

1597
01:24:34.930 --> 01:24:39.700
Let's follow him and by the waylet us recount our dream.

1598
01:24:45.370 --> 01:24:48.170
When my cue comes, call me, andI will answer.

1599
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:54.400
My next is, "Most fair Pyramus."

1600
01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:58.830
Heigh-ho, Peter Quince.

1601
01:24:58.830 --> 01:25:00.500
Flute, the bellows-mender.

1602
01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:03.570
Snout, the tinker.

1603
01:25:05.130 --> 01:25:06.800
Starveling.

1604
01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:12.600
God's my life, stolen hence, andleft me asleep.

1605
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:21.070
I have had a most rare vision.

1606
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:27.830
I have had a dream, past the witof man to say what dream it was.

1607
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:31.770
Man is but an ass if he go aboutto expound this dream.

1608
01:25:31.770 --> 01:25:40.030
Methought I was-- there is noman can tell what.

1609
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:43.770
Methought I was-- and methoughtI had--

1610
01:25:47.970 --> 01:25:49.800
but man is but a patched fool,

1611
01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:53.800
if he will offer to say whatmethought I had.

1612
01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.600
The eye of man hath not heard.

1613
01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.100
The ear of man hath not seen.

1614
01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:00.670
Man's hand is not able to taste,his tongue to conceive,

1615
01:26:00.670 --> 01:26:08.330
nor his heart to report what mydream was.

1616
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:12.170
I will get Peter Quince to writea ballad of this dream.

1617
01:26:12.170 --> 01:26:18.300
It shall be called Bottom'sDream,

1618
01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:22.070
because it hath no bottom.

1619
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:24.970
And I will sing it in the latterend of a play

1620
01:26:24.970 --> 01:26:26.670
before the duke.

1621
01:26:26.670 --> 01:26:29.100
Peradventure, to make it themore gracious,

1622
01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:32.730
I shall sing it at her death.

1623
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:39.870
'Tis strange my Theseus, thatthese lovers speak of.

1624
01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:41.530
More strange than true.

1625
01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:46.100
I never may believe theseantique fables,

1626
01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:49.100
nor these fairy toys.

1627
01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:51.700
Lovers and madmen have suchseething brains,

1628
01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:53.600
such shaping fantasies

1629
01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:59.600
that apprehend more than coolreason ever comprehends.

1630
01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:02.670
The lunatic, the lover, and thepoet

1631
01:27:02.670 --> 01:27:04.870
are of imagination all compact.

1632
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:08.900
One sees more devils than vasthell can hold.

1633
01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:11.330
That is the madman.

1634
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:13.270
The lover, all as frantic,

1635
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:16.870
sees Helen's beauty in a brow ofEgypt.

1636
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:20.970
The poet's eye, in a fine frenzyrolling

1637
01:27:20.970 --> 01:27:24.500
doth glance from heaven toearth, from earth to heaven

1638
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:29.730
and as imagination bodies forththe forms of things unknown.

1639
01:27:29.730 --> 01:27:32.130
The poet's pen turns them toshapes

1640
01:27:32.130 --> 01:27:38.370
and gives to airy nothing alocal habitation and a name.

1641
01:27:38.370 --> 01:27:42.330
Such tricks hath strongimagination

1642
01:27:42.330 --> 01:27:45.570
that if it would but apprehendsome joy,

1643
01:27:45.570 --> 01:27:51.830
it comprehends some bringer ofthat joy.

1644
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:54.230
Or in the night, imagining somefear,

1645
01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:58.300
how easy is a bush supposed abear.

1646
01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:00.400
But all the story of the nighttold over,

1647
01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.900
and all their minds transfiguredso together,

1648
01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:08.070
more witnesseth than fancy'simages

1649
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:11.700
and grows to something of greatconstancy,

1650
01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:15.900
but, howsoever, strange andadmirable.

1651
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:21.900
Have you sent to Bottom's house?

1652
01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:23.570
Is he come home yet?

1653
01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:25.230
He cannot be heard of.

1654
01:28:25.230 --> 01:28:27.570
Out of doubt, he is transported.

1655
01:28:27.570 --> 01:28:30.300
If he come not, then the play ismarred.

1656
01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:31.800
It goes not forward, doth it?

1657
01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.800
It is not possible.

1658
01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:35.270
You have not a man in all Athens

1659
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:37.130
able to discharge Pyramus buthe.

1660
01:28:37.130 --> 01:28:41.670
No, he hath simply the best witof any handicraft man in Athens.

1661
01:28:41.670 --> 01:28:43.400
Yea.

1662
01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:46.600
And the best person too.

1663
01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:49.870
And he is a very paramour for asweet voice.

1664
01:28:49.870 --> 01:28:51.430
You must say "paragon."

1665
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:54.570
A paramour is, God bless us, athing of naught.

1666
01:28:54.570 --> 01:28:56.830
Masters, the duke is coming fromthe temple,

1667
01:28:56.830 --> 01:29:00.270
and there is two or three lordsand ladies more married.

1668
01:29:00.270 --> 01:29:04.870
If our sport had gone forward,we had all been made men.

1669
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:08.870
Oh, sweet bully Bottom.

1670
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:12.570
Thus hath he lost sixpence a dayduring his life.

1671
01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:14.870
He could not have 'scapedsixpence a day.

1672
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:17.230
An the duke had not given himsixpence a day

1673
01:29:17.230 --> 01:29:19.000
for playing Pyramus, I'll behanged.

1674
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.200
He would have deserved it.

1675
01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:26.000
Sixpence a day in Pyramus ornothing.

1676
01:29:27.730 --> 01:29:29.030
Where are these lads?

1677
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:32.230
Where are these hearts?

1678
01:29:32.230 --> 01:29:33.230
Bottom?

1679
01:29:33.570 --> 01:29:34.570
Bottom?

1680
01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:38.700
Bottom!

1681
01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:41.170
Oh, most courageous day.

1682
01:29:41.170 --> 01:29:42.600
Oh, most happy hour.

1683
01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.600
Masters, I am to discoursewonders,

1684
01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:47.330
but ask me not what, for if Itell you, I am no true Athenian.

1685
01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:49.730
I will tell you every thing,right as it fell out.

1686
01:29:49.730 --> 01:29:51.170
Let us hear, sweet Bottom.

1687
01:29:51.170 --> 01:29:52.430
Not a word of me.

1688
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:55.100
All that I will tell you is thatthe duke hath dined.

1689
01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:58.230
Get your apparel together, goodstrings to your beards,

1690
01:29:58.230 --> 01:29:59.600
new ribbons to your pumps.

1691
01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.330
Meet presently at the palace.

1692
01:30:01.330 --> 01:30:03.070
Every man look o'er his part.

1693
01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:05.700
For the short and the long is,

1694
01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:08.000
our play is preferred!

1695
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.730
In any case, let Thisbe haveclean linen,

1696
01:30:11.730 --> 01:30:15.300
and let not him that plays thelion pair his nails,

1697
01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:17.770
for they shall hang out for thelion's claws.

1698
01:30:17.770 --> 01:30:22.400
And, most dear actors, eat noonions nor garlic,

1699
01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.630
for we are to utter sweetbreath,

1700
01:30:24.630 --> 01:30:26.430
and I do not doubt but to hearthem say

1701
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:27.770
it is a sweet comedy.

1702
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:29.500
No more words: away!

1703
01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:30.530
Go, away.

1704
01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:42.700
Come now, what masques, whatdances shall we have

1705
01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:44.530
to wear away the long age ofthree hours

1706
01:30:44.530 --> 01:30:46.470
between our after-supper andbed-time?

1707
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:48.930
Where is our usual manager ofmirth?

1708
01:30:48.930 --> 01:30:51.930
What revels are in hand?

1709
01:30:51.930 --> 01:30:55.070
Is there no play to ease theanguish of a torturing hour?

1710
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:56.200
Call Philostrate.

1711
01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:57.600
Here, mighty Theseus.

1712
01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.930
Say, what abridgement have youfor this evening?

1713
01:30:59.930 --> 01:31:01.100
What masque?

1714
01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:02.470
What music?

1715
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:05.900
How shall we beguile the lazytime, if not with some delight?

1716
01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:08.430
There is a brief how many sportsare ripe.

1717
01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:11.270
Make choice of which yourhighness will see first.

1718
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:13.500
"The battle with the Centaurs

1719
01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:16.070
to be sung By an Athenian eunuchto the harp."

1720
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:17.470
We'll none of that.

1721
01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:21.630
That have I told my love inglory of my kinsman Hercules.

1722
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:24.430
"The riot of the tipsyBacchanals

1723
01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:26.700
tearing the Thracian singer intheir rage."

1724
01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:29.300
That is an old device, and itwas played

1725
01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:32.200
when I from Thebes came last aconqueror.

1726
01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:37.130
"The thrice three muses mourningfor the death of learning,

1727
01:31:37.130 --> 01:31:39.300
late deceased in beggary."

1728
01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:41.900
That is some satire, keen andcritical,

1729
01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:44.100
not sorting with a nuptialceremony.

1730
01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:49.700
"A tedious brief scene of youngPyramus and his love Thisbe,

1731
01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:51.930
very tragical mirth."

1732
01:31:51.930 --> 01:31:53.970
Merry and tragical.

1733
01:31:53.970 --> 01:31:55.100
Tedious and brief.

1734
01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:59.170
That is, hot ice and wondrousstrange snow.

1735
01:31:59.170 --> 01:32:02.270
How shall we find the concord ofthis discord?

1736
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:05.900
A play there is, my lord, someten words long,

1737
01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:07.900
which is as brief as I haveknown a play.

1738
01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.430
But by ten words, my lord, it istoo long,

1739
01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:11.900
which makes it tedious.

1740
01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:15.130
For in all the play, there isnot one word apt,

1741
01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:16.500
one player fitted.

1742
01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:19.270
And tragical, my noble lord, itis.

1743
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:21.130
For Pyramus therein doth killhimself.

1744
01:32:21.130 --> 01:32:22.900
Which, when I saw rehearsed,

1745
01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:25.100
I must confess made mine eyeswater,

1746
01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:29.230
but more merry tears the passionof loud laughter never shed.

1747
01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:31.500
What are they that do play it?

1748
01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:33.530
Hard-handed men that work inAthens here,

1749
01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:35.600
which never laboured in theirminds till now

1750
01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:38.070
and now have toiled theirunbreathed memories

1751
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:40.400
with this same play against yournuptial.

1752
01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.470
And we will hear it.

1753
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:43.630
No, my noble lord.

1754
01:32:43.630 --> 01:32:45.930
It is not for you.

1755
01:32:45.930 --> 01:32:49.600
I have heard it over, and it isnothing, nothing in the world.

1756
01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:53.400
Unless you can find sport intheir intents,

1757
01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.970
extremely stretched and connedwith cruel pain

1758
01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:57.570
to do you service.

1759
01:32:57.570 --> 01:33:02.330
I will hear that play, for neveranything can be amiss

1760
01:33:02.330 --> 01:33:05.070
when simpleness and duty tenderit.

1761
01:33:05.070 --> 01:33:06.670
Go, bring them in.

1762
01:33:06.670 --> 01:33:08.700
I love not to see wretchednesso'er charged

1763
01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:11.200
and duty in his serviceperishing.

1764
01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:14.400
Why, gentle sweet, you shall seeno such thing.

1765
01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:16.270
He says they can do nothing inthis kind.

1766
01:33:16.270 --> 01:33:19.370
The kinder we, to give themthanks for nothing.

1767
01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:21.770
Our sport shall be to take whatthey mistake.

1768
01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:23.600
And what poor duty cannot do,

1769
01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:26.330
noble respect takes it in might,not merit.

1770
01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:29.800
Where I have come, great clerkshave purposed

1771
01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:32.400
to greet me with premeditatedwelcomes

1772
01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.670
where I have seen them shiverand look pale,

1773
01:33:34.670 --> 01:33:36.530
make periods in the midst ofsentences,

1774
01:33:36.530 --> 01:33:38.870
throttle their practised accentsin their fears,

1775
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:40.900
and in conclusion, dumbly havebroke off,

1776
01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:42.300
not paying me a welcome.

1777
01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:47.870
Trust me, sweet, out of thissilence yet I picked a welcome.

1778
01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:50.330
And in the modesty of fearfulduty,

1779
01:33:50.330 --> 01:33:53.430
I read as much as in therattling tongue

1780
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:55.800
of saucy and audaciouseloquence.

1781
01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:58.930
Love, therefore, and tongue-tiedsimplicity

1782
01:33:58.930 --> 01:34:03.300
in least speak most to mycapacity.

1783
01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:05.700
So please your grace, thePrologue is addressed.

1784
01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:07.800
Let him approach.

1785
01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:18.070
If we offend, it is with ourgood will.

1786
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:20.800
That you should think we comenot to offend,

1787
01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:22.730
but with good will

1788
01:34:22.730 --> 01:34:25.100
to show our simple skill.

1789
01:34:28.370 --> 01:34:29.600
Th--

1790
01:34:32.370 --> 01:34:34.970
That is the true beginning ofour end.

1791
01:34:34.970 --> 01:34:37.400
Consider then we come but indespite.

1792
01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:40.470
We do not come as minding tocontent you.

1793
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:42.930
Our true intent is all for yourdelight.

1794
01:34:42.930 --> 01:34:46.400
We are not here that you shouldhere repent you,

1795
01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:49.500
The actors are at hand, and bytheir show,

1796
01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:52.830
you shall know all that you arelike to know.

1797
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:54.930
Gentles, perchance you wonder atthis show.

1798
01:34:54.930 --> 01:34:57.770
But wonder on, till truth makeall things plain.

1799
01:34:57.770 --> 01:35:01.330
This man is Pyramus, if youwould know.

1800
01:35:01.330 --> 01:35:04.970
This beauteous lady Thisbe iscertain.

1801
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:10.430
This man, with lime andrough-cast,

1802
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:12.500
doth present Wall,

1803
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.500
that vile wall which did theselovers sunder.

1804
01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:21.200
And through Wall's chink, poorsouls,

1805
01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:23.770
they are content to whisper.

1806
01:35:23.770 --> 01:35:26.900
At the which let no man wonder.

1807
01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:35.600
This man, with lantern, dog, andbush of thorn,

1808
01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:37.670
presenteth Moonshine;

1809
01:35:39.170 --> 01:35:40.930
For, if you will know, bymoonshine

1810
01:35:40.930 --> 01:35:44.470
did these lovers think no scornto meet at Ninus' tomb,

1811
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:47.930
there, there to woo.

1812
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:52.070
This grisly beast, which Lionhight by name,

1813
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:55.800
the trusty Thisbe, coming firstby night,

1814
01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:58.730
did scare away, or rather didaffright.

1815
01:35:58.730 --> 01:36:01.830
And, as she fled, her mantle shedid fall,

1816
01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:06.330
which Lion vile with bloodymouth did stain.

1817
01:36:06.330 --> 01:36:10.970
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youthand tall

1818
01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:15.230
and finds his trusty Thisbe'smantle slain.

1819
01:36:15.230 --> 01:36:18.870
Whereat, with blade, withbloody, blameful blade,

1820
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:23.670
he bravely broached his boiling,bloody breast.

1821
01:36:23.670 --> 01:36:26.400
And Thisbe, tarrying in mulberryshade,

1822
01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:32.330
his dagger drew and died.

1823
01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:36.100
For all the rest, let Lion,Moonshine, Wall,

1824
01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:38.470
and lovers twain at largediscourse

1825
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:41.400
while here they do remain.

1826
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:52.900
In this same interlude, it dothbefall that I,

1827
01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:55.270
one Snout by name, present awall.

1828
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:57.730
And such a wall, as I will haveyou think,

1829
01:36:57.730 --> 01:37:00.330
that had in it a crannied holeor chink

1830
01:37:00.330 --> 01:37:04.330
through which the lovers,Pyramus and Thisbe,

1831
01:37:04.330 --> 01:37:07.130
did whisper often very secretly.

1832
01:37:07.130 --> 01:37:09.430
This loam, this rough-cast andthis stone

1833
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:11.670
doth show that I am that samewall.

1834
01:37:11.670 --> 01:37:14.300
The truth is so, and this thecranny is,

1835
01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:16.600
right and sinister,

1836
01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:21.130
through which the fearful loversare to whisper.

1837
01:37:21.130 --> 01:37:23.170
Oh, grim-looked night.

1838
01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:25.300
Oh, night with hue so black.

1839
01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:28.170
Oh, night, which ever art whenday is not.

1840
01:37:28.170 --> 01:37:30.530
Oh, night, Oh, night.

1841
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:32.900
Alack, alack, alack,

1842
01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:36.570
I fear my Thisbe's promise isforgot.

1843
01:37:36.570 --> 01:37:40.600
And thou, oh, wall, oh sweet,oh, lovely wall

1844
01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:45.100
that standest between herfather's ground and mine.

1845
01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:49.400
Thou wall, oh, wall, oh, sweetand lovely wall,

1846
01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:54.030
show me thy chink, to blinkthrough with mine eyne.

1847
01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:57.400
Thanks, courteous wall.

1848
01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:00.400
Jove shield thee well for this.

1849
01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:03.200
But what see I?

1850
01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:05.330
No Thisbe do I see.

1851
01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:08.930
Oh, wicked wall, through whom Isee no bliss.

1852
01:38:08.930 --> 01:38:13.500
Cursed be thy stones for thusdeceiving me.

1853
01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:16.630
The wall, methinks, beingsensible, should curse again.

1854
01:38:16.630 --> 01:38:18.600
No, in truth, sir, he shouldnot.

1855
01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.570
"Deceiving me" is Thisbe's cue.

1856
01:38:20.570 --> 01:38:23.200
She is to enter now, and I am tospy her through the wall.

1857
01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:25.770
You shall see, it will fall patas I told you.

1858
01:38:28.530 --> 01:38:32.200
Oh, wall, full often hast thouheard my moans

1859
01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:34.670
for parting my fair Pyramus andme.

1860
01:38:34.670 --> 01:38:38.430
My cherry lips have often kissedthy stones,

1861
01:38:38.430 --> 01:38:41.700
thy stones with lime and hairknit up in thee.

1862
01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:42.900
I see a voice.

1863
01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:45.270
Now will I to the chink to spy.

1864
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:50.000
An I can hear my Thisbe's face.

1865
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.270
Thisbe.

1866
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:53.430
My love, thou art my love, Ithink.

1867
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:54.570
Think what thou wilt.

1868
01:38:54.570 --> 01:38:55.670
I am thy lover's grace.

1869
01:38:55.670 --> 01:38:58.870
And, like Limander, am I trustystill.

1870
01:38:58.870 --> 01:39:01.770
And I like Helen, till the Fatesme kill.

1871
01:39:01.770 --> 01:39:03.870
Not Shafalus to Procrus was sotrue.

1872
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:06.900
As Shafalus to Procrus, I toyou.

1873
01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:13.830
Oh, kiss me through the hole ofthis vile wall.

1874
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:17.930
I kiss the wall's hole, not yourlips at all.

1875
01:39:17.930 --> 01:39:21.200
Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meetme straightway?

1876
01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:24.970
'Tide life, 'tide death, I comewithout delay.

1877
01:39:26.770 --> 01:39:30.330
Thus have I, Wall, my partdischarged so.

1878
01:39:30.330 --> 01:39:35.870
And, being done, thus Wall awaydoth go.

1879
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:38.400
This is the silliest stuff thatever I heard.

1880
01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.800
The best in this kind are butshadows.

1881
01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:43.370
And the worst are no worse ifimagination amend them.

1882
01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:46.200
It must be your imaginationthen, and not theirs.

1883
01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:49.000
If we imagine no worse of themthan they of themselves,

1884
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.600
they may pass for excellent men.

1885
01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:54.330
Ladies, you whose gentle hearts

1886
01:39:54.330 --> 01:39:57.970
do fear the smallest monstrousmouse that creeps on floor

1887
01:39:57.970 --> 01:40:00.470
may now perchance both quake andtremble here

1888
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:03.800
when lion rough in wildest ragedoth roar.

1889
01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:05.570
Then know that I, one Snug thejoiner,

1890
01:40:05.570 --> 01:40:07.430
am a lion-fell, nor else nolion's dam;.

1891
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:10.400
For, if I should as Lion

1892
01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:13.130
come in strife into your place,

1893
01:40:13.130 --> 01:40:16.170
'twere pity on my life.

1894
01:40:16.170 --> 01:40:19.000
A very gentle beast of a goodconscience.

1895
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.400
Let us listen to the moon.

1896
01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:25.270
This lantern doth the hornedmoon,

1897
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:28.170
the horned moon present.

1898
01:40:28.170 --> 01:40:32.830
Myself the man in the moon doseem to be.

1899
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:35.000
This is the greatest error ofall the rest.

1900
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.830
The man should be put into thelantern.

1901
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:39.030
How is it else the man in themoon?

1902
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:41.000
He dare not come there for thecandle.

1903
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.730
For, you see, it is already insnuff.

1904
01:40:42.730 --> 01:40:44.670
I am aweary of this moon.

1905
01:40:44.670 --> 01:40:46.270
Would it would change.

1906
01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:48.700
It would appear, by his smalllight of discretion,

1907
01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:50.430
that he is in the wane.

1908
01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:52.770
But yet, in courtesy, in allreason,

1909
01:40:52.770 --> 01:40:54.730
we must stay the time.

1910
01:40:58.330 --> 01:41:01.230
Proceed, Moon.

1911
01:41:01.230 --> 01:41:03.430
All that I have to say

1912
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:05.400
is to tell you that the lanternis the moon;

1913
01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:06.670
I, the man in the moon;

1914
01:41:06.670 --> 01:41:08.430
this thorn-bush, my thorn-bush;

1915
01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:13.170
and this dog, my dog.

1916
01:41:13.170 --> 01:41:15.200
This is old Ninny's tomb.

1917
01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:18.130
Where is my love?

1918
01:41:18.130 --> 01:41:19.970
ARR!!

1919
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:30.770
Well roared, Lion.

1920
01:41:30.770 --> 01:41:32.270
Well run, Thisbe.

1921
01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:33.700
Well shone, Moon.

1922
01:41:34.670 --> 01:41:37.630
Well moused, Lion.

1923
01:41:37.630 --> 01:41:39.530
And then came Pyramus.

1924
01:41:39.530 --> 01:41:42.000
And so the lion vanished.

1925
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.530
Sweet moon, I thank thee for thysunny beams.

1926
01:41:46.530 --> 01:41:50.400
I thank thee, moon, for shiningnow so bright.

1927
01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.600
For by thy gracious, golden,glittering gleams,

1928
01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:58.200
I trust to take of truest Thisbesight.

1929
01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:01.970
But stay, O spite.

1930
01:42:01.970 --> 01:42:06.500
But mark, poor knight, whatdreadful dole is here.

1931
01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:08.370
Eyes, do you see?

1932
01:42:08.370 --> 01:42:09.530
How can it be?

1933
01:42:09.530 --> 01:42:11.530
Oh, dainty duck.

1934
01:42:11.530 --> 01:42:12.700
Oh, dear.

1935
01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:19.900
Thy mantle good, what, stainedwith blood!

1936
01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:23.030
Approach, ye Furies fell.

1937
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:25.100
Oh, Fates, come, come.

1938
01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:27.430
Cut thread and thrum.

1939
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:31.900
Quail, crush, conclude, andquell.

1940
01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:34.270
Beshrew my heart, but I pity theman.

1941
01:42:34.270 --> 01:42:37.330
Oh, wherefore, Nature, didstthou lion's frame?

1942
01:42:37.330 --> 01:42:42.130
Since lion vile hath heredeflowered my dear,

1943
01:42:42.130 --> 01:42:43.570
which is--

1944
01:42:43.570 --> 01:42:44.730
no, no--

1945
01:42:44.730 --> 01:42:47.270
which was the fairest dame

1946
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:51.030
that lived, that loved, thatliked,

1947
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:54.500
that looked with cheer.

1948
01:42:54.500 --> 01:43:00.400
Come, tears, confound.

1949
01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:07.100
Out, sword, and wound the pap ofPyramus.

1950
01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:12.970
Ay, that left pap, where heartdoth hop.

1951
01:43:12.970 --> 01:43:21.170
Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.

1952
01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:26.100
Now am I dead,

1953
01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:29.870
Now am I fled.

1954
01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:33.230
My soul is in the sky.

1955
01:43:33.230 --> 01:43:36.800
Tongue, lose thy light.

1956
01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:39.600
Moon, take thy flight.

1957
01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:49.230
Now die...die...

1958
01:43:49.230 --> 01:43:54.400
die..die...die...

1959
01:43:57.300 --> 01:44:00.170
die.

1960
01:44:00.170 --> 01:44:01.730
How chance Moonshine is gone

1961
01:44:01.730 --> 01:44:03.900
before Thisbe comes back andfinds her lover?

1962
01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:07.000
She will find him by starlight.

1963
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.230
Here she comes.

1964
01:44:08.230 --> 01:44:09.700
And her passion ends the play.

1965
01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:14.170
What, dead, my dove?

1966
01:44:14.170 --> 01:44:15.830
O Pyramus, arise!

1967
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:17.570
Speak, speak.

1968
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:21.730
Quite dumb.

1969
01:44:21.730 --> 01:44:25.170
Dead, dead.

1970
01:44:25.170 --> 01:44:29.170
A tomb must cover thy sweeteyes.

1971
01:44:29.170 --> 01:44:32.130
These lily lips, this cherrynose,

1972
01:44:32.130 --> 01:44:36.870
these yellow cowslip cheeks aregone, are gone.

1973
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:41.000
Oh, lovers, make moan.

1974
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.800
His eyes were green as leeks.

1975
01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:48.000
Oh, Sisters three, come, come tome.

1976
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:53.000
With hands as pale as milk, laythem in gore

1977
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.870
since you have shore with shearshis thread of silk.

1978
01:44:57.870 --> 01:45:00.370
Tongue, not a word.

1979
01:45:03.170 --> 01:45:05.300
Come, trusty sword.

1980
01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:12.400
Come, blade, my breast imbrue.

1981
01:45:16.030 --> 01:45:18.970
And, farewell, friends.

1982
01:45:18.970 --> 01:45:21.530
Thus Thisbe ends.

1983
01:45:26.130 --> 01:45:31.970
Adieu, adieu, adieu.

1984
01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:37.270
Moonshine and Lion are left tobury the dead.

1985
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:39.200
Ay, and Wall too.

1986
01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:41.430
No, I assure you;

1987
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:43.770
the wall is down that partedtheir fathers.

1988
01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:46.070
Will it please you to see theepilogue

1989
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:49.030
or to hear a Bergomask dancebetween our company?

1990
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:50.700
Uh, no epilogue, I pray you,

1991
01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:52.700
for your play needs no excuse.

1992
01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:54.070
Never excuse,

1993
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:57.370
for when all the players aredead, there need none to beblamed.

1994
01:45:57.370 --> 01:45:59.500
But come, your Bergomask.

1995
01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:00.870
Let your epilogue alone.

1996
01:46:33.730 --> 01:46:36.930
The iron tongue of midnight hathtold twelve.

1997
01:46:36.930 --> 01:46:39.230
Lovers, to bed.

1998
01:46:39.230 --> 01:46:42.830
'Tis almost fairy time.

1999
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:46.970
I fear we shall out-sleep thecoming morn

2000
01:46:46.970 --> 01:46:49.030
as much as we this night haveover-watched.

2001
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:51.000
This palpable-gross play

2002
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.930
hath well beguiled the heavygait of night.

2003
01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:57.700
Sweet friends, to bed.

2004
01:46:57.700 --> 01:47:02.100
Now the hungry lion roars, andthe wolf behowls the moon

2005
01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:04.370
whilst the heavy ploughmansnores,

2006
01:47:04.370 --> 01:47:06.600
all with weary task fordone.

2007
01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:08.900
Now the wasted brands do glow,

2008
01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:11.900
whilst the screech-owl,screeching loud,

2009
01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:15.530
puts the wretch that lies in woein remembrance of a shroud.

2010
01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:19.600
Now it is the time of night thatthe graves all gaping wide,

2011
01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:22.100
every one lets forth his sprite,

2012
01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:24.000
in the church-way paths toglide.

2013
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.670
And we fairies, that do run bythe triple Hecate's team

2014
01:47:27.670 --> 01:47:31.330
from the presence of the sunfollowing darkness like a dream

2015
01:47:31.330 --> 01:47:32.470
now are frolic.

2016
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:35.470
Not a mouse shall disturb thishallowed house.

2017
01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:37.500
I am sent with broom before

2018
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.630
to sweep the dust behind thedoor.

2019
01:47:39.630 --> 01:47:41.600
Through the house, givegathering light.

2020
01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:43.270
By the dead and drowsy fire,

2021
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:46.570
every elf and fairy sprite hopas light as bird from brier.

2022
01:47:46.570 --> 01:47:49.430
And this ditty, after me, singand dance it trippingly.

2023
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:51.100
First, rehearse your song byrote

2024
01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:52.530
to each word a warbling note.

2025
01:47:52.530 --> 01:47:57.230
Hand in hand, with fairy grace,will we sing and bless thisplace.

2026
01:47:57.230 --> 01:48:01.070
Now, until the break of day,through this house each fairystray.

2027
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:03.470
To the best bride-bed will we,

2028
01:48:03.470 --> 01:48:05.400
which by us shall blessed be.

2029
01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:09.400
And the issue there create evershall be fortunate.

2030
01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:14.330
So shall all the couples threeever true in loving be.

2031
01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:17.870
And the blots of Nature's handshall not in their issue stand.

2032
01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:22.230
Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,nor mark prodigious,

2033
01:48:22.230 --> 01:48:24.030
such as are despised innativity,

2034
01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:26.100
shall upon their children be.

2035
01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:32.770
With this field-dew consecrate,every fairy take his gait.

2036
01:48:32.770 --> 01:48:35.600
And each several chamber bless,through this palace,

2037
01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:36.970
with sweet peace.

2038
01:48:36.970 --> 01:48:42.930
And the owner of it blessed evershall in safety rest.

2039
01:48:42.930 --> 01:48:44.330
Trip away.

2040
01:48:44.330 --> 01:48:45.600
Make no stay.

2041
01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:47.400
Meet me all by break of day.

2042
01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:24.830
If we shadows have offended,

2043
01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:27.230
think but this, and all ismended,

2044
01:49:27.230 --> 01:49:31.230
that you have but slumbered herewhile these visions did appear.

2045
01:49:31.230 --> 01:49:35.100
And this weak and idle themenomore yielding but a dream.

2046
01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:36.800
Gentles, do not reprehend.

2047
01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:38.900
If you pardon, we will mend.

2048
01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:43.200
And, as I am an honest Puck, ifwe have unearned luck

2049
01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:45.130
now to escape the serpent'stongue,

2050
01:49:45.130 --> 01:49:49.000
we will make amends ere long,else the Puck a liar call.

2051
01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.930
So, good night unto you all.

2052
01:51:48.970 --> 01:51:51.970
