IN THUNDER, LIGHTNING, OR IN RAIN?

WHEN THE HURLY-BURLY'S DONE,

8
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.800

28
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.800
DOUBTFUL IT STOOD,

29
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.600
AS TWO SPENT SWIMMERS THAT DO CLING TOGETHER

30
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.270
AND CHOKE THEIR ART.

31
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.730
A MERCILESS MACDONWALD-- WORTHY TO BE A REBEL,

32
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.670
FOR TO THAT THE MULTIPLYING VILLAINIES OF NATURE

33
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.200

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.230
BUT ALL'S TOO WEAK.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.900
TILL HE FACED THE SLAVE,

44
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.730
WHICH NE'ER SHOOK HANDS NOR BADE FAREWELL TO HIM

45
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.530
TILL HE UNSEAMED HIM FROM THE NAVE TO THE CHAPS!

47
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.600
AND FIXED HIS HEAD UPON OUR BATTLEMENTS.

48
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.470
OH, VALIANT COUSIN! WORTHY GENTLEMAN!

49
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.100
AS WHENCE THE SUN 'GINS HIS REFLECTION

50
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.270
SHIPWRECKING STORMS AND DIREFUL THUNDERS BREAK,

51
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:58.230
SO FROM THAT SPRING WHENCE COMFORT SEEMED TO COME

52
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.700
DISCOMFORT SWELLS.

53
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.800
MARK, KING OF SCOTLAND, MARK.

54
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.870
NO SOONER JUSTICE HAD, WITH VALOR ARMED,

55
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.270
COMPELLED THESE SKIPPING KERNS TO TRUST THEIR HEELS,

56
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.370
THAN THE NORWEYAN LORD, SURVEYING VANTAGE,

57
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.500
WITH FURBISHED ARMS AND NEW SUPPLIES OF MEN,

58
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.770
BEGAN A FRESH ASSAULT.

59
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.400
DISMAYED NOT THIS OUR CAPTAINS, MACBETH AND BANQUO?

60
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:27.870
YES, AS SPARROWS EAGLES OR THE HARE THE LION.

61
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.600
IF I SAY SOOTH, I MUST REPORT THEY WERE AS CANNONS

62
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.730
OVERCHARGED WITH DOUBLE CRACKS,

63
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.770
SO THEY DOUBLY REDOUBLED STROKES UPON THE FOE.

64
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.270
EXCEPT THEY MEANT TO BATHE IN REEKING WOUNDS

65
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.670
OR MEMORIZE ANOTHER GOLGOTHA, I CANNOT TELL!

66

[moans]

67
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.200
I AM FAINT.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.470
WHO COMES HERE?

72
00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.800
THE WORTHY THANE OF ROSS.

73
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.500
WHAT A HASTE LOOKS THROUGH HIS EYES.

74
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.300
SO SHOULD HE SPEAK THINGS STRANGE.

75
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.470
GOD SAVE THE KING.

76
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.100
WHENCE CAMEST THOU?

77
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.730
FROM FIFE, GREAT KING,

78
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.770
WHERE THE NORWEYAN BANNERS FLOUT THE SKY

79
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.470
AND FAN OUR PEOPLE COLD.

80
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.800
NORWAY HIMSELF, WITH TERRIBLE NUMBERS,

81
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.000
ASSISTED BY THAT MOST DISLOYAL TRAITOR,

82
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.500
THE THANE OF CAWDOR,

83
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.930
BEGAN A DISMAL CONFLICT,

84
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.770
TILL THAT BELLONA'S BRIDEGROOM, LAPPED IN PROOF,

85
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.530
CONFRONTED HIM WITH SELF-COMPARISONS,

86
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.870
POINT AGAINST POINT REBELLIOUS,

87
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.400
ARM 'GAINST ARM,

88
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.070
CURBING HIS LAVISH SPIRIT.

89
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.700
AND, TO CONCLUDE, THE VICTORY FELL ON US.

90
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.930
GREAT HAPPINESS!

91
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.570

CRAVES COMPOSITION.

93
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.630
NOR WOULD WE DEIGN HIM BURIAL OF HIS MEN

94
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.570
TILL HE DISBURSED, AT SAINT COLME'S INCH,

95
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.830
$10,000 TO OUR GENERAL USE.

96
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.900
NO MORE THAT THANE OF CAWDOR

97
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.170
SHALL DECEIVE OUR BOSOM INTEREST.

98
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.970
GO.  PRONOUNCE HIS PRESENT DEATH,

99
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.270
AND WITH HIS FORMER TITLE GREET MACBETH.

100
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.470
I'LL SEE IT DONE.

101
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.570
WHAT HE HATH LOST, NOBLE MACBETH HATH WON.

102
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.600
WHERE HAST THOU BEEN, SISTER?

103
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.170

104
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.300
SISTER, WHERE THOU?

105
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.970
A SAILOR'S WIFE HAD CHESTNUTS IN HER LAP,

106
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.430
AND MOUNCHED, AND MOUNCHED, AND MOUNCHED.

107
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.130
"GIVE ME," QUOTH I.

108
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.200

BUT IN A SIEVE I'LL THITHER SAIL

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.130
AND, LIKE A RAT WITHOUT A TAIL,

112
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.770
I'LL DO, I'LL DO, AND I'LL DO.

113
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:43.870

I MYSELF HAVE ALL THE OTHER,

117
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.030
AND THE VERY PORTS THEY BLOW,

118
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.700
ALL THE QUARTERS THAT THEY KNOW I' THE SHIPMAN'S CARD.

119
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.930
I'LL DRAIN HIM DRY AS HAY.

120
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.670
SLEEP SHALL NEITHER NIGHT NOR DAY

121
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.730
HANG UPON HIS PENTHOUSE LID.

122
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.230
HE SHALL LIVE A MAN FORBID.

123
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:14.870
WEARY SEV'NNIGHTS NINE TIMES NINE

124
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.300
SHALL HE DWINDLE, PEAK, AND PINE.

125
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.870
THOUGH HIS BARK CANNOT BE LOST, YET IT SHALL BE TEMPEST-TOST.

126
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.300

132
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.230
A DRUM, A DRUM.

133
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.030
MACBETH DOTH COME.

PEACE. THE CHARM'S WOUND UP.

141
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:12.770
SO FOUL AND FAIR A DAY I HAVE NOT SEEN.

142
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.700
HOW FAR IS 'T CALLED TO FORRES?

WHAT ARE THESE...

145
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.730
SO WITHERED AND SO WILD IN THEIR ATTIRE,

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.930

LESSER THAN MACBETH, AND GREATER.

179
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.700
NOT SO HAPPY,  YET MUCH HAPPIER.

180
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.600
THOU SHALT GET KINGS,  THOUGH THOU BE NONE.

181
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.300
SO ALL HAIL,  MACBETH AND BANQUO.

182
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.100
BANQUO AND MACBETH, ALL HAIL.

183
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.370
STAY!

184
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.970
YOU IMPERFECT SPEAKERS, TELL ME MORE.

185
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.000
BY SINEL'S DEATH I KNOW I AM THANE OF GLAMIS, BUT HOW OF CAWDOR?

186
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.470
THE THANE OF CAWDOR LIVES, A PROSPEROUS GENTLEMAN,

187
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.200
AND TO BE KING STANDS NOT WITHIN THE PROSPECT OF BELIEF,

188
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.570
NO MORE THAN TO BE CAWDOR.

189
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.700
SAY FROM WHENCE YOU OWE THIS STRANGE INTELLIGENCE.

190
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.730
OR WHY UPON THIS BLASTED HEATH YOU STOP OUR WAY

191
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.130
WITH SUCH PROPHETIC GREETING.

192
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.870
SPEAK!  SPEAK! I CHARGE YOU!

193
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.870
[thunder rumbling]

194
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:45.400
THE EARTH HATH BUBBLES AS THE WATER HAS,

195
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.670
AND THESE ARE OF THEM.

196
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.970
WITHER ARE THEY VANISHED?

197
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.970
INTO THE AIR.

198
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.730
AND WHAT SEEMED CORPORAL

199
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.700
MELTED AS BREATH INTO THE WIND.

200
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.830
WOULD THEY HAD STAYED.

201
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.870
WERE SUCH THINGS HERE AS WE DO SPEAK ABOUT?

202
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.530
OR HAVE WE EATEN ON THE INSANE ROOT

203
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.170
THAT TAKES THE REASON PRISONER?

204
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.770
YOUR CHILDREN SHALL BE KINGS.

205
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:13.970
[both laugh]

206
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.100
YOU SHALL BE KING!

207
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.670
AND THANE OF CAWDOR TOO. WENT IT NOT SO?

208
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.700
TO THE SELFSAME TUNE AND WORDS.

209
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:20.700
[metal clanks]

210
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.730
WHAT'S THAT?

211
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.530
THE KING HATH HAPPILY RECEIVED, MACBETH,

212
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:28.970
THE NEWS OF THY SUCCESS.

213
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:30.900
AND WHEN HE READS THY PERSONAL VENTURE

214
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.170
IN THE REBELS' FIGHT,

215
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.300
HIS WONDERS AND HIS PRAISES DO CONTEND

216
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.830
WHICH SHOULD BE THINE  OR HIS.

217
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.330
SILENCED WITH THAT,

218
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.730
IN VIEWING O'ER THE REST  O' THE SELFSAME DAY,

219
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.170
HE FINDS THEE IN THE STOUT NORWEYAN RANKS,

220
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.100
NOTHING AFEARD OF WHAT THYSELF DIDST MAKE,

221
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.370
STRANGE IMAGES OF DEATH.

222
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.670
AS THICK AS HAIL  CAME POST WITH POST,

223
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.400
AND EVERY ONE DID BEAR THY PRAISES

224
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.630
IN HIS KINGDOM'S GREAT DEFENSE,

225
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.600
AND POURED THEM DOWN BEFORE HIM.

226
00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.400
WE ARE SENT TO GIVE THEE, FROM OUR ROYAL MASTER, THANKS,

227
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.700
ONLY TO HERALD THEE INTO HIS SIGHT,

228
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.400
NOT PAY THEE.

229
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.270
AND FOR AN EARNEST OF A GREATER HONOR,

230
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.870
HE BADE ME, FROM HIM, CALL THEE THANE OF CAWDOR.

231
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.230
IN WHICH ADDITION,

232
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.000
HAIL, MOST WORTHY THANE,  FOR IT IS THINE.

233
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.200
WHAT, CAN THE DEVIL SPEAK TRUE?

234
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.130
THE THANE OF CAWDOR LIVES.

235
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.100
WHY DO YOU DRESS ME IN BORROWED ROBES?

236
00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.770
WHO WAS THE THANE LIVES YET,

237
00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.900
BUT UNDER HEAVY JUDGMENT BEARS THAT LIFE

238
00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.700
WHICH HE DESERVES TO LOSE.

239
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.930
WHETHER HE WAS COMBINED WITH THOSE OF NORWAY,

240
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.530
OR DID LINE THE REBEL WITH HIDDEN HELP AND VANTAGE,

241
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.700
OR THAT WITH BOTH

242
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.500
HE LABORED IN  HIS COUNTRY'S WRECK,

243
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.900
I KNOW NOT.

244
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.870
BUT TREASONS CAPITAL,  CONFESSED AND PROVED,

245
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.500
HAVE OVERTHROWN HIM.

246
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.170
[thinking] GLAMIS, AND THANE OF CAWDOR.

247
00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.930
THE GREATEST IS BEHIND.

248
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.430
THANKS FOR YOUR PAINS.

249
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.130
DO YOU NOT HOPE YOUR CHILDREN SHALL BE KINGS,

250
00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.300
WHEN THOSE THAT GAVE THE THANE OF CAWDOR TO ME

251
00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.970
PROMISED NO LESS TO THEM?

252
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.100
THAT, TRUSTED HOME,

253
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.030
MIGHT YET ENKINDLE YOU UNTO THE CROWN,

254
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.100
BESIDES THE THANE OF CAWDOR.

255
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.030
BUT 'TIS STRANGE.

256
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.470
AND OFTENTIMES, TO WIN US TO OUR HARM,

257
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.830
THE INSTRUMENTS OF DARKNESS TELL US TRUTHS,

258
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.100
WIN US WITH HONEST TRIFLES,

259
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.700
TO BETRAY US IN DEEPEST CONSEQUENCE.

260
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.900
COUSINS, A WORD, I PRAY.

261
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.170
TWO TRUTHS ARE TOLD

262
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.000
AS HAPPY PROLOGUES TO THE SWELLING

263
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.800
OF THE IMPERIAL THEME.

264
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:37.370
THIS SUPERNATURAL SOLICITING CANNOT BE ILL...

265
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:41.000
CANNOT BE GOOD.

266
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.270
IF ILL, WHY HATH IT GIVEN ME EARNEST OF SUCCESS,

267
00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.000
COMMENCING IN A TRUTH?

268
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.300
I AM THANE OF CAWDOR.

269
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:56.500
IF GOOD, WHY DO I YIELD TO THAT SUGGESTION

270
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.170
WHOSE HORRID IMAGE DOTH UNFIX MY HAIR

271
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.400
AND MAKE MY SEATED HEART KNOCK AT MY RIBS

272
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.730
AGAINST THE USE OF NATURE?

273
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:07.130
PRESENT FEARS ARE LESS THAN HORRIBLE IMAGININGS.

274
00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.700
MY THOUGHT, WHOSE MURDER YET IS BUT FANTASTICAL,

275
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.330
SHAKES SO MY SINGLE STATE OF MAN

276
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.270
THAT FUNCTION IS SMOTHERED IN SURMISE,

277
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.200
AND NOTHING IS BUT WHAT IS NOT.

278
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.030
LOOK, HOW OUR PARTNER'S RAPT.

279
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.500
IF CHANCE WILL HAVE ME KING,

280
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.700
WHY, CHANCE MAY CROWN ME,

281
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.070
WITHOUT MY STIR.

282
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.830
NEW HONORS COME UPON HIM, LIKE OUR STRANGE GARMENTS,

283
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:37.170
CLEAVE NOT TO THEIR MOLD BUT WITH THE AID OF USE.

284
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.570
COME WHAT COME MAY,

285
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.370
TIME AND THE HOUR RUNS THROUGH THE ROUGHEST DAY.

286
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.700
WORTHY MACBETH, WE STAY UPON YOUR LEISURE.

287
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.300
GIVE ME YOUR FAVOR.

288
00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.500
MY DULL BRAIN WAS WROUGHT WITH THINGS FORGOTTEN.

289
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.430
KIND GENTLEMEN, YOUR PAINS ARE REGISTERED

290
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.370
WHERE EVERY DAY I TURN TO LEAF TO READ THEM.

291
00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.930
LET US TOWARD THE KING.

292
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:01.700
THINK UPON WHAT HATH CHANCED,

293
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.400
AND AT MORE TIME, THE INTERIM HAVING WEIGHED IT,

294
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.530
LET US SPEAK OUR FREE HEARTS EACH TO OTHER.

295
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:08.530
VERY GLADLY.

296
00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:09.530
TILL THEN, ENOUGH.

297
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:10.570
COME, FRIENDS!

298
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:13.130
IS EXECUTION DONE ON CAWDOR?

299
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.500
ARE NOT THOSE IN COMMISSION YET RETURNED?

300
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.900
(Malcolm) MY LIEGE, THEY ARE NOT YET COME BACK.

301
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.830
BUT I HAVE SPOKE WITH ONE THAT SAW HIM DIE,

302
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.330
WHO DID REPORT THAT VERY FRANKLY HE CONFESSED HIS TREASONS,

303
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.500
IMPLORED YOUR HIGHNESS' PARDON,

304
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.170
AND SET FORTH A DEEP REPENTANCE.

305
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.830
NOTHING IN HIS LIFE BECAME HIM LIKE THE LEAVING IT.

306
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:35.770
HE DIED AS ONE THAT HAD BEEN STUDIED IN HIS DEATH

307
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.970
TO THROW AWAY THE DEAREST THING HE OW'D

308
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.830
AS 'TWERE A CARELESS TRIFLE.

309
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:45.170
THERE IS NO ART TO FIND THE MIND'S CONSTRUCTION

310
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.800
IN THE FACE.

311
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.870
HE WAS A GENTLEMAN ON WHOM I BUILT AN ABSOLUTE TRUST.

312
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.700
O WORTHIEST COUSIN!

313
00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.330
THE SIN OF MY INGRATITUDE EVEN NOW WAS HEAVY ON ME.

314
00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.370
THOU ART SO FAR BEFORE THAT SWIFTEST WING OF RECOMPENSE

315
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.830
IS SLOW TO OVERTAKE THEE.

316
00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.600
WOULD THOU HADST LESS DESERVED,

317
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.130
THAT THE PROPORTION BOTH OF THANKS AND PAYMENT

318
00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.230
MIGHT HAVE BEEN MINE.

319
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:13.870
ONLY I HAVE LEFT TO SAY,

320
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:18.700
MORE IS THY DUE THAN MORE THAN ALL CAN PAY.

321
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.670
THE SERVICE AND THE LOYALTY I OWE,

322
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.330
IN DOING IT, PAYS ITSELF.

323
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.530
YOUR HIGHNESS' PART IS TO RECEIVE OUR DUTIES,

324
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.930
AND OUR DUTIES ARE TO YOUR THRONE AND STATE,

325
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.500
CHILDREN AND SERVANTS,

326
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.070
WHICH DO BUT WHAT THEY SHOULD,

327
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.000
BY DOING EVERYTHING SAFE TOWARD YOUR LOVE AND HONOR.

328
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.030
WELCOME HITHER.

329
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:38.830
I HAVE BEGUN TO PLANT THEE,

330
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:42.230
AND WILL LABOR TO MAKE THEE FULL OF GROWING.

331
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:46.470
NOBLE BANQUO, THAT HAST NO LESS DESERVED,

332
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.970
NOR MUST BE KNOWN NO LESS TO HAVE DONE SO,

333
00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.870
LET ME INFOLD THEE AND HOLD THEE TO MY HEART.

334
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.300
THERE IF I GROW, THE HARVEST IS YOUR OWN.

335
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.970
MY PLENTEOUS JOYS, WANTON IN FULLNESS,

336
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:06.200
SEEK TO HIDE THEMSELVES IN DROPS OF SORROW.

337
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.700
SONS, KINSMEN THANES,

338
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.170
AND YOU WHOSE PLACES ARE THE NEAREST, KNOW,

339
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.130
WE WILL ESTABLISH OUR ESTATE UPON OUR ELDEST, MALCOLM,

340
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:22.270
WHOM WE NAME HEREAFTER  THE PRINCE OF CUMBERLAND.

341
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:26.670
WHICH HONOR MUST NOT  UNACCOMPANIED INVEST HIM ONLY,

342
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:30.570
BUT SIGNS OF NOBLENESS,  LIKE STARS,

343
00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.830
SHALL SHINE ON ALL DESERVERS.

344
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:37.200
FROM HENCE TO INVERNESS,

345
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.570
AND BIND US FURTHER TO YOU.

346
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:39.930
I'LL BE MYSELF THE HARBINGER,

347
00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.870
AND MAKE JOYFUL THE HEARING OF MY WIFE

348
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.000
WITH YOUR APPROACH,

349
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.200
SO HUMBLY TAKE MY LEAVE.

350
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.030
MY WORTHY CAWDOR.

351
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.830
THE PRINCE OF CUMBERLAND.

352
00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:01.430
THAT IS A STEP ON WHICH I MUST FALL DOWN

WE WILL SPEAK FURTHER.

459
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:13.600
ONLY LOOK UP CLEAR.

460
00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.430

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.900
STRIDING THE BLAST,

529
00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.470
OR HEAVEN'S CHERUBIN,

530
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:36.800
HORSED UPON THE SIGHTLESS COURIERS OF THE AIR,

531
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.230
SHALL BLOW THE HORRID DEED IN EVERY EYE,

532
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:44.470
THAT TEARS SHALL DROWN THE WIND.

533
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:46.770
[sighs]

534
00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:52.930
I HAVE NO SPUR TO PRICK THE SIDES OF MY INTENT,

535
00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:56.130
ONLY VAULTING AMBITION, WHICH O'ERLEAPS ITSELF

536
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:57.530
AND FALLS ON THE OTHER--

537
00:29:58.770 --> 00:29:59.930
HOW NOW?  WHAT NEWS?

538
00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:01.070
HE HAS ALMOST SUPPED.

539
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:02.500
WHY HAVE YOU LEFT THE CHAMBER?

540
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.430
HATH HE ASKED FOR ME?

541
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.430
KNOW YOU NOT HE HAS?

542
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:07.370
WE WILL PROCEED NO FURTHER IN THIS BUSINESS.

543
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.100
HE HATH HONORED ME OF LATE,

544
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.070
AND I HAVE BOUGHT GOLDEN OPINIONS

545
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:12.570
FROM ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE,

546
00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.770
WHICH WOULD BE WORN NOW IN THEIR NEWEST GLOSS,

547
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:16.500
NOT CAST ASIDE SO SOON.

548
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:20.400
WAS THE HOPE DRUNK WHEREIN YOU DRESSED YOURSELF?

549
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.500
HATH IT SLEPT SINCE?

550
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.800
AND WAKES IT NOW,

551
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:27.270
TO LOOK SO GREEN AND PALE AT WHAT IT DID SO FREELY?

552
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:31.030
FROM THIS TIME SUCH I ACCOUNT THY LOVE.

553
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.100
ART THOU AFEARED

554
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.800
TO BE THE SAME IN THINE OWN ACT AND VALOR

555
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.170
AS THOU ART IN DESIRE?

556
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:42.770
WOULDST THOU HAVE THAT WHICH THOU ESTEEM'ST

557
00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.230
THE ORNAMENT OF LIFE

558
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:46.170
AND LIVE A COWARD IN THINE OWN ESTEEM,

559
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:48.100
LETTING "I DARE NOT" WAIT UPON "I WOULD,"

560
00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.570
LIKE THE POOR CAT I' THE ADAGE?

561
00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:51.300
PEACE!

562
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.930
I DARE DO ALL THAT MAY BECOME A MAN.

563
00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:54.300
WHO DARES DO MORE IS NONE.

564
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.830
WHAT BEAST WAS 'T THEN

565
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.830
THAT MADE YOU BREAK THIS ENTERPRISE TO ME?

566
00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:01.130
WHEN YOU DURST DO IT, THEN YOU WERE A MAN,

567
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:03.200
AND TO BE MORE THAN WHAT YOU WERE,

568
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.200
YOU WOULD BE SO MUCH MORE THE MAN.

569
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:10.200
NOR TIME NOR PLACE DID THEN ADHERE,

570
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.970
YET YOU WOULD MAKE BOTH.

571
00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.600
THEY HAVE MADE THEMSELVES,

572
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.370
AND THAT, THEIR FITNESS, NOW DOES UNMAKE YOU.

573
00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:26.830
I HAVE GIVEN SUCK, AND KNOW HOW TENDER 'TIS

574
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:29.730
TO LOVE THE BABE THAT MILKS ME.

575
00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:33.570
I WOULD, WHILE IT WAS SMILING IN MY FACE,

576
00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.700
HAVE PLUCKED MY NIPPLE FROM HIS BONELESS GUMS

577
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.530
AND DASHED THE BRAINS OUT,

578
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:43.530
HAD I SO SWORN AS YOU HAVE DONE TO THIS.

579
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:52.200
IF WE SHOULD FAIL?

580
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.230
WE FAIL.

581
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:59.630
BUT SCREW YOUR COURAGE TO THE STICKING-PLACE

582
00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:02.300
AND WE'LL NOT FAIL.

583
00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:05.100
WHEN DUNCAN IS ASLEEP--

584
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.300
WHERETO THE RATHER SHALL HIS DAY'S HARD JOURNEY

585
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.700
SOUNDLY INVITE HIM--

586
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.430
HIS TWO CHAMBERLAINS WILL I WITH WINE AND WASSAIL

587
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:13.600
SO CONVINCE

588
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.270
THAT MEMORY, THE WARDER OF THE BRAIN,

589
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:16.570
SHALL BE A FUME,

590
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:19.700
AND THE RECEIPT OF REASON A LIMBEC ONLY.

591
00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:23.070
WHEN IN SWINISH SLEEP THEIR DRENCHED NATURES LIE

592
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.470
AS IN A DEATH,

593
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:29.170
WHAT CANNOT YOU AND I PERFORM UPON THE UNGUARDED DUNCAN?

594
00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:31.630
WHAT NOT PUT UPON HIS SPONGY OFFICERS,

595
00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:35.870
WHO SHALL BEAR THE GUILT OF OUR GREAT QUELL?

596
00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.500
BRING FORTH MEN-CHILDREN ONLY,

597
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.600
FOR THINE UNDAUNTED METTLE

598
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.230
SHOULD COMPOSE NOTHING BUT MALES.

599
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:48.200
WILL IT NOT BE RECEIVED,

600
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.570
WHEN WE HAVE MARKED WITH BLOOD

601
00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:51.230
THOSE SLEEPY TWO OF HIS OWN CHAMBER

602
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.770
AND USED THEIR VERY DAGGERS, THAT THEY HAVE DONE 'T?

603
00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.200
WHO DARES RECEIVE IT OTHER,

604
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.130
AS WE SHALL MAKE OUR GRIEFS

605
00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:00.830
AND CLAMOR ROAR UPON HIS DEATH?

606
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:02.570
I AM SETTLED,

607
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:05.100
AND BEND UP EACH CORPORAL AGENT

608
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.030
TO THIS TERRIBLE FEAT.

609
00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:08.800
AWAY,

610
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:14.370
AND MOCK THE TIME WITH FAIREST SHOW.

611
00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:20.700
FALSE FACE MUST HIDE WHAT THE FALSE HEART DOTH KNOW.

612
00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.100
[men pounding table]

613
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:38.870
