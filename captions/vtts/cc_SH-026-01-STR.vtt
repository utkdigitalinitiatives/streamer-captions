527
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:31.130
AND PITY,LIKE A NAKED NEWBORN BABE,

528
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.900
STRIDING THE BLAST,

529
00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.470
OR HEAVEN'S CHERUBIN,

530
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:36.800
HORSED UPON THE SIGHTLESSCOURIERS OF THE AIR,

531
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.230
SHALL BLOW THE HORRID DEEDIN EVERY EYE,

532
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:44.470
THAT TEARS SHALL DROWN THE WIND.

533
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:46.770
[sighs]

534
00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:52.930
I HAVE NO SPURTO PRICK THE SIDES OF MY INTENT,

535
00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:56.130
ONLY VAULTING AMBITION,WHICH O'ERLEAPS ITSELF

536
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:57.530
AND FALLS ON THE OTHER--

537
00:29:58.770 --> 00:29:59.930
HOW NOW?  WHAT NEWS?

538
00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:01.070

542
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:07.370
WE WILL PROCEED NO FURTHERIN THIS BUSINESS.

543
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.100
HE HATH HONORED MEOF LATE,

AND I HAVE BOUGHTGOLDEN OPINIONS

545

FROM ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE,

546
00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.770
WHICH WOULD BE WORN NOWIN THEIR NEWEST GLOSS,

547
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:16.500
NOT CAST ASIDE SO SOON.

548
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:20.400
WAS THE HOPE DRUNKWHEREIN YOU DRESSED YOURSELF?

549
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.500
HATH IT SLEPT SINCE?

550
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.800

AND LIVE A COWARDIN THINE OWN ESTEEM,

559
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:48.100
LETTING "I DARE NOT"WAIT UPON "I WOULD,"

560

I DARE DO ALLTHAT MAY BECOME A MAN.

563
00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:54.300
WHO DARES DO MORE IS NONE.

564
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.830
WHAT BEAST WAS 'T THEN

565
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.830
THAT MADE YOU BREAKTHIS ENTERPRISE TO ME?

566
00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:01.130
WHEN YOU DURST DO IT,THEN YOU WERE A MAN,

YET YOU WOULD MAKE BOTH.

571
00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.600
THEY HAVE MADE THEMSELVES,

572
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.370
AND THAT, THEIR FITNESS,NOW DOES UNMAKE YOU.

573
00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:26.830
I HAVE GIVEN SUCK,AND KNOW HOW TENDER 'TIS

574
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:29.730
TO LOVE THE BABETHAT MILKS ME.

575
00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:33.570
I WOULD, WHILE ITWAS SMILING IN MY FACE,
