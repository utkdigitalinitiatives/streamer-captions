ACNE IS DIFFERENT NOW.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
PERSONALLY IT'S BIGGER HIPS

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'M FAT.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
ACNE'S DIFFERENT

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
CHALLENGE TO BOYS.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
SHE WANTS TO
BE INDEPENDENT.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I LOST MY CHILDHOOD?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.000
HELLO

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.000
HEY

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
HEY

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
HEY

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
RRRRH

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
WHAT MAKES TEENAGERS
 SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
SPECIES?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
OH GOD.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
IN HUMAN TEENS, PUBERTY
 HAPPENS LATER AND LASTS

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
LONGER THAN IN
 ANY OTHER ANIMAL.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
AS THEY TURN FROM CHILD TO
 ADULT AMAZING THINGS GO ON

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
IN THE BODY AND THE MIND.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
AND WE EXPLORE THOSE
 CHANGES IN REMARKABLE

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
SCIENTIFIC DETAIL.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
BLLHHH

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
TEENAGERS HAVE TALKED
 TO US WITH UNPARALLELED

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
FRANKNESS AND INTIMACY.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.000
NO COMMENT.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
TONIGHT WE
 EXAMINE THE GIRLS.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
SPOTS AND ALL.

AGES OF 11 AND 16.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
OUR OLDEST SHARMAINE
 HAS A PROBLEM.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
FIRST I GOT
SHOUTED AT

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
TONIGHT I GOT SHOUTED AT

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
WHY ARE TEENAGE GIRLS
 SO DIFFICULT TO LIVE WITH?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
HOW DO I KNOW WHEN
YOUR TELLING THE TRUTH?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I DON'T KNOW.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
YOU SHOULD BELIEVE ME.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
CLAUDIA'S DANCING
 CAREER IS UNDER THREAT.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.000
FROM HER BODY.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
WELL THAT'S MY BABES...

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
ALEX FACES THE HORRORS OF
 DEVELOPING YEARS AHEAD OF

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
HER TIME.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
AND IDENTICAL TWINS,
 REBECCA AND JESSICA SIMPLY

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
DREAD THE FUTURE.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO GROW UP BECAUSE,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
IT'S BETTER TO BE A KID.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
LAUGHTER

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
BUT WILL THEIR IDENTICAL
 GENES SHAPE THEIR ATTITUDES

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
AS WELL AS THEIR BIOLOGY?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
HOW SIMILAR WILL THEY BE
 WHEN THEY TURN THIRTEEN?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
WE STAY WITH
 ALL OUR GIRLS,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
FOR TWO YEARS AS THEY GO
 THROUGH THE MOST CRUCIAL

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
STAGES OF THEIR LIVES.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
YEAH

MUSIC

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
FIRST OUR YOUNGEST.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
REBECCA AND JESSICA
 ARE JUST 11-YEARS-OLD.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I'M REBECCA.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
AND I'M JESSICA.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I'M REBECCA.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.000
AND I'M JESSICA.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
SHE DOES SCREAM A LOT.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
IT'S NOT THAT SHE'S
THE SAME AGE AS ME.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
THESE ARE ME AND
MY SISTERS FISH.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
THESE ARE MY SISTERS
TOYS AND THAT'S MY SISTER

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
THIS IS MY NANNY.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
THIS IS INTERVIEWING
MY NANNY.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
HELLO

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
WHAT IS IT LIKE
WITH GRANDCHILDREN?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE
HELPFUL IF YOU HAD BEEN

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
LESS IDENTICAL, CAUSE
I CAN'T TELL YOU APART.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
MUSIC

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
REBECCA ON THE RIGHT,
 IS JUST TWO MINUTES OLDER

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
THAN HER SISTER JESSICA.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
BEING IDENTICAL TWINS
 MEANS MORE THAN JUST

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
LOOKING ALIKE.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
THE GIRLS LEARN TO WALK
 AND TALK AT THE SAME TIME

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
AS EACH OTHER.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
AT 11, THEY SHARE
 INTERESTS AND FRIENDS.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
THEY HAVE NOT YET
 STARTED PUBERTY.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
BUT THEY HAVE A PRETTY
 GOOD IDEA OF WHAT'S

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
COMING.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
WELP, FIRST OF ALL WE GET
BIGGER HIPS AND YOU GET

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
TALLER AND YOU GET MUCH
STRONGER, AND WHAT ELSE.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
AND THEN YOU GET, KIND
OF LIKE, WHICH I'M NOT GOING

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
TO GET, FOR A WHILE.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
LAUGHTER

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
WOULD YOU
 STOP BLINKING.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE
 NOT STARTED TO DEVELOP.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
THE TWINS ARE DRESSING TO
 THE NINES FOR TONIGHT'S

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
LEAVER'S DISCO FOR
 THEIR PRIMARY SCHOOL.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:24.000
(MUSIC)

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.000
ARE WE READY?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
OH YES.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
IT TAKES FOUR YEARS
 FOR A GIRL TO BE FULLY

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
TRANSFORMED INTO AN ADULT.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
IT CAN START ANYTIME
 BETWEEN 8 AND 13.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
BUT UNLIKE THE TWINS, MOST
 11 YEAR OLDS DO SHOW SOME

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
SIGNS.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
SOME OF THE GIRLS, LIKE
HAVE BOYFRIENDS AND STUFF

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
AND THEY REALLY, THEY WANT
TO BE GROWN-UPS REALLY FAST.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
THEY DON'T REALLY GOT
A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
BUT THEY HAVE.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
THEY DON'T REALLY
PLAY LIKE SILLY GAMES.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
(MUSIC)

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
PUBERTY IS DRIVEN BY
A CRUCIAL COCKTAIL OF

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
HORMONES.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
GROWTH HORMONES.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
CORTISOL, ESTROGEN
AND PROGESTERONE.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
THEY MAKE
BEAUTIFUL CRYSTALS,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
BUT NORMALLY THEIR
DISSOLVED IN THE BLOOD.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
MUSIC

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
A FEW MONTHS
AFTER THE DISCO.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
UN-BE NOTICED TO THE TWINS,
THEIR HORMONES ARE FORCING

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
THEIR BODIES TO CHANGE.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
IT HAPPENS AT NIGHT.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
MUSIC

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
AN HOUR AFTER THE
GIRLS FALL ASLEEP,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
THEIR BRAINS GO TO WORK.

MUSIC

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
HORMONES TRAVEL DOWN
THE BLOOD VESSELS TO THE

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
OVARIES WHICH START
PULSING ESTROGEN INTO THE

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
BLOOD STREAM.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
MUSIC

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
THE CASCADE OF
PUBERTY HAS BEGUN.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
MUSIC

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
AT FIRST, SMALL DOSES
OF ESTROGEN ARE RELEASED

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
EVERY 90 MINUTES.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS,
THE PULSES GET LONGER AND

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
MORE FREQUENT.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
UNTIL THERE IS A CONTINUOUS
STREAM OF ESTROGEN IN THE

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
BLOOD.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
THIS TRIGGERS A CHANGE,
THAT GIRLS THEMSELVES

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
FIRST NOTICE.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
MY FRIEND, NAN.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
UM, SHE'S GOTTEN BIGGER.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
AND, AND SHE LOOKS
FLUFFY IN ALL THESE TOPS.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
BECAUSE IT GOES LIKE THIS.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
(LAUGHTER)

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
AND, AND SHE
LOOKS REALLY NICE,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
BUT WHEN YOU GOT A
FLAT CHEST, LIKE ME,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
IT DOESN'T
REALLY LOOK NICE.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
MUSIC

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
HUMANS ARE THE ONLY
 SPECIES THAT DEVELOP

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
BREASTS BEFORE
 THEY GET PREGNANT.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
BREASTS FIRST BECOME
 VISIBLE AS MILK DUCKS GROW

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
BEHIND THE NIPPLE.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
THEN FAT COLLECTS AROUND
 THE MILK DUCTS AND AROUND

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
THE NIPPLE ITSELF.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
BENEATH THE DARK
 CIRCLE OF THE AREOLA,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
SWEAT GLANDS AND
 SCENT GLANDS DEVELOP.

MUSIC

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
USUALLY BREASTS
 COME FIRST.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
THE WAR HAPPENS WHEN
 THINGS DON'T GO ACCORDING

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
TO PLAN.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
ALEX IS 10 YEARS OLD.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
THREE YEARS AGO
 WHEN SHE WAS JUST 7,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
SOMETHING
 FRIGHTENING HAPPENED.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000

COME ON ALEX, GO!

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.000
GO ALEX!

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
MOOD CHANGES WERE
THE FIRST THING.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
THEN TEMPER TANTRUMS
BECAME LIKE IRATE

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
TEMPER TANTRUMS.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I DIDN'T WANT TO
GET NEAR MY MOM AT ALL.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
AND I WOULD GET MAD
AT HER FOR NOTHING.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
HER MOODS WERE, JUST ANY
GIVEN POINT WERE OFF THE

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.000
WALL.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
KATHY WAS WORRIED THAT
 HER LITTLE GIRL WAS

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
MENTALLY ILL.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I REMEMBER JUST
FRETTING AND MY HUSBAND

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
FRETTING, WHAT
COULD BE THE PROBLEM.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
UH, CAN SHE BE THIS
UNHAPPY AND HOW CAN A

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
CHILD WHO WAS SO HAPPY
3 MONTHS AGO BE SO SAD.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
ALEX HAD BEEN ADOPTED BY
 KATHY AND HER HUSBAND WHEN

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
SHE WAS 5.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
SHE SPENT HER EARLY YEARS
 IN A ROMANIAN ORPHANAGE.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
COULD THIS STILL BE
 AFFECTING HER MIND?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
MUSIC

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
KATHY WAS ANXIOUS AND
 TOOK ALEX TO SEE A DOCTOR.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
BUT HE DIDN'T OFFER
 THERAPY OR MEDICATION.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
INSTEAD, HE TOOK AN
 X-RAY OF ALEX'S HAND.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
THIS IS THE X-RAY
 OF A 2 YEAR OLD.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
THE GAPS BETWEEN
 THE BONES ARE WIDE.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
THEY LOOK DARK BECAUSE
 THEY ARE FILLED WITH

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
CARTILAGE WHICH DOES
 NOT SHOW UP ON X-RAYS.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
IT'S ALSO WHAT MAKES
 YOUNG HANDS FEEL FLOPPY.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000
AS THE HAND GROWS TO ADULT
 SIZE, THE GAPS NARROW.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
THIS IS ALEX'S X-RAY.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
AT 7 YEARS OLD, SHE HAD
 THE HANDS OF A TEENAGER.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
AND THE REST OF HER
 BODY WAS NOT FAR BEHIND.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
BY THE TIME HER BONE
SCAN WAS COMPLETED,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
SHE AT THAT POINT HAD
HAD COMPLETE NIPPLE

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
DEVELOPMENT.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
SHE WAS SO ODD LOOKING, BY
COMPARISON TO SOME OF THE

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
OTHER GIRLS.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
MY CHEST WAS BIGGER.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
IT'S JUST THAT YOU
LOOK DIFFERENT,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
AND YOUR TALLER.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
YOU JUST DON'T BLEND IN
WITH THE OTHER GIRLS.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I DID MIND A LOT BECAUSE
I SMELLED MORE STINKY.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
AND LIKE BECAUSE I
WAS SWEATING A LOT,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
SO I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE
MORE SHOWERS, AND PUT, UM,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
DEODORANT ON ME.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
WHICH WAS REALLY VERY
INTERESTING BECAUSE AT 7

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
THEIR REALLY RESISTANT
TO WEARING DEODORANT.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
"I DON'T NEED THIS."

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
OH, YES YOU DO.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
DOES IT MATTER IF
A GIRL DEVELOPS YEARS

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
EARLIER THAN HER FRIENDS.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
PSYCHOLOGIST JEAN
BROOKS-GUNN THINKS IT DOES.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
THIS CHILD STANDS OUT
IN STARK CONTRAST TO

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
EVERYBODY ELSE.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
IT RELATES TO
SELF-CONSCIENCENESS

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
THAT THE
GIRLS MIGHT HAVE.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
IT RELATES TO NEGATIVE
FEELINGS ABOUT BODY IMAGE.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
GIRLS WHO ARE EARLY MIGHT
ALSO SHOW DEPRESSIVE

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
SYMPTOMS, BECAUSE OF
THE FACT THAT THERE IS A

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
DIFFERENCE.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
BEING DIFFERENT,
 IS DIFFICULT.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
WHAT PARENTS AND TEACHERS
MAY DO IF THEY SEE A GIRL

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
DEVELOPING EARLY IS TO
THINK THAT THAT GIRL IS

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
MORE ADVANCED EMOTIONALLY
THAN SHE REALLY IS.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
PARENTS MAY START GIVING
HER FREEDOM AS THOUGH SHE

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
IS MATURE, BUT THE
IMPORTANT FACT IS,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
IS THE PHYSICAL
DEVELOPMENT AND EMOTIONAL

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
DEVELOPMENT
ARE NOT LINKED.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
EARLY DEVELOPERS DO
 NOT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE TO

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
COPE WITH PUBERTY.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
AND THE RESULTS
 CAN BE TRAGIC.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES,
 THEY ARE 3 TIMES AS LIKELY

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
TO SUFFER FROM AN
 EATING DISORDER,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
TWICE AS LIKELY
 TO TAKE DRUGS,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
AND TWICE AS LIKELY
 TO ATTEMPT SUICIDE.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
AS GIRLS WHO
 DEVELOP LATER.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
ALEX'S PARENTS DID NOT
 WANT THEIR 7 YEAR OLD TO

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
GROW UP SO FAST.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
WE KNEW THAT SHE HAD BEEN
RAISED IN AN INSTITUTION

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
AND SHE HAD NO CHILDHOOD.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
SO THIS WAS ONLY TWO IN
A HALF YEARS OF CHILDHOOD

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
FOR HER.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
AND WE REALLY FELT THAT
SHE WAS GETTING ROBBED.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
ALEX WAS GIVEN MEDICAL
 TREATMENT TO REVERSE THE

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
EFFECTS OF THE HORMONES.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
HER BREASTS DISAPPEARED.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
HER MOODS RETURNED
 TO NORMAL.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
SHE BECAME A CHILD AGAIN.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
BUT WHY DID SHE
 START SO EARLY?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
TIMING DEPENDS ON BOTH,
 WHAT GIRLS ARE BORN WITH,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
THEIR GENES AND THE
 WORLD THEY LIVE IN.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
RACE CAN MAKE
 A DIFFERENCE.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
BLACK GIRLS GENERALLY
 DEVELOP EARLIER THAN WHITE

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
GIRLS.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
NO ONE STUDY ROMANIANS.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
FOR ALEX, IT WAS
 PROBABLY SOMETHING ELSE.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
GIRLS WITH A STABLE FAMILY
 LIFE TEND TO DEVELOP LATER

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
THAN AVERAGE.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
AND STRESSED CHILDREN
 DEVELOP EARLIER.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
SO THE YEARS ALEX SPENT
 IN THE ROMANIAN ORPHANAGE

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
MIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR
 HER EARLY DEVELOPMENT.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
BUT NORMALLY, THE MOST
 IMPORTANT FACTOR, IS FAT.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
IT'S JUST BEEN DISCOVERED
 THAT FAT HAS AN

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
EXTRAORDINARY
 IMPACT ON PUBERTY.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
THESE LITTLE
 ROUND FAT CELLS,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE
 BODY DO SOMETHING AMAZING.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
THEY CONTINUOUSLY RELEASE
 A HORMONE INTO THE BLOOD

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
STREAM, THATSEEM
 DIRECTLY TO THE BRAIN.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
THE BRAIN WILL NOT SET
 PUBERTY GOING UNTIL IT

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
DETECTS THAT THERE IS
 ENOUGH FAT ON BOARD TO

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
FUEL THE TEENAGE
 GROWTH SPURTS.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
CHILDREN ARE MUCH FATTER
 THAN WHAT THEY USED TO BE.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
ALMOST A QUARTER
 ARE OVER WEIGHT.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
AND THIS IS DRIVING
 PUBERTY BACK.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
TODAY, MANY GIRLS START
 DEVELOPING BREASTS WHEN

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
THEIR JUST 9 YEARS OLD.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
BUT NOT THE TWINS.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
IT'S SEPTEMBER 2000.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
HELLO, UM

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I AM WITHOUT BREASTS.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
HELLO,
UM, TOMORROW IS

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
OUR FIRST DAY
OF SECONDARY SCHOOL

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
AND UM, I'M REALLY
SCARED ABOUT IT.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
TOMORROW IS OUR FIRST
DAY OF SECONDARY SCHOOL

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
AND WE ARE REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY, REALLY,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
REALLY, REALLY SCARED.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I'M EXCITED BECAUSE I'M
MAKING AN EARLY START,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
AND THAT'S MY
MOM BEHIND ME.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
HELLO

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
I DON'T KNOW
ANYONE THERE.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A
SCHOOL ON THE DAY,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
WHEN PEOPLE WENT.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
STOP IT JESSICA!

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
MUSIC

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
THE TWINS ARE ON
 THEIR WAY TO THE BIGGEST

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
SECONDARY SCHOOL
 IN LONDON.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS
 COME HERE EVERYDAY.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
STARTING SENIOR SCHOOL IS
 A SCARY PROSPECT FOR ANY

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
11 YEAR OLD.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
BUT FOR THE TWINS IT'S
 GOING TO BE EVEN HARDER.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
THEY HAD ONLY SPENT
 BUT A FEW DAYS APART.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
WE ARE GOING TO BE IN
DIFFERENT CLASSES AND SHE

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
IS GOING TO BE IN ONE
CLASS AND I AM GOING TO BE

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
IN ANOTHER.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
DIFFERENT TEACHERS BUT WE

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
WILL SEE EACH
OTHER AT PLAYTIMES.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
BUT WILL WE SEE EACH
OTHER AT PLAYTIMES?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
OF COURSE, DUH.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
AND AT LUNCH TIME.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
THERE'S ANOTHER WORRY
THAT THE TWINS SHARE WITH

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
MANY CHILDREN HERE TODAY.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
IT'S BEEN PREYING ON
THEIR MINDS FOR MONTHS.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
THEY MIGHT, UM,
FORCE ME TO SMOKE AND

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
THEY MIGHT BULLY ME.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
AND WHAT
IF I HAVE TO,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
THEY MIGHT BEAT ME UP.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
I THINK BULLYING IS A
MASSIVE ISSUE FOR TEENAGERS.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
ALMOST EVERYONE IN
THEIR SCHOOL TIME,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
SUFFERS BULLYING
AT SOME STAGE OR

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
IS VERY AWARE OF IT.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
IT HAPPENS TO
SOMEONE CLOSE BY.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
CHARLIE REDMAN RUNS
BRITAIN'S MOST POPULAR

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
WEB SITE FOR TEENAGE GIRLS.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
EVERY MONTH 300,000
OF THEM LOG ON.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
THE WEB SITE RUNS FEATURES
ON ENTERTAINMENT AND FUN.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
THAT IS WHAT HE THOUGHT
GIRLS WOULD BE INTERESTED IN.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
WHEN HE POSTED A
SURVEY ON BULLYING,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
HE WAS IN FOR A SURPRISE.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
NORMALLY WITH OUR SERVICE
WE GIVE AWAY A PRIZE.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
THIS TIME WE WEREN'T
GIVING AWAY A PRIZE AND IT

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
WAS ABOUT A SERIOUS ISSUE.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
WE GOT JUST OVER 1300
ANSWERS TO THE SURVEY IN A

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
TWO-DAY PERIOD.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
SO I THINK WHAT THAT
SHOWED WAS THAT SOMETHING

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
THAT WAS A LOT OF TEENAGE
GIRLS USE THE WEB SITE FELT

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
VERY STRONGLY ABOUT IT

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
THE ANONYMITY OF
 CYBERSPACE REVEALED LEVELS

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
OF BULLYING AMONG GIRLS,
 NEVER BEFORE SUSPECTED.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
THE VAST MAJORITY OF
BULLYING THAT TAKES PLACE

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
IS MENTAL BULLYING.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
MENTAL ABUSE AND TEASING,
GANGING UP ON HIM OR HER.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
AND ALL TEENAGERS ARE
DESPERATE TO FIT IN,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
TO BE ACCEPTED.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
UM, AND YOU KNOW BULLYING
REALLY IS GOING AGAINST

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
MUSIC

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
ACROSS THE UK ONE IN
TEN STUDENTS IN SECONDARY

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
SCHOOL GET BULLIED
AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
AND EACH YEAR, AT LEAST
15 BULLIED TEENAGERS KILL

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
THEMSELVES.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
THE CONCERN I THINK
THAT WE HAD WAS THAT 70%

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
OF IT WAS NEVER REPORTED
TO EITHER PARENTS OR

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
INDEED TO TEACHERS.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
UM, SO WHILE IT
IS A HUGE ISSUE,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ONE
THAT THAT THE TEACHERS

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
KNOW THE EXTENT OF.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
MUSIC

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:08.000
MOM, I'M NOT GOING TO BE
THE ONLY GIRL IN MY CLASS.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
MOM, CAN YOU TAKE THIS

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
IF WE CAN ALL
LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
FOR JUST A MOMENT.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
WE ARE GOING TO LINE YOU
UP AND CHOOSE THE GROUPS

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
AND THEN IN A COUPLE OF
MINUTES YOUR TUTORS WILL

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
BE TAKING YOU IN...

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO
AVOID BEING BULLIED IS TO

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
FIT IN.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
FASHION IS VITALLY
IMPORTANT TO TEENAGERS.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
MUSIC

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
THE WEB SITE UPDATES
ITS PAGES EVERYDAY.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
SO IS TO STAY RIGHT ON
TOP OF TEEN CULTURE,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.000
WHATEVER THAT IS.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
IT IS HARD TO
DEFINE TEEN CULTURE.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
TEEN CULTURE CHANGES,
FROM DAY TO DAY.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
UM, IT IS ENORMOUSLY
TRANSPOSING AND WHAT WE

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
TRY TO DO AS A SITE IS GET
FEEDBACK FROM TEENAGERS.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
WHAT IS INTERESTING
TO THEM?

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
THEY DO THIS BY RUNNING
REGULAR FOCUS GROUPS.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
THIS IS BASICALLY A
WEB SITE FOR TEENAGE GIRLS.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
THE WEB SITE MAKES ITS
MONEY BY ADVERTISING

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
FASHION AND BEAUTY
PRODUCTS AIMED AT TEENAGE

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
GIRLS.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
AND TEENAGE GIRLS
CAN BE BIG SPENDERS.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
IN AN AVERAGE MONTH,
WHAT DO YOU TYPICALLY

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
SPEND ON CLOTHES?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
PROBABLY, UM, PROBABLY
ABOUT $250 TO $300.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
(LAUGHTER)

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
IN THE YEAR 2000 TEENAGE
SPENDING IN THE UK WAS

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
WORTH $20 BILLION SO ALL
THAT SHOWS IS THAT THEY

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
HAVE A VERY HIGH
DISPOSABLE INCOME AND THE

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
ONE THING WITH TEENAGERS
IS THEY DISPOSE OF IT TOO.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
OF THAT 20 BILLION, GIRLS
SPEND 7 MILLION POUNDS ON

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
LIPSTICK, 46 MILLION ON
PERFUME AND 185 MILLION

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
POUNDS ON CD'S.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
IT ANNOYING WHEN YOUR
KISSING PEOPLE HELLO.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
OR JUST KISSING
PEOPLE IN GENERAL.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
CLAUDIA IS 14, WE FIRST
MET HER 2 YEARS AGO,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
WHEN SHE WAS JUST 12.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
HEY WELCOME TO TEENAGE
SPECIES, I'M CLAUDIA.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
I GO TO ARTS EDUCATION
SCHOOL AND TRAINING.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
I'M HERE TO DO A
DOCUMENTARY AND A

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
VIDEO DIARY ON ME

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
WELL HERE I AM.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
HEY.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
MUSIC

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
I LIKE BEING A
TEENAGER IT'S FUN.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE RESPONSIBLE.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.000
I DON'T KNOW-- YOU
CAN JUST HAVE MORE FUN.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
IT'S LIKE WHEN
I GO SHOPPING,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
I DON'T HAVE TO RELY
ON A JOB FOR THE MONEY.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
I CAN JUST SPEAK TO MY MOM
AND BE LIKE COME ON AND

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
JUST LITTLE THINGS LIKE
THAT, IT'S JUST BETTER.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
BUT A, WHEN
YOU'RE A TEENAGER,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
ONCE IT'S FINISHED
YOUR NOT GONNA HAVE IT

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
EVER AGAIN.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
SO YOU MIGHT AS
WELL JUST ENJOY IT.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
AND THAT'S HOW I
THINK ABOUT IT ANYWAY.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
BUT DESPITE
 APPEARANCES,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
CLAUDIA IS IN TROUBLE.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
MUSIC

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
CLAUDIA IS A DANCER AND
SHE IS VERY AMBITIOUS.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
YOU JUST GET SO EXCITED.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
I JUST LOVE PERFORMING,
I REALLY, REALLY LOVE,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
I'M JUST SO PASSION,
I REALLY LOVE ACTING,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
SINGING AND DANCING.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
IT'S EVERYTHING TO ME.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
I REALLY, REALLY
LOVE TO PERFORM.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
UNFORTUNATELY,
 CLAUDIA HAS LOST CONTROL

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
OF HER BODY.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
TRY AND HOLD ON
TO YOUR CENTER.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I KNOW IT'S ALRIGHT.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
AND ALL THE WAY UP.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
ALRIGHT, NOTICE HOW YOUR
BODY WANTS TO STAY TO FAR

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
BACKWARDS, SO I THINK IF
TIGHTENING YOUR BELLY,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
LINING UP OVER YOUR
KNEE AND OVER YOUR FOOT.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
SO BRING THE MIDDLE OF
YOU OVER TO YOUR FOOT,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
SO YOU PROBABLY NEED
TO COME FORWARD.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
EVERYTHING IS WRONG AND
EVERYTHING IN MY BODY

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
IS WRONG.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
IT'S REALLY BAD BECAUSE
YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR TRYING

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
SO HARD AND EVERYTHING YOU
TRY, JUST DOESN'T WORK.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
CLAUDIA HAS DANCED
SERIOUSLY SINCE SHE WAS 3

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
YEARS OLD.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
FOR THE PAST 6 YEARS SHE
HAS A ATTENDED A THEATER

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
ART SCHOOL IN
HARTFORDSHIRE.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
WE HAVE STEP
BALL CHANGE

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
SHE SPENDS 30 HOURS
A WEEK IN TRAINING.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
PLIÉ FROM THERE

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
NOW THE TROUBLE
IS SHE'S GROWING.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
CIRCULAR SPREAD.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
MUSIC

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
DURING PUBERTY, THE
SKELETON GROWS IN A SET

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
ORDER.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
HANDS AND FEET GROW FIRST.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
THEN THE FOREARM AND SHIN.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
AND THEN THE UPPER
ARM AND THIGH.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
THE LEGS USUALLY START
WHEN A GIRL STARTS HER

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
PERIODS.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
BUT THE SPINE CONTINUES TO
GROW UNTIL SHE REACHES HER

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
FULL ADULT HEIGHT.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
AT ABOUT 14 YEARS OLD.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
YOU MUST BE NICE AND
STRAIGHT WITH YOUR BACK.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
HOW TALL AM I?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
5 FOOT
5 AND A HALF.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
THAT'S 1 AND A HALF
INCHES SINCE SEPTEMBER.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
AT 12 CLAUDIA
 IS AVERAGE HEIGHT.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
BUT SHE SHOT UP 6 ½
 INCHES THAT'S ABOUT 17

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
CENTIMETERS IN
 THE PAST YEAR.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
LOW, THAT'S LOW.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
GROWING SO FAST, IT'S
 NO WONDER SHE'S LOSING HER

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
BALANCE.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
MUSIC

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
YOUR BALANCE GOES
COMPLETELY AWAY.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
I KNOW, IT'S ALRIGHT.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
MUSIC

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
THE EXTRAORDINARY
 GROWTH OF ADOLESCENCE IS

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF
 CELLS CALLED OSTEOCLASTS.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000
THEY ARE UNIQUE BECAUSE
 THEIR DESIGNED TO DESTROY.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,
 WE FILMED TINY OSTEOCLASTS

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
MERGING INTO MASSIVE NEW
 CELLS THAT MAKE ACID.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
YOU CAN SEE IT HAPPENING
 AT THE RIGHT OF THE

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
SCREEN.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
THE ACID FACTORIES
 SCULPTED THE BONES INTO

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
SHAPE, BY PUMPING ACID
 ONTO THE SURFACE AND

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
DISSOLVING THEM AWAY.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
IF IT WERE NOT
 FOR OSTEOCLASTS,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
WE SIMPLY WOULD NOT
 END UP THE RIGHT SHAPE.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRLS
 CAN BE AS MUCH AS 40

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
CENTIMETERS
 DIFFERENT IN HEIGHT.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
CLAUDIA IS ONE OF THE
 TALLEST IN HER YEAR.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
SHE USED TO LIKE THE
 IDEA OF BEING TALL AND

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
WILLOWY.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
BUT NOW SHE IS,
 IT'S NOT MUCH FUN.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT
WHEN YOU'RE THE BIGGEST

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
ONE OR THE TALLEST ONE,
OR SOMETHING DIFFERENT

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
COMPARED TO EVERYONE ELSE.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
ESPECIALLY TODAY
WITH JARED,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
BECAUSE SHE IS SO SMALL
AND PETITE AND SHE CAN GET

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
HER LEGS AND DO THE SPLITS
EASILY AND EVERYTHING.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
AND IF YOU LOOK IN THE
MIRROR AND SHE'S STANDING

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
NEXT TO YOU, YOU'RE A BIT
OF A MONSTER COMPARED TO

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
HER.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
LAUGHTER

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
AND THERE'S
ANOTHER PROBLEM.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
DURING THE GROWTH SPURT,
BONES GROW FASTER,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
THAN MUSCLES.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
MUSCLES LAG WELL BEHIND.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
CLAUDIA HAS GOT
LOVELY LONG LEGS,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
BUT AT THE MOMENT NO
MUSCLE STRENGTH TO CONTROL

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
HER LEGS.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
THEY CAN GROW UP TO
A PHENOMENAL RATE,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
ABOUT A CENTIMETER
A MONTH.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
WHICH MEANS THAT ONCE THEY
HAVE THESE LONG LEGS THEY

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
DON'T HAVE THE MUSCLES
TO CONTROL THEM.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
AND REST, A MOMENT,
CLAUDIA CAN YOU CONNECT A

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
SECOND.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
AT THE MOMENT
CLAUDIA'S GOT ENOUGH

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
STRENGTH
TO HOLD IT THERE.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
ALRIGHT, TAKE YOUR TIME.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
CLAUDIA IS REALLY QUIT
FLEXIBLE AND WHEN SHE'S

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
OLDER AND STRONGER SHE
WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD HER

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
LEG UP THERE QUIT SOON.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
AS SOON AS THE MUSCLE HAS
CAUGHT UP TO THE LEGS SHE

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD HER
LEG UP ALL BY HERSELF.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
WON'T THAT BE FUN.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
ALRIGHT, LET'S START IT
AGAIN WITH THE MUSIC.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
READY, THANK YOU.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
PROPER.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
MUSIC

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
AND ONE.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
THEY HAVE THESE
TREMENDOUS HORMONAL RUSHES

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
AS EVERY PARENT OF A
TEENAGER WILL KNOW AND THE

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
DANGER HERE IS THAT
PREVIOUSLY STRONG

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
CONFIDENT CHILD CAN LOSE
THEIR SELF-ESTEEM AND LOSE

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
THEIR CONFIDENCE AS THEY
PERCEIVE THEIR LACK OF

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
STRENGTH TO BE DECREASE
IN ABILITY AND IN TALENT.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
IT'S REALLY BAD BECAUSE
I WANT TO BE BETTER AND I

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
WANT IT TO ALL
HAPPEN SO QUICKLY.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY IT
DOESN'T SO I GOT TO WAIT.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
INSECURITY IS
TYPICAL TEENAGE TERRITORY,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY
EMOTION RESPONSE TO

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
SURGING HORMONES.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
TODAY IS SATURDAY, THE
15 OF JULY AND I'M GETTING

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
READY TO GO TO
MY COUSINS PARTY.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
AND I'VE BEEN
KIND OF EXCITED,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT REALLY.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
YOU KNOW THE THOUGHT
OF IT, IT JUST LOOKS,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
YOU KNOW GREAT, FOR I
WORE A BLACK TOP HERE.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
AND IT WAS A BIT LONG.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
I WANTED MY MOM
TO STOP SHOUTING.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
SHARMAINE THIS
IN WITH HER MOTHER,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
TWO SISTERS AND
HER BROTHER.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
NOT PEDDLE PUSHERS.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
WELL LOOK

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
SHARMAINE IS 14.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
PHYSICALLY SHE'S
ALMOST FULLY DEVELOPED.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
BUT HER FAMILY ARE NOT
SO SURE ABOUT THE REST.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
I GOT ENOUGH ANYWAY.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
SHARMAINE IS
A COMPLETE PEST.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
SHE'S A PEST.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
YEAH, I THINK I'M
A PEST, BECAUSE

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
I'LL DO IT ON
PEOPLES NERVES.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
I'LL GET ON SAM'S NERVES.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
SHE JUST THINKS SHE'S
NEAT AND SHE'S JUST NOT.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
WHAT I DO ON PURPOSE,
I DON'T REALLY.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
SOMETIMES I DO TO SAM.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
SHE TRY'S TO GET ME IN
TROUBLE. BUT I DON'T

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
BELIEVE HER BECAUSE
SHE TELLS LIES.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
OBVIOUSLY, I'M
A PEST TO STEPHANIE.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:02.000
SHE GETS
ON MY NERVES.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
SHE GETS UPSET.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
I CAN'T STAND HER.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
I'M NOT THAT REALLY
A PEST TO LOX'S.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
SHE GETS
ONTO ME.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
NAH, NOT TO LOX'S.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
I THINK SHE'S
SCARED OF ME.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
SHARMAINE DO
YOU LIKE THESE?

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
THEY'RE FOR BIG PEOPLE.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
KIDS DON'T WEAR THEM.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
YOU MEAN BIG PEOPLE.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
IT'S NOT JUST THE
BROTHER AND SISTERS WHO

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH SHARMAINE.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
WHEN SHARMAINE WAS
YOUNGER SHE USED TO LISTEN

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
TO EVERYTHING I SAY.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
NOW SHE'S REACHED
HER TEENS.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
SHE WANTS TO
BE INDEPENDENT.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
THEY'RE HORRIBLE.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
YOU LIKE THIS,
DO YA.?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
NO.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE HER THAT

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
INDEPENDENCE.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
LET GO, BUT THERE ARE
MANY KIDS THAT ARE MAKING

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
MISTAKES IN LIFE AND I'M
TRYING TO PREVENT HER FROM

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
MAKING THOSE MISTAKES.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
SHARMAINE.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
NO WAY.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
IT SHOWS ALL YOUR BELLY.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
I HAD MY FIRST
CHILD AT 18.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
THERE'S NO WAY ON THIS
EARTH SHARMAINE WILL BE

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
HAVING A CHILD AT 18.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
YOU KNOW I WANT
SHARMAINE TO LIVE LIFE.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
GET A GOOD EDUCATION.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
UNTIL THEN, I WILL ALWAYS
BE DOWN ON HER LIKE A TON

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000
OF BRICKS.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
ME AND MY MOM DON'T
TALK ABOUT THAT MUCH,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
WE ALWAYS ARGUE.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
IT IS UNIVERSAL, IT
OCCURS ACROSS CULTURES.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
DON'T KNOW WE
JUST DON'T GET ALONG

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
IT OCCURS IN
ALL CHILDREN.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
I CAN'T WAIT TILL
SHE STOPS HASSLING ME.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
IN FACT, I DON'T THINK
THAT ALL THE RESEARCH THAT

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
I HAVE EVER SEEN, THAT
I'VE SEEN A FAMILY WHO

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
DON'T HAVE ARGUMENTS
BETWEEN YOUNG TEENAGERS

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
AND THEIR PARENTS.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
TODAY, SHOUTED AT..
TONIGHT GOT SHOUTED AT...

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
FOR REALLY NO
REASON AT ALL.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
DON'T TALK FOR DAYS

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
BECAUSE YOU
SHOUT FOR NO REASON.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
I DON'T SHOUT AT
YOU FOR NO REASON.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
OF COURSE YOU DO.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
HALF THE TIME SHE DON'T
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
SHE KNOWS THE ONE THING
THAT HAS HAPPENED.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
SHE WILL SAY, "I DON'T
WANT TO HEAR YOUR SIDE."

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
MUSIC

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
THE WARNINGS OF PUBERTY
MAKES TEENAGE GIRLS

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
CHANGING LEVELS OF
ESTROGEN MAKE THEIR MOOD

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
UNRELIABLE AND
EVEN AGGRESSIVE.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
(MUSIC IN BACKGROUND)

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
THOUGH WITH GIRLS,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
IT'S USUALLY
VERBAL AGGRESSION,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
RATHER THAN
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:28.000
(MUSIC IN BACKGROUND)

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
ANY DAY IS
TIME FOR A ROW.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
MY MOM SAYS TO ME,
I WAKE UP THINKING.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
OKAY, ME
MOMS KNOWS TODAY.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
I DON'T...

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
IT JUST IS MY
MOM SHOUTS FIRST.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
I DON'T SHOUT BACK
I JUST SAY MY BIT.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
YEAH YOUR JUST
LOOKING FOR AN ARGUMENT.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
IF I'M UPSET, I START
SCREAMING AT MY BROTHERS

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
AND MY FAMILY.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
SCREAM AT MY PARENTS
AND I KNOW THAT'S WRONG.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
I DON'T KNOW.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE WE STAND.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
AND MY MOM DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND ME AT ALL.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
OUR WHOLE LIVES WE DON'T
AGREE WITH EVERYBODY AND

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
CHILDREN HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO NEGOTIATE

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
DISAGREEMENTS.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
MY BELIEF IS THAT KIDS ARE
USING ARGUING WITH THEIR

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
PARENTS TO LEARN REALLY
IMPORTANT SOCIAL SKILLS

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
THAT THEY TAKE
ON TO LATER LIFE.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
LOOK SMILE.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
YOU CAN SEE IT.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
WHAT BETTER PLACE TO
LEARN TO NEGOTIATE THAN IN

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
THE FAMILY.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
IS THE SAFEST
PLACE TO ARGUE.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
YOU CAN GET, YOU CAN
ARGUE WITH YOUR PARENTS,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
YOU CAN WALK
OUT OF THE ROOM,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
YOU CAN SCREAM AND THEY
ARE STILL GOING TO LOVE

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:37.000
YOU.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
SHARMAINE
WHO'S IT TO YOU?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
I DON'T KNOW.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
MY LEGS HAVE
GOTTEN TALLER.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
I THINK I'VE HAD A GROWTH
SPURT OR SOMETHING.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
AND MY TUMMY HAS
CERTAINLY GOTTEN BIGGER.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
I LOOK LIKE HOMER SIMPSON.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
HAPPENING WITH MY LEGS BUT

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
THEY JUST GOT REALLY
BUMPY UNDER THE SKIN.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
LIKE MOMS AND THEIR
STRETCH MARKS.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
I WANT TO HAVE
SOME SORT OF BUST.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
THE TWINS ARE NOW
12 AND THEIR SURGING

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
HORMONES ARE FINALLY
CAUSING VISIBLE CHANGES.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
AND IT'S NOT ALL WELCOME.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
(MUSIC IN BACKGROUND)

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
LOVELY, ISN'T IT.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
I LIKE THIS ONE.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
THAT'S AN A CUP.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
YOU NEED TO GROW INTO
THAT ONE JESSICA.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
IT'S PERFECT.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
GETTING A BRA HAS
MORE THAN PRACTICAL

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
SIGNIFICANCE.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
MOST GIRLS LIKE
WEARING BRAS.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
THEY THINKS IT"S
COOL, LIKE,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
SOME GIRLS WEAR
THEM FOR NOTHING.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
THEY DON'T GOT NOTHING
AND THEY JUST WEAR THEM

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000
THEY WANT TO
BE GROWN-UP.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
YEAH

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
THEY THINK THAT IF
YOUR NOT WEARING A BRA,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
THEN YOU GET LEFT BEHIND.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
MOST GIRLS IN MY
CLASS AREN'T VERY SELF

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
CONSCIOUS, AS I AM.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
THEY ARE MORE
OPEN WITH IT.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
THEY TALK ABOUT MORE
EASILY WITH THEIR FRIENDS.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
SOME OF THEM MAY EVEN
TALK ABOUT IT WITH BOYS.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
I'M SO EMBARRASSED
WHEN THEY DO THAT.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
NOW SHE'S TWELVE,
REBECCA WANTS TO FIT IN.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
SHE WANTS TO BE
LIKE THE OTHERS.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
FUN FOR THE FIRST TIME TO

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.000
WEAR IT.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
FUN.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
I MEAN, WHY JESSICA.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
JESSICA IS STILL
NOT VERY KEEN.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
THAT'S TOO SMALL

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
IT'S VERY PRETTY.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
BUT I WONDER IF IT'S GOT
ANY SUPPORT OR ANYTHING

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
LIKE THAT IN THERE.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
I MEAN IT'S IMPORTANT.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T
REALLY NEED TO WEAR A BRA,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
LIKE THE REST OF US.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
IF YOU WANT
TO WEAR A BRA.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
YOU JUST WEAR A BRA.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
(LAUGHTER)

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
(MUSIC)

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
I WANT TO HAVE
SOME SORT OF BUST.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
BUT NOT ENORMOUS ONES.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
34

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
RIGHT?

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
THERE'S NOT
MUCH DIFFERENCE.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
NO.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
SHE'S 32 AND I'M 34.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
JESSICA IS TEN MINUTES
YOUNGER THAN ME AND I'M

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
NOT SURPRISED THAT SHE'S
DEVELOPING SLOWER THAN

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
I AM.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:28.000
(MUSIC)

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:36.000
(MUSIC)

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE
IS A SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE GIRLS.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
WITH IDENTICAL
GENES THOUGH,

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
WHO WILL TAKE THE
NEXT STEP FIRST?

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
I KNOW ABOUT 3 GIRLS
WHO HAVE GOT THEIR PERIOD.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
I ASKED MY MOM, BECAUSE
I WAS GETTING A BIT

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
WORRIED .

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
I DON'T WANT TO
START MY PERIOD ANYWAY.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
CAUSE IT'S DISGUSTING.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
ALL THE CHANGES OF
 PUBERTY HAVE JUST ONE

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
PURPOSE, MAKING BABIES.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
FOR IT TO HAPPEN, GIRLS
 HAVE TO START THEIR

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
PERIODS.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY
 PROCESS.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
AT THE TOP OF THE
 SCREEN IS AN OVARY.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
IT LOOKS ENORMOUS,
 BUT IN REAL LIFE,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
IT'S ONLY THE
 SIZE OF A WALNUT.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
INSIDE IS AN EGG.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
ABOUT TO SET OFF UPON IT'S
 DIFFICULT JOURNEY TO THE

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
WOMB.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
FIRST, IT HAS TO CROSS A
 GAP THOUSANDS OF TIMES ITS

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000
OWN SIZE, FROM THE
 OVARY TO THE TOP OF THE

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
FALLOPIAN TUBE BELOW.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
IT'S CARRIED OVER IN A
 COLUMN OF STICKY ALMOST

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
SEE-THROUGH JELLY.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
SURPRISINGLY, IT
 USUALLY MAKES IT.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF
 THE POSSIBILITY OF NEW

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000
LIFE.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
(HEARTBEAT SOUNDS).

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
NEXT THE JOURNEY DOWN
 THE FALLOPIAN TUBE,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
IT'S ONLY 15 CENTIMETERS,
 BUT IT TAKES 3 DAYS.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
DURING THAT TIME, THE
 WOMB ITSELF IS PREPARED.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
THIS IS THE LINING
 OF THE WOMB.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
IT'S PACKED WITH
 NOURISHMENT.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
READY TO FEED A
 FERTILIZED EGG,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
AS IT GROWS INTO A BABY.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
WHEN THE EGG IS NOT
 FERTILIZED LINING AND EGG

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
TOGETHER ARE PAST AWAY
 IN THE BLEEDING OF THE

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
PERIOD.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
THIS AMAZING SEQUENCE OF
 EVENTS TAKES PLACE 400

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
TIMES IN THE LIFE
 OF A NORMAL FEMALE.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
ALMOST ALL WOMEN REMEMBER
 EXACTLY WHEN THEY STARTED

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
THEIR PERIODS.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
BUT NOT MANY KNOW
 WHAT THE TRIGGER WAS.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
THE CRUCIAL
 FACTOR IS WEIGHT.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
VIRTUALLY ALL GIRLS
 ARE ABOUT 48 KILOGRAMS,

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
17 PERCENT FAT
 WHEN THEY START.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY MUST
 BE BIG ENOUGH TO NOURISH A

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
BABY.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
EIGHTY YEARS AGO, WHEN
 MANY GIRLS DID NOT HAVE

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
ENOUGH TO EAT THE AVERAGE
 AGE OF THE FIRST PERIOD

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
WAS SIXTEEN.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
AS NUTRITION IMPROVED,
 THAT AGE DROPPED.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
UNTIL IN THE 1940'S
 IS WAS DOWN TO 13.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
THESE DAYS IN SPITE OF THE
 ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF FOOD

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
PEOPLE EAT, THE AGE AT
 WHICH PERIODS START IS

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
STILL THE SAME.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
THIRTEEN YEARS OLD.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
BUT BREAST DEVELOPMENT
 IS COMING EARLIER.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
THE TIME BETWEEN STARTING
 PUBERTY AND STARTING

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
PERIODS HAS
 DOUBLED IN LENGTH.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
FROM EIGHTEEN MONTHS
 TO THREE YEARS.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
NOW A DAYS, PUBERTY IS
 LASTING LONGER THAN EVER

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.000
BEFORE.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
THE TWINS HAVE
 JUST TURNED 13.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
HOW CLOSE ARE THEY TO
 THE CRUCIAL 48 KILOGRAMS,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
7 ½ STONE.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
HELLO, I'M JUST
ABOUT TO GO DOWNSTAIRS.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
AND I'M ABOUT TO
GET ON THE SCALE.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
TECHNICALLY, I'M NOT
AS BIG AS MY SISTER.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
AND I'M 7 ½ STONE.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
IT LOOKS LIKE THE TWINS
MIGHT START QUIT SOON.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
BUT PERIODS AREN'T
THE END OF PUBERTY.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
THERE THE BEGINNING OF
SOMETHING MUCH WORSE.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
MUSIC

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
BACK AT THE WEB SITE
THEIR PREPARING FOR A

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
FEATURE THAT'S ALWAYS A
HIT WITH TEENAGE GIRLS.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
ESPECIALLY THEIR
BIGGEST CONSUMERS,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
THE 14 YEAR OLDS.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
NICE SMILE.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
THIS IS THE BEFORE SHOT.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
WE DID A FEW
SHOTS THROUGHOUT.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
A SINGLE MINDED
DEVOTION TO THEIR IMAGE IS

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
TYPICAL.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:56.000
WHAT'S YOU RECKON?

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
YEAH, IT'S NICE.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
GIRLS ARE NOT ONLY DRIVEN
BY WHAT'S IN FASHION.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
WITH AN EVER
CHANGING BODY,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
WHAT LOOKED
GOOD LAST MONTH,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
MAYBE ENTIRELY
WRONG TODAY.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
THE CURSE OF BEING 14
IS SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS AND

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
INSECURITY.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
I LIKE THE TOP
AND THE TOP OVER IT.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
I LIKE THE COLORS.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000
I THINK I WOULD
WEAR THE TOP.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
UM, THE SHOES I'M NOT
REALLY SURE ABOUT.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
THE LETTERS THAT COME TO
THE SITES AGONY COLUMN GO

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
TO EDITOR SIMONE NOCKS.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000
WE GET A LOT OF
LETTERS ABOUT DEVELOPMENT,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000
LIKE PERIODS, BREASTS,
WHEN ARE THEY

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
GOING TO HAPPEN?

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
"ALL MY FRIENDS HAVE
BREASTS, WHY DON'T I?

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
"IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000
AM I TERRIBLY BROKEN?"

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
THAT KIND OF THING.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
TEENAGE GIRLS ARE
THE MOST HARSH PEOPLE.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
MOST HARSH SPECIES
ON THE PLANET EARTH.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
I THINK THAT THEY SEE
THEMSELVES IN THE MIRROR

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
AND THEY LOOK
AT THE FLAWS.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
WHEN I LOOK
IN THE MIRROR,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
I THINK AND I SEE NICE
EYES, SPOTTY FACE,

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000
AND A TERRIBLE NOSE.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:01.000
I ABSOLUTELY HATE.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
GIRLS BECOME SO ACUTELY
 AWARE OF HOW THEY LOOK,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
BECAUSE THEIR
 BRAIN IS CHANGING.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
LIKE THE BODY, THE
 BRAIN DEVELOPS DURING

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
ADOLESCENCE.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
AND THAT CHANGES THE
 WAY TEENAGERS THINK.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
THEY BECOME MORE AWARE
 OF THE WORLD AROUND THEM.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
AND THE FACT THAT OTHER
 PEOPLE HAVE A POINT OF

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000
VIEW.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
ADD THAT TO AN
 UNPREDICTABLE BODY AND THE

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000
RESULT CAN BE PAINFUL
 SELF CRITICISM.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
THERE'S A BUMP
RIGHT THERE.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000
I DON'T LIKE MY EYEBROWS.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
BIG CHERRY MOLDING NOSE.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
IT WAS SMALL EARS,
RATHER THAN BIG EARS.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
I HAVE VERY SMALL PORES.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
OF COURSE SOME PROBLEMS
 CANNOT BE AVOIDED.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
I CAN'T REALLY SEE
ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR SPOTS.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
I HAVE TWO BIG
SPOTS, SPOTTY FREAK.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
SPOTTY FREAK.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
A SPOTTY FREAK

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
ALL TEENAGERS
 GET SPOTS.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
THERE NOT CAUSED
 BY STRESS,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
THERE NOT CAUSED
 BY CHOCOLATE.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
AND THEY HAVE LITTLE TO
 DO WITH HOW MUCH YOU WASH.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
SPS ARE CAUSED BY
 ALLERGY AND INFECTION.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
THIS IS SKIN MAGNIFIED
 A 1000 TIMES.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
IT'S COVERED IN HAIR
 FOLLICLES AND INSIDE

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
EVERYONE IS A GLAND THAT
 PRODUCES GREASE CALLED

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
SEBUM.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
A TEENAGERS FACE PRODUCES
 HALF A LITTER OF SEBUM A

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
YEAR.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
IT'S AN ALLERGIC REACTION
 TO THE SURGING HORMONES.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
AS IF THE SKIN IS TRYING
 TO WASH THEM AWAY.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
BUT ON ITS OWN, EVEN SEBUM
 DOES NOT CAUSE SPOTS.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
FOR THAT, YOU
 NEED BACTERIA.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
THEY LIVE ON
 EVERYBODY'S SKIN.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
BUT THEY DO NO DAMAGE
 UNL THEY FIND THEIR WAY

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
INTO A STICKY AIRLESS
 HAIR FOLLICLE.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
AND THERE THEY THRIVE.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000
THE BODY SENDS WHITE CELLS
 TO FIGHT THE BACTERIA OFF

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
AND THE COMBINATION
 OF WHITE CELLS,

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
BACTERIA AND GREASE
 CAUSES THE UNMISTAKABLE

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
INFLAMMATION OF THE SPOT.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
WHERE DID MY BUT GO?

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
OH MY GOD.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000
THIS MIRROR IS SO AWESOME.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
THE GIRLS BIGGEST
 WORRY IS THEIR WEIGHT.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
THE FACT THAT
 SAD, BUT TRUE.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000
THESE GIRLS ARE TYPICAL OF
 TEENAGERS WHO HAVE TAKEN A

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
PART IN DIFFERENT STUDIES.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
SOME OF WHICH USED A
 DISTORTING MIRROR LIKE

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000
THIS.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
THEY CAN MAKE THEIR
 REFLECTIONS LOOK FATTER OR

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
THINNER BY TURNING THE
 KNOB BEHIND THE MIRROR.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
THE CHALLENGE IS TO
 RECOIZE THEIR TRUE AND

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000
DISTORTED SHAPE.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:45.000
I LOOK ANOREXIC.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
BIG.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000
NO THAT'S TO BIG.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
GO BACK DOWN.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
THERE.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000
OH NICE.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
SURISINGLY, THEY
 CAN JUDGE THEIR SIZE

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
QUITE ACCURATELY.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
BUT ILE ONLY 25 PERCENT
 OF TEENAGE GIRLS ARE

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
ACTUALLY OVERWEIGHT, 60
 PERCENT OF TM THINK THEY

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
ARE.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000
I'M FAT.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
LOOK AT ME.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.000
THAT'S NASTY.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
I'M ON A DIET.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
IT'S BECAUSE EVERYONE
SAYS YOU NOT FAT.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:24.000
WHAT SIZE ARE YOU.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000
I'M A SIZE 10.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000
I'M STILL FAT.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
SMILE A BIT FOR ME.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
PERFECT.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
I THINK THE THING THAT
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO IS

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
THE BIG STRESS OF NOT
BEING ATTRACTIVE AND NOT

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
BEING PRETTY TO BOYS
AND NOT BEINATTRACTIVE

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
WIIN THEIR PRS.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
SO REALLY ITS
NOT JUST FAT.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
IT JUST SYMPTOMS OF
NOT FEELING ATTRACTI.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
AS A TEENAGER,
ESPECIALLY AS A GIRL,

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
HOW YOU LOOK IS VERY OFF
LIMIT WITH POPULARITY.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
MUSIC

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
AT THE END OF TWO
YEARS WITH OUR GIRLS,

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
WE SPENT MOST OF THE
BIG CHANGES OF PUBERTY.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
WHAT DIFFERENCE HAVE
THEY MADE TO THEIR LIVES?

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
(MUSIC)

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
WE'VE COME A LONG,
LONG WAY TOGETHER.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
THROUGH THE HARD
TIMES AND THE GOOD.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
I HAVE TO
CELEBRATE YOU BABY.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:29.000
I HAVE TO PRAISE
YOU LIKE I SHOULD.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
REBECCA AND JESSICA
ARE NOW 13 ½ .

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000
TWO YEARS AGO, THEY
STILL HAD IT ALL TO COME.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
THEYRODUCED BREASTS.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
AND PERIODS AND ALL
THAT STUFF, YUCKY STUFF.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.000
MUSIC

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
WE HAVE JUST
GOT OUR PERIOD,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
WHICH WE PROBABLY
HAVE TURNED INTO WOMEN.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
IT MEANS, I'VE
LOST MY CHILDHOOD.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
(LAUGHTER)

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
BACK OFF,
HOLD ON TO NINA.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
I'M REALLY, REALLY
EMBARRASSED.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000
WHERE WAS I...

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
AHH, I'VE GOT A
REALLY BAD BELLY ACHES,

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
I'VE GOT BACKACHES,

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000
I'M ON MY PERIOD,

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
I'VE GOT HEADACHES,

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:17.000
AND I FEEL SICK.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
THERE CAN BE EIGHT YEARS
BETWEEN WHEN ANY TWO GIRLS

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
START THEIR PERIODS.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE TWINS
WITH THEIR IDENTICAL

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000
GENES?

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
WHICH OF THEM
STARTED FIRST?

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
IT WAS JESSICA,
THE YOUNGER ONE.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
BUT REBECCA
WASN'T FAR BEHIND.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000
SHE STARTED THE
VERY NEXT DAY.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000
AND WAS IT AS BAD
AS THEY ALL THOUGHT.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
I THOUGHT AS SOON AS
STARTED MY PERIOD I WOULD

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
BE CHANGED, BUT
I HAVEN'T REALLY.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000
I FEEL THE SAME.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
I THOUGHT I'D GET MORE
MOODY AND LIKING BOYS.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
BUT I HAVEN'T.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
SOMETIMES I,
I FANCY BOYS,

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
BUT BOYS WON'T
LIKE KISSING.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000
IT JUST FREAKS ME OUT THEY
WAY PEOPLE HUGGING EACH

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000
OTHER.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000
IT MAKES ME SICK.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
AND LIKE, DON'T
LISTEN TO ADULTS,

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
AND THEY TALK ABOUT
SECONDARY SCHOOL.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
CAUSE, I THOUGHT IT WAS
GOING TO BE REALLY BAD.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
EVERY WHERE YOU GO IT'S
LIKE SOMETHING LIKE YOUR

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
GONNA GET BULLIED,
BUT YOU REALLY DON'T.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000
NOW WE ARE JUST
NORMAL TEENAGE GIRLS.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
JUST HANGING
AROUND AND LAUGH.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
OVER NOTHING AND STUFF.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000
IT'S GOT ME

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
IT'S GOT ME.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
ALEX, IS STILL TAKING
THE MEDICINE TO STOP HER

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000
DEVELOPMENT.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
SO SHE'S NOT CHANGED MUCH.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
AND HER MOM PLANS
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY,

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
UNTIL SHE'S A LEAST 13.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
AT 14, CLAUDIA IS GOING
THROUGH THE TOUGHEST SET

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
OF EXAMS THAT SHE
HAS EVER FACED.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
TWO YEARS AFTER THE PEEK
OF HER GROWTH SPURT.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000
WILL SHE BE ALRIGHT?

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000
TODAY IT'S JAZZ.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
JAZZ, UM, IT'S ALMOST
LIKE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
I'D JUST BE HAPPY IF I
COME OUT WITH ANYTHING

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000
ABOVE 50.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
ONE, TWO, THREE, AND
FOUR FIVE, SIX, SEVEN,

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000
AND EIGHT.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
I CAME OUT WITH 66 ½ .

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:22.000
MUSIC

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:23.000
TO COME OUT WITH 66.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000
WAS SOMETHING
I WAS REALLY,

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
REALLY PLEASED ABOUT
AND A HALF AND I CAME ON TOP.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000
(MUSIC)

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
THAT WAS SOMETHING
I WAS REALLY, REALLY,

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
REALLY HAPPY ABOUT.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000
CLAUDIA HAS REGAINED HER
BALANCE AND HER BODY IS

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000
UNDER CONTROL.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
WELL, MOST OF IT IS.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000
SEE THAT NICE
BIG KICK YOU DID.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
I ONLY REALIZED THAT
YOU WANTED ME TO START.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
HOW HIGH MY LEG GOT.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
I ACTUALLY SMACKED
MYSELF IN THE FACE.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000
WHICH I ACTUALLY
SHOCKED MYSELF.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
I WAS LIKE "WOW"
YOU CAN DO THAT!

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
YOU HAVE THE
FLEXIBILITY.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000
REMEMBER WHEN WE
FIRST MET SHARMAINE.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
SHE WAS 14.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
SHE HAS NO CONSIDERATION
FOR OTHERS WHATSOEVER.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000
I'M NOT PERFECT.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
NOW SHARMAINE IS 16
AND SHE IS A REFORMED

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000
CHARACTER.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
SHE'S A COMPLETE
DIFFERENT CHILD FROM WHAT

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000
SHE WAS.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000
SHE HAS REALLY,
REALLY CHANGED.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
IF I'M IN MY BEDROOM,
SHE'LL COME IN AND SIT ON

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
THE BED AND WE
WILL HAVE A LAUGH.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000
SHE TELLS ME QUITE A LOT.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
WE TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000
AND I'M GLAD THAT SHE
CAN CONFIDE IN ME NOW.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
BECAUSE I CAN OFFER
HER ME OPINION.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000
WE MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY
AGREE BUT WE WILL SIT DOWN

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000
AND TALK ABOUT IT.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000
I RESPECT HER MORE NOW.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000
AND I THINK SHRESPECTS
MY OPINIONS AS WELL MORE

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
THAN SHE USE TO AND IT'S
JUST GETTING BETTER.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:56.000
YES.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000
YES.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000
I BEAT YA.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000
I BEAT YA, SO WHAT
ARE YOU GOING TO SAY.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
BEFORE IT WAS FUN TO
ANALYZE AND GET HER BACK.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
BUT NOW I'LL JUST LEAVE
HER AND IF YOU DON'T

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
ANSWER BACK THE ARGUMENT
FINISHES QUICKER.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
STEPHANIE, YOUR NEXT.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN
PEACE HAS BROKEN OUT IN

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
SHARMAINE'S HOUSEHOLD.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
RECENTLY, LITTLE
SISTER STEPH TURNED 13.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000
HER ATTITUDE STINKS..

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000
SHARMAINE HAS IMPROVED
AND STEPHANIE HAS GONE THE

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
OPPOSITE WAY.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
I'VE JUST GOT A
BAD ATTITUDE PROBLEM.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
HOLD ON.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000
SHE'S SO CHEEKY
TO PEOPLE.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000
WHO DOES SHE REMIND
YOU OF, ARMAINE?

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
STEPHANIE'S NAUGHTY.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
WHEN I HEAR STEPH, IT'S
LIKE HEARING MYSELF FROM

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000
STEPH'S A LITTLE ME NOW.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000
NAUGHTY.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
LAUGHTER

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000
MUSIC

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000
OH, NO!
