00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
IT'S EASY TO KNOW WHAT YOU
DON'T WANT IN A CAREER.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I DON'T WANT TO
 WORK FOR A COMPANY

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
THAT I DON'T
 BELIEVE IN.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
WORKING IN AN OFFICE,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
CRUNCHING
 MEANINGLESS DATA.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
CLOCKING IN, SITTING
 IN A LITTLE CUBICLE.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
BUT FIGURING OUT WHAT YOU
DO WANT CAN BE HARDER.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'D LIKE SOMETHING WHERE
 I COULD TRAVEL A LOT.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
A CAREER THAT HELPS
 PEOPLE BUT MAKES ENOUGH

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
FOR ME TO LIVE
 COMFORTABLY.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I WANT TO
 BE SIGNIFICANT,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
AND I WANT TO
 MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
WHAT YOU MAY
BE LOOKING FOR

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
IS A CAREER IN SCIENCE.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:12.000
*

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
*

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
WHY WOULD ANYONE FLY
INTO THE EYE OF A STORM?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
CAN YOU ACTUALLY
LIVE AT THE BASE

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
OF AN ACTIVE VOLCANO?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
WHAT DID NEW YORK CITY
LOOK LIKE 400 YEARS AGO?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
DOES AIR POLLUTION
LOWER YOUR IQ?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
BY STRIVING TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS LIKE THESE,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
EARTH SCIENTISTS
HELP US UNDERSTAND

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
HOW OUR PLANET WORKS.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
BUILDING ON A FOUNDATION
OF GEOLOGY, MATH,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY,
THE EARTH SCIENCES

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
EXPLORE THE MAKE-UP AND
BEHAVIOR OF THE EARTH'S

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
MAIN ELEMENTS - THE
LAND, WATER AND AIR -

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
AND HOW THEY INTERACT
WITH EACH OTHER.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
WITH A DEEPER
UNDERSTANDING

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
OF THE PLANET, SCIENTISTS
CAN MAKE PREDICTIONS

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
ABOUT HOW THE
EARTH WILL BEHAVE;

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
PREDICTIONS THAT CAN
SAVE LIVES AND CONSERVE

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
VALUABLE RESOURCES
FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
AFTER PREPARING A HOT
CUP OF TEA, MAYA TOLSTOY

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
IS READY TO PROBE THE
DEPTHS OF THE OCEAN.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
SITTING AT HER COMPUTER
IS THE ONLY WAY FOR HER

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
TO STUDY UNDERWATER
VOLCANOES AND EARTHQUAKES.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
NOBODY'S EVER SEEN THOSE
EARTHQUAKES BEFORE,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT PROCESSES
ARE HAPPENING THERE,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
DEEP IN THE OCEAN.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE VERY
OFTEN AT THE DESK,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
IT'S LIKE EXPLORATION.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
WITH TWO-THIRDS OF THE
PLANET COVERED BY WATER,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
MARINE SEISMOLOGISTS HAVE
A LOT OF AREA TO COVER

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
WHILE STUDYING AND
MONITORING THE UNDERWATER

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
EARTHQUAKES
AND VOLCANOES

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
THAT SHAPE OUR
EARTH'S CRUST.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
LEARNING MORE ABOUT THESE
POWERFUL EVENTS COULD LEAD

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
TO BETTER WARNINGS ABOUT
THEIR POTENTIAL EFFECTS

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
ON LAND - LIKE THE
DEVASTATION CAUSED BY

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
THE 2004
TSUNAMI IN ASIA.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
MAYA IS ONE OF THE
SCIENTISTS WHO STUDIED

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
THE EARTHQUAKE THAT
CAUSED THE TSUNAMI.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
SHE DISCOVERED HOW LARGE
THE QUAKE ACTUALLY WAS

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
BY ANALYZING THE SOUND WAVES
IT RELEASED INTO THE OCEAN.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
IT'S A VERY EERIE
SOUND, OBVIOUSLY.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
IT DEFINITELY SENDS
SHIVERS DOWN YOUR SPINE.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
IT'S THE SOUND OF THE EARTH
RIPPING APART FOR THAT LONG.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
IT WENT A DISTANCE
BASICALLY THE LENGTH

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
OF CALIFORNIA, 750 MILES,
IN EIGHT MINUTES.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
BUT MAYA'S WORK ALSO
REQUIRES HER TO DO

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
PLENTY OF ACTUAL EXPLORING
- LIKE SAILING INTO

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
THE OPEN OCEAN TO DEPLOY
INSTRUMENTS THAT MONITOR

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
THE EARTH'S MOVEMENT
AND RECORD THE SOUND

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
OF THE UNDERWATER
EVENTS SHE STUDIES.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
THE FIRST CRUISE I WENT ON
WAS A 10-DAY CRUISE

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
WHEN I WAS AN UNDERGRADUATE,
AND IT WAS JUST MAGICAL.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
BEING FAR AWAY FROM LAND
AND THE SMELL OF THE OCEAN,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
THERE'S A REALLY NICE
TEAM SPIRIT THAT DEVELOPS,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
IT'S A GREAT ADVENTURE;
IT'S VERY EXCITING.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
MAYA STILL GOES ON CRUISES
AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
THOUGH AS A SENIOR SCIENTIST
SHE HAS THE OPTION

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
OF SENDING OTHERS
IN HER PLACE

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
WHICH GIVES HER
MORE TIME AT HOME

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
WITH HER SON, JASON.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
IT'S A LUXURY SHE'S EARNED
THROUGH HARD WORK,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
BUT IT WASN'T
ALWAYS EASY.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
MAYA RECALLS ONE
PARTICULAR RUN-IN

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
WITH HER SENIOR-YEAR
SCIENCE TEACHER.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
HE HEARD ONE DAY THAT
I'D APPLIED FOR COLLEGE

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
TO DO PHYSICS, AND
HE SCREAMED AT ME

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE
CLASS, AND HE SAID,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
"YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE
IT PAST YOUR FIRST YEAR,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
YOUR MOMMY'S NOT
GONNA BE THERE,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
GIRLS DON'T
DO PHYSICS!"

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
JUST TOTALLY
HUMILIATED ME

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
IN FRONT OF
THE WHOLE CLASS.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
BUT I WENT ANYWAY.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
GETTING THROUGH THE ROAD
BLOCKS HAS BEEN WORTH IT.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
MAYA IS NOW A TOP
SCIENTIST IN HER FIELD

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
AND SHE EVEN FINDS TIME TO
PURSUE HER OTHER PASSION:

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
ACTING.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I'M STILL IN THE SCREEN
ACTORS GUILD, SO I PAY

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
MY MEMBERSHIP CAUSE
I'M NOT GIVING THAT UP.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I ALSO DID A DOCUMENTARY
WITH JAMES CAMERON CALLED

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
ALIENS OF THE DEEP , AND
SO THAT WAS REALLY FUN.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
IN FACT, SHE SAYS
THE TWO CAREERS

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
AREN'T ALL
THAT DIFFERENT.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY
LIKED ABOUT ACTING WAS THE

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
TEAMWORK THAT GOES INTO
MAKING A PRODUCTION.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
AND THAT'S ONE
OF THE THINGS

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I REALLY ENJOY
ABOUT SCIENCE

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
AND ABOUT DOING THE
BIG SEA-GOING PROJECTS.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
HER WORK BACK ON LAND -
ANALYZING PATTERNS

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
IN THE DATA FROM HER
SEA INSTRUMENTS -

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
CAN BE MORE LIKE TRYING
TO SOLVE A PUZZLE.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
HER BACKGROUND
IN SCIENCE

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
HAS EQUIPPED HER
FOR THIS CHALLENGE,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
AND ALSO PREPARED
HER FOR SO MUCH MORE.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
SCIENCE TEACHES YOU IS

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
CRITICAL THINKING AND
LOGICAL THINKING AND

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I THINK THAT THAT'S JUST
SUCH A VALUABLE SKILL

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
IN ANY ASPECT OF LIFE,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
WHETHER YOU'RE LISTENING
TO AN AD FOR A CAR

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
OR WHETHER YOU'RE
LISTENING TO POLITICIANS,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
IT'S ALWAYS
VALUABLE TO HAVE

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
GOOD CRITICAL
THINKING SKILLS.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
MARINE SEISMOLOGISTS
SPEND A LOT OF TIME

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
OUT ON THE OCEAN AND
NEED A STRONG BACKGROUND

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
IN PHYSICS AND GEOLOGY.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
RESEARCH AREAS INCLUDE
STUDYING TSUNAMIS

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
AND THE MOVEMENT OF
THE EARTH'S CRUST.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
COMMERCIALLY,
MARINE SEISMOLOGISTS

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
CAN WORK IN THE
PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
RECENT GRADUATES CAN
EXPECT STARTING SALARIES

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
OF $36,000 A YEAR.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
THE MEDIAN SALARY
FOR ALL SEISMOLOGISTS

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
IS OVER $67,000 A YEAR.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
MOST PEOPLE HEAD FOR
SAFETY WHEN A HURRICANE

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
IS HEADED FOR LANDFALL,
BUT NOT STAN GOLDENBERG.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
HE GETS INTO A PLANE
AND FLIES RIGHT INTO

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
THE EYE OF THE STORM.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
STAN IS A
METEOROLOGIST

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
WITH THE HURRICANE
RESEARCH DIVISION

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
OF THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT'S NATIONAL

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC
ADMINISTRATION, OR NOAA.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
AS ONE OF THEIR
"HURRICANE HUNTERS",

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
IT'S HIS JOB TO GO ON
RECONNAISANCE FLIGHTS

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
BEFORE AND DURING
HURRICANES.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
IN NOAA'S SPECIALLY
EQUIPPED PLANES,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
HE CAPTURES DATA THAT HELPS
ESTIMATE THE SIZE,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
SPEED AND LIKELY
PATH OF THE STORM -

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
INFORMATION THAT'S
CRITICAL TO ASSESSING

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
THE NEED FOR WARNINGS
AND EVACUATIONS.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I'VE FLOWN THROUGH
THE EYE OF STORMS

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
OVER A HUNDRED
TIMES BEFORE THAT,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
BUT IT'S NOTHING
IN THE AIR

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
LIKE IT IS
ON THE GROUND.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
AND STAN WOULD KNOW.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
IN 1992 HE AND HIS FAMILY
ENDURED THE FURY

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
OF HURRICANE ANDREW.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
THE ROOF LIFTED OFF,
 AND AS YOU CAN SEE,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
WE HAVE NO HOUSE.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
THANKING GOD, THANKING
 GOD THAT WERE ALL SAFE.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
HALLELUJAH.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
AS ANDREW APPROACHED,
STAN'S WIFE GAVE BIRTH

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
TO THEIR DAUGHTER PEARL.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
KNOWING THAT WIFE AND
BABY WOULD BE SAFE IN THE

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
HOSPITAL, STAN HEADED
TO THEIR MIAMI HOME

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
TO RIDE OUT THE STORM
WITH THEIR THREE SONS.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
IT WAS A NIGHT THEY
ALMOST DIDN'T SURVIVE.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
GOING THROUGH THAT
TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
GIVES ME A LOT MORE
COMPASSION FOR OTHER

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
PEOPLE WHO MIGHT GO
THROUGH THESE THINGS

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
IN THE CARIBBEAN AND
OTHER PARTS OF THE U.S.,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
AND I URGE PEOPLE:

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
THEY MUST TAKE
HURRICANES SERIOUSLY.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
SINCE THEN STAN HAS BECOME
A LEADING ADVOCATE

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
FOR HURRICANE
PREPAREDNESS,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
GIVING PUBLIC TALKS
ON WHAT TO DO.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
ON THE RESEARCH SIDE, HE
SPECIALIZES IN FORECASTING

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
LONG-RANGE HURRICANE
ACTIVITY IN THE ATLANTIC.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
IN 2001, STAN CO-AUTHORED
A LANDMARK SCIENTIFIC PAPER

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
PREDICTING THAT THE
NUMBER OF HURRICANES

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
MAKING LANDFALL
IN THE U.S.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
WOULD INCREASE
DRAMATICALLY.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
BY ANALYZING
WEATHER PATTERNS

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
AND CORRELATING THOSE
TO HURRICANE ACTIVITY,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
STAN PREDICTED THE U.S.
WAS ENTERING A NATURAL

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
CYCLE OF INTENSIFIED
HURRICANE ACTIVITY.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I SAID, MAYBE THIS ISN'T
JUST A LITTLE SPIKE,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
MAYBE THIS IS
A LONG-TERM TREND.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
THE NEXT SEVERAL HURRICANE
SEASONS SEEMED TO CONFIRM

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
HIS FINDINGS, WITH
POWERFUL STORMS LIKE

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
DENNIS, RITA, WILMA
AND, OF COURSE, KATRINA.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
NO FORECAST - SEASONAL
FORECAST OR LONG-TERM

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
FORECAST LIKE THIS - CAN
TELL ANY REGION WITH ANY

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
CERTAINTY THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO GET HIT ANY TIME

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
IN THE NEXT TWO OR
THREE YEARS OR SOMETHING.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
BUT IT CERTAINLY SAYS
THERE'S MORE OF A

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
PROBABILITY OF IT - THERE'S
MORE ARROWS OUT THERE.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
STAN'S CAREER IS PROOF
THAT IT'S NEVER TOO LATE

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
HE DROPPED OUT
OF JUNIOR COLLEGE

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
TO HITCHHIKE
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
BUT HIS EXPERIENCES
CONVINCED HIM

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
TO RETURN HOME
AND TRY AGAIN.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
HE ENDED UP IN A
METEOROLOGY PROGRAM

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
AND JOINED NOAA AFTER
COMPLETING HIS MASTER'S.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
GIVEN THE DISASTER THAT
CAN STRIKE WHEN PEOPLE

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
FAIL TO EVACUATE,
IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
STAN'S HURRICANE HUNTER
FLIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
BUT IT'S ALSO
IMPORTANT TO FIGURE OUT

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
WHEN NOT TO EVACUATE.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
MOST PEOPLE DON'T
KNOW IT COSTS

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
ABOUT ONE MILLION
DOLLARS PER COASTLINE

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
OF POPULATED
AREA TO EVACUATE.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
SO IF WE CAN REDUCE THE
WARNING AREA BY JUST

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
ONE MILE, AS FAR AS
THE AREA EVACUATED,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
WE'VE PAID FOR OUR PROGRAM
FOR THE WHOLE YEAR.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
AND ASIDE FROM GATHERING
SUCH CRITICAL DATA,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
FLYING INTO THE EYE
OF A HURRICANE

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
HAS OTHER REWARDS.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
IT'S SPECTACULAR BEAUTY.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
AWESOME BEAUTY
FROM SEA TO SKY.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
TALK ABOUT A 10-MILE-HIGH
WALL OF CLOUDS

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
CIRCLING AROUND YOU,
BUT CLEAR AT THE TOP,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
CALM OCEAN
AT THE BOTTOM,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
AND PEOPLE'S MOUTHS
USUALLY DROP OPEN

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
EVEN IF YOU'VE BEEN IN
THERE AGAIN AND AGAIN.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
METEOROLOGISTS NEED
A FOUNDATION IN MATH

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
AND PHYSICS, SOME KNOWLEDGE
OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
AND IN SOME CASES, AN
UNDERSTANDING OF CHEMISTRY.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
TELEVISION WEATHER
FORECASTERS MAY GET

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
ALL THE GLORY, BUT
THOSE GIGS ARE RARE.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
MOST JOBS ARE WITHIN
FEDERAL AGENCIES, AND

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
THERE ARE ALSO
METEOROLOGY JOBS IN THE

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
OIL, AERONAUTICS AND
INSURANCE INDUSTRIES.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
IN FEDERAL AGENCIES,
ENTRY-LEVEL PAY FOR

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
COLLEGE GRADUATES IS
ABOUT $28,000 A YEAR.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
THE MEDIAN ANNUAL SALARY
FOR ALL METEOROLOGISTS

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
IS ABOUT $70,000.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
HE MAY BE SAFE AND
SOUND IN HIS LAB TODAY,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
BUT EARLY IN HIS CAREER
WHILE DOING RESEARCH

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
AT MOUNT
ETNA IN ITALY,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
VOLCANOLOGIST
JAKE LOWENSTERN

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
LEARNED A
VALUABLE LESSON:

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
CHECK THE DAILY
SEISMIC RECORDS

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
BEFORE YOU HEAD UP THE
SIDE OF AN ACTIVE VOLCANO.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
JAKE AND HIS GUIDE
WERE PREPARING

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
TO TAKE SAMPLES
OF NEW LAVA FLOW

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
WHEN THE SITUATION
SUDDENLY TURNED DANGEROUS.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
THEY HAD TO BEAT A HASTY
RETREAT IN THE DARK

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
ACROSS A WEEK-OLD
MOLTEN LAVA FLOW.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
HAD WE KNOWN MORE, WE
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
AND WE WERE DODGING BOMBS
OF LAVA THAT WERE SHOOTING

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
INTO THE SKY AND
FALLING ALL AROUND US.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
IT WAS A TRULY
TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
- NOT ONE THAT I HOPE
TO EVER HAVE AGAIN,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
BUT ONE FROM WHICH
I LEARNED A LOT.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
BUT HANDS-ON WORK IN THE
FIELD IS JUST WHAT JAKE

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
WAS LOOKING FOR WHEN HE
CHOSE GEOLOGY AS A CAREER.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
TODAY, JAKE READS
SEISMIC RECORDS

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
LIKE MOST OF US READ
THE LOCAL PAPER.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
AS A RESEARCH
GEOLOGIST AT THE U.S.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND THE
SCIENTIST-IN-CHARGE OF THE

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
YELLOWSTONE VOLCANO
OBSERVATORY, HE HEADS UP A

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
TEAM OF SCIENTISTS AND
RESEARCHERS THAT MONITORS

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
VOLCANIC ACTIVITY IN
THE NATIONAL PARK.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
YELLOWSTONE IS HOME TO
ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
MOST ACTIVE CALDERAS: A
VOLCANO THAT HAS COLLAPSED

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
INTO THE GROUND.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I GET TO WALK AROUND
THE VOLCANOES,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I STUDY THE GASES THAT
COME OUT OF THE GROUND,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
AND I GET TO WORK ON HOT
SPRINGS AND WATCH MAGMA

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
AND LAVA COMING OUT OF
THE GROUND, AND IT'S

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
A PRETTY TREMENDOUS
THING TO GET TO DO.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
AFTER GRADUATING FROM
COLLEGE WITH A BACHELOR'S

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
DEGREE IN GEOLOGY, JAKE
SPENT A YEAR IN SICILY

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
DOING RESEARCH AT MOUNT
ETNA, ONE OF THE WORLD'S

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
MOST FAMOUS
ACTIVE VOLCANOES.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
IT WAS A GREAT YEAR FOR
ME PERSONALLY AND AS A

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
SCIENTIST LEARNING WHAT
HAPPENS ON A BIG VOLCANO

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
THAT'S SURROUNDED
BY CITIES.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
MUCH OF JAKE'S RESEARCH
TODAY IS INFLUENCED

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
BY THAT EXPERIENCE.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
WHILE MANY VOLCANOLOGISTS
CONCENTRATE ON MAPPING

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
VOLCANOS AND RESEARCHING
THEIR HISTORY,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
JAKE FOCUSES ON MONITORING
VOLCANIC ACTIVITY.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
HE COLLECTS AND MEASURES
GASES EMANATING

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
FROM VOLCANIC AREAS,
AND USES THE DATA

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
TO FORECAST
POTENTIAL ERUPTIONS.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
WHILE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO
PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
WHAT VOLCANOES
WILL DO,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
THEY DO OFFER CLUES DAYS,
WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
BEFORE MAGMA ACTUALLY
MAKES IT TO THE SURFACE.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
GENERALLY BEFORE ANY KIND
OF VOLCANIC ERUPTION OCCURS

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
THE VOLCANO SENDS OUT
SIGNALS THAT WE CAN READ

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
TO KNOW THAT
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
THAT SOMETHING
NEEDS CLOSER WATCHING.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
AND SO THOSE ARE THE SORTS
OF THINGS THAT WE DO

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
AS VOLCANO
OBSERVATORIES

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
TO PREPARE FOR
COMING ERUPTIONS.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
AN AVID WRITER, JAKE
HAS ALSO SERVED AS

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
A CONSULTANT ON SEVERAL
DOCUMENTARIES AND FILMS.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
HE TRAVELS ABOUT TWO
MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
EXPLORING THE
YELLOWSTONE CALDERA

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
AND VISITING VOLCANOES
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
A RECENT TRIP TOOK HIM TO
ITALY'S PHLEGRAEN FIELDS,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
WHERE HE WAS AMAZED BY
HOW AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
EXISTS WITHIN THE
VOLCANIC SYSTEM.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
I'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I'VE BEEN TO SOME OF THE
HIGHEST PLACES ON EARTH

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
AND SOME OF THE
DEEPEST VALLEYS

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
AND SOME OF THE
RICHEST COUNTRIES

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
AND SOME OF THE POOREST
PLACES ON EARTH.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I'VE JUST BEEN ABLE TO
SEE A LOT AND LEARN A LOT

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS HERE
AND IN OTHER PLACES

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
BESIDES WHERE I LIVE, SO
IT'S ALWAYS AN EDUCATION;

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
IT'S SOMETHING
THAT I LOVE TO DO.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
BUT EVEN WITH ALL THE
TRAVEL, FIELD WORK

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
AND HANDS-ON EXPERIENCES,
JAKE'S GREATEST SATISFACTION

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
COMES FROM SHARING THE
RESULTS OF HIS RESEARCH -

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
WRITING CLEAR, CONCISE PAPERS
THAT ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
OF VOLCANOES AND THEIR
EFFECT ON THE EARTH.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE;
IT'S OUR HOME.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
AND IF WE DON'T
UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A
TOUGH TIME LIVING HERE

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
AND SURVIVING HERE ON THIS
PLANET IN THE LONG RUN.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
THE STUDY OF VOLCANOS
REQUIRES SPATIAL ANALYSIS

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
AND VISUAL MEMORY SKILLS.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
A SOLID FOUNDATION IN
GEOLOGY AND MATH IS ESSENTIAL.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
VOLCANOLOGY IS A
SPECIALIZED FIELD

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
WITH MOST JOBS IN
ACADEMIA OR GOVERNMENT.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
OPTIONS FOR OTHER TYPES OF
GEOLOGISTS INCLUDE URBAN

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
PLANNING, OIL EXPLORATION,
MINING AND MORE.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
THE MEDIAN ANNUAL SALARY
FOR ALL GEOSCIENTISTS

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
IS AROUND $69,000.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT
GEOLOGISTS AVERAGE OVER

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
$83,000 A YEAR.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
CARS, FACTORIES,
POWER PLANTS -

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
SOURCES OF POLLUTION
ARE EVERYWHERE.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
BUT HOW MUCH DO POLLUTANTS
ACTUALLY AFFECT OUR HEALTH?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
ENVIRONMENTAL
HEALTH SCIENTISTS

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
LIKE FREDERICA PERERA
ANSWER THAT QUESTION

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
BY DISCOVERING
THE CONNECTIONS

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
BETWEEN TOXINS
AND DISEASE.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
COMMON URBAN POLLUTANTS

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
FROM COMBUSTION SOURCES,
CARS, BUSES, TRUCKS,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
THE BURNING OF ORGANIC
MATERIAL FOR POWER,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
FOR HEAT, SO, WE GENERATE
A LOT OF THESE POLLUTANTS

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
LOCALLY RIGHT HERE
OUT ON OUR STREETS.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
THOUGH SHE'S AN EXPERT
IN HER FIELD NOW,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
FREDERICA DIDN'T
ALWAYS PLAN ON

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
GOING INTO
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
AFTER GRADUATING
FROM COLLEGE

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
WITH A LIBERAL
ARTS DEGREE,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
FREDERICA TOOK TIME
TO RAISE A FAMILY.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
WHILE CONSIDERING
GRADUATE SCHOOL,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
A PHOTO EXHIBIT
SHE SAW IN NEW YORK

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
CHANGED THE
COURSE OF HER LIFE.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
IT SHOWED THESE
PHOTOGRAPHS OF CHILDREN

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
WHO HAD BEEN
HARMED BECAUSE

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
THEIR MOTHERS ATE FISH
FROM THE POLLUTED BAY.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
I WAS VERY STRUCK BY THIS
AND BEGAN THINKING ABOUT

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
HOW VERY SENSITIVE THIS
STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT IS

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
AND THAT CONCERNED ME
BECAUSE AT THE TIME

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
I ACTUALLY HAD YOUNG
CHILDREN MYSELF.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
IN A DRAMATIC SHIFT,
FREDERICA DECIDED TO

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
BECOME A RESEARCH
SCIENTIST, FOCUSED

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
MAINLY ON THE EFFECTS
OF AIRBORNE POLLUTANTS.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
AS A PHD STUDENT SHE
PIONEERED THE USE OF

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
NEW METHODS FOR MEASURING
THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
CERTAIN
TOXIC POLLUTANTS

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
ACTUALLY CAUSE
TO OUR DNA.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
HER FINDINGS MIGHT LEAD
TO BROAD IMPROVEMENTS

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
IN PUBLIC POLICY.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I BEGAN TO SEE THAT WE
COULD DETECT THIS KIND OF

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
DAMAGE IN PEOPLE WHO
WERE PERFECTLY HEALTHY

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
AND WEREN'T JUST
CASES WITH DISEASE.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
AND THIS DAMAGE WAS
A CHANGE IN DNA,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
AN ACTUAL ALTERATION IN
THE GENETIC MATERIAL

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
AS A RESULT OF THIS
POLLUTANT EXPOSURE.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
SHE DISCOVERED THAT
TOXINS CAN EVEN AFFECT

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
AN UNBORN FETUS.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
THIS LED FREDERICA TO LAUNCH
INTERNATIONAL STUDIES

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
INVOLVING THOUSANDS
OF MOTHERS AND CHILDREN

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
TO TRACK THE IMPACT
OF THIS EXPOSURE.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
THE CHILDREN WHO HAD MORE
EXPOSURE IN THE WOMB

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
TO THESE COMBUSTION-RELATED
AIR POLLUTANTS

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY
LOWER ON THE TESTS

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
FOR MENTAL DEVELOPMENT

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
AND WERE MORE THAN TWICE,
ALMOST THREE TIMES

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
AS LIKELY TO BE
DEVELOPMENTALLY DELAYED.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
FREDERICA CONTINUES TO
TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
TO MEET WITH HER
INTERNATIONAL COLLEAGUES.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
AS A TENURED PROFESSOR,
SHE ALSO SPENDS A LOT

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
OF TIME APPLYING FOR
FUNDING, AND SHE TEACHES.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
BUT FOR FREDERICA, THE
MOST SATISFYING THING

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
ABOUT HER WORK IS
THE REAL IMPACT

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
IT CAN HAVE ON
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
WE DON'T JUST PUBLISH
OUR RESULTS AND SAY

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
THAT'S AN
IMPORTANT FINDING,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
BUT WE REACH OUT TO
THE PARTICIPANTS

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
IN THE STUDY AND THE
FAMILIES TO TELL THEM

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
WHAT THEY CAN DO TO
PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
AND SHE HOPES THAT
HER WORK WILL CAUSE

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
LASTING CHANGES IN
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
THERE ARE WAYS TO CURB
AND SHARPLY REDUCE

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
THESE POLLUTANTS
SINCE THEY ARE

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
EMITTED FROM BURNING
OF FOSSIL FUELS.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
WE CAN HAVE MUCH
MORE EFFICIENT

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
WE CAN HAVE CLEANER CARS
AND TRUCKS AND BUSES.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
FOR EXAMPLE, WE
CAN USE HYBRIDS

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
AND CLEAN
AIR TECHNOLOGY.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
AND NOT ONLY DOES SHE
HAVE THE POTENTIAL

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
TO TOUCH THE LIVES OF
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
SHE ALSO LOVES HER JOB.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
SCIENCE IS LIKE...

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
IT'S DETECTIVE WORK.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
AND IT IS INTELLECTUALLY
VERY, VERY EXCITING.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
BUT WORKING WITH
COMMITTED PEOPLE

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
HAS BEEN ANOTHER JOY -
COMMITTED AND SMART PEOPLE

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
WHO CARE ABOUT
FINDING THE ANSWERS

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
TO HOW WE CAN BETTER
PREVENT DISEASE.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
THAT'S BEEN A WONDERFUL
ODYSSEY FOR ME.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
SCIENTISTS NEED TO BE

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
GOOD AT COMMUNICATING,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
WORKING WITH DIVERSE
GROUPS OF PEOPLE,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
AND MAKING ABSTRACT
CONNECTIONS.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
RESEARCHERS IN THIS
FIELD PICK SPECIALTIES

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
LIKE HAZARDOUS WASTE, FOOD
PROTECTION, WATER QUALITY,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
OR RADIATION,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
AND OFTEN WORK CLOSELY
WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
THE MEDIAN SALARY FOR ALL
ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTISTS

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
IS OVER $53,000
WITH A RANGE FROM

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
THE LOW $30'S TO
THE HIGH $80'S.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
ERIC SANDERSON LOOKS
AROUND MANHATTAN

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
AND SEES MORE THAN
JUST THE MADDING CROWD

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
AMONG THE SKYSCRAPERS.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
A LANDSCAPE ECOLOGIST WITH
THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
SOCIETY, ERIC SEES
BLACK BEARS, COUGARS,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
AND BEAVERS ROVING
AMONG STREAMS, WETLANDS

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
AND ROLLING HILLS.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
WHAT ERIC SEES IS NOT
MANHATTAN, BUT MANNAHATTA

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
- THE ISLAND'S ORIGINAL
NATIVE AMERICAN NAME.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
BY TAKING DATA FROM
HISTORICAL MAPS,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
LAND SURVEYS AND
CORRESPONDENCE

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
AND ENTERING IT
INTO GEOGRAPHIC

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
INFORMATION SYSTEMS,
HE DEVELOPED A MODEL

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
OF WHAT "THE CITY THAT
NEVER SLEEPS" LOOKED LIKE

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
WHEN IT WAS A
LUSH WILDERNESS

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
INSTEAD OF A
CONCRETE JUNGLE.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
BY RELATING THE
PLACES WE KNOW TODAY

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
- WHAT'S AT 59TH STREET
AND FIFTH AVENUE TODAY -

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
TO WHAT IT WAS 400
YEARS AGO, WE START TO

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
UNDERSTAND WHY WILDNESS
IS IMPORTANT TO US.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
PEOPLE REALLY
GET INTO IT

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
BECAUSE IT'S THEIR
OWN BACKYARD.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
PEOPLE SEE A STREAM THAT
GOES DOWN FIFTH AVENUE

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
AND IT SO
BLOWS THEIR MIND -

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
HOW DO YOU RECONCILE
THOSE TWO THINGS?

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
ERIC'S "MANNAHATTA
PROJECT" IS DRIVEN BY

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
HIS OVERARCHING GOAL
OF CONSERVATION.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
AS A LANDSCAPE ECOLOGIST,
HE STUDIES HOW ECOSYSTEMS

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
INTERACT ON
A BROAD SCALE

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
AND HOW HUMAN POPULATIONS
IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
MOST OF MY WORK AT THE
WILDLIFE CONSERVATION

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
SOCIETY IS ABOUT SAVING
WILDLIFE IN WILD PLACES

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
WE TRY AND HELP
LOCAL COMMUNITIES

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS
TO LIVE WITH WILDLIFE

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
AND FIND SOLUTIONS FOR
THEM TO LIVE WITH WILDLIFE.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
ONE OF HIS PROJECTS MAPPED
THE HUMAN FOOTPRINT

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
ON A GLOBAL SCALE.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
ERIC COMBINED INFORMATION
LIKE POPULATION DENSITY,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
ROADS, LAND USE, AND
LIGHTS VISIBLE FROM A

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
SATELLITE AT NIGHT, AND
WAS ABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
HUMANS INFLUENCE 83% OF
THE EARTH'S LAND SURFACE.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
WHEN HE CONFINED THE
MAP TO AREAS SUITABLE

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
FOR FARMING, THE
NUMBER GREW TO 98%.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
THE TOUGH PART IS
WHAT TO DO NEXT.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
STATISTICS LIKE THAT
FUEL ERIC'S INTEREST

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
IN CONSERVATION,
BUT CAN ALSO

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
MAKE HIM THE
BEARER OF BAD NEWS.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
SCIENTISTS OFTEN SAY HARD
THINGS AND MEAN THINGS

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
AND THINGS THAT
ARE HARD TO HEAR

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO THE ENVIRONMENT,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
AND WHAT I WANT
PEOPLE TO DO

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
IS UNDERSTAND WHY
WE CARE SO MUCH.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
ERIC ATTRIBUTES HIS
PASSION TO CHILDHOOD

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
SUMMERS SPENT AT HIS
GRANDMOTHER'S CABIN

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
DEEP IN THE
COLORADO WILDERNESS,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
WHERE HE AND HIS COUSINS
ROAMED FREE IN THE WOODS.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
HE WAS ALSO INSPIRED BY A
222-MILE BACKPACKING TRIP

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
HE TOOK WITH FRIENDS IN
HIS NATIVE CALIFORNIA.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
TO THIS DAY HE
RECALLS THIS AS BEING

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
THE FIRST TIME HE EVER
FELT SELF-SUFFICIENT

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
AND TRULY CONTENT.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
BUT ERIC STUDIED
BIOCHEMISTRY

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
AND FIRST WENT TO WORK
FOR A CHEMICAL COMPANY.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
AFTER A FEW YEARS HE
RECALLED HIS FATHER'S REGRET

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
AT GIVING UP ON HIS FORESTRY
CAREER TO GO INTO BUSINESS.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
ERIC CHANGED HIS FOCUS, GOT
A PHD IN LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
AND JOINED
THE WCS IN 1998.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
OUR LIVES ARE SO BUSY
AND SO FULL WITH THINGS

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
THAT WE FORGET HOW
IMPORTANT NATURE IS TO US.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
HIS WORK WITH THE WCS
OFTEN INCLUDES TRAVELING

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
TO EXOTIC LOCATIONS - LIKE
MONGOLIA AND TANZANIA.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
BACK IN NEW YORK, A
TYPICAL DAY COULD INCLUDE

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
WORKING ON BISON RECOVERY,
RESEARCHING THE WILDLIFE

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
POPULATION ON THE
COAST OF PATAGONIA,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
AND UPDATING THE
MANNAHATTA PROJECT.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
WE HOPE TO HAVE A THOUSAND
TO TWO THOUSAND LAYERS

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
- ONE FOR EVERY SPECIES -

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
EVERY VERTEBRATE SPECIES
THAT LIVED ON MANHATTAN.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
BY SHOWING HOW MUCH THINGS
HAVE CHANGED IN 400 YEARS,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
HE HOPES TO HELP
PEOPLE REALIZE THAT

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
THE WAY WE TREAT
OUR LANDSCAPE TODAY

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
HAS AN IMPACT ON
FUTURE GENERATIONS.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
THE QUESTION IS WHAT
IS MANHATTAN GOING TO

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
LOOK LIKE 200
YEARS FROM NOW?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
IS IT GOING TO BE
TALLER AND TALLER

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
AND TALLER BUILDINGS?

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
OR ARE WE GOING TO
LEAVE SOME PLACES

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
WHERE NATURE CAN
THRIVE AND SUPPORT US?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
THAT'S THE QUESTION
I'M TRYING TO ASK,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
