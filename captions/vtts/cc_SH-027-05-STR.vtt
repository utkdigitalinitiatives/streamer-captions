00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.700


2
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.070
This is the third time;

3
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.170
I hope good luck lies in odd numbers.

4
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.870
Away I go.

5
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.370
They say there is divinity in odd numbers,

6
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.800
either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!

7
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.630
I'll provide you a chain;

8
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.900
and I'll do what I can

9
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.530
to get you a pair of horns.

10
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.100
Away, I say; time wears:

11
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.100
hold up your head, and mince.

12
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.400
How now, Master Brook!

13
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.170
Master Brook,

14
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.770
the matter will be known to-night, or never.

15
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.570
Be you in the park about midnight,

16
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.830
at Herne's oak, and you shall see wonders.

17
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.770
Went you not to her this morning, sir,

18
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.470
as you told me you had appointed?

19
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.400
I went to her, Master Brook,

20
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.230
as you see, like a poor old man:

21
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.000
but I came from her, Master Brook,

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.630
like a poor old woman.

23
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.000
That same knave Ford, her husband,

24
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.600
hath the finest mad devil

25
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.570
of jealousy in him,

26
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.800
Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy.

27
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.070
I will tell you: he beat me grievously,

28
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.500
in the shape of a woman;

29
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.130
for in the shape of man, Master Brook,

30
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.400
I fear not Goliath with a weaver's beam;

31
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.600
I am in haste; go along with me:

32
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.770
I'll tell you all.

33
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.930
Since I plucked geese,

34
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.070
played truant and whipped top,

35
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.870
I knew not what 'twas

36
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.100
to be beaten till lately.

37
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.700
Follow me: I'll tell you strange things

38
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.200
of this knave Ford, on whom to-night

39
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.130
I will be revenged,

40
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.470
and I will deliver his wife

41
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.470
into your hand. Follow.

42
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.930
Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.

43
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.570
Come, come;

44
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.170
we'll couch i' the castle-ditch

45
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.200
till we see the light of our fairies.

46
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.500
Remember, son Slender,my daughter.

47
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.330
Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her

48
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.570
and we have a nay-word how

49
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.770
to know one another:

50
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.230
I come to her in white, and cry 'mum;'

51
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.270
she cries 'budget;'

52
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.570
and by that we know one another.

53
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.230
That's good too:

54
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.730
but what needs either your 'mum'

55
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.670
or her 'budget?'

56
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.570
the white will decipher her well enough.

57
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.800
It hath struck ten o'clock.

58
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.530
The night is dark;

59
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.500
light and spirits will become it well.

60
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.900
Heaven prosper our sport!

61
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.830
No man means evil but the devil,

62
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.500
and we shall know him by his horns.

63
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.600
Let's away; follow me.

64
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.170
Master doctor, my daughter is in green:

65
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.670
when you see your time,

66
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.600
take her by the band,

67
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.700
away with her to the deanery,

68
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.800
and dispatch it quickly.

69
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.900
Go before into the Park:

70
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.900
we two must go together.

71
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.630
I know vat I have to do. Adieu.

72
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.100
Fare you well, sir.

73
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.470
My husband will not rejoice so much

74
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.300
at the abuse of Falstaff

75
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.700
as he will chafe at the doctor's

76
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.800
marrying my daughter:

77
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.670
but 'tis no matter;

78
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.900
better a little chiding

79
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.730
than a great deal of heart-break.

80
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.330
Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies,

81
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.000
and the Welsh devil Hugh?

82
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.870
They are all couched

83
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.800
in a pit hard by Herne's oak,

84
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.830
with obscured lights;

85
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.400
which, at the very instant of Falstaff's

86
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.330
and our meeting,

87
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.070
they will at once display to the night.

88
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.830
That cannot choose but amaze him.

89
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.930
If he be not amazed, he will be mocked;

90
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.070
if he be amazed, he will every way be mocked.

91
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.800
We'll betray him finely.

92
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.500
Against such lewdsters and their lechery

93
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.000
Those that betray them do no treachery.

94
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.800
The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!

95
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.930
Trib, trib, fairies; come;

96
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.800
and remember your parts: Trib.

97
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.530
be pold, I pray you; follow me into the pit;

98
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.330
and when I give the watch-'ords,

99
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.600
do as I pid you:

100
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.330
come, come; trib, trib.

101
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.370
The Windsor bell hath struck twelve;

102
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.930
the minute draws on.

103
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.170
Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me!

104
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.700
Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull

105
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.970
for thy Europa;

106
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.370
love set on thy horns.

107
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.630
O powerful love! that,

108
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.730
in some respects, makes a a man a beast,

109
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.930
in some other, a beast a man.

110
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.030
When gods have hot backs,

111
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.470
what shall poor men do?

112
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.830
For me, I am here a Windsor stag;

113
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.570
and the fattest,

114
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.670
I think, i' the forest.

115
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.500
Send me a cool rut-time, Jove,

116
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.030
or who can blame me to piss my tallow?

117
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.100
Who comes here? my doe?

118
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.770
My deer? my male deer?

119
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.330
My doe with the black scut!

120
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.500
Let the sky rain potatoes;

121
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.830
let it thunder to the tune of Green Sleeves,

122
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.700
hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes;

123
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.230
let there come a tempest of provocation,

124
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.030
I will shelter me here.

125
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.400
Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.

126
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.370
Divide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch:

127
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.100
I will keep my sides to myself,

128
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.900
my shoulders for the fellow of this walk,

129
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.230
and my horns I bequeath your husbands.

130
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.400
Am I a woodman, ha?

131
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.870
Speak I like Herne the hunter?

132
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.500
Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience;

133
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.570
he makes restitution.

134
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.830
As I am a true spirit, welcome!

135
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.700
(â™ª horns)

136
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.870
Alas, what noise?

137
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.130
Heaven forgive our sins

138
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.430
What should this be?

139
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.730
Away, away!

140
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:25.200
I think the devil will not have me damned,

141
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.130
lest the oil that's in me

142
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.030
should set hell on fire;

143
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.370
he would never else cross me thus.

144
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.430
Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,

145
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.500
You moonshine revellers and shades of night,

146
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.270
You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,

147
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.030
Attend your office and your quality.

148
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:04.530
Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.

149
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.070
Elves, list your names;

150
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.900
silence, you airy toys.

151
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.170
Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:

152
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.470
Where fires thou find'st unraked

153
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.270
and hearths unswept,

154
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.070
There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry:

155
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:24.830
Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.

156
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.600
They are fairies;

157
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.530
he that speaks to them shall die:

158
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.300
I'll wink and couch:

159
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.400
no man their works must eye.

160
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.630
Where's Bede?

161
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.430
Here!

162
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.930
Go you, and where you find a maid

163
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:40.530
That, ere she sleep,

164
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.430
has thrice her prayers said,

165
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:45.430
Raise up the organs of her fantasy;

166
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.530
Sleep she as sound as careless infancy:

167
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.930
But those as sleep and think not on their sins,

168
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.500
Pinch them, arms, legs, backs,

169
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.970
shoulders, sides and shins.

170
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:56.730
Where's Pede?

171
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.070
Here!

172
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.130
Go you and see where Brokers sleep.

173
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.530
and foxide servants with their mace.

174
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.370
Go lay the proctors in the streets,

175
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.130
and pinch the lousy servants face,

176
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.730
spare none of these when there abed,

177
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.630
but such whose nose looks blue and red.

178
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.430
About, about;

179
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.530
Search Windsor Castle,

180
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.470
elves, within and out:

181
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.970
Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:

182
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:26.000
That it may stand till the perpetual doom,

183
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.600
In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,

184
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.870
Worthy the owner, and the owner it.

185
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:38.730
Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,

186
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.730
Our dance of custom round about the oak

187
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.270
Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.

188
00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.370
Pray you, lock hand in hand;

189
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.100
yourselves in order set

190
00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.970
And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,

191
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.170
To guide our measure round about the tree.

192
00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:04.270
But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.

193
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.200
Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy,

194
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.400
lest he transform me to a piece of cheese!

195
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.630
Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd

196
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.930
even in thy birth.

197
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.270
With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:

198
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.600
If he be chaste, the flame will back descend

199
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.500
And turn him to no pain; but if he start,

200
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.070
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.

201
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.570
A trial, come.

202
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.730
Come, will this wood take fire?

203
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.500
Oh, Oh, Oh!

204
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.330
Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!

205
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.230
About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;

206
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.030
And, as you trip,

207
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:43.630
still pinch him to your time.

208
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.700
(â™ª song)

209
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.300
Fie on sinful fantasy!

210
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.500
Fie on lust and luxury!

211
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.970
Lust is but a bloody fire,

212
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.900
Kindled with unchaste desire,

213
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.170
Fed in heart, whose flames aspire

214
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.430
As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.

215
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:12.000
Pinch him, fairies, mutually;

216
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.800
Pinch him for his villany;

217
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.770
Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,

218
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:24.270
Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.

219
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:42.400
Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,

220
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:50.330
Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out. â™ª

221
00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:10.430
(â™ª music continues)

222
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:10.270
(â™ªhorns)

223
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:30.770
God save you, Sir John Falstaff.

224
00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:34.070
Nay, do not fly;

225
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.370
I think we have watch'd you now

226
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.070
Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?

227
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.470
I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher

228
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:47.300
Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?

229
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.000
See you these, husband?

230
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.100
do not these fair yokes

231
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.670
Become the forest better than the town?

232
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:58.930
Now, sir, who's a cuckold now?

233
00:13:58.930 --> 00:13:59.900
Master Brook,

234
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.600
Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave;

235
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.400
here are his horns, Master Brook:

236
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.000
and, Master Brook,

237
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.600
he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford's

238
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.100
but his buck-basket,

239
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.400
his cudgel, and twenty pounds of money,

240
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.770
which must be paid to Master Brook;

241
00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:22.770
his horses are arrested fo rit, Master Brook.

242
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:26.570
Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet.

243
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.170
I will never take you for my love again;

244
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.730
but I will always count you my deer.

245
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.530
I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.

246
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.570
Ay, and an ox too:

247
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:44.000
both the proofs are extant.

248
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.600
And these are not fairies?

249
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.670
(laughing)

250
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.800
I was three or four times in the thought

251
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.400
they were not fairies:

252
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.370
and yet the guiltiness of my mind,

253
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.670
the sudden surprise of my powers,

254
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.600
drove the grossness of the foppery

255
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.500
into a received belief,

256
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.370
in despite of the teeth

257
00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:06.600
of all rhyme and reason,

258
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.930
that they were fairies.

259
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.430
See now how wit may be made

260
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:11.330
a Jack-a-Lent,

261
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.000
when 'tis upon ill employment!

262
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.100
Sir John Falstaff, serve Got,

263
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.200
and leave your desires,

264
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.100
and fairies will not pinse you.

265
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.500
Well said, fairy Hugh.

266
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.800
And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.

267
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.800
I will never mistrust my wife again

268
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.270
till thou art able to woo her in good English.

269
00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:38.170
Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it,

270
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.170
that it wants matter

271
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.470
to prevent so gross o'erreaching as this?

272
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.430
Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too?

273
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.230
shall I have a coxcomb of frize?

274
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:48.930
'Tis time I were choked

275
00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.400
with a piece of toasted cheese.

276
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.530
Seese is not good to give putter;

277
00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.630
your belly is all putter.

278
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.600
'Seese' and 'putter'!

279
00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.400
have I lived to stand at the taunt

280
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.270
of one that makes fritters of English?

281
00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.570
This is enough to be the decay

282
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.970
of lust and late-walking through the realm.

283
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.930
Why Sir John, do you think,

284
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.970
though we would have thrust virtue

285
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.770
out of our hearts by the head and shoulders

286
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:13.670
and have given ourselves

287
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.800
without scruple to hell,

288
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.800
that ever the devil

289
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.600
could have made you our delight?

290
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.430
What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?

291
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:24.870
A puffed man?

292
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:29.430
Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?

293
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.330
And one that is as slanderous as Satan?

294
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:32.330
And as poor as Job?

295
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.030
And as wicked as his wife?

296
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.530
And given to fornications,

297
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.170
and to taverns and sack

298
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.270
and wine and metheglins,

299
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.430
and to drinkings and

300
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:46.070
swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?

301
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.600
Well, I am your theme:

302
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.970
you have the start of me;

303
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.130
I am dejected;

304
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.970
I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel;

305
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.200
ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me:

306
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.470
use me as you will.

307
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:01.670
Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor,

308
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:02.770
to one Master Brook,

309
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.230
that you have cozened of money,

310
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:05.970
to whom you should have been a pander:

311
00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.230
over and above that you have suffered,

312
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:09.700
I think to repay that money

313
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.000
will be a biting affliction.

314
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.300
Nay good husband.

315
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.600
Let that go to make amends. Forget that sum.

316
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.470
Then we'll all be friends.

317
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.770
Yet be cheerful, knight:

318
00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.670
thou shalt eat a posset to-night at my house;

319
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.900
where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife,

320
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.700
that now laughs at thee:

321
00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:31.730
tell her Master Slender hath married her daughter.

322
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.400
Doctors doubt that:

323
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.870
if Anne Page be my daughter,

324
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.230
she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.

325
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.530
Whoa ho! ho, father Page!

326
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.130
Son, how now! how now, son!

327
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.170
have you dispatched?

328
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:45.300
Dispatched!

329
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.900
I'll make the best in Gloucestershire know on't;

330
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.030
would I were hanged, la, else.

331
00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:49.970
Of what, son?

332
00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.070
I came yonder at Eton

333
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.670
to marry Mistress Anne Page,

334
00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.030
and she's a great lubberly boy.

335
00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.670
If it had not been i' the church,

336
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.230
I would have swinged him,

337
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.800
or he should have swinged me.

338
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.200
If I did not think it had been Anne Page,

339
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.570
would I might never stir!

340
00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.770
--and 'tis a postmaster's boy.

341
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.930
Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.

342
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.600
What need you tell me that?

343
00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.700
I think so, when I took a boy for a girl.

344
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.200
If I had been married to him,

345
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.500
for all he was in woman's apparel,

346
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.570
I would not have had him.

347
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:19.900
Why, this is your own folly.

348
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.070
Did not I tell you how

349
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.330
you should know my daughter by her garments?

350
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.330
I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,'

351
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.670
and she cried 'budget,'

352
00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:29.270
as Anne and I had appointed;

353
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:34.430
and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.

354
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:37.200
Good George, be not angry:

355
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.500
I knew of your purpose;

356
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.670
turned my daughter into green;

357
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.000
and, indeed, she is now with the doctor

358
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.570
at the deanery, and there married.

359
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.670
Vere is Mistress Page?

360
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.030
By gar, I am cozened:

361
00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.200
I ha' married un garcon, a boy;

362
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.930
un paysan, by gar, a boy;

363
00:18:55.930 --> 00:19:00.730
it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.

364
00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.200
Why, did you take her in green?

365
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:07.400
Ay, by gar, and 'tis a garson, jacque boy:

366
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.200
by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.

367
00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:22.670
This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?

368
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:29.470
My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.

369
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.200
How now, Master Fenton!

370
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.530
Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!

371
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.800
Now, mistress,

372
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.400
how chance you went not with Master Slender?

373
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.630
Why went you not with master doctor, maid?

374
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:47.070
You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.

375
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.370
You would have married her most shamefully,

376
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.500
Where there was no proportion held in love.

377
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.230
The truth is, she and I,

378
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.930
long since contracted,

379
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:59.670
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.

380
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.300
The offence is holy that she hath committed;

381
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.870
And this deceit loses the name of craft,

382
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.370
Of disobedience, or unduteous title,

383
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:11.930
Since therein she doth evitate and shun

384
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:15.000
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,

385
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.830
Which forced marriage

386
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:20.830
would have brought upon her.

387
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:27.270
Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:

388
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.030
In love the heavens themselves

389
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.300
do guide the state;

390
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:40.870
Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.

391
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.030
I am glad,

392
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.900
though you have ta'en a special stand to strike at me,

393
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:49.130
that your arrow hath glanced.

394
00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:55.430
Well, what remedy?

395
00:20:55.430 --> 00:21:01.800
Fenton, heaven give thee joy!

396
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:06.930
What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.

397
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:08.200
When night-dogs run,

398
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.370
all sorts of deer are chased.

399
00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:15.270
Well, I will muse no further.

400
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:16.800
Master Fenton,

401
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:22.000
Heaven give you many, many merry days!

402
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:29.230
I also will dance and eat plums at your wedding.

403
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.130
Good husband, let us every one go home,

404
00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.970
And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;

405
00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:38.530
Sir John and all.

406
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.770
Let it be so. Sir John,

407
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.000
To Master Brook you yet shall keep your word

408
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.900
For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.

409
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:17.670
(â™ªsinging)

410
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.670
