WEBVTT

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
IT'S A NORMAL PART
 OF GROWING UP.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
- YOU'RE GONNA RUIN THAT CHAIR.
- NO, TO GROWN UP FOR NAP.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
BUT WHAT'S THE LINE
 BETWEEN JUST TESTING LIMITS,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
AND SOMETHING
 FAR MORE SERIOUS?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
TODAY,
 A REMOTE ISLAND

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
AND A NEW CONCEPT IN HELP
 FOR TROUBLED KIDS...

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
THEY CAN'T RUN FROM
THE PROGRAM AND THEY CAN'T
RUN FROM THEIR FEELINGS.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Narrator:
 ...AND HOW TO READ SIGNALS
 YOUR OWN CHILD

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
MAY BE HEADED FOR TROUBLE.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
WHEN A PARENT REALIZES
THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY DON'T
LIKE THEIR CHILD ANYMORE...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
SHE SAID, "I'M RUNNING AWAY,"
AND SHE STARTED RUNNING
THROUGH A CROWD.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
...WELL, I'D CERTAINLY TRY
TO GET BELOW THE SURFACE.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Narrator:
 "BRAZELTON ON PARENTING."

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
( theme music playing )

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
SOME INNOCUOUS NAMES

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
HAVE TAKEN ON NEW MEANING
FOR US.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
NAMES LIKE COLUMBINE
AND JONESBORO.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
VIOLENCE IN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE
HAS REACHED NEW LEVELS

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
OF SHOCK AND HORROR.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
TODAY WE'RE GONNA TAKE
A CLOSER LOOK

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
AT KIDS IN TROUBLE,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
AND EXPLORE NEW WAYS
TO HELP THEM.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
WE BEGIN WITH A TRIP
TO A REMOTE ISLAND

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
OFF THE COAST
OF MASSACHUSETTS

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
AND A PROGRAM COMMITTED
TO THE PRINCIPLE

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
THAT THERE IS NO CHILD
WHO CAN'T BE SAVED.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Brazelton:
 IT'S AN ISLAND

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
IT'S LOCATION

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
MEASURED NOT IN LATITUDE
 AND LONGITUDE,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
BUT IN THE HUMAN SUFFERING
 IT'S SEEN.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
YOU SEE,
 100 YEARS AGO,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
PENIKESE ISLAND WAS USED
 AS A LEPER COLONY.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
NOW IT'S HOME TO A DIFFERENT
 TYPE OF OUTCAST--

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
TEENAGE BOYS WHO HAVE
 NO PLACE ELSE TO GO,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
BOYS LIKE WHITNEY BYRNE.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Pam Brighton:
 SIX MONTHS AGO

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I MET WHITNEY
 FOR THE FIRST TIME.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
HE CAME OUT TO THE ISLAND
 WITH HIS FATHER,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
ALTHOUGH THEY
 WERE TOGETHER.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Whitney:
 I COULDN'T EVEN TALK
 WITH MY PARENTS

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
WITHOUT LIKE GOING OFF AT THEM.
 I WAS ARGUING EVERYTHING.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
LIKE, IF I WERE ASKED
 TO DO SOMETHING I WAS LIKE,
 "AW, SCREW YOU."

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
WHIT WAS IN A SCHOOL
IN ACTON.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Felice Pomeranz:
 HE PROMPTLY GOT EXPELLED
 FROM THAT SCHOOL.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
HE GOT DEEPER
 AND DEEPER INTO TROUBLE.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
HE'S BEEN A KID WHOSE--

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
WHOSE HAD SOME DEEP-
SEATED ANGER.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Mother:
 THERE WAS NOTHING THAT NEITHER
 MICHAEL NOR I COULD SAY,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
DO THAT WAS GONNA HAVE
 VERY MUCH IMPACT.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Brighton:
 AND WHITNEY WAS ALSO GETTING
 IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
HE HAD A NUMBER OF CHARGES

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
THAT MOUNTED UP,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
AND UH...

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
HE WAS FACED AT THAT POINT
WITH A CHOICE OF,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
"WELL, THERE'S PENIKESE
OR THERE'S JAIL."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
CHOSE TO COME HERE.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Brazelton:
 THE PENIKESE ISLAND SCHOOL

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
IS A LAST STOP FOR MANY KIDS
 LIKE WHITNEY.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
George Cadwalder:
 THESE KIDS ARE SOCIETY'S
 PARIAHS.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
IT'S HARD FOR SOCIETY
TO LIKE DELINQUENT KIDS.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
PENIKESE, DAVE MASCH.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Brazelton:
 DAVE MASCH, CO-FOUNDER
 OF PENIKESE,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
HAS BEEN WORKING WITH TROUBLED
 CHILDREN FOR 30 YEARS.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Masch:
 YOU WANNA GO ACROSS
 THIS PART HERE.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
CONCENTRATING ON
GETTING THE PRESSURE
OUT IN THE MIDDLE.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Masch: IN THE BEGINNING
 WE DEALT MOSTLY WITH THESE
 DELINQUENT BOYS.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
BUT NOW WE'RE GETTING
 KIDS OFTEN

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
THAT HAVE MORE BEHAVIORAL

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS
THAN OUR EARLY KIDS DID.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
THE CRIMINAL KIDS TEND
TO BE SURVIVOR TYPES

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
AND ALL THE KIDS WE HAVE NOW
ARE KIDS THAT,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
UM, WOULD POSSIBLY
HURT THEMSELVES.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
SO, JOHN,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
WHAT ARE YOU WRITING THERE,
OR IS IT A SECRET?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
IT'S A SECRET.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Brazelton:
 THESE ARE TODAY'S LOST BOYS.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
MOST WILL TELL YOU THEY DON'T
 WANT TO BE FOUND.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Brighton:
 THEY ARE PROS

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
AT BEING ABLE TO GET PEOPLE
 TO GIVE UP ON THEM.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
YOU KNOW, THEY'VE DEVELOPED
THAT STYLE.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
AND IT'S SORT OF
A, UM,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
"I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA GIVE UP
ON ME EVENTUALLY,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
SO, YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN'T FIRE ME. I QUIT."

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
( pigs squealing )

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Brazelton:
 WHITNEY WAS READY TO QUIT
 AS SOON AS HE ARRIVED.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
FIRST IMPRESSION WAS--
I SAW THE PIGS AND I WAS LIKE,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
"HELL NO, I DON'T WANNA
 BE HERE."

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Brazelton:
 PIGS?  OH YES, THE PIGS.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
YOU SEE, PENIKESE HAS
 NO TELEVISION,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
NO ELECTRICITY,
 NO RUNNING WATER.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Man:
 YOU GUYS WANNA GIVE A HAND
 GETTING THESE BOTTLES?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Brazelton:
 OTHER THAN THE SUPPLIES
 THAT COME IN ONCE A WEEK

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
BY BOAT, THE BOYS ARE
 ENTIRELY SELF-SUFFICIENT.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
IF YOU WANT HEAT,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
CHOP WOOD.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
BREAKFAST?
 FEED THE CHICKENS.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
YOU'LL HAVE EGGS.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Masch:
 I THINK IT GIVES THE KID

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
SOME IDEA OF THE VALUE
 OF WORK.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Brazelton:
 CONDITIONS ARE HARSH
 AT PENIKESE,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
BUT IT ISN'T A BOOT CAMP.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
WE'VE LEARNED THAT WHILE
 THEY SOUND LIKE AN ANSWER,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
BOOT CAMPS RARELY WORK.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
BUT PENIKESE DOES HAVE
 A MESSAGE.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Masch:
 WE ALSO LIKE KIDS TO LEARN

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
THAT THEY'RE NOT VICTIMS
TOTALLY,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
THAT THEY HAVE SOME CONTROL
OVER THEIR LIVES.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
AND THAT WHAT THEY DO AFFECTS
NOT ONLY THEIR WELL-BEING,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
BUT THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM.
AND THIS IS A LESSON

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
THAT'S NOT TOO OFTEN SEEN
IN THE MODERN WORLD.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
...AND WORK ALL DAY.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Brazelton:
 WHEN THEY LEAVE HERE,
 THESE BOYS

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
WILL HAVE TO DEAL
 WITH THE MODERN WORLD.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
AND FOR THAT
 THEY NEED EDUCATION.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
BUT WE DON'T USE
TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM STUFF.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Brazelton:
 THAT WHY IT'S PENIKESE
 ISLAND SCHOOL.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
SO IT'S 31.5 INCHES LONG.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
- WHAT'S HALF OF 31?
- HALF OF 30?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
WHAT'S HALF OF 30?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
- 15?
- 15, EXACTLY.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Masch:
 THESE KIDS AREN'T DUMB.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
WE'VE HAD KIDS OUT HERE
 THAT REALLY DON'T KNOW
 THE DAYS OF THE WEEK.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
WHAT THEY HAVEN'T HAD
 IS ANY EDUCATION
 TO SPEAK OF.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Brazelton:
 BUT THE KIDS LEARN SOMETHING
 EVEN MORE VALUABLE.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
- NICE ART.
- THANKS, MAN.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Brighton:
 THE BIGGEST PIECE OF WHAT
 WE DO IS WE TEACH KIDS

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
RELATIONSHIP SKILLS,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
AND TEACH THEM

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
THAT THEY CAN DISCOVER
THEIR OWN SENSE OF WORTH

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
AND ANSWER THE QUESTION,
 "DO I MATTER?"

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Brazelton:
 AS PEOPLE WHO WORK
 WITH TROUBLED CHILDREN

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
HAVE DISCOVERED,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
THESE ARE THE REAL SURVIVAL
 SKILLS THE KIDS NEED.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Virginia Root:
 PENIKESE IS A PLACE WHERE

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
THEY CAN LIVE
 AND BE COMFORTABLE

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
WITHOUT ANY BARS OR LOCKS.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
BUT STILL,
THEY CAN'T REALLY RUN AWAY.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
THEY CAN'T RUN
FROM THE PROGRAM

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
AND THEY CAN'T RUN
FROM THEIR FEELINGS.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Brazelton:
 AS FOR WHITNEY...

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Masch:
 AFTER HE GOT OVER
 HIS INITIAL SKEPTICISM

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
HE BEGAN TO BLOSSOM.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Whitney:
 WHEN I WAS HOME, I TOOK A LOT
 OF THINGS FOR GRANTED

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
LIKE HEAT, ELECTRICITY
AND ALL THAT.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
BUT YOU END UP REALIZING

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
WHAT YOU'VE TAKEN FOR GRANTED
ONCE YOU'RE OUT HERE
FOR A WHILE.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Michael:
 I THINK THAT WHIT IS NOW,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
AFTER BEING OUT HERE,
 THAT HE--

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
HE FEELS BETTER ABOUT HIMSELF,
HAS A BETTER SELF-IMAGE.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Brazelton:
 SO MUCH BETTER

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
THAT AFTER SIX MONTHS
 ON PENIKESE,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
WHITNEY IS READY
 TO SAY GOODBYE.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
LATER IN OUR SHOW,
 WHITNEY'S LAST DAY
 ON PENIKESE ISLAND.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I'M GONNA MISS THIS PLACE
EVEN THOUGH AT TIMES
I HATED IT.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
WITH US TODAY
IS CRYSTAL HOLMES,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
OUR INTERNET EXPERT
 FROM IBM.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
CRYSTAL, WHAT'S AVAILABLE
ONLINE FOR PARENTS

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
WHO THINK THAT THEIR CHILDREN
NEED SPECIAL HELP

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
FOR BEHAVIORAL ISSUES?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
THERE ARE A LOT OF RESOURCES
AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
THE FIRST SITE WE'RE GONNA
GO TO TODAY

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
IS THE "ADOLESCENCE DIRECTORY
ON-LINE."

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
TEENAGE YEARS ARE A VERY
 DIFFICULT TIME,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
AND IF PARENTS ARE STRUGGLING
 WITH BEHAVIORAL ISSUES,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
THEY CAN GO ON TO THIS SITE

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
AND LOOK AT SEVERAL
 DIFFERENT TOPICS,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
INCLUDING CONFLICT
 AND VIOLENCE,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
HEALTH
AND HEALTH RISKS.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
THERE'S EVEN A POINT
ON THIS SITE

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
WHERE TEENS CAN GO 
 AND SEARCH THE SITE

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
AND GET INFORMATION
 THAT THEY WOULD LIKE.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
ANOTHER SITE
 THAT'S OF VALUE

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
IS THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD
AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
ON THIS SITE
 WE'LL ACTUALLY GO IN

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
AND WE CAN DO A SEARCH WORD
 ON THE WORD "VIOLENCE."

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
AND WE SEE THAT THERE'S
 A WEALTH OF INFORMATION

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
RANGING FROM PREVENTION
 AND TREATMENT OF JUVENILE
 VIOLENCE

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
TO CHILDREN AND TV VIOLENCE.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
ONE THING FOR US
TO REMEMBER,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
THE INTERNET IS A RESOURCE,
IT'S NOT A CURE.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
BUT THIS IS INFORMATION
 THAT WE CAN USE TO INFORM
 OURSELVES

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
AND DETERMINE
IF WE NEED TO TALK TO
A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
YOU KNOW, I THINK
EVERY PARENT TODAY WONDERS

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
EVERY TIME A CHILD GETS
OUT OF CONTROL,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
IS HE GONNA END UP
LIKE COLORADO OR ARKANSAS?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
SO THIS HAS GOT TO BE
REASSURING TO PARENTS.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
OUR INTERNET QUESTION TODAY
COMES FROM KELLY

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
IN MOUNT PLEASANT, MICHIGAN.
HER QUESTION READS,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
"ONE OF MY TWIN TWO-YEAR-OLD
 BOYS IS GOING THROUGH A PHASE

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
OF BEATING HIS HEAD ON THINGS
AND THROWING FITS WHENEVER
THERE IS CONFLICT.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
HIS TWIN IS BEGINNING
 TO EXHIBIT THE SAME BEHAVIOR

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
WHEN HIS BROTHER
 THROWS A FIT.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
SHOULD I STEP IN WHEN HE
 HEAD-BUTTS HIS BROTHER?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
IS HE IN DANGER OF HURTING
 HIMSELF OR SOMEONE ELSE?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I CAN SEE
WHY YOU'RE WORRIED,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
BECAUSE THIS IS PRETTY
VIOLENT BEHAVIOR.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S NORMAL
AT TWO YEARS OF AGE,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
AND THE THING THAT YOU TELL ME
WHICH I'M MOST REASSURED BY

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
IS THAT IT ALWAYS COME UP
AT A TIME WHEN YOU
COULD EXPECT IT.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
A TWO-YEAR-OLD JUST DOES
LIE DOWN ON THE FLOOR

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
AND HAVE A TEMPER TANTRUM,
OR BUTT HIS HEAD ON THE FLOOR.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
AND THEY AREN'T GONNA REALLY
HURT THEIR HEADS THAT WAY.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
BUT THIS IS AIMED
AT THE TWIN.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
AND OF COURSE,
THIS IS PEAKING AT A TIME

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
WHEN SIBLING RIVALRY
IS COMING TO THE SURFACE.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
THE OTHER TWIN BETTER LEARN
HOW TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
BUT I GUESS THE ONE THING
I WOULD URGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
IS ARE YOU REINFORCING
IT BY YOUR ANXIETY?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
MAYBE THERE ARE WAYS YOU COULD
INTERFERE IN OTHER WAYS,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
LIKE PICKING HIM UP
AND LOVING HIM

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
AT A TIME WHEN YOU KNOW
HE'S GONNA BE UPSET.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
OR TALKING TO HIM ABOUT IT
IN BETWEEN.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
"YOU KNOW, WHENEVER YOU GET
UPSET YOU LIE DOWN ON THE FLOOR

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
AND SCREAM OR YOU BUTT
YOUR HEAD INTO THE FLOOR,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
OR YOU BUTT YOUR BROTHER.
IS THERE A WAY I CAN HELP YOU?"

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
AND EVEN AT TWO, I THINK YOU
CAN BEGIN TO COMMUNICATE

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
WITH HIM IN A WAY THAT MAY
HELP HIM LATER ON.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
IT MAY TAKE A WHILE.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
PRESENTED BY THE PARENTING
 INSTITUTE AT pampers.com.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
JOINING US TODAY
IS DR. JOSHUA SPARROW,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
CHILD PSYCHIATRIST
 FROM CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL
 IN BOSTON.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
JOSH, PARENTS ARE SO WORRIED
TODAY ABOUT AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
OR OUT-OF-CONTROL BEHAVIOR
IN THEIR CHILD.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
AND I WONDER, CAN YOU
GIVE US SOME GUIDELINES

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
ABOUT WHEN THEY SHOULD BE
WORRIED ABOUT BEHAVIORS
IN THEIR CHILDREN?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I THINK THE FIRST TIME
TO START WORRYING

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
IS WHEN A PARENT REALIZES

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY DON'T
LIKE THEIR CHILD ANYMORE.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
THAT'S THE WORST
 KIND OF FEELING

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
A PARENT CAN HAVE
 ABOUT THEIR OWN CHILD.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
I THINK IF YOU FEEL AS IF
SOMEHOW THE LOVE IS GONE,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE KIND
OF ANGER AND FRUSTRATION

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
THAT EVERY PARENT HAS
TO FEEL FROM TIME TO TIME
WITH THEIR CHILD.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
AND I WOULD SAY
THAT THE NEXT SIGN
IS VERY SIMILAR,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
AND THAT'S WHEN
OTHER KIDS DON'T LIKE
THEIR CHILD EITHER.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
AT AGES THREE OR FOUR,
CHILDREN ARE STILL WORKING
VERY HARD

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
AT LEARNING HOW TO MAKE
FRIENDS, AS THEY DO, OF COURSE,
ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
BUT CERTAINLY BY FIVE
OR SIX, CHILDREN ARE WORKING
ON MAKING FRIENDSHIPS

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO HOLD
 ON TO A COUPLE.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
BUT IF THEY FIND THEMSELVES
 GOING OUT AND MAKING FRIENDS

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
WHO JUST DON'T STICK,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
AND DISCOVERING THAT ONE FRIEND
AFTER ANOTHER

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
JUST CHOOSES NOT TO BE
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
IT MAY BE BECAUSE THE CHILD
IS TOO RIGID OR TOO INFLEXIBLE.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
DO YOU THINK THESE KIDS
ARE JUST SO TIED UP
IN THEMSELVES,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
THEY CAN'T BE
SENSITIVE TO OTHER--
OTHER PEOPLE?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I WOULD LOOK
AT IT THIS WAY--
I WOULD THINK ABOUT

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
THE CAPACITY TO BE FLEXIBLE

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
AND TO NEGOTIATE
OR TO COMPROMISE

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
AS A SPECIAL KIND
OF SKILL

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
THAT DEVELOPS AT DIFFERENT
RATES IN DIFFERENT CHILDREN.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
AND IN THESE CHILDREN,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
IT MAY DEVELOP MORE SLOWLY
 THAN IN OTHERS.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
AND PROBLEM WITH IT
 IS THAT THEY START

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
LOSING OUT ON FRIENDSHIPS,
AND THEN, OF COURSE,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
THEY FEEL TERRIBLY ABOUT
THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY KNOW
THAT THEY'RE FAILING.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE
BEING REJECTED.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
AND THOSE ARE THE KIDS
THAT BECOME BULLIES

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
AND SORT OF TRY TO TAKE ALL
THE ATTENTION AWAY

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
FROM ALL THE OTHER KIDS
IN SCHOOL?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
I THINK SOME OF THOSE
CHILDREN WILL HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO BECOME BULLIES.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY
THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
TO MANAGE WITHOUT NEGOTIATING
AND WITHOUT COMPROMISING

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
IS TO TRY TO ALWAYS HAVE IT
THEIR WAY BY USING FORCE.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
BUT I THINK THERE IS
ANOTHER KIND OF CHILD

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
WHO I WOULD WORRY ABOUT,
WHO IS WITHDRAWN.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
AND I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT A CHILD WHO IS
TEMPERAMENTALLY SHY,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
BECAUSE THAT CHILD
CAN OPEN UP

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
WITH CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
BUT A CHILD WHO IS
WITHDRAWN FROM EVERYBODY,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
WHO'S UNREACHABLE
OR INCOMMUNICATIVE,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
IS ANOTHER KIND OF CHILD
THAT I WOULD WORRY ABOUT.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
SORT OF THESE
HYPERSENSITIVE KIDS THAT YOU
REALLY CAN'T BREAK THROUGH

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
THESE SHELLS THEY'VE
PUT AROUND THEM.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
AND WHERE YOU WORRY
THAT SOMETHING IS GOING
ON INSIDE THEM

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
AND THEY JUST HAVE NO WAY
OF SHOWING YOU.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
IF YOU HAVE THE SENSE
THAT THERE REALLY IS
VERY LITTLE

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
THAT YOUR CHILD CAN
FEEL GOOD ABOUT
FOR THEMSELVES,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
IF THEY'RE CRITICAL ABOUT
JUST ABOUT EVERY ASPECT

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
OF THEIR BEHAVIOR,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
THEN I THINK IT'S
PRETTY CLEAR.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
IF A CHILD,
ON THE OTHER HAND,
HAS A BALANCED PERSPECTIVE,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
WHERE THEY CAN BE
HONEST ABOUT

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
WHERE SOME CRITICISM
OF THEMSELVES MIGHT
BE WARRANTED

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
AND CAN RECOGNIZE,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
SOME OF THEIR STRENGTHS
AND SOME OF THE THINGS

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
THAT THEY HAVE TO BE PROUD OF,
THAT KIND OF BALANCE, I THINK,
IS A HOPEFUL SIGN.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
IF YOU'RE ABLE TO MAINTAIN
A RELATIONSHIP

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
WITH YOUR ADOLESCENT
WHERE THEY KEEP TALKING
TO YOU,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
THEY KEEP ON TELLING
YOU WHAT'S GOING ON,
WHERE THEY FEEL

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
THEY CAN BE OPEN WITH YOU--
NOT ABOUT EVERYTHING,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
BECAUSE CERTAINLY THEY NEED
TO DO SOME THINGS ON THEIR OWN
AND NOT TELL YOU--

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
BUT IF THERE'S STILL
COMMUNICATION, YOU MAY NOT
HAVE TO FEEL

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
THAT YOU KNOW
ABOUT ALL OF THE WORKINGS
OF THEIR INNER LIFE.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
AND THAT'S DIFFICULT,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
BUT PERHAPS NOT QUITE
 SO INTIMIDATING.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I THINK I'M BEGINNING
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAID

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
WHICH I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND,
THAT YOU COULD

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
FEEL LIKE A PARENT
AND HATE YOUR CHILD,
OR NOT LIKE YOUR CHILD.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
THAT YOU REALLY AREN'T
COMMUNICATING WITH A CHILD

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
WAY BACK IN THE THIRD
OR FOURTH YEAR

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
IS A VERY DIFFICULT SIGN.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
THAT'S RIGHT.
I THINK IT'S HARD TO PICTURE,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
BECAUSE IT'S FAIRLY EXTREME.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
- IT IS.
- AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
THAT THAT'S WHEN
YOU NEED TO WORRY.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
GREAT, WELL,
THANK YOU.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
THAT GIVES ME INSIGHTS.
IT SCARES THE HELL
OUT OF ME,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
- BUT IT GIVES ME INSIGHTS.
- I'M SORRY THAT I SCARED
 YOU SO MUCH.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Brazelton:
 NEXT, WE TALK TO PARENTS
 ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Woman:
 WE'VE SOLD OUT.
 WE HAVE OVER 900 PEOPLE.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Brazelton:
 EACH YEAR WE TRAVEL
 ALL OVER AMERICA...

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Man:
 OUR COMMUNITY IS SO
 EXCITED ABOUT THIS--

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Brazelton:
 ...TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
 FROM THOUSANDS OF PARENTS.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Man:
 I'D LIKE TO WELCOME
 DR. T. BERRY BRAZELTON.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Brazelton:
 HERE ARE SOME OF THEM.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
GOOD MORNING,
MY NAME IS JEANIE

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
AND I HAVE A DAUGHTER
WHO WILL BE FIVE YEARS OLD
NEXT MONTH.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
AND WITHIN THE LAST
COUPLE OF MONTHS

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
SHE'S DECIDED TO TAKE UP
RUNNING AWAY FROM HOME.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED
WE KIND OF LAUGHED IT OFF,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
'CAUSE WE NEVER EXPECTED IT
AND IT WAS PRETTY COMICAL.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
SHE WENT UP TO HER ROOM
AFTER BEING REPRIMANDED

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
WITH AN ARMFUL OF CLOTHES
AND TWO PAIRS OF SHOES ON TOP

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
AND SHE SAID,
"I'M GOING TO GRAMMY'S."

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
HE SAID, "WELL IT TAKES THREE
HOURS TO DRIVE TO GRAMMY'S.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
IT'S GONNA TAKE TO WALK THERE?"

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
AND THE SECOND TIME
WAS ACTUALLY MORE SERIOUS.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
WE WERE IN--
I ACTUALLY HAD HER ALONE

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
WITH SOME OTHER CHILDREN
AT AN AMUSEMENT PARK.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
AND SHE WAS--

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
STARTED TO GET
INTO A MELTDOWN

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
AND SHE JUST TOOK OFF
FROM ME.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
SHE SAID,
"I'M RUNNING AWAY"

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
AND SHE STARTED RUNNING
THROUGH A CROWD.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
AND I HAD THESE OTHER KIDS
I NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
- AND SHE'S RUNNING, AND--
- SCARY.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
YEAH, IT WAS REALLY--

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
THAT WAS DEVASTATING.
AND THAT'S WHEN I SAID,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
"THERE'S SOMETHING MORE
GOING ON HERE."

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
I DON'T THINK RIGHT THEN
IS THE RIGHT TIME TO DISCUSS
IT, FOR ONE THING.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
'CAUSE SHE'S TOO UPTIGHT

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
AND SHE'LL THROW ANYTHING
BACK AT YOU

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
THAT COMES TO YOUR MIND
OR HERS.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
SO I'D WAIT
 TILL ANOTHER TIME

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
WHEN YOU'RE CLOSE TO HER,
 WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A TIME
 WITH HER ALONE.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH
 YOU LOVE HER,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
AND HOW IT FRIGHTENS YOU

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
WHEN SHE HAS THESE IDEAS
ABOUT RUNNING AWAY.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
AND SEE IF YOU CAN GET
TO WHAT'S UNDERNEATH.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
THANK YOU.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
- HI.
- HI, GOOD MORNING.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
I HAVE A QUESTION.
I HAVE A FOUR-AND-A-HALF-
YEAR-OLD SON

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SOME
AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
I THINK WHAT BOTHERS ME
THE MOST IS

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
THAT SOMETIMES
IT'S UNPROVOKED.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
IT'S, UH...

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
PUSHING, SHOVING
ANOTHER CHILD

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
FOR NO APPARENT REASON.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I'M WONDERING IF THERE
 IS SOME CONFUSION

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
WITH HIM BETWEEN ROUGH-HOUSING
WITH MY HUSBAND

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
AND WITH OLDER COUSINS--

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
OLDER KIDS,
AND BEING WITH PEERS
THE SAME AGE.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
HOW DOES HIS DAD
DEAL WITH IT?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
WELL, HE DOESN'T WORRY
ANYWAY THE WAY I WORRY

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
ABOUT STUFF.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
AND DAMN IT!
WHY DOESN'T HE JOIN ME?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
( laughs )
WHY?

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
I THINK HE...

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
FEELS PRETTY COMFORTABLE
WITH MY SON'S LEVEL OF--

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T EVEN
CALL IT AGGRESSION.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S JUST IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU CALL IT.
AGGRESSION IS A GOOD WORD

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
FOR WHAT IT IS.
YEAH, BECAUSE IT IS COMING
TO THE SURFACE.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
ALL LITTLE BOYS
THIS AGE DO.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
IT'S WHY
THEY HAVE NIGHTMARES,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
FEARS ABOUT--

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
NEW FEARS ABOUT THINGS,
BECAUSE ALL OF THIS

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
IS BOILING UP INSIDE THEM.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
AND THEY NEED TO LEARN
HOW TO DEAL WITH IT.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
AND THIS IS WHERE HIS DADDY
COMES IN SO HANDY.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
'CAUSE AS HE CAN IDENTIFY
WITH HIS DADDY

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
AND HOW HIS DADDY HANDLES
HIS OWN AGGRESSION,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
HE'LL GET SOME IDEAS ABOUT
HOW TO HANDLE IT SAFELY.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
THEY AREN'T THE ONES
THAT BECOME SERIAL KILLERS
LATER, AS FAR AS I KNOW.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
YOU KNOW, THAT'S-- I--
MAYBE, YOU KNOW, ALWAYS
IN THE BACK OF THINGS

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
YOU THINK, WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THOSE BOYS?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
- YEAH.
- YOU KNOW, BY THE TIME
  THEY HIT HIGH SCHOOL

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
WHAT WAS IT
IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
AND THAT'S VERY SCARY.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
WELL, I CAN ALMOST
GUARANTEE YOU

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
THAT THE BOYS
WHO HAVE FATHERS

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
WHO CAN GIVE THEM WAYS
OF DEALING

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
WITH SOME OF THESE
AGGRESSIVE FEELINGS

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
ARE NOT ANYWHERE
NEAR AS LIKELY

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
TO BE AT RISK FOR THIS.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
SO MAYBE YOUR PART
OF YOUR JOB IS TO STEP BACK
A LITTLE BIT NOW

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
AND GIVE
HIS DADDY A CHANCE.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
- OKAY.
- ( sighs )

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
G,"

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
PRESENTED BY THE PARENTING
 INSTITUTE AT pampers.com.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
PARENTS HAVE TO EXPECT
THEIR KIDS TO TEST LIMITS.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
THAT'S WHAT KIDS
ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
AND I THINK PARENTS
CAN BE REASSURED

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
THAT MOST MISBEHAVIOR
FALLS WITHIN THAT NORMAL
EXPECTED RANGE.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
BUT YOU'RE THE BEST JUDGE.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
IF YOU THINK THE BAD BEHAVIOR
IS SOMETHING MORE,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
SEEK HELP, STARTING
WITH YOUR PEDIATRICIAN.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
THE EARLIER YOU TAKE ACTION,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
THE QUICKER YOU CAN GET
YOUR CHILD BACK ON TRACK.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
LIKE WHITNEY BYRNES,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
JUVENILE DELINQUENT,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
JUST MAYBE
 EX-DELINQUENT.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
THE REASON WHY WE
HAVE GRADUATION...

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Brazelton:
 NOW, AFTER SIX MONTHS
 OF HARD WORK,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
IT'S GRADUATION DAY
 AT PENIKESE ISLAND SCHOOL.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
WE TALK ABOUT PENIKESE
BEING A PROGRAM OF CHOICE

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
AND, UM,
HOW MUCH GROWTH AND CHANGE

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
DEPENDS ON THE CHOICE
AND THE MOTIVATION

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
OF THE STUDENT HIMSELF,
NO MATTER WHAT WE DO.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
SO HERE'S A TANGIBLE SYMBOL
OF YOUR INTANGIBLE CHANGE.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
THAT'S NOT BAD.
( laughs )

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
CONGRATULATIONS,
 WHIT.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Brazelton:
 WHITNEY'S PARENTS GOT HIM
 THE HELP HE NEEDED.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
WELL, THERE ISN'T--
THERE ISN'T ANYWAY
I CAN...

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
REALLY...

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Brazelton:
 THE SUREST SIGN
 OF A PARENT'S LOVE.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
...THANK ALL OF YOU
THAT ARE, YOU KNOW...

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
ASSOCIATED
WITH THIS PROGRAM.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
I JUST--

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
I CAN'T PUT IT IN WORDS.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
BUT WE'RE EXTREMELY
PROUD OF WHIT,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
AND IT'S NOT JUST
OF WHAT HE'S ACCOMPLISHED,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
BUT IT'S, UH...

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
WE'RE PROUD
OF WHO HE IS.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Brazelton:
 AS FOR WHITNEY'S FUTURE...

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Brighton:
 I WISH I KNEW WHAT
 THE CHANCES WERE

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
FOR A LOT OF THE KIDS
 THAT LEAVE HERE.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
FOR WHITNEY.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
I KNOW THAT HE HAS PARENTS

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY
 DEVOTED TO HIM.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
AND, BOY, THAT COUNTS
 FOR A LOT.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Felice:
 I THINK WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
WHO YOU LOVE
 VERY VERY MUCH,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
AND THEY'RE
 HAVING PROBLEMS--

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
BUT YOU MUST NEVER GIVE UP,
I THINK, YOU MUST NEVER
GIVE UP ON A CHILD.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
SEE YOU, WHIT.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
( theme music playing )
