WEBVTT

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.130
FOR CENTURIES
FISHING WAS DONE

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.130
IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY
FRIENDLY WAY.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.800
LESS FISH WERE
EXTRACTED FROM THE WATER

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.030
THAN THOSE THAT
COULD REPRODUCE.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.260
WITH THE ADVENT OF
INDUSTRIAL FISHING

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.730
IN THE 19TH CENTURY,
NORTHERN EUROPEAN COASTS

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.730
BEGAN TO SHOW
THE FIRST SIGNS OF

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.530
UNSUSTAINABLE
FISHING ACTIVITY.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.000
SINCE THEN, SUCCEEDING
DECADES HAVE WITNESSED

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.960
A DROP IN WORLDWIDE
FISH POPULATIONS.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.100
THE EFFECTS OF OVER
EXPLOITATION HAVE GROWN

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.100
TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT
TODAY ONLY HALF OF ALL

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.930
COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE
SPECIES HAVE RUN OUT

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.460
AND ONLY ONE QUARTER
OF FISH RESOURCES

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.600
ARE CONSTANTLY
AVAILABLE.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.960
AT THIS LEVEL OF OUT OF
CONTROL EXPLOITATION,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.760
IN JUST 20 YEARS
AGE-OLD RECIPES SUCH AS

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.560
POTATOES AND COD OR
HERRINGS AND VINEGAR

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.430
WILL BE RELEGATED TO
HISTORICAL ARCHIVES.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.760
THE FISH WE EAT HAVE A GREAT
CAPACITY TO REPRODUCE.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.260
MAN CAN FISH
THEM INDEFINITELY

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.830
IF HE RESPECTS A
VERY SIMPLE RULE.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.600
AVOID OVER
EXPLOITATION.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.060
BUT IT HAPPENS.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.560
INDUSTRIAL FISHING IS
BREAKING ALL BARRIERS.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.500
FISHING IS AT AN ALL
TIME HIGH AND THE LOSSES

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.230
SUSTAINED THUS FAR
CANNOT BE RECUPERATED.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.200
EXCESSIVE FISHING USES
UP EXISTING RESOURCES.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.960
THE SMALLER
THE POPULATION,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.000
THE SMALLER THEIR
CAPACITY TO REPRODUCE.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.060
THIS IS WHAT IS GOING
ON IN OUR OCEANS.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.960
EXCESSIVE FISHING IS
CAUSING A TOTAL COLLAPSE,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.500
A DISAPPEARANCE OF WELL
KNOWN SPECIES SUCH AS

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.830
COD, RED TUNA,
OR HAKE.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.060
SINCE THE ADVENT OF
MODERN REFRIGERATION

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.430
IN CARGO PLANES IT
HAS BECOME POSSIBLE

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.660
TO TRANSPORT
PERISHABLE ARTICLES

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.130
IN VERY LITTLE TIME,
AND BECAUSE OF THIS,

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.230
FISH PRODUCTS HAVE
BECOME COMMERCIALIZED

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.200
AT A WORLD LEVEL.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.060
IN WHOLESALE MARKETS
IT'S POSSIBLE TO BUY FISH

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.500
THAT WAS CAPTURED
JUST 48 HOURS EARLIER

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.230
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE PLANET.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.760
AS A CONSEQUENCE
OF THIS

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.900
DEMAND HAS
DRASTICALLY INCREASED,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.560
A GROWTH IN SUPPLY AND
DEMAND THAT IS OBLIVIOUS

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.200
TO THE REAL CAPACITIES
OF SUSTAINED PRODUCTION.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.100
A LARGE PART OF
THE FISH IMPORTED BY

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.300
INDUSTRIALIZED
NATIONS COMES FROM

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.730
THE WATERS OF
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.430
EUROPEAN NATIONS IMPORT HALF
OF THE FISH THEY CONSUME.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.660
THIS IS THE REASON
WHY FOR MANY YEARS

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.900
THE EUROPEAN UNION
NEGOTIATES FISHING DEALS

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:43.560
IN ORDER TO CONSERVE
ITS OWN RESOURCES.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.230
THE EU HAS FISHING ACCORDS
WITH 15 NATIONS IN AFRICA,

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.930
THE CARIBBEAN, AND
THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.560
THESE DEALS ARE USUALLY
SEALED IN EXCHANGE FOR

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.960
ECONOMIC COMPENSATION.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.660
THE CONSEQUENCES OF
EXCESSIVE FISHING ARE

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.360
USUALLY PAID BY FISHERMEN
IN POOR COUNTRIES.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.000
THIS IS A DIRECT
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.160
OVER EXPLOITATION
AND POVERTY.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.660
MAURITANIA IS A
CLEAR EXAMPLE.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.000
THE WEALTH OF FISH IN ITS
WATERS HAS FED FISHERMEN

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.560
AND THEIR FAMILIES
FOR GENERATIONS.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.960
TODAY, HOWEVER, ITS
COASTS ARE EXPLOITED BY

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:03.900
INDUSTRIAL FISHERIES,
BOTH LEGAL AND ILLEGAL.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.660
THE NORTHERN FRINGE OF
THE SEA OF MAURITANIA

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.860
OFF THE COAST OF SAHEL
WAS UNTIL NOT TOO LONG AGO

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.930
ONE OF THE RICHEST
AREAS IN THE WORLD

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.100
IN TERMS OF
MARINE LIFE.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.800
OVER THE LAST
THREE DECADES,

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.960
HUGE JAPANESE,
RUSSIAN, AND EUROPEAN

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.200
FISH FARMS HAVE
DEPLETED THESE WATERS

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:27.400
WITH THE BLESSINGS
OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.100
LARGE CARGO SHIPS
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.460
DEVASTATE THE
AFRICAN COAST.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.130
AT THE SAME TIME, AND
IN FIERCE COMPETITION

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.500
WITH THEM, THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE MAKE A LIVING

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.800
BY FISHING IN THE
TRADITIONAL WAY.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.830
IT IS AN
UNEVEN BATTLE.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:07.160
THE PORT OF NOUAKCHOTT
IS ONE OF THE HUBS OF

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.330
OLD FASHIONED FISHING ON
THE WEST AFRICAN COAST.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.330
IT IS A UNIVERSE UNTO
ITSELF - A WORLD OF MEN

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.830
WHO WORK TOGETHER,
WITHOUT OUTSIDE HELP,

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:23.760
COLLABORATING IN THEIR
OWN SEA ADVENTURE.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.900
ALONG THE NORTHERN
COAST OF MAURITANIA

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.930
THERE ARE MANY
COMMUNITIES OF FISHERMEN.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.600
MOST OF THEM HAVE BEEN
THE ONLY INHABITANTS

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.260
OF THESE LANDS
FOR CENTURIES.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.560
THE IMRAGUEN PEOPLE
HAVE LIVED ALONG

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.760
THE MAURITANIAN
COASTLINE FOREVER.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.060
THEY ALSO LIVE AMONGST
THE CONTRADICTIONS

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.500
OF MODERN-DAY LIFE.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.930
THEY'RE PROTECTED BY
NATURAL RESERVE LAWS,

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.330
YET IT IS THOSE VERY
LAWS THAT DENY THEM

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.660
THE ABILITY
TO PROGRESS.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.800
TODAY THERE ARE 800
IMRAGUEN LIVING IN

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.500
ARGUIN BANC
NATIONAL PARK.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.360
THEY HAVE WOKEN
UP EARLY TODAY

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.400
TO FISH THEIR
DAILY SUSTENANCE.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.560
THE ONLY MEANS
BY WHICH THEY ARE

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.600
ALLOWED TO SURVIVE
IS BY FISHING...

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.600
AND ONLY UNDER
VERY STRICT RULES.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.260
THE IMRAGUEN EMPLOY VERY
TRADITIONAL FISHING METHODS.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.300
ONCE THEY REACH
THE SHORELINE,

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.760
THE MEN SEARCH FOR
A BANK OF FISH.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.800
THEY WORK DISCREETLY,
SILENTLY, AMBUSHING

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.200
THEIR PREY LIKE VERITABLE
MARITIME FELINES.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.330
THE MEN FORM
GROUPS OF SIX.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.600
THREE OF THEM CARRY
NETS IN THE WATER

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.660
WHILE THE OTHER THREE
DO THE SAME ON THE SHORE.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.800
THEY'VE SPOTTED A
LARGE GROUP OF MULLETS

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.160
AND THEY SILENTLY
CLOSE IN,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:24.160
ENSURING THAT THEY WON'T
ESCAPE TO DEEPER WATERS.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.530
WHEN THEY'RE SUFFICIENTLY
CLOSE AND WHILE THE MEN IN

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.760
THE WATER SURROUND THE
FISH, THE SHORE KEEPERS

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.300
POUND THE WATER TO DRIVE
THEM TOWARDS THE NETS.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.900
IT HAS TO BE DONE
QUICKLY AND IN COMPLETE

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.100
COORDINATION, ENSURING
THAT THE FISHES' ONLY

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.560
CHOICE IS TO HEAD TOWARDS
THEIR NYLON ENCLOSURE.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.830
IMRAGUEN HAVE ALWAYS
FISHED THIS WAY

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.530
- FROM THE SHORELINE.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.600
THE USE OF SMALL
SAILBOATS IS RECENT

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.900
AND IT WAS INTRODUCED
BY SAILORS FROM THE

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:56.130
CANARY ISLANDS TOWARDS THE
END OF THE 19TH CENTURY.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:58.830
THERE'S AN OLD LEGEND THAT
WAS FURTHER PROPAGATED

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.860
BY NATURALIST JACQUES
COUSTEAU WHICH STATES THAT

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.200
THE IMRAGUEN EMPLOYED
DOLPHINS TO HELP THEM

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.730
CAPTURE THEIR FISH.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.760
ACCORDING TO THE
LEGEND, MAN AND DOLPHIN

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.160
COMMUNICATE THROUGH
A SECRET LANGUAGE.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.300
THE DOLPHINS RECEIVE
THEIR ORDERS FROM MAN

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.730
AND DIRECT FISH
TOWARDS THE NETS.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.230
UNFORTUNATELY THIS
IS ONLY A LEGEND.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.400
THERE ARE MANY DOLPHINS IN
THIS REGION AND IT IS TRUE

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.300
THAT FISHERMEN USE THEM TO
LOCATE LARGE SCHOOLS OF FISH,

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.160
BUT THAT IS THE EXTENT
OF THEIR COLLABORATION.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.400
THE IMRAGUEN USUALLY
CAPTURE MULLET

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.400
BECAUSE THEY MOVE
IN LARGE GROUPS

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.300
AND STAY CLOSE
TO THE SHORELINE.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.600
HOWEVER, IT IS NOT A
GREAT PRIZE FISH FOR THEM

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.100
SINCE THEY HAVE LITTLE VALUE
IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.660
AND CAN BE SOLD ONLY TO
SMALL INTERNAL MARKETS

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:09.330
SO THEY'RE USED MAINLY
FOR THEIR OWN CONSUMPTION.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:13.200
THE IMRAGUEN SEEM TO
LIVE IN A TIME CAPSULE

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.000
IN AN IDYLLIC UNIVERSE.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.730
BUT NOTHING COULD BE
FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.600
BEHIND THIS
UTOPIAN APPEARANCE

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.430
LIES A MORE
TROUBLED TRUTH.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.700
THE IMRAGUEN ARE NOT
IMMUNE TO THE PROBLEMS

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.660
OF FISHERMEN IN THE
REST OF THE WORLD.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.760
HOW CAN THEIR
RIGHT TO DEVELOP

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.060
BE RECONCILED WITH
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS?

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.800
THEY'RE ALSO NOT IMMUNE TO
THE DILEMMA OF COMBINING

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.600
ANCIENT TRADITIONS WITH
MODERN-DAY CHALLENGES.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.300
IS IT POSSIBLE TO
ADAPT TO PROGRESS

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.000
WITH A SENSE OF RESPECT
FOR THEIR IDENTITY

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.830
WHILE MAINTAINING THEIR RIGHT
TO CONSERVE THEIR CULTURE

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:51.400
AND AT THE SAME TIME
MEET HUMANITY'S NEED

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.830
FOR CULTURES
TO BE PRESERVED?

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.900
IMRAGUEN FACE UNFAIR
COMPETITION IN THEIR

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.100
DAILY FIGHT
FOR SURVIVAL.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.600
THEY CANNOT
USE MOTORBOATS,

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.000
BUT NOBODY PROHIBITS
FOREIGN MOTOR VESSELS

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.960
FROM ENTERING
PROTECTED WATERS

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.760
AND DOING EVERYTHING
THAT THEY CANNOT.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.060
THEY'RE COMPLETELY BOUND
BECAUSE THEY'RE DENIED

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.730
THE POSSIBILITY TO PROGRESS
WHILE THEIR FISH DISAPPEAR

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.030
BECAUSE NOBODY
CONTROLS THE LARGE

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:22.860
INTERNATIONAL VESSELS
THAT MAKE THEM DISAPPEAR.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.630
NORMALLY A FISHING OUTING
DOESN'T GO PAST NOON.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.300
AS THEY HEAD BACK HOME,
NAVIGATING IN THE CALM

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.900
AND SHALLOW WATERS
OF THE ARGUIN BANC,

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:49.400
THEY PREPARE THE
FOOD THEMSELVES.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:59.460
(SINGING)

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:22.560
(SINGING)

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.030
THIS SITUATION
DOESN'T ONLY AFFECT

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.830
DEVELOPING NATIONS.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.030
MANY CONSUMERS ARE UNAWARE
OF THE GRAVE CRISIS

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:49.360
THAT THREATENS FISH
AS A SOURCE OF FOOD.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.030
BUT WE HAVE
REACHED OUR LIMIT.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.760
THERE ARE ALREADY
MORE BOATS THAN FISH.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.860
ONLY IN EUROPE THERE'S
A SURPLUS OF 40%.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.430
THIS BUSINESS HAS BECOME
VERY UNPROFITABLE,

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.230
EVEN FOR LARGE
FISHING COMPANIES.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:07.430
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS: THE
INDUSTRY LOCATES AN AREA

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.600
THAT ATTRACTS AN
INCREASING NUMBER

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.030
OF FISHING VESSELS.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.400
FOR SOME TIME
BUSINESS FLOURISHES

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.800
AND THE VOLUME OF FISH
CAPTURED REACHES A PEAK.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.730
THE WATERS ARE EXPLOITED
WITHOUT ANY CONTROLS,

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.300
WITHOUT ALLOWING FOR THE
REGENERATION OF SPECIES.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:30.430
THUS POPULATIONS DECLINE,
MAKING WORK MUCH HARDER.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:35.060
UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO,
WHEN THIS HAPPENED

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.500
ANOTHER FISH RICH
AREA WAS FOUND.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.530
BUT THERE ARE NO
MORE LEFT TO EXPLOIT.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.960
NOW BOATS SPEND LONGER
TIME EXPLOITING THE

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.700
WATERS' RESOURCES, AND IN
ORDER TO AVOID LOSSES,

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:52.360
EVEN THE LAST
SPECIES IS TAKEN.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.930
SCIENTISTS FROM THE
INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.800
FOR THE EXPLORATION OF
THE SEA HAVE FOR YEARS

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.730
BEEN RECOMMENDING,
FOR INSTANCE,

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.200
THAT COD NOT BE FISHED
IN THE NORTH SEA

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.100
OR RED TUNA IN THE
MEDITERRANEAN SEA.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.800
THESE POPULATIONS HAVE
BEEN SO DRASTICALLY

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.760
REDUCED THAT THEY'RE IN
DANGER OF BECOMING EXTINCT.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.200
MANY DON'T REACH MATURITY,
AND BECAUSE OF THIS

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.360
BIRTH RATES AMONG THESE
SPECIES IS VERY LOW.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.830
IN ORDER TO SAVE THEM,
THE ONLY POSSIBILITY

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.800
IS TO FORBID THEIR
CAPTURE - A SOLUTION

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:34.500
THAT IS FAR FROM
BEING IMPLEMENTED.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.700
ANOTHER DANGER THAT
THREATENS SEA LIFE

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.860
IS THE PROLIFERATION
OF ILLEGAL FISHING.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.900
THIS IS CARRIED OUT BY
VESSELS THAT DO NOT SAIL

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.860
UNDER THEIR HOME FLAG.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.700
THESE VESSELS TEND TO
SAIL UNDER SO-CALLED

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.700
"CONVENIENCE" FLAGS,
SUCH AS THOSE OF BELIZE,

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.430
HONDURAS, OR
ST. VINCENT.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.460
THEY FISH IN REMOTE REGIONS
THAT ARE HARD TO CONTROL.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.100
IT IS PRACTICALLY
IMPOSSIBLE TO PROTECT

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.830
FISHING RESOURCES OR TO
EXPLOIT SAID RESOURCES

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.660
IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER
WHEN ILLEGAL FISHING

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.930
AND A LACK OF FISHING
CONTROLS TAKES PLACE.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.130
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT
FOR SOME SPECIES

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.130
ILLEGAL FISHING
ACCOUNTS FOR A THIRD

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.930
OF THE VOLUME OF
WHAT IS CAPTURED.

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.660
THUS ILLEGAL FISHING
IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.630
FOR OVER EXPLOITATION.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.630
THESE VESSELS AVOID
CONTROLS AND VIOLATE

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.260
FISHING AGREEMENTS BECAUSE
THE COUNTRIES THAT ALLOW

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.730
THEM TO CONDUCT THEIR
ACTIVITIES DO NOT RATIFY

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.360
THE NECESSARY ACCORDS OR
CONVENTIONS AND DO NOT

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.330
EXERCISE ANY CONTROL
OVER THEIR OWN FLEETS.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.960
QUITE OFTEN THE TRUE
OWNERS OF THESE VESSELS

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.260
LIVE IN JAPAN,
THE UNITED STATES,

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.600
OR IN EU COUNTRIES.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.260
THE AFRICAN COAST IS
AN EXAMPLE OF WASTE

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.560
AND OVER EXPLOITATION.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.830
NEAR THE AFRICAN HORN IN
DJIBOUTI, LOCAL FISHERMEN

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:35.130
HAVE FOREVER FISHED
IN ORDER TO SURVIVE.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.430
THE PARENTS AND
GRANDPARENTS

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.500
OF THESE FISHERMEN
WERE PEARL DIVERS.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.260
FOR CENTURIES RED SEA
PEARLS WERE HIGHLY PRIZED

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.500
IN THE ORIENT.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.630
ENTIRE FAMILIES
DIVED FOR PEARLS

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.900
THAT THEY THEMSELVES
SOLD TO MIDDLEMEN

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.800
WHO ARRIVED BY BOAT
FROM JAPAN AND INDIA.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.800
A FEW YEARS AGO THE
GOVERNMENT GRANTED

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.830
A FRENCH MONOPOLY
SOLE CONCESSION

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.030
OVER PEARL DIVING
AND BECAUSE OF THIS

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:39.300
LOCAL DIVERS WERE FORCED
TO REINVENT THEMSELVES.

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.560
MANY STOPPED DIVING AND
EMIGRATED TO CITIES,

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.000
WHILE OTHERS BEGAN FISHING
FOR LOBSTERS AND SOLD THEM

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.800
TO RESORT HOTELS ON
DJIBOUTAN BEACHES.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.660
THEY USUALLY
FISH NEAR MOUCHA,

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.700
ONE OF THE MOST
TOURISTIC ISLANDS.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.330
THESE ISLANDS WERE ONCE
A REFUGE FOR PIRATES

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.300
AND CONTRABAND DEALERS.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.900
TODAY THEY ARE NATURAL
RESERVES WITH MANGROVES

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.000
AND CORALS THAT
ARE SAFEGUARDED

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.030
AS IF THEY WERE THE
REAL TREASURE ISLAND.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.000
HUNTING FOR SHARK
IS MORE TRADITIONAL

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.900
THAN FISHING
FOR LOBSTER.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.700
GULF WATERS ARE RICH IN
RESOURCES SUCH AS SHARK

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.600
WHICH HAVE A
HIGH MARKET VALUE

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.330
IF THEY'RE
SOLD IN PARTS.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:54.460
SHARK FISHING USUALLY
TAKES PLACE AROUND

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.600
THE ISLANDS OF
THE SEVEN BROTHERS,

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.500
WHICH BOASTS SOME OF THE
MOST BEAUTIFUL SCENERY

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.830
IN ALL OF DJIBOUTI.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:05.930
THEIR NAME STEMS FROM AN
IMPORTANT LEGEND TO THE

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.000
LOCALS WHICH TELLS OF
SEVEN TERRIBLE FOREIGNERS

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.360
WHO FOR MANY YEARS
ASSAULTED BOATS AND LOCAL

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:19.100
POPULATIONS THROUGHOUT
THE YEMENITE COAST.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:24.500
THESE PIRATES WERE
BROTHERS AND IN THEIR PATH

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.830
NOT A SINGLE SETTLEMENT
WAS LEFT IN WHICH THE

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:33.200
LOCAL WOMEN WERE NOT RAPED
NOR PROPERTY PLUNDERED.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.730
NONE OF THE SULTANS THAT
GOVERNED THESE TERRITORIES

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.930
HAD THE POWER TO STOP
THESE SIBLING PIRATES.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.330
THEY MOVED ABOUT IN SMALL
VESSELS, ATTACKING AND

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:45.700
DISAPPEARING LIKE TRUE
ASSAULT COMMANDOS.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.530
ONLY THE FORCES OF
NATURE COULD STOP THEM.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.900
ONE NIGHT AS
THEY SAILED,

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.430
A TERRIBLE STORM SURPRISED
THEM ON THESE COASTS.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.900
THE VENGEFUL
FORCE OF THE WINDS

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:02.230
TURNED THE SEVEN BROTHERS
INTO SEVEN ISLANDS.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:04.760
NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR
BEAUTY, THIS AREA IS

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.300
ONE OF THE MOST
TEMPEST-RIDDEN OF THE GULF

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.030
IN WHICH STRONG GALES
AND STORMS ARE THE NORM.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.600
THE SEVEN BROTHERS
WERE FOREVER CONDEMNED

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:20.660
TO BEING POUNDED BY
STRONG, RELENTLESS WAVES.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:10.730
THESE ARE GREAT WATERS,
THOUGH, FOR SHARK FISHING.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:17.360
SHARKS ARE NOT EASY TO
CATCH, FOR THEY REQUIRE

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.630
PATIENCE AND STRENGTH
IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.330
REACH THE SURFACE.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:59.400
A SHARK IS
COMPLETELY USED UP.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.130
THE BEST SHARK MEAT
COMES FROM THE YOUNGEST

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.900
OF THE SPECIES.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.200
ITS SKIN IS USED AS
SANDPAPER AND ITS TEETH,

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.600
IF THEY'RE BIG ENOUGH,
ARE SOLD TO TOURISTS.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.860
BUT WITHOUT A DOUBT
THE MOST COVETED PRIZE

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:13.360
IS ITS FIN WHICH
IS KEPT AND SOLD TO

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.130
ASIAN BUSINESSMEN AT
EXORBITANT PRICES.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.560
THE SICKNESS OF OUR WATERS
IS NOT ONLY A CONSEQUENCE

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.360
OF OVER EXPLOITATION.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.030
ONE THIRD OF ALL MARINE
LIFE CAPTURED IN FISHING

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.860
NETS OF INDUSTRIAL FISHING
INTERESTS ARE ACCESSORY -

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.460
UNWANTED, TOO SMALL, OR
SIMPLY STRAY SPECIES

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:51.400
SUCH AS TURTLES, SEA BIRDS,
SEALS, OR DOLPHINS.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.930
MILLIONS OF TONS OF
SUCH LIVING BEINGS

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.130
ARE JETTISONED
AND LEFT TO DIE.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:21.560
FOR EVERY TON OF SOLE THAT
IS FISHED, 11 MILLION TONS

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.400
OF SO-CALLED "ACCESSORY"
SPECIES ARE CAPTURED.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.360
FISHING ONE TON OF SHRIMP
ENTAILS THE KILLING

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.530
OF UP TO 15 TONS
OF OTHER SPECIES.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.700
THIS IS THE RESULT
OF NON-SELECTIVE

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.260
FISHING TECHNIQUES.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.260
THE HUGE SPAN OF THE NETS
USED IN DEEP SEA FISHING

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.730
USUALLY DRAGS IN ANYTHING
THAT CROSSES ITS PATH.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:44.760
THE USE OF TRAWL
NETS OR GILL NETS

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.860
IS PARTICULARLY
IRRESPONSIBLE.

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.060
THEY ACT AS INVISIBLE
CURTAINS THAT FLOAT

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.160
IN THE WATER AND
ARE IMPERCEPTIBLE

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.230
TO MARINE MAMMALS
AND OTHER ANIMALS

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.060
THAT STRAY
NEAR THE SURFACE.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.330
THOSE NETS STAY AFLOAT
AND ARE POSITIONED BY

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:02.400
MARINE CURRENTS
OR WIND.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.300
ALTHOUGH THE USE OF
NETS THAT ARE MORE THAN

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.530
TWO AND A HALF KILOMETERS
WIDE IS ILLEGAL,

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.100
NETS OF UP TO 50
KILOMETERS WIDE ARE

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:17.460
PERMANENTLY FLOATING ADRIFT
IN OUR SEAS AND OCEANS.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.460
THESE GILL NETS AND TRAWL
NETS CONSTITUTE A MAJOR

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.860
THREAT BECAUSE OF THE
UNCONTROLLED CAPTURE

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.860
OF ACCESSORY SPECIES.

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.600
LONG LINE FISHING
IS ALSO A PROBLEM.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.360
IT IS A VERY COMMON
TECHNIQUE THAT CONSISTS OF

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.200
A LONG LINE, SOMETIMES
REACHING MANY KILOMETERS

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.500
IN LENGTH, TO WHICH
THOUSANDS OF HOOKS ARE TIED.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.560
AND IT IS ALSO
ANOTHER PERPETRATOR

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:46.030
OF UNWANTED KILLINGS OF
MARINE TURTLES OR BIRDS.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.300
DRIFT NETS ALSO
GRAVELY ENDANGER

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.730
THE MARINE ECOSYSTEM.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.600
14TH CENTURY ENGLISH
FISHERMEN MANIFESTED

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.100
THEIR PREOCCUPATION FOR
THE EFFECTS OF THE NETS

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.000
THEY USED ON SEA BEDS.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.700
THREE CENTURIES LATER
THEIR DUTCH COLLEAGUES

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.460
WENT AS FAR AS DEMANDING
THAT THE USE OF DRIFT NETS

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.200
BE CURTAILED BECAUSE
THIS TECHNIQUE DIMINISHED

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.930
THEIR CAPACITY TO
FISH EFFECTIVELY.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.230
THESE NETS PLOW THE
SEA BEDS THEY COME INTO

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:25.400
CONTACT WITH, UNCOVERING
ORGANISMS USED TO LIVING

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:29.830
UNDERGROUND AND BURYING
OTHERS THAT ARE NOT.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.600
THE USE OF POISONS SUCH
AS CYANIDE AND EXPLOSIVES

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.460
SUCH AS DYNAMITE ARE AMONG
OTHER LARGE SCALE FISHING

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.930
TECHNIQUES AND TAKE PLACE
MAINLY IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.230
CONSEQUENCES OF
THESE TECHNIQUES ARE

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.830
NON-SELECTIVE DEATH OF
MANY SPECIES OF FISH,

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.530
THE DESTRUCTION OF
CORAL REEFS, AND THUS

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.830
THE BASIS FOR
SUSTAINABLE FISHING.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.360
BECAUSE OF THE SLOW GROWTH
OF CORAL REEFS, WHICH

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.860
CONSTITUTE THE HABITAT
OF MANY SPECIES OF FISH,

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.660
MANY OF THESE FISH
MIGRATE TO OTHER REEFS

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.660
THAT HAVE NOT YET
BEEN DESTROYED.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.930
MANY ARE THE WAYS
THAT MAN HAS DEVISED

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:30.300
TO DESTROY THE SEA.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.600
AND THERE SEEMS TO
BE NO END IN SIGHT.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.260
THE OCEANS AND THE
COASTS SEEM TO BE SUBJECT

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.530
TO THE LAW OF THE
JUNGLE, OR AT LEAST

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:42.900
SUBJECT TO LAWS WHICH
ARE BARELY ENFORCED.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.760
TODAY THERE ARE
150 MILLION PEOPLE

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.660
WORKING IN THE FISHING
INDUSTRY OF WHICH 90%

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.930
DO SO IN
DEVELOPING NATIONS,

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:37.730
ESPECIALLY IN
AFRICA AND ASIA.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:40.800
FISHING PROVIDES 20%
OF THE CONSUMPTION

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.900
OF ANIMAL PROTEINS
IN DEVELOPING NATIONS

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:50.200
AND MORE THAN 25%
IN THE POOREST NATIONS.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.360
LOCAL FISHING IS
AN EXAMPLE OF HOW

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.630
CIVIL SOCIETY
AND OTHER NATIONS

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:58.900
CAN SPONTANEOUSLY FIGHT
AGAINST THE ORGANIZATIONS

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:05.960
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.730
IT IS A WAY OF LIFE THAT
IS FAST BECOMING EXTINCT

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:12.630
BUT THAT COULD BE A VIABLE
ALTERNATIVE FOR HUNDREDS

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.330
OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
WHO VIEW EMIGRATION

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:18.400
AS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO
THEIR EXTREME POVERTY.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.330
FISHING COMMUNITIES ARE
USUALLY OVERPOPULATED

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:24.100
AND ARE CHARACTERIZED
BY THEIR PRECARIOUS

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.830
LIVING CONDITIONS.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.530
THE LITERACY LEVEL IS
LOW SINCE THEY HAVE FEW

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:31.560
BASIC SERVICES SUCH AS
ACCESS TO EDUCATION

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.130
AND BASIC HEALTH CARE.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.300
THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM
IS THAT LOCAL FISHERMEN

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.400
DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS
TO FISH RICH AREAS.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.760
THE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN
THEIR GOVERNMENTS AND THE

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.900
WORLD POWERS HAS LEFT THEM
LITTLE CHANCE FOR SURVIVAL.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.830
THEIR WORLD IS
DISAPPEARING BUT

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:50.400
THEY HAVE NO ALTERNATE
SOURCES OF EMPLOYMENT

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.830
AND MANY OF THEM
DON'T EVEN OWN

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:57.200
THE PROPERTY
THEY LIVE ON.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:02.760
FISHING IS ONE OF THE MOST
DANGEROUS OCCUPATIONS

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.300
IN THE WORLD, WHICH
MEANS THAT THE FEW GOODS

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.630
THAT FAMILIES OWN
- BOATS AND GEAR -

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:13.960
ARE CONSTANTLY IN PERIL.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:17.060
THE LOSS OF AN ACTIVE
MEMBER OF A FAMILY DUE TO

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:22.000
SICKNESS OR DISABILITY
COULD SPELL DISASTER.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.100
UNTIL JUST A FEW YEARS
AGO, THESE SMALL BOATS

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.800
DID NOT TRAVEL PAST 15
OR 20 MILES FROM THE COAST.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.930
TRAVELING 100 MILES FROM
THE COAST WAS CONSIDERED

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:37.060
AN ODYSSEY; A RARE FEAT
FOR LOCAL FISHERMEN.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.860
COMPETITION AMONG LARGE
INTERNATIONAL VESSELS

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.730
HAS FORCED THEM TO
TAKE MORE RISKS.

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:45.930
TODAY LOCAL FISHERMEN
TRAVEL UP TO 400, 500,

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:48.160
AND 600 MILES
FROM THE COAST.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.830
THEY RISK THEIR LIVES
IN SEARCH OF FISH.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.800
THE POVERTY AND
VULNERABILITY OF THE

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.960
FISHING COMMUNITIES
COMBINED WITH OTHER

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.760
FACTORS SUCH AS THEIR
HIGH DEGREE OF MOBILITY

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.760
EXPOSES THEM TO
OTHER PROBLEMS.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.460
FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL
ORGANIZATION STUDIES SHOW

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.530
THAT FISHING COMMUNITIES
OF MANY DEVELOPING NATIONS

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.700
IN AFRICA, ASIA,
AND CENTRAL AMERICA

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:16.330
HAVE BETWEEN FIVE AND
14 TIMES MORE CASES OF

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:20.730
HIV INFECTIONS THAN THE
REST OF THE POPULATION.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.900
BESIDES THIS HUMAN COST,
POVERTY AMONG FISHERMEN

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.500
MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR
THEM TO ADEQUATELY MARKET

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.230
THE FRUITS
OF THEIR LABOR.

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:32.560
THIS WILL NOT IMPROVE UNTIL
MORE EFFORTS ARE MADE

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:38.060
TO COMBAT POVERTY
AMONG FISHERMEN.

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.300
POOR PEOPLE CANNOT DEFEND
THEIR LONG TERM INTERESTS

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:45.830
OR ACCESS FISH RICH AREAS
IN THEIR OWN WATERS.

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.900
THE SOLUTION IS
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT.

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.600
GREATER INVESTMENTS IN
EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.960
WILL NOT ONLY HELP
TO COMBAT POVERTY

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.460
AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS
BUT WILL GREATER EASE

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:10.360
FISHING
RELATED PROBLEMS.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.860
TO FIND AN EFFICIENT
SOLUTION TO POVERTY

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.700
AND TO THE SOCIAL PROBLEMS
OF FISHING COMMUNITIES

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:20.530
IS ONE OF THE MORE PRESSING
PROBLEMS OF OUR AGE.

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:59.160
ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES
DESIGNED TO AVOID THE

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.600
DISAPPEARANCE OF CERTAIN
COMMERCIAL FISH SPECIES

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.200
IS THE INDUSTRIAL
FISH FARM.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.000
THESE ARE MARINE FARMS
IN WHICH FISH ARE BRED

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.660
IN LARGE AMOUNTS
AND VERY QUICKLY.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.930
A SOLUTION? IT DOES
SATISFY MARKET DEMAND,

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:20.400
BUT IT IS NOT A
SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.500
IN ORDER TO BUILD FISH
FARMS IN ASIA, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.100
AMPLE SECTIONS OF
CORAL REEFS AND MANGROVES

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.400
WERE ELIMINATED.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.700
AND NOT ONLY WAS THE
ENVIRONMENT DESTROYED,

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.730
IN MANY CASES EVEN LOCAL
COMMUNITIES WERE DISPLACED

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:36.830
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE
PURITY OF FARM WATERS.

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:38.960
THE BREEDING PROCESS
IS INTENSIVE.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.560
ANIMAL FEED IS USED
TO FEED THE FISH

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.330
AS WELL AS CHEMICAL
FERTILIZERS AND ANTIBIOTICS

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:46.160
IN ORDER TO AVOID
EPIDEMICS FROM

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.500
DOING AWAY WITH
A CROP OF FISH.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.730
THE RESULTS ARE THE
BREEDING OF LOWER

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:55.660
QUALITY FISH AND PERMANENT
DAMAGE TO THE COAST.

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.560
DUE TO THE PROLIFERATION
OF FISH FARMS,

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.660
AMONG OTHER FACTORS,
THE PROCESS OF

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.160
COASTAL DESTRUCTION
IS QUITE ADVANCED.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.960
INDIA POSSESSES ONLY
30% OF WHAT IT HAD

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.500
THREE DECADES AGO.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.860
AND IN INDONESIA IN SOME
ISLANDS 70% OF THE COAST

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:24.760
HAS ALREADY
BEEN DESTROYED.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:29.530
FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL
ORGANIZATION DATA

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:32.200
SHOWS THAT WE CANNOT
CAPTURE MORE THAN

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.430
100 MILLION TONS
OF EXPLOITED SPECIES

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:38.600
WITHOUT DAMAGING
FISH RICH SEA BEDS.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.530
BUT DEMAND IS
MUCH GREATER.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:42.660
ONE OF THE SHORT
TERM SOLUTIONS

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.530
IS MODERATE
AQUACULTURE.

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:46.830
THAT IS, BREEDING
FISH IN CAGES, TANKS,

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:48.400
OR MARINE CELLS.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:52.630
IT IS A POSSIBILITY BUT WE
MUST BE AWARE OF THE RISKS.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:55.300
FISH FARMS ARE THE GREAT
BET FOR THE FUTURE.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.860
GENEROUS PUBLIC INCENTIVES
HAVE STIMULATED THEIR

00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.900
PROLIFERATION ALL
OVER THE WORLD.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.700
BECAUSE OF THIS, THE
DEMAND FOR FISH FLOUR HAS

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.400
RISEN, WHICH IS USED TO
MAKE THE ANIMAL FEED

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.600
TO FEED THE FISH BORN
AND BRED IN CAPTIVITY.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.800
THIS FLOUR IS ALSO
MADE UP OF KRILL

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.100
AND SMALL CRUSTACEANS
THAT LIVE IN THE OCEAN.

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.130
THIS UNSTOPPABLE RISE IN
AQUACULTURE WILL ENTAIL

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:20.830
AN EVER-INCREASING RISE
IN THE CAPTURE OF KRILL

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:23.360
AND CRUSTACEANS IN
ORDER TO TEND TO THE

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.930
INCREASING DEMAND FOR
FISH FLOUR ANIMAL FEED.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:29.400
AN UNCONTROLLED INCREASE
IN THEIR CAPTURE COULD

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.630
ENDANGER THE SURVIVAL OF
WHALES, SEALS, AND OTHER

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:43.000
ANIMALS THAT FEED OFF
THIS MARINE RESOURCE.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.560
FISH FARMS COULD BE
ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS,

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.800
BUT WE ARE STILL
FAR FROM MAKING THEM

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.830
COMPATIBLE WITH
ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS.

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:55.200
ANOTHER GREAT
CHALLENGE LIES AHEAD.

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:34.660
ON THE INDONESIAN COAST ON
THE ISLAND OF SULAWESI,

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.800
THE BADJAO PEOPLE
MAKE THEIR HOME.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.400
THE BADJAO ARE NOMADS
THAT LIVE AND DIE

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.300
ON THEIR LIGHT CANOES.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.030
THEY FEEL FREE ON THE
OCEAN AND IT IS THE OCEAN

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:47.660
THAT GIVES
THEM EVERYTHING.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.200
THE WOOD THEIR CANOES
ARE MADE FROM IS AS HARD

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.560
AS STEEL AND THEY
CAN LAST A LIFETIME.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.700
A WHOLE FAMILY
LIVES INSIDE.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.160
COOKING IS DONE
IN THE STERN.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.260
THE ROOMS AND PANTRY
ARE IN THE MIDDLE,

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:03.160
AND IN THE BOW,
THE LIVING ROOM.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.930
THE BADJAO NEVER DRIFT
TOO FAR FROM THE COAST.

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:35.330
THEY ALWAYS STAY CLOSE TO
CORAL REEFS AND MANGROVES.

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:38.600
MANGROVES ARE VITAL TO THE
BALANCE OF THE ECOSYSTEM.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.000
THEY CREATE A BARRIER
BETWEEN THE WATER AND LAND

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
THAT AVOIDS EROSION.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.030
WHAT'S MORE, THEIR ROOTS
PROVIDE HAVEN FOR HUNDREDS

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:49.430
OF ORGANISMS THAT
IN TURN PROVIDE FOOD

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:52.500
FOR OTHER ANIMALS
AS WELL AS FOR MAN.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:57.300
THEY ALSO LIKE TO NAVIGATE
ON LARGE SEAWEED BANKS.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:00.500
SEAWEED ARE THE
BADJAO'S CALENDAR.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.330
ON THE THIRD DAY OF
EACH MONTH THEY OPEN UP

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:06.300
AND THEY DO SO AGAIN ON
TENTH AND THE FIFTEENTH.

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.700
FROM THE SIXTEENTH
TO THE TWENTIETH

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.430
THEY REMAIN CLOSED, AND
FROM THE TWENTIETH ON,

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:15.330
THEIR COLOR
IS VERY INTENSE.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:36.660
BUT THE REASON THEY'RE
KNOWN AS A CREATIVE PEOPLE

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.430
IS BECAUSE OF THEIR
KITE FISHING TECHNIQUE

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.900
WHICH IS QUITE SIMPLE
AND VERY EFFICIENT.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.760
A HOOK IS TIED TO A KITE
MADE FROM FERN LEAVES

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.900
AND WITH THE
HELP OF A POLE

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:51.760
THE FISHERMAN CAN CAST THE
HOOK AS FAR AS HE WANTS TO.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.560
THE MOVEMENT OF
THE KITE ENSURES

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.530
THAT THE HOOK
IS ALWAYS MOVING,

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:59.260
WHICH ATTRACTS
MAINLY FLYING FISH.

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:12.930
KITE FISHING IS NOT THE
ONLY WAY THEY FISH.

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:17.700
THE BADJAO ARE, MORE THAN
ANYTHING, GREAT DIVERS.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.530
THEY CAN REMAIN UNDER WATER
FOR UP TO FIVE MINUTES

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:25.100
AND CAN REACH DEPTHS
OF UP TO 15 METERS.

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.860
IN ORDER TO DO SO THEY
USE THEIR STOMACH MUSCLES

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.260
TO CONTROL THE
FLOW OF OXYGEN

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:33.930
AND THUS CONTROL THE AIR
THAT LEAVES THEIR LUNGS.

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.700
THE ORIGINS OF THE
BADJAO ARE UNKNOWN,

00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.900
BUT THEY KNOW THAT
THEY'RE NOT ALONE.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.100
OTHERS LIKE THEM LIVE
ALONG THE COASTS

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.460
OF EASTERN ASIA.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.600
THERE ARE SEA FARING
NOMADS IN THE PHILIPPINES,

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.330
THAILAND, BURMA AND
VIETNAM, AND THEY ALL FACE

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:15.230
THE SAME THREATS - SLOW
AND STEADY EXTINCTION.

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:20.430
NOMADS ALL OVER THE
WORLD ARE FALLING VICTIM

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:22.630
TO THE SICKNESS
OF THE OCEAN.

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:24.900
THE WATERS OF EASTERN
SEAS ARE DYING

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.630
DUE TO THE DESTRUCTION.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.530
HOTEL RESORTS
AND FISH FARMS

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:30.200
ARE BEING
CREATED EVERYWHERE.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.060
AND FORESTS ARE
BEING DESTROYED,

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:35.400
CAUSING UNPRECEDENTED
EROSION.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:38.160
CORAL REEFS AND MANGROVES
ARE DISAPPEARING,

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:42.100
FURTHER IMPOVERISHING
SMALL FISHING COMMUNITIES.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.730
MANY BADJAO HAVE MOVED TO
PERMANENT SETTLEMENTS.

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:43.760
THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT
BUILT HOUSES FOR THEM

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.100
ON THE COAST BUT THEY
HAVEN'T GOTTEN USED TO

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.430
THE PRESSURE OF LAND
UNDER THEIR FEET.

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:51.330
THEY'VE GONE BACK
TO THE WATER.

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:54.460
AN ALTERNATIVE TO LIVING
ON LAND IS THE TOROSIYI

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:57.230
SETTLEMENT MADE UP OF
LAKE DWELLING LIKE HOMES,

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:59.200
WHICH ARE HALF
WAY BETWEEN CANOES

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:04.160
AND THE SOLIDITY
OF BRICK HOMES.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.300
IN TOROSIYI THE BADJAO
HAVE ELECTRICITY,

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:10.560
A SCHOOL, A HEALTH
CENTER AND A MOSQUE.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.400
FACED WITH THE
PROSPECT OF

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.060
DECREASING
OCEAN RESOURCES,

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:17.360
300 FAMILIES HAVE SETTLED
IN THESE NEW HOMES.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.760
IN A FEW YEARS THERE WILL
BE NO MORE NOMADS LEFT

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.700
ON THE EASTERN COASTS.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.400
IS THIS DEVELOPMENT?

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.660
MAYBE, THOUGH
IF THE OCEAN DIES

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.730
NOT EVEN THEIR NEW
DWELLINGS WILL BE ABLE

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:33.700
TO SAVE THEM FROM
THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION.

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:16.360
LOCAL AND
INDUSTRIAL FISHING

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:19.100
- TWO PERSPECTIVES
OF THE SAME REALITY.

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:22.030
LOCAL FISHERMEN WOULD
NOT BE ABLE TO FEED THE

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:24.600
MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS
OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.360
THAT DEMAND THE
PRODUCTS OF THE OCEAN.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:30.430
BUT NEITHER CAN WE
CONTINUE TO DESTROY

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:34.160
EVERYTHING THAT
GETS IN OUR WAY.

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:48.730
WILL WE BE ABLE TO FIND
MIDDLE GROUND IN THE NEXT

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:51.360
FEW DECADES - A WAY THAT
TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.500
FRUITS OF THE OCEAN
WITHOUT SERIOUSLY

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:58.260
COMPROMISING FUTURE
GENERATIONS?

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.600
THIS IS THE CHALLENGE
THAT LIES BEFORE US

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.660
AND IT IS NO
ORDINARY CHALLENGE,

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:04.700
FOR OUR VERY EXISTENCE

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:12.830
DEPENDS ON OUR
ABILITY TO MEET IT.
