00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:19.200


2
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.270
Sir, your glove.

3
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.770
Not mine; my gloves are on.

4
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.500
Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.

5
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.370
Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:

6
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.930
Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!

7
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.570
Ah, Silvia, Silvia!

8
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.030
Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!

9
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.970
How now, sirrah?

10
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.600
She is not within hearing, sir.

11
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.600
Why, sir, who bade you call her?

12
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.930
Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.

13
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.270
Well, you'll still be too forward.

14
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.070
And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.

15
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.930
Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?

16
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.200
She that your worship loves?

17
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.000
Why, how know you that I am in love?

18
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.770
Marry, by these special marks: first,

19
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.230
you have learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,

20
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.900
like a malecontent; to relish a love-song,

21
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.270
like a robin-redbreast;

22
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.930
to walk alone, like one that had the pestilence;

23
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.670
to sigh, like a school-boy

24
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.570
that had lost his A B C;

25
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.170
to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam;

26
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.470
to fast, like one that takes diet;

27
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.970
to watch like one that fears robbing;

28
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.770
to speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas.

29
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.400
You were wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock;

30
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.870
when you walked, to walk like one of the lions;

31
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.030
when you fasted, it was presently after dinner;

32
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.100
when you looked sadly, it was for want of money:

33
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.530
and now you are metamorphosed with a mistress, that,

34
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.070
when I look on you, I can hardly think you my master.

35
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.830
Are all these things perceived in me?

36
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.430
They are all perceived without ye.

37
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.000
Without me? they cannot.

38
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.070
Without you? nay, that's certain, for,

39
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.630
without you were so simple, none else would:

40
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.130
but you are so without these follies,

41
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.370
that these follies are within you

42
00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.400
and shine through you like the water in an urinal,

43
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.270
that not an eye that sees you but is a physician

44
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.630
to comment on your malady.

45
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.700
But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?

46
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.000
She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?

47
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.870
Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.

48
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.470
Why, sir, I know her not.

49
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.930
Dost thou know her by my gazing on her,

50
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.070
and yet knowest her not?

51
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.830
Is she not hard-favoured, sir?

52
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.170
Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.

53
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.500
Sir, I know that well enough.

54
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.970
What dost thou know?

55
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.600
That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.

56
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.900
I mean that her beauty is exquisite,

57
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.800
but her favour infinite.

58
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.200
That's because the one is painted

59
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.630
and the other out of all count.

60
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.470
How painted? and how out of count?

61
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.130
Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair,

62
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.800
that no man counts of her beauty.

63
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.230
How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.

64
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.370
You never saw her since she was deformed.

65
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.000
How long hath she been deformed?

66
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.600
Ever since you loved her.

67
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.170
I have loved her ever since I saw her;

68
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.900
and still I see her beautiful.

69
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.600
If you love her, you cannot see her.

70
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.670
Why?

71
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.230
Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;

72
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.100
or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have

73
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.930
when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungartered!

74
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.170
What should I see then?

75
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.300
Your own present folly and her passing deformity:

76
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.670
for he, being in love, could not see to garter his hose,

77
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.570
and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.

78
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.170
Belike, boy, then, you are in love;

79
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.000
for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.

80
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.700
True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,

81
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.900
you swinged me for my love,

82
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.830
which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours.

83
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.100
In conclusion, I stand affected to her.

84
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.530
I would you were set, so your affection would cease.

85
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.770
Last night she enjoined me

86
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.530
to write some lines to one she loves.

87
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.330
And have you?

88
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.000
I have.

89
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.200
Are they not lamely writ?

90
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.470
No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!

91
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.000
here she comes.

92
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.230
O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!

93
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.830
Now will he interpret to her.

94
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.870
Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.

95
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.330
O, give ye good even! here's a million of manners.

96
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.000
Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.

97
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.700
He should give her interest and she gives it him.

98
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.670
As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter

99
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.970
Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;

100
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.070
Which I was much unwilling to proceed in

101
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.530
But for my duty to your ladyship.

102
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.170
I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.

103
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.470
Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;

104
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.370
For being ignorant to whom it goes

105
00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.100
I writ at random, very doubtfully.

106
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.170
Perchance you think too much of so much pains?

107
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.430
No, madam; so it stead you, I will write

108
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.670
Please you command, a thousand times as much; And yet--

109
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:14.530
A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;

110
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.700
And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;

111
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.900
And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,

112
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.770
Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.

113
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.000
And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'

114
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.200
What means your ladyship? do you not like it?

115
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:39.870
Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;

116
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.870
But since unwillingly, take them again.

117
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:48.930
Nay, take them.

118
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.630
Madam, they are for you.

119
00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.130
Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;

120
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.930
But I will none of them; they are for you;

121
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.930
I would have had them writ more movingly.

122
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.030
Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.

123
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.930
And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,

124
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:16.800
And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.

125
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.030
If it please me, madam, what then?

126
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:24.400
Why, if it please you, take it for your labour:

127
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:33.770
And so, good morrow, servant.

128
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.270
O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,

129
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.270
As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!

130
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.800
My master sues to her, and she hath taught her suitor,

131
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.230
He being her pupil, to become her tutor.

132
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.730
O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,

133
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.430
That my master, being scribe,

134
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.700
to himself should write the letter?

135
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.430
How now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?

136
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.530
Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.

137
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:57.400
To do what?

138
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.930
To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.

139
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.130
To whom?

140
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.930
To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.

141
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:03.770
What figure?

142
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:04.970
By a letter, I should say.

143
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.270
Why, she hath not writ to me?

144
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.400
What need she, when she hath made you write to yourself?

145
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.930
Why, do you not perceive the jest?

146
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:11.700
No, believe me.

147
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.370
No believing you, indeed, sir.

148
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.700
But did you perceive her earnest?

149
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.500
She gave me none, except an angry word.

150
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.600
Why, she hath given you a letter.

151
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.270
That's the letter I writ to her friend.

152
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:25.370
And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.

153
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.930
I would it were no worse.

154
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.030
I'll warrant you, 'tis as well:

155
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.870
For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,

156
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.800
Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;

157
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.670
Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,

158
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:41.930
Herself hath taught her love himself

159
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.230
to write unto her lover.

160
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.430
All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.

161
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.770
Why muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.

162
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.130
I have dined.

163
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.970
Ay, but hearken, sir;

164
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.570
though the chameleon Love can feed on the air,

165
00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.030
I am one that am nourished by my

166
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.330
victuals, and would fain have meat.

167
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.900
O, be not like your mistress; be moved, be moved.

168
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.970
Have patience, gentle Julia.

169
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.370
I must, where is no remedy.

170
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:17.930
When possibly I can, I will return.

171
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:22.070
If you turn not, you will return the sooner.

172
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:28.130
Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.

173
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.230
Why then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this.

174
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:36.100
And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.

175
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.230
Here is my hand for my true constancy;

176
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.700
And when that hour o'erslips me in the day

177
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.030
Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,

178
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.000
The next ensuing hour some foul mischance

179
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!

180
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.370
My father stays my coming; answer not;

181
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:57.230
The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears;

182
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.770
That tide will stay me longer than I should.

183
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.700
Julia, farewell!

184
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.770
What, gone without a word?

185
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.270
Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;

186
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.570
For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.

187
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.630
Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.

188
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.330
Go; I come, I come.

189
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:26.600
Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.

190
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.700
Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping;

191
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.230
all the kind of the Launces have this very fault.

192
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.500
I have received my proportion, like the prodigious son,

193
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.600
and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's court.

194
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.170
I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natured dog that lives:

195
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.570
my mother weeping, my father wailing,

196
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.400
my sister crying, our maid howling,

197
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.970
our cat wringing her hands,

198
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.430
yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear:

199
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.330
he is a stone, a very pebble stone,

200
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:09.000
and has no more pity in him than a dog:

201
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.870
a Jew would have wept to have seen our parting;

202
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.270
why, my grandam,

203
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.130
having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my parting.

204
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.900
Nay, I'll show you the manner of it.

205
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:23.730
This shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father:

206
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.500
no, no, this left shoe is my mother:

207
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.730
nay, that cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so,

208
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:33.500
it hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in it,

209
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.000
is my mother, and this my father; a vengeance on't!

210
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.570
there 'tis: now, sit, this staff is my sister,

211
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:42.870
for, look you, she is as white as a lily

212
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:48.830
and as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid:

213
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:52.530
I am the dog: no, the dog is himself,

214
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.630
and I am the dog--Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself;

215
00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:02.430
ay, so, so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing:

216
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:06.470
now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:

217
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:12.300
now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on.

218
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.170
Now come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now

219
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:21.430
weaping like a wild woman! Now should I kiss my mother;

220
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:28.100
why, there 'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down.

221
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:34.400
Now come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes.

222
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:40.230
Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a word;

223
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.670
but see how I lay the dust with my tears.

224
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:47.770
Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is shipped

225
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.470
and thou art to post after with oars.

226
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.600
What's the matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass!

227
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.530
You'll lose the tide, if you tarry any longer.

228
00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.170
It is no matter if the tied were lost;

229
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.900
for it is the unkindest tied that ever any man tied.

230
00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.170
What's the unkindest tide?

231
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.970
Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog.

232
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.030
Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood,

233
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.000
and, in losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and,

234
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.570
in losing thy voyage, lose thy master,

235
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.300
and, in losing thy master, lose thy service,

236
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.700
and, in losing thy service,--Why dost thou stop my mouth?

237
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.300
For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.

238
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.430
Where should I lose my tongue?

239
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:17.470
In thy tale.

240
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:18.500
In thy tail!

241
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.430
Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master,

242
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.400
and the service, and the tied! Why, man,

243
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.130
if the river were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears;

244
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.770
if the wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.

245
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:33.400
Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.

246
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.970
Sir, call me what thou darest.

247
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.370
Wilt thou go?

248
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:43.530
Well, I will go.

249
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.370
Servant!

250
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:28.170
Mistress?

251
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.330
Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.

252
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:31.530
Ay, boy, it's for love.

253
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:32.730
Not of you.

254
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:34.070
Of my mistress, then.

255
00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.530
'Twere good you knocked him.

256
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:36.930
Servant, you are sad.

257
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.770
Indeed, madam, I seem so.

258
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.400
Seem you that you are not?

259
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.330
Haply I do.

260
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.270
So do counterfeits.

261
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:42.970
So do you.

262
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.270
What seem I that I am not?

263
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:45.170
Wise.

264
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.700
What instance of the contrary?

265
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.730
Your folly.

266
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.000
And how quote you my folly?

267
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.370
I quote it in your jerkin.

268
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.000
My jerkin is a doublet.

269
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.900
Well, then, I'll double your folly.

270
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.030
How?

271
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.530
What, angry, Sir Thurio! do you change colour?

272
00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:02.430
Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.

273
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:03.430
That hath more mind

274
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.070
to feed on your blood than live in your air.

275
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.570
You have said, sir.

276
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.270
Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.

277
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.900
I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.

278
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.570
A fine volley of words, gentlemen,

279
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.170
and quickly shot off.

280
00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.430
'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.

281
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.630
Who is that, servant?

282
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.970
Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire.

283
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:31.070
Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks,

284
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.370
and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.

285
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.400
Sir, if you spend word for word with me,

286
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.200
I shall make your wit bankrupt.

287
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.930
I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words,

288
00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:42.630
and, I think, no other treasure to give your

289
00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.300
followers, for it appears by their bare liveries,

290
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.330
that they live by your bare words.

291
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:52.730
No more, gentlemen, no more:--here comes my father.

292
00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:02.700
Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.

293
00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.630
Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:

294
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.570
What say you to a letter from your friends

295
00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:08.870
Of much good news?

296
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.070
My lord, I will be thankful.

297
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.400
To any happy messenger from thence.

298
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.730
Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?

299
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.230
Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman

300
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.330
To be of worth and worthy estimation

301
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.070
And not without desert so well reputed.

302
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.200
Hath he not a son?

303
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.470
Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves

304
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.530
The honour and regard of such a father.

305
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.800
You know him well?

306
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.800
I know him as myself; for from our infancy

307
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.270
We have conversed and spent our hours together:

308
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:39.300
And though myself have been an idle truant,

309
00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.600
Omitting the sweet benefit of time

310
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.900
To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,

311
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.300
Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,

312
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.900
Made use and fair advantage of his days;

313
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.670
His years but young, but his experience old;

314
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.570
His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;

315
00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.570
And, in a word, for far behind his worth

316
00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.870
Comes all the praises that I now bestow,

317
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.000
He is complete in feature and in mind

318
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.370
With all good grace to grace a gentleman.

319
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.200
Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,

320
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.030
He is as worthy for an empress' love

321
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.300
As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.

322
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.470
Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,

323
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.230
With commendation from great potentates;

324
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.330
And here he means to spend his time awhile:

325
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.600
I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.

326
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.100
Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.

327
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.000
Welcome him then according to his worth.

328
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.630
Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;

329
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.770
For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:

330
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.670
I will send him hither to you presently.

331
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.770
This is the gentleman I told your ladyship

332
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.630
Had come along with me, but that his mistress

333
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:52.330
Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.

334
00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.970
Belike that now she hath enfranchised them

335
00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.500
Upon some other pawn for fealty.

336
00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.500
Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.

337
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.200
Nay, then he should be blind;

338
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.900
and, being blind How could he see his way to seek out you?

339
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:12.370
Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.

340
00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.870
They say that Love hath not an eye at all.

341
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.130
To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:

342
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.170
Upon a homely object Love can wink.

343
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:23.930
Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.

344
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:30.930
Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,

345
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.630
Confirm his welcome with some special favour.

346
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.870
His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,

347
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.970
If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.

348
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.030
Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him

349
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:44.230
To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.

350
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:47.400
Too low a mistress for so high a servant.

351
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.630
Not so, sweet lady: but too mean a servant

352
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.130
To have a look of such a worthy mistress.

353
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.130
Leave off discourse of disability:

354
00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.900
Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.

355
00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.430
My duty will I boast of; nothing else.

356
00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:02.430
And duty never yet did want his meed:

357
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.170
Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.

358
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.670
I'll die on him that says so but yourself.

359
00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.300
That you are welcome?

360
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.930
That you are worthless.

361
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.730
Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.

362
00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:20.030
I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,

363
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.970
Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:

364
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.170
I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;

365
00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:28.870
When you have done, we look to hear from you.

366
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.600
We'll both attend upon your ladyship.

367
00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:42.900
Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?

368
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.770
Your friends are well and have them much commended.

369
00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:45.700
And how do yours?

370
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:46.730
I left them all in health.

371
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.630
How does your lady? and how thrives your love?

372
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.400
My tales of love were wont to weary you;

373
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.930
I know you joy not in a love discourse.

374
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:57.300
Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:

375
00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.630
I have done penance for contemning Love,

376
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.900
Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me

377
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.800
With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,

378
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.370
With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;

379
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.230
For in revenge of my contempt of love,

380
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.100
Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes

381
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.370
And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.

382
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.900
O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,

383
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.570
And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,

384
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.230
There is no woe to his correction,

385
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.730
Nor to his service no such joy on earth.

386
00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.270
Now no discourse, except it be of love;

387
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.700
Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,

388
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.700
Upon the very naked name of love.

389
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.800
Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.

390
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.730
Was this the idol that you worship so?

391
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.430
Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?

392
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.100
No; but she is an earthly paragon.

393
00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.300
Call her divine.

394
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.370
I will not flatter her.

395
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:48.630
O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.

396
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.670
When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,

397
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.030
And I must minister the like to you.

398
00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.030
Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,

399
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.570
Yet let her be a principality,

400
00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.830
Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.

401
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:59.400
Except my mistress.

402
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.470
Sweet, except not any;

403
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.600
Except thou wilt except against my love.

404
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.630
Have I not reason to prefer mine own?

405
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.230
And I will help thee to prefer her too:

406
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:09.300
She shall be dignified with this high honour--

407
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.430
To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth

408
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:13.800
Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss

409
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.170
And, of so great a favour growing proud,

410
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.330
Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower

411
00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.400
And make rough winter everlastingly.

412
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.400
Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?

413
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.430
Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing

414
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:29.100
To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;

415
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:29.800
She is alone.

416
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.970
Then let her alone.

417
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.830
Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,

418
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.570
And I as rich in having such a jewel

419
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.430
As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,

420
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.530
The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.

421
00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.900
Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,

422
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.400
Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.

423
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.230
My foolish rival, that her father likes

424
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.330
Only for his possessions are so huge,

425
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.300
Is gone with her along, and I must after,

426
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.300
For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.

427
00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.570
But she loves you?

428
00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:03.800
Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our, marriage-hour,

429
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.930
With all the cunning manner of our flight,

430
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:08.400
Determined of; how I must climb her window,

431
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.870
The ladder made of cords, and all the means

432
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.200
Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.

433
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.830
Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,

434
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.270
In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.

435
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.030
Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:

436
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:20.430
I must unto the road, to disembark

437
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:22.270
Some necessaries that I needs must use,

438
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.370
And then I'll presently attend you.

439
00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:24.070
Will you make haste?

440
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.470
I will.

441
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:54.770
(wind blows furiously)

442
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:19.170
Even as one heat another heat expels,

443
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:23.330
Or as one nail by strength drives out another,

444
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.370
So the remembrance of my former love

445
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:31.130
Is by a newer object quite forgotten.

446
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:36.830
Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,

447
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:41.830
Her true perfection, or my false transgression,

448
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.270
That makes me reasonless to reason thus?

449
00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:49.930
She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--

450
00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:57.470
That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;

451
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.870
Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,

452
00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:03.370
Bears no impression of the thing it was.

453
00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.270
Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,

454
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:08.570
And that I love him not as I was wont.

455
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:12.270
O, but I love his lady too too much,

456
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.370
And that's the reason I love him so little.

457
00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.470
How shall I dote on her with more advice,

458
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:21.230
That thus without advice begin to love her!

459
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.930
'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,

460
00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:26.900
And that hath dazzled my reason's light;

461
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.770
But when I look on her perfections,

462
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:35.100
There is no reason but I shall be blind.

463
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:41.000
If I can cheque my erring love, I will;

464
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:48.030
If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.

465
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.030
Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to the courts!

466
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:56.170
Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not welcome.

467
00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.730
I reckon this always, that a man is never undone

468
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.000
till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a place

469
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.300
till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say 'Welcome!'

470
00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.970
Come on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with you presently;

471
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:08.000
where, for one shot of five pence,

472
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.400
thou shalt have five thousand welcomes.

473
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.170
But, sirrah, how did thy master part with Madam Julia?

474
00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:14.800
Marry, after they closed in earnest,

475
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.700
they parted very fairly in jest.

476
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.530
But shall she marry him?

477
00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:18.230
No.

478
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:19.170
How then? shall he marry her?

479
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.830
No, neither.

480
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:21.800
What, are they broken?

481
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.070
No, they are both as whole as a fish.

482
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:24.470
Why, then, how stands the matter with them?

483
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:26.030
Marry, thus: when it stands well with him,

484
00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:27.470
it stands well with her.

485
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.400
What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.

486
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.330
What a block art thou, that thou canst not!

487
00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:32.300
My staff understands me.

488
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.200
What thou sayest?

489
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.570
Ay, and what I do too:

490
00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:36.430
look thee, I'll but lean, and my staff understands me.

491
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:37.870
It stands under thee, indeed.

492
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.430
Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.

493
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:44.600
But tell me true, will't be a match?

494
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:51.070
Ask my dog: if he say yes, it will! if he say no, it will;

495
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:55.200
if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.

496
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.500
The conclusion is then that it will.

497
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.100
Thou shalt never get such a secret from me

498
00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.370
but by a parable.

499
00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:01.930
'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayest thou,

500
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:04.230
that my master is become a notable lover?

501
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.470
I never knew him otherwise.

502
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:07.500
Than how?

503
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.030
A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.

504
00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.200
Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.

505
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.500
Why, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.

506
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.900
I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.

507
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.530
Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself in love.

508
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:20.730
If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse;

509
00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:23.670
if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew,

510
00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:25.070
and not worth the name of a Christian.

511
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:26.030
Why?

512
00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.770
Because thou hast not so much charity in thee

513
00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.270
as to go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?

514
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.930
At thy service.

515
00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:47.700
To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;

516
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.730
To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;

517
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:55.200
To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;

518
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.070
And even that power which gave me first my oath

519
00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:01.300
Provokes me to this threefold perjury;

520
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:08.370
Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.

521
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:12.730
O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,

522
00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:17.630
Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!

523
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.930
At first I did adore a twinkling star,

524
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:28.730
But now I worship a celestial sun.

525
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:32.300
Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,

526
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.800
And he wants wit that wants resolved will

527
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:39.130
To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.

528
00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:46.330
Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,

529
00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:47.930
Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd

530
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:51.630
With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.

531
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:58.930
I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;

532
00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:02.500
But there I leave to love where I should love.

533
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:07.730
Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:

534
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:13.970
If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;

535
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:18.700
If I lose them, thus find I by their loss

536
00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:23.030
For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.

537
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.730
I to myself am dearer than a friend,

538
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:29.500
For love is still most precious in itself;

539
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:33.830
And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--

540
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:42.470
Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.

541
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:46.100
I will forget that Julia is alive,

542
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.870
Remembering that my love to her is dead;

543
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.170
And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,

544
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.930
Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.

545
00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:57.330
I cannot now prove constant to myself,

546
00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:04.600
Without some treachery used to Valentine.

547
00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:10.170
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder

548
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.000
To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,

549
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.570
Myself in counsel, his competitor.

550
00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.430
Now presently I'll give her father notice

551
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:21.030
Of their disguising and pretended flight;

552
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:24.600
Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;

553
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.900
For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;

554
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.730
But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross

555
00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:39.570
By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.

556
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:48.730
Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,

557
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:53.600
As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!

558
00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:01.370
Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;

559
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.130
And even in kind love I do conjure thee,

560
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:06.800
Who art the table wherein all my thoughts

561
00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.900
Are visibly character'd and engraved,

562
00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.100
To lesson me and tell me some good mean

563
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:14.830
How, with my honour, I may undertake

564
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.830
A journey to my loving Proteus.

565
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.570
Alas, the way is wearisome and long!

566
00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:21.470
A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary

567
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:24.330
To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;

568
00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:28.300
Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,

569
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.070
And when the flight is made to one so dear,

570
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.830
Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.

571
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:34.930
Better forbear till Proteus make return.

572
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:38.770
O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?

573
00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.200
Pity the dearth that I have pined in,

574
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.900
By longing for that food so long a time.

575
00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.030
Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,

576
00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.770
Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow

577
00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:51.500
As seek to quench the fire of love with words.

578
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.730
I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,

579
00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.430
But qualify the fire's extreme rage,

580
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:59.870
Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.

581
00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:02.830
The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.

582
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:05.070
The current that with gentle murmur glides,

583
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:08.830
Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;

584
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:12.630
But when his fair course is not hindered,

585
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.400
He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,

586
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.330
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge

587
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.730
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,

588
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:21.900
And so by many winding nooks he strays

589
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.630
With willing sport to the wild ocean.

590
00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:29.100
Then let me go and hinder not my course

591
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.400
I'll be as patient as a gentle stream

592
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.170
And make a pastime of each weary step,

593
00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:39.800
Till the last step have brought me to my love;

594
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.730
And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil

595
00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:46.000
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.

596
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.200
But in what habit will you go along?

597
00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.400
Not like a woman; for I would prevent

598
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.270
The loose encounters of lascivious men:

599
00:32:57.270 --> 00:33:00.930
Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds

600
00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:04.500
As may beseem some well-reputed page.

601
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.700
Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.

602
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.430
No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings

603
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:13.230
With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.

604
00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:14.500
To be fantastic may become a youth

605
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.430
Of greater time than I shall show to be.

606
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.630
What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?

607
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.330
That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,

608
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.130
What compass will you wear your farthingale?'

609
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.230
Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.

610
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:26.030
You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.

611
00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.200
Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd.

612
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.900
A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,

613
00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.900
Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.

614
00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.530
Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have

615
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:38.700
What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.

616
00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.930
But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me

617
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:44.570
For undertaking so unstaid a journey?

618
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:46.370
I fear me, it will make me scandalized.

619
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:48.800
If you think so, then stay at home and go not.

620
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.200
Nay, that I will not.

621
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.700
Then never dream on infamy, but go.

622
00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.330
If Proteus like your journey when you come,

623
00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:58.270
No matter who's displeased when you are gone:

624
00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:00.930
I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.

625
00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:04.470
That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:

626
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:08.070
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears

627
00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:09.900
And instances of infinite of love

628
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.930
Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.

629
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:14.930
All these are servants to deceitful men.

630
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:17.770
Base men, that use them to so base effect!

631
00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.330
But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth

632
00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:26.200
His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,

633
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.400
His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,

634
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.130
His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,

635
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:34.430
His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.

636
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:37.330
Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!

637
00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:39.700
Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong

638
00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.070
To bear a hard opinion of his truth:

639
00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:46.500
Only deserve my love by loving him;

640
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:50.230
And presently go with me to my chamber,

641
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.500
To take a note of what I stand in need of,

642
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:55.300
To furnish me upon my longing journey.

643
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:03.230
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,

644
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.530
My goods, my lands, my reputation;

645
00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:07.170
Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.

646
00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:10.070
Come, answer not, but to it presently!

647
00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:12.170
I am impatient of my tarriance.

648
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:32.230
