00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200


2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.430
Heigh-ho!

3
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.800
An it be not four by the day, I'll be hanged.

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.830
Charles' wain is over the new chimney

5
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.800
and yet our horse not packed.

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.470
What, ostler!

7
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.900
I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle.

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.500
Put a few flocks in the point.

9
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.500
The poor jade is wrung in the withers out of all cess.

10
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.600
Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog.

11
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.900
That's the next way to give poor jades the bots.

12
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.570
This house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.

13
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.230
Poor fellow, he's never joyed since the price of oats rose.

14
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.530
It was the death of him.

15
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.570
I think this be the most villainous house

16
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.370
in all London road for fleas.

17
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.570
I'm stung like a tench.

18
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.600
What, ostler!

19
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.630
Come away and be hanged!

20
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.370
Come away!

21
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.330
I've a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,

22
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.770
to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.

23
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.070
God's body!

24
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.030
The turkeys in my pannier are quite starved.

25
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.870
Come, neighbour Mugs.

26
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.730
We'll call up the gentlemen.

27
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.770
They will along with company, for they have great charge.

28
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.730
What ho, chamberlain.

29
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.030
At hand, quoth pick-purse.

30
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.370
Good morrow, Master Peto.

31
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.730
It holds current that I told you yesternight.

32
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.130
There's a franklin in the wild of Kent

33
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.430
hath brought three hundred marks with him in gold.

34
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.230
I heard him tell it to one of his party

35
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.430
last night at supper, a kind of auditor,

36
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.700
one that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.

37
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.200
Here.

38
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.330
They're up already and call for eggs and butter.

39
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.830
They will away presently.

40
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.230
Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas' clerks,

41
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.870
I'll give thee this neck.

42
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.400
Nay, I'll none of it.

43
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.130
I pray thee keep that for the hangman,

44
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.530
for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas

45
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.100
as truly as a man of falsehood may.

46
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.130
What talkest thou to me of the hangman?

47
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.370
If I hang, I'll make a fat pair of gallows,

48
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.400
for if I hang, old Sir John hangs with me,

49
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.230
and thou knowest he's no starveling.

50
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.770
Tut!

51
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.270
There are other Trojans that thou dreamest not of,

52
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.700
the which for sport sake

53
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.670
are content to do the profession some grace,

54
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.000
that would, if matters should be looked into,

55
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.800
for their own credit sake, make all whole.

56
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.200
I'm joined with no foot-land rakers,

57
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.230
no long-staff sixpenny strikers,

58
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.230
none of your mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms

59
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.130
but with nobility and tranquility,

60
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.400
burgomasters and great oneyers.

61
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.930
Give me your hand.

62
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.700
Thou shalt have a share in our purchase,

63
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.130
as I am a true man.

64
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.130
Nay, rather let me have it, as thou art a false thief.

65
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.700
Come!

66
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.030
Shelter, shelter.

67
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.470
I have removed Falstaff's horse,

68
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.530
and he frets like a gummed velvet.

69
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.170
Stand close.

70
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.800
Poins, and be hanged!

71
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.930
Poins!

72
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.570
Peace, ye fat-kidneyed rascal.

73
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.970
What a brawling dost thou keep.

74
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:21.970
Where's Poins, Hal?

75
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.600
He is walked up to the top of the hill.

76
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.900
I'll go seek him.

77
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.500
I'm accursed to rob.in that thief's company.

78
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.970
The rascal hath removed my horse and tied him I know not where.

79
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.870
If I travel but four foot further afoot,

80
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.530
I shall break my wind.

81
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.730
Poins, Hal!

82
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.130
A plague on you both!

83
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.370
Bardolph, Peto!

84
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.030
I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further.

85
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.330
Eight yards of uneven ground

86
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.700
is threescore and ten miles afoot with me,

87
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.170
and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough.

88
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.130
A plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another.

89
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.800
A plague on you all.

90
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.100
Give me my horse, you rogues.

91
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.100
Give me my horse, and be hanged!

92
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.530
Peace, ye fat-guts!

93
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.430
Lie down.

94
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.930
Lay thine ear close to the ground,

95
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.230
and list if thou canst hear the tread of travelers.

96
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.900
Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down?

97
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.430
'Sblood, I'll not bear my own flesh so far afoot again

98
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.370
for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.

99
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.470
What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?

100
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.600
Thou liest.

101
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.370
Thou art not colted; thou art uncolted.

102
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.470
I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse,

103
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.470
good king's son.

104
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.470
Out, ye rogue.

105
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.770
Shall I be your ostler?

106
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.300
Hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent garters.

107
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.300
If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this.

108
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.070
An I have not ballads made on you all

109
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.300
and sung to filthy tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison.

110
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.300
Stand!

111
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.430
So I do, against my will.

112
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.600
O, 'tis our setter.

113
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.000
I know his voice.

114
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.670
Bardolph, what news?

115
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.070
Case ye. Case ye.

116
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.600
On with your vizards.

117
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.730
There's money of the king's coming down the hill.

118
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.370
'Tis going to the king's exchequer.

119
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.900
You lie, ye rogue.

120
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.870
'Tis going to the king's tavern.

121
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.870
There's enough to make us all.

122
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.170
To be hanged.

123
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.230
Sirs, you three shall front them in the narrow lane.

124
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.070
Ned Poins and I will walk lower.

125
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.730
If they 'scape from your encounter,

126
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.900
then they light on us.

127
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.070
How many be there of them?

128
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.200
Some eight or ten.

129
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.000
'Zounds, will they not rob us?

130
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.730
What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?

131
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.870
Indeed, I'm not John of Gaunt, your grandfather,

132
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.130
but yet no coward, Hal.

133
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.430
I'll leave that to the proof.

134
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.630
Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge.

135
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.830
When thou needest him, there thou shalt find him.

136
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.270
Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged.

137
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.230
Ned, where are our disguises?

138
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.070
Here, hard by.

139
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.070
Stand close.

140
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.030
Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I.

141
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.600
Every man to his business.

142
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:54.930
Strike!

143
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:55.930
Down with them!

144
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.370
Cut the villains' throats!

145
00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.370
Ay, whoreson caterpillars!

146
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.200
Bacon-fed knaves!

147
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.200
They hate us youth!

148
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.200
Down with them!

149
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:10.330
Now, my masters, let us to horse before day.

150
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.930
An the Prince and Poins be not two arrant cowards,

151
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.230
there's no equity stirring.

152
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.570
There's no more valor in that Poins

153
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.100
than in a wild duck.

154
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.470
Got with much ease.

155
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.230
Falstaff sweats to death.

156
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.900
He lards the lean earth as he walks along.

157
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.770
Were 't not for laughing, I would pity him.

158
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.200
Ooh, how the fat rogue roar'd.

159
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.200
"But for mine own part, my lord,

160
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.930
"I could be well contented to be there,

161
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.770
in respect of the love I bear your house."

162
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.300
He could be contented?

163
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.630
Why is he not, then?

164
00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.830
In respect of the love he bears our house,

165
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.030
he shows in this he loves his own barn better

166
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.100
than he loves our house.

167
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.200
Let me see some more.

168
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.300
"The purpose you undertake is dangerous."

169
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.600
Why, that's certain.

170
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.500
'Tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink.

171
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.700
But I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle, danger,

172
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.700
we pluck this flower, safety.

173
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.730
"The purpose you undertake is dangerous,

174
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.630
"the friends you have named uncertain,

175
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.500
"the time itself unsorted, and your whole plot too light

176
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.230
for the counterpoise of so great an opposition."

177
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.900
Say you so? Say you so?

178
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.370
I say unto you again,

179
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.500
you're a shallow, cowardly hind, and you lie.

180
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.800
What a lack-brain is this!

181
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.900
By the Lord, our plot is a good plot as ever was laid,

182
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.170
our friends true and constant.

183
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.570
A good plot, good friends, and full of expectation.

184
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.600
An excellent plot, very good friends.

185
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.670
What a frosty-spirited rogue is this.

186
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.330
Why, my lord of York commends the plot

187
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.270
and the general course of the action.

188
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.100
'Zounds, an I were now by this rascal,

189
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.500
I could brain him with his lady's fan.

190
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.570
Is there not my father, my uncle, and myself?

191
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.370
Lord Edmund Mortimer, my lord of York,

192
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:09.370
and Owen Glendower?

193
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.870
Is there not besides the Douglas?

194
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.830
Have I not all their letters to meet me in arms

195
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.200
by the ninth of the next month?

196
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.330
And are they not some of them set forward already?

197
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.900
What a pagan rascal is this!

198
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.700
An infidel!

199
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.700
Ha!

200
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.570
You shall see now,

201
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.000
out of very sincerity of fear and cold heart

202
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.030
will he to the king

203
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.400
and lay open all our proceedings.

204
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.270
Oh, I could divide myself and go to buffets

205
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.430
for moving such a dish of skim milk

206
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.830
with so honorable an action!

207
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.830
Hang him!

208
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.600
Let him tell the king.

209
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.770
We are prepared.

210
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.270
I will set forward tonight.

211
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.430
How now, Kate.

212
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.030
I must leave you within these two hours.

213
00:08:55.030 --> 00:09:00.700
My good lord, why are you thus alone?

214
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.870
For what offense have I this fortnight been

215
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.730
a banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?

216
00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.930
Tell me, sweet lord,

217
00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:13.000
what is't that takes from thee thy stomach, pleasure,

218
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.100
and thy golden sleep?

219
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.730
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth

220
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.070
and start so often when thou sit'st alone?

221
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.700
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks

222
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.730
and given my treasures and my rights of thee

223
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:31.230
to thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?

224
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:37.070
In thy faint slumbers, I by thee have watch'd

225
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.600
and heard thee murmur tales of iron wars,

226
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.200
speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed,

227
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.400
cry "Courage!

228
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.930
To the field!"

229
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.030
And thou hast talk'd of sallies and retires,

230
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.030
of trenches, tents,

231
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.130
of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,

232
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.870
of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,

233
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:03.670
of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain

234
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.370
and all the currents of a heady fight.

235
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.470
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war

236
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.570
and thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep

237
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.570
that beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow

238
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:20.100
like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream.

239
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:25.400
And in thy face, strange motions have appear'd

240
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.100
such as we see when men restrain their breath

241
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.800
on some great sudden hest.

242
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.500
Oh, what portents are these?

243
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.630
Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,

244
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:41.700
and I must know it, else he loves me not.

245
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.530
What, ho!

246
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.770
Is Gilliams with the packet gone?

247
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.430
He is, my lord, an hour ago.

248
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.670
Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?

249
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.430
One horse, my lord, he brought even now.

250
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:53.500
What horse?

251
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.230
A roan, a crop-ear, is it not?

252
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.530
It is, my lord.

253
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.430
That roan shall be my throne.

254
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.500
Well, I will back him straight.

255
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.630
O esperance!

256
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.200
But hear you, my lord.

257
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.870
What say'st thou, my lady?

258
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.970
What is it carries you away?

259
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.270
Why, my horse, my love, my horse.

260
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.900
Out, you mad-headed ape!

261
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.570
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen

262
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.930
as you are toss'd with.

263
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.670
In faith, I'll know thy business, Harry,

264
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.030
that I will.

265
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:29.100
I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir about his title

266
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.500
and hath sent for you to line his enterprise.

267
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.730
But if you go--

268
00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:36.700
So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.

269
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.430
Oh, come, come, you paraquito.

270
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.800
Answer me directly unto this question that I ask.

271
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.570
In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,

272
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.670
an if thou wilt not tell me all things true.

273
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:48.870
Ah!

274
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.630
Away.

275
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.000
Away, you trifler!

276
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.470
Love!

277
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:57.430
I love thee not.

278
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:58.700
I care not for thee, Kate.

279
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.400
This is no world to play with mammets

280
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.700
and to tilt with lips.

281
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.670
We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns

282
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.870
and pass them current too.

283
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.330
God's me, my horse!

284
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.300
What say'st thou, Kate?

285
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.670
What would'st thou have of me?

286
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.000
Do you not love me?

287
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.730
Do you not, indeed?

288
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.200
Well, do not then, for since you love me not,

289
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.170
I will not love myself.

290
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.630
Do you not love me?

291
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:26.470
Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.

292
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.530
Come.

293
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:32.400
Will you see me ride?

294
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:36.770
And when I am on horseback,

295
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.100
I will swear I love thee infinitely.

296
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.570
But hark you, Kate.

297
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.700
I must not have you henceforth question me

298
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.370
whither I go, nor reason whereabout.

299
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.900
Whither I must, I must, and, to conclude,

300
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.770
this evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.

301
00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.030
I know you're wise

302
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:53.930
but yet no farther wise than Harry Percy's wife.

303
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:57.170
Constant you are but yet a woman.

304
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.900
And for secrecy, no lady closer, for I well believe

305
00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:04.200
thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know.

306
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.570
And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.

307
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.670
How, so far?

308
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.130
Not an inch further.

309
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.200
But hark you, Kate.

310
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.070
Whither I go, thither shall you go too.

311
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.770
Today will I set forth, tomorrow you.

312
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.800
Will this content you, Kate?

313
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:31.170
It must, of force.

314
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.400
Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room,

315
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.530
and lend me thy hand to laugh a little.

316
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.670
Where hast been, Hal?

317
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.300
With three or four loggerheads

318
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.700
amongst three or four score hogsheads.

319
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.400
I have sounded the very base-string of humility.

320
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.900
Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers

321
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.930
and can call them all by their christen names,

322
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.700
as Tom, Dick, and Francis.

323
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.370
They take it already upon their salvation

324
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.400
that though I be prince of Wales yet,

325
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.200
I am king of courtesy and tell me flatly

326
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.930
I'm no proud Jack, like Falstaff,

327
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:34.600
but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy,

328
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.470
by the Lord, so they call me.

329
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.400
And when I'm king of England,

330
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.270
I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap.

331
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.000
Old Sir John and and a few dozen more

332
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.170
are at the door.

333
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.670
Shall I let them in?

334
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.930
Let them alone awhile.

335
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.300
I am now of all humors

336
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.930
that have showed themselves humors

337
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.770
since the old days of goodman Adam

338
00:14:55.770 --> 00:15:00.200
to the pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.

339
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:05.400
I am not yet of Percy's mind, the Hotspur of the north,

340
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.570
he that kills me

341
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.970
some six or seven dozen Scots at a breakfast,

342
00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:11.700
washes his hands, and says to his wife.

343
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.300
"Fie upon this quiet life!

344
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.500
I want work."

345
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.970
"Oh, my sweet Harry," says she,

346
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.270
"how many hast thou killed today?"

347
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.930
"Give my roan horse a drench," says he

348
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:27.270
and answers "some fourteen" an hour after.

349
00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.200
"A trifle, a trifle."

350
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.700
I prithee, call in Falstaff.

351
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.070
I'll play Percy,

352
00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.000
and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his wife.

353
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.630
Falstaff!

354
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.330
"Rivo," says the drunkard!

355
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.570
Call in ribs! Call in tallow!

356
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:46.400
Welcome, Jack.

357
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.970
Where hast thou been?

358
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.670
A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too.

359
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:54.870
Marry, and amen.

360
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.670
Give me a cup of sack, boy.

361
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:58.530
Ere I lead this life long,

362
00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:02.730
I'll sew nether stocks and mend them and foot them too.

363
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.400
A plague of all cowards.

364
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.670
Give me a cup of sack, rogue!

365
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.370
Is there no virtue extant?

366
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:11.200
Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?

367
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.900
Pitiful-hearted Titan,

368
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.430
that melted at the sweet tale of the sun's.

369
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.200
If thou didst, then behold that compound.

370
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.270
You rogue!

371
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.900
There's lime in this sack too.

372
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.400
There's nothing but roguery to be found in villainous man.

373
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.870
But a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it.

374
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.770
A villainous coward.

375
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:34.200
"Go thy ways, old Jack.

376
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.670
Die when thou wilt."

377
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.130
If manhood, good manhood,

378
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.030
be not forgot upon the face of the earth,

379
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.830
then am I a shotten herring.

380
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:45.800
There lives not three good men unhanged in England,

381
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.570
and one of them is fat and grows old.

382
00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:49.570
God help the while.

383
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:51.530
A bad world, I say.

384
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.170
I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or anything.

385
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.130
A plague of all cowards, I say still.

386
00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.470
How now, wool-sack.

387
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:58.470
What mutter you?

388
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:59.800
A king's son!

389
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.170
Oh, if I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom

390
00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:05.070
with a dagger of lath and drive all thy subjects

391
00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:06.770
afore thee like a flock of wild geese,

392
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.400
I'll never wear hair on my face more.

393
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.770
You Prince of Wales!

394
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:12.270
Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?

395
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.430
Are not you a coward?

396
00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.430
Answer me that.

397
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:15.930
And Poins there?

398
00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.700
'Zounds, ye fat paunch.

399
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.170
Ye call me a coward.

400
00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.430
By the Lord, I'll stab thee.

401
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.170
I, call thee coward?

402
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.100
I'll see thee damned ere I call thee coward.

403
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.500
But I'd give a thousand pounds

404
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.530
I could run as fast as thou canst.

405
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.430
You're straight enough in the shoulders,

406
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.300
you care not who sees your back.

407
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.300
Call you that backing of your friends?

408
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.230
A plague upon such backing!

409
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:38.600
Give me them that will face me.

410
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.370
Give me a cup of sack!

411
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:41.670
I'm a rogue, if I drunk today.

412
00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.130
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

413
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.470
Oh, villain.

414
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.770
Thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunkest last.

415
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:47.770
All's one for that.

416
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.630
A plague of all cowards, I say still.

417
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:52.070
What's the matter?

418
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.300
What's the matter?

419
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.470
There be three of us here

420
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.500
have ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.

421
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.270
Where is it, Jack? Where is it?

422
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.700
Where is it?

423
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:07.400
Ta'en from us it is, a hundred upon poor three of us.

424
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.500
What, a hundred?

425
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.530
I am a villain

426
00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:10.700
if I was not at half-sword

427
00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.000
with a dozen of them two hours together.

428
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.800
I have 'scaped by miracle.

429
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.770
I am eight times thrust through the doublet,

430
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:17.830
four through the hose,

431
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.730
my buckler cut through and through,

432
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:21.430
my sword hacked like a hand-saw.

433
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.300
Ecce signum.

434
00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.500
I never dealt better since I was a man.

435
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.300
All would not do.

436
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.400
A plague of all cowards.

437
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.600
Let them speak.

438
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.270
If they speak more or less than truth,

439
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.200
they are villains and the sons of darkness.

440
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.070
Speak, sirs. How was it?

441
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.970
We three set up some dozen--

442
00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.100
Sixteen at least, my lord, and bound them.

443
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.370
No, no, they were not bound.

444
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.000
They were bound, every one of them,

445
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.870
or I'm a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.

446
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.030
As we were sharing,

447
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.000
some six or seven fresh men set upon us--

448
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.230
And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.

449
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.270
What, fought you with them all?

450
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.300
All?

451
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:56.230
I know not what you call "all."

452
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.000
But if I fought not with fifty of them,

453
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.070
then am I a bunch of radish.

454
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.670
If there were not two or three and fifty on poor old Jack,

455
00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:04.170
then am I no two-legged creature.

456
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.100
Pray God you have not murdered some of them.

457
00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.130
Oh, no, that's past praying for.

458
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.630
I have peppered two of them.

459
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.070
Two, I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits.

460
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.430
I tell thee what, Hal.

461
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.300
If I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse.

462
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.570
Thou knowest my old ward.

463
00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.170
Here I lay.

464
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.970
Thus I bore my point.

465
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.200
Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--

466
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.070
What, four? Thou saidst but two even now.

467
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.300
Four, Hal.

468
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.900
I told thee four.

469
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.800
Ay, ay, he said four.

470
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.130
These four came all a-front and mainly thrust at me.

471
00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:37.400
I made me no more ado

472
00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.300
but took all their seven points in my target, thus.

473
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.000
Seven? Why, there were but four even now.

474
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
In buckram?

475
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.170
Ay, four in buckram suits.

476
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.370
Seven, by these hilts,

477
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:47.630
or I'm a villain else.

478
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.170
Prithee, let him alone. We shall have more anon.

479
00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.200
Dost thou hear, Hal?

480
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.700
Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.

481
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.070
Do so, for it is worth the listening to.

482
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.600
These nine in buckram that I told thee of--

483
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.630
So two more already.

484
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:59.900
Their points being broken--

485
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:00.970
Down fell their hose.

486
00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.170
Began to give me ground.

487
00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.570
But I followed me close, came in foot and hand.

488
00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.800
And with a thought, seven of the eleven I paid.

489
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.830
O monstrous!

490
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.630
Eleven buckram men grown out of two!

491
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.430
But, as ill luck would have it,

492
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:13.600
three misbegotten knaves in Kendal green

493
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.800
came at my back and let drive at me,

494
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.500
for it was so dark, Hal,

495
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.430
thou couldst not see thy hand.

496
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.870
These lies are like their father that begets them:

497
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.600
gross as a mountain, open, palpable.

498
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.930
Why, thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool,

499
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.400
thou whoreson, obscene, greasy tallow-catch.

500
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.800
What, art thou mad? Art thou mad?

501
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.130
Is not the truth the truth?

502
00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:38.430
Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green

503
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:42.600
when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand?

504
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.370
Come, tell us your reason.

505
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:46.900
What sayest thou to this?

506
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.770
Come, your reason, Jack.

507
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:49.770
Your reason.

508
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.030
What, upon compulsion?

509
00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.800
'Zounds, an I were at the strappado

510
00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.170
or all the racks in the world

511
00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.770
I would not tell you on compulsion.

512
00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.830
Give you a reason on compulsion?

513
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.170
If reasons were as plentiful as blackberries,

514
00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.730
I would give no man a reason upon compulsion, I.

515
00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.700
I'll be no longer guilty of this sin.

516
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.130
This sanguine coward, this bed-presser,

517
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:16.030
this horseback-breaker, this huge hill of flesh--

518
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.670
'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin,

519
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.330
you dried neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle,

520
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.830
you stock-fish!

521
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.430
O for breath to utter what is like thee!

522
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.070
You tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase,

523
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:30.230
you vile standing-tuck--

524
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:37.000
Breathe awhile, and then do it again.

525
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.700
And when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,

526
00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.970
hear me speak but this.

527
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.670
Mark, Jack.

528
00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:49.100
We two saw you three set on four

529
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.330
and were masters of their wealth.

530
00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.600
Mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down.

531
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.530
Then did we two set on you three

532
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:02.000
and, with a word, out-faced you from your prize

533
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.370
and have it.

534
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.700
Yea, and can show it you here in the house.

535
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:11.970
And, Falstaff, you carried your guts away as nimbly

536
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.400
with as quick dexterity,

537
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.130
and roared for mercy and still run and roared

538
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:20.700
as ever I heard bull-calf.

539
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.330
What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword

540
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:30.300
as thou hast done and then say it was in fight.

541
00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:36.230
What trick, what device, what starting-hole

542
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.330
canst thou now find out to hide thee

543
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.170
from this open and apparent shame?

544
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.800
Come, Jack.

545
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.500
What trick hast thou now?

546
00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:55.030
By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.

547
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:59.530
Why, hear you, my masters.

548
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.430
Was it for me to kill the heir-apparent?

549
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.400
Should I turn upon the true prince?

550
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.830
Why, thou knowest I'm as valiant as Hercules.

551
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.370
But beware instinct.

552
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:15.370
The lion will not touch the true prince.

553
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:18.070
Instinct is a great matter.

554
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.970
I was now a coward upon instinct.

555
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:24.870
I shall think the better of myself and thee during my life:

556
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.500
I for a valiant lion, thou for a true prince.

557
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.430
But, by the Lord, lads, I'm glad you have the money.

558
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:35.330
Hostess, clap to the doors!

559
00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.970
Watch today. Pray to-morrow.

560
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:39.700
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold,

561
00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.870
all the titles of good fellowship come to you.

562
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.070
What, shall we be merry?

563
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:45.030
Shall we have a play extempore?

564
00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:48.300
Content, and the argument shall be thy running away.

565
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.100
No more of that, an thou lovest me!

566
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.170
My lord the prince!

567
00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:54.630
How now, my lady the hostess.

568
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:55.930
What sayest thou to me?

569
00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.130
Marry, my lord, a nobleman of the court is at door,

570
00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:59.170
would speak with you.

571
00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:00.730
He says he comes from your father.

572
00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.670
Give him as much as will make him a royal man,

573
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.300
and send him back again to my mother.

574
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.970
-What manner of man is he? -An old man.

575
00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:07.930
What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight?

576
00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.200
Shall I give him,his answer?

577
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.300
Prithee, do, Jack.

578
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.870
'Faith, and I'll send him packing.

579
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:15.700
Now, sirs, by our lady, you fought fair, Peto.

580
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.470
So did you, Bardolph.

581
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:18.900
You are lions too.

582
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.900
You ran away upon instinct, would not touch the true prince.

583
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.970
No, fie!

584
00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.900
I ran when I saw others run.

585
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.430
'Faith, tell me now in earnest,

586
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.500
how came Falstaff's sword so hacked?

587
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.000
Why, he hacked it with his dagger

588
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.870
and said he would swear truth out of England

589
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.000
but he would make you believe it was done in fight

590
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.570
and persuaded us to do the like.

591
00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:39.830
Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass

592
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.370
to make them bleed

593
00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.330
and then to beslubber our garments with it

594
00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.800
and swear it was the blood of true men.

595
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:50.530
I did what I did not this seven year before.

596
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:55.270
I blushed to hear his monstrous devices.

597
00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.930
Villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago

598
00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:59.300
and wert taken with the manner,

599
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.400
and ever since, thou hast blushed extempore.

600
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.170
Here comes lean Jack. Here comes bare-bone.

601
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.430
How now, my sweet creature of bombast!

602
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:10.100
How long is't ago, Jack,

603
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.430
since thou saw thine own knee?

604
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:14.930
My own knee?

605
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.930
When I was about thy years, Hal,

606
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.830
I was not an eagle's talon in the waist.

607
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:23.970
I could have crept into any alderman's thumb-ring.

608
00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.370
A plague of sighing and grief;

609
00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:28.570
it blows a man up like a bladder.

610
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.300
Now, shush, shush, shush.

611
00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.770
There's villainous news abroad.

612
00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.600
Here was Sir John Bracy from your father.

613
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.230
You must to the court in the morning.

614
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.870
That same mad fellow of the north, Percy,

615
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:41.200
and he of Wales that gave Amamon the bastinado

616
00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.600
and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the devil

617
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.800
his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh hook--

618
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.930
what a plague call you him?

619
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.000
Oh, Glendower.

620
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.870
Owen, Owen, the same.

621
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.200
And his son-in-law Mortimer and old Northumberland

622
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.230
and that sprightly Scot of Scots, Douglas,

623
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.100
he that runs o' horseback up a hill perpendicular--

624
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.570
He that rides at high speed

625
00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.500
and with his pistol kills,a sparrow flying.

626
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.500
You've hit it.

627
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.030
So did he never the sparrow.

628
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.900
Well, there's good mettle in that fellow.

629
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.230
He will not run.

630
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:09.700
Why, what a rascal art thou then

631
00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.300
to praise him so for running.

632
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.430
O' horseback, ye cuckoo.

633
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.300
But afoot, he will not budge a foot.

634
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.070
Yes, Jack, upon instinct.

635
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.200
Well, I grant ye, upon instinct.

636
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.330
Well, he is there too and one Mordake

637
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.100
and a thousand blue-caps more.

638
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.170
Worcester is stolen away tonight.

639
00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:27.870
Your father's beard is turned white at the news.

640
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:31.470
You may buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.

641
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:35.530
Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June,

642
00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:37.870
we shall buy maidenheads as they buy hob-nails:

643
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.270
by the hundreds.

644
00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.170
Oh, by the mass, thou sayest true, lad.

645
00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:43.200
It is like we shall have good trading that way.

646
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.830
But tell me, Hal, art not thou horrible afeard?

647
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.370
Thou being heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out

648
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.630
three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas,

649
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:55.400
that spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower?

650
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.000
Art thou not horribly afraid?

651
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.270
Doth not thy blood thrill at it?

652
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.670
Not a whit, i' faith.

653
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.770
I lack some of thy instinct.

654
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:07.770
Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow

655
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:09.370
when thou comest to thy father.

656
00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:11.970
An thou love me, practice an answer.

657
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.030
Do thou stand for my father

658
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:19.000
and examine me upon the particulars of my life.

659
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.400
Oh, uh, shall I?

660
00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.170
Yes!

661
00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:24.300
Content.

662
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.900
Come on, come on, come on.

663
00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.130
This chair shall be my state, this dagger my scepter,

664
00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:33.400
and this cushion my crown.

665
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:38.230
Give me a cup of sack to make my eyes look red,

666
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:39.730
that it may be thought I have wept.

667
00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:42.500
Stand aside, nobility.

668
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.100
O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!

669
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:50.230
Weep not, sweet queen...

670
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:54.430
for trickling tears are vain.

671
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:56.970
O, the father, see how he holds his countenance!

672
00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:01.400
For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen.

673
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.630
For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.

674
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:06.600
O Jesu, he doth it as like one

675
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.300
of these harlotry players as ever I see.

676
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.770
Peace, good pint-pot.

677
00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:15.100
Peace, good tickle-brain.

678
00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.830
Harry.

679
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.100
Ah, yea.

680
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.970
I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time

681
00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:24.700
but also how thou art accompanied.

682
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.230
There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of,

683
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.530
and it is known to many in this land by the name of pitch.

684
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:35.370
This pitch, as ancient writers do report,

685
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.230
doth defile.

686
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:40.500
So doth the company thou keepest.

687
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:44.470
Harry, I do not speak to thee in drink but in tears,

688
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.230
not in pleasure but in passion,

689
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:52.030
not in words only but in woes also.

690
00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:56.400
And yet there is a virtuous man

691
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.300
whom I have often noted in thy company,

692
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.900
but I know not his name.

693
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.300
What manner of man, an it like your majesty?

694
00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.870
A goodly, portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent,

695
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.800
of a cheerful look, a pleasing eye,

696
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.530
and a most noble carriage.

697
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:19.570
And, as I think, his age some fifty,

698
00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:25.470
or, by'r lady, inclining to three score.

699
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:31.270
And now I remember me; his name is...

700
00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.070
Falstaff.

701
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.900
If that man should be lewdly given,

702
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.100
he deceiveth me,

703
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.070
for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks.

704
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.330
If then the tree shall be known by the fruit,

705
00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.970
as the fruit by the tree, then, peremptorily I speak it,

706
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.870
there is virtue in that Falstaff.

707
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:54.830
Him, keep with. The rest, banish.

708
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:58.930
And now tell me, thou naughty varlet,

709
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.200
tell me, where hast thou been this month?

710
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.230
Dost thou speak like a king?

711
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:05.870
Do thou stand for me, and I'll play my father.

712
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:06.900
What?

713
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.530
Depose me?

714
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.070
Yea!

715
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:14.300
If thou dost it half so gravely, so majestically,

716
00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.330
both in word and matter, hang me up by the heels

717
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:18.670
for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.

718
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:19.800
Here I am set.

719
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.070
And here I stand. Now judge, my masters.

720
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.430
Now, Harry, whence come you?

721
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:26.030
My noble lord, from Eastcheap.

722
00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:29.100
The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.

723
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.500
'Sblood, my lord, they're false.

724
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.730
Nay, I'll tickle ye for a young prince, i' faith.

725
00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.830
Swearest thou, ungracious boy?

726
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:39.430
Henceforth, ne'er look on me.

727
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.900
Thou art violently carried away from grace.

728
00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.200
There is a devil haunts thee

729
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:49.570
in the likeness of an old, fat man.

730
00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:52.770
A tun of man is thy companion.

731
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.470
Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humors,

732
00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:58.200
that bolting-hutch of beastliness,

733
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:04.070
that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack,

734
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:07.070
that stuffed cloak-bag of guts,

735
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:10.500
that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly,

736
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.700
that reverend vice, that gray iniquity,

737
00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.230
that father ruffian, that vanity in years?

738
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:20.730
Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink it?

739
00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:25.030
Wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a capon and eat it?

740
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.130
Wherein cunning, but in craft?

741
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.470
Wherein crafty, but in villainy?

742
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:34.200
Wherein villainous, but in all things?

743
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:40.470
Wherein worthy, but in nothing?

744
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.930
I would your grace would take me with you.

745
00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:48.370
Whom means your grace?

746
00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:52.030
That villainous abominable misleader of youth, Falstaff,

747
00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:54.370
that old, white-bearded Satan.

748
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:59.530
Well, my lord, the man, I know.

749
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:01.430
I know thou dost.

750
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:05.100
But to say that I know more harm in him than in myself

751
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.330
were to say more than I know.

752
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:10.800
That he is old, the more the pity,

753
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.100
his white hairs do witness it.

754
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.830
But that he is, saving your reverence,

755
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.930
a whoremaster, that, I utterly deny.

756
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:20.230
If sack and sugar be a fault, God help the wicked.

757
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:23.200
If to be old and merry be a sin,

758
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.430
then many an old host that I know is damned.

759
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:28.470
If to be fat be to be hated,

760
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:32.530
then Pharaoh's lean kine are to be loved.

761
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.300
No, my good lord.

762
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.770
Banish Peto.

763
00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:36.800
Banish Bardolph.

764
00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.070
Banish Poins.

765
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:43.630
But for sweet Jack Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff,

766
00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:47.670
true Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack Falstaff,

767
00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:50.500
and therefore more valiant, being, as he is,

768
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.730
old Jack Falstaff,

769
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:56.070
banish not him thy Harry's company.

770
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:59.030
Banish not him thy Harry's company.

771
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:03.170
Banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.

772
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.070
I do.

773
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:11.070
I will.

774
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:15.000
My lord! My lord!

775
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.370
The sheriff, with a most monstrous watch,

776
00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:18.370
is at the door.

777
00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:19.370
Out, ye rogue!

778
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:20.630
Play out the play.

779
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:23.170
I have much to say in the behalf of that Falstaff.

780
00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:25.430
O Jesu, my lord, my lord.

781
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:27.270
Heigh, the devil rides on a fiddlestick.

782
00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.470
What's the matter?

783
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:30.830
The sheriff and all the watch are at the door.

784
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:33.500
They are come to search the house.

785
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.400
Shall I let them in?

786
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:42.300
Dost thou hear, Hal?

787
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:46.030
Never call a true piece of gold a counterfeit.

788
00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.870
Thou art essentially mad, without seeming so.

789
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:53.530
And thou a natural coward without instinct.

790
00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.500
I deny your major.

791
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.730
If you will deny the sheriff, so.

792
00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.970
If not, let him enter.

793
00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:03.000
If I become not a cart as well as another man,

794
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.430
a plague upon my bringing up.

795
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:10.170
I hope I shall be as soon strangled with a halter as another.

796
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.370
Go hide thee behind the arras.

797
00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:20.500
The rest walk up above.

798
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:25.370
Now, my masters, for a good face and a true conscience.

799
00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:28.200
Both which I have had, but their date is out,

800
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.430
and therefore I'll hide me.

801
00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:38.030
Call in the sheriff.

802
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.500
Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?

803
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.000
First, pardon me, my lord.

804
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.170
A hue and cry hath follow'd several men unto this house.

805
00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:55.400
What men?

806
00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.330
One of them is well known, my gracious lord,

807
00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:59.130
a gross, fat man.

808
00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:00.870
As fat as butter.

809
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:03.130
The man, I do assure you, is not here,

810
00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:05.130
for I myself at this time have employ'd him.

811
00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.730
And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee

812
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:09.670
that I will, by dinnertime tomorrow,

813
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.300
send him to answer thee, or any man,

814
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.400
for any thing he shall be charged withal.

815
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.030
And so let me entreat you leave the house.

816
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.700
I will, my lord.

817
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:20.230
There are two gentlemen

818
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:22.430
have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.

819
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.400
It may be so.

820
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.930
If he have robb'd these men, he shall be answerable.

821
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:28.870
And so farewell.

822
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:31.430
Good night, my noble lord.

823
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:33.570
I think it is good morrow, is it not?

824
00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:37.530
Indeed, my lord, methinks it be two o'clock.

825
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:46.430
This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's.

826
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:48.070
Go, call him forth.

827
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.370
Falstaff!

828
00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:00.200
Behind the arras, and snorting like a horse.

829
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:07.100
Hark, how hard he fetches breath.

830
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:10.030
Search his pockets.

831
00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:21.800
What hast thou found?

832
00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.630
Nothing but papers, my lord.

833
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.870
Let's see what they be. Read them.

834
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:29.000
"Item, a capon, 2s2d.

835
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.930
"Item, sauce, 4d.

836
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:34.700
"Item, sack, two gallons, 5s8d.

837
00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:39.800
"Item, anchovies and sack after supper, 2s6d.

838
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.570
Item, bread, ha'penny."

839
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:44.130
Oh, monstrous.

840
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:45.830
But one ha'penny-worth of bread

841
00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:49.470
to this intolerable deal of sack.

842
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:50.830
What there is else, keep close.

843
00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:52.330
We'll read it at more advantage.

844
00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:56.230
There let him sleep till day.

845
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:59.230
I'll to the court in the morning.

846
00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:01.400
We must all to the wars,

847
00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:05.770
and thy place shall be honorable.

848
00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:08.330
I'll procure this fat rogue a charge of foot.

849
00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:11.530
And I know his death will be a march of twelve-score.

850
00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.170
The money shall be paid back again with advantage.

851
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:17.830
Be with me betimes in the morning.

852
00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:21.200
And so good morrow, Ned.

853
00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.900
Good morrow, good my lord.

854
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.500
