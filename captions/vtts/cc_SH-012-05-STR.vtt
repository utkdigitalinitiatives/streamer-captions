00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000


2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Now does my project gather to a head:

3
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.300
My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time

4
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.800
Goes upright with his carriage.

5
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.900
How's the day?

6
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.830
On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,

7
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.300
You said our work should cease.

8
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.500
I did say so,

9
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.000
When first I raised the tempest.

10
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.100
Say, spirit,

11
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.930
How fares the king and's followers?

12
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.130
Confined together

13
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.070
In the same fashion as you gave in charge,

14
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.030
Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,

15
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.370
In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;

16
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.130
They cannot budge till your release.

17
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.330
The king,

18
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.730
His brother and yours, abide all three distracted,

19
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.700
The remainder mourning over them,

20
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.300
Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly

21
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.970
Him you term'd, sir, "The good old lord Gonzalo;"

22
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.330
His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops

23
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.200
From eaves of reeds.

24
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.900
Your charm so strongly works 'em

25
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.200
That if you now beheld them, your affections

26
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.000
Would become tender.

27
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.500
Dost thou think so, spirit?

28
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.730
Mine would, sir, were I human.

29
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.300
And mine shall.

30
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.330
Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling

31
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.300
Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,

32
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.870
One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,

33
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.230
Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?

34
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.830
Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,

35
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.370
Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury

36
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.970
Do I take part: the rarer action is

37
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.470
In virtue than in vengeance:

38
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.370
they being penitent,

39
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.330
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend

40
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.800
Not a frown further.

41
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.070
Go release them, Ariel:

42
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.130
My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,

43
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.470
And they shall be themselves.

44
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.270
I'll fetch them, sir.

45
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.830
Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,

46
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.400
And ye that on the sands with printless foot

47
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.200
Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him

48
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.370
When he comes back; you demi-puppets that

49
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.570
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,

50
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.830
Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime

51
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.570
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice

52
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.300
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,

53
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.730
Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd

54
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.330
The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,

55
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.870
And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault

56
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.630
Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder

57
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.470
Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak

58
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.200
With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory

59
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.200
Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up

60
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.200
The pine and cedar: graves at my command

61
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.700
Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth

62
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.370
By my so potent art.

63
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.970
But this rough magic

64
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.570
I here abjure,

65
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.970
and, when I have required

66
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.330
Some heavenly music, which even now I do,

67
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.170
To work mine end upon their senses that

68
00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.930
This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,

69
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.200
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,

70
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.470
And deeper than did ever plummet sound

71
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.270
I'll drown my book.

72
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.200
A solemn air and the best comforter

73
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.570
To an unsettled fancy cure thy brain,

74
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.400
Now useless, boil'd within thy skull.

75
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.270
There stand,

76
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.770
For you are spell-stopp'd.

77
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.370
Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,

78
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.970
Mine eyes, even sociable to a show of thine,

79
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.730
Fall fellowly drops.

80
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.130
The charm dissolves apace,

81
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.070
And as the morning steals upon the night,

82
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.330
Melting the darkness, so their rising senses

83
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.630
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle

84
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.270
Their clearer reason.

85
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.700
O good Gonzalo,

86
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.630
My true preserver, and a loyal sir

87
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.870
To him thou follow'st.

88
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.300
I will pay thy graces

89
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.470
Home both in word and deed.

90
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.630
Most cruelly

91
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.630
Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:

92
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.570
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.

93
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.800
Thou art pinch'd for't now, Sebastian.

94
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.400
Flesh and blood,

95
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.100
You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,

96
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.600
Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,

97
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.930
Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,

98
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.200
Would here have kill'd your king;

99
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:49.600
I do forgive thee, Unnatural though thou art.

100
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.530
Their understanding

101
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.930
Begins to swell, and the approaching tide

102
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.800
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore

103
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.830
That now lies foul and muddy.

104
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.170
Not one of them

105
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.900
That yet looks on me, or would know me: Ariel.

106
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.730
I will discase me, and myself present

107
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.870
As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;

108
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.570
Thou shalt ere long be free.

109
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.500
Where the bee sucks, there suck I:

110
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.000
In a cowslip's bell I lie;

111
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.800
There I couch when owls do cry.

112
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.570
On the bat's back I do fly

113
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.130
After summer merrily.

114
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.600
Merrily, merrily shall I live now

115
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:40.400
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.

116
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.570
Why, that's my dainty Ariel.

117
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.930
I shall miss thee:

118
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.570
But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.

119
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.630
To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:

120
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.600
There thou shalt find the mariners asleep

121
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.830
Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain

122
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.830
Being awake, enforce them to this place,

123
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.070
And presently, I prithee.

124
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.800
I drink the air before me, and return

125
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.430
Or ere your pulse twice beat.

126
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.170
All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement

127
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.100
Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us

128
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.430
Out of this fearful country.

129
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.970
Behold, sir king,

130
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:25.030
The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:

131
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.170
For more assurance that a living prince

132
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.230
Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;

133
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.970
And to thee and thy company I bid

134
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.170
A hearty welcome.

135
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.930
Whether thou be'st he or no,

136
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.700
Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,

137
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.500
As late I have been, I not know:

138
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:52.270
Thy pulse beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,

139
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.000
The affliction of my mind amends,

140
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.400
with which, I fear, a madness held me:

141
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.130
this must crave,

142
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.370
An if this be at all, a most strange story.

143
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:06.300
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat

144
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.770
Thou pardon me my wrongs.

145
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.100
But how should Prospero

146
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.130
Be living and be here?

147
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.130
First, noble friend,

148
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:20.200
Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot

149
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.100
Be measured or confined.

150
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.200
Whether this be

151
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.470
Or be not, I'll not swear.

152
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:26.800
You do yet taste

153
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.330
Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you

154
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.130
Believe things certain.

155
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.270
Welcome, my friends all.

156
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:42.270
But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,

157
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.570
I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you

158
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:48.630
And justify you traitors: at this time

159
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.300
I will tell no tales.

160
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.830
The devil speaks in him.

161
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.300
No.

162
00:08:54.300 --> 00:09:00.630
For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother

163
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.530
Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive

164
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:09.300
Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require

165
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.400
My dukedom of thee, which I know perforce

166
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.730
Thou must restore.

167
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.100
If thou be'st Prospero,

168
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.000
Give us particulars of thy preservation;

169
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.800
How thou hast met us here, who three hours since

170
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.300
Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--

171
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.600
How sharp the point of this remembrance is--

172
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.970
My dear son Ferdinand.

173
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.200
I am woe for't, sir.

174
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.330
Irreparable is the loss, and patience

175
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.330
Says it is past her cure.

176
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.770
I rather think

177
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.500
You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace

178
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.630
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid

179
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.370
And rest myself content.

180
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.330
You the like loss?

181
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.870
As great to me as late; for I

182
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.430
Have lost my daughter.

183
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.130
A daughter?

184
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.930
O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,

185
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.630
The king and queen there; that they were, I wish

186
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.630
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed

187
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.270
Where my son lies.

188
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.800
When did you lose your daughter?

189
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.170
In this last tempest.

190
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.470
I perceive these lords

191
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.130
At this encounter do so much admire

192
00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.530
That they devour their reason and scarce think

193
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.570
Their eyes do offices of truth, their words

194
00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.830
Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have

195
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:39.270
Been justled from your senses, know for certain

196
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.300
That I am Prospero and that very duke

197
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.630
Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely

198
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.200
Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,

199
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.470
To be the lord on't.

200
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.670
But no more yet of this;

201
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.270
For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,

202
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.830
Not a relation for a breakfast or

203
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:55.330
Befitting this first meeting.

204
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.030
Welcome, sir.

205
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.830
This cell's my court: here have I few attendants

206
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:10.470
And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.

207
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.400
My dukedom since you have given me again,

208
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.730
I will requite you with as good a thing;

209
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.970
At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye

210
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.570
As much as me my dukedom.

211
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.570
Sweet lord, you play me false.

212
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.930
No, my dear'st love, I would not for the world.

213
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.570
Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,

214
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.530
And I would call it fair play.

215
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.230
If this prove

216
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.230
A vision of the Island, one dear son

217
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.130
Shall I twice lose.

218
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.630
A most high miracle.

219
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.570
Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;

220
00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:58.070
I have cursed them without cause.

221
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.200
Now all the blessings

222
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.800
Of a glad father compass thee about.

223
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.530
Arise, and say how thou camest hither.

224
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.770
O, wonder!

225
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.730
How many goodly creatures are there here.

226
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.230
How beauteous mankind is.

227
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.800
O brave new world,

228
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.370
That has such people in't.

229
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.530
'Tis new to thee.

230
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.630
What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?

231
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.930
Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:

232
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.100
Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,

233
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.630
And brought us thus together?

234
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.770
Sir, she is mortal;

235
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.000
But by immortal Providence she's mine:

236
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.270
I chose her when I could not ask my father

237
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.270
For his advice, nor thought I had one.

238
00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.630
She is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,

239
00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.600
Of whom so often I have heard renown,

240
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.000
But never saw before; of whom I have

241
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.630
Received a second life; and second father

242
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.570
This lady makes him to me.

243
00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.500
I am hers:

244
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.630
But, O, how oddly will it sound that I

245
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.870
Must ask my child forgiveness.

246
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.430
There, sir, stop:

247
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.700
Let us not burden our remembrance with

248
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.470
A heaviness that's gone.

249
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.500
I have inly wept,

250
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.470
Or should have spoke ere this.

251
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.700
Look down, you gods,

252
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.030
And on this couple drop a blessed crown.

253
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.200
For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way

254
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.430
Which brought us hither.

255
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.870
I say, Amen, Gonzalo.

256
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.030
Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue

257
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.630
Should become kings of Naples?

258
00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:34.100
O, rejoice

259
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.200
Beyond a common joy, and set it down

260
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.370
With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage

261
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:45.070
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,

262
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.030
And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife

263
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:52.470
Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom

264
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:57.530
In a poor isle, and all of us ourselves

265
00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:02.270
When no man was his own.

266
00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.970
Give me your hands:

267
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.870
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart

268
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.000
That does not wish you joy.

269
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.200
Be it so.

270
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.470
Amen.

271
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.330
O, look, sir, look, sir; here is more of us:

272
00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.470
I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,

273
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.970
This fellow could not drown.

274
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.030
Now, blasphemy,

275
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:32.170
That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?

276
00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.370
Hast thou no mouth by land?

277
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:35.930
What is the news?

278
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.530
The best news is, that we have safely found

279
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:44.600
Our king and company; the next, our ship--

280
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.000
Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--

281
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.070
Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when

282
00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:50.200
We first put out to sea.

283
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.900
Sir, all this service

284
00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.170
Have I done since I went.

285
00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:54.270
My tricksy spirit.

286
00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.470
These are not natural events; they strengthen

287
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.130
From strange to stranger.

288
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.270
Say, how came you hither?

289
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.030
If I did think, sir, I were well awake,

290
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.400
I'd strive to tell you.

291
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.330
We were dead of sleep,

292
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.230
And--how I know not-- all clapp'd under hatches;

293
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.330
Where but even now with strange and several noises

294
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:15.030
Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,

295
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.100
And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,

296
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.000
We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;

297
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.030
Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld

298
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.130
Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master

299
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.070
Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,

300
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.600
Even in a dream, were we divided from them

301
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.530
And were brought moping hither.

302
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:34.100
Was't well done?

303
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.600
Bravely, my diligence.

304
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.430
Thou shalt be free.

305
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.400
This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod

306
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.700
And there is in this business more than nature

307
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.570
Was ever conduct of: some oracle

308
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.130
Must rectify our knowledge.

309
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.370
Sir, my liege,

310
00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.200
Do not infest your mind with beating on

311
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.800
The strangeness of this business;

312
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.970
at pick'd leisure

313
00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.270
Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,

314
00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.230
Which to you shall seem probable, of every

315
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.830
These happen'd accidents; till then, be cheerful

316
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.400
And think of each thing well.

317
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.000
Come hither, spirit:

318
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Set Caliban and his companions free;

319
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.200
Untie the spell.

320
00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.800
How fares my gracious sir?

321
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.370
There are yet missing of your company

322
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.070
Some few odd lads that you remember not.

323
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.530
Every man shift for all the rest,

324
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.700
and let no man take care for himself;

325
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.770
for all is but fortune.

326
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.800
Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!

327
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.630
If these be true spies which I wear in my head,

328
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.570
here's a goodly sight.

329
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:42.630
O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!

330
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.030
How fine my master is.

331
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.300
I am afraid

332
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.070
He will chastise me.

333
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.970
What things are these, my lord Antonio?

334
00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:52.070
Will money buy 'em?

335
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.230
Very like; one of them

336
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.270
Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.

337
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.970
Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,

338
00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.870
Then say if they be true.

339
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.130
This mis-shapen knave,

340
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.970
His mother was a witch, and one so strong

341
00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.330
That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,

342
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.930
And deal in her command without her power.

343
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:17.500
These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--

344
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.000
For he's a bastard one-- hath plotted with them

345
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.300
To take my life.

346
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.200
Two of these fellows you

347
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.030
Must know and own; this thing of darkness,

348
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.170
I acknowledge mine.

349
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.400
I shall be pinch'd to death.

350
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.230
Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?

351
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.570
He is drunk now: where had he wine?

352
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:42.530
And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they

353
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.530
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?

354
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.100
How camest thou in this pickle?

355
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.700
I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that,

356
00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.470
I fear me, will never out of my bones:

357
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:56.800
I shall not fear fly-blowing.

358
00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.300
Why, how now, Stephano.

359
00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:03.700
O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.

360
00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.230
You'd be king o' the isle, sirrah?

361
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.370
I should have been a sore one then.

362
00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:13.000
This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.

363
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.930
He is as disproportion'd in his manners

364
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.330
As in his shape.

365
00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.470
Go, sirrah, to my cell;

366
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:23.930
Take with you your companion; and as you look

367
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:29.100
To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.

368
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:36.330
Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter

369
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.270
And seek for grace.

370
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:42.900
What a thrice-double ass

371
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.630
Was I, to take this drunkard for a god

372
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.070
And worship this dull fool!

373
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:52.600
Go to; away.

374
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:58.770
Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.

375
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.000
Or stole it, rather.

376
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.070
Sir, I invite your highness and your train

377
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.930
To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest

378
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.530
For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste

379
00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.800
With such discourse as, I not doubt, will make it

380
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.500
Go quick away; the story of my life

381
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.570
And the particular accidents gone by

382
00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:27.630
Since I came to this isle: and in the morn

383
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:31.600
I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,

384
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.970
Where I have hope to see the nuptial

385
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:39.130
Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;

386
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:42.800
And thence retire me to my Milan, where

387
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.500
Every third thought shall be my grave.

388
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.830
I long

389
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.230
To hear the story of your life, which must

390
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.000
Take the ear strangely.

391
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.070
I'll deliver all;

392
00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:01.370
And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales

393
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.930
And sail so expeditious that shall catch

394
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:08.370
Your royal fleet far off.

395
00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:36.300
My Ariel, chick,

396
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:41.630
That is thy charge: then to the elements

397
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:46.430
Be free, and fare thou well.

398
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.570
Please you, draw near.

399
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.130
Now my charms are all o'erthrown,

400
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.700
And what strength I have's mine own,

401
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.170
Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,

402
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:24.630
I must be here confined by you,

403
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.630
Or sent to Naples.

404
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:29.930
Let me not, Since I have my dukedom got

405
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.500
And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell

406
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:38.070
In this bare island by your spell;

407
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.070
But release me from my bands

408
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:43.170
With the help of your good hands:

409
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.100
Gentle breath of yours my sails

410
00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.970
Must fill, or else my project fails,

411
00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:52.370
Which was to please.

412
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.370
Now I want

413
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:59.630
Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,

414
00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:06.030
And my ending is despair, Unless I be relieved by prayer,

415
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.070
Which pierces so that it assaults

416
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:13.900
Mercy itself and frees all faults.

417
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:20.200
As you from crimes would pardon'd be,

418
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:25.730
Let your indulgence set me free.

419
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.600
