WEBVTT

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.700
THE YANGTZE RIVER HOLDS
THE KEY TO CHINA'S FUTURE.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.330
FLOWING OVER 6,000
KILOMETERS FROM ITS SOURCE

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.860
ON THE TIBETAN PLATEAU
TO ITS SHANGHAI DELTA,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.500
IT'S THE MOST USED
WATERWAY IN THE WORLD.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.730
AND ONE OF THE
MOST DEADLY.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.360
IN THE LAST CENTURY ALONE
ITS FLOODS HAVE KILLED

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.700
OVER 300,000 PEOPLE.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.600
NOW MAN HAS STRUCK BACK
WITH AN ENGINEERING PROJECT

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.530
DESIGNED TO CORRAL THE
RIVER'S DESTRUCTIVE FORCES

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.900
AND BRING IT FIRMLY
UNDER HUMAN CONTROL.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.660
THE THREE GORGES DAM IS SO
LARGE IT'S VISIBLE FROM SPACE.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.030
DESIGNED TO PRODUCE
ENOUGH ELECTRICITY TO POWER

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.100
A TENTH OF CHINA'S TOTAL
NEEDS, THE DAM FEEDS THE

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.000
FRENZIED EXPANSION OF INLAND
MEGA CITIES SUCH AS CHONGQING,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.460
THE FASTEST GROWING URBAN
CENTER ON THE PLANET.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.230
BUT THIS PROGRESS HAS
COME AT A HUGE COST.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.930
UPSTREAM OF THE DAM
THE THREE GORGES REGION

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.700
HAS BEEN
DRASTICALLY ALTERED

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.700
AND SOME TWO MILLION PEOPLE
FORCED TO FLEE THEIR HOMES.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.260
DOWNSTREAM AT THE MOUTH OF
THE RIVER THE IMPACT OF THE DAM

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.160
IS ERODING THE COASTLINE
AT AN ALARMING RATE

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.630
THREATENING THE VERY
FOUNDATIONS UPON WHICH

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.530
SHANGHAI'S BOOMING
ECONOMY IS BUILT.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.430
THIS MASSIVE PUSH FOR GROWTH IS
RISKING ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.530
CHINA'S GREATEST RIVER FACES
A CRITICAL NEW CHALLENGE.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.760
CHINA IS WITNESSING
AN ECONOMIC GROWTH

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.760
THE PACE OF WHICH THE
WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.260
OLD AND YOUNG,
RICH AND POOR,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.800
ITS PEOPLE HAVE ENDURED
MUCH IN THE NAME OF PROGRESS.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.000
MANY HAVE BENEFITED FROM
THE COUNTRY'S NEW WEALTH.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.200
OTHERS HAVE
BEEN LEFT BEHIND

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.100
LESS WILLING OR LESS ABLE
TO BUY INTO THE DREAM.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.500
BUT RELENTLESSLY
THE DREAM GOES ON,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.560
DRIVEN BY THE COMMUNIST
PARTY'S GUIDING IDEA:

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.530
PERSONAL SACRIFICE
FOR THE GREATER GOOD.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.800
IT'S NOT ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO
ARE MADE TO CONFORM TO THIS

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.600
VISION OF THE FUTURE;
SO, TOO, IS THE LANDSCAPE.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.900
THE STORY OF THE YANGTZE RIVER
IS THE STORY OF MODERN CHINA.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.330
IT'S THE STARKEST EXAMPLE
OF THE GOVERNMENT'S QUEST

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.830
TO CONTROL NATURE IN
ITS PURSUIT OF PROGRESS.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.360
BUT THE YANGTZE IS NOT A
RIVER TO BE TOYED WITH.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.760
IT HAS THE POWER TO MAKE
AND TO BREAK THIS COUNTRY.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.800
IT ALWAYS HAS.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.300
FOR GENERATIONS THE YANGTZE
HAS FERTILIZED THE CROP

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.160
WHICH FEEDS THE WORLD'S
LARGEST POPULATION.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.860
CHINA'S RICE FIELDS
FLOURISH ON THE NUTRIENTS

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.930
WHICH THE
RIVER PROVIDES.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.630
FOR ON ITS COURSE
FROM MOUNTAIN TO SEA,

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.460
THE YANGTZE FEEDS OFF THE
SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.100
COLLECTING VAST AMOUNTS
OF MINERAL-RICH SEDIMENT

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.900
IN ITS WATERS.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.900
WHEN IT REACHES THE
FLATLANDS, THE YANGTZE FLOODS,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.660
DISTRIBUTING ITS FERTILE
SILT ACROSS THE LAND.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.330
TODAY THE FLOOD PLAINS OF
THE YANGTZE RIVER BASIN

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:56.960
PRODUCE NEARLY HALF OF ALL
CHINA'S GRAIN AND COTTON.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.200
BUT WHILE THE RIVER
GIVES, IT ALSO TAKES AWAY.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.430
THE ANNUAL FLOODING OF THE
YANGTZE HAS OFTEN POSED

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.760
A DEADLY THREAT TO
THOSE WHO LIVE NEAR IT.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.100
MOST RECENTLY, IN 1998, A
FLOOD CREST 53 METERS HIGH

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.160
SURGED DOWN RIVER,
SUBMERGING AN AREA

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:27.660
THE SIZE OF NEW ZEALAND AND
DESTROYING FIVE MILLION HOMES.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.560
HU KEN-CHUN IS A FARMER
WHO'S HOUSE LAY DIRECTLY

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.400
IN THE PATH OF
THE YANGTZE'S FURY.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.460
TRANSLATOR: IN 1998 OUR VILLAGE
WAS THE FIRST TO BE FLOODED.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.330
FROM THE BEGINNING AT THE
VILLAGE, ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.000
THE WATER FLOWED
THROUGH THE VILLAGE

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.060
AND COVERED
ALL THIS LAND.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.260
WE HAD TO TRAVEL BY BOAT AND ALL
THE BUILDINGS WERE SUBMERGED.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.100
>>AS THE WATERS FORCED
14 MILLION PEOPLE TO FLEE

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.260
FOR THEIR LIVES, THE GOVERNMENT
DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.160
TRANSLATOR: THE SOLDIERS AND
POLICE CAME TO OUR RESCUE.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.200
THEY RESCUED
OUR FAMILIES.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.530
THEY USED HELICOPTERS,
BOATS AND LIFEBUOYS

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.230
TO GET MOST
PEOPLE OUT.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.930
>>THE TOTAL COST OF THE 1998
FLOOD TOPPED 30 BILLION DOLLARS,

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.400
BOLSTERING THE BELIEF THAT
SOMETHING DRASTIC HAD TO BE DONE

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.760
TO PROTECT THE
PEOPLE FROM FLOODS.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.330
THIS IS HOW THE GOVERNMENT
PROPOSES TO SOLVE

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.460
THE PROBLEM OF THE
YANGTZE FLOODING -

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.200
WITH THE BARRIER OF
THE THREE GORGES DAM.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.530
STANDING 185 METERS TALL AND
OVER TWO KILOMETERS WIDE,

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.030
THIS GARGANTUAN
STRUCTURE IS CHINA'S

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.430
LARGEST BUILDING PROJECT
SINCE THE GREAT WALL.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.960
NOW IN ITS FINAL
STAGES OF CONSTRUCTION,

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.230
THE DAM WILL CREATE A FIVE
TRILLION GALLON RESERVOIR

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.630
HUNDREDS OF METERS DEEP
AND 650 KILOMETERS LONG,

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.530
HOLDING BACK
THE WATERS

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:15.260
THAT HAVE CAUSED SUCH
DEVASTATION IN THE PAST.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.860
THE IDEA FOR THE DAM
GOES BACK A LONG WAY.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:25.630
IN THE 1950'S THE COMMUNIST
LEADER MAO ZEDONG

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.400
WAS A WHOLE-HEARTED
SUPPORTER OF BUILDING

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.330
THE LARGEST HYDRO-ELECTRIC
DAM IN THE WORLD.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.030
HE TALKED OF SURPRISING
THE GODDESS OF WU GORGE

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:40.030
BY CREATING A HUGE MAN-MADE
LAKE BETWEEN THE DEEP CANYONS.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.430
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL 1994, AFTER
MAO'S DEATH, THAT THE PROJECT

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.630
GOT OFFICIAL APPROVAL AND THE
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.800
ORDERED THE DAMMING
OF THE YANGTZE TO BEGIN.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.130
IT WAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST
AMBITIOUS AND CONTROVERSIAL

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.860
ENGINEERING
PROJECTS IN HISTORY.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.900
TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WORKED
TIRELESSLY AROUND THE CLOCK

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.560
IN A RACE TO MEET ITS
ENGINEERING DEADLINE.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.560
SO FAR, THE COSTS HAVE
TOPPED 25 BILLION DOLLARS.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.230
BUT MANY WORKERS
PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:22.560
OVER A THOUSAND HAVE DIED
IN THE BUILDING OF THE DAM.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.960
ZHANG ZHAO GEN HAS BEEN
INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT SINCE

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.400
THE BEGINNING AND IS CHIEF
ENGINEER AT THE SITE TODAY.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.200
GOVERNMENT EXPERTS LIKE
ZHAO GEN CLAIM THAT THE DAM

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.800
ALLOWS THEM TO
CONTROL THE RIVER'S FLOW,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.560
REDUCING DOWNSTREAM
FLOODING AND POTENTIALLY

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.230
SAVING HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF LIVES.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.760
TRANSLATOR: BY BUILDING THIS DAM
WE HAVE REDUCED THE LIKELIHOOD

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.230
OF FLOODING FROM ONCE EVERY TEN
YEARS TO ONCE EVERY 100 YEARS.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.700
IF THE 1998
FLOODING REOCCURS,

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.030
THIS DAM WOULD
MAKE A HUGE IMPACT.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:01.530
THE RESIDENTS BELOW
WILL NOT BE AFFECTED.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:06.260
>>FEW DISPUTE THAT THE DAM
WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.900
THE FLOW OF THE RIVER, BUT
IT MIGHT AT THE SAME TIME

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.660
BE CREATING A
THREAT OF FLOODING

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.860
WORSE THAN ANYTHING
THAT'S GONE BEFORE...

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.830
BECAUSE THE THREE GORGES
REGION IS AN EARTHQUAKE ZONE

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.300
AND THIS CONCRETE
MEGASTRUCTURE

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.230
IS BUILT ON A
SEISMIC FAULT LINE.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.960
THE DANGER OF TRAPPING SUCH A
VAST RESERVOIR IN A SEISMICALLY

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.030
ACTIVE REGION HAS BEEN A
CAUSE OF MAJOR CONCERN.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.400
AND THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT
CLAIMS THE RISKS ARE SMALL,

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.200
THE DAM WAS BUILT WITH
THESE DANGERS IN MIND.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.230
TRANSLATOR: IN THIS AREA
EARTHQUAKES ARE RARE.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.660
AN EARTHQUAKE OF MORE
THAN SIX ON THE RICHTER SCALE

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.260
WOULD ONLY HAPPEN ONCE
EVERY TEN THOUSAND YEARS.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.630
BUT THIS DAM IS DESIGNED
TO COPE WITH AN EARTHQUAKE

00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:00.530
AS STRONG AS
LEVEL SEVEN.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:04.200
>>BUT IF THE SCIENCE IS
WRONG AND AN EARTHQUAKE

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.200
MAKES THE DAM FAIL, THE
EFFECT ON THE 75 MILLION PEOPLE

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.260
LIVING DOWNSTREAM
WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.330
WHAT'S MORE, SOME
EXPERTS CLAIM THAT THE DAM

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.260
MIGHT ACTUALLY
CAUSE AN EARTHQUAKE.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.100
THE SHEER WEIGHT OF THE
RESERVOIR COULD STRESS

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.930
THE EARTH'S CRUST
TO DANGER LEVELS.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.360
SUCH EVENTS HAVE BEEN
RECORDED EVEN IN AREAS

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.700
WITH NO PREVIOUS
HISTORY OF TREMORS.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.460
BUT THE SCIENTISTS ARE
CALCULATING THAT THE RISK OF

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:37.760
EARTHQUAKE IS SMALL COMPARED
TO THE BENEFIT THE DAM OFFERS.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.600
AND SO FAR THE
SCIENTISTS SEEM TO BE RIGHT.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.660
SINCE THE DAM WAS BUILT THE
RAINS HAVE COME AND GONE.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.900
AND THOUGH THERE'S BEEN SOME
LOCALIZED FLOODING DOWNSTREAM,

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.660
THE WATERS HAVE
BEEN CONTAINED.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:58.730
LOSS OF LIFE HAS
BEEN AT A MINIMUM.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:04.030
BUT SAVING LIVES IS JUST ONE OF
THE REASONS THIS DAM WAS BUILT.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.700
JUST AS IMPORTANT
IS THAT IT'S CRUCIAL

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.030
TO CHINA'S
INDUSTRIAL AMBITIONS.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.930
THE THREE GORGES DAM IS
DESIGNED TO TAME THE YANGTZE,

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.560
TRANSFORMING IT FROM WILD RIVER
TO ONE OF THE MOST NAVIGABLE

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.060
AND PROFITABLE
WATERWAYS IN THE WORLD.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.860
BEFORE THE DAM WAS BUILT, THE
YANGTZE'S CURRENT WAS SO STRONG

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.630
THAT LARGE RIVER TRAFFIC HAD
TROUBLE GETTING UPSTREAM.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.730
THE DAM HAS CHANGED THAT,
CONTROLLING AND DILUTING

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.500
THE FLOW OF THE CURRENT
IN ITS IMMENSE RESERVOIR

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.660
AND ENABLING
HEAVY CARGO SHIPS

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:54.800
TO NAVIGATE DEEP
INTO CHINA'S HEARTLAND.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.730
THE HUGE PHYSICAL BARRIER WHICH
THE DAM POSES TO TRAFFIC IS

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:05.400
COUNTERED BY THE MOST COMPLEX
SYSTEM OF LOCKS EVER BUILT.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.430
FOR SHIPS TRAVELING THROUGH
THESE LOCKS IT'S A FIVE-STAGE

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.200
FOUR HOUR RIDE THROUGH
THE CEMENT CORRIDORS

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.430
FROM ONE LEVEL OF
THE RIVER TO THE OTHER.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.500
THE SYSTEM ALLOWS 10,000-TON
CARGO SHIPS TO TRAVEL 2,000

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:24.400
KILOMETERS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
ALONG THE RIVER'S COURSE.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.860
RIVER TRAFFIC ON THE
YANGTZE IS SET TO INCREASE

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:32.930
FROM TEN MILLION TO 50
MILLION TONS PER YEAR.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.630
THIS WATER SUPERHIGHWAY
IS REVITALIZING CHINA'S

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.700
INLAND PROVINCES
WHERE GIGANTIC CITIES

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.060
WITH POPULATIONS OF TENS
OF MILLIONS ARE TAKING SHAPE.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.060
THE DAM NOT ONLY LINKS THESE
CITIES TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD,

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:52.130
IT QUITE LITERALLY
POWERS THEIR GROWTH.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:57.430
BY HARNESSING THE RIVER CURRENT,
THE DAM CREATES PRODIGIOUS

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:02.600
AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICITY,
CRUCIAL TO A BOOMING ECONOMY.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.000
THIS IS THE LARGEST
HYDRO-ELECTRIC POWER PLANT

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.660
EVER BUILT.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.330
WHEN IT'S AT FULL CAPACITY THE
DAM'S TURBINES WILL CREATE

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:18.200
AS MUCH ENERGY AS 18
NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.460
SUPPORTERS OF THE DAM
CLAIM ITS CLEAN ELECTRICITY

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.360
IS CRUCIAL IN CUTTING CARBON
POLLUTION AND REDUCING

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.730
CHINA'S DEPENDENCY
ON FOSSIL FUELS.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:33.030
BUT MANY PEOPLE
ARE UNCONVINCED.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:37.000
FROM THE OUTSET, THE THREE
GORGES PROJECT HAS CAUSED

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.100
MASS PROTEST, THE LIKE
OF WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:45.730
WITNESSED IN
COMMUNIST CHINA.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.760
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT LIES AT THE
HEART OF THE PROTESTORS' FEARS

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.400
WE MUST TRAVEL UPSTREAM INTO
AN ANCIENT LANDSCAPE THAT

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.430
HAS BEEN IRREVOCABLY CHANGED
TO FIND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:04.430
WHO'S HOMES AND HISTORY HAVE
BEEN DESTROYED BY THE DAM.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.860
THE THREE GORGES REGION
HAS LONG BEEN RENOWNED

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.130
FOR ITS
SPECTACULAR LANDSCAPE.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.530
BEFORE THE DAM THIS WAS
CHARACTERIZED BY 100-METER

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:29.900
CANYONS THROUGH WHICH THE
YANGTZE RIVER CUT ITS PATH.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:35.700
TODAY MUCH OF THE MOST DRAMATIC
LANDSCAPE HAS DISAPPEARED

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:42.300
BENEATH THE RISING WATERS OF THE
DAM'S 650 KILOMETER RESERVOIR.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:49.800
CHANGED, TOO, ARE THE
LIVES OF THE PEOPLE.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.830
120 KILOMETERS
UPSTREAM OF THE DAM,

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.860
THE RESIDENTS OF WUSHAN
TOWN HAVE FIRST HAND

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:02.760
EXPERIENCE OF THE HUGE
SOCIAL UPHEAVAL IT HAS CAUSED.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.530
WHEN THE DAM FIRST
BECAME OPERATIONAL IN 2004,

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:11.460
WATER LEVELS IN THIS
REGION ROSE BY 50 METERS,

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.230
SUBMERGING PRACTICALLY
ALL OF OLD WUSHAN.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:19.230
IT'S A DRASTIC CHANGE WHICH
THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:24.260
ARE KEEN TO JUSTIFY.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.960
TRANSLATOR: WUSHAN
IS A NEW MIGRANT CITY.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.130
MOST OF THE OLD CITY
IS NOW UNDER WATER.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:36.100
IT'S BECOME A
SPECTACULAR VIEW.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.100
>>THOUGH HE LIVED IN THE
OLD CITY, CHEN CHIANG WAS ONE

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.830
OF THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
CHARGED WITH COORDINATING

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:54.430
THE EVACUATION OF ITS RESIDENTS
TO THE NEW CITY FURTHER UPHILL.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:59.600
TRANSLATOR: THIS MIGRATION
TOOK FOUR STAGES TO COMPLETE.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.430
SO THIS NEW CITY
WAS NOT COMPLETED

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:05.200
IN JUST ONE
OR TWO YEARS.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.200
WE HAD TO FIRSTLY SET A SMALL
AREA TO USE AS A TESTING POINT

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.160
AND THEN MOVE
PEOPLE GRADUALLY.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.360
BY NOW WE HAVE ABOUT 30
TO 40 THOUSAND MIGRANTS

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:24.360
LIVING IN
THIS NEW CITY.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.260
>>TODAY THE REINVENTION
OF WUSHAN CONTINUES

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.930
AS THE LAST REMNANTS
OF THE OLD TOWN

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.730
ARE DESTROYED TO
MAKE WAY FOR THE NEW.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.930
THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS
THAT THIS CHANGE IS GOOD,

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.530
BRINGING WUSHAN
INTO THE 21ST CENTURY.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.730
MANY LOCALS DISAGREE.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.330
SOME STILL CLING TO
THEIR OLD WAY OF LIFE,

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.960
TENDING THEIR SHRINKING
FARMLAND AMONG THE

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.860
EVER-ENCROACHING
HIGH RISE BLOCKS.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.300
BUT IN A COUNTRY WHERE
PUBLIC PROTEST AGAINST THE DAM

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.300
HAS BEEN
FORCIBLY SUPPRESSED,

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:04.560
THESE PEOPLES' VOICES
WILL BE DROWNED OUT TOO.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:10.830
TRANSLATOR: THIS EMPTY FIELD
BEHIND WILL ALSO BE DEVELOPED

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.460
AS PART OF THE NEW CITY.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.360
IT'LL BE USED
UP VERY QUICKLY.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:23.260
THIS WILL BE A COMMUNITY
PLAZA IN THE FUTURE.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:28.800
>>THESE FARMERS' HOMES STAND
DIRECTLY IN THE PATH OF PROGRESS

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.660
AND IN THE END THEY'LL HAVE
NO CHOICE BUT TO MOVE.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.200
FOR IN CHINA, ALL LAND
IS OWNED BY THE STATE.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.260
CITIZENS LEASE
THEIR PROPERTIES

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.660
FROM THE GOVERNMENT ON
A LONG-TERM AGREEMENT.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.660
BUT THE AUTHORITIES CAN
RENEGE ON THE DEAL AT ANY TIME,

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.260
AND, IF THEY WISH,
SUBMERGE ENTIRE CITIES

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:53.160
FOR THE SAKE OF
CREATING A NEW CHINA.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.560
SO FAR THE RISING WATERS
HAVE ENGULFED A STAGGERING

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:03.900
13 CITIES, 140 TOWNS,
AND OVER 1,300 VILLAGES.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.500
UP TO TWO MILLION PEOPLE HAVE
HAD THEIR HOMES REPOSSESSED

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.700
IN THE NAME OF PROGRESS.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.030
ONE IN FIVE HAVE BEEN MOVED
TO DIFFERENT PROVINCES

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:20.900
WHERE DIALECT, CLIMATE,
EVEN DIET ARE DIFFERENT.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.900
MANY MORE HAVE WATCHED
THEIR LIVELIHOODS DISAPPEAR

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:28.500
ALONG WITH
THEIR HOMES.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.800
SUNG TSE-ILAM OWNS A
CHARTER BOAT SERVICE

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.060
OPERATING FROM
WUSHAN DOCKS.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.700
TODAY SHE FERRIES THE TOURISTS
WHO FLOCK TO SEE WHAT'S LEFT OF

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:43.160
THE BEAUTIFUL GORGES ALONG THE
YANGTZE AND ITS TRIBUTARIES.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.130
A FEW YEARS AGO, HOWEVER,
TSE-ILAM WOULD HAVE BEEN A

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:51.200
LIVING PART OF THE LANDSCAPE
WHICH IS NOW UNDER WATER.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.200
TRANSLATOR: BEFORE WE OWNED
THIS TOURIST BOAT COMPANY

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:59.900
WE OWNED A FAMILY INN IN JIN
DE ZHENG AND WE WERE FARMING.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:04.130
>>WHEN THE THREE GORGES
RESERVOIR BEGAN TO FILL,

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:07.160
TSE-ILAM'S FARMHOUSE WAS
AMONG THE FIRST BUILDINGS

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.230
TO BE SUBMERGED.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.260
AS THE WATERS ROSE AROUND
HER, SHE WAS RELOCATED

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.530
TO A NEW HOME
UPON THE HILL.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:20.900
IT WAS TO BE THE FIRST OF MANY
MOVES TO AVOID THE RISING TIDES.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.460
TRANSLATOR: WE'VE MOVED
THREE TIMES, HAVEN'T WE?

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:28.260
ONCE IN 1997 WHEN THE RIVER
WAS CUT OFF, AND ONCE IN 2003,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.060
AND THEN ONCE
MORE IN 2005.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.460
WE HAD TO MOVE
EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:37.300
IT INVOLVED A LOT OF
COST AND EFFORT.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.460
>>DESPITE HER PERSONAL
TRIALS, THE GOVERNMENT

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.000
SEES TSE-ILAM AS
A SUCCESS STORY.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.230
SHE'S MADE THE MOST OF
THE OPPORTUNITIES AND

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.030
FINANCIAL COMPENSATION
OFFERED BY THE AUTHORITIES

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:58.100
TO CREATE A NEW
LIFE FOR HERSELF.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:02.600
NOT EVERYONE HAS
ADAPTED SO WELL.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.430
MANY OLDER PEOPLE ARE
UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.260
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
RETRAINING WHICH IS AVAILABLE.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.400
AND A LIFETIME WORKING THE
LAND LEAVES THEM ILL EQUIPPED

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:18.930
TO DEAL WITH THE
CONFINES OF URBAN LIVING.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.300
EVEN THOSE WHO HAVE BOUGHT IN
TO CHINA'S VISION OF THE FUTURE

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.100
FIND IT DIFFICULT TO
FORGET THE PAST.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.400
TRANSLATOR: I DO MISS
MY OLD HOME A LITTLE.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.300
I CAN'T FORGET THE TIME
WHEN I USED TO FARM

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.600
AND RUN THE
FAMILY INN.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:39.660
THE MEMORIES OF SERVING GUESTS -
THOSE DAYS WERE REALLY RELAXING.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.760
>>IT'S NOT ONLY RECENT HISTORY
WHICH HAS BEEN WIPED AWAY

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:55.760
BY THE RISING WATERS, SO
TOO HAS THE ANCIENT PAST.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.000
THE YANGTZE RIVER BASIN
IS THE TRADITIONAL HOME

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.330
OF THE GREAT DYNASTIES
AND KINGDOMS OF OLD ASIA.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:08.330
THE NATURAL BARRIER CREATED BY
THE RIVER MADE IT AN IMPORTANT

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:13.800
POLITICAL BOUNDARY AND THE
SCENE OF MANY HISTORIC BATTLES.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.660
THE THREE GORGES REGION
IS PARTICULARLY RICH

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.260
IN DYNASTIC
ARCHITECTURE.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:25.230
MANY EMPERORS BUILT GREAT
TEMPLES ON THE STEEP RIVERBANKS.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.760
WHEN THE WATER LEVELS BEGAN TO
RISE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.760
FUNDED A $125 MILLION PROJECT TO
SAVE THE MOST IMPORTANT SITES

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.760
FROM BEING SUBMERGED.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.060
IN WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE
BIGGEST HISTORICAL SALVAGE

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.260
OPERATION EVER, ENTIRE BUILDINGS
WERE METICULOUSLY CATALOGUED

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:48.560
AND MOVED PIECE BY
PIECE TO HIGHER GROUND.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.200
BUT MANY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
RELICS COULD NOT BE SAVED

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.760
BECAUSE THEY LAY EMBEDDED
IN THE VERY LANDSCAPE

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.760
WHICH WAS TO
BE SUBMERGED.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.160
BEFORE THE BUILDING OF THE DAM,
THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSIONED

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.600
A MAJOR ARCHEOLOGICAL
SURVEY OF THIS AREA.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.500
PEI XIANG WAS CHIEF
COORDINATOR OF THE PROJECT

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.330
IN THE WUSHAN REGION.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.030
MUCH OF HIS RESEARCH
FOCUSED ON THE BO PEOPLE,

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.400
AN ANCIENT CIVILIZATION THAT
LIVED ON THE STEEP SLOPES OF

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.400
THE YANGTZE AND ITS TRIBUTARIES
SOME 2,000 YEARS AGO.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.030
THE MOST IMPRESSIVE EVIDENCE
OF ANCIENT BO CULTURE

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:36.360
IS TO BE SEEN IN THE CLIFFS
HIGH ABOVE THE RIVER.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.000
TRANSLATOR: WE ARE
NOW ON THE RIVER.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.960
WE CAN SEE A COFFIN SET
HIGH IN THE CLIFF UP THERE.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:49.060
>>HOW THE BO PEOPLE
MANAGED TO LAY THEIR DEAD

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:53.530
IN THEIR FINAL RESTING
PLACE IS A MYSTERY.

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:58.160
EXACTLY WHY THEY DID
SO IS ALSO UNKNOWN.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.360
TRANSLATOR: THERE ARE
TWO EXPLANATIONS.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.460
THE FIRST IS THAT THE BO'S
DESCENDANTS WANTED TO HONOR

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.330
THEIR ANCESTORS AND SO BURIED
THEIR BODIES IN A HIGH PLACE.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:14.400
THE SECOND EXPLANATION IS THAT
THEY DID IT TO AVOID VANDALISM.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.260
>>THE BO PEOPLE COULDN'T
POSSIBLY HAVE IMAGINED

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.430
THAT ULTIMATELY IT WOULDN'T
BE THIEVES WHO WOULD STEAL

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:29.660
THEIR ANCESTORS' REMAINS,
BUT THE RIVER ITSELF.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:33.760
WHEN THE WATERS BEGAN TO
RISE IN 1998, ARCHAEOLOGISTS

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.800
WERE JUST BEGINNING TO DEVELOP
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.960
OF THE CULTURAL WEALTH
OF BO CIVILIZATION.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:45.700
BUT THEIR DISCOVERIES CAME
TOO LATE TO STOP THE FLOODING.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.830
WHILE SOME COFFINS HAVE BEEN
RESCUED AND REMOVED TO MUSEUMS,

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.230
MANY MORE HAVE SIMPLY
BEEN SUBMERGED.

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.460
IN TOTAL, OVER A THOUSAND
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.230
HAVE BEEN LOST AS
THE WATERS HAVE RISEN.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.630
BUT THE UNIQUE HERITAGE OF
THIS REGION HAS NEVER BEEN

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:14.230
MORE CRUCIAL TO ITS SURVIVAL.
AS THE RICH FARMLANDS

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.430
ON THE LOWER RIVERBANKS
HAVE DISAPPEARED UNDERWATER,

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:23.930
SO TOO HAVE
PEOPLES' LIVELIHOODS.

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:29.560
THE GOVERNMENT SEES TOURISM AS
PROVIDING A REPLACEMENT INCOME

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.000
AND HAS POURED MONEY
INTO ENTICING VISITORS

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.030
TO THE THREE
GORGES REGION

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:39.600
USING ITS HISTORY AS A
UNIQUE SELLING POINT.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:47.100
ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR
TOURS IS A TRIP UPRIVER,

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:52.500
TRADITIONAL STYLE.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.500
BEFORE THE THREE GORGES
RESERVOIR WAS CREATED,

00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.460
PARTS OF THE YANGTZE AND ITS
TRIBUTARIES RAN TOO SHALLOW

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:04.100
FOR HEAVY CARGO TO
SAIL THE RIVER'S LENGTH.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:09.130
BIG SHIPS HAD TO BE
DRAGGED UPSTREAM BY HAND.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:13.000
MEN KNOWN AS TRACKERS WERE
EMPLOYED TO PULL BARGES ALONG

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.560
USING NOTHING BUT HUMAN
EFFORT AND HEAVY ROPE.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.600
TODAY TOURISTS PAY FOR THIS
PICTURE POSTCARD EXPERIENCE

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.930
OF LIFE ON THE
OLD YANGTZE.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.560
UPSTREAM, HOWEVER, A NEW CHINA
IS EMERGING TO REPLACE THE OLD -

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:43.360
A CHINA CHARACTERIZED BY MEGA
CITIES AND MEGA PROGRESS.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.530
THIS COUNTRY IS URBANIZING
FASTER THAN ANYWHERE IN HISTORY

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:55.830
AND THE YANGTZE IS AT THE HEART
OF THIS MASSIVE SOCIAL CHANGE.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:25:00.530
SOME PEOPLE ARE
EMBRACING THE CHANGES.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:04.500
OTHERS ARE
STRUGGLING TO KEEP PACE.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.830
AS IS THE RIVER ITSELF.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.560

MOUNTAIN CITY OF CHONGQING,

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:29.030
SYMBOL OF CHINA'S
BRAVE NEW WORLD.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:32.530
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THE
AREA COVERED BY THE CITY

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.830
HAS MORE
THAN DOUBLED.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:38.260
SO, TOO, HAS
THE POPULATION.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:42.860
NOW THE MUNICIPALITY OF
CHONGQING IS HOME TO A

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:48.130
STAGGERING 30 MILLION
PEOPLE, AND RISING.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:51.700
THIS IS THE FASTEST GROWING
URBAN CENTER ON THE PLANET.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.760
TO KEEP PACE, THE CITY
MAP NEEDS TO BE REDRAWN

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.460
EVERY THREE MONTHS.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.100
CHONGQING IS AT THE FOREFRONT
OF WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CALLS

"THE GREAT WESTERN
DEVELOPMENT".

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.800

ONE PART OF THIS MULTIBILLION

DOLLAR STRATEGY TO REVITALIZE
CHINA'S HEARTLAND.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.360
AS WELL AS INVESTING IN
ROADS, BRIDGES, AND DAMS,

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.060
THE GOVERNMENT MUST
CREATE SOME 24 MILLION

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.530
NEW JOBS EVERY YEAR JUST
TO KEEP THE COUNTRY'S

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:24.060
EVER-INCREASING
POPULATION IN WORK.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.700
IN A REGION WHERE SO
MUCH HAS BEEN SACRIFICED

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.500
TO MAKE WAY FOR PROGRESS,
A BOOMING ECONOMY

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:11.860
ARE ALSO
SERIOUSLY POLLUTED.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:20.900
THE PROBLEM IS CLEARLY EVIDENT
IN THE SUBURBS OF CHONGQING.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:24.330
TRANSLATOR: THIS STREAM IS
CALLED "CLEARWATER" STREAM,

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.860
BUT NOW YOU CAN
SEE IT'S POLLUTED.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:30.900
APPROXIMATELY 60,000
TO 80,000 TONS OF SEWAGE

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:34.160
ENTERS THIS
STREAM EVERY DAY.

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:38.300
THIS STREAM FLOWS INTO THE
JIALING RIVER WHICH THEN FLOWS

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:44.260
INTO THE YANGTZE, FIFTEEN
KILOMETERS DOWNSTREAM.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:48.800
>>IN THE PAST, PEOPLE ASSUMED
THE YANGTZE WAS TOO BIG

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.800
TO POISON AS ANY TOXINS WERE
FLUSHED AWAY BY THE 900 BILLION

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.630
TONS OF WATER THAT FLOWED
THROUGH THE RIVER EVERY YEAR.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.330
BUT THE RESERVOIR CREATED
BY THE THREE GORGES DAM

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:03.430
HAS ALTERED
THAT CURRENT.

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:06.230
WHILE THE SPEED OF THE
WATER ON THE RIVER'S SURFACE

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.060
HAS INCREASED, THE
VELOCITY OF THE FLOW BENEATH

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.560
HAS FALLEN TO
PRACTICALLY ZERO.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.560
THE RIVER CAN NO LONGER
CARRY WASTE AWAY FROM THE CITY

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:20.630
AND IT NOW ACCUMULATES
IN A STAGNANT RESERVOIR.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:23.030
A POLLUTED YANGTZE
SPELLS DISASTER

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:24.960
FOR THE LOCAL
POPULATION.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.430
THIS RIVER PROVIDES DRINKING
WATER TO 400 MILLION PEOPLE -

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:32.300
THAT'S ONE IN EVERY
15 ON THE PLANET.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.960
THE POLLUTED WATER HAS
BEEN BLAMED FOR UNUSUALLY

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.200
HIGH RATES OF CANCER
AND BIRTH DEFECTS

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.660
AMONG PEOPLE WHO
LIVE NEAR THE YANGTZE.

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.130
THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS
YANGTZE WATER IS SAFE TO DRINK,

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:49.560
XUE DONG MING STILL CHOOSES
TO HIKE FOUR HOURS EVERY WEEK

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.660
TO DRAW HIS OWN SUPPLY
FROM A MOUNTAIN SPRING.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.500
TRANSLATOR: THIS
WATER IS VERY NATURAL.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.930
IT COMES FROM THE RAIN AND IS
FILTERED THROUGH THE FOREST.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:03.930
IT'S SPRING WATER;
IT'S VERY GOOD.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.460
>>BUT SPRING WATER IS A
LUXURY THE POOREST URBAN

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.330
MASSES OF CHINA
SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD.

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:20.560
LONG HOURS OF HARD LABOR LEAVE
NO TIME FOR WATER GATHERING.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:26.430
NEITHER DO THE PEOPLE
KNOW HOW MUCH THE WATERWAY

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:30.160
THEY LIVE ALONG
HAS BEEN DAMAGED.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:37.200
THIS IS TRUE FOR EVERY KILOMETER
OF THE RIVER'S COURSE.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:43.630
AS IT LEAVES CHONGQING, FORGING
ITS WAY DOWNSTREAM TOWARDS

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:47.200
THE EAST CHINA SEA, IT
BECOMES EVER MORE APPARENT

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:52.330
THAT THE YANGTZE IS OVER
USED AND UNDER THREAT.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:55.900
THE THREAT IS SO SEVERE THAT
IT'S CAUSING THE RIVER TO FAIL

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:59.860
IN ITS AGE-OLD FUNCTION
OF FEEDING THE PEOPLE.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:03.200
IT'S EVEN CAUSING THE RIVER
TO EAT AWAY AT THE SHORELINE,

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.530
POTENTIALLY DESTROYING THE VERY
CITIES IT HAS HELPED CREATE.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.630
ONE-THIRD OF THE WAY ALONG ITS
SEAWARD JOURNEY FROM CHONGQING

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:19.760
THE YANGTZE COMES UP AGAINST
THE GIGANTIC PHYSICAL BARRIER

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.560
OF THE THREE
GORGES DAM.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.200
THE EFFECT OF THE WATER
FLOW MEETING THIS STRUCTURE

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.630
IS LIKE A SPEEDING CAR
HITTING A CONCRETE WALL.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:32.360
THE RIVER AND ALL THAT'S
CARRIED ALONG IN ITS WATERS

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:36.630
ARE STOPPED DEAD
IN THEIR TRACKS.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:40.560
THE DAM IS A FEAT
OF ENGINEERING

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:45.000
OF WHICH THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT IS VERY PROUD.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.130
TOURISTS ARE WELCOME
TO THE SITE TO MARVEL AT

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:55.360
WHAT'S NICKNAMED
CHINA'S "NEW GREAT WALL".

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:59.560
DURING THE OFFICIAL
TOUR, VISITORS ARE TOLD

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:05.000
THE SUCCESS STORY OF
THE BUILDING OF THE DAM.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.830
BUT DEEP INSIDE THIS STRUCTURE
A DIFFERENT STORY IS EMERGING,

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:13.130
REVEALING A MASSIVE FLAW
IN THE THREE GORGES PLAN.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.760
FOR WHILE THE WATER CAN
STILL CONTINUE DOWNSTREAM

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.130
THROUGH THE DAM, THE
SAME CANNOT BE SAID ABOUT

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:28.930
THE LIFE-GIVING SILT
CARRIED IN THE RIVER'S FLOW.

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:31.860
THE YANGTZE IS ONE OF THE
MOST SEDIMENT-RICH RIVERS

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.260
IN THE WORLD.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:36.630
IT IS SILT WHICH GIVES THE RIVER
ITS MURKY BROWN COLOR AND,

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:39.900
DEPOSITED BY THE CURRENT, IT
HAS SHAPED THIS LANDSCAPE

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.200
FOR THOUSANDS
OF YEARS.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:45.800
SPECIAL SILT VALVES ARE
BUILT INTO THE DAM WALL

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.400
TO ALLOW THE SEDIMENT
TO FLUSH THROUGH.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.700
BUT THE SHEER AMOUNT
OF SILT PRESENTS A HUGE

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:57.230
TECHNICAL CHALLENGE.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:01.130
THE SYSTEM STRUGGLES TO COPE
AS AN AVERAGE OF 140 MILLION

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:06.260
TONS OF SILT ARE TRAPPED
BEHIND THE DAM EVERY YEAR.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:10.260
AT THIS RATE, SEDIMENT BUILD-UP
IN THE BOTTOM OF THE RESERVOIR

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.900
WILL RAISE THE WATER
LEVELS UPSTREAM, SEVERELY

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:17.100
INCREASING THE THREAT OF
FLOODING IN CHONGQING.

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.800
THERE IS EVEN TALK OF, YET
AGAIN, FORCIBLY RESETTLING

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.360
A MILLION PEOPLE FROM THIS
AREA TO HIGHER GROUND,

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:27.030
OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:30.400
BUT IT'S AT THE END OF THE
RIVER'S COURSE THAT THE MOST

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.960
DRAMATIC ILL-EFFECTS OF THE
TRAPPED SILT BECOME APPARENT.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.960
A THOUSAND KILOMETERS
DOWNSTREAM OF THE DAM,

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:43.500
THE CITY OF SHANGHAI SITS AT
THE MOUTH OF THE YANGTZE DELTA.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:50.400
A GLITTERING TESTAMENT TO
CHINA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH,

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:54.060
THIS BUSTLING PORT IS
BUILT QUITE LITERALLY

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:58.330
ON THE WEALTH
OF THE RIVER.

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:02.060
OVER TWO-THIRDS OF THE CITY'S
FOUNDATIONS ARE BUILT ON SILT

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:11.000
DEPOSITED HERE BY THE YANGTZE
OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.830
YANG XIALING IS A GEOLOGIST
WHO LEADS A RESEARCH PROJECT

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:19.500
ON SILT LEVELS IN
THE YANGTZE RIVER.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:25.060
MUCH OF HIS RESEARCH IS FOCUSED
ON THE ISLAND OF CHONGMING.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:29.260
LYING NORTH OF SHANGHAI'S CITY
CENTER, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.130
OF THE YANGTZE RIVER
CHANNEL, THIS ENTIRE ISLAND

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:35.430
OWES ITS EXISTENCE
TO RIVER SILT.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:40.000
TRANSLATOR: FIFTY YEARS AGO THIS
PLACE WAS COVERED BY WATER.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.260
THERE WERE NO PLANTS
GROWING HERE.

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:44.830
THE REASON IT EXISTS
NOW IS BECAUSE OF SILT

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:47.730
FROM THE YANGTZE RIVER.
ONCE THE SILT PILED UP

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:51.260
TO A CERTAIN HEIGHT,
PLANTS BEGAN TO GROW.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.730

CONSERVATION AREA.

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:03.900
INCREDIBLY RICH IN WILDLIFE,
THEY PROVIDE A CRUCIAL

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.800
STOP-OFF POINT FOR
MIGRATORY BIRDS TRAVELING

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:11.560
FROM THE SOUTHERN TO
THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:16.200
THEY'RE ALSO A VITAL BREEDING
GROUND FOR MANY AQUATIC ANIMALS.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:20.400
BUT ONLY A FRACTION OF THE
YANGTZE'S SILT WETLANDS

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.960
ARE GIVEN
OVER TO NATURE.

AS CHINA'S ECONOMIC CAPITAL,
SHANGHAI IS GROWING FAST.

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:38.760

DENSELY POPULATED REGIONS

BOASTING SOME OF THE
MOST EXPENSIVE REAL ESTATE

CITY ALREADY HAS

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.260
NEARLY TWICE AS MANY
HIGH RISES AS NEW YORK

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:54.800
AND CONTINUES TO BUILD THEM
AT AN EXTRAORDINARY RATE.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.230
THE GOVERNMENT HOPES THAT THE
RIVER WILL CONTINUE TO REPLENISH

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:02.360
THE COASTLINE, PROVIDING THE
NEW LAND NEEDED FOR EXPANSION.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.060
BUT THERE'S A
FLAW IN THE PLAN.

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:09.060
THERE ISN'T ENOUGH
SILT FOR THE JOB.

OF RECLAIMING MORE LAND

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.900
WILL BE VERY
DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:13.600
WE PROBABLY NEED
TO REVISE THIS PLAN

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:16.700
AND INTRODUCE NEW
METHODS TO PROTECT THE SILT.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.760
FOR EXAMPLE, BUILDING A
BREAKWATER EMBANKMENT.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.660
IT WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE
BECAUSE WE MUST BUILD IT

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:27.060
STRONGER AND
HIGHER THAN BEFORE.

80% OF ALL CHINA'S
FRESHWATER FISH

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:58.530
ARE CAUGHT AT THE RIVER
DELTA HERE IN SHANGHAI.

IMPORTANT BREEDING GROUND

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:12.500
AND PROVIDE A HABITAT
FOR YOUNG FISH TO GROW.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:16.230
>>THE REDUCTION IN
SEDIMENT IS ALSO AFFECTING

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:20.000
THE RIVER'S
DELICATE ECO-SYSTEM.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.360
IT IS THE SILT WHICH FEEDS
THE MICROSCOPIC PLANKTON

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.630
THAT FORMS A VITAL
PART OF THE FOOD CHAIN

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:28.300
AT THE
YANGTZE DELTA.

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:31.460
EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED AT
THE WATER RESEARCH CENTER

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:34.760
SHOW THE DECREASE OF SILT
IS AFFECTING THE AMOUNT

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:38.000
AND VARIETY OF PLANKTON
GROWING IN THE WATERS.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.700
AS CERTAIN TYPES OF
FISH-FRIENDLY PLANKTON

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:43.830
STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE,
DAMAGING SPECIES TAKE OVER

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:49.400
CAUSING BLOOMS OF ALGAE
WHICH ARE TOXIC TO FISH.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:54.530
BUT PERHAPS THE GREATEST THREAT
OF ALL TO THE RIVER'S HEALTH

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:57.730
IS THE AGGRESSIVE
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT

00:45:57.730 --> 00:46:01.600
WHICH IS SWAMPING
ITS WATERS.

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.260
THE NEW LOCK SYSTEM AT
THE THREE GORGES DAM

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.830
HAS IMPROVED THE
NAVIGABILITY OF THE YANGTZE.

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:09.300
AS A RESULT, THE
AMOUNT OF RIVER TRAFFIC

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.830
HAS DRAMATICALLY
INCREASED.

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:15.730
SHANGHAI IS NOW THE
WORLD'S BUSIEST PORT,

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:20.400
TRANSPORTING OVER 443 MILLION
TONS OF CARGO ANNUALLY.

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.300
BUT THE INCREDIBLE
INCREASE IN VOLUME OF SHIPS

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:27.330
SPELLS DISASTER
FOR WILDLIFE.

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:30.530
ANY CREATURE TRYING TO
CROSS THESE CROWDED WATERS

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:34.660
WOULD BE LIKE A RABBIT
CROSSING A 12-LANE HIGHWAY.

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:37.060
THE POLLUTION WHICH IS A
BYPRODUCT OF THE SHIPPING

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:40.660
INDUSTRY ALSO POSES
A DEADLY THREAT.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:44.830
TRANSLATOR: THE
DIRECT EFFECTS ARE NOISE,

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:47.030
WASTE POLLUTION,
AND TRAFFIC COLLISIONS

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:50.760
WHICH CAUSE TOXIC
WASTE TO BE DISCHARGED.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:54.260
THOSE ARE THE
DIRECT EFFECTS.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:58.800
THE INDIRECT EFFECTS ARISE
FROM MAINTAINING THE RIVER'S

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.460
SHIPPING ROUTE, WHICH
HAS TO BE DREDGED.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:04.960
TO MAINTAIN THE YANGTZE'S
DEEP RIVER PATHWAY,

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.960
A CHANNEL 80 TO 90
KILOMETERS LONG,

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:13.060
300 METERS WIDE AND TEN
METERS DEEP HAS TO BE DUG.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:17.800
THIS IS DETRIMENTAL
TO THE FISH'S HABITAT.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:22.660
>>THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF SILT
LOSS AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:25.560
HAVE HAD SUCH A DRAMATIC
IMPACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.930
HAS BEEN FORCED TO IMPOSE
A SEASONAL FISHING BAN

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:30.700
ON PARTS OF
THE RIVER.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:33.300
EVEN WHEN THEY ARE
ALLOWED TO CAST THEIR NETS,

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.630
FISHERMEN WHO USED TO
MAKE A HANDSOME LIVING

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:39.730
OFTEN RETURN TO SHORE
WITH A MEAGER HARVEST.

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:44.830
MANY NATIVE SPECIES WHICH
WERE ONCE A COMMON CATCH

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:49.830
ARE IN DANGER OF BECOMING
MUSEUM SPECIMENS.

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:52.100
ONE FISH ON THE
BRINK OF DISAPPEARING

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:56.200
IS CHINA'S ICONIC
RIVER STURGEON.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:00.760
ONCE THE STAPLE DIET OF LOCALS,
THESE MASSIVE FISH CAN GROW

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:06.430
UP TO FOUR METERS IN LENGTH
AND WEIGH OVER 450 KILOS.

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:12.430
TRANSLATOR: RECENT HUMAN
DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGES IN THE

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:16.560
ENVIRONMENT HAVE SERIOUSLY
AFFECTED THESE FISH.

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.930
THEIR NUMBERS HAVE
DECLINED RAPIDLY

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:23.900
AND THEY ARE
CLOSE TO DYING OUT.

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:26.930
>>TO PREVENT THE RIVER STURGEON
FROM DISAPPEARING COMPLETELY,

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:28.900
THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT HAS FUNDED

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:32.130
A MAJOR
CONSERVATION PROJECT.

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:36.200
PARTS OF THE WETLANDS HAVE BEEN
MADE DESIGNATED BREEDING GROUNDS

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.600
AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
STURGEON FRY ARE RELEASED

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:43.100
INTO THE WATER TO HELP
REPLENISH DWINDLING NUMBERS.

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:47.130
LOCAL FISHERMEN ARE NOW OBLIGED
TO RETURN ANY STURGEON CAUGHT

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:49.230
BACK TO THE WATER.

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:52.630
BUT THESE EFFORTS MAY
BE TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE.

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:57.160
EXPERTS FEAR THAT THE RIVER
STURGEON IS DESTINED TO SUFFER

00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:00.660
THE SAME FATE AS THE BAIJI
DOLPHIN, AN AQUATIC SPECIES

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:04.060
UNIQUE TO THE YANGTZE WHICH WAS
DECLARED FUNCTIONALLY EXTINCT

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:09.830
IN DECEMBER 2006.

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:12.730
THE BAIJI'S DISAPPEARANCE
AND THE DRASTIC DECLINE

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:15.030
OF FISH LIFE IN THE
YANGTZE ARE INDICATIVE

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:19.300
OF THE FAILING HEALTH
OF THEIR HABITAT.

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:23.100
AT SHANGHAI IT'S CLEAR THAT
THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:25.660
OF HUMAN INTERVENTION
ALONG THE RIVER'S COURSE

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:29.230
HAVE MADE THE
YANGTZE SICK.

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:33.930
AS IT APPROACHES THE END OF ITS
LONG JOURNEY THROUGH THE LAND

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:37.930
THE RIVER REACHES A
CRITICAL TURNING POINT.

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:41.330
THE THREE GORGES DAM HAS
CAUSED CHANGE AND PROGRESS

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:45.830
ALONG EVERY KILOMETER
OF THE YANGTZE'S ROUTE.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:49.500
BUT IT HAS ALSO SPAWNED
A RATE OF DEVELOPMENT

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:54.560
WHICH THE RIVER CANNOT
PHYSICALLY SUSTAIN.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.000
AS THE TREND CONTINUES,
70% OF THESE WATERS

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.630
COULD BE CLASSED
UNUSABLE WITHIN FIVE YEARS.

00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:04.730
IF THE YANGTZE IS
EVER TO RECOVER,

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:08.630
DRASTIC CHANGE
IS NEEDED.

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:11.360
BUT NOW THE PATH TO
PROGRESS HAS BEEN SET.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.600
THE RIVER AND THE
PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON IT

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:17.930
ARE TRAPPED IN A POISONOUS
CYCLE OF GROWTH.

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:24.330
IT WAS INITALLY PREDICTED
THAT THE THREE GORGES

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:26.960
POWER STATION WOULD
PRODUCE ENOUGH ELECTRICITY

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:30.200
TO MEET A TENTH
OF CHINA'S NEEDS.

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.600
BUT THE PACE OF DEVELOPMENT
HAS EXCEEDED ALL EXPECTATION

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:38.030
AND DEMAND ALREADY
OUTSTRIPS SUPPLY.

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:39.500
TO SOLVE
THE PROBLEM,

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:43.330
YET MORE DAMS ARE
PLANNED FOR THE YANGTZE.

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:45.660
THE WEALTH AND THE
FUTURE OF CHINA

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:50.100
CONTINUE TO DEPEND ON
THIS INCREDIBLE RIVER.

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:53.660
BUT WHAT THAT FUTURE HOLDS
FOR THE RIVER AND ITS PEOPLE

00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:55.660
REMAINS TO BE SEEN.
