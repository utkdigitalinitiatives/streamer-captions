00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.830


2
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.270
Agamemnon, howif he had boils?

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.700
full, all over, generally?

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.470
Thersites!

5
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.600
And those boils did run? say so:did not the general run then?

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.770
were not that a botchy core?

7
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.930
Dog!

8
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.800
Then would come some matterfrom him; I see none now.

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.600
Thou bitch-wolf's son,canst thou not hear?

10
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.000
Feel, then.

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.500
The plague of Greece upon thee,thou mongrel beef-witted lord!

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.770
Speak then, thouvinewedst leaven, speak:

13
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.130
I will beat theeinto handsomeness.

14
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.730
I shall sooner rail theeinto wit and holiness:

15
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.470
but, I think, thy horsewill sooner con an oration

16
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.300
than thou learn a prayer withoutbook. Thou canst strike,

17
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.600
canst thou? a red murraino' thy jade's tricks!

18
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.230
Toadstool, learn me theproclamation.

19
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.070
Dost thou think I have nosense, thou strikest me thus?

20
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.470
The proclamation!

21
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.670
Thou art proclaimed afool, I think.

22
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.670
Do not, porpentine, donot: my fingers itch.

23
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.930
I would thou didst itchfrom head to foot

24
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.330
and I had thescratching of thee;

25
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.100
I would make thee theloathsomest scab in Greece.

26
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.730
I say, the proclamation!

27
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.530
Thou grumblest and railestevery hour on Achilles,

28
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.800
and thou art as full of envyat his greatness as Cerberus

29
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.270
is at Proserpine's beauty,

30
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.970
Mistress Thersites!

31
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.000
Thou shouldest strike him.

32
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.300
He would pun thee intoshivers with his fist,

33
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.370
as a sailor breaks a biscuit.

34
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.730
You whoreson cur!

35
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.730
Do, do.

36
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.130
Thou stool for a witch!

37
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.930
Ay, do, do; thousodden-witted lord!

38
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.830
thou hast no more brain thanI have in mine elbows;

39
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.570
thou art here butto thrash Trojans;

40
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.400
and thou art bought and soldamong those of any wit,

41
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.130
like a barbarian slave.

42
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.270
thou thing of no bowels, thou!

43
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.000
You dog!

44
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.600
You scurvy lord!

45
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.300
You cur!

46
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.530
Why, how now, Ajax!wherefore do you thus?

47
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.070
How now, Thersites!what's the matter, man?

48
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.030
You see him there, do you?

49
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.030
Ay; what's the matter?

50
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.530
Nay, look upon him.

51
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.970
So I do: what's thematter?

52
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.330
Nay, but regard him well.

53
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.130
'Well!' why, I do so.

54
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.800
But yet you looknot well upon him;

55
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.270
for whosoever you takehim to be, he is Ajax.

56
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.530
I know that, fool.

57
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.330
Ay, but that fool knowsnot himself.

58
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.800
Therefore I beat thee.

59
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.430
Lo, lo, lo, lo, whatmodicums of wit he utters!

60
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.230
his evasions haveears thus long.

61
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.470
I have bobbed his brain morethan he has beat my bones:

62
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.500
This lord, Ajax, whowears his wit in his belly

63
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.530
and his guts in his head, I'lltell you what I say of him.

64
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.170
What?

65
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.170
I say, this Ajax--

66
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.100
Nay, good Ajax.

67
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.130
Has not so much wit--

68
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.370
Nay, I must hold you.

69
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.600
As will stop the eyeof Helen's needle,

70
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.430
for whom hecomes to fight.

71
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.470
Will thou set thy wit to afool's?

72
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.470
No, I warrant you; for afools will shame it.

73
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.630
Good words, Thersites.

74
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.900
What's the quarrel?

75
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.700
I bade the vile owl go learn methe tenor of the proclamation,

76
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.370
and he rails upon me.

77
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.670
I serve thee not.

78
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.870
Well, go to, go to.

79
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.770
I serve here voluntarily.

80
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.230
Your last servicewas sufferance,

81
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.630
'twas not voluntary: noman is beaten voluntary:

82
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.370
Ajax was here the voluntary,and you as under an impress.

83
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.170
E'en so; a great deal of yourwit, too, lies in your sinews,

84
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.400
or else there be liars.Hector have a great catch,

85
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.330
if he knock out eitherof your brains:

86
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.430
a' were as good crack afusty nut with no kernel.

87
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.970
What, with me too,Thersites?

88
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.730
There's Ulysses and oldNestor, whose wit was mouldy

89
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.530
ere your grandsires hadnails on their toes,

90
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.200
yoke you like draught-oxen andmake you plough up the wars.

91
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.700
What, what?

92
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.170
Yes, good sooth:

93
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.900
I shall cut out yourtongue.

94
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.770
'Tis no matter! I shall speakas much as thou afterwards.

95
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.570
No more words, Thersites;peace!

96
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.170
I will hold my peace

97
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.870
when Achilles' brachbids me, shall I?

98
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.970
There's for you, Patroclus.

99
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.630
I will see you hanged,like clotpoles,

100
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.200
ere I come any moreto your tents:

101
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.900
I will keep wherethere is wit stirring

102
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.470
and leave thefaction of fools.

103
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.700
A good riddance.

104
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.970
Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'dthrough all our host:

105
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.870
That Hector, by the fifthhour of the sun,

106
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.170
Will with a trumpet callsome knight to arms

107
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.870
That hath a stomach;

108
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.100
and such a one thatdare Maintain

109
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.530
--I know not what:'tis trash. Farewell.

110
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.800
Farewell. Who shall answerhim?

111
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.100
I know not: 'tis put tolottery; otherwise

112
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.500
He knew his man.

113
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.870
O, meaning you. I will golearn more of it.

114
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.570


115
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:44.400
After so many hours,lives, speeches spent,

116
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.400
Thus once again saysNestor from the Greeks:

117
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.070
'Deliver Helen, and alldamage else--

118
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.470
As honour, loss of time,travail, expense,

119
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.600
Wounds, friends, and whatelse dear that is consumed

120
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.130
In hot digestion of thiscormorant war--

121
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:19.370
Shall be struck off.'Hector, what say you to't?

122
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.670
Though no man lesser fearsthe Greeks than I

123
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.000
As far as toucheth myparticular,

124
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.630
Yet, dread Priam,

125
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.830
There is no lady of moresofter bowels,

126
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.500
More spongy to suck in thesense of fear,

127
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.470
More ready to cry out 'Whoknows what follows?'

128
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:47.370
Than Hector is: the woundof peace is surety,

129
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.070
Surety secure; but modestdoubt is call'd

130
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.330
The beacon of the wise,the tent that searches

131
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.670
To the bottom of theworst. Let Helen go:

132
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.370
Since the first sword wasdrawn about this question,

133
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.370
Every tithe soul, 'mongstmany thousand dismes,

134
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.970
Hath been as dear asHelen; I mean, of ours:

135
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.700
If we have lost so manytenths of ours,

136
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.570
To guard a thing not oursnor worth to us,

137
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.070
Had it our name, the valueof one ten,

138
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.400
What merit's in thatreason which denies

139
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.730
The yielding of her up?

140
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.070
Fie, fie, my brother!

141
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.370
Weigh you the worth andhonour of a king

142
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.700
So great as our dreadfather in a scale

143
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.730
Of common ounces? will youwith counters sum

144
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.200
The past proportion of hisinfinite?

145
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.470
And buckle in a scale mostfathomless

146
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.870
With spans and inches sodiminutive

147
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.200
As fears and reasons?

148
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.900
If we talk of reason, Let'sshut our gates and sleep:

149
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.230
manhood and honour Shouldhave hare-hearts,

150
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.130
would they but fattheir thoughts

151
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.370
With this cramm'dreason:

152
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.770
reason and respect Make liverspale and lustihood deject.

153
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.500
Brother, she is not worth whatshe doth cost The keeping.

154
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.130
What is aught, but as 'tisvalued?

155
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.430
But value dwells not inparticular will;

156
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.600
It holds his estimate anddignity

157
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.170
As well wherein 'tisprecious of itself

158
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.100
As in the prizer: 'tis madidolatry

159
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.600
To make the servicegreater than the god

160
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.730
And the will dotes that isattributive

161
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.770
To what infectiouslyitself affects,

162
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.330
Without some image of theaffected merit.

163
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:32.770
I take to-day a wife, andmy election

164
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.300
Is led on in the conductof my will;

165
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.530
My will enkindled by mineeyes and ears,

166
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.170
Two traded pilots 'twixtthe dangerous shores

167
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:47.070
Of will and judgment: howmay I avoid,

168
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.330
Although my will distastewhat it elected,

169
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:56.470
The wife I chose? therecan be no evasion

170
00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:01.000
To blench from this and tostand firm by honour:

171
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.030
We turn not back the silksupon the merchant,

172
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:08.730
When we have soil'd them,nor the remainder viands

173
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.270
We do not throw inunrespective sieve,

174
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:16.900
Because we now are full.It was thought meet

175
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.300
Paris should do somevengeance on the Greeks:

176
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.070
Your breath of fullconsent bellied his sails;

177
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.230
The seas and winds, oldwranglers, took a truce

178
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.030
And did him service: hetouch'd the ports desired,

179
00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.870
And for an old aunt whomthe Greeks held captive,

180
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:35.400
He brought a Grecian queen,whose youth and freshness

181
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.470
Wrinkles Apollo's, andmakes stale the morning.

182
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:47.370
Why keep we her? theGrecians keep our aunt:

183
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:54.070
Is she worth keeping? why,she is a pearl,

184
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.200
Whose price hath launch'dabove a thousand ships,

185
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.930
And turn'd crown'd kingsto merchants.

186
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.830
If you'll avouch 'twaswisdom Paris went--

187
00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:08.600
As you must needs, for youall cried 'Go, go,'--

188
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.430
If you'll confess hebrought home worthy prize--

189
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.670
As you must needs, for youall clapp'd your hands

190
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:20.430
And cried 'Inestimable!'--whydo you now

191
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.630
The issue of your properwisdoms rate,

192
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.270
And do a deed that fortunenever did,

193
00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.830
Beggar the estimationwhich you prized

194
00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:35.370
Richer than sea and land?O, theft most base,

195
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.500
That we have stol'n whatwe do fear to keep!

196
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.900
Cry, Trojans, cry!

197
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.530
What noise? what shriek isthis?

198
00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.770
Cry, Trojans!

199
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.030
Cry, Trojans, cry! lend meten thousand eyes,

200
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.500
And I will fill them withprophetic tears.

201
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.530
Peace, sister, Peace!!

202
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.400
Virgins and boys, mid-ageand wrinkled eld,

203
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.370
Soft infancy, that nothingcanst but cry,

204
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.500
Add to my clamours! let uspay betimes

205
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.170
A moiety of that mass ofmoan to come.

206
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.200
Cry, Trojans, cry! practiseyour eyes with tears!

207
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.600
Troy must not be, norgoodly Ilion stand;

208
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.900
Our firebrand brother,Paris, burns us all.

209
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:16.070
Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helenand a woe:

210
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:23.100
Cry, cry! Troy burns, orelse let Helen go.

211
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.330
Now, youthful Troilus, donot these high strains

212
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.870
Of divination in oursister work

213
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.770
Some touches of remorse?or is your blood

214
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.730
So madly hot that nodiscourse of reason,

215
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.930
Nor fear of bad success ina bad cause,

216
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.630
Can qualify the same?

217
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.070
Why, brother Hector,

218
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.100
We may not think thejustness of each act

219
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:51.600
Such and no other thanevent doth form it,

220
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.000
Nor once deject thecourage of our minds,

221
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.730
Because Cassandra's mad:her brain-sick raptures

222
00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.430
Cannot distaste thegoodness of a quarrel

223
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.230
Which hath our severalhonours all engaged

224
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.730
To make it gracious. Formy private part,

225
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.030
I am no more touch'd thanall Priam's sons:

226
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.900
And Jove forbid thereshould be done amongst us

227
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.900
Such things as mightoffend the weakest spleen

228
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.570
To fight for and maintain!

229
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.800
Else might the worldconvince of levity

230
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.700
As well my undertakings asyour counsels:

231
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.970
But I attest the gods,your full consent

232
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.500
Gave wings to mypropension and cut off

233
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.800
All fears attending on sodire a project.

234
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.170
For what, alas, can thesemy single arms?

235
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.700
What Propugnation is inone man's valour,

236
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.370
To stand the push andenmity of those

237
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:45.830
This quarrel would excite?Yet, I protest,

238
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.670
Were I alone to pass thedifficulties

239
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:53.630
And had as ample power asI have will,

240
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.630
Paris should ne'er retractwhat he hath done,

241
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.000
Nor faint in the pursuit.

242
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.300
Paris, you speakLike one besotted

243
00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.900
on your sweet delights:

244
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.130
You have the honey still,but these the gall;

245
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.570
So to be valiant is nopraise at all.

246
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:16.730
Sir, I propose not merelyto myself

247
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.830
The pleasures such abeauty brings with it;

248
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.270
But I would have the soilof her fair rape

249
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.900
Wiped off, in honourablekeeping her.

250
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.030
What treason were it tothe ransack'd queen,

251
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.670
Disgrace to your greatworths and shame to me,

252
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.130
Now to deliver herpossession up

253
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.430
On terms of base compulsion!

254
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.670
Can it be That so degeneratea strain as this

255
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:42.430
Should once set footing inyour generous bosoms?

256
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.870
There's not the meanestspirit on our party

257
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.270
Without a heart to dare orsword to draw

258
00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:50.800
When Helen is defended,nor none so noble

259
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.900
Whose life were illbestow'd or death unfamed

260
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.700
Where Helen is thesubject; then, I say,

261
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:03.100
Well may we fight for herwhom, we know well,

262
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:08.830
The world's large spacescannot parallel.

263
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.000
Paris and Troilus, youhave both said well,

264
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.030
And on the cause andquestion now in hand

265
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.200
Have glozed, but superficially:

266
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.270
not much Unlike young men,whom Aristotle thought

267
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.430
Unfit to hear moralphilosophy:

268
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.470
The reasons you allege domore conduce

269
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.730
To the hot passion ofdistemper'd blood

270
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.070
Than to make up a freedetermination

271
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:33.770
'Twixt right and wrong,for pleasure and revenge

272
00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.130
Have ears more deaf thanadders to the voice

273
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:40.970
Of any true decision.Nature craves

274
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:48.230
All dues be render'd totheir owners: now,

275
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:49.470
What nearer debt in allhumanity

276
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:53.100
Than wife is to thehusband? If this law

277
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.670
Of nature be corruptedthrough affection,

278
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.500
And that great minds, ofpartial indulgence

279
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.570
To their benumbed wills,resist the same,

280
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.830
There is a law in eachwell-order'd nation

281
00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.700
To curb those ragingappetites which are

282
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.770
Most disobedient andrefractory.

283
00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.800
If Helen then be wife toSparta's king,

284
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.430
As it is known she is,these moral laws

285
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.500
Of nature and of nationsspeak aloud

286
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.800
To have her back return'd:thus to persist

287
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.530
In doing wrong extenuatesnot wrong,

288
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.500
But makes it much more heavy.

289
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:33.100
Hector's opinion Isthis in way of truth;

290
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:45.070
yet ne'ertheless, My spritelybrethren, I propend to you

291
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:50.330
In resolution to keepHelen still,

292
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.730
For 'tis a cause that hathno mean dependance

293
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.030
Upon our joint and severaldignities.

294
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:58.200
Why, there you touch'd thelife of our design:

295
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.200
Were it not glory that wemore affected

296
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.700
Than the performance ofour heaving spleens,

297
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.130
I would not wish a drop ofTrojan blood

298
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:08.830
Spent more in her defence.But, worthy Hector,

299
00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:12.530
She is a theme of honourand renown,

300
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.200
A spur to valiant andmagnanimous deeds,

301
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.230
Whose present courage maybeat down our foes,

302
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.900
And fame in time to comecanonize us;

303
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.830
For, I presume, braveHector would not lose

304
00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.030
So rich advantage of apromised glory

305
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.670
As smiles upon theforehead of this action

306
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.170
For the wide world'srevenue.

307
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:30.070
I am yours,

308
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.500
You valiant offspring ofgreat Priamus.

309
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.830
I have a roistingchallenge sent amongst

310
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.300
The dun and factiousnobles of the Greeks

311
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.430
Will strike amazement totheir drowsy spirits:

312
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:44.530
I was advertised theirgreat general slept,

313
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:48.130
Whilst emulation in thearmy crept:

314
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.900
This, I presume, will wakehim.

315
00:15:55.930 --> 00:16:02.970
How now, Thersites! what lostin the labyrinth of thy fury!

316
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.200
Shall the elephantAjax carry it thus?

317
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:11.300
He beats me, and I rail athim: O, worthy satisfaction!

318
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.100
would it were otherwise;that I could beat him,

319
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.270
whilst he railed at me.'Sfoot, I'll learn to conjure

320
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.000
and raise devils, butI'll see some issue

321
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.330
of my spiteful execrations.Then there's Achilles,

322
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.670
a rare enginer! IfTroy be not taken

323
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.470
till these two undermine it,

324
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.330
the walls will stand tillthey fall of themselves.

325
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:38.000
O thou great thunder-darterof Olympus,

326
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.370
forget that thou art Jove, theking of gods and, Mercury,

327
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.330
lose all the serpentinecraft of thy caduceus,

328
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.030
if ye take not that little,little less than little wit

329
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.270
from them that they have!

330
00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.070
which short-armedignorance itself

331
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.130
knows is so abundant scarce,

332
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.500
it will not in circumventiondeliver a fly from a spider,

333
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.300
without drawingtheir massy irons

334
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.100
and cutting the web.

335
00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.830
After this, the vengeanceon the whole camp!

336
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.570
or rather, theneopolitan bone-ache!

337
00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:08.200
for that, methinks, isthe curse dependent

338
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.730
on those that warfor a placket.

339
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:15.630
I have said my prayersand devil Envy say Amen.

340
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.200
What ho! my Lord Achilles!

341
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.130
Who's there? Thersites! GoodThersites, come in and rail.

342
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:22.730
If I could have remembereda gilt counterfeit,

343
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.970
thou wouldst not have slippedout of my contemplation:

344
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.330
but it is no matter;thyself upon thyself!

345
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.130
The common curse of mankind,folly and ignorance,

346
00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.500
be thine in great revenue!

347
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.170
Let thy blood be thydirection till thy death!

348
00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.130
Where's Achilles?

349
00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.770
What, art thou devout?wast thou in prayer?

350
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.000
Ay: the heavens hear me!

351
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.070
Amen.

352
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.170
Who's there?

353
00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.530
Thersites, my lord.

354
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:50.800
Where, where? Art thou come?why, my cheese, my digestion,

355
00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.200
why hast thou not served thyselfin to my table so many meals?

356
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.130
Come, what's Agamemnon?

357
00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.330
Thy commander, Achilles.Then tell me, Patroclus,

358
00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:00.670
what's Achilles?

359
00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.470
Thy lord, Thersites: thentell me, I pray thee,

360
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:03.900
what's Thersites?

361
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.730
Thy knower, Patroclus:then tell me, Patroclus,

362
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:06.770
what art thou?

363
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.400
Thou mayst tell thatknowest.

364
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.730
O, tell, tell.

365
00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.770
I'll decline the whole question.Agamemnon commands Achilles;

366
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.700
Achilles is my lord; Iam Patroclus' knower,

367
00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.900
and Patroclus is a fool.

368
00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.770
You rascal!

369
00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:19.300
Peace, fool! I have notdone.

370
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.970
He is a privileged man.Proceed, Thersites.

371
00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.970
Agamemnon is a fool;Achilles is a fool;

372
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.970
Thersites is a fool, and, asaforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.

373
00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.400
Derive this; come.

374
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.200
Agamemnon is a fool tooffer to command Achilles;

375
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.300
Achilles is a fool to becommanded of Agamemnon;

376
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.870
Thersites is a fool toserve such a fool,

377
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.270
and Patroclus isa fool positive.

378
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.430
Why am I a fool?

379
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:44.070
Make that demand of the creater.It suffices me thou art.

380
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.900
Look you, who comes here?

381
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.200
Patroclus, I'll speak withnobody.

382
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.830
Come in with me,Thersites.

383
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:57.370
Here is such patchery, suchjuggling and such knavery!

384
00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.330
all the argument is a whore anda cuckold;

385
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.730
a good quarrel to drawemulous factions

386
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.670
and bleed to death upon.

387
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:09.200
Now, and war andlechery confound all!

388
00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.370
Where is Achilles?

389
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.930
Within his tent; but illdisposed, my lord.

390
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.800
Let it be known to himthat we are here.

391
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.830
He shent our messengers;and we lay by

392
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.230
Our appertainments,visiting of him:

393
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.170
Let him be told so; lestperchance he think

394
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.570
We dare not move thequestion of our place,

395
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.930
Or know not what we are.

396
00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.630
I shall say so to him.

397
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:37.930
We saw him at the openingof his tent:

398
00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.030
He is not sick.

399
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:44.900
Yes, lion-sick, sick ofproud heart: you may call it

400
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.000
melancholy, if you will favourthe man; but, by my head,

401
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.730
'tis pride: but why, why?let him show us the cause.

402
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:58.270
A word, my lord.

403
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.800
What moves Ajax thus tobay at him?

404
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.430
Achilles hath inveigledhis fool from him.

405
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.600
Who, Thersites?

406
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.370
He.

407
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.170
Then will Ajax lack matter,if he have lost his argument.

408
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.100
No, you see, heis his argument

409
00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.670
that has hisargument, Achilles.

410
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.970
All the better; theirfraction is more our wish

411
00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:21.370
than their faction:

412
00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:25.000
but it was a strong composurea fool could disunite.

413
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.330
The amity that wisdom knitsnot, folly may easily untie.

414
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.570
Here comes Patroclus.

415
00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.000
No Achilles with him.

416
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.030
The elephant hath joints,but none for courtesy:

417
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:40.900
his legs are legs fornecessity, not for flexure.

418
00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.270
Achilles bids me say, heis much sorry,

419
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.400
If any thing more thanyour sport and pleasure

420
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.200
Did move your greatnessand this noble state

421
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.400
To call upon him; he hopesit is no other

422
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.370
But for your health andyour digestion sake,

423
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:55.570
And after-dinner's breath.

424
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:56.600
Hear you, Patroclus:

425
00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.700
We are too well acquaintedwith these answers:

426
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.500
But his evasion, wing'dthus swift with scorn,

427
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.570
Cannot outfly ourapprehensions.

428
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.300
Much attribute he hath,and much the reason

429
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.470
Why we ascribe it to him;yet all his virtues,

430
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.330
Not virtuously on his ownpart beheld,

431
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.830
Do in our eyes begin tolose their gloss,

432
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:22.400
Yea, like fair fruit in anunwholesome dish,

433
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.000
Are like to rot untasted.Go and tell him,

434
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.530
We come to speak with him;and you shall not sin,

435
00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.730
If you do say we think himover-proud

436
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.330
And under-honest, inself-assumption greater

437
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:34.800
Than in the note of judgment;

438
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.700
and worthier than himself

439
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.400
Here tend the savagestrangeness he puts on,

440
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.030
Disguise the holy strengthof their command,

441
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.830
And underwrite in anobserving kind

442
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.100
His humorous predominance;yea, watch

443
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.800
His pettish lunes,his ebbs, his flows,

444
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.670
as if The passage and wholecarriage of this action

445
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.230
Rode on his tide. Go tellhim this, and add,

446
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.500
That if he overhold hisprice so much,

447
00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.530
We'll none of him; but lethim, like an engine

448
00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:03.300
Not portable, lie underthis report:

449
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:07.830
'Bring action hither, thiscannot go to war:

450
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.800
A stirring dwarf we doallowance give

451
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.230
Before a sleeping giant.'Tell him so.

452
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:18.100
I shall; and bring hisanswer presently.

453
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.570
In second voice we'll notbe satisfied;

454
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:28.130
We come to speak with him.Ulysses, enter you.

455
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:34.070
What is he more thananother?

456
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.970
No more than what hethinks he is.

457
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.170
Is he so much?

458
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.730
Do you not think he thinkshimself a better man than I am?

459
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:40.730
No question.

460
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:42.670
Will you subscribe histhought, and say he is?

461
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:45.530
No, noble Ajax; you areas strong, as valiant,

462
00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:49.830
as wise, no less noble,much more gentle,

463
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.330
and altogether more tractable.

464
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:56.830
Why should a man be proud?How doth pride grow?

465
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.830
I know not what pride is.

466
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.800
Your mind is the fairer, Ajax,

467
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.770
and your virtues the clearer.

468
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.230
He that is proudeats up himself:

469
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.500
pride is his own glass, his owntrumpet, his own chronicle;

470
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:13.370
and whatever praisesitself but in the deed,

471
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:15.400
devours the deed in the praise.

472
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:22.800
I do hate a proud man, as Ihate the engendering of toads.

473
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.670
Yet he loves himself: is'tnot strange?

474
00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.830
Achilles will not to thefield to-morrow.

475
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:32.770
What's his excuse?

476
00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:33.930
He doth rely on none,

477
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.000
But carries on the streamof his dispose

478
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Without observance orrespect of any,

479
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.700
In will peculiar and inself-admission.

480
00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.270
Why will he not upon ourfair request

481
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.270
Untent his person andshare the air with us?

482
00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.330
Things small as nothing,for request's sake only,

483
00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:52.070
He makes important: possess'dhe is with greatness,

484
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.270
And speaks not to himselfbut with a pride

485
00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:56.600
That quarrels atself-breath: imagined worth

486
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.030
Holds in his blood suchswoln and hot discourse

487
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.100
That 'twixt his mental andhis active parts

488
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.070
Kingdom'd Achilles incommotion rages

489
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:07.270
And batters down himself:what should I say?

490
00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.400
He is so plaguy proud thatthe death-tokens of it

491
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.600
Cry 'No recovery.'

492
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:16.730
Let Ajax go to him.

493
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.130
Dear lord, go you andgreet him in his tent:

494
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.670
'Tis said he holds you well,and will be led

495
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:23.070
At your request a littlefrom himself.

496
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:27.870
O Agamemnon, let it not beso!

497
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.300
We'll consecrate the stepsthat Ajax makes

498
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:34.200
When they go from Achilles:shall the proud lord

499
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.430
That bastes his arrogancewith his own seam

500
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:38.200
And never suffers matterof the world

501
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.730
Enter his thoughts, savesuch as do revolve

502
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.570
And ruminate himself,shall he be worshipp'd

503
00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.230
Of that we hold an idolmore than he?

504
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.270
No, this thrice worthy andright valiant lord

505
00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:52.230
Must not so stale hispalm, nobly acquired;

506
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:54.130
Nor, by my will,assubjugate his merit,

507
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.130
As amply titled asAchilles is,

508
00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.030
By going to Achilles:

509
00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.630
That were to enlard hisfat already pride

510
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:03.970
And add more coals toCancer when he burns

511
00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:07.730
With entertaining greatHyperion.

512
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:08.730
This lord go to him!Jupiter forbid,

513
00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:12.470
And say in thunder'Achilles go to him.'

514
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:14.970
O, this is well; herubs the vein of him.

515
00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.070
And how his silencedrinks up this applause!

516
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.930
If I go to him,with my armed fist

517
00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:20.830
I'll pash him o'erthe face.

518
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:22.470
O, no, you shall not go.

519
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:24.200
An a' be proud with me,I'll pheeze his pride:

520
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.970
Let me go to him.

521
00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.200
Not for the worth thathangs upon our quarrel.

522
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.000
A paltry, insolent fellow!

523
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.200
How he describes himself!

524
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.730
Can he not be sociable?

525
00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:36.030
The raven chidesblackness.

526
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.470
I'll let his humoursblood.

527
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:39.770
He will be the physicianthat should be the patient.

528
00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:41.170
An all men were o' mymind,--

529
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:42.500
Wit would be out offashion.

530
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.030
A' should not bear it so,a' should eat swords first:

531
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.870
shall pride carry it?

532
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:48.770
An 'twould, you'ld carryhalf.

533
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:50.700
A' would have ten shares.

534
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.770
I will knead him; I'llmake him supple.

535
00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:55.830
He's not yet through warm:force him with praises:

536
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:58.630
pour in, pour in; hisambition is dry.

537
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.000
My lord, you feed too muchon this dislike.

538
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.270
Our noble general, do notdo so.

539
00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.670
You must prepare to fightwithout Achilles.

540
00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:09.530
Why, 'tis this naming ofhim does him harm.

541
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:13.000
Here is a lord--but 'tisbefore his face;

542
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.370
I will be silent.

543
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:15.500
Wherefore should you so?

544
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.570
He is not emulous, asAchilles is.

545
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.270
Know the whole world, heis as valiant.

546
00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.430
A whoreson dog, that shallpelter thus with us!

547
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.070
Would he were a Trojan!

548
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.230
What a vice were it inAjax now,--

549
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:29.530
If he were proud,--

550
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:30.700
Or covetous of praise,--

551
00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.470
Ay, or surly borne,--

552
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.700
Or strange, orself-affected!

553
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.630
Thank the heavens, lord,thou art of sweet composure;

554
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.270
Praise him that got thee,she that gave thee suck:

555
00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.870
Famed be thy tutor, andthy parts of nature

556
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.830
Thrice famed, beyond allerudition:

557
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:50.600
But he that disciplinedthy arms to fight,

558
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.330
Let Mars divide eternityin twain,

559
00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.930
And give him half: and,for thy vigour,

560
00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.370
Bull-bearing Milo hisaddition yield

561
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:04.070
To sinewy Ajax. I will notpraise thy wisdom,

562
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.170
Which, like a bourn, apale, a shore, confines

563
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:12.600
Thy spacious and dilatedparts: here's Nestor;

564
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.970
Instructed by theantiquary times,

565
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:18.470
He must, he is, he cannotbut be wise:

566
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:24.130
Put pardon, father Nestor,were your days

567
00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.070
As green as Ajax' and yourbrain so temper'd,

568
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.570
You should not have theeminence of him,

569
00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:35.470
But be as Ajax.

570
00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:38.870
Shall I call you father?

571
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.430
Ay, my good son.

572
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.400
Be ruled by him, LordAjax.

573
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.130
There is no tarrying here;the hart Achilles

574
00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:47.130
Keeps thicket. Please itour great general

575
00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:49.100
To call together all hisstate of war;

576
00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.930
Fresh kings are come toTroy: to-morrow

577
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:53.870
We must with all our mainof power stand fast:

578
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:57.970
And here's a lord,--comeknights from east to west,

579
00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:02.600
And cull their flower,Ajax shall cope the best.

580
00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.800
Go we to council. LetAchilles sleep:

581
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:10.730
Light boats sail swift, thoughgreater hulks draw deep.

582
00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.300
