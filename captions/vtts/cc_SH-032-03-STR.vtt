00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.930


2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.670
Tullus Aufidius then had madenew head?

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.770
He had, my lord,

4
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.970
and that it was which caused ourswifter composition.

5
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.070
So then the Volsces stand but asat first,

6
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.830
ready, when time shall promptthem,

7
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.300
to make road upon us again.

8
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.500
They are worn, lord consul,

9
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.000
so that we shall hardly in ourages

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.970
see their banners wave again.

11
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.530
Saw you Aufidius?

12
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.700
On safeguard he came to me

13
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.100
and did curse against theVolsces,

14
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.400
for they had so vilely yieldedthe town.

15
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.800
He's retired to Antium.

16
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.800
Spoke he of me?

17
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.800
He did, my lord.

18
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.300
How; what?

19
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.330
How often he had met you, swordto sword;

20
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.830
that of all things upon theearth,

21
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.470
he hated your person most;

22
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.870
that he would pawn all hisfortunes

23
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.230
to hopeless restitution

24
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.330
so he might be called yourvanquisher.

25
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.600
At Antium lives he?

26
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.670
At Antium.

27
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.200
I wish I had a cause to seek himthere

28
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.230
to oppose his hatred fully.

29
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.100
Welcome home.

30
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.800
Behold, these are the tribunesof the people,

31
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.930
the tongues of common mouth.

32
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.870
I do despise them for they doprank them in authority

33
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.470
against all noble sufferance.

34
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.970
Pass no further.

35
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.100
Ha, what is that?

36
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.770
It will be dangerous to go on.

37
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.900
No further.

38
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.000
What makes this change?

39
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.100
The matter?

40
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.800
Hath he not passed the noble andthe common?

41
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.370
Cominius, no.

42
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.400
Have I had children's voices?

43
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.430
Tribunes, give way; he shall tothe marketplace.

44
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.970
The people are incensed againsthim.

45
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.400
Stop or all will fall in broil.

46
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.600
Are these your herd?

47
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.530
Must these have voices that canyield them now

48
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.570
and straight disclaim theirtongues?

49
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.470
What are your offices?

50
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.930
You being their mouths, why ruleyou not their teeth?

51
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.700
Have you not set them on?

52
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.470
Be calm; be calm.

53
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.100
It is a purposed thing and growsby plot

54
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.200
to curb the will of thenobility.

55
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.330
Suffer it and live with such ascannot rule

56
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.730
nor ever will be ruled.

57
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.570
Call it not a plot.

58
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.330
The people cry you mocked them,

59
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.730
and of late, when corn was giventhem gratis,

60
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.130
you repined,

61
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.830
scandaled the suppliants for thepeople,

62
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.900
called them time-pleasers,flatterers, foes to nobleness.

63
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.970
Why, this was known before.

64
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:26.970
Not to them all.

65
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.270
Have you informed them sithence?

66
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.270
How I inform them?

67
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.330
You are like to do suchbusiness.

68
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.370
Not unlike, each way, to betteryours.

69
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.100
Why then should I be consul?

70
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.430
By yond clouds, let me deserveso ill as you

71
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.570
and make me your fellow tribune.

72
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.570
You show too much of that forwhich the people stir.

73
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.100
If you will pass to where youare bound,

74
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.770
you must inquire your way,

75
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.200
which you are out of, with agentler spirit,

76
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.700
or never be so noble as aconsul,

77
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.670
nor yoke with him for tribune.

78
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.070
Let's be calm.

79
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.930
The people are abused, set on.

80
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.000
This paltering becomes not Rome,

81
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.970
nor hath Coriolanus deservedthis so dishonored rub

82
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.170
laid falsely in the plain way ofhis merit.

83
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.800
Tell me of corn.

84
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.570
This was my speech, and I willspeak it againó

85
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.970
Not now; not now.

86
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.770
Not in this heat, sir, now.

87
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.100
Now, as I live, I will.

88
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.730
My nobler friends, I crave theirpardon.

89
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.830
For the mutable, rank-scentedmany,

90
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.100
let them regard me as I do notflatter

91
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.200
and therein behold themselves.

92
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.570
I say, again, in soothing them,

93
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.900
we nourish against our senatethe cockle of rebellion,

94
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.430
insolence, sedition,

95
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.030
which we ourselves have ploughedfor, sowed, and scattered,

96
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.770
by mingling them with us, thehonored number,

97
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.700
who lack not virtue, no, norpower,

98
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.700
but that which they have givento beggars.

99
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.700
Well, no more.

100
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.100
No more words, we beseech you.

101
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.070
How no more?

102
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.630
As for my country, I have shedmy blood,

103
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.930
not fearing outward force,

104
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.230
so shall my lungs coin words

105
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.770
till their decay against thosemeasles,

106
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.800
which we disdain, should tatterus,

107
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.500
yet sought the very way to catchthem.

108
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.370
You speak of the people as ifyou were a god to punish,

109
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.170
not a man of their infirmity.

110
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.800
'Twere well we let the peopleknow it.

111
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.630
What; what?

112
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.700
His choler?

113
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.700
Choler.

114
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.270
Were I as patient as themidnight sleep,

115
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.600
by Jove, 'twould be my mind.

116
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.730
It is a mind that shall remain apoison where it is,

117
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.470
not poison any further.

118
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.200
Shall remain?

119
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.400
Hear you this, Triton of theminnows.

120
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.070
Mark you his absolute "shall"?

121
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.200
'Twas from the canon.

122
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.030
"Shall"?

123
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.470
O, good but most unwisepatricians.

124
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.030
Why, you grave but recklesssenators,

125
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.230
have you thus given Hydra hereto choose an officer,

126
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.830
that with his peremptory"shall,"

127
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.670
being but the horn and noise ofthe monster's,

128
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.400
wants not spirit to say

129
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.500
he'll turn your current in aditch

130
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.630
and make your channel his?

131
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.670
If he have power, then vail yourignorance;

132
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.900
if none, awake your dangerouslenity.

133
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.500
You are plebeians if they besenators,

134
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.770
and they are no less when, bothyour voices blended,

135
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.300
the greatest taste most palatestheirs.

136
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.570
They choose their magistrate,

137
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.770
and such a one as he who putshis "shall,"

138
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.830
his popular "shall,"

139
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.930
against a graver bench than everfrowned in Greece.

140
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.370
By Jove himself, it makes theconsuls base.

141
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.570
And my soul aches to know

142
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.600
when two authorities are up,neither supreme,

143
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.570
how soon confusion may enter'twixt the gap of both

144
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.070
and take the one by the other.

145
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.000
Well, on to the marketplace.

146
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.330
Whoever gave that counsel,

147
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.430
to give forth the corn of thestorehouse gratis,

148
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.170
as 'twas used sometime inGreeceó

149
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.500
Well, well, no more of that.

150
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.800
Though there the people had moreabsolute power, I say,

151
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.170
they nourished disobedience andfed the ruin of the state.

152
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.770
Why shall the people give onethat speaks thus their voice?

153
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.830
I'll give my reasons, moreworthier than their voices.

154
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.400
They know the corn was not ourrecompense,

155
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.200
resting well assured they ne'erdid service for it.

156
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.400
Being pressed to the war,

157
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.570
even when the navel of the statewas touched,

158
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.200
they would not thread the gate.

159
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.000
This kind of service did notdeserve corn gratis.

160
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.670
Being in the war, their mutiniesand revolts,

161
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.030
wherein they showed most valor,spoke not for them.

162
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.670
Well, what then?

163
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.500
How shall this bosom multiplieddigest the senate's courtesy?

164
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.070
Let deeds express what's like tobe their words.

165
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.100
"We did request it.

166
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.600
"We are the greater poll, and intrue fear,

167
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.270
they gave us our demand."

168
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.600
Thus we debase the nature of ourseat

169
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.170
and make the rabble call ourcares fears,

170
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.070
which will in time break ope'the locks of the senate

171
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.670
and bring in the crows to peckthe eagles.

172
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.870
Come, enough.

173
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.370
Enough with over-measure.

174
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.370
No, take more.

175
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.070
What may be sworn by both divineand human

176
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.470
seal what I end withal.

177
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.130
This double worship,

178
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.200
where one part does disdain withcause,

179
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.600
the other insult without allreason,

180
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.200
where gentry, title, wisdom,

181
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.230
cannot conclude

182
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.570
but by the yea and no of generalignorance.

183
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.300
It must omit real necessities

184
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.500
and give way the while tounstable slightness.

185
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.900
Purpose so barred, it follows,nothing is done to purpose.

186
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.000
Therefore, beseech you,

187
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.570
you that will be less fearfulthan discreet,

188
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.730
that love the fundamental partof state

189
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.430
more than you doubt the changeon it,

190
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.030
that prefer a noble life beforea long,

191
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.130
that wish to jump a body with adangerous physic

192
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.670
that's sure of death without it,

193
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.230
at once pluck out themultitudinous tongue.

194
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.900
Let them not lick the sweetwhich is their poison.

195
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.000
Your dishonor mangles truejudgment

196
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.170
and bereaves the state of thatintegrity

197
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.200
which should become it,

198
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.370
not having the power to do thegood it would,

199
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.100
for the ill which doth controlit.

200
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.330
Has said enough.

201
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.770
Hath spoken like a traitor andshall answer as traitors do.

202
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.670
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelmthee.

203
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.770
What should the people do withthese bald tribunes

204
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:12.830
on whom depending,

205
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.930
their obedience fails to thegreater bench?

206
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.770
In a rebellion, when what's notmeet,

207
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.630
but what must be was law, thenwere they chosen.

208
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.730
In a better hour,

209
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.870
let what is meet be said it mustbe meet,

210
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.730
and throw their power i' thedust.

211
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.630
Manifest treason.

212
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.770
This a consul?

213
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.000
No.

214
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.170
Aediles, ho.

215
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.330
Go, call the people,

216
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.830
in whose name myself attach theeas a traitorous innovator,

217
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.230
a foe to the public weal.

218
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.700
Obey, I charge thee, and followto thine answer.

219
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.770
Hence, old goat.

220
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:46.970
Hence, rotten thing,

221
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.070
or I'll shake thy bones out ofthy garments.

222
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.500
Help, ye citizens!

223
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.870
Here's he that would take fromyou all your power.

224
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.230
Seize him, aediles.

225
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.800
Down with him!

226
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.130
Hear me.

227
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.530
Hear me, people; peace.

228
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.130
You are at point to lose yourliberties.

229
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.200
Marcius would have all from you,

230
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.000
Marcius, whom late you havenamed for consul.

231
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.130
Fie, fie, fie.

232
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.170
This is the way to kindle not toquench.

233
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.530
To unbuild the city and to layall flat.

234
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.970
What is the city but the people?

235
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.070
True, the people are the city.

236
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.570
By the consent of all,

237
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.900
we were established the people'smagistrates.

238
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.900
You so remain.

239
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.570
And so are like to do.

240
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.200
That is the way to lay the cityflat,

241
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.230
to bring the roof to thefoundation and bury all,

242
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.770
which yet distinctly ranges inheaps and piles of ruin.

243
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.170
This deserves death.

244
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.300
Or let us stand to ourauthority,

245
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.230
or let us lose it.

246
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.170
We do here pronounce, upon thepart of the people,

247
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.800
in whose power we were electedtheirs,

248
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.570
Marcius is worthy of presentdeath.

249
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.430
Therefore lay hold of him,

250
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.970
bear him to the rock Tarpeian,

251
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.830
and from thence into destructioncast him!

252
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.770
Aediles, seize him.

253
00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.930
Beseech you, tribunes!

254
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.700
Hear me but a word.

255
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.600
Be that you seem truly yourcountry's friend,

256
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.200
and temperately proceed

257
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.600
in what you would thus violentlyredress.

258
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.770
Sir, those cold ways that seemlike prudent helps

259
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.530
are very poisonous where thedisease is violent.

260
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.730
Lay hands upon him and bear himto the rock.

261
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:26.030
No.

262
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.500
I'll die here.

263
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:35.370
There's some among you havebeheld me fighting.

264
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.870
Come;

265
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:42.400
try upon yourselves what youhave seen me.

266
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.500
Down with that sword.

267
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.500
Tribunes, withdraw awhile.

268
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.970
Go, get you to your house; begone.

269
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.600
Come, sir, along with us.

270
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.330
I would they were barbarians asthey are,

271
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.900
though in Rome littered notRomans as they are not,

272
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.670
though calved in the porch ofthe Capitol

273
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.900
Be gone.

274
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.700
Put not your worthy rage intoyour tongue.

275
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.900
One time will owe another.

276
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.400
On fair ground, I could beat 40of them.

277
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.430
Please, you, be gone.

278
00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.430
I'll try whether my old wit bein request

279
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.200
with those that have but little.

280
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:56.030
This must be patched with clothof any color.

281
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.430
Nay, come away.

282
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.400
This man has marred his fortune.

283
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.900
Where is this viper that woulddepopulate the city

284
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.670
and be every man himself?

285
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.070
You worthy tribunesó

286
00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.870
He shall be thrown down theTarpeian rock

287
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.000
with rigorous hands.

288
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.170
He hath resisted law,

289
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.500
and therefore law shall scornhim further trial

290
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.670
than the severity of the publicpower

291
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.500
which he so sets at nought.

292
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.070
Sir, sir, do not cry havoc

293
00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.470
where you should but hunt withmodest warrant.

294
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:42.500
Sir, how comes it that you haveholp to make this rescue?

295
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.930
Hear me speak.

296
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.770
As I do know the consul'sworthiness,

297
00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.070
so can I name his faultsó

298
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.600
Consul; what consul?

299
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.430
The consul Coriolanus.

300
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.600
He consul?

301
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.600
If, by the tribunes' leave, andyours, good people,

302
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.570
I may be heard, I would crave aword or two,

303
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.230
the which shall turn you to nofurther harm

304
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.330
than so much loss of time.

305
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.370
Speak briefly then,

306
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.470
for we are peremptory todispatch

307
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.100
this viperous traitor.

308
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.070
To eject him hence were but ourdanger

309
00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.670
and to keep him here our certaindeath.

310
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.370
Therefore, it is decreed, hedies tonight.

311
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.500
Now the good gods forbid thatour renowned Rome,

312
00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.430
whose gratitude towards herdeserved children

313
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.500
is enrolled in Jove's own book,

314
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.970
like an unnatural dam should noweat up her own.

315
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.430
He's a disease that must be cutaway.

316
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.700
O, he's a limb that has but adisease.

317
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.430
This is clean kam.

318
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.170
We'll hear no more.

319
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.230
Pursue him to his house andpluck him thence

320
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.670
lest his infection, being ofcatching nature,

321
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.270
spread further.

322
00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.700
One word more.

323
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.300
One word.

324
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.730
This tiger-footed rage,

325
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.600
when it shall find the harm ofunscanned swiftness,

326
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.000
will too late tie leaden poundsto his heels.

327
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.470
Proceed by process.

328
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.870
Lest parties, as he is beloved,break out

329
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.170
and sack great Rome with Romans.

330
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.370
If it were so

331
00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.570
What do ye talk?

332
00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:00.870
Have we not had a taste of hisobedience?

333
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.400
Our aediles smote?

334
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.530
Ourselves resisted?

335
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:04.530
Come.

336
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:05.930
Consider this.

337
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.200
He has been bred in the warssince he could draw a sword

338
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.930
and is ill schooled in boltedlanguage.

339
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.470
Meal and bran together he throwswithout distinction.

340
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.930
Give me leave.

341
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.530
I'll go to him

342
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.300
and undertake to bring him wherehe shall answer,

343
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:24.000
by a lawful form, in peace, tohis utmost peril.

344
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.500
Noble tribunes, it is the humaneway.

345
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.500
The other course will prove toobloody

346
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.770
and the end of it unknown to thebeginning.

347
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:37.600
Noble Menenius, be you then asthe people's officer.

348
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.070
Masters, lay down your weapons.

349
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.830
Go not home.

350
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.570
Meet on the marketplace.

351
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.500
We'll attend you there

352
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.900
where if you bring not Marcius,

353
00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.600
we'll proceed in our first way.

354
00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.800
I'll bring him to you.

355
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.670
Let them pull all about mineears,

356
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:02.570
present me death on the wheel orat wild horses' heels,

357
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.600
or pile ten hills on theTarpeian rock

358
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.770
that the precipitation

359
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.600
might down stretch below thebeam of sight,

360
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.030
yet will I still be thus tothem.

361
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.400
Why did you wish me milder?

362
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.100
Would you have me false to mynature?

363
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.930
Rather say I play the man I am.

364
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.630
O, sir, sir, sir,

365
00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.000
I would have had you put yourpower well on

366
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.430
before you'd worn it out.

367
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:30.500
Let go.

368
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.900
You might have been enough theman you are

369
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.030
with striving less to be so.

370
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.300
Lesser had been the thwartingsof your dispositions

371
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.670
if you'd not showed them how youwere disposed

372
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.430
ere they lacked power to crossyou.

373
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.370
Let them hang.

374
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.100
Ay, and burn too.

375
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.630
Come, come, you have been toorough, something too rough.

376
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.570
You must return and mend it.

377
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.530
There's no remedy, unless, bynot so doing,

378
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.570
our good city cleave in themidst and perish.

379
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.370
O, pray, be counseled.

380
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.230
I have a heart as little apt asyours

381
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.300
but yet a brain

382
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.970
that leads my use of anger tobetter vantage.

383
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.000
Well said, noble woman.

384
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.770
Before he should thus stoop tothe herd

385
00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:06.570
but that the violent fit of thetime

386
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.470
craves it as physic for thewhole state,

387
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:13.230
I would put mine armor on, whichI can scarcely bear.

388
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.800
What must I do?

389
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.100
Return to the tribunes.

390
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.400
Well, what then; what then?

391
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.700
Repent what you have spoke.

392
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.830
For them?

393
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.900
I cannot do it to the gods; mustI then do it to them?

394
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.770
You are too absolute;

395
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.530
though therein you can never betoo noble

396
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:31.000
but when extremities speak.

397
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.770
I have heard you say honor andpolicy,

398
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.070
like unsevered friends,

399
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.770
in the war do grow together.

400
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:38.770
Grant that, and tell me in peace

401
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:40.530
what each of them by the otherlose

402
00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.070
that they combine not there.

403
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:43.070
Tush, tush.

404
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.370
A good demand.

405
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.530
If it be honor in your wars toseem the same you are not,

406
00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.870
which, for your best ends, youadopt your policy,

407
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.270
how is it less or worse that itshould hold

408
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:57.400
companionship in peace withhonor, as in war,

409
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.970
since that to both it stands inlike request?

410
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.730
Why force you this?

411
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:06.130
Because that now it lies you onto speak to the people,

412
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.200
not by your own instruction,

413
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.070
nor by the matter which yourheart prompts you,

414
00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:14.730
but with such words that are butrooted in your tongue,

415
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.500
though but bastards andsyllables of no allowance

416
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.270
to your bosom's truth.

417
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.670
Now, this no more dishonors youat all

418
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.230
than to take in a town withgentle words

419
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:28.100
which else would put you to yourfortune

420
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.130
and the hazard of much blood.

421
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.370
I would dissemble with my naturewhere my fortunes

422
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:38.170
and my friends at stake requiredI should do so in honor.

423
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:39.700
I am in this your wife,

424
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.270
your son, these senators, thenobles.

425
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.170
And you will rather show ourgeneral louts

426
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.030
how you can frown than spend afawn upon them

427
00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.570
for the inheritance of theirloves

428
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.570
and safeguard of what that wantmight ruin.

429
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.330
Noble lady.

430
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.130
Come, go with us; speak fair.

431
00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.370
You may salve so not what isdangerous present,

432
00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:01.700
but the loss of what is past.

433
00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.400
I prithee now, my son,

434
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.300
go to them with thy bonnet inthy hand,

435
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.830
and thus far having stretchedit,

436
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.700
here be with them.

437
00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.530
This but done, even as shespeaks,

438
00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:13.770
why, their hearts were yours.

439
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.900
Here is Cominius.

440
00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.370
I have been in the marketplace,

441
00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.430
and, sir, 'tis fit you makestrong party

442
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.700
or defend yourself by calmnessor by absence.

443
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.970
All's in anger.

444
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.000
Only fair speech.

445
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.070
I think 'twill serve,

446
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.530
if he can thereto frame hisspirit.

447
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.200
He must and will.

448
00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.400
Prithee now; say you will and goabout it.

449
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.070
Must I go show them my unbarbedsconce?

450
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.530
Must I, with my base tongue,give to my noble heart

451
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.030
a lie that it must bear?

452
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.500
Well, I will do it.

453
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.070
But were there but this singleplot to lose,

454
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.570
this mold of Marcius,

455
00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:01.170
they to dust should grind it andthrow it against the wind.

456
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.900
To the marketplace.

457
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.330
You have put me now to such apart

458
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.730
that never shall I discharge tothe life.

459
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.430
Come, come; we'll prompt you.

460
00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.700
I prithee now, my son, as thouhast said,

461
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.330
my praises made thee first asoldier,

462
00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.870
so to have my praise for this,

463
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.800
perform a part thou hast notdone before.

464
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.430
Well, I must do it.

465
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.400
Away, my disposition.

466
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.800
Possess me some harlot's spirit.

467
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.400
My throat of war be turned,

468
00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:42.470
which, quired with my drum, intoa pipe small as an eunuch

469
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:47.000
or the virgin voice that babieslull asleep.

470
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.630
The smiles of knaves tent in mycheeks,

471
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.730
and schoolboys' tears take upthe glasses of my sight.

472
00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:56.000
I will not do it,

473
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.900
lest I surcease to honor mineown truth

474
00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.400
and by my body's action

475
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.670
teach my mind a most inherentbaseness.

476
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:05.900
At thy choice then.

477
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.000
To beg of thee,

478
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.200
it is my more disgrace than thouof them.

479
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.300
Come all to ruin.

480
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.030
Let thy mother rather feel thypride

481
00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.600
than fear thy dangerousstoutness,

482
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.100
for I mock at death with as bigheart as thou.

483
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.530
Do as thou list.

484
00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:30.700
Thy valiantness was mine.

485
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.670
Thou suck'dst it from me.

486
00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:35.570
But owe thy pride thyself.

487
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.570
Pray, be content.

488
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:49.600
Mother, I am going to themarketplace.

489
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.630
Chide me no more.

490
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:55.630
I'll mountebank their loves andcog their hearts from them

491
00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:00.730
and come home beloved of all thetrades in Rome.

492
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.730
Look, I am going.

493
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.730
Commend me to my wife.

494
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:09.330
I'll return consul,

495
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.670
or never trust to what my tonguecan do

496
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.100
i' the way of flattery further.

497
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.000
Do your will.

498
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
In this point charge him home,

499
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.570
that he affects tyrannicalpower.

500
00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:23.700
If he evade us there,

501
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.370
enforce him with his envy to thepeople,

502
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.970
and that the spoil got on theAntiates

503
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.230
was ne'er distributed.

504
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:31.870
What, will he come?

505
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.470
- He's coming. - Howaccompanied?

506
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:34.570
With old Menenius

507
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.570
and those senators that alwaysfavored him.

508
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.430
Have you a catalog of all thevoices

509
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.330
that we have procured set downby the poll?

510
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:41.570
I have; 'tis ready.

511
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:43.000
Have you collected them bytribes?

512
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.200
I have.

513
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.000
Assemble presently the peoplehither,

514
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.530
and when they hear me say,

515
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.870
"It shall be so in the right andstrength of the commons,"

516
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.600
be it either for death, forfine, or banishment,

517
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.700
then let them,

518
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:59.070
if I say fine, cry "Fine," ifdeath, cry "Death,"

519
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.770
insisting on the old prerogative

520
00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.330
and power in the truth of thecause.

521
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:03.330
I shall inform them.

522
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.630
And when such time they havebegun to cry,

523
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:06.770
let them not cease,

524
00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:09.500
but with a din confused enforcethe present execution

525
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.430
of what we chance to sentence.

526
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.430
Very well.

527
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:14.100
Make them be strong and readyfor this hint

528
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.530
when we shall hap to give itthem.

529
00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:16.600
Go about it.

530
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:20.330
Put him to choler straight.

531
00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.930
He hath been used ever toconquer

532
00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.400
and to have his worth ofcontradiction.

533
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.000
Being once chafed,

534
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.500
he cannot be reined again totemperance.

535
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.230
Then he speaks what's in hisheart,

536
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:34.400
and that is there which lookswith us to break his neck.

537
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.070
Well, here he comes.

538
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.570
Calmly, I do beseech you.

539
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.330
Ay, as an ostler, that for thepoorest piece

540
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:45.870
will bear the knave by thevolume.

541
00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.400
The honored gods keep Rome insafety,

542
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:04.700
her chairs of justice suppliedwith worthy men,

543
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:09.030
plant love among us,

544
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.600
and throng our large templeswith the shows of peace

545
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.100
and not our streets with war.

546
00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.430
Amen, amen.

547
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.200
A noble wish.

548
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.570
Shall I be charged no furtherthan this present?

549
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.630
Must all determine here?

550
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.500
I do demand,

551
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.970
if you submit you to thepeople's voices,

552
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:34.330
allow their officers,

553
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:37.100
and are content to suffer lawfulcensure

554
00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:43.130
for such faults as shall beproved upon you?

555
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.130
I...

556
00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:49.770
am content.

557
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.730
Lo, citizens, he says he iscontent.

558
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:55.470
The warlike service he has done,consider.

559
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.630
Think upon the wounds his bodybears,

560
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.670
which show like graves in theholy churchyard.

561
00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:00.870
Scratches with briers;

562
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.430
scars to move laughter only.

563
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:05.600
Consider further that when hespeaks not like a citizen,

564
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.530
you find him like a soldier.

565
00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:11.300
Do not take his rougher accentsfor malicious sounds,

566
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.430
but, as I say,

567
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.130
such as become a soldier ratherthan envy you.

568
00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:16.270
What is the matter

569
00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:18.830
that being passed for consulwith full voice,

570
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.200
I am so dishonored

571
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.130
that the very hour you take itoff again?

572
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.700
Answer to us.

573
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.170
Say, then.

574
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.230
'Tis true.

575
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.770
I ought so.

576
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:36.230
We charge you that you

577
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:39.370
have contrived to take from Romeall seasoned office

578
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.400
and to wind yourself into apower tyrannical,

579
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.600
for which you are a traitor tothe people.

580
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.130
How, traitor?

581
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:48.570
Nay, temperately; your promise.

582
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.270
The fires i' the lowest hellfold in the people.

583
00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:54.530
Call me their traitor.

584
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.500
Thou injurious tribune.

585
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.270
Within thine eyes sat 20,000deaths,

586
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.030
in thy hands clutched as manymillions,

587
00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.300
in thy lying tongue bothnumbers.

588
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.300
I would say, "Thou liest," untothee

589
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.870
with a voice as free as I dopray the gods.

590
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.200
Mark you this, people?

591
00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.830
We need not put new matter tohis charge.

592
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:14.800
What you have seen him do andheard him speak,

593
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.030
beating your officers, cursingyourselves,

594
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.470
opposing laws with strokes

595
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:21.970
and here defying those whosegreat power must try him;

596
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:25.930
even this, so criminal and insuch capital kind,

597
00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:28.630
deserves the extremest death.

598
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.970
But since he hath served wellfor Romeó

599
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.600
What do you prate of service?

600
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.730
I talk of that that know it.

601
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:35.770
You?

602
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.530
Is this the promise that youmade your mother?

603
00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:39.200
- Know, I pray you - I'll knowno further.

604
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.070
Let them pronounce the steepTarpeian death,

605
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:43.170
vagabond exile, flaying,

606
00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:45.130
pent to linger but with a graina day.

607
00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:48.500
I would not buy their mercy atthe price of one fair word.

608
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.670
For that he has, as much as inhim lies,

609
00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:53.670
from time to time envied againstthe people,

610
00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:56.500
seeking means to pluck awaytheir power,

611
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.730
as now at last given hostilestrokes,

612
00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:02.000
and that not in the presence ofdreaded justice,

613
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.300
but on the ministers that dodistribute it,

614
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.070
in the name of the people

615
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.000
and in the power of us, thetribunes,

616
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.170
we, even from this instant,banish him our city,

617
00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.870
in peril of precipitation fromoff the rock Tarpeian

618
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:21.470
never more to enter our Romegates.

619
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:26.300
In the people's name, I say itshall be so.

620
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.070
Hear me, my masters and mycommon friends

621
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.530
He's sentenced; no more hearing.

622
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:30.530
Let me speak.

623
00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:31.630
I have been consul

624
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.430
and can show for Rome herenemies' marks upon me.

625
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:36.770
I do love my country's good witha respect more tender,

626
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.770
more holy and profound than mineown life,

627
00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:42.170
my dear wife's estimate, herwomb's increase,

628
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:45.270
and treasure of my loins; thenif I would speak tható

629
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.030
We know your drift; speak what?

630
00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.370
There's no more to be said,

631
00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:52.470
but he is banished as enemy tothe people and his country.

632
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.300
It shall be so.

633
00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.330
It shall be so; it shall be so.

634
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:04.530
You common cry of curs

635
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:09.030
whose breath I hate as reek ofthe rotten fens,

636
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.670
whose loves I prize

637
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.970
as the dead carcasses ofunburied men

638
00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.900
that do corrupt my air,

639
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:19.870
I banish you

640
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:23.030
and here remain with youruncertainty.

641
00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:26.270
Let every feeble rumor shakeyour hearts.

642
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.730
Your enemies, with nodding oftheir plumes,

643
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:32.270
fan you into despair.

644
00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.270
Have the power still to banishyour defenders

645
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:39.530
till at length your ignorance,which finds not till it feels,

646
00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.270
deliver you as most abatedcaptives to some nation

647
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:45.770
that won you without blows.

648
00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:50.270
Despising for you, the city,

649
00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:54.130
thus I turn my back.

650
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:12.870
There is a world elsewhere.

651
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:17.700
Come, leave your tears.

652
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.700
A brief farewell.

653
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.470
The beast with many heads buttsme away.

654
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:30.100
Nay, mother, where is yourancient courage?

655
00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:34.100
You were used to say extremitieswas the trier of spirits;

656
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.130
that common chances common mencould bear;

657
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.100
that when the sea was calm,

658
00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:43.070
all boats alike showedmastership in floating.

659
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:45.400
You were used to load me withprecepts

660
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.170
that would make invincible theheart that conned them.

661
00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:50.670
O, heavens; O, heavens.

662
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:51.870
Nay, good woman

663
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:55.000
Now the red pestilence strikeall trades in Rome

664
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.570
and occupations perish.

665
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.330
What, what, what?

666
00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:05.200
I shall be loved when I amlacked.

667
00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:08.500
Nay, good mother.

668
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.870
Resume that spirit when you werewont to say

669
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.630
if you had been the wife ofHercules,

670
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.330
six of his labors you'd havedone

671
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:17.130
and saved your husband so muchsweat.

672
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.370
Thy tears are salter than ayounger man's

673
00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:25.230
and venomous to thine eyes.

674
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.430
My sometime general, I have seenthee stern

675
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:34.100
and thou hast oft beheldheart-hardening spectacles.

676
00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.130
Tell these sad women

677
00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.130
'tis fond to wail inevitablestrokes

678
00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:43.070
as 'tis to laugh at them.

679
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.300
My mother,

680
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:50.370
you wot well my hazards stillhave been your solace.

681
00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:54.570
and believed, not lightly,though I go alone,

682
00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:57.470
like to a lonely dragon,

683
00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:00.830
that his fen makes feared andtalked of more than seen.

684
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.870
Your son will or exceed thecommon

685
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:09.230
or be caught with cautelousbaits and practice.

686
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:12.530
My first son.

687
00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:16.530
Whither wilt thou go?

688
00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:18.970
Take good Cominius with theeawhile.

689
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:20.300
Determine on some course

690
00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.400
more than a wild exposture toeach chance

691
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.630
that starts in the way beforethee.

692
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.730
O, the gods.

693
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:28.770
I'll follow thee a month,

694
00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:30.330
devise with thee where thoushalt rest,

695
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.430
that thou shalt hear of us andwe of thee,

696
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.770
so if the time thrust forth acause for thy repeal,

697
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.370
we shall not send over the vastworld

698
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.270
to seek a single man and loseadvantage,

699
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.500
which doth ever cool in theabsence of the needer.

700
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.670
O, fare ye well.

701
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:43.670
Thou hast years upon thee.

702
00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:45.200
Thou art too full of the wars'surfeits

703
00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.100
to go rove with one that's yetunbruised.

704
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.370
Bring me but out at gate.

705
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:52.970
Come now, my sweet wife, mydearest mother,

706
00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:54.970
and my friends of nobler touch.

707
00:30:54.970 --> 00:31:01.130
When I am forth, bid me farewelland smile.

708
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:03.900
I pray you, come.

709
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.130
While I remain above the ground,you shall hear from me still

710
00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:14.200
and never of me aught but whatis like me

711
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.730
formerly.

712
00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:20.730
Pray, come.

713
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.430
