but now you are a leader.

169
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.730

O, you are a flattering boy:

Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?

177
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.500
Truly, sir, to see your wife.

Is she at home?

179
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:14.900
Ay; and as idle as she

180
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.300
may hang together, for want of company.

181
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.570
I think, if your husbands were dead,

182
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.130
you two would marry.

183
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.870
Be sure of that,--two other husbands.

184
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.530
Where had you this pretty weather-cock?

185
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.730
I cannot tell

186
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.130

187
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.500

188
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.970
What do you call your knight's name, sirrah?

189
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.530
Sir John Falstaff.

190
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:38.200
Sir John Falstaff!

191
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.000
He, he; I can never hit on's name.

192
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.430
There is such a league

193
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:43.870
between my good man and he!

194
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.170
Is your wife at home indeed?

195
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.400
Indeed she is.

196
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.900
By your leave, sir:

197
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.900
I am sick till I see her.

198
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.430
Has Page any brains?

199
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.730
hath he any eyes?

200
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.000
hath he any thinking?

201
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.930
Sure, they sleep;

202
00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.530
he hath no use of them.

203
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:02.930
Why, this boy will carry

204
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.400
a letter twenty mile,

205
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.130
as easy as a cannon

206
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.300
will shoot point-blank twelve score.

207
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.570
He pieces out his wife's inclination;

208
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.430
he gives her folly motion and advantage:

209
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.200
and now she's going to my wife,

210
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.230
and Falstaff's boy with her.

211
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.300
A man may hear this shower

212
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.630
sing in the wind.

213
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.170
And Falstaff's boy with her!

214
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.330
Good plots, they are laid;

215
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.830
and our revolted wives

216
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.500
share damnation together.

217
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.670
Well; I will take him,

218
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.500
then torture my wife,

219
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.970
pluck the borrowed veil of modesty

220
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.200
from the so seeming Mistress Page,

221
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.130
divulge Page himself

222
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.600
for a secure and wilful Actaeon;

223
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.700
and to these violent proceedings

224
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.700
all my neighbours shall cry aim.

225
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.530
(Clock chimes)

226
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.600
The clock gives me my cue,

227
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.830
and my assurance bids me search:

228
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.670
there I shall find Falstaff:

229
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.130
I shall be rather praised for this than mocked;

230
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.230
for it is as positive

231
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.430
as the earth is firm

232
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.730
that Falstaff is there: I will go.

233
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.130
Well met, Master Ford.

234
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.530
Trust me, a good knot:

235
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.300
I have good cheer at home;

236
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:15.230
and I pray you all go with me.

237
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.270
I must excuse myself, Master Ford.

238
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.170
And so must I, sir:

239
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.070
we have appointed to dine

240
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.230
with Mistress Anne,

241
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.330
and I would not break with her

242
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.800
for more money than I'll speak of.

243
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.170
We have lingered about a match

244
00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:26.900
between Anne Page

245
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.330
and my cousin Slender,

246
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.230
and this day we shall have our answer.

247
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.170
I hope I have your good will, father Page.

248
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:33.470
You have, Master Slender;

249
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.300
I stand wholly for you:

250
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.670
but my wife, master doctor,

251
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.730
is for you altogether.

252
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.700
Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me:

253
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.070
my nursh-a Quickly tell me so mush.

254
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.300
What say you to young Master Fenton?

255
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.870
he capers, he dances,

256
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.530
he has eyes of youth,

257
00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:51.870
he writes verses,

258
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.500
he speaks holiday,

259
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.930
he smells April and May:

260
00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.470
he will carry't, he will carry't; '

261
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:59.670
tis in his buttons;

262
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:00.870
he will carry't.

263
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.900
Not by my consent, I promise you.

264
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.470
The gentleman is of no having:

265
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:06.770
he kept company with the wild prince

266
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:07.600
and Poins;

267
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.370
he is of too high a region;

268
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.430
he knows too much.

269
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.170
No, he shall not knit a knot

270
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.000
in his fortunes

271
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.730
with the finger of my substance:

272
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:16.600
if he take her,

273
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.170
let him take her simply;

274
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.830
the wealth I have waits on my consent,

275
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.100
and my consent goes not that way.

276
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.600
I beseech you heartily,

277
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.000
some of you go home with me to dinner:

278
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.370
besides your cheer,

279
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.030
you shall have sport;

280
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.800
I will show you a monster.

281
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.270
Master doctor, you shall go;

282
00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.270
so shall you, Master Page;

283
00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.230
and you, Sir Hugh.

284
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.500
Well, fare you well:

285
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.730
we shall have the freer wooing

286
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.670
at Master Page's.

287
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.130
Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.

288
00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.870
Farewell, my hearts:

289
00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.400
I will to my honest knight Falstaff,

290
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.370
and drink canary with him.

291
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.330
I think I shall drink in pipe wine first with him;

292
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.030
I'll make him dance.

293
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.930
Will you go, gentles?

294
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.600
Have with you to see this monster.

295
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:24.170
(music)

296
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.500
What, John! What, Robert!

297
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.430
Quickly, quickly! is the buck-basket--

298
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.500
I warrant. What, Robert, I say!

299
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:36.870
Here, set it down.

300
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.170
Come, come, come.

301
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:39.030
Give your men the charge;

302
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.070
we must be brief.

303
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:41.770
Marry,

304
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.800
as I told you before, John and Robert,

305
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.730
be ready here hard by

306
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.670
in the brew-house:

307
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:46.970
and when I suddenly call you,

308
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:47.800
come forth,

309
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.930
and without any pause or staggering

310
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.830
take this basket on your shoulders:

311
00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:53.300
that done, trudge with it

312
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.270
in all haste,

313
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.400
and carry it among the whitsters

314
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.470
in Datchet-mead,

315
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.970
and there empty it  -- in Datchet-mead --

316
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:00.530
in the muddy ditch close

317
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.330
by the Thames side.

318
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:03.330
You will do it?

319
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:04.430
I ha' told them over and over;

320
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.370
they lack no direction.

321
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.970
Be gone, and come when you are called.

322
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.800
Here comes little Robin.

323
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.270
How now, my eyas-musket!

324
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.270
what news with you?

325
00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.270
My master, Sir John,

326
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.000
is come in at your back-door, Mistress Ford,

327
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.700
and requests your company.

328
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.970
You little Jack-a-Lent,

329
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.470
have you been true to us?

330
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.170
Ay, I'll be sworn.

331
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.400
My master knows not

332
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.200
of your being here

333
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.030
and hath threatened to put me

334
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.100
into everlasting liberty

335
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.570
if I tell you of it;

336
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.230
for he swears he'll turn me away.

337
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.800
Thou'rt a good boy:

338
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.400
this secrecy of thine

339
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.030
shall be a tailor to thee

340
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.170
and shall make thee a new doublet

341
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.700
and hose. I'll go hide me.

342
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:47.130
Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone.

343
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.930
Mistress Page, remember you your cue.

344
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:56.670
I warrant thee;

345
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.300
if I do not act it, hiss me.

346
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.700
Go to, then:

347
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:07.170
we'll use this unwholesome humidity,

348
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.900
this gross watery pumpion;

349
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.470
we'll teach him to know turtles from jays.

350
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:14.900
Have I caught thee,

351
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.600
my heavenly jewel?

352
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.800
Why, now let me die,

353
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.930
for I have lived long enough:

354
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.000
this is the period of my ambition:

355
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.500
O this blessed hour!

356
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.270
O sweet Sir John!

357
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.470
Mistress Ford, I cannot cog,

358
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.530
I cannot prate, Mistress Ford.

359
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.130
Now shall I sin in my wish:

360
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.330
I would thy husband were dead:

361
00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:36.600
I'll speak it before the best lord;

362
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.270
I would make thee my lady.

363
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.130
I your lady, Sir John!

364
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.030
alas, I should be a pitiful lady!

365
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.730
Let the court of France

366
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.700
show me such another.

367
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.970
I see how thine eye

368
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.900
would emulate the diamond:

369
00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.800
thou hast the right arched beauty

370
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.330
of the brow that becomes the ship-tire,

371
00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.800
the tire-valiant, or any tire

372
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.170
of Venetian admittance.

373
00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:02.470
A plain kerchief, Sir John:

374
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:03.800
my brows become nothing else;

375
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.130
nor that well neither.

376
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:06.830
By the Lord,

377
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.500
thou art a tyrant to say so:

378
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.330
thou wouldst make an absolute courtier;

379
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.600
and the firm fixture of thy foot

380
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.830
would give an excellent motion

381
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:16.600
to thy gait

382
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.770
in a semi-circled farthingale.

383
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.130
I see what thou wert,

384
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:20.830
if Fortune,

385
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.800
not Nature were thy friend.

386
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.430
Come, thou canst not hide it.

387
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.600
Believe me, there is no such thing in me.

388
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.430
What made me love thee?

389
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.800
let that persuade thee

390
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.000
there's something extraordinary in thee.

391
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.400
Come, I cannot cog

392
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.430
and say thou art this and that,

393
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.000
like a many of these lisping hawthorn-buds,

394
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.400
that come like women in men's apparel,

395
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.200
and smell like Bucklersbury in simple time;

396
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.230
I cannot: but I love thee;

397
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:56.630
none but thee; and thou deservest it.

398
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:58.870
Do not betray me, sir.

399
00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:01.230
I fear you love Mistress Page.

400
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.030
Thou mightst as well say

401
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.600
I love to walk by the Counter-gate,

402
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.800
which is as hateful to me

403
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.370
as the reek of a lime-kiln.

404
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:15.470
Well, heaven knows how I love you;

405
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.570
and you shall one day find it.

406
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.030
Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.

407
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.100
Nay, I must tell you, so you do;

408
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.630
or else I could not be in that mind.

409
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.000
Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford!

410
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.530
here's Mistress Page at the door,

411
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.700
sweating and blowing and looking wildly,

412
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.800
and would needs speak with you presently.

413
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.670
She shall not see me:

414
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.570
I will ensconce me

415
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.500
behind the arras.

416
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.870
Pray you, do so:

417
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.270
she's a very tattling woman.

418
00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:01.430
What's the matter? how now!

419
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.300
O Mistress Ford, what have you done?

420
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.400
You're shamed, you're overthrown,

421
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.600
you're undone for ever!

422
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.770
What's the matter, good Mistress Page?

423
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.400
O well-a-day, Mistress Ford!

424
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.770
having an honest man to your husband,

425
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.900
to give him such cause of suspicion!

426
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.330
What cause of suspicion?

427
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:16.300
What cause of suspicion!

428
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.470
Out pon you! how am I mistook in you!

429
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.200
Why, alas, what's the matter?

430
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.800
Your husband's coming hither, woman,

431
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.600
with all the officers in Windsor,

432
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.200
to search for a gentleman

433
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.000
that he says is here now in the house

434
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.870
by your consent,

435
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.700
to take an ill advantage of his absence:

436
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.030
you are undone.

437
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.070
'Tis not so, I hope.

438
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:36.300
Pray heaven it be not so,

439
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.670
that you have such a man here!

440
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.670
but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,

441
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.130
with half Windsor at his heels,

442
00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.300
to search for such a one.

443
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.470
I come before to tell you.

444
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.500
If you know yourself clear,

445
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.570
why, I am glad of it;

446
00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:53.370
but if you have a friend here convey,

447
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.770
convey him out.

448
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:55.570
Be not amazed;

449
00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.230
call all your senses to you;

450
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.200
defend your reputation,

451
00:17:59.200 --> 00:17:59.930
or bid farewell

452
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.770
to your good life for ever.

453
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.770
What shall I do?

454
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.330
There is a gentleman my dear friend;

455
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.100
and I fear not mine own shame

456
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.470
so much as his peril:

457
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.430
I had rather than a thousand pound

458
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.270
he were out of the house.

459
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.100
For shame!

460
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.000
never stand 'you had rather'

461
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
and 'you had rather:'

462
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.770
your husband's here at hand,

463
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:19.830
bethink you of some conveyance:

464
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:23.300
in the house you cannot hide him.

465
00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.670
O, how have you deceived me!

466
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.900
Look, here is a basket:

467
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.630
if he be of any reasonable stature,

468
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.130
he may creep in here;

469
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.600
and throw foul linen upon him,

470
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.930
as if it were going to bucking:

471
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:37.700
or--it is whiting-time

472
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.130
--send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.

473
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.030
He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?

474
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.800
Let me see't, let me see't,

475
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.570
O, let me see't!

476
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.200
I'll in, I'll in.

477
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.470
Follow your friend's counsel. I'll in.

478
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.630
What, Sir John Falstaff!

479
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:55.730
Why, Sir John!

480
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.100
Is this your love? Are these your letters, knight?

481
00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.230
I love thee,  none but thee.

482
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:01.370
Help me away.

483
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:05.300
Let me creep in here.

484
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.870
I'll never--

485
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.830
Help to cover your master, boy.

486
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.570
Call your men, Mistress Ford.

487
00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:13.100
What, John! Robert! John!

488
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.170
You dissembling knight!

489
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.200
Go take up these clothes here quickly.

490
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.030
Where's the cowl-staff?

491
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.800
look, how you drumble!

492
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.100
Carry them to the laundress in Datchet-mead;

493
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.200
quickly, come.

494
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.630
Pray you, come near:

495
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.130
if I suspect without cause,

496
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.570
why then make sport at me;

497
00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:41.870
then let me be your jest;

498
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.000
I deserve it.

499
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.330
How now! whither bear you this?

500
00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.030
To the laundress, forsooth.

501
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.370
Why, what have you to do

502
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:53.300
whither they bear it?

503
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.370
You were best meddle with buck-washing.

504
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:56.870
Buck! I would I could wash myself

505
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:57.900
of the buck!

506
00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.530
Buck, buck, buck!

507
00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.630
Ay, buck; I warrant you, buck;

508
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.670
and of the season too, it shall appear.

509
00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.600
Gentlemen, I have dreamed to-night;

510
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.100
I'll tell you my dream.

511
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:16.430
Here, here, here be my keys:

512
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:17.670
ascend my chambers;

513
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.670
search, seek, find out:

514
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.400
I'll warrant we'll unkennel the fox.

515
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.200
Let me stop this way first.

516
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.670
So, now uncape.

517
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.170
Good Master Ford, be contented:

518
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.730
you wrong yourself too much.

519
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.670
True, Master Page.

520
00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:38.370
Up, gentlemen:

521
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.570
you shall see sport anon:

522
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.870
follow me, gentlemen.

523
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.130
This is fery fantastical humours

524
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:47.170
and jealousies.

525
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.170
By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France;

526
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:51.830
it is not jealous in France.

527
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:54.070
Nay, follow him, gentlemen;

528
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.570
see the issue of his search.

529
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.400
Is there not a double excellency in this?

530
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.030
I know not which pleases me better,

531
00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.700
that my husband is deceived, or Sir John.

532
00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.830
What a taking was he in

533
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.470
when your husband asked who was in the basket!

534
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.330
I warrent he will have need of washing;

535
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.300
so throwing him into the water

536
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.630
will do him a benefit.

537
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:24.770
Hang him, dishonest rascal!

538
00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.300
I would all of the same strain

539
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.100
were in the same distress.

540
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:54.670
I think my husband

541
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:55.770
hath some special suspicion

542
00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.530
of Falstaff's being here;

543
00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:58.870
for I never saw him so gross

544
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.900
in his jealousy till now.

545
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.700
I will lay a plot to try that;

546
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.200
and we will yet have more tricks

547
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.000
with Falstaff:

548
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:05.870
his dissolute disease

549
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.770
will scarce obey this medicine.

550
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:09.330
Shall we send that foolish carrion,

551
00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:10.770
Mistress Quickly, to him,

552
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.770
and excuse his throwing into the water;

553
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.500
and give him another hope,

554
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.830
to betray him to another punishment?

555
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.100
We will do it:

556
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.300
let him be sent for to-morrow,

557
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.170
eight o'clock, to have amends.

558
00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:26.230
I cannot find him:

559
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.130
may be the knave bragged

560
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.270
of that he could not compass.

561
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.870
Heard you that?

562
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.100
You use me well, Master Ford, do you?

563
00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.070
Ay, I do so.

564
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:39.130
Heaven make you better than your thoughts!

565
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:40.100
Amen!

566
00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.800
You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.

567
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.570
Ay, ay; I must bear it.

568
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:45.500
If there be any body in the house,

569
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.630
or in the chambers,

570
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:47.630
or in the coffers,

571
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:48.830
or in the presses,

572
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:49.770
heaven forgive my sins

573
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:50.930
at the day of judgment!

574
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:52.900
By gar, nor I too:

575
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.130
there is no bodies.

576
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:56.330
Fie, fie, Master Ford!

577
00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.130
are you not ashamed?

578
00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:59.000
What spirit,

579
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.170
what devil suggests this imagination?

580
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:02.500
I would not ha' your distemper

581
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.630
in this kind for the wealth

582
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.270
of Windsor Castle.

583
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:06.370
'Tis my fault, Master Page:

584
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:07.530
I suffer for it.

585
00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.900
You suffer for a bad conscience:

586
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.470
your wife is as honest a 'omans

587
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.570
as I will desires among five thousand,

588
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.300
and five hundred too.

589
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.770
By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.

590
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:22.930
Well, I promised you a dinner.

591
00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:24.430
Come,

592
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:35.770
come, walk in the Park:

593
00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.300
I pray you, pardon me;

594
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.570
I will hereafter make known to you

595
00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.770
why I have done this.

596
00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:47.600
Come, wife; come, Mistress Page.

597
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.170
I pray you, pardon me;

598
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.300
pray heartily, pardon me.

599
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.530
Let's go in, gentlemen;

600
00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.170
but, trust me, we'll mock him.

601
00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:00.300
I do invite you to-morrow morning

602
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.000
to my house to breakfast:

603
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.230
after, we'll a-birding together;

604
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:07.000
I have a fine hawk for the bush.

605
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.970
Shall it be so?

606
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:09.270
Any thing.

607
00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.670
If there is one, I shall make two

608
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:11.530
in the company.

609
00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:12.170
If dere be one or two,

610
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.470
I shall make-a the turd.

611
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.600
Pray you, go, Master Page.

612
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.630
I pray you now, remembrance tomorrow

613
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.530
on the lousy knave, mine host.

614
00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.270
Dat is good; by gar,

615
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.370
with all my heart!

616
00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:27.770
A lousy knave,

617
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:31.070
to have his gibes and his mockeries!

618
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.900
We'll leave a proof

619
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.830
by that which we will do

620
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:50.000
wives may be merry, and yet honest too!

621
00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:02.530
I see I cannot get thy father's love;

622
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:03.230
Therefore no more

623
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:04.570
turn me to him, sweet Nan.

624
00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.170
Alas, how then?

625
00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.900
Why, thou must be thyself.

626
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.500
He doth object

627
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.870
I am too great of birth--,

628
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.000
And that, my state being gall'd

629
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:14.930
with my expense,

630
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.670
I seek to heal it only by his wealth:

631
00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:18.500
Besides these,

632
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.130
other bars he lays before me,

633
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:23.030
My riots past, my wild societies;

634
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.030
And tells me 'tis a thing impossible

635
00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:25.570
I should love thee but as a property.

636
00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:26.700
May be he tells you true.

637
00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.270
No, heaven so speed me

638
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.230
in my time to come!

639
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:33.370
Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth

640
00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:34.300
Was the first motive

641
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.370
that I woo'd thee, Anne:

642
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:36.270
Yet, wooing thee,

643
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:37.630
I found thee of more value

644
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.070
Than stamps in gold

645
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.970
or sums in sealed bags;

646
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:42.930
And 'tis the very riches of thyself

647
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.300
That now I aim at.

648
00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.230
Gentle Master Fenton,

649
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:47.630
Yet seek my father's love;

650
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.700
still seek it, sir:

651
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.730
If opportunity and humblest suit

652
00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.230
Cannot attain it,

653
00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:58.400
why, then,--hark you hither!

654
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.430
Break their talk, Mistress Quickly:

655
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:05.200
my kinsman shall speak for himself.

656
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:05.900
I'll make a shaft

657
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.270
or a bolt on't: 'slid, '

658
00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:08.570
tis but venturing.

659
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.170
Be not dismayed.

660
00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:11.200
No, she shall not dismay me:

661
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.900
I care not for that,

662
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.270
but that I am afeard.

663
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.330
Hark ye; Master Slender

664
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.930
would speak a word with you.

665
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:19.170
I come to him.

666
00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.600
This is my father's choice.

667
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.370
O, what a world

668
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.030
of vile ill-favor'd faults

669
00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:26.430
Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a-year!

670
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:29.330
And how does good Master Fenton?

671
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.370
Pray you, a word with you.

672
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:39.230
She's coming; to her, coz.

673
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.970
O boy, thou hadst a father!

674
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:49.170
I had a father, Mistress Anne;

675
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.070
my uncle can tell you good jests of him.

676
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.200
Pray you, uncle,

677
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.000
tell Mistress Anne the jest,

678
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.900
how my father stole two geese

679
00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.700
out of a pen, good uncle.

680
00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:06.830
Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.

681
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:09.070
Ay, that I do; as well as I love

682
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:11.270
any woman in Gloucestershire.

683
00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.170
He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.

684
00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:15.400
Ay, that I will, come cut

685
00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.230
and long-tail,

686
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.000
under the degree of a squire.

687
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.200
He will make you a hundred

688
00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.930
and fifty pounds jointure.

689
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:22.900
Good Master Shallow,

690
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.000
let him woo for himself.

691
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:27.300
Marry, I thank you for it;

692
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.630
I thank you for that good comfort.

693
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:34.470
She calls you, coz: I'll leave you.

694
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.930
Now, Master Slender,--

695
00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.330
Now, good Mistress Anne,--

696
00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.530
What is your will?

697
00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.930
My will! 'od's heartlings,

698
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.070
that's a pretty jest indeed!

699
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:48.470
I ne'er made my will yet,

700
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:49.270
I thank heaven;

701
00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:50.230
I am not such a sickly creature,

702
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:51.300
I give heaven praise.

703
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.600
I mean, Master Slender,

704
00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.600
what would you with me?

705
00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:59.700
Truly, for mine own part,

706
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.330
I would little or nothing with you.

707
00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:05.430
Your father and my uncle

708
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.170
hath made motions:

709
00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:09.800
if it be my luck, so;

710
00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.800
if not, happy man be his dole!

711
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.070
They can tell you how things go better than I.

712
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:18.330
You may ask your father; here he comes.

713
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.000
Now, Master Slender:

714
00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:28.300
love him, daughter Anne.

715
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.470
Why, how now!

716
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:33.100
what does Master Fenton here?

717
00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.330
You wrong me, sir,

718
00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:35.730
thus still to haunt my house:

719
00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:37.270
I told you, sir,

720
00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.930
my daughter is disposed of.

721
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:41.600
Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.

722
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.400
Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.

723
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.670
She is no match for you.

724
00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:46.930
Sir, will you hear me?

725
00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:50.830
No, good Master Fenton.

726
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:51.670
Come, Master Shallow;

727
00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:54.370
come, son Slender, in.

728
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.100
Knowing my mind,

729
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.400
you wrong me, Master Fenton.

730
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:11.670
Speak to Mistress Page.

731
00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:15.370
Good Mistress Page,

732
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:17.730
for that I love your daughter

733
00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.370
In such a righteous fashion as I do,

734
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:21.700
Perforce, against all cheques,

735
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.130
rebukes and manners,

736
00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:26.800
I must advance the colours of my love

737
00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.570
And not retire:

738
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.670
let me have your good will.

739
00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:33.530
Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.

740
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.900
I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.

741
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.830
That's my master, master doctor.

742
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.270
Alas, I had rather be set quick

743
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.130
i' the earth

744
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:42.070
And bowl'd to death with turnips!

745
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.730
Come, trouble not yourself.

746
00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:46.930
Good Master Fenton,

747
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:50.730
I will not be your friend nor enemy:

748
00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:52.230
My daughter will I question

749
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:53.670
how she loves you,

750
00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:57.600
And as I find her, so am I affected.

751
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.970
Till then farewell, sir:

752
00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.470
she must needs go in;

753
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:03.530
Her father will be angry.

754
00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:08.470
Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.

755
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.730
This is my doing, now: '

756
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:14.970
Nay,' said I,

757
00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.000
'will you cast away your child on a fool,

758
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.470
and a physician?

759
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:21.970
Look on Master Fenton:' this is my doing.

760
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:26.170
I thank thee; and I pray thee,

761
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:27.430
once to-night

762
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:30.570
Give my sweet Nan this ring:

763
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.330
there's for thy pains.

764
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:37.230
Now heaven send thee good fortune!

765
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:43.670
A kind heart he hath:

766
00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:44.600
a woman would run

767
00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.830
through fire and water

768
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:48.670
for such a kind heart.

769
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.000
But yet I would my master

770
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.170
had Mistress Anne;

771
00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:59.130
or I would Master Slender had her;

772
00:30:59.130 --> 00:30:59.930
or, in sooth,

773
00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:03.430
I would Master Fenton had her;

774
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:07.770
I will do what I can for them all three;

775
00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:08.930
for so I have promised,

776
00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:12.030
and I'll be as good as my word;

777
00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:15.630
but speciously for Master Fenton.

778
00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:17.870
Well, I must of another errand

779
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:19.230
to Sir John Falstaff

780
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.000
from my two mistresses:

781
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.730
what a beast am I to slack it!

782
00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:37.270
(music)

783
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.100
Bardolph, I say,--

784
00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.170
Here, sir.

785
00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:50.230
Go fetch me a quart of sack;

786
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.770
put a toast in't.

787
00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:05.570
Have I lived to be carried in a basket,

788
00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:07.970
like a barrow of butcher's offal,

789
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:11.570
and to be thrown in the Thames?

790
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:13.000
Well, if I be served such another trick,

791
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.770
I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered,

792
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:15.600
and give them to a dog

793
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.700
for a new-year's gift.

794
00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.670
The rogues slighted me into the river

795
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.000
with as little remorse

796
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:22.770
as they would have drowned

797
00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:23.670
a blind bitch's puppies,

798
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:25.670
fifteen i' the litter:

799
00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.230
and you may know by my size

800
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.200
that I have a kind of alacrity

801
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.270
in sinking;

802
00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.730
if the bottom were as deep as hell,

803
00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:33.630
I should down.

804
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:34.730
I had been drowned,

805
00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:36.930
but that the shore was shelvy

806
00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:41.670
and shallow,--a death that I abhor;

807
00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:45.570
for the water swells a man;

808
00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:47.230
and what a thing should I have been

809
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:48.770
when I had been swelled!

810
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:52.530
I should have been a mountain of mummy.

811
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.630
Here's Mistress Quickly, sir,

812
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:07.200
to speak with you.

813
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.370
Let me pour in some sack

814
00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:09.470
to the Thames water;

815
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:10.670
for my belly's as cold

816
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.600
as if I had swallowed snowballs

817
00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.200
for pills to cool the kidneys.

818
00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:21.500
Call her in.

819
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.970
Come in, woman!

820
00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:26.730
By your leave; I cry you mercy:

821
00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:28.970
give your worship good morrow.

822
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:34.000
Take away these chalices.

823
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.830
Go brew me a pottle of sack finely.

824
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:39.400
With eggs, sir?

825
00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.370
Simple of itself;

826
00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:44.370
I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage.

827
00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.830
How now!

828
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:55.800
Marry, sir,

829
00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.800
I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.

830
00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.400
Mistress Ford!

831
00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.830
I have had enough of ford;

832
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:03.930
I was thrown into the ford;

833
00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:06.570
I have my belly full of ford.

834
00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:07.370
Alas the day! good heart,

835
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:09.070
that was not her fault:

836
00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:11.100
she does so take on with her men;

837
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.670
they mistook their erection.

838
00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:13.670
So did I mine,

839
00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:17.470
to build upon a foolish woman's promise.

840
00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:21.700
Well, she laments, sir, for it,

841
00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:25.630
that it would yearn your heart to see it.

842
00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:32.600
Her husband goes this morning a-birding;

843
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.130
she desires you once more

844
00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:40.830
to come to her between eight and nine:

845
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:43.670
I must carry her word quickly:

846
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:50.200
she'll make you amends, I warrant you.

847
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.430
Well, I will visit her:

848
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:56.870
tell her so;

849
00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:59.200
and bid her think what a man is:

850
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.270
let her consider his frailty,

851
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:04.000
and then judge of my merit.

852
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.200
I will tell her.

853
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.870
Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?

854
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:09.000
Eight and nine, sir.

855
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Well, be gone: I will not miss her.

856
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.130
Peace be with you, sir.

857
00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:21.170
I marvel I hear not of Master Brook;

858
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.570
he sent me word to stay within:

859
00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:28.230
I like his money well. O, here he comes.

860
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:29.270
Bless you, sir!

861
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:30.470
Now, master Brook,

862
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:32.430
you come to know what hath passed

863
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:35.270
between me and Ford's wife?

864
00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:40.600
That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.

865
00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.800
Master Brook, I will not lie to you:

866
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.600
I was at her house the hour she appointed me.

867
00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.970
And sped you, sir?

868
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:51.230
Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.

869
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:52.030
How so, sir?

870
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:53.930
Did she change her determination?

871
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.100
No, Master Brook;

872
00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.070
but the peaking Cornuto her husband,

873
00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:59.230
Master Brook,

874
00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:02.930
comes me in the instant of our encounter,

875
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:04.900
after we had embraced,

876
00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:06.200
kissed,

877
00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.600
protested,

878
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.030
and, as it were,

879
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:12.170
spoke the prologue of our comedy;

880
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.000
and at his heels a rabble of his companions,

881
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.530
thither provoked and instigated

882
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:16.470
by his distemper, and,

883
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:19.130
forsooth, to search his house

884
00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:20.400
for his wife's love.

885
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.730
What, while you were there?

886
00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:22.830
While I was there.

887
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:24.270
And did he search for you,

888
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:26.070
and could not find you?

889
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.630
You shall hear.

890
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:30.370
As good luck would have it,

891
00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:32.000
comes in one Mistress Page;

892
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.970
gives intelligence of Ford's approach;

893
00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:35.600
and, in her invention

894
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.100
and Ford's wife's distraction,

895
00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:41.070
they conveyed me into a buck-basket.

896
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:43.200
A buck-basket!

897
00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.970
By the Lord, a buck-basket!

898
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:52.700
crammed me in with foul shirts and smocks,

899
00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.970
socks, foul stockings,

900
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:57.500
greasy napkins;

901
00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.070
that, Master Brook,

902
00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:02.900
there was the rankest compound

903
00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:07.670
of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.

904
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:09.670
And how long lay you there?

905
00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:14.800
Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook,

906
00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.370
what I have suffered to bring this woman

907
00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:21.630
to evil for your good.

908
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.830
Being thus crammed in the basket,

909
00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:25.530
a couple of Ford's knaves,

910
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:26.400
his hinds,

911
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.630
were called forth by their mistress

912
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:31.270
to carry me in the name of foul clothes

913
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:33.330
to Datchet-lane:

914
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:37.200
they took me on their shoulders;

915
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.900
met the jealous knave their master

916
00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:39.630
in the door,

917
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.030
who asked them once or twice

918
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:44.000
what they had in their basket:

919
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:46.330
I quaked for fear,

920
00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:47.570
lest the lunatic knave

921
00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.730
would have searched it;

922
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:51.370
but fate, ordaining

923
00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:55.030
he should be a cuckold, held his hand.

924
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.870
Well: on went he for a search,

925
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:58.700
and away went I for foul clothes.

926
00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:04.200
But mark the sequel, Master Brook:

927
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.670
I suffered the pangs

928
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.570
of three several deaths;

929
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.070
first, an intolerable fright,

930
00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.030
to be detected

931
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:15.670
with a jealous rotten bell-wether;

932
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:17.630
next, to be compassed,

933
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:20.670
in the circumference of a peck,like a good bilbo,

934
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.170
hilt to point, heel to head;

935
00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:25.970
and then, to be stopped in,

936
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.630
like a strong distillation,

937
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.830
with stinking clothes that fretted

938
00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:31.930
in their own grease:

939
00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:33.470
think of that,

940
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:34.970
--a man of my kidney,

941
00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.730
--think of that,

942
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:37.470
--that am as subject

943
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:39.000
to heat as butter;

944
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.100
a man of continual dissolution

945
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.370
and thaw:

946
00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:45.230
it was a miracle to scape suffocation.

947
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:48.600
And in the height of this bath,

948
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.300
when I was more than half stewed in grease,

949
00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:51.670
like a Dutch dish,

950
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:55.100
to be thrown into the Thames,

951
00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.270
and cooled, glowing hot,

952
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.770
in that surge, like a horse-shoe;

953
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.330
think of that,

954
00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:02.100
--hissing hot,

955
00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.630
--think of that, Master Brook.

956
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:04.870
In good sadness,

957
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:06.670
I am sorry that for my sake

958
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.770
you have sufferd all this.

959
00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:10.370
My suit then is desperate;

960
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:12.730
you'll undertake her no more?

961
00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:14.800
Master Brook,

962
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.630
I will be thrown into Etna,

963
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.730
as I have been into Thames,

964
00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:21.300
ere I will leave her thus.

965
00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.830
Her husband is this morning

966
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.700
gone a-birding:

967
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.070
I have received from her

968
00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:36.870
another embassy of meeting;

969
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:39.130
'twixt eight and nine is the hour,

970
00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:40.570
Master Brook.

971
00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:42.700
'Tis past eight already, sir.

972
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.630
Is it?

973
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.670
I will then address me to my appointment.

974
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:47.270
Come to me at your convenient leisure,

975
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:50.270
and you shall know how I speed;

976
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:54.730
Adieu.

977
00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:02.400
You shall have her, Master Brook;

978
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:09.200
Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.

979
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:18.600
Hum! ha! is this a vision?

980
00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.970
is this a dream?

981
00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:22.300
do I sleep?

982
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.830
Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!

983
00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:26.730
there's a hole made

984
00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:29.570
in your best coat, Master Ford.

985
00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:31.630
This 'tis to be married!

986
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:34.670
this 'tis to have linen and buck-baskets!

987
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:36.800
Well, I will proclaim myself

988
00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.900
what I am:

989
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.530
I will now take the lecher;

990
00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:41.570
he is at my house;

991
00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:43.000
he cannot 'scape me;

992
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.370
'tis impossible he should;

993
00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:46.670
he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,

994
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:48.500
nor into a pepper-box:

995
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.870
but, lest the devil that guides him

996
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:51.100
should aid him,

997
00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.970
I will search impossible places.

998
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:55.830
Though what I am I cannot avoid,

999
00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:56.530
yet to be what I would not

1000
00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:58.600
shall not make me tame:

1001
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.270
if I have horns to make one mad,

1002
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:02.500
let the proverb go with me:

1003
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:05.470
I'll be horn-mad.

1004
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:17.470
(music)

1005
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:20.470
