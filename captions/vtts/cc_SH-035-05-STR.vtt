00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.200


2
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.270
If you go on thus, youwill kill yourself:

3
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.800
And 'tis not wisdomthus to second grief

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.700
Against yourself.

5
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.770
I pray thee, ceasethy counsel,

6
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.130
Which falls into mineears as profitless

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.570
As water in a sieve:give not me counsel;

8
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.770
Nor let no comforterdelight mine ear

9
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.300
But such a one whosewrongs do suit with mine.

10
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.030
Bring me a fatherthat so loved his child,

11
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.430
Whose joy of her isoverwhelm'd like mine,

12
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.600
And bid himspeak of patience;

13
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.730
Measure his woe the lengthand breadth of mine

14
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.030
And let it answer everystrain for strain,

15
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.100
As thus for thus andsuch a grief for such,

16
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.870
In every lineament,branch, shape, and form:

17
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.470
If such a one will smileand stroke his beard,

18
00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.570
bring him yet to me, And I ofhim will gather patience.

19
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.970
But there is no suchman: for, brother,

20
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.730
men Can counsel and speakcomfort to that grief

21
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.930
Which they themselvesnot feel;

22
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.570
but, tasting it, Theircounsel turns to passion,

23
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.200
which before Would givepreceptial medicine to rage,

24
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.670
Fetter strong madnessin a silken thread,

25
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.430
Charm ache with airand agony with words:

26
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.930
No, no; 'tis all men'soffice to speak patience

27
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.770
To those that wringunder the load of sorrow,

28
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.800
But no man's virtuenor sufficiency

29
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.200
To be so moral when he shallendure The like himself.

30
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.370
Therefore give meno counsel:

31
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.100
My griefs cry louderthan advertisement.

32
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.570
Therein do men fromchildren nothing differ.

33
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.870
I pray thee, peace.

34
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.830
I will be flesh and blood; Forthere was never yet philosopher

35
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.970
That could endure thetoothache patiently,

36
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.830
However they have writthe style of gods

37
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.700
And made a push atchance and sufferance.

38
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.400
Yet bend not all theharm upon yourself;

39
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.170
Make those that dooffend you suffer too.

40
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.930
There thouspeak'st reason: nay,

41
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.670
I will do so.

42
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.770
My soul doth tellme Hero is belied;

43
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.130
And that shallClaudio know;

44
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.000
so shall the prince And all ofthem that thus dishonour her.

45
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.630
Here comes the princeand Claudio hastily.

46
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.800
Good den, good den.

47
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.530
Good day to both of you.

48
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.700
Hear you. my lords,--

49
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.630
We have some haste, Leonato.

50
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.100
Some haste, my lord!

51
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.830
well, fare you well, mylord: Are you so hasty now?

52
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.370
well, all is one.

53
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.270
Nay, do not quarrelwith us, good old man.

54
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.070
If he could righthimself with quarreling,

55
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.700
Some of us would lie low.

56
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.770
Who wrongs him?

57
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.170
Marry, thou dost wrong me;thou dissembler, thou:--

58
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.900
Nay, never lay thyhand upon thy sword;

59
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.170
I fear thee not.

60
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.800
Marry, beshrew my hand,If it should give your age

61
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.230
such cause of fear:

62
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.070
In faith, my hand meantnothing to my sword.

63
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.300
Tush, tush, man; neverfleer and jest at me:

64
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.330
I speak not like adotard nor a fool,

65
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.870
As under privilegeof age to brag

66
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.170
What I have done being young, orwhat would do Were I not old.

67
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.870
Know, Claudio,to thy head,

68
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.770
Thou hast so wrong'd mineinnocent child and me

69
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.500
That I am forced tolay my reverence by

70
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.200
And, with grey hairs andbruise of many days,

71
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.300
Do challenge theeto trial of a man.

72
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.930
I say thou hast beliedmine innocent child;

73
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.570
Thy slander hath gone throughand through her heart,

74
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.730
And she lies buriedwith her ancestors;

75
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.970
O, in a tomb wherenever scandal slept,

76
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.770
Save this of hers,framed by thy villany!

77
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.530
My villany?

78
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.000
Thine, Claudio;thine, I say.

79
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.330
You say notright, old man.

80
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.370
My lord, my lord, I'llprove it on his body,

81
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.830
if he dare, Despite his nicefence and his active practise,

82
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.930
His May of youth andbloom of lustihood.

83
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.300
Away!

84
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.000
I will not haveto do with you.

85
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.830
Canst thou so daff me?

86
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.970
Thou hast kill'd my child:If thou kill'st me, boy,

87
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.330
thou shalt kill a man.

88
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.200
He shall kill two ofus, and men indeed:

89
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.930
But that's no matter;let him kill one first;

90
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.170
Win me and wear me;let him answer me.

91
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.570
Come, follow me, boy;

92
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.330
come, sir boy, come,follow me: Sir boy,

93
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.400
I'll whip you fromyour foining fence;

94
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.630
Nay, as I am agentleman, I will.

95
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.170
Brother,--Content yourself.

96
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.200
God knows Iloved my niece;

97
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.400
And she is dead, slander'dto death by villains,

98
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.730
That dare as wellanswer a man indeed

99
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.570
As I dare take aserpent by the tongue:

100
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.870
Boys, apes, braggarts,Jacks, milksops!

101
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.870
Brother Antony,--

102
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.030
Hold you content. What,man! I know them,

103
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.300
yea, And what they weigh,

104
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.770
even to theutmost scruple,

105
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.830
- Scrambling, out-facing,fashion-monging boys,

106
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.770
That lie andcog and flout,

107
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.070
deprave and slander,

108
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.870
Go anticly, showoutward hideousness,

109
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.100
And speak off half adozen dangerous words,

110
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.870
How they might hurt theirenemies, if they durst;

111
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.270
And this is all. But,brother Antony,--

112
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.130
Come, 'tis no matter:Do not you meddle;

113
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.570
let me deal in this.

114
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.000
Gentlemen both, we willnot wake your patience.

115
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.530
My heart is sorry foryour daughter's death:

116
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.600
But, on my honour, shewas charged with nothing

117
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.270
But what was true andvery full of proof.

118
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.870
My lord, my lord,--

119
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.430
I will not hear you.

120
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.930
No? Come, brother;away! I will be heard.

121
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.330
And shall, or some ofus will smart for it.

122
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.630
See, see; here comesthe man we went to seek.

123
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.570
Now, signior, what news?

124
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.330
Good day, my lord.

125
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.770
Welcome, signior: you are almostcome to part almost a fray.

126
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.670
We had like to have hadour two noses snapped off

127
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.330
with two old menwithout teeth.

128
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.030
Leonato and his brother.

129
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.430
What thinkest thou?

130
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.700
Had we fought, I doubt we shouldhave been too young for them.

131
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.470
In a false quarrelthere is no true valour.

132
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.700
I came to seek you both.

133
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.330
We have been up anddown to seek thee;

134
00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.830
for we are high-proofmelancholy

135
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.970
and would fain haveit beaten away.

136
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.400
Wilt thou use thy wit?

137
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.330
It is in myscabbard: shall I draw it?

138
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.830
Dost thou wear thywit by thy side?

139
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.930
Never any did so,

140
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.930
though very many havebeen beside their wit.

141
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.930
I will bid thee draw,as we do the minstrels;

142
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.970
draw, to pleasure us.

143
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.730
As I am an honestman, he looks pale.

144
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.330
Art thou sick, or angry?

145
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.670
What, courage, man!

146
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.070
What thoughcare killed a cat,

147
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.330
thou hast mettle enoughin thee to kill care.

148
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.570
Sir, I shall meetyour wit in the career,

149
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.100
and you chargeit against me.

150
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.400
I pray you chooseanother subject.

151
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.570
Nay, then, give himanother staff:

152
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.170
this last was broke cross.

153
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.630
By this light, hechanges more and more:

154
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.600
I think he be angry indeed.

155
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.830
If he be, he knowshow to turn his girdle.

156
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.000
Shall I speak aword in your ear?

157
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.270
God bless mefrom a challenge!

158
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.900
You are a villain; I jest not:

159
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.900
I will make it goodhow you dare,

160
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.830
with what you dare,and when you dare.

161
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.270
Do me right, or I willprotest your cowardice.

162
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.530
You have killeda sweet lady,

163
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.700
and her death shallfall heavy on you.

164
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.830
Let me hear from you.

165
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.400
Well, I will meet you,so I may have good cheer.

166
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.370
What, a feast, a feast?

167
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.400
I' faith, I thank him;

168
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.030
he hath bid me to acalf's head and a capon;

169
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.770
the which if I do notcarve most curiously,

170
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.230
say my knife's naught.

171
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.130
Shall I not finda woodcock too?

172
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.170
Sir, your wit ambleswell; it goes easily.

173
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:52.800
I'll tell thee how Beatricepraised thy wit the other day.

174
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.000
I said, thou hadst a fine wit:

175
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.230
'True, said she, 'afine little one.'

176
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.700
'No, said I, 'a great wit:'

177
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.430
'Right, says she, 'agreat gross one.'

178
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.730
'Nay, said I, 'a good wit:'

179
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.800
'Just, said she,'it hurts nobody.'

180
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.130
'Nay, said I, 'thegentleman is wise:'

181
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.100
'Certain, said she,'a wise gentleman.'

182
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.170
'Nay, said I, 'hehath the tongues:'

183
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.630
'That I believe, said she,

184
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.300
'for he swore a thingto me on Monday night,

185
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.370
which he forswore onTuesday morning;

186
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.830
there's a double tongue;there's two tongues.'

187
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.000
Thus did she, an hour together,

188
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.470
transshape thyparticular virtues:

189
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:44.200
yet at last sheconcluded with a sigh,

190
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.970
thou wast theproperest man in Italy.

191
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.030
For the which she wept heartilyand said she cared not.

192
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.530
Yea, that she did: butyet, for all that,

193
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.170
an if she did nothate him deadly,

194
00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:01.370
she would love him dearly:the old man's daughter

195
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:02.870
told us all.

196
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.400
All, all; and, moreover,

197
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.500
God saw him when he washid in the garden.

198
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.930
But when shall we setthe savage bull's horns

199
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.530
on the sensibleBenedick's head?

200
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.030
Yea, and text underneath,

201
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.770
'Here dwells Benedickthe married man'?

202
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Fare you well, boy:you know my mind.

203
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.430
I will leave you now toyour gossip-like humour:

204
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.130
you break jests asbraggarts do their blades,

205
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.570
which God bethanked, hurt not.

206
00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:41.700
My lord, for your manycourtesies I thank you:

207
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.770
I must discontinueyour company:

208
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:48.700
your brother the bastardis fled from Messina:

209
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.000
you have among you killed asweet and innocent lady.

210
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.800
For my LordLackbeard there,

211
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.570
he and I shall meet:

212
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.770
and, till then,peace be with him.

213
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.900
He is in earnest.

214
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.930
In profound earnest;

215
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:16.200
and, I'll warrant you, forthe love of Beatrice.

216
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.930
And hath challenged thee.

217
00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.630
Most sincerely.

218
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.030
What a pretty thing man is

219
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:28.430
when he goes in his doublet andhose and leaves off his wit!

220
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.800
But, soft you, let me be:

221
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:37.300
pluck up, my heart, and be sad.

222
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.470
Did he not say, mybrother was fled?

223
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.200
Come you, sir: ifjustice cannot tame you,

224
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.370
she shall ne'er weigh morereasons in her balance:

225
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.330
nay, an you be acursing hypocrite once,

226
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.900
you must be looked to.

227
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.770
How now?

228
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.630
two of mybrother's men bound!

229
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.930
Borachio one!

230
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.930
Hearken after theiroffence, my lord.

231
00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.430
Officers, what offencehave these men done?

232
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.230
Marry, sir, they havecommitted false report;

233
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.130
moreover, theyhave spoken untruths;

234
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.700
secondarily,they are slanders;

235
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.130
sixth and lastly,they have belied a lady;

236
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.130
thirdly, they haveverified unjust things;

237
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:20.230
and, to conclude,they are lying knaves.

238
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:25.630
First, I ask theewhat they have done;

239
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.170
thirdly, I ask theewhat's their offence;

240
00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.630
sixth and lastly, whythey are committed;

241
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:37.270
and, to conclude, whatyou lay to their charge.

242
00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.370
Rightly reasoned, andin his own division:

243
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.800
Who have youoffended, masters,

244
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.800
that you are thusbound to your answer?

245
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.100
this learned constable is toocunning to be understood:

246
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.630
what's your offence?

247
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:53.430
Sweet prince, let me go nofarther to mine answer:

248
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:56.670
do you hear me, and letthis count kill me.

249
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.330
I have deceived evenyour very eyes:

250
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.770
what your wisdomscould not discover,

251
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.300
these shallow foolshave brought to light:

252
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.870
who in the night overheardme confessing to this man

253
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.300
how Don John your brother

254
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.170
incensed me to slanderthe Lady Hero,

255
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.230
how you were broughtinto the orchard

256
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:18.100
and saw me court Margaretin Hero's garments,

257
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.100
how you disgraced her,when you should marry her:

258
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.100
my villany theyhave upon record;

259
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.100
which I had ratherseal with my death

260
00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.670
than repeat overto my shame.

261
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:31.600
The lady is dead upon mine andmy master's false accusation;

262
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.400
and, briefly, I desire nothing

263
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.530
but the rewardof a villain.

264
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.870
Runs not this speech likeiron through your blood?

265
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:46.500
I have drunk poisonwhiles he utter'd it.

266
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.570
But did my brotherset thee on to this?

267
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:52.130
Yea, and paid me richlyfor the practise of it.

268
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:56.270
He is composed andframed of treachery:

269
00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.130
And fled he is uponthis villany.

270
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.500
Sweet Hero!

271
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.600
now thy image doth appear

272
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.430
In the rare semblancethat I loved it first.

273
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.430
Come, bring awaythe plaintiffs:

274
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:07.570
by which time

275
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.530
our sexton hath reformedSignior Leonato of the matter:

276
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.430
and, masters, do notforget to specify,

277
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.570
when time andplace shall serve,

278
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.230
that I am an ass.

279
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.300
Here, here comesmaster Signior Leonato,

280
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.830
and the Sexton too.

281
00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.300
Which is the villain?

282
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.570
let me see his eyes, That, whenI note another man like him,

283
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.570
I may avoid him: whichof these is he?

284
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.700
If you would know yourwronger, look on me.

285
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.970
Art thou the slave

286
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.470
that with thy breath hastkill'd Mine innocent child?

287
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.730
Yea, even I alone.

288
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:43.230
No, not so, villain;thou beliest thyself:

289
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.100
Here stand a pairof honourable men;

290
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.170
A third is fled,that had a hand in it.

291
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:51.670
I thank you, princes,for my daughter's death:

292
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.100
Record it with yourhigh and worthy deeds:

293
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.800
'Twas bravely done, ifyou bethink you of it.

294
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.230
I know not how topray your patience;

295
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:07.570
Yet I must speak.

296
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.500
Choose yourrevenge yourself;

297
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.570
Impose me to whatpenance your invention

298
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:20.830
Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'dI not But in mistaking.

299
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.700
By my soul, nor I:

300
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.770
And yet, to satisfythis good old man,

301
00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.430
I would bend underany heavy weight

302
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.100
That he'll enjoin me to.

303
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.370
I cannot bid youbid my daughter live;

304
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:40.570
That were impossible:but, I pray you both,

and if your love Can labourought in sad invention,

308
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.730
Hang her an epitaphupon her tomb

309
00:14:52.730 --> 00:15:01.870
And sing it to her bones,sing it to-night:

356
00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:16.770
Come, neighbour.

357
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.600
Until to-morrow morning,lords, farewell.

358
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.230
Farewell, my lords: welook for you to-morrow.

359
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.870
We will not fail.

360
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.400
To-night I'llmourn with Hero.

361
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.800
Bring youthese fellows on.

362
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.100
We'll talk with Margaret,

363
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:45.870
How her acquaintance grewwith this lewd fellow.

364
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.970
Pray thee, sweetMistress Margaret,

365
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.600
deserve well at my hands

366
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.730
by helping me to thespeech of Beatrice.

367
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.200
Will you then write me a sonnetin praise of my beauty?

368
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.570
In so high astyle, Margaret,

369
00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.970
that no man livingshall come over it;

370
00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.770
for, in most comelytruth, thou deservest it.

371
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.430
To have no mancome over me!

372
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.930
why, shall I alwayskeep below stairs?

373
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.400
Thy wit is as quick asthe greyhound's mouth;

374
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.230
Margaret, it catches.

375
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.430
And yours as blunt asthe fencer's foils,

376
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.730
which hit, but hurt not.

377
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.100
A most manlywit, Margaret;

378
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.370
it will not hurt a woman:

379
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:35.670
and so, I pray thee,call Beatrice:

380
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:36.900
I give thee the bucklers.

381
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:41.570
Give us the swords; wehave bucklers of our own.

382
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:45.200
If you use them, Margaret,

383
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.400
you must put in thepikes with a vice;

384
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.200
and they are dangerousweapons for maids.

385
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.100
Well, I will callBeatrice to you,

386
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.970
who I think hath legs.

387
00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:04.800
And therefore will come.

388
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:20.700
The god of love,That sits above,

389
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:26.830
And knows me,and knows me,

390
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:36.200
How pitiful I deserve,--I mean in singing;

391
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.830
but in loving,Leander the good swimmer,

392
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.830
Troilus the firstemployer of panders,

393
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.870
and a whole bookful of thesequondam carpet-mangers,

394
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.630
whose names yetrun smoothly

395
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.230
in the even roadof a blank verse,

396
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.630
why, they were never sotruly turned over and over

397
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:56.270
as my poor self in love.

398
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.730
Marry, I cannotshow it in rhyme;

399
00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:03.930
I have tried: I can find out norhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,'

400
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:10.600
an innocent rhyme;for 'scorn, 'horn,'

401
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.230
a hard rhyme; for,'school,' 'fool,'

402
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.830
a babbling rhyme; veryominous endings:

403
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.900
no, I was not born undera rhyming planet,

404
00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:24.670
nor I cannot woo infestival terms.

405
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:31.230
Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thoucome when I called thee?

406
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.000
Yea, signior, anddepart when you bid me.

407
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.630
O, stay but till then!

408
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:41.230
'Then' is spoken;fare you well now:

409
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:46.730
and yet, ere I go, letme go with that I came;

410
00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.700
which is, with knowingwhat hath passed

411
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.770
between you and Claudio.

412
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.500
Only foul words; andthereupon I will kiss thee.

413
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.930
Foul words isbut foul wind,

414
00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.700
and foul wind isbut foul breath,

415
00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.070
and foulbreath is noisome;

416
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.030
therefore I willdepart unkissed.

417
00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:05.370
Thou hast frighted the wordout of his right sense,

418
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:09.500
so forcible is thy wit.

419
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.230
But I must tellthee plainly,

420
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.030
Claudioundergoes my challenge;

421
00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.500
and either I mustshortly hear from him,

422
00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:20.030
or I willsubscribe him a coward.

423
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:42.530
I pray you, tell mefor which of my bad parts

424
00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:47.300
didst thou first fallin love with me?

425
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.300
For them all together;

426
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.330
which maintained sopolitic a state of evil

427
00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.000
that they will notadmit any good part

428
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.570
to intermingle with them.

429
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:55.930
But for which ofmy good parts

430
00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.530
did you first sufferlove for me?

431
00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.370
Suffer love!

432
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:02.030
a good epithet!

433
00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.870
I do suffer love indeed, forI love thee against my will.

434
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.100
In spite of yourheart, I think;

435
00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.830
alas, poor heart!

436
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:11.900
If you spiteit for my sake,

437
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.630
I will spite it for yours;for I will never love

438
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.700
that which myfriend hates.

439
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:20.870
Thou and I are toowise to woo peaceably.

440
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.030
It appears not inthis confession:

441
00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:24.470
there's not one wiseman among twenty

442
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.330
that will praise himself.

443
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.870
An old, an oldinstance, Beatrice,

444
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.800
that lived in thelime of good neighbours.

445
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:38.930
If a man do not erect in thisage his own tomb ere he dies,

446
00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.330
he shall live nolonger in monument

447
00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.400
than the bell ringsand the widow weeps.

448
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.600
And how long isthat, think you?

449
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:49.230
Question: why, an hour inclamour and a quarter in rheum:

450
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:54.570
therefore is it mostexpedient for the wise,

451
00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.200
if his conscience, find noimpediment to the contrary,

452
00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.170
to be the trumpetof his own virtues,

453
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:04.230
as I am to myself.

454
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.830
So much forpraising myself,

455
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:14.230
who, I myself will bearwitness, is praiseworthy:

456
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.770
how doth your cousin?

457
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.200
Very ill.

458
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.300
And how do you?

459
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.100
Very ill too.

460
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:33.570
Serve God,love me and mend.

461
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.030
There will I leave you too,for here comes one in haste.

462
00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.970
Madam, you mustcome to your uncle.

463
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:44.500
Yonder's old coil at home:

464
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.230
it is proved my Lady Herohath been falsely accused,

465
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.830
the prince and Claudiomightily abused;

466
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.800
and Don John is theauthor of all,

467
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.470
who is fed and gone.

468
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.500
Will you come presently?

469
00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.570
Will you go hearthis news, signior?

470
00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.170
I will live in thyheart, die in thy lap,

471
00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:02.530
and be buried in thy eyes;

472
00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:07.200
and moreover I will gowith thee to thy uncle's.

473
00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:33.170
(♪music)

474
00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:38.970
(♪music)

475
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.400
Is this themonument of Leonato?

476
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.430
It is, my lord.

477
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.200
Done to death byslanderous tongues

478
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.630
Was the Hero that here lies:

479
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:32.300
Death, in guerdonof her wrongs,

480
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:37.170
Gives her famewhich never dies.

481
00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.600
So the life thatdied with shame

482
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:47.200
Lives in death withglorious fame.

483
00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:53.170
Hang thou thereupon the tomb,

484
00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:57.430
Praising herwhen I am dumb.

485
00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:04.400
Now, music, sound, andsing your solemn hymn.

486
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:13.430
(♪SONG)

487
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:18.000
Pardon, goddessof the night,

488
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.730
Those that slewthy virgin knight;

489
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:27.730
For the which,with songs of woe,

490
00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:32.400
Round about hertomb they go.

491
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:42.030
Midnight, assist our moan;Help us to sigh and groan,

492
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:46.770
Graves, yawn and yieldyour dead,

493
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:51.500
Till death be uttered,

494
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:56.070
Now, unto thybones good night!

495
00:26:56.070 --> 00:27:01.400
Yearly will Ido this rite.

496
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.330
(end of song)

497
00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:15.500
Good morrow, masters;put your torches out:

498
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.900
The wolves have prey'd;

499
00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.500
and look, the gentle day,Before the wheels of Phoebus,

500
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:27.470
round about Dapples the drowsyeast with spots of grey.

501
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:32.600
Thanks to you all, andleave us: fare you well.

502
00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:37.600
Good morrow, masters:each his several way.

503
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:42.100
Come, let us hence,and put on other weeds;

504
00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.530
And then toLeonato's we will go.

505
00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:47.630
And Hymen now withluckier issue speed's

506
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:52.170
Than this for whom werender'd up this woe.

507
00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:58.870
Did I not tell youshe was innocent?

508
00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:00.800
So are theprince and Claudio,

509
00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.900
who accused her Upon the errorthat you heard debated:

510
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.900
But Margaret was insome fault for this,

511
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.130
Although against herwill, as it appears

512
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.030
In the true course ofall the question.

513
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.400
Well, I am glad thatall things sort so well.

514
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.930
And so am I, being elseby faith enforced

515
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:21.270
To call young Claudioto a reckoning for it.

516
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:24.000
Daughter, andyou gentle-women all,

517
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.230
Withdraw to achamber by yourselves,

518
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:29.630
And when I send foryou, come hither mask'd.

519
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:35.170
The prince and Claudio promisedby this hour To visit me.

520
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.930
You know your office, brother:

521
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.970
You must be father toyour brother's daughter

522
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.370
And give her to young Claudio.

523
00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.170
Which I will do withconfirm'd countenance.

524
00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:49.970
Friar, I must entreatyour pains, I think.

525
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:51.500
To do what, signior?

526
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:57.130
To bind me, orundo me; one of them.

527
00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:00.170
Signior Leonato, truthit is, good signior,

528
00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:02.730
Your niece regards mewith an eye of favour.

529
00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:07.500
That eye my daughterlent her: 'tis most true.

530
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.070
And I with an eyeof love requite her.

531
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.470
The sight whereof Ithink she got from me,

532
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:17.170
From Claudioand the prince:

533
00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.530
Your answer, sir,is enigmatical:

534
00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:21.470
But, what's your will,

535
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:27.500
my will? Oh, my will,is your good will

536
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.700
This day may stand with ours,to be conjoin'd

537
00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.770
In the state ofhonourable marriage:

538
00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:36.370
In which, good friar, Ishall desire your help.

539
00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:38.700
My heart iswith your liking.

540
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.970
And my help.

541
00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:43.500
Here comes theprince and Claudio.

542
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.400
Good morrow to thisfair assembly.

543
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.670
Good morrow, prince;good morrow, Claudio:

544
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:50.170
We here attend you.

545
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:51.430
Are you yet determined

546
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.300
To-day to marry with mybrother's daughter?

547
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.730
I'll hold my mind,were she an Ethiope.

548
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:04.200
Call her forth, brother;here's the friar ready.

549
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:07.270
Good morrow, Benedick.

550
00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:08.530
Why, what's the matter,

551
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:11.270
That you have sucha February face,

552
00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:15.270
So full of frost, ofstorm and cloudiness?

553
00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.200
I think he thinksupon the savage bull.

554
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.130
Tush, fear not, man; we'lltip thy horns with gold

555
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.970
And all Europashall rejoice at thee,

556
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:25.770
As once Europadid at lusty Jove,

557
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:27.630
When he would play thenoble beast in love.

558
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.870
Bull Jove, sir,had an amiable low;

559
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:35.170
And some such strange bullleap'd your father's cow,

560
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.930
And got a calf inthat same noble feat

561
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:42.130
Much like to you, for youhave just his bleat.

562
00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:47.700
For this I owe you: herecomes other reckonings.

563
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.470
Which is the ladyI must seize upon?

564
00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:04.100
This same is she,and I do give you her.

565
00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.470
Why, then she's mine.

566
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:07.700
Sweet, let mesee your face.

567
00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:11.830
No, that you shall not,till you take her hand

568
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:17.470
Before this friar andswear to marry her.

569
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:22.570
Give me your hand:before this holy friar,

570
00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:26.570
I am your husband,if you like of me.

571
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:31.170
And when I lived, Iwas your other wife:

572
00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:35.470
And when you loved,you were my other husband.

573
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:36.830
Another Hero!

574
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:40.500
Nothing certainer:One Hero died defiled,

575
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.470
but I do live, Andsurely as I live,

576
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.430
I am a maid.

577
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.930
The former Hero!

578
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:49.900
Hero that is dead!

579
00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:54.730
She died, my lord, butwhiles her slander lived.

580
00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.670
All this amazementcan I qualify:

581
00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:59.330
When after that theholy rites are ended,

582
00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:03.700
I'll tell you largelyof fair Hero's death:

583
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.930
Meantime let wonderseem familiar,

584
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:10.230
And to the chapellet us presently.

585
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:15.730
Soft and fair, friar.

586
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:17.470
Which is Beatrice?

587
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:21.130
I answer to that name.

588
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:23.100
What is your will?

589
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.000
Do not you love me?

590
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.230
(laughing)

591
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:32.530
Why, no; nomore than reason.

592
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.400
Why, then your uncle andthe prince and Claudio

593
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.570
Have been deceived;they swore you did.

594
00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:38.630
Do not you love me?

595
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:41.000
Troth, no; nomore than reason.

596
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.170
Why, then my cousin Margaretand Ursula Are much deceived;

597
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:47.070
for they did swear you did.

598
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.700
They swore that youwere almost sick for me.

599
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.100
They swore that you werewell-nigh dead for me.

600
00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.400
'Tis no such matter.

601
00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.330
Then you do not love me?

602
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.530
No, truly, but infriendly recompense.

603
00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:59.700
Come, cousin, I am sureyou love the gentleman.

604
00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.730
And I'll be swornupon't that he loves her;

605
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.930
For here's a paperwritten in his hand,

606
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:06.300
A halting sonnet ofhis own pure brain,

607
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.100
Fashion'd to Beatrice.

608
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.530
And here's anotherWrit in my cousin's hand,

609
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:12.030
stolen from her pocket,

610
00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:18.830
Containing her affectionunto Benedick.

611
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.330
A miracle!

612
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:26.530
here's our own handsagainst our hearts.

613
00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:27.670
Come, I will have thee;

614
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.830
but, by this light, Itake thee for pity.

615
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:34.370
I would not deny you;but, by this good day,

616
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.570
I yield upongreat persuasion;

617
00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:38.770
and partly tosave your life,

618
00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:40.100
for I was told youwere in a consumption.

619
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:47.300
Peace! I willstop your mouth.

620
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:57.300
How dost thou,Benedick, the married man?

621
00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.830
I'll tell theewhat, prince;

622
00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:03.730
a college of wit-crackers cannotflout me out of my humour.

623
00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:06.930
Dost thou think I care fora satire or an epigram?

624
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:09.630
No: if a man will bebeaten with brains,

625
00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.130
a' shall wear nothinghandsome about him.

626
00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:15.970
In brief, since Ido purpose to marry,

627
00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:18.000
I will think nothingto any purpose

628
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.830
that the world cansay against it;

629
00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.400
and therefore neverflout at me

630
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.530
for what I havesaid against it;

631
00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:32.530
for man is a giddy thing,and this is my conclusion.

632
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.870
Claudio, I did think to havebeaten thee,

633
00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:41.870
but in that thou artlike to be my kinsman,

634
00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:44.100
live unbruisedand love my cousin.

635
00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:45.670
I had well hoped thou wouldsthave denied Beatrice,

636
00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:48.200
that I might have cudgelledthee out of thy single life,

637
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.770
to make thee a double-dealer;

638
00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:51.170
which, out of question,thou wilt be,

639
00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:54.170
if my cousin do not lookexceedingly narrowly to thee.

640
00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:56.230
Come, come, we are friends:

641
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:58.270
let's have a danceere we are married,

642
00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:01.670
that we may lighten our ownhearts and our wives' heels.

643
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:04.470
We'll havedancing afterward.

644
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.170
First, of myword;

645
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.830
Prince, thou artsad; thou art sad.

646
00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:11.570
get thee a wife,get thee a wife:

647
00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.900
there is no staff more reverendthan one tipped with horn.

648
00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:20.370
My lord, your brotherJohn is ta'en in flight,

649
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:22.730
And brought with armedmen back to Messina.

650
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:25.430
Think not on himtill to-morrow:

651
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:28.300
I'll devise thee bravepunishments for him.

652
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:32.300
Strike up, pipers.

653
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:37.930
(♪music)

654
00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.700
