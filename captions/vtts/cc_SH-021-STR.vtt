00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.800
â™ª Oh blessed King.So full of virtue,

3
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.970
the flower of knighthood,ne'er defiled.

4
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:04.770
the brave for us,to Christ Jesu.

5
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:13.300
and to his mother, merry mild.

6
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.000
In all thy works,was never wild

7
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.900
but full of graceand charity

8
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.470
Merciful everto man and child

9
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.730
Now sweet King Henrypray for me.

10
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.400
Oh crown'd Kingwith septor in hand

11
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.730
Most noble conquerer,I thee call

12
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.300
For thou has conquered,I understand.

13
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.470
Thy Henry Kingdomimperial.

14
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.870
Where joy are boundethand grace perpetual,

15
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:07.070
In presence of the one in three

16
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.330
Now of thy gracemake me apart

17
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:34.470
and sweet King Henrypray for me.

18
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.400
(Group) Amen

19
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.430
Hung be the heavens withblack, yield day to night!

20
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.970
Comets, importing changeof times and states,

21
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.800
Brandish your crystaltresses in the sky,

22
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.770
And with them scourge thebad revolting stars

23
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.470
That have consented untoHenry's death!

24
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.470
Henry the Fifth, toofamous to live long!

25
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.670
England ne'er lost a kingof so much worth.

26
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.800
England ne'er had a kinguntil his time.

27
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.600
Virtue he had, deservingto command:

28
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.800
His brandish'd sword didblind men with his beams:

29
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.400
His arms spread wider thana dragon's wings;

30
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.670
His sparking eyes, repletewith wrathful fire,

31
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.630
More dazzled and droveback his enemies

32
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.730
Than mid-day sun fiercebent against their faces.

33
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.900
What should I say? hisdeeds exceed all speech:

34
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.170
He ne'er lift up his handbut conquered.

35
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.570
We mourn in black: whymourn we not in blood?

36
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.500
Henry is dead and nevershall revive:

37
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.470
Upon a wooden coffin weattend,

38
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.900
And death's dishonourablevictory

39
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.000
We with our statelypresence glorify,

40
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.570
Like captives bound to atriumphant car.

41
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.300
What! shall we curse theplanets of mishap

42
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.200
That plotted thus ourglory's overthrow?

43
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.000
Or shall we think thesubtle-witted French

44
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.230
Conjurers and sorcerers,that afraid of him

45
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.600
By magic verses havecontrived his end?

46
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.870
He was a king bless'd ofthe King of kings.

47
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.530
Unto the French thedreadful judgement-day

48
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.970
So dreadful will not be aswas his sight.

49
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.330
The battles of the Lord ofhosts he fought:

50
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.570
The church's prayers madehim so prosperous.

51
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.030
The church! where is it?Had not churchmen pray'd,

52
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.900
His thread of life had notso soon decay'd:

53
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.270
None do you like but aneffeminate prince,

54
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.700
Whom, like a school-boy,you may over-awe.

55
00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.570
Gloucester, whate'er welike, thou art protector

56
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.900
And lookest to command theprince and realm.

57
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.300
Thy wife is proud; sheholdeth thee in awe,

58
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.870
More than God or religiouschurchmen may.

59
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.530
Name not religion, forthou lovest the flesh,

60
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.130
And ne'er throughout theyear to church thou go'st

61
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.800
Except it be to prayagainst thy foes.

62
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.430
Cease, cease these jars andrest your minds in peace:

63
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.530
Let's to the altar:heralds, wait on us:

64
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.470
Instead of gold, we'lloffer up our arms:

65
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.970
Since arms avail not nowthat Henry's dead.

66
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.630
Henry the Fifth, thy ghostI invocate:

67
00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:01.100
Prosper this realm, keepit from civil broils,

68
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.300
Combat with adverseplanets in the heavens!

69
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.670
A far more glorious starthy soul shall make

70
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.900
Than Julius Caesar orbright--

71
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:15.030
My honourable lords,health to you all!

72
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.200
Sad tidings bring I to youout of France,

73
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.400
Of loss, of slaughter anddiscomfiture:

74
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.400
Guienne, Champagne,Rheims, Orleans,

75
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.370
Paris, Guysors, Poictiers,are all quite lost.

76
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.400
What say'st thou, man,before dead Henry's corse?

77
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.270
Speak softly, or the lossof those great towns

78
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.230
Will make him burst hislead and rise from death.

79
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.270
Is Paris lost? is Rouenyielded up?

80
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.130
If Henry were recall'd tolife again,

81
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.730
These news would cause himonce more yield the ghost.

82
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.030
How were they lost? whattreachery was used?

83
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:05.100
No treachery; but want ofmen and money.

84
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.730
Amongst the soldiers thisis muttered,

85
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.970
That here you maintainseveral factions,

86
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.170
And whilst a field shouldbe dispatch'd and fought,

87
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.270
You are disputing of yourgenerals:

88
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.330
One would have lingeringwars with little cost;

89
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.830
Another would fly swift,but wanteth wings;

90
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.500
A third thinks, withoutexpense at all,

91
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.600
By guileful fair wordspeace may be obtain'd.

92
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.070
Awake, awake, Englishnobility!

93
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.800
Let not sloth dim yourhorrors new-begot:

94
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.300
Cropp'd are theflower-de-luces in your arms;

95
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.030
Of England's coat one halfis cut away.

96
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.800
Were our tears wanting tothis funeral,

97
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.900
These tidings would callforth their flowing tides.

98
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.300
Me they concern; Regent Iam of France.

99
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.030
Give me my steeled coat.I'll fight for France.

100
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.670
Away with thesedisgraceful wailing robes!

101
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.000
Wounds will I lend theFrench instead of eyes,

102
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.500
To weep their intermissivemiseries.

103
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:14.330
Lords, view these lettersfull of bad mischance.

104
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.100
France is revolted fromthe English quite,

105
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.400
Except some petty towns ofno import:

106
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.930
The Dauphin Charles iscrowned king of Rheims;

107
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.230
The Bastard of Orleanswith him is join'd;

108
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.430
Reignier, Duke of Anjou,doth take his part;

109
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.230
The Duke of Alencon fliethto his side.

110
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:32.270
The Dauphin crowned king!all fly to him!

111
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.200
O, whither shall we flyfrom this reproach?

112
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.470
We will not fly, but toour enemies' throats.

113
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.330
Bedford, if thou be slack,I'll fight it out.

114
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.000
Gloucester, why doubt'stthou of my forwardness?

115
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.730
An army have I muster'd inmy thoughts,

116
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.000
Wherewith already Franceis overrun.

117
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.970
My gracious lords, to addto your laments,

118
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.530
Wherewith you now bedewKing Henry's hearse,

119
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.630
I must inform you of adismal fight

120
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.200
Betwixt the stout LordTalbot and the French.

121
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.900
What! wherein Talbotovercame? is't so?

122
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.730
O, no; wherein Lord Talbotwas o'erthrown:

123
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:14.100
The circumstance I'll tellyou more at large.

124
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.130
The tenth of August lastthis dreadful lord,

125
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.670
Retiring from the siege ofOrleans,

126
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.170
Having full scarce sixthousand in his troop.

127
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.930
By three and twentythousand of the French

128
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.830
Was round encompassed andset upon.

129
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.470
No leisure had he toenrank his men;

130
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.670
He wanted pikes to setbefore his archers;

131
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.370
Instead whereof sharp stakespluck'd out of hedges

132
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.770
They pitched in the groundconfusedly,

133
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.830
To keep the horsemen offfrom breaking in.

134
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.970
More than three hours thefight continued;

135
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.430
Where valiant Talbot abovehuman thought

136
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.330
Enacted wonders with hissword and lance:

137
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.830
Hundreds he sent to hell,and none durst stand him;

138
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.270
Here, there, and everywhere, enraged he flew:

139
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.170
The French exclaim'd, thedevil was in arms;

140
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.830
All the whole army stoodagazed on him:

141
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:12.470
His soldiers spying hisundaunted spirit

142
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.100
A Talbot! a Talbot! criedout amain

143
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.830
And rush'd into the bowelsof the battle.

144
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:21.030
Here had the conquestfully been seal'd up,

145
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:25.370
If Sir John Fastolfe hadnot play'd the coward:

146
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.000
He, being in the vaward,placed behind

147
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.200
With purpose to relieveand follow them,

148
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.470
Cowardly fled, not havingstruck one stroke.

149
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.930
Hence grew the generalwreck and massacre;

150
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:42.230
Enclosed were they withtheir enemies:

151
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.600
A base Walloon, to win theDauphin's grace,

152
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.600
Thrust Talbot with a spearinto the back,

153
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.100
Whom all France with theirchief assembled strength

154
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.870
Durst not presume to lookonce in the face.

155
00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:01.530
Is Talbot slain? then Iwill slay myself,

156
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.570
For living idly here inpomp and ease,

157
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.470
Whilst such a worthyleader, wanting aid,

158
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.930
Unto his dastard foemen isbetray'd.

159
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:11.100
O no, he lives; but istook prisoner,

160
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.630
And Lord Scales with himand Lord Hungerford:

161
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:18.870
Most of the rest slaughter'dor took likewise.

162
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.400
His ransom there is nonebut I shall pay:

163
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:27.570
I'll hale the Dauphinheadlong from his throne:

164
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.770
His crown shall be theransom of my friend;

165
00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.800
Four of their lords I'llchange for one of ours.

166
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.130
Farewell, my masters; tomy task will I;

167
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.430
Bonfires in Franceforthwith I am to make,

168
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.200
To keep our great SaintGeorge's feast withal:

169
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.500
Ten thousand soldiers withme I will take,

170
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:51.430
Whose bloody deeds shallmake all Europe quake.

171
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.970
So you had need; forOrleans is besieged;

172
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.130
The English army is grownweak and faint:

173
00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.300
The Earl of Salisburycraveth supply,

174
00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.970
And hardly keeps his menfrom mutiny,

175
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:06.200
Since they, so few, watchsuch a multitude.

176
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.300
Remember, lords, youroaths to Henry sworn,

177
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.230
Either to quell theDauphin utterly,

178
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.300
Or bring him in obedienceto your yoke.

179
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.700
I do remember it; and heretake my leave,

180
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.400
To go about mypreparation.

181
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.870
I'll to the Tower with allthe haste I can,

182
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.900
To view the artillery andmunition;

183
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:29.170
And then I will proclaimyoung Henry king.

184
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.370
To Eltham will I, wherethe young king is,

185
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.670
Being ordain'd his specialgovernor,

186
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.530
And for his safety thereI'll best devise.

187
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:53.230
Each hath his place andfunction to attend:

188
00:13:53.230 --> 00:14:00.430
I am left out; for menothing remains.

189
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:05.070
But long I will not beJack out of office:

190
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.700
The king from Eltham Iintend to steal

191
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:14.030
And sit at chiefest sternof public weal.

192
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.830
Mars his true moving, evenas in the heavens

193
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.170
So in the earth, to thisday is not known:

194
00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.300
Late did he shine upon theEnglish side;

195
00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.070
Now we are victors; uponus he smiles.

196
00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.770
What towns of any momentbut we have?

197
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.230
At pleasure here we lienear Orleans;

198
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.330
Otherwhiles the famish'dEnglish, like pale ghosts,

199
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:11.400
Faintly besiege us onehour in a month.

200
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.900
They want their porridgeand their fat bull-beeves:

201
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.970
Either they must be dietedlike mules

202
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.070
And have their provendertied to their mouths

203
00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:27.300
Or piteous they will look,like drowned mice.

204
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:32.370
Let's raise the siege: whylive we idly here?

205
00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:35.730
Talbot is taken, whom wewont to fear:

206
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:40.770
Remaineth none butmad-brain'd Salisbury;

207
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.270
And he may well infretting spend his gall,

208
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.000
Nor men nor money hath heto make war.

209
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.570
Sound, sound alarum! wewill rush on them.

210
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.800
Now for the honour of theforlorn French!

211
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.330
Him I forgive my deaththat killeth me

212
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:58.970
When he sees me go backone foot or fly.

213
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.530
Who ever saw the like?what men have I!

214
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:32.300
Dogs! cowards! dastards! Iwould ne'er have fled,

215
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.530
But that they left me'midst my enemies.

216
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.900
Salisbury is a desperatehomicide;

217
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.500
He fighteth as one wearyof his life.

218
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.570
The other lords, likelions wanting food,

219
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.900
Do rush upon us as theirhungry prey.

220
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:50.700
Lean, raw-boned rascals!who would e'er suppose

221
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:55.830
They had such courage andaudacity?

222
00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:00.930
Let's leave this town; forthey are hare-brain'd slaves,

223
00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.400
And hunger will enforcethem to be more eager:

224
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.000
Of old I know them; ratherwith their teeth

225
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.500
The walls they'll tear downthan forsake the siege.

226
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.630
I think, by some oddgimmors or device

227
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:15.070
Their arms are set likeclocks, still to strike on;

228
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:18.070
Else ne'er could they holdout so as they do.

229
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:22.630
By my consent, we'll evenlet them alone.

230
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.430
Be it so.

231
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:29.600
Where's the Prince Dauphin?I have news for him.

232
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.470
Bastard of Orleans, thricewelcome to us.

233
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:35.430
Methinks your looks aresad, your cheer appall'd:

234
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.370
Hath the late overthrowwrought this offence?

235
00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:43.000
Be not dismay'd, forsuccor is at hand:

236
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.170
A holy maid hither with meI bring,

237
00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.330
Which by a vision sent toher from heaven

238
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.930
Ordained is to raise thistedious siege

239
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:54.070
And drive the English forththe bounds of France.

240
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.830
The spirit of deepprophecy she hath,

241
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.700
Exceeding the nine sibylsof old Rome:

242
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.200
What's past and what's tocome she can descry.

243
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.770
Speak, shall I call herin? Believe my words,

244
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.070
For they are certain andunfallible.

245
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.300
Go, call her in.

246
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.530
But first, to try herskill,

247
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:19.930
Reignier, stand thou asDauphin in my place:

248
00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:24.700
Question her proudly; letthy looks be stern:

249
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.030
By this means shall wesound what skill she hath.

250
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:39.870
Fair maid, is't thou wiltdo these wondrous feats?

251
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:44.800
Reignier, is't thou thatthinkest to beguile me?

252
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:51.300
Where is the Dauphin?Come, come from behind;

253
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:57.200
I know thee well, thoughnever seen before.

254
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.130
Be not amazed, there'snothing hid from me:

255
00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.600
In private will I talkwith thee apart.

256
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.930
Stand back, you lords, andgive us leave awhile.

257
00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:08.730
She takes upon her bravelyat first dash.

258
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.570
Dauphin, I am by birth ashepherd's daughter,

259
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.370
My wit untrain'd in anykind of art.

260
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.570
Heaven and our Ladygracious hath it pleased

261
00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:26.100
To shine on mycontemptible estate:

262
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.170
Lo, whilst I waited on mytender lambs,

263
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:34.170
And to sun's parching heatdisplay'd my cheeks,

264
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.670
God's mother deigned toappear to me

265
00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.630
And in a vision full ofmajesty

266
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.370
Will'd me to leave my basevocation

267
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.070
And free my country fromcalamity:

268
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:48.300
Her aid she promised andassured success:

269
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.700
In complete glory shereveal'd herself;

270
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.830
And, whereas I was blackand swart before,

271
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.430
With those clear rayswhich she infused on me

272
00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:00.470
That beauty am I bless'dwith which you see.

273
00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.700
Ask me what question thoucanst possible,

274
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.970
And I will answerunpremeditated:

275
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:11.070
My courage try by combat,if thou darest,

276
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:14.830
And thou shalt find that Iexceed my sex.

277
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:18.000
Resolve on this, thoushalt be fortunate,

278
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.030
If thou receive me for thywarlike mate.

279
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.230
Thou hast astonish'd mewith thy high terms:

280
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.900
Only this proof I'll ofthy valour make,

281
00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.600
In single combat thoushalt buckle with me,

282
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.700
And if thou vanquishest,thy words are true;

283
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.230
Otherwise I renounce allconfidence.

284
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.230
I am prepared: here is mykeen-edged sword,

285
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.130
Deck'd with fiveflower-de-luces on each side;

286
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.170
The which at Touraine, inSaint Katharine's churchyard,

287
00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.870
Out of a great deal ofold iron I chose forth.

288
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.630
Then come, o' God's name;I fear no woman.

289
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.370
And while I live, I'llne'er fly from a man.

290
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:28.600
Stay, stay thy hands! thouart an Amazon

291
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.970
And fightest with thesword of Deborah.

292
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.400
Christ's mother helps me,else I were too weak.

293
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.630
Whoe'er helps thee, 'tisthou that must help me:

294
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.870
Impatiently I burn withthy desire;

295
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:45.430
My heart and hands thouhast at once subdued.

296
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.730
Excellent Pucelle, if thyname be so,

297
00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.800
Let me thy servant and notsovereign be:

298
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.930
'Tis the French Dauphinsueth to thee thus.

299
00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.930
I must not yield to anyrites of love,

300
00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:04.870
For my profession's sacredfrom above:

301
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.370
When I have chased all thyfoes from hence,

302
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.970
Then will I think upon arecompense.

303
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:17.970
Meantime look gracious onthy prostrate thrall.

304
00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:24.830
Methinks, My Lord isvery long in talk.

305
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.870
Doubtless he shrives thiswoman to her smock;

306
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:30.770
Else ne'er could he solong protract his speech.

307
00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.130
Shall we disturb him,since he keeps no mean?

308
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.300
He may mean more than wepoor men do know:

309
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:41.400
These women are shrewdtempters with their tongues.

310
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:49.430
My lord, where are you?what devise you on?

311
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.630
Shall we give overOrleans, or no?

312
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:55.230
Why, no, I say,distrustful recreants!

313
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:59.100
Fight till the last gasp;I will be your guard.

314
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.830
What she says I'll confirm:we'll fight it out.

315
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.970
Assign'd am I to be theEnglish scourge.

316
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.870
This night the siegeassuredly I'll raise:

317
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:12.400
Expect Saint Martin'ssummer, halcyon days,

318
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.730
Since I have entered intothese wars.

319
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.800
Glory is like a circle inthe water,

320
00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.570
Which never ceaseth toenlarge itself

321
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:25.570
Till by broad spreading itdisperse to nought.

322
00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:28.800
With Henry's death theEnglish circle ends;

323
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.800
Dispersed are the gloriesit included.

324
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.270
Now am I like that proudinsulting ship

325
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:38.970
Which Caesar and hisfortunes bare at once.

326
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:42.370
Bright star of Venus,fall'n down on the earth,

327
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:44.070
How may I reverentworship thee enough?

328
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:47.030
Leave off delays, and letus raise the siege.

329
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.670
Woman, do what thou canstto save our honours;

330
00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.800
Drive them from Orleansand be immortalized.

331
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.970
Presently we'll try: come,let's away about it:

332
00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:58.230
No prophet will I trust,if she prove false.

333
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.700
I am come to survey theTower this day:

334
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.200
Since Henry's death, Ifear, there is conveyance.

335
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.300
Where be these warders,that they wait not here?

336
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:35.770
Open the gates; The Duke ofGloucester calls.

337
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:41.100
[Within] Who's there thatknockth so imperiously?

338
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.370
(First Serving-Man) It is thenoble Duke of Gloucester.

339
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:46.330
[Within] Whoe'er he be,you may not be let in.

340
00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:47.830
(First Serving-Man)Villains, answer you

341
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.970
so the lord protector?

342
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.730
[Within] The Lord protecthim! so we answer him:

343
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:56.600
We do no otherwise than weare will'd.

344
00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.730
Who willed you? or whosewill stands but mine?

345
00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:03.970
There's none protector ofthe realm but I.

346
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:09.130
Break up the gates, I'llbe your warrantize.

347
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:15.130
Shall I be flouted thus bydunghill grooms?

348
00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.730
What noise is this? whattraitors have we here?

349
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:20.770
Lieutenant, is it youwhose voice I hear?

350
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.230
Open the gates; here'sGloucester that would enter.

351
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:26.600
Have patience, noble duke;I may not open;

352
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.870
His grace, My Lord ofWinchester forbids:

353
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:31.100
From him I have expresscommandment

354
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:35.070
That thou nor none ofthine shall be let in.

355
00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:39.870
Faint-hearted Woodvile,prizest him 'fore me?

356
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:41.970
Arrogant Winchester,that haughty prelate,

357
00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:45.100
Whom Henry, our latesovereign, ne'er could brook?

358
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.570
Thou art no friend to Godor to the king:

359
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:51.130
Open the gates, or I'llshut thee out shortly.

360
00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:55.370
(Serving-Men) Open the gatesunto the lord protector,

361
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:59.670
Or we'll burst them open, ifthat you come not quickly.

362
00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.800
How now, ambitiousHumphry! what means this?

363
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.830
Peel'd priest, dost thoucommand me to be shut out?

364
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.470
I do, thou most usurpingproditor,

365
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.000
And not protector, of theking or realm.

366
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.230
Stand back, thou manifestconspirator,

367
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:42.970
Thou that contrivedst tomurder our dead lord;

368
00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.230
Thou that givest whoresindulgences to sin:

369
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:49.000
Nay, stand thou back, Iwill not budge a foot:

370
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.630
This be Damascus, be thoucursed Cain,

371
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:55.070
To slay thy brother Abel,if thou wilt.

372
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:57.530
I will not slay thee, butI'll drive thee back:

373
00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:02.830
Do what thou darest; Ibeard thee to thy face.

374
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:08.170
What! am I dared andbearded to my face?

375
00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:11.430
Draw, men, for all thisprivileged place;

376
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:15.430
Blue coats to tawny coats.Priest, beware your beard,

377
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:18.130
I mean to tug it and tocuff you soundly:

378
00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:21.800
Here by the cheeks I'lldrag thee up and down.

379
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.000
Gloucester, thou wilt answerthis before the pope.

380
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.200
Winchester goose, I cry, arope! a rope!

381
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:35.670
Now beat them hence; whydo you let them stay?

382
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:40.600
Thee I'll chase hence, thouwolf in sheep's array.

383
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:55.370
Fie, lords! that you,being supreme magistrates,

384
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:58.870
Thus contumeliously shouldbreak the peace!

385
00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:02.570
Peace, mayor! thou know'stlittle of my wrongs:

386
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:05.100
Here's Beaufort, thatregards nor God nor king,

387
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.600
Hath here distrain'd theTower to his use.

388
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.930
Here's Gloucester, a foeto citizens,

389
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:12.870
One that still motions warand never peace,

390
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.830
O'ercharging your freepurses with large fines,

391
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:17.800
And would have armour hereout of the Tower,

392
00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:22.030
To crown himself king andsuppress the prince.

393
00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:24.600
I will not answer theewith words, but blows.

394
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:29.430
Naught rests for me inthis tumultuous strife

395
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.570
But to make openproclamation:

396
00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:35.000
Come, officer; as loud ase'er thou canst,

397
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:42.230
All manner of men assembledhere in arms this day

398
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:45.230
against God's peace andthe king's, we charge

399
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:47.530
and command you, in hishighness' name, to repair to

400
00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:50.670
your several dwelling-places;and not to wear,

401
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:54.470
handle, or use any sword,weapon, or dagger,

402
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:58.200
henceforward, upon pain ofdeath.

403
00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:03.270
Winchester, I'll be nobreaker of the law:

404
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.970
But we shall meet, andbreak our minds at large.

405
00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:10.530
Gloucester, we will meet;to thy cost, be sure:

406
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:14.170
Thy heart-blood I willhave for this day's work.

407
00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:18.170
I'll call for clubs, ifyou will not away.

408
00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:20.230
This Winchester's morehaughty than the devil.

409
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:24.230
Mayor, farewell: thou dostbut what thou mayst.

410
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.770
Abominable Gloucester,guard thy head;

411
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:32.330
For I intend to have itere long.

412
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.930
See the coast clear'd, andthen we will depart.

413
00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:47.830
Good God, these noblesshould such stomachs bear!

414
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.100
I myself fight not once inforty year.

415
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:08.270
Sirrah, thou know'st howOrleans is besieged,

416
00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:11.230
And how the English havethe suburbs won.

417
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:13.370
Father, I know; and ofthave shot at them,

418
00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:15.770
Howe'er unfortunate Imiss'd my aim.

419
00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:21.800
(Master-Gunner) But now thoushalt not. Be thou ruled by me:

420
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.300
Chief master-gunner am Iof this town;

421
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:28.070
Something I must do toprocure me grace.

422
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:32.130
The prince's espials haveinformed me

423
00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:35.000
How the English, in thesuburbs close intrench'd,

424
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.870
Wont, through a secretgrate of iron bars

425
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:44.000
In yonder tower, tooverpeer the city,

426
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.570
And thence discover howwith most advantage

427
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:50.300
They may vex us with shot,or with assault.

428
00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.600
To intercept thisinconvenience,

429
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.400
A piece of ordnance'gainst it have I placed;

430
00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.730
And even these three days,

431
00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:58.900
watch'd If I could see them.

432
00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:04.130
Now do thou watch, forI can stay no longer.

433
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:08.530
If thou spy'st any, runand bring me word;

434
00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:12.500
And thou shalt find me atthe governor's.

435
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:17.530
Father, I warrant you;take you no care;

436
00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:20.900
I'll never trouble you, ifI may spy them.

437
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:48.070
Talbot, my life, my joy,again return'd!

438
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.370
How wert thou handledbeing prisoner?

439
00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:55.630
Or by what means got'stthou to be released?

440
00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.070
The Earl of Bedford had aprisoner

441
00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:00.930
Call'd the brave LordPonton de Santrailles;

442
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:04.930
For him was I exchangedand ransomed.

443
00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:07.600
In fine, redeem'd I was asI desired.

444
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.430
But, O! the treacherousFastolfe wounds my heart,

445
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:13.100
Whom with my bare fists Iwould execute,

446
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:16.870
If I now had him broughtinto my power.

447
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:23.830
Yet tell'st thou not howthou wert entertain'd.

448
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:28.570
With scoffs and scorns andcontumelious taunts.

449
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.000
In open market-placeproduced they me,

450
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.870
To be a public spectacleto all:

451
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:43.770
Here, said they, is theterror of the French,

452
00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:48.130
The scarecrow thataffrights our children so.

453
00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:49.870
Then broke I from theofficers that led me,

454
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:52.300
And with my nails digg'dstones out of the ground,

455
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.700
To hurl at the beholdersof my shame:

456
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.970
My grisly countenance madeothers fly;

457
00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.800
None durst come near forfear of sudden death.

458
00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:07.330
In iron walls they deem'dme not secure;

459
00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.900
So great fear of my name'mongst them was spread,

460
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.770
That they supposed I couldrend bars of steel,

461
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:16.200
And spurn in pieces postsof adamant:

462
00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:21.030
Wherefore a guard ofchosen shot I had,

463
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:24.500
That walked about me everyminute-while;

464
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.430
And if I did but stir outof my bed,

465
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:31.630
Ready they were to shootme to the heart.

466
00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:41.070
I grieve to hear whattorments you endured,

467
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:45.470
But we will be revengedsufficiently

468
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:47.270
Now it is supper-time inOrleans:

469
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:50.300
Here, through this tower,I count each one

470
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:54.330
and view the Frenchmen howthey fortify:

471
00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:57.570
Let us look in; the sightwill much delight thee.

472
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.830
Sir Thomas Gargrave, andSir William Glansdale,

473
00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:16.730
Let me have your expressopinions

474
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:18.770
Where is best place tomake our battery next.

475
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:21.200
I think, at the north gate;for there stand lords.

476
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.870
And I, here, at thebulwark of the bridge.

477
00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:27.330
For aught I see, this citymust be famish'd,

478
00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.500
Or with light skirmishesenfeebled.

479
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.230
O Lord, have mercy on us,wretched sinners!

480
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:54.130
O Lord, have mercy on me,woful man!

481
00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:58.600
What chance is this thatsuddenly hath cross'd us?

482
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.730
Speak, Salisbury; at least,if thou canst speak:

483
00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:07.000
How farest thou, mirror ofall martial men?

484
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:15.570
One of thy eyes and thycheek's side struck off!

485
00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:19.000
Accursed tower! accursedfatal hand

486
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.430
That hath contrived thiswoful tragedy!

487
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.670
In thirteen battlesSalisbury o'ercame;

488
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:33.430
Henry the Fifth he firsttrain'd to the wars;

489
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:36.800
Whilst any trump didsound, or drum struck up,

490
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:41.770
His sword did ne'er leavestriking in the field.

491
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:47.600
Yet livest thou, Salisbury?though thy speech doth fail,

492
00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.700
One eye thou hast, to lookto heaven for grace:

493
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:54.900
The sun with one eyevieweth all the world.

494
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.000
Heaven, be thou graciousto none alive,

495
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.130
If Salisbury wants mercyat thy hands!

496
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:09.930
What stir is this? whattumult's in the heavens?

497
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:12.870
Whence cometh this alarumand the noise?

498
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.400
My lord, my lord, theFrench have gathered head:

499
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.930
The Dauphin, with one Joanla Pucelle join'd,

500
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.070
A holy prophetess newrisen up,

501
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:25.170
Is come with a great powerto raise the siege.

502
00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:29.400
Hear, dyingSalisbury doth groan!

503
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:34.370
It irks his heart hecannot be revenged.

504
00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:43.270
Frenchmen, I'll be aSalisbury to you:

505
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:46.430
Puzzel or pucelle, dolphinor dogfish,

506
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:49.070
Your hearts I'll stamp outwith my horse's heels,

507
00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:53.900
And make a quagmire ofyour mingled brains.

508
00:36:53.900 --> 00:37:00.300
Convey me Salisbury intohis tent,

509
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:05.630
And then try what these dastardFrenchmen dare.

510
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:09.800
(Screaming)

511
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.370
Cry: A Talbot

512
00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:28.600
Joan of France and laPucelle

513
00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.570
Where is my strength, myvalour, and my force?

514
00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:33.500
Our English troops retire,I cannot stay them:

515
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:39.670
A woman clad in armourchaseth them.

516
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:47.570
Here, here she comes. I'llhave a bout with thee;

517
00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:51.900
Devil or devil's dam, I'llconjure thee:

518
00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.670
Blood will I draw on thee,thou art a witch,

519
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:57.170
And straightway give thysoul to him thou servest.

520
00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.670
Come, come, 'tis only Ithat must disgrace thee.

521
00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:22.500
Heavens, can you sufferhell so to prevail?

522
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.830
My breast I'll burst withstraining of my courage

523
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.930
And from my shoulderscrack my arms asunder.

524
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:33.830
But I will chastise thishigh-minded strumpet.

525
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.800
Talbot, farewell; thy houris not yet come:

526
00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.830
I must go victor Orleansforthwith.

527
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:10.170
O'ertake me, if thou canst;I scorn thy strength.

528
00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:13.870
Go, go, cheer up thyhungry-starved men;

529
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:17.370
Help Salisbury to make histestament:

530
00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:22.670
This day is ours, as manymore shall be.

531
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:24.370
My mind are whirledlike a potter's wheel;

532
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.800
I know not where I am, norwhat I do;

533
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.670
A witch, by fear, notforce, like Hannibal,

534
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:33.600
Drives back our troops andconquers as she lists:

535
00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.900
They call'd us for ourfierceness English dogs;

536
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:45.200
Now, like to whelps, wecrying run away.

537
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:48.630
Hark, countrymen! eitherrenew the fight,

538
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.900
Or tear the lions out ofEngland's coat;

539
00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.830
Renounce your style, givesheep in lions' stead:

540
00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:57.070
Sheep run not half sotreacherous from the wolf,

541
00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.170
Or horse or oxen from theleopard,

542
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:04.700
As you fly from youroft-subdued slaves.

543
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:13.830
Cry: A Talbot

544
00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:30.000
It will not be: retireinto your trenches:

545
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.000
You all consented untoSalisbury's death,

546
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.100
For none would strike astroke in his revenge.

547
00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.770
Pucelle is enter'd intoOrleans,

548
00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:04.800
In spite of us or aughtthat we could do.

549
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:09.800
O, would I were to diewith Salisbury!

550
00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:14.200
The shame hereof will makeme hide my head.

551
00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:40.930
Advance our waving colourson the walls;

552
00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:00.470
Rescued is Orleans fromthe English

553
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:05.070
Thus Joan la Pucelle hathperform'd her word.

554
00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:10.330
Divinest creature,Astraea's daughter,

555
00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:12.200
How shall I honour theefor this success?

556
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.000
Why ring not out the bellsaloud throughout the town?

557
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.570
Dauphin, command thecitizens make bonfires

558
00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.130
And feast and banquet inthe open streets,

559
00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:23.800
To celebrate the joy thatGod hath given us.

560
00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:28.930
All France will be repletewith mirth and joy,

561
00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:32.670
When they shall hear howwe have play'd the men.

562
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:36.900
'Tis Joan, not we, by whomthe day is won;

563
00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:39.370
For which I will divide mycrown with her,

564
00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:41.670
And all the priests andfriars in my realm

565
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:45.900
Shall in procession singher endless praise.

566
00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.700
No longer on Saint Deniswill we cry,

567
00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:53.070
But Joan la Pucelle shallbe France's saint.

568
00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:00.100
Come in, and let usbanquet royally,

569
00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:03.800
After this golden day ofvictory.

570
00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:40.470
Sirs, take your places andbe vigilant:

571
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:42.230
If any noise or soldieryou perceive

572
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:45.100
Near to the walls, by someapparent sign

573
00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.070
Let us have knowledge atthe court of guard.

574
00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:50.130
Sergeant, you shall.

575
00:43:57.930 --> 00:43:59.400
Thus are poor servitors,

576
00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.230
When others sleep upontheir quiet beds,

577
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:08.400
Constrain'd to watch indarkness, rain and cold.

578
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:17.170
Lord Regent, and redoubtedBurgundy,

579
00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:19.730
By whose approach theregions of Artois,

580
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:22.700
Wallon and Picardy arefriends to us,

581
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.030
This happy night theFrenchmen are secure,

582
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.370
Having all day carousedand banqueted:

583
00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:29.970
Embrace we then thisopportunity

584
00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:32.330
As fitting best toquittance their deceit

585
00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:35.500
Contrived by art andbaleful sorcery.

586
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:39.070
Coward of France! how muchhe wrongs his fame,

587
00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:41.670
Despairing of his ownarm's fortitude,

588
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.600
To join with witches andthe help of hell!

589
00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.830
Traitors have never othercompany.

590
00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:51.300
But what's that Pucellewhom they term so pure?

591
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.730
A maid, they say.

592
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.800
A maid! and be so martial!

593
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.600
Pray God she prove notmasculine ere long,

594
00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.830
If underneath the standardof the French

595
00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:05.000
She carry armour as shehath begun.

596
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.670
Well, let them practiseand converse with spirits:

597
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:13.100
God is our fortress, inwhose conquering name

598
00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.700
Let us resolve to scaletheir flinty bulwarks.

599
00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:18.930
Ascend, brave Talbot; wewill follow thee.

600
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:22.470
Not all together: betterfar, I guess,

601
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:26.070
That we do make ourentrance several ways;

602
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:28.130
That, if it chance the oneof us do fail,

603
00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:30.430
The other yet may riseagainst their force.

604
00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:33.500
Agreed: I'll to yondcorner.

605
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:35.930
And I to this.

606
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:43.170
And there will Talbotmount, or make his grave.

607
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:46.230
Now, Salisbury, for thee,and for the right

608
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:48.770
Of English Henry, shallthis night appear

609
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:53.670
How much in duty I ambound to both.

610
00:45:56.770 --> 00:46:03.770
Arm! arm! the enemy dothmake assault!

611
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:11.100
Cry: 'St. George,' 'ATalbot.'

612
00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:31.030
How now, my lords! what,all unready so?

613
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:33.930
Unready! ay, and glad we'scaped so well.

614
00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:35.670
'Twas time, I trow, towake and leave our beds,

615
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:37.330
Hearing alarums at ourchamber-doors.

616
00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:39.330
I think this Talbot be afiend of hell.

617
00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:41.900
If not of hell, theheavens, sure, favour him.

618
00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.900
Here cometh Charles: Imarvel how he sped.

619
00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:47.130
Tut, holy Joan was hisdefensive guard.

620
00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.930
Is this thy cunning, thoudeceitful dame?

621
00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:50.830
Didst thou at first, toflatter us withal,

622
00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:52.530
Make us partakers of alittle gain,

623
00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:55.300
That now our loss might beten times so much?

624
00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.000
Wherefore is Charlesimpatient with his friend!

625
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.230
At all times will you havemy power alike?

626
00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:01.400
Sleeping or waking must Istill prevail,

627
00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:04.270
Or will you blame and laythe fault on me?

628
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:07.330
Improvident soldiers! hadyour watch been good,

629
00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:09.500
This sudden mischief nevercould have fall'n.

630
00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:12.000
Duke of Alencon, this wasyour default,

631
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.600
That, being captain of thewatch to-night,

632
00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.700
Did look no better to thatweighty charge.

633
00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:17.970
Had all your quarters beenas safely kept

634
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:19.370
As that whereof I had thegovernment,

635
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:21.870
We had not been thusshamefully surprised.

636
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:23.000
Mine was secure.

637
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.570
And so was mine, my lord.

638
00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:26.330
And, for myself, most partof all this night,

639
00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:29.700
Within her quarter andmine own precinct

640
00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.030
I was employ'd in passingto and fro,

641
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:33.730
About relieving of thesentinels:

642
00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:35.930
Then how or which wayshould they first break in?

643
00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:37.900
Question, my lords, nofurther of the case,

644
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.730
How or which way: 'tissure they found some place

645
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:44.700
But weakly guarded, wherethe breach was made.

646
00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:47.230
And now there rests noother shift but this;

647
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:49.270
To gather our soldiers,scatter'd and dispersed,

648
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:52.400
And lay new platforms toendamage them.

649
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:58.230
Cry: A Talbot

650
00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:14.830
I'll be so bold to takewhat they have left.

651
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.230
The cry of Talbot servesme for a sword;

652
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:23.530
For I have loaden me withmany spoils,

653
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:25.730
Using no other weapon buthis name.

654
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:35.930
Cry: A Talbot

655
00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:43.370
Here sound retreat, andcease our hot pursuit.

656
00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:05.970
The day begins to break,and night is fled,

657
00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:12.470
Whose pitchy mantleover-veil'd the earth.

658
00:49:52.770 --> 00:50:01.430
Now have I paid my vowto Salisbury's soul;

659
00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.870
For every drop of bloodwas drawn from him,

660
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:12.900
There hath at least fiveFrenchmen died tonight.

661
00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:14.530
And that hereafter agesmay behold

662
00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:17.670
What ruin happen'd inrevenge of him,

663
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:19.870
Within their chiefesttemple I'll erect

664
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:23.470
A tomb, wherein his corpseshall be interr'd:

665
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:26.400
Upon the which, that everyone may read,

666
00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.670
Shall be engraved the sackof Orleans,

667
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:34.230
The treacherous manner ofhis mournful death

668
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:39.370
And what a terror he hadbeen to France.

669
00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:43.300
Advance his body tothe marketplace,

670
00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:47.900
the middle center of thiscursed town.

671
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:17.830
But, lords, in all ourbloody massacre,

672
00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:21.770
I muse we met not with theDauphin's grace,

673
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:26.400
His new-come champion,virtuous Joan of Arc,

674
00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:29.070
Nor any of his falseconfederates.

675
00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:31.330
'Tis thought, Lord Talbot,when the fight began,

676
00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:34.130
Roused on the sudden fromtheir drowsy beds,

677
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:37.200
They did amongst thetroops of armed men

678
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.170
Leap o'er the walls forrefuge in the field.

679
00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:45.670
Myself, as far as I couldwell discern

680
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:49.000
For smoke and duskyvapours of the night,

681
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.170
Am sure I scared theDauphin and his trull,

682
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:54.270
When arm in arm they bothcame swiftly running,

683
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:58.370
Like to a pair of lovingturtle-doves

684
00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:03.130
That could not liveasunder day or night.

685
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:09.870
After that things are setin order here,

686
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:12.400
We'll follow them with allthe power we have.

687
00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:18.000
All hail, my lords! whichof this princely train

688
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.230
Call ye the warlikeTalbot, for his acts

689
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:24.500
So much applauded throughthe realm of France?

690
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:30.370
Here is the Talbot: whowould speak with him?

691
00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:33.500
The virtuous lady,Countess of Auvergne,

692
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.630
With modesty admiring thyrenown,

693
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:38.270
By me entreats, great lord,thou wouldst vouchsafe

694
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:42.030
To visit her poor castlewhere she lies,

695
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:43.970
That she may boast shehath beheld the man

696
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:46.800
Whose glory fills theworld with loud report.

697
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.230
Is it even so? Nay, then,I see our wars

698
00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:51.430
Will turn unto a peacefulcomic sport,

699
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:54.700
When ladies crave to beencounter'd with.

700
00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:58.270
You may not, my lord,despise her gentle suit.

701
00:52:58.270 --> 00:53:01.570
Ne'er trust me then; forwhen a world of men

702
00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:05.170
Could not prevail with alltheir oratory,

703
00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:08.830
Yet hath a woman'skindness over-ruled:

704
00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:11.970
And therefore tell her Ireturn great thanks,

705
00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:16.600
And in submission willattend on her.

706
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:23.230
Will not your honours bearme company?

707
00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:26.270
No, truly; it is more thanmanners will:

708
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:29.300
And I have heard it said,unbidden guests

709
00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:32.300
Are often welcomest whenthey are gone.

710
00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:34.630
Well then, alone, sincethere's no remedy,

711
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:41.000
I mean to prove thislady's courtesy.

712
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.230
Come hither, captain.

713
00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:52.270
You perceive my mind?

714
00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:55.100
I do, my lord, and meanaccordingly.

715
00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:06.630
Porter, remember what Igave in charge;

716
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:09.100
And when you have done so,bring the keys to me.

717
00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:12.000
Madam, I will.

718
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.330
The plot is laid: if allthings fall out right,

719
00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:15.870
I shall as famous be bythis exploit

720
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:18.670
As Scythian Tomyris byCyrus' death.

721
00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:21.300
Great is the rumor of thisdreadful knight,

722
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.030
And his achievements of noless account:

723
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:26.800
Fain would mine eyes bewitness with mine ears,

724
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.230
To give their censure ofthese rare reports.

725
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:30.430
Madam,

726
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:32.970
According as your ladyshipdesired,

727
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:34.970
By message craved, so isLord Talbot come.

728
00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:40.370
And he is welcome. What!is this the man?

729
00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:42.500
Madam, it is.

730
00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:46.570
Is this the scourge ofFrance?

731
00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:49.100
Is this the Talbot, somuch fear'd abroad

732
00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:54.330
That with his name themothers still their babes?

733
00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:58.370
I see report is fabulousand false:

734
00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:01.200
I thought I should haveseen some Hercules,

735
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.800
A second Hector, for hisgrim aspect,

736
00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:08.530
And large proportion ofhis strong-knit limbs.

737
00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:13.770
Alas, this is a child, asilly dwarf!

738
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:17.030
It cannot be this weak andwrithled shrimp

739
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:21.300
Should strike such terrorto his enemies.

740
00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:23.900
Madam, I have been bold totrouble you;

741
00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.400
But since your ladyship isnot at leisure,

742
00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:30.400
I'll sort some other timeto visit you.

743
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.730
What means he now? Go askhim whither he goes.

744
00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:35.330
Stay, my Lord Talbot; formy lady craves

745
00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:37.130
To know the cause of yourabrupt departure.

746
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:38.770
Marry, for that she's in awrong belief,

747
00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:44.670
I go to certify herTalbot's here.

748
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:49.400
If thou be he, then artthou prisoner.

749
00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.930
Prisoner! to whom?

750
00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:56.530
To me, blood-thirsty lord;

751
00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:59.970
And for that cause Itrained thee to my house.

752
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:03.000
Long time thy shadow hathbeen thrall to me,

753
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.470
For in my gallery thypicture hangs:

754
00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:08.700
But now the substanceshall endure the like,

755
00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:11.470
And I will chain theselegs and arms of thine,

756
00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:13.370
That hast by tyranny thesemany years

757
00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:15.600
Wasted our country, slainour citizens

758
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.970
And sent our sons andhusbands captivate.

759
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:26.370
Ha, ha, ha!

760
00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:30.430
Laughest thou, wretch? thymirth shall turn to moan.

761
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:32.530
I laugh to see yourladyship so fond

762
00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:35.270
To think that you haveaught but Talbot's shadow

763
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:38.570
Whereon to practise yourseverity.

764
00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:40.630
Why, art not thou the man?

765
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:42.530
I am indeed.

766
00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:44.070
Then have I substance too.

767
00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:47.770
No, no, I am but shadow ofmyself:

768
00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:51.300
You are deceived, mysubstance is not here;

769
00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.270
For what you see is butthe smallest part

770
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:55.530
And least proportion ofhumanity:

771
00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:58.730
I tell you, madam, werethe whole frame here,

772
00:56:58.730 --> 00:57:01.130
It is of such a spaciouslofty pitch,

773
00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:04.130
Your roof were notsufficient to contain't.

774
00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:06.030
This is a riddlingmerchant for the nonce;

775
00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:08.870
He will be here, and yethe is not here:

776
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:11.030
How can thesecontrarieties agree?

777
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:15.500
That will I show youpresently.

778
00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:38.300
How say you, madam? areyou now persuaded

779
00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:41.800
That Talbot is but shadowof himself?

780
00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:46.630
These are his substance,sinews, arms and strength,

781
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:48.270
With which he yoketh yourrebellious necks,

782
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:51.370
Razeth your cities andsubverts your towns

783
00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:55.800
And in a moment makes themdesolate.

784
00:57:55.800 --> 00:58:01.230
Victorious Talbot! pardonmy abuse:

785
00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:05.270
I find thou art no lessthan fame hath bruited

786
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:13.930
And more than may begather'd by thy shape.

787
00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:17.130
Let my presumption notprovoke thy wrath;

788
00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:19.670
For I am sorry that withreverence

789
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:23.130
I did not entertain theeas thou art.

790
00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:29.500
Be not dismay'd, fairlady; nor misconstrue

791
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:32.200
The mind of Talbot, as youdid mistake

792
00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:36.830
The outward composition ofhis body.

793
00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:38.900
What you have done hathnot offended me;

794
00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:41.300
Nor other satisfaction doI crave,

795
00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:45.530
But only, with yourpatience, that we may

796
00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:50.670
Taste of your wine and seewhat cates you have;

797
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:54.330
For soldiers' stomachsalways serve them well.

798
00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:57.930
With all my heart, andthink me honoured

799
00:58:57.930 --> 00:59:03.070
To feast so great awarrior in my house.

800
00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:51.130
Great lords and gentlemen,what means this silence?

801
00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:56.030
Dare no man answer in acase of truth?

802
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:58.900
Within the Temple-hall wewere too loud;

803
00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.000
The garden here is moreconvenient.

804
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.070
Then say at once if Imaintain'd the truth;

805
01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:08.430
Or else was wranglingSomerset in the error?

806
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:10.500
Faith, I have been atruant in the law,

807
01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.530
And never yet could framemy will to it;

808
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:15.930
And therefore frame thelaw unto my will.

809
01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.630
Judge you, my Lord ofWarwick, then, between us.

810
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:29.700
Between two hawks, whichflies the higher pitch;

811
01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:32.700
Between two dogs, whichhath the deeper mouth;

812
01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:36.000
Between two blades, whichbears the better temper:

813
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.330
Between two horses, whichdoth bear him best;

814
01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:45.330
Between two girls, whichhath the merriest eye;

815
01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:47.500
I have perhaps some shallowspirit of judgement;

816
01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:51.070
But in these nice sharpquillets of the law,

817
01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:56.770
Good faith, I am no wiserthan a daw.

818
01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:03.900
Tut, tut, here is amannerly forbearance:

819
01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.600
The truth appears so nakedon my side

820
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.170
That any purblind eye mayfind it out.

821
01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:09.700
And on my side it is sowell apparell'd,

822
01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.230
So clear, so shining andso evident

823
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:20.670
That it will glimmerthrough a blind man's eye.

824
01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:26.030
Since you are tongue-tiedand so loath to speak,

825
01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:30.930
In dumb significantsproclaim your thoughts:

826
01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:35.970
Let him that is atrue-born gentleman

827
01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:38.900
And stands upon the honourof his birth,

828
01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:42.730
If he suppose that I havepleaded truth,

829
01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:53.370
From off this brier plucka white rose with me.

830
01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:56.130
Let him that is no cowardnor no flatterer,

831
01:01:56.130 --> 01:02:01.900
But dare maintain theparty of the truth,

832
01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:10.100
Pluck a red rose from offthis thorn with me.

833
01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:17.870
I love no colours, andwithout all colour

834
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:21.100
Of base insinuatingflattery

835
01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:25.170
I pluck this white rosewith Plantagenet.

836
01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:32.100
I pluck this red rose withyoung Somerset

837
01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:35.030
And say withal I think heheld the right.

838
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:38.100
Stay, lords and gentlemen,and pluck no more,

839
01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.970
Till you conclude that heupon whose side

840
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:43.870
The fewest roses arecropp'd from the tree

841
01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:46.200
Shall yield the other inthe right opinion.

842
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.500
Good Master Vernon, it iswell objected:

843
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:53.200
If I have fewest, Isubscribe in silence.

844
01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.970
And I.

845
01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:58.470
Then for the truth andplainness of the case.

846
01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:01.030
I pluck this pale andmaiden blossom here,

847
01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:04.230
Giving my verdict on thewhite rose side.

848
01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:06.900
Prick not your finger asyou pluck it off,

849
01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.870
Lest bleeding you do paintthe white rose red

850
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:12.730
And fall on my side so,against your will.

851
01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:15.970
If I my lord, for myopinion bleed,

852
01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:18.470
Opinion shall be surgeonto my hurt

853
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:22.430
And keep me on the sidewhere now I am.

854
01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:35.800
Well, well, come on: whoelse?

855
01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:41.070
Unless my study and mybooks be false,

856
01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:45.070
The argument you held waswrong in you:

857
01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:53.630
In sign whereof I pluck awhite rose too.

858
01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:56.900
Now, Somerset, where isyour argument?

859
01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.830
Here in my scabbard,meditating that

860
01:03:58.830 --> 01:04:01.870
Shall dye your white rosein a bloody red.

861
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:06.670
Meantime your cheeks docounterfeit our roses;

862
01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:09.800
For pale they look withfear, as witnessing

863
01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:10.830
The truth on our side.

864
01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:11.970
No, Plantagenet,

865
01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:14.700
'Tis not for fear butanger that thy cheeks

866
01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.730
Blush for pure shame tocounterfeit our roses,

867
01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:20.500
And yet thy tongue willnot confess thy error.

868
01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.170
Hath not thy rose acanker, Somerset?

869
01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:23.970
Hath not thy rose a thorn,Plantagenet?

870
01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:27.600
Ay, sharp and piercing, tomaintain his truth;

871
01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:33.530
Whiles thy consumingcanker eats his falsehood.

872
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:36.330
Well, I'll find friends towear my bleeding roses,

873
01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:39.730
That shall maintain what Ihave said is true,

874
01:04:39.730 --> 01:04:44.400
Where false Plantagenetdare not be seen.

875
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:47.630
Now, by this maidenblossom in my hand,

876
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:52.470
I scorn thee and thyfashion, peevish boy.

877
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:54.470
Turn not thy scorns thisway, Plantagenet.

878
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:57.670
Proud Pole, I will, andscorn both him and thee.

879
01:04:57.670 --> 01:05:00.400
I'll turn my part thereofinto thy throat.

880
01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.170
Away, away, good Williamde la Pole!

881
01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:05.400
We grace the yeoman byconversing with him.

882
01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.400
Now, by God's will, thouwrong'st him, Somerset;

883
01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.900
His grandfather was LionelDuke of Clarence,

884
01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:14.830
Third son to the thirdEdward King of England:

885
01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:17.630
Spring crestless yeomenfrom so deep a root?

886
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:18.870
He bears him on theplace's privilege,

887
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:20.500
Or durst not, for hiscraven heart, say thus.

888
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.600
By him that made me, I'llmaintain my words

889
01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.600
On any plot of ground inChristendom.

890
01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.800
Was not thy father,Richard Earl of Cambridge,

891
01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.570
For treason 'headed inour late king's days?

892
01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:31.830
And, by his treason,stand'st not thou attainted,

893
01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:35.170
Corrupted, and exempt fromancient gentry?

894
01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:38.000
His trespass yet livesguilty in thy blood;

895
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.500
And, till thou be restored,thou art a yeoman.

896
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.270
My father was attached,not attainted,

897
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:50.830
Condemn'd to die fortreason, but no traitor;

898
01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:52.330
And that I'll prove onbetter men than Somerset,

899
01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:54.900
Were growing time onceripen'd to my will.

900
01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:58.200
For your partaker Pole andyou yourself,

901
01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:01.400
I'll note you in my bookof memory,

902
01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.000
To scourge you for thisapprehension:

903
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.230
Look to it well and sayyou are well warn'd.

904
01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:09.670
Ah, thou shalt find usready for thee still;

905
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:11.970
And know us by thesecolours for thy foes,

906
01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:15.230
For these my friends inspite of thee shall wear.

907
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:20.270
And, by my soul, this paleand angry rose,

908
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:24.200
As cognizance of myblood-drinking hate,

909
01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.800
Will I for ever and myfaction wear,

910
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.600
Until it wither with me tomy grave

911
01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:32.800
Or flourish to the heightof my degree.

912
01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:37.070
Go forward and be chokedwith thy ambition!

913
01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:39.230
And so farewell until Imeet thee next.

914
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:46.570
Have with thee, Pole.Farewell, ambitious Richard.

915
01:06:57.270 --> 01:07:01.570
How I am braved and mustperforce endure it!

916
01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:04.570
This blot that they objectagainst your house

917
01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:06.830
Shall be wiped out in thenext parliament

918
01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:10.200
Call'd for the truce ofWinchester and Gloucester;

919
01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:13.530
And if thou be not thencreated York,

920
01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:17.430
I will not live to beaccounted Warwick.

921
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:20.600
Meantime, in signal of mylove to thee,

922
01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.430
Against proud Somerset andWilliam Pole,

923
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:29.670
Will I upon thy party wearthis rose:

924
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:34.230
And here I prophesy: thisbrawl to-day,

925
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:36.530
Grown to this faction inthe Temple-garden,

926
01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:40.470
Shall send between the redrose and the white

927
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:46.100
A thousand souls to deathand deadly night.

928
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:56.900
Good Master Vernon, I ambound to you,

929
01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:58.830
That you on my behalfwould pluck a flower.

930
01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:01.000
In your behalf still willI wear the same.

931
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.700
And so will I.

932
01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:06.300
Thanks, gentle sir.

933
01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:17.470
Come, let us four todinner: I dare say

934
01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:22.570
This quarrel will drinkblood another day.

935
01:08:36.670 --> 01:08:40.730
Kind keepers of my weakdecaying age,

936
01:08:40.730 --> 01:08:45.470
Let dying Mortimer hererest himself.

937
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:59.230
Even like a man new haledfrom the rack,

938
01:08:59.230 --> 01:09:03.870
So fare my limbs with longimprisonment.

939
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:07.330
And these grey locks, thepursuivants of death,

940
01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:10.630
Nestor-like aged in an ageof care,

941
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:15.070
Argue the end of EdmundMortimer.

942
01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:20.370
But tell me, keeper, willmy nephew come?

943
01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:24.670
Richard Plantagenet, mylord, will come:

944
01:09:24.670 --> 01:09:27.800
We sent unto the Temple,unto his chamber;

945
01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:31.070
And answer was return'dthat he will come.

946
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:38.600
Enough: my soul shall thenbe satisfied.

947
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:45.900
Poor gentleman! his wrongdoth equal mine.

948
01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:50.100
Since Henry Monmouth firstbegan to reign,

949
01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:53.330
Before whose glory I wasgreat in arms,

950
01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:57.700
This loathsomesequestration have I had:

951
01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:01.570
Even so long hasRichard been obscured,

952
01:10:01.570 --> 01:10:05.930
Deprived of honour andinheritance.

953
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:08.330
But now the arbitrator ofdespairs,

954
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:13.500
Just death, kind umpire ofmen's miseries,

955
01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:19.330
With sweet enlargementdoth dismiss me hence:

956
01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:23.970
I would his troubleslikewise were expired,

957
01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:28.870
That so he might recoverwhat was lost.

958
01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:33.730
My lord, your lovingnephew now is come.

959
01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:37.770
Richard Plantagenet, myfriend, is he come?

960
01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:42.830
Ay, noble uncle, thusignobly used,

961
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:46.400
Your nephew, late despisedRichard, comes.

962
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:52.230
Direct mine arms I mayembrace his neck,

963
01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:59.670
And now declare, sweet stemof York's great stock,

964
01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:04.530
Why didst thou say, oflate thou wert despised?

965
01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:11.030
First, lean thine agedback against mine arm;

966
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:15.700
And, in that ease, I'lltell thee my disease.

967
01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:23.200
This day, in argument upona case,

968
01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.170
Some words there grew'twixt Somerset and me;

969
01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:28.200
Among which terms he usedhis lavish tongue

970
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.530
And did upbraid me with myfather's death:

971
01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:33.470
Therefore, good uncle, formy father's sake,

972
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:35.830
In honour of a truePlantagenet

973
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:38.600
And for alliance sake,declare the cause

974
01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.100
My father, Earl ofCambridge, lost his head.

975
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:44.400
That cause, fair nephew,that imprison'd me

976
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.900
And hath detain'd me allmy flowering youth

977
01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:50.370
Within a loathsomedungeon, there to pine,

978
01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:54.030
Was cursed instrument ofhis decease.

979
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:57.970
Discover more at largewhat cause that was,

980
01:11:57.970 --> 01:12:05.200
Henry the Fourth,grandfather to this king,

981
01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.300
Deposed his nephewRichard,

982
01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:09.530
The first-begotten and thelawful heir,

983
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:13.930
Of Edward king, the thirdof that descent:

984
01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:17.570
In Henry's reign thePercies of the north,

985
01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:20.600
Finding his usurpationmost unjust,

986
01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:24.170
Endeavor'd my advancementto the throne:

987
01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:27.600
The reason moved thesewarlike lords to this

988
01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.270
Was, for that--young KingRichard thus removed,

989
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:34.670
Leaving no heir begottenof his body--

990
01:12:34.670 --> 01:12:38.630
I was the next by birthand parentage;

991
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:41.570
For by my mother I derivedam

992
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:45.670
From Lionel Duke ofClarence, the third son

993
01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:47.330
To King Edward the Third;whereas he

994
01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:50.470
From John of Gaunt dothbring his pedigree,

995
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:55.170
Being but fourth of thatheroic line.

996
01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:59.900
But mark: as in thatgreat haughty attempt

997
01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:04.000
They laboured to plantthe rightful heir,

998
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:10.930
I lost my liberty and theytheir lives.

999
01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:14.400
Long after this, whenHenry the Fifth,

1000
01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:18.130
Succeeding his fatherBolingbroke, did reign,

1001
01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:22.430
Thy father, the Earl ofCambridge then, derived

1002
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:25.930
From famous EdmundLangley, Duke of York,

1003
01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:29.870
Marrying my sister thatthy mother was,

1004
01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:32.530
Again in pity of my harddistress

1005
01:13:32.530 --> 01:13:35.000
Levied an army, weening toredeem

1006
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.070
And have install'd me inthe diadem:

1007
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:43.930
But, as the rest, so fellthat noble earl

1008
01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:47.730
And was beheaded. Thus theMortimers,

1009
01:13:47.730 --> 01:13:54.400
In whom the title rested,were suppress'd.

1010
01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.300
Of which, my lord, yourhonour is the last.

1011
01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:00.900
True; and thou seest thatI no issue have

1012
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:09.370
Thou art my heir; the restI wish thee gather:

1013
01:14:09.370 --> 01:14:15.200
My dear, be wary in thystudious care.

1014
01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:19.200
Thy grave admonishmentsprevail with me:

1015
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.970
But yet, methinks, myfather's execution

1016
01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:23.600
Was nothing less thanbloody tyranny.

1017
01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:29.370
With silence, nephew, bethou politic:

1018
01:14:29.370 --> 01:14:33.700
Strong-fixed is the houseof Lancaster,

1019
01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:41.670
And like a mountain, notto be removed.

1020
01:14:41.670 --> 01:14:45.930
But now thy uncle isremoving hence:

1021
01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:50.030
As princes do their courts,when they are cloy'd

1022
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:54.600
With long continuance in asettled place.

1023
01:14:54.600 --> 01:15:00.300
O, uncle, would some partof my young years

1024
01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:02.170
Might but redeem thepassage of your age!

1025
01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:05.700
Thou then dost wrong me,as that slaughterer doth

1026
01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:10.900
Which giveth many woundswhen one will kill.

1027
01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:16.530
Mourn not, except thousorrow for my good;

1028
01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:21.300
Only give order for myfuneral:

1029
01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:27.300
And so farewell, and fairbe all thy hopes

1030
01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:33.900
And prosperous be thy lifein peace and war!

1031
01:15:48.930 --> 01:15:54.600
And peace, no war, befallthy parting soul!

1032
01:16:02.230 --> 01:16:11.530
Well, I will lock hiscounsel in my breast;

1033
01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:18.530
And what I do imagine letthat rest.

1034
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.930
Keepers, convey him hence,and I myself

1035
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:39.330
Will see his burial betterthan his life.

1036
01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:46.370
Here dies the dusky torchof Mortimer,

1037
01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:51.130
Choked with ambition ofthe meaner sort:

1038
01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:54.830
And for those wrongs,those bitter injuries,

1039
01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:57.970
Which Somerset hathoffer'd to my house:

1040
01:16:57.970 --> 01:17:02.230
I doubt not but withhonour to redress;

1041
01:17:02.230 --> 01:17:05.630
And therefore haste I tothe parliament,

1042
01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:09.600
Either to be restored tomy blood,

1043
01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.500
Or make my ill theadvantage of my good.

1044
01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:33.370
Comest thou with deeppremeditated lines,

1045
01:17:33.370 --> 01:17:37.770
With written pamphletsstudiously devised,

1046
01:17:37.770 --> 01:17:41.330
Humphrey of Gloucester? Ifthou canst accuse,

1047
01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:43.230
Or aught intend'st to layunto my charge,

1048
01:17:43.230 --> 01:17:46.500
Do it without invention,suddenly;

1049
01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.630
As I with sudden andextemporal speech

1050
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:52.230
Purpose to answer whatthou canst object.

1051
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:59.070
Presumptuous priest! thisplace commands my patience,

1052
01:17:59.070 --> 01:18:02.470
Or thou shouldst find thouhast dishonour'd me.

1053
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:04.800
Think not, although inwriting I preferr'd

1054
01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.970
The manner of thy vileoutrageous crimes,

1055
01:18:06.970 --> 01:18:09.470
That therefore I haveforged, or am not able

1056
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:13.800
Verbatim to rehearse themethod of my pen:

1057
01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:17.970
No, prelate; such is thyaudacious wickedness,

1058
01:18:17.970 --> 01:18:20.770
Thy lewd, pestiferous anddissentious pranks,

1059
01:18:20.770 --> 01:18:23.200
As very infants prattle ofthy pride.

1060
01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.700
Thou art a most pernicioususurer,

1061
01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:29.330
Forward by nature, enemyto peace;

1062
01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:31.600
Lascivious, wanton, morethan well beseems

1063
01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:34.430
A man of thy professionand degree;

1064
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:37.230
And for thy treachery,what's more manifest?

1065
01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:40.800
In that thou laid'st atrap to take my life,

1066
01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.200
As well at London bridgeas at the Tower.

1067
01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:46.370
Beside, I fear me, if thythoughts were sifted,

1068
01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:50.000
The king, thy sovereign,is not quite exempt

1069
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.530
From envious malice of thyswelling heart.

1070
01:18:52.530 --> 01:18:57.500
Gloucester, I do defythee. Lords, vouchsafe

1071
01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:00.830
To give me hearing what Ishall reply.

1072
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:09.200
If covetous,ambitious or perverse,

1073
01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:14.700
As he will have me, how amI so poor?

1074
01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:16.970
Or how haps it I seek notto advance

1075
01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:20.770
Or raise myself, but keepmy wonted calling?

1076
01:19:20.770 --> 01:19:24.330
And for dissension, whopreferreth peace

1077
01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:28.370
More than I do?--except Ibe provoked.

1078
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:32.470
No, my good lords, it isnot that offends;

1079
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:36.300
It is not that that hathincensed the duke:

1080
01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:39.970
It is, because no oneshould sway but he;

1081
01:19:39.970 --> 01:19:42.900
No one but he should beabout the king;

1082
01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:44.970
And that engenders thunderin his breast

1083
01:19:44.970 --> 01:19:49.670
And makes him roar theseaccusations forth.

1084
01:19:49.670 --> 01:19:52.100
But he shall know I am asgood--

1085
01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:53.270
As good!

1086
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:57.670
Thou bastard of mygrandfather!

1087
01:19:57.670 --> 01:20:01.630
Ay, lordly sir; and whatare you, I pray,

1088
01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:05.430
But one imperious inanother's throne?

1089
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:07.500
Am I not protector, saucypriest?

1090
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:09.530
And am not I a prelate ofthe church?

1091
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:11.600
Yes, as an outlaw in acastle keeps

1092
01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.370
And useth it to patronagehis theft.

1093
01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:14.830
Unreverent Gloster!

1094
01:20:14.830 --> 01:20:16.270
Thou art reverent

1095
01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:20.400
Touching thy spiritualfunction, not thy life.

1096
01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:22.270
Rome shall remedy this.

1097
01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:25.500
Roam thither, then.

1098
01:20:30.730 --> 01:20:32.270
My lord, it were your dutyto forbear.

1099
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:34.800
Methinks my lord should bereligious

1100
01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.770
And know the office thatbelongs to such.

1101
01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:38.530
Methinks his lordshipshould be humbler;

1102
01:20:38.530 --> 01:20:39.970
it fitteth not a prelateso to plead.

1103
01:20:39.970 --> 01:20:42.630
Yes, when his holy stateis touch'd so near.

1104
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:44.270
State holy or unhallow'd,what of that?

1105
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:48.330
Is not his grace protectorto the king?

1106
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.730
Plantagenet, I see, musthold his tongue,

1107
01:20:52.730 --> 01:20:56.200
Lest it be said 'Speak,sirrah, when you should;

1108
01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:59.930
Must your bold verdictenter talk with lords?'

1109
01:20:59.930 --> 01:21:03.370
Else would I have a flingat Winchester.

1110
01:21:03.370 --> 01:21:07.070
Uncles of Gloucester andof Winchester,

1111
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:10.930
The special watchmen ofour English weal,

1112
01:21:10.930 --> 01:21:14.270
I would prevail, ifprayers might prevail,

1113
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:20.870
To join your hearts inlove and amity.

1114
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:22.600
O, what a scandal is it toour crown,

1115
01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:25.500
That two such noble peersas ye should jar!

1116
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.800
Believe me, lords, mytender years can tell

1117
01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.100
Civil dissension is aviperous worm

1118
01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:33.230
That gnaws the bowels ofthe commonwealth.

1119
01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:37.100
What tumult's this?

1120
01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:38.070
An uproar, I dare warrant,

1121
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:40.570
Begun through malice ofthe bishop's men.

1122
01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.700
O, my good lords, andvirtuous Henry,

1123
01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:49.530
Pity the city of London,pity us!

1124
01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:51.300
The bishop and the Duke ofGloucester's men,

1125
01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:53.300
Forbidden late to carryany weapon,

1126
01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:56.430
Have fill'd their pocketsfull of pebble stones

1127
01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:58.630
And banding themselves incontrary parts

1128
01:21:58.630 --> 01:22:01.200
Do pelt so fast at oneanother's pate

1129
01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:03.600
That many have their giddybrains knock'd out:

1130
01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:06.370
Our windows are broke downin every street

1131
01:22:06.370 --> 01:22:10.130
And we for fear compell'dto shut our shops.

1132
01:22:19.670 --> 01:22:21.400
We charge you, onallegiance to ourself,

1133
01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.070
To hold your slaughteringhands and keep the peace.

1134
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:26.200
Pray, uncle Gloucester,mitigate this strife.

1135
01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:27.670
First Serving-man: Nay, ifwe be forbidden stones,

1136
01:22:27.670 --> 01:22:29.500
We'll fall to it with ourteeth.

1137
01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:32.430
Second Serving-man: Do whatye dare, we are as resolute.

1138
01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:36.170
You of my household, leavethis peevish broil

1139
01:22:36.170 --> 01:22:39.730
And set this unaccustom'dfight aside.

1140
01:22:39.730 --> 01:22:41.470
Third Serving-man: My lord, weknow your grace to be a man

1141
01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:43.830
Just and upright; and, foryour royal birth,

1142
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:46.600
Inferior to none but tohis majesty:

1143
01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:48.430
And ere that we willsuffer such a prince,

1144
01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:50.730
So kind a father of thecommonweal,

1145
01:22:50.730 --> 01:22:53.030
To be disgraced by aninkhorn mate,

1146
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:55.330
We and our wives andchildren all will fight

1147
01:22:55.330 --> 01:22:57.530
And have our bodiesslaughtered by thy foes.

1148
01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:59.500
First Serving-man: Ay, andthe very parings of our nails

1149
01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:02.330
Shall pitch a field whenwe are dead.

1150
01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:04.670
Stay, stay, I say!

1151
01:23:04.670 --> 01:23:08.600
And if you love me, as yousay you do,

1152
01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:12.470
Let me persuade you toforbear awhile.

1153
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:27.170
O, how this discord dothafflict my soul!

1154
01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.330
Can you, my Lord ofWinchester, behold

1155
01:23:30.330 --> 01:23:34.770
My sighs and tears andwill not once relent?

1156
01:23:34.770 --> 01:23:37.370
Who should be pitiful, ifyou be not?

1157
01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:38.870
Or who should study toprefer a peace.

1158
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:43.430
If holy churchmen takedelight in broils?

1159
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:48.600
My lord protector, yield;yield, Winchester;

1160
01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.600
Except you mean withobstinate repulse

1161
01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:53.030
To slay your sovereign anddestroy the realm.

1162
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:57.930
He shall submit, or Iwill never yield.

1163
01:23:59.930 --> 01:24:03.270
Compassion on the kingcommands me stoop;

1164
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:05.400
Or I would see his heartout, ere the priest

1165
01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:08.230
Should ever get thatprivilege of me.

1166
01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:09.430
Behold, my Lord ofWinchester, the duke

1167
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:11.870
Hath banish'd moodydiscontented fury,

1168
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:15.270
As by his smoothed browsit doth appear:

1169
01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:19.470
Why look you still sostern and tragical?

1170
01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:24.770
Here, Winchester, I offerthee my hand.

1171
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:28.930
Fie, uncle Beaufort! Ihave heard you preach

1172
01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:31.400
That malice was a greatand grievous sin;

1173
01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.000
And will not you maintainthe thing you teach,

1174
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.900
But prove a chief offenderin the same?

1175
01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:38.500
For shame, my lord ofWinchester, relent!

1176
01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:43.800
What, shall a childinstruct you what to do?

1177
01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:50.870
Well, Duke of Gloucester,I will yield to thee;

1178
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:57.170
Love for thy love and handfor hand I give.

1179
01:24:57.970 --> 01:25:02.070
Ay, but, I fear me, with ahollow heart.--

1180
01:25:03.570 --> 01:25:10.030
See here, my loving friends andcountrymen,

1181
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:13.730
This token serveth for aflag of truce

1182
01:25:13.730 --> 01:25:16.830
Betwixt ourselves and allour followers:

1183
01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:20.070
So help me God, as Idissemble not!

1184
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:24.470
So help me God, as Iintend it not!

1185
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:27.070
O, loving uncle, kind Dukeof Gloucester,

1186
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:29.500
How joyful am I made bythis contract!

1187
01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.630
Away, my masters! troubleus no more;

1188
01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:34.300
But join in friendship, asyour lords have done.

1189
01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:39.670
First Serving-man: Content:I'll to the surgeon's.

1190
01:25:39.670 --> 01:25:40.870
Second Serving-man: And sowill I.

1191
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:44.630
Third-man: And I will see whatphysic the tavern affords.

1192
01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:51.370
Accept this scroll, mostgracious sovereign,

1193
01:25:51.370 --> 01:25:52.800
Which in the right ofRichard Plantagenet

1194
01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:55.000
We do exhibit to yourmajesty.

1195
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.070
Well urged, my Lord ofWarwick: or sweet prince,

1196
01:25:59.070 --> 01:26:02.130
And if your grace markevery circumstance,

1197
01:26:02.130 --> 01:26:04.570
You have great reason todo Richard right;

1198
01:26:04.570 --> 01:26:05.870
Especially for thoseoccasions

1199
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:08.400
At Eltham Place I toldyour majesty.

1200
01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:11.000
And those occasions,uncle, were of force:

1201
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.930
Therefore, my lovinglords, our pleasure is

1202
01:26:12.930 --> 01:26:16.700
That Richard be restoredto his blood.

1203
01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:19.230
Let Richard be restored tohis blood;

1204
01:26:19.230 --> 01:26:21.970
So shall his father'swrongs be recompensed.

1205
01:26:21.970 --> 01:26:28.670
As will the rest, sowilleth Winchester.

1206
01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:31.400
If Richard will be true,not that alone

1207
01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.230
But all the wholeinheritance I give

1208
01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:34.700
That doth belong unto thehouse of York,

1209
01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:37.730
From whence you spring bylineal descent.

1210
01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:41.970
Thy humble servant vowsobedience

1211
01:26:41.970 --> 01:26:45.100
And humble service tillthe point of death.

1212
01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.730
Stoop then and set yourknee against my foot;

1213
01:26:50.730 --> 01:26:52.930
And, in reguerdon of thatduty done,

1214
01:26:52.930 --> 01:26:57.130
I gird thee with thevaliant sword of York:

1215
01:26:57.130 --> 01:26:59.570
Rise Richard, like a truePlantagenet,

1216
01:26:59.570 --> 01:27:06.170
And rise created princelyDuke of York.

1217
01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:10.770
And so thrive Richard asthy foes may fall!

1218
01:27:10.770 --> 01:27:13.200
And as my duty springs, soperish they

1219
01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:16.770
That grudge one thoughtagainst your majesty!

1220
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:22.570
Welcome, high prince, themighty Duke of York!

1221
01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:27.470
Perish, base prince,ignoble Duke of York!

1222
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:29.370
Now will it best availyour majesty

1223
01:27:29.370 --> 01:27:32.730
To cross the seas and tobe crown'd in France:

1224
01:27:32.730 --> 01:27:35.170
The presence of a kingengenders love

1225
01:27:35.170 --> 01:27:37.930
Amongst his subjects andhis loyal friends,

1226
01:27:37.930 --> 01:27:40.700
As it disanimates hisenemies.

1227
01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:43.600
When Gloucester says theword, King Henry goes;

1228
01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:46.270
For friendly counsel cutsoff many foes.

1229
01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:51.100
Your ships already are inreadiness.

1230
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:13.900
Ay, we may march inEngland or in France,

1231
01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:16.570
Not seeing what is likelyto ensue.

1232
01:28:16.570 --> 01:28:18.830
This late dissension grownbetwixt the peers

1233
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:22.130
Burns under feigned ashesof forged love

1234
01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:25.230
And will at last break outinto a flame:

1235
01:28:25.230 --> 01:28:28.500
As fester'd members rotbut by degree,

1236
01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:32.330
Till bones and flesh andsinews fall away,

1237
01:28:32.330 --> 01:28:37.230
So will this base andenvious discord breed.

1238
01:28:37.230 --> 01:28:40.530
And now I fear that fatalprophecy

1239
01:28:40.530 --> 01:28:42.700
Which in the time of Henrynamed the Fifth

1240
01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:45.530
Was in the mouth of everysucking babe;

1241
01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:49.470
That Henry born atMonmouth should win all

1242
01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:54.570
And Henry born at Windsorlose all:

1243
01:28:54.570 --> 01:28:56.530
Which is so plain thatExeter doth wish

1244
01:28:56.530 --> 01:29:01.470
His days may finish erethat hapless time.

1245
01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:33.530
These are the city gates,the gates of Rouen,

1246
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:38.100
Through which our policymust make a breach:

1247
01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:43.330
Take heed, be wary how youplace your words;

1248
01:29:43.330 --> 01:29:45.330
Talk like the vulgar sortof market men

1249
01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:48.930
That come to gather moneyfor their corn.

1250
01:29:48.930 --> 01:29:52.100
If we have entrance, as Ihope we shall,

1251
01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:55.670
And that we find theslothful watch but weak,

1252
01:29:55.670 --> 01:29:58.100
I'll by a sign give noticeto our friends,

1253
01:29:58.100 --> 01:30:01.200
That Charles the Dauphinmay encounter them.

1254
01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:06.500
Our sacks shall be a meanto sack the city,

1255
01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:11.070
And we be lords and rulersover Rouen;

1256
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.800
Therefore we'll knock.

1257
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:24.300
Qui est la?

1258
01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:27.230
Paysans, pauvres gens deFrance;

1259
01:30:27.230 --> 01:30:31.370
Poor market folks thatcome to sell their corn.

1260
01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:37.370
Enter, go in; the marketbell is rung.

1261
01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:44.030
Now, Rouen, I'll shake thybulwarks to the ground.

1262
01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:48.030
Saint Denis bless thishappy stratagem!

1263
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:50.500
And once again we'll sleepsecure in Rouen.

1264
01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:52.670
Now she is there, how willshe specify

1265
01:30:52.670 --> 01:30:55.170
Where is the best andsafest passage in?

1266
01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:58.070
By thrusting out a torchfrom yonder tower;

1267
01:30:58.070 --> 01:31:00.170
Which, once discern'd,shows that her meaning is,

1268
01:31:00.170 --> 01:31:02.730
No way to that, forweakness, which she enter'd.

1269
01:31:02.730 --> 01:31:05.670
Behold, this is the happywedding torch

1270
01:31:05.670 --> 01:31:08.700
That joineth Rouen untoher countrymen,

1271
01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:12.330
But burning fatal to theTalbotites!

1272
01:31:12.330 --> 01:31:14.270
Defer no time, delays havedangerous ends;

1273
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:16.700
Enter, and cry 'TheDauphin!' presently,

1274
01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:19.600
And then do execution onthe watch.

1275
01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:38.400
France, thou shalt rue thistreason with thy tears,

1276
01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:41.200
If Talbot but survive thytreachery.

1277
01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:43.470
Pucelle, that witch, thatdamned sorceress,

1278
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:45.700
Hath wrought this hellishmischief unawares,

1279
01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:49.500
That hardly we escaped thepride of France.

1280
01:32:58.470 --> 01:33:07.970
Good morrow, gallants!want ye corn for bread?

1281
01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:09.970
I think the Duke ofBurgundy will fast

1282
01:33:09.970 --> 01:33:13.370
Before he'll buy again atsuch a rate:

1283
01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:17.630
Scoff on, vile fiend andshameless courtezan!

1284
01:33:17.630 --> 01:33:20.370
I trust ere long to chokethee with thine own

1285
01:33:20.370 --> 01:33:23.870
And make thee curse theharvest of that corn.

1286
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:26.900
Your grace may starveperhaps before that time.

1287
01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:31.500
O, let no words, but deeds,revenge this treason!

1288
01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:34.830
What will you do, goodgrey-beard? break a lance,

1289
01:33:34.830 --> 01:33:37.530
And run a tilt at deathwithin a chair?

1290
01:33:37.530 --> 01:33:40.700
Foul fiend of France, andhag of all despite,

1291
01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:43.400
Encompass'd with thylustful paramours!

1292
01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:46.170
Becomes it thee to taunthis valiant age

1293
01:33:46.170 --> 01:33:48.930
And twit with cowardice aman half dead?

1294
01:33:48.930 --> 01:33:50.800
Damsel, I'll have a boutwith you again,

1295
01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:53.100
Or else let Talbot perishwith this shame.

1296
01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:58.100
Are ye so hot? yet,Pucelle, hold thy peace;

1297
01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:02.770
If Talbot do but thunder,rain will follow.

1298
01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:10.670
The English whispertogether in council

1299
01:34:10.670 --> 01:34:15.870
God speed the parliament!who shall be the speaker?

1300
01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:26.800
Dare ye come forth andmeet us in the field?

1301
01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:30.300
Belike your lordship takesus then for fools,

1302
01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:33.700
To try if that our own beours or no.

1303
01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:36.130
I speak not to thatrailing Hecate,

1304
01:34:36.130 --> 01:34:38.470
But unto thee, Alencon,and the rest;

1305
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:43.000
Will ye, like soldiers,come and fight it out?

1306
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.530
Signior, no.

1307
01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:53.670
Signior, hang! basemuleters of France!

1308
01:34:53.670 --> 01:34:56.200
Like peasant foot-boys dothey keep the walls

1309
01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:59.270
And dare not take up armslike gentlemen.

1310
01:34:59.270 --> 01:35:01.370
Away, captains! let's getus from the walls;

1311
01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:04.400
For Talbot means nogoodness by his looks.

1312
01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:06.830
God bye my lord!we came but to tell you

1313
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:08.430
That we are here.

1314
01:35:08.430 --> 01:35:11.530
And there will we be too,ere it be long,

1315
01:35:11.530 --> 01:35:15.830
Or else reproach beTalbot's greatest fame!

1316
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:18.500
Vow, Burgundy, by honourof thy house,

1317
01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:21.470
Prick'd on by public wrongssustain'd in France,

1318
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:25.600
Either to get the townagain or die:

1319
01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:28.430
And I, as sure as EnglishHenry lives

1320
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:31.430
And as his father here wasconqueror,

1321
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:33.700
As sure as in thislate-betrayed town

1322
01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:37.200
Great Coeur-de-lion'sheart was buried,

1323
01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:41.470
So sure I swear to get thetown or die.

1324
01:35:41.470 --> 01:35:49.230
My vows are equal partnerswith thy vows.

1325
01:35:49.230 --> 01:35:52.730
But, ere we go, regardthis dying prince,

1326
01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:56.000
The valiant Duke ofBedford. Come, my lord,

1327
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.300
We will bestow you in somebetter place,

1328
01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:00.800
Fitter for sickness andfor crazy age.

1329
01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:03.730
Lord Talbot, do not sodishonour me:

1330
01:36:03.730 --> 01:36:06.800
Here will I sit before thewalls of Rouen

1331
01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:09.230
And will be partner ofyour weal or woe.

1332
01:36:09.230 --> 01:36:12.670
Courageous Bedford, let usnow persuade you.

1333
01:36:12.670 --> 01:36:15.930
Not to be gone from hence;for once I read

1334
01:36:15.930 --> 01:36:18.900
That stout Pendragon inhis litter sick

1335
01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:21.670
Came to the field andvanquished his foes:

1336
01:36:21.670 --> 01:36:25.970
Methinks I should revivethe soldiers' hearts,

1337
01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:29.900
Because I ever found themas myself.

1338
01:36:30.230 --> 01:36:34.600
Undaunted spirit in adying breast!

1339
01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:41.000
Then be it so: heavenskeep old Bedford safe!

1340
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.700
And now no more ado, braveBurgundy,

1341
01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:48.970
But gather we our forcesout of hand

1342
01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:55.070
And set upon our boastingenemy.

1343
01:36:57.700 --> 01:36:59.970
Whither away, Sir JohnFastolfe, in such haste?

1344
01:36:59.970 --> 01:37:03.130
Whither away! to savemyself by flight:

1345
01:37:03.130 --> 01:37:04.970
We are like to have theoverthrow again.

1346
01:37:04.970 --> 01:37:07.030
What! will you fly, andleave Lord Talbot?

1347
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:08.030
Ay,

1348
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:10.400
All the Talbots in theworld, to save my life!

1349
01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:15.600
Cowardly knight! illfortune follow thee!

1350
01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:33.330
Now, quiet soul, departwhen heaven please,

1351
01:37:33.330 --> 01:37:36.970
For I have seen ourenemies' overthrow.

1352
01:37:36.970 --> 01:37:41.500
What is the trust orstrength of foolish man?

1353
01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:43.800
They that of late weredaring with their scoffs

1354
01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:52.630
Are glad and fain byflight to save themselves.

1355
01:38:07.170 --> 01:38:09.700
Lost, and recover'd in aday again!

1356
01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:11.900
This is a double honour,Burgundy:

1357
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:15.470
Yet heavens have glory forthis victory!

1358
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:18.470
Warlike and martialTalbot, Burgundy

1359
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:21.230
Enshrines thee in hisheart and there erects

1360
01:38:21.230 --> 01:38:24.330
Thy noble deeds asvalour's monuments.

1361
01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:34.370
The noble Duke of Bedfordis deceased,

1362
01:38:48.570 --> 01:38:51.870
A braver soldier nevercouched lance,

1363
01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:56.470
A gentler heart did neversway in court;

1364
01:38:56.470 --> 01:39:01.030
But kings and mightiestpotentates must die,

1365
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:06.370
For that's the end ofhuman misery.

1366
01:39:06.370 --> 01:39:14.100
Thou see'ist his exucustperformed in Rouen.

1367
01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:17.700
Then we will take some order inthis town.

1368
01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:25.400
Placing therein some expertoffices

1369
01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:28.970
and then depart to Paris tothe King

1370
01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:32.970
For there young Henryand his nobles lie.

1371
01:39:32.970 --> 01:39:38.970
What wills Lord Talbot,pleaseth Burgandy.

1372
01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:09.630
Dismay not, princes, atthis accident,

1373
01:40:09.630 --> 01:40:14.330
Nor grieve that Rouen isso recovered:

1374
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:17.600
Care is no cure, butrather corrosive,

1375
01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:21.170
For things that are not tobe remedied.

1376
01:40:21.170 --> 01:40:24.400
Let frantic Talbot triumphfor a while

1377
01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:28.730
And like a peacock sweepalong his tail;

1378
01:40:28.730 --> 01:40:30.570
We'll pull his plumes andtake away his train,

1379
01:40:30.570 --> 01:40:33.770
If Dauphin and the restwill be but ruled.

1380
01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:35.370
We have been guided bythee hitherto,

1381
01:40:35.370 --> 01:40:37.570
And of thy cunning had nodiffidence:

1382
01:40:37.570 --> 01:40:40.430
One sudden foil shallnever breed distrust.

1383
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:44.770
Then thus it must be; thisdoth Joan devise:

1384
01:40:44.770 --> 01:40:49.730
By fair persuasions mix'dwith sugar'd words

1385
01:40:49.730 --> 01:40:52.030
We will entice the Duke ofBurgundy

1386
01:40:52.030 --> 01:40:55.130
To leave the Talbot and tofollow us.

1387
01:40:55.130 --> 01:40:57.430
Ay, marry, sweeting, if wecould do that,

1388
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:59.770
France were no place forHenry's warriors;

1389
01:40:59.770 --> 01:41:01.700
Nor should that nationboast it so with us,

1390
01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:03.200
But be extirped from ourprovinces.

1391
01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:05.470
For ever should they beexpulsed from France

1392
01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:08.430
And not have title of anearldom here.

1393
01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:10.530
Your honours shallperceive how I will work

1394
01:41:10.530 --> 01:41:13.630
To bring this matter tothe wished end.

1395
01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:17.500
Hark! by the sound of drumyou may perceive

1396
01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:21.670
Their powers are marchingunto Paris-ward.

1397
01:41:21.670 --> 01:41:24.430
There goes the Talbot,with his colours spread,

1398
01:41:24.430 --> 01:41:28.970
And all the troops ofEnglish after him.

1399
01:41:28.970 --> 01:41:32.630
Now in the rearward comesthe duke and his:

1400
01:41:32.630 --> 01:41:34.900
Fortune in favour makeshim lag behind.

1401
01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:37.970
Summon a parley; we willtalk with him.

1402
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:40.970
A parley with the Duke ofBurgundy!

1403
01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:47.200
Who craves a parley withthe Burgundy?

1404
01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:52.170
The princely Charles ofFrance, thy countryman.

1405
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:57.100
What say'st thou, Charles?for I am marching hence.

1406
01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:59.470
Speak, Pucelle, and enchanthim with thy words.

1407
01:41:59.470 --> 01:42:03.870
Brave Burgundy, undoubtedhope of France!

1408
01:42:03.870 --> 01:42:09.370
Stay, let thy humblehandmaid speak to thee.

1409
01:42:09.370 --> 01:42:13.470
Speak on; but be notover-tedious.

1410
01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:20.530
Look on thy country, lookon fertile France,

1411
01:42:20.530 --> 01:42:24.730
And see the cities and thetowns defaced

1412
01:42:24.730 --> 01:42:28.070
By wasting ruin of thecruel foe.

1413
01:42:28.070 --> 01:42:31.230
As looks the mother on herlowly babe

1414
01:42:31.230 --> 01:42:35.370
When death doth close histender dying eyes,

1415
01:42:35.370 --> 01:42:42.270
See, see the pining maladyof France;

1416
01:42:42.270 --> 01:42:47.770
Behold the wounds, themost unnatural wounds,

1417
01:42:47.770 --> 01:42:51.970
Which thou thyself hastgiven her woful breast.

1418
01:42:51.970 --> 01:42:55.430
O, turn thy edged swordanother way;

1419
01:42:55.430 --> 01:43:01.630
Strike those that hurt, andhurt not those that help.

1420
01:43:01.630 --> 01:43:04.770
One drop of blood drawnfrom thy country's bosom

1421
01:43:04.770 --> 01:43:09.670
Should grieve thee more thanstreams of foreign gore:

1422
01:43:09.670 --> 01:43:13.900
Return thee therefore witha flood of tears,

1423
01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:19.230
And wash away thycountry's stained spots.

1424
01:43:19.230 --> 01:43:22.670
Either she hath bewitch'dme with her words,

1425
01:43:22.670 --> 01:43:26.100
Or nature makes mesuddenly relent.

1426
01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:28.530
Besides, all French andFrance exclaims on thee,

1427
01:43:28.530 --> 01:43:32.100
Doubting thy birth andlawful progeny.

1428
01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:34.370
Who joint'st thou with butwith a lordly nation

1429
01:43:34.370 --> 01:43:38.030
That will not trust theebut for profit's sake?

1430
01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:41.130
When Talbot hath setfooting once in France

1431
01:43:41.130 --> 01:43:43.800
And fashion'd thee thatinstrument of ill,

1432
01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:46.170
Who then but English Henrywill be lord

1433
01:43:46.170 --> 01:43:49.970
And thou be thrust outlike a fugitive?

1434
01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:55.070
See, then, thou fight'stagainst thy countrymen

1435
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:59.300
And joint'st with themwill be thy slaughtermen.

1436
01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:05.830
Come, come, return; return,thou wandering lord:

1437
01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:11.630
Charles and the rest willtake thee in their arms.

1438
01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:22.300
I am vanquished; thesehaughty words of hers

1439
01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:25.930
Have batter'd me likeroaring cannon-shot,

1440
01:44:25.930 --> 01:44:32.970
And made me almost yieldupon my knees.

1441
01:44:32.970 --> 01:44:37.930
Forgive me, country, andsweet countrymen,

1442
01:44:37.930 --> 01:44:43.770
And, lords, accept thishearty kind embrace:

1443
01:44:43.770 --> 01:44:49.770
My forces and my power ofmen are yours:

1444
01:44:49.770 --> 01:44:53.370
So farewell, Talbot; I'llno longer trust thee.

1445
01:44:53.370 --> 01:44:58.370
Done like a Frenchman:turn, and turn again!

1446
01:44:58.370 --> 01:45:00.730
Welcome, brave duke! thyfriendship makes us fresh.

1447
01:45:00.730 --> 01:45:03.030
And doth beget new couragein our breasts.

1448
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:07.500
Pucelle hath bravelyplay'd her part in this,

1449
01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:13.070
And doth deserve a coronetof gold.

1450
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:15.170
Now let us on, my lords,and join our powers,

1451
01:45:15.170 --> 01:45:18.900
And seek how we mayprejudice the foe.

1452
01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:46.630
My gracious prince, andhonourable peers,

1453
01:45:46.630 --> 01:45:48.400
Hearing of your arrival inthis realm,

1454
01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:51.330
I have awhile given truceunto my wars,

1455
01:45:51.330 --> 01:45:54.000
To do my duty to mysovereign:

1456
01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.700
In sign, whereof, thisarm, that hath reclaim'd

1457
01:45:56.700 --> 01:45:58.970
Through your obedience fiftyfortresses,

1458
01:45:58.970 --> 01:46:02.400
Twelve cities and sevenwalled towns of strength,

1459
01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:04.770
Beside five hundredprisoners of esteem,

1460
01:46:04.770 --> 01:46:08.200
Lets fall his sword beforeyour highness' feet,

1461
01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:09.930
And with submissiveloyalty of heart

1462
01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:13.330
Ascribes the glory of hisconquest got

1463
01:46:13.330 --> 01:46:17.330
First to my God and nextunto your grace.

1464
01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:20.600
Is this the Talbot,uncle Gloucester,

1465
01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:22.130
That hath so long beenresident in France?

1466
01:46:22.130 --> 01:46:26.400
Yes, if it please yourmajesty, my liege.

1467
01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:30.600
Welcome, brave captain andvictorious lord!

1468
01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:33.270
When I was young, as yet Iam not old,

1469
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:34.830
I do remember how myfather said

1470
01:46:34.830 --> 01:46:38.300
A stouter champion neverhandled sword.

1471
01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:41.430
Long since we wereresolved of your truth,

1472
01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:43.700
Your faithful service andyour toil in war;

1473
01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:45.700
Yet never have you tastedour reward,

1474
01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:48.030
Or been reguerdon'd withso much as thanks,

1475
01:46:48.030 --> 01:46:50.630
Because till now we neversaw your face:

1476
01:46:50.630 --> 01:46:55.630
Therefore, stand up; and,for these good deserts,

1477
01:46:55.630 --> 01:46:59.270
We here create you Earl ofShrewsbury;

1478
01:46:59.270 --> 01:47:02.430
And in our coronation takeyour place.

1479
01:47:25.770 --> 01:47:30.600
Now, sir, to you, thatwere so hot at sea,

1480
01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:32.430
Disgracing of thesecolours that I wear

1481
01:47:32.430 --> 01:47:34.700
In honour of my noble Lordof York:

1482
01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:38.100
Darest thou maintain theformer words thou spakest?

1483
01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:41.100
Yes, sir; as well as youdare patronage

1484
01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:43.600
The envious barking ofyour saucy tongue

1485
01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:46.530
Against my lord the Dukeof Somerset.

1486
01:47:46.530 --> 01:47:49.870
Sirrah, thy lord I honouras he is.

1487
01:47:49.870 --> 01:47:53.070
Why, what is he? as good aman as York.

1488
01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:59.430
Hark ye; not so: inwitness, take ye that.

1489
01:47:59.430 --> 01:48:02.400
Villain, thou know'st thelaw of arms is such

1490
01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:05.200
That whoso draws a sword,'tis present death,

1491
01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:10.800
Or else this blow shouldbroach thy dearest blood.

1492
01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:13.330
But I'll unto his majesty,and crave

1493
01:48:13.330 --> 01:48:16.370
I may have liberty tovenge this wrong;

1494
01:48:16.370 --> 01:48:21.470
When thou shalt see I'llmeet thee to thy cost.

1495
01:48:22.670 --> 01:48:26.700
Well, miscreant, I'll bethere as soon as you;

1496
01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:30.230
And, after, meet yousooner than you would.

1497
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:46.770
Lord bishop, set the crownupon his head.

1498
01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:11.230
God save King Henry, ofthat name the sixth!

1499
01:49:13.670 --> 01:49:19.070
Crowd: God save King Henry, ofthat name the sixth!

1500
01:49:22.730 --> 01:49:29.270
Now, governor of Paris,take your oath,

1501
01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:49.130
That you elect no otherking but him;

1502
01:49:49.130 --> 01:49:52.730
Esteem none friends butsuch as are his friends,

1503
01:49:52.730 --> 01:49:57.070
And none your foes butsuch as shall pretend

1504
01:49:57.070 --> 01:50:00.630
Malicious practisesagainst his state:

1505
01:50:00.630 --> 01:50:04.770
This shall ye do, so helpyou righteous God!

1506
01:50:04.770 --> 01:50:09.430
This shall I do, so helpme righteous God!

1507
01:50:21.930 --> 01:50:25.700
My gracious sovereign, asI rode from Calais,

1508
01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:27.900
To haste unto yourcoronation,

1509
01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:30.130
A letter was deliver'd tomy hands,

1510
01:50:30.130 --> 01:50:34.100
Writ to your grace fromthe Duke of Burgundy.

1511
01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:39.570
Shame to the Duke ofBurgundy and thee!

1512
01:50:39.570 --> 01:50:42.170
I vow'd, base knight, whenI did meet thee next,

1513
01:50:42.170 --> 01:50:47.400
To tear the garter fromthy craven's leg,

1514
01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:50.000
Which I have done, becauseunworthily

1515
01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.870
Thou wast installed inthat high degree.

1516
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:59.800
Pardon me, princely Henry,and the rest

1517
01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:02.030
This dastard, at thebattle of Patay,

1518
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:04.600
When but in all I was sixthousand strong

1519
01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:07.430
And that the French werealmost ten to one,

1520
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:10.530
Before we met or that astroke was given,

1521
01:51:10.530 --> 01:51:14.600
Like to a trusty squiredid run away:

1522
01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:19.600
In which assault we losttwelve hundred men;

1523
01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:21.830
Myself and diversgentlemen beside

1524
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:25.530
Were there surprised andtaken prisoners.

1525
01:51:25.530 --> 01:51:28.730
Then judge, great lords,if I have done amiss;

1526
01:51:28.730 --> 01:51:31.070
Or whether that suchcowards ought to wear

1527
01:51:31.070 --> 01:51:34.000
This ornament ofknighthood, yea or no.

1528
01:51:37.630 --> 01:51:40.830
To say the truth, thisfact was infamous

1529
01:51:40.830 --> 01:51:44.330
And ill beseeming anycommon man,

1530
01:51:44.330 --> 01:51:49.800
Much more a knight, acaptain and a leader.

1531
01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:56.870
When first this order wasordain'd, my lords,

1532
01:51:56.870 --> 01:52:00.700
Knights of the garter wereof noble birth,

1533
01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:04.630
Valiant and virtuous, fullof haughty courage,

1534
01:52:04.630 --> 01:52:09.100
Such as were grown tocredit by the wars;

1535
01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:11.430
Not fearing death, norshrinking for distress,

1536
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:16.870
But always resolute inmost extremes.

1537
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:19.900
He then that is notfurnish'd in this sort

1538
01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:22.630
Doth but usurp the sacredname of knight,

1539
01:52:22.630 --> 01:52:25.230
Profaning this mosthonourable order,

1540
01:52:25.230 --> 01:52:27.230
And should, if I wereworthy to be judge,

1541
01:52:27.230 --> 01:52:31.000
Be quite degraded, like ahedge-born swain

1542
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.570
That doth presume to boastof gentle blood.

1543
01:52:36.270 --> 01:52:41.570
Stain to thy countrymen,thou hear'st thy doom!

1544
01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:43.470
Be packing, therefore,thou that wast a knight:

1545
01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:46.770
Henceforth we banish thee,on pain of death.

1546
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:55.070
And now, my lordprotector, view the letter

1547
01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:59.270
Sent from our uncle Dukeof Burgundy.

1548
01:53:01.230 --> 01:53:05.600
What means his grace, thathe hath changed his style?

1549
01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:08.000
No more but, plain andbluntly, 'To the king!'

1550
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.500
Hath he forgot he is hissovereign?

1551
01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:16.170
Or doth this churlishsuperscription

1552
01:53:16.170 --> 01:53:18.400
Pretend some alteration ingood will?

1553
01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:24.530
What's here?

1554
01:53:24.530 --> 01:53:28.170
'I have, upon especialcause,

1555
01:53:28.170 --> 01:53:31.630
Moved with compassion ofmy country's wreck,

1556
01:53:31.630 --> 01:53:33.270
Together with the pitifulcomplaints

1557
01:53:33.270 --> 01:53:36.430
Of such as your oppressionfeeds upon,

1558
01:53:36.430 --> 01:53:39.570
Forsaken your perniciousfaction

1559
01:53:39.570 --> 01:53:45.400
And join'd with Charles, therightful King of France.'

1560
01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:50.700
O monstrous treachery! canthis be so,

1561
01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:52.630
That in alliance, amityand oaths,

1562
01:53:52.630 --> 01:53:56.830
There should be found suchfalse dissembling guile?

1563
01:53:56.830 --> 01:53:59.400
What! doth my uncleBurgundy revolt?

1564
01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:02.530
He doth, my lord, and isbecome your foe.

1565
01:54:02.530 --> 01:54:04.470
Is that the worst thisletter doth contain?

1566
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:07.770
It is the worst, and all,my lord, he writes.

1567
01:54:07.770 --> 01:54:11.570
Why, then, Lord Talbotthere shall talk with him

1568
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:13.830
And give him chastisementfor this abuse.

1569
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:16.070
How say you, my lord? areyou not content?

1570
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:18.500
Content, my liege! yes,but that I am prevented,

1571
01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:21.500
I should have begg'd Imight have been employ'd.

1572
01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:24.230
Then gather strength andmarch unto him straight:

1573
01:54:24.230 --> 01:54:26.500
Let him perceive how illwe brook his treason

1574
01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:28.570
And what offence it is toflout his friends.

1575
01:54:28.570 --> 01:54:30.400
I go, my lord, in heartdesiring still

1576
01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:35.400
You may behold confusionin your foes.

1577
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:42.200
Grant me the combat,gracious sovereign.

1578
01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:44.300
And me, my lord, grant methe combat too.

1579
01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:46.500
This is my servant: hearhim, noble prince.

1580
01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:49.370
And this is mine: sweetHenry, favour him.

1581
01:54:49.370 --> 01:54:53.030
Be patient, lords; andgive them leave to speak.

1582
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:55.500
Say, gentlemen, what makesyou thus exclaim?

1583
01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:57.800
And wherefore crave youcombat? or with whom?

1584
01:54:57.800 --> 01:54:59.630
With him, my lord; for hehath done me wrong.

1585
01:54:59.630 --> 01:55:02.170
And I with him; for hehath done me wrong.

1586
01:55:02.170 --> 01:55:05.070
What is that wrong whereofyou both complain?

1587
01:55:05.070 --> 01:55:07.030
First let me know, andthen I'll answer you.

1588
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:10.430
Crossing the sea fromEngland into France,

1589
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:14.700
This fellow here, withenvious carping tongue,

1590
01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:17.270
Upbraided me about therose I wear;

1591
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:19.100
Saying, the sanguinecolour of the leaves

1592
01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:21.970
Did represent my master'sblushing cheeks,

1593
01:55:21.970 --> 01:55:24.070
When stubbornly he didrepugn the truth

1594
01:55:24.070 --> 01:55:26.570
About a certain questionin the law

1595
01:55:26.570 --> 01:55:29.200
Argued betwixt the Duke ofYork and him;

1596
01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:32.870
In confutation of whichrude reproach

1597
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:35.570
And in defence of mylord's worthiness,

1598
01:55:35.570 --> 01:55:38.070
I crave the benefit of lawof arms.

1599
01:55:38.070 --> 01:55:40.200
And that is my petition,noble lord:

1600
01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:43.330
For though he seem withforged quaint conceit

1601
01:55:43.330 --> 01:55:45.700
To set a gloss upon hisbold intent,

1602
01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:48.400
Yet know, my lord, I wasprovoked by him;

1603
01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:50.970
And he first tookexceptions at this badge,

1604
01:55:50.970 --> 01:55:53.600
Pronouncing that thepaleness of this flower

1605
01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:55.800
Bewray'd the faintness ofmy master's heart.

1606
01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:58.400
Will not this malice,Somerset, be left?

1607
01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:01.130
Your private grudge, myLord of York, will out,

1608
01:56:01.130 --> 01:56:04.270
Though ne'er so cunninglyyou smother it.

1609
01:56:04.270 --> 01:56:08.130
Good Lord, what madnessrules in brainsick men,

1610
01:56:08.130 --> 01:56:10.630
When for so slight andfrivolous a cause

1611
01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:14.470
Such factious emulationsshall arise!

1612
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:17.800
Good cousins both, of Yorkand Somerset,

1613
01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:21.770
Quiet yourselves, I pray,and be at peace.

1614
01:56:21.770 --> 01:56:25.230
Let this dissension firstbe tried by fight,

1615
01:56:25.230 --> 01:56:27.570
And then your highnessshall command a peace.

1616
01:56:27.570 --> 01:56:29.170
The quarrel toucheth nonebut us alone;

1617
01:56:29.170 --> 01:56:33.670
Betwixt ourselves let usdecide it then.

1618
01:56:33.670 --> 01:56:36.770
There is my pledge; acceptit, Somerset.

1619
01:56:36.770 --> 01:56:38.930
Nay, let it rest where itbegan at first.

1620
01:56:38.930 --> 01:56:41.070
Confirm it so, minehonourable lord.

1621
01:56:41.070 --> 01:56:45.530
Confirm it so! Confoundedbe your strife!

1622
01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:48.400
And perish ye, with youraudacious prate!

1623
01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:51.570
Presumptuous vassals, areyou not ashamed

1624
01:56:51.570 --> 01:56:54.100
With this immodestclamorous outrage

1625
01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:57.300
To trouble and disturb theking and us?

1626
01:56:57.300 --> 01:57:01.230
And you, my lords,methinks you do not well

1627
01:57:01.230 --> 01:57:04.270
To bear with theirperverse objections;

1628
01:57:04.270 --> 01:57:06.730
Much less to take occasionfrom their mouths

1629
01:57:06.730 --> 01:57:10.730
To raise a mutiny betwixtyourselves:

1630
01:57:10.730 --> 01:57:12.370
Let me persuade you take abetter course.

1631
01:57:12.370 --> 01:57:17.400
It grieves his highness:good my lords, be friends.

1632
01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:20.900
Come hither, you thatwould be combatants:

1633
01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:26.500
Henceforth I charge you,as you love our favour,

1634
01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:33.030
Quite to forget thisquarrel and the cause.

1635
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:44.000
And you, my lords,remember where we are,

1636
01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.600
In France, amongst afickle wavering nation:

1637
01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:49.330
If they perceivedissension in our looks

1638
01:57:49.330 --> 01:57:51.200
And that within ourselveswe disagree,

1639
01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:53.470
How will their grudgingstomachs be provoked

1640
01:57:53.470 --> 01:57:56.900
To wilful disobedience,and rebel!

1641
01:57:56.900 --> 01:57:59.670
Beside, what infamy willthere arise,

1642
01:57:59.670 --> 01:58:01.570
When foreign princes shallbe certified

1643
01:58:01.570 --> 01:58:04.030
That for a toy, a thing ofno regard,

1644
01:58:04.030 --> 01:58:06.570
King Henry's peers andchief nobility

1645
01:58:06.570 --> 01:58:11.170
Destroy'd themselves, andlost the realm of France!

1646
01:58:11.170 --> 01:58:16.030
O, think upon the conquestof my father,

1647
01:58:16.030 --> 01:58:19.630
My tender years, and letus not forego

1648
01:58:19.630 --> 01:58:24.030
That for a trifle that wasbought with blood

1649
01:58:24.700 --> 01:58:31.200
Let me be umpire in thisdoubtful strife.

1650
01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:39.700
I see no reason, if I wearthis rose,

1651
01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:40.970
That any one shouldtherefore be suspicious

1652
01:58:40.970 --> 01:58:44.530
I more incline to Somersetthan York:

1653
01:58:44.530 --> 01:58:48.300
Both are my kinsmen, and Ilove them both:

1654
01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:50.530
As well they may upbraidme with my crown,

1655
01:58:50.530 --> 01:58:53.270
Because, forsooth, theking of Scots is crown'd.

1656
01:58:54.900 --> 01:58:56.830
But your discretionsbetter can persuade

1657
01:58:56.830 --> 01:59:01.070
Than I am able to instructor teach:

1658
01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:04.100
And therefore, as wehither came in peace,

1659
01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:09.530
So let us still continuepeace and love.

1660
01:59:09.530 --> 01:59:12.700
Cousin of York, weinstitute your grace

1661
01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:16.970
To be our regent in theseparts of France:

1662
01:59:16.970 --> 01:59:20.700
And, good my Lord ofSomerset, unite

1663
01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:25.030
Your troops of horsemenwith his bands of foot;

1664
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:27.400
And, like true subjects,sons of your progenitors,

1665
01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:29.470
Go cheerfully together anddigest

1666
01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:33.870
Your angry choler on yourenemies.

1667
01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:35.900
Ourself, my lord protectorand the rest

1668
01:59:35.900 --> 01:59:38.670
After some respite willreturn to Calais;

1669
01:59:38.670 --> 01:59:41.500
From thence to England;where I hope ere long

1670
01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:44.030
To be presented, by yourvictories,

1671
01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:47.470
With Charles, Alencon andthat traitorous rout.

1672
02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:14.900
My Lord of York, I promiseyou, the king

1673
02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:17.630
Prettily, methought, didplay the orator.

1674
02:00:17.630 --> 02:00:23.230
And so he did; but yet Ilike it not,

1675
02:00:23.230 --> 02:00:25.230
In that he wears the badgeof Somerset.

1676
02:00:25.230 --> 02:00:28.530
Tush, that was but hisfancy, blame him not;

1677
02:00:28.530 --> 02:00:31.270
I dare presume, sweetprince, he thought no harm.

1678
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:41.070
An if I wist he did,--butlet it rest;

1679
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:49.370
Other affairs must now bemanaged.

1680
02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:54.500
Well didst thou, Richard,to suppress thy voice;

1681
02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:56.500
For, had the passions ofthy heart burst out,

1682
02:00:56.500 --> 02:00:58.500
I fear we should have seendecipher'd there

1683
02:00:58.500 --> 02:01:03.400
More rancorous spite, morefurious raging broils,

1684
02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:07.170
Than yet can be imaginedor supposed.

1685
02:01:07.170 --> 02:01:10.770
But howsoe'er, no simpleman that sees

1686
02:01:10.770 --> 02:01:14.200
This jarring discord ofnobility,

1687
02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:16.600
This shouldering of eachother in the court,

1688
02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:20.070
This factious bandying oftheir favourites,

1689
02:01:20.070 --> 02:01:25.200
But sees it doth presagesome ill event.

1690
02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:29.170
'Tis much when sceptresare in children's hands;

1691
02:01:29.170 --> 02:01:32.470
But more when envy breedsunkind division;

1692
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:36.830
There comes the ruin,there begins confusion.

1693
02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:01.230
Go to the gates ofBourdeaux, trumpeter:

1694
02:02:01.230 --> 02:02:04.470
Summon their general untothe wall.

1695
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:14.400
Trumpet sounds. EnterGeneral and others, aloft

1696
02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:20.630
English John Talbot,captains, calls you forth,

1697
02:02:20.630 --> 02:02:24.230
Servant in arms to HarryKing of England;

1698
02:02:24.230 --> 02:02:27.800
And thus he would: Openyour city gates;

1699
02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:31.600
Be humble to us; call mysovereign yours,

1700
02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:35.370
And do him homage asobedient subjects;

1701
02:02:35.370 --> 02:02:39.870
And I'll withdraw me andmy bloody power:

1702
02:02:39.870 --> 02:02:42.670
But, if you frown uponthis proffer'd peace,

1703
02:02:42.670 --> 02:02:45.430
You tempt the fury of mythree attendants,

1704
02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:49.670
Lean famine, quarteringsteel, and climbing fire;

1705
02:02:49.670 --> 02:02:51.800
Who in a moment even withthe earth

1706
02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:55.000
Shall lay your stately andair-braving towers,

1707
02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:59.370
If you forsake the offerof their love.

1708
02:02:59.370 --> 02:03:03.430
Thou ominous and fearfulowl of death,

1709
02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:07.130
Our nation's terror andtheir bloody scourge!

1710
02:03:07.130 --> 02:03:10.670
The period of thy tyrannyapproacheth.

1711
02:03:10.670 --> 02:03:14.230
On us thou canst not enterbut by death;

1712
02:03:14.230 --> 02:03:16.630
For, I protest, we arewell fortified

1713
02:03:16.630 --> 02:03:19.430
And strong enough to issueout and fight:

1714
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:23.370
If thou retire, theDauphin, well appointed,

1715
02:03:23.370 --> 02:03:27.800
Stands with the snares ofwar to tangle thee:

1716
02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:30.300
On either hand thee thereare squadrons pitch'd,

1717
02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:33.800
To wall thee from theliberty of flight;

1718
02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:36.530
And no way canst thou turnthee for redress,

1719
02:03:36.530 --> 02:03:39.670
But death doth front theewith apparent spoil

1720
02:03:39.670 --> 02:03:44.170
And pale destruction meetsthee in the face.

1721
02:03:44.170 --> 02:03:46.530
Ten thousand French haveta'en the sacrament

1722
02:03:46.530 --> 02:03:48.630
To rive their dangerousartillery

1723
02:03:48.630 --> 02:03:53.330
Upon no Christian soul butEnglish Talbot.

1724
02:03:53.330 --> 02:03:57.930
Lo, there thou stand'st, abreathing valiant man,

1725
02:03:57.930 --> 02:04:01.370
Of an invincibleunconquer'd spirit!

1726
02:04:01.370 --> 02:04:03.530
This is the latest gloryof thy praise

1727
02:04:03.530 --> 02:04:06.470
That I, thy enemy, duethee withal;

1728
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:09.500
For ere the glass, thatnow begins to run,

1729
02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:12.430
Finish the process of hissandy hour,

1730
02:04:12.430 --> 02:04:16.430
These eyes, that see theenow well coloured,

1731
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:21.530
Shall see thee wither'd,bloody, pale and dead.

1732
02:04:22.630 --> 02:04:27.230
Hark! hark! the Dauphin'sdrum, a warning bell,

1733
02:04:27.230 --> 02:04:31.870
Sings heavy music to thytimorous soul;

1734
02:04:31.870 --> 02:04:36.400
And mine shall ring thydire departure out.

1735
02:04:42.370 --> 02:04:49.700
He fables not; I hear theenemy:

1736
02:04:53.630 --> 02:04:58.530
Out, some light horsemen,and peruse their wings.

1737
02:04:58.530 --> 02:05:05.170
O, negligent and heedlessdiscipline!

1738
02:05:08.830 --> 02:05:13.970
How are we park'd andbounded in a pale,

1739
02:05:13.970 --> 02:05:18.470
A little herd of England'stimorous deer,

1740
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:24.530
Mazed with akennel of French curs!

1741
02:05:24.530 --> 02:05:30.870
If we be English deer, bethen in blood;

1742
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:33.570
Not rascal-like, to falldown with a pinch,

1743
02:05:33.570 --> 02:05:36.970
But rather, moody-mad anddesperate stags,

1744
02:05:36.970 --> 02:05:41.530
Turn on the bloody houndswith heads of steel

1745
02:05:41.530 --> 02:05:43.630
And make the cowards standaloof at bay:

1746
02:05:43.630 --> 02:05:47.330
Sell every man his life asdear as mine,

1747
02:05:47.330 --> 02:05:51.830
And they shall find deardeer of us, my friends.

1748
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:57.470
God and Saint George,England and England's right,

1749
02:05:57.470 --> 02:06:02.970
Prosper our colours inthis dangerous fight!

1750
02:06:08.670 --> 02:06:10.100
Are not the speedy scoutsreturn'd again,

1751
02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:12.130
That dogg'd the mightyarmy of the Dauphin?

1752
02:06:12.130 --> 02:06:13.230
They are return'd, mylord, and give it out

1753
02:06:13.230 --> 02:06:15.430
That he is march'd toBourdeaux with his power,

1754
02:06:15.430 --> 02:06:17.570
To fight with Talbot: ashe march'd along,

1755
02:06:17.570 --> 02:06:19.270
By your espials werediscovered

1756
02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:21.000
Two mightier troops thanthat the Dauphin led,

1757
02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.300
Which join'd with him and madetheir march for Bourdeaux.

1758
02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:26.770
A plague upon that villainSomerset,

1759
02:06:26.770 --> 02:06:28.370
That thus delays mypromised supply

1760
02:06:28.370 --> 02:06:31.630
Of horsemen, that werelevied for this siege!

1761
02:06:31.630 --> 02:06:34.970
Renowned Talbot dothexpect my aid,

1762
02:06:34.970 --> 02:06:37.600
And I am lowted by atraitor villain

1763
02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:40.800
And cannot help the noblechevalier:

1764
02:06:41.170 --> 02:06:44.270
God comfort him in thisnecessity!

1765
02:06:44.270 --> 02:06:46.570
If he miscarry, farewellwars in France.

1766
02:06:46.570 --> 02:06:49.530
Thou princely leader ofour English strength,

1767
02:06:49.530 --> 02:06:51.370
Never so needful on theearth of France,

1768
02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:53.830
Spur to the rescue of thenoble Talbot,

1769
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:56.670
Who now is girdled with awaist of iron

1770
02:06:56.670 --> 02:06:59.370
And hemm'd about with grimdestruction:

1771
02:06:59.370 --> 02:07:03.000
To Bourdeaux, warlikeduke! to Bourdeaux, York!

1772
02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:06.530
Else, farewell Talbot,France, and England's honour.

1773
02:07:06.530 --> 02:07:10.430
O God, that Somerset, whoin proud heart

1774
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:16.670
Doth stop my cornets, werein Talbot's place!

1775
02:07:16.670 --> 02:07:19.570
So should we save avaliant gentleman

1776
02:07:19.570 --> 02:07:24.200
By forfeiting a traitorand a coward.

1777
02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:27.930
Mad ire and wrathful furymakes me weep,

1778
02:07:27.930 --> 02:07:33.500
That thus we die, whileremiss traitors sleep.

1779
02:07:33.500 --> 02:07:40.070
O, send some succor to thedistress'd lord!

1780
02:07:40.530 --> 02:07:49.370
He dies, we lose; I breakmy warlike word;

1781
02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:58.770
We mourn, France smiles;we lose, they daily get;

1782
02:07:58.770 --> 02:08:02.930
All 'long of this viletraitor Somerset.

1783
02:08:04.430 --> 02:08:08.330
Then God take mercy onbrave Talbot's soul;

1784
02:08:08.330 --> 02:08:11.200
And on his son young John,who two hours since

1785
02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:14.670
I met in travel toward hiswarlike father!

1786
02:08:14.670 --> 02:08:19.330
This seven years did notTalbot see his son;

1787
02:08:19.330 --> 02:08:25.200
And now they meet whereboth their lives are done.

1788
02:08:26.730 --> 02:08:33.500
Alas, what joy shall nobleTalbot have

1789
02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:40.830
To bid his young sonwelcome to his grave?

1790
02:08:40.830 --> 02:08:44.570
Away! vexation almoststops my breath,

1791
02:08:44.570 --> 02:08:50.730
That sunder'd friends greetin the hour of death.

1792
02:08:50.730 --> 02:08:56.070
Lucy, farewell; no more myfortune can,

1793
02:08:56.070 --> 02:09:03.270
But curse the cause Icannot aid the man.

1794
02:09:03.270 --> 02:09:10.170
Maine, Blois, Poictiers,and Tours, are won away,

1795
02:09:10.170 --> 02:09:16.970
'Long all of Somerset andhis delay.

1796
02:09:20.330 --> 02:09:25.700
Thus, while the vulture ofsedition

1797
02:09:25.700 --> 02:09:29.470
Feeds in the bosom of suchgreat commanders,

1798
02:09:29.470 --> 02:09:32.630
Sleeping neglection dothbetray to loss

1799
02:09:32.630 --> 02:09:35.970
The conquest of our scarcecold conqueror,

1800
02:09:35.970 --> 02:09:37.700
That ever living man ofmemory,

1801
02:09:37.700 --> 02:09:44.770
Henry the Fifth: whilesthey each other cross,

1802
02:09:44.770 --> 02:09:49.400
Lives, honours, lands andall hurry to loss.

1803
02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:53.900
It is too late; I cannotsend them now:

1804
02:09:53.900 --> 02:09:55.030
This expedition was byYork and Talbot

1805
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:57.470
Too rashly plotted: Your daring Talbot

1806
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:59.200
Hath sullied all his glossof former honour

1807
02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:02.570
By this unheedful,desperate, wild adventure:

1808
02:10:02.570 --> 02:10:04.830
York set him on to fightand die in shame,

1809
02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:07.700
That, Talbot dead, greatYork might bear the name.

1810
02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:09.330
Here is Sir William Lucy,who with me

1811
02:10:09.330 --> 02:10:14.870
Set from our o'ermatch'dforces forth for aid.

1812
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:20.730
How now, Sir William!whither were you sent?

1813
02:10:20.730 --> 02:10:27.200
Whither, my lord? frombought and sold Lord Talbot;

1814
02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:29.300
Who, ring'd about withbold adversity,

1815
02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:33.800
Cries out for noble Yorkand Somerset,

1816
02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:37.400
To beat assailing deathfrom his weak legions:

1817
02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:40.170
And whiles the honourablecaptain there

1818
02:10:40.170 --> 02:10:42.730
Drops bloody sweat fromhis war-wearied limbs,

1819
02:10:42.730 --> 02:10:46.300
And, in advantage lingering,looks for rescue,

1820
02:10:46.300 --> 02:10:52.170
You, his false hopes, thetrust of England's honour,

1821
02:10:52.170 --> 02:10:55.270
Keep off aloof withworthless emulation.

1822
02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:57.900
Let not your privatediscord keep away

1823
02:10:57.900 --> 02:11:01.270
The levied succors thatshould lend him aid,

1824
02:11:01.270 --> 02:11:03.600
While he, renowned noblegentleman,

1825
02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:05.900
Yields up his life unto aworld of odds:

1826
02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:08.470
Orleans the Bastard,Charles, Burgundy,

1827
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:10.870
Alencon, Reignier, compasshim about,

1828
02:11:10.870 --> 02:11:13.700
And Talbot perisheth byyour default.

1829
02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:18.800
York set him on; Yorkshould have sent him aid.

1830
02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:21.130
And York as fast upon yourgrace exclaims;

1831
02:11:21.130 --> 02:11:24.530
Swearing that you withholdhis levied horse,

1832
02:11:24.530 --> 02:11:25.570
Collected for thisexpedition.

1833
02:11:25.570 --> 02:11:28.500
York lies; he might havesent and had the horse;

1834
02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:30.230
I owe him little duty, andless love;

1835
02:11:30.230 --> 02:11:35.530
And take foul scorn tofawn on him by sending.

1836
02:11:35.530 --> 02:11:39.830
The fraud of England, notthe force of France,

1837
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:43.570
Hath now entrapp'd thenoble-minded Talbot:

1838
02:11:43.570 --> 02:11:47.430
Never to England shall hebear his life;

1839
02:11:47.430 --> 02:11:54.230
But dies, betray'd tofortune by your strife.

1840
02:11:54.230 --> 02:11:58.870
Come, go; I will dispatchthe horsemen straight:

1841
02:11:58.870 --> 02:12:00.570
Within six hours they willbe at his side.

1842
02:12:00.570 --> 02:12:04.270
Too late comes rescue: heis ta'en or slain;

1843
02:12:04.270 --> 02:12:09.770
For fly he could not, ifhe would have fled;

1844
02:12:09.770 --> 02:12:15.830
And fly would Talbotnever, though he might.

1845
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:22.370
If he be dead, braveTalbot, then adieu!

1846
02:12:22.370 --> 02:12:29.600
His fame lives in theworld, his shame in you.

1847
02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:43.270
(crowd chants together) ATalbot.

1848
02:12:50.030 --> 02:12:57.730
Drums beating. Swords clanging.

1849
02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:35.700
O young John Talbot! I didsend for thee

1850
02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:37.830
To tutor thee instratagems of war,

1851
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:40.230
That Talbot's name mightbe in thee revived

1852
02:13:40.230 --> 02:13:43.070
But, O malignant andill-boding stars!

1853
02:13:43.070 --> 02:13:45.100
Now thou art come unto afeast of death,

1854
02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:47.570
A terrible and unavoideddanger:

1855
02:13:47.570 --> 02:13:49.830
Therefore, dear boy, mounton my swiftest horse;

1856
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:51.600
And I'll direct thee howthou shalt escape

1857
02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:57.300
By sudden flight: come,dally not, be gone.

1858
02:13:57.300 --> 02:14:01.200
Is my name Talbot? and amI your son?

1859
02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:05.530
And shall I fly? O if youlove my mother,

1860
02:14:05.530 --> 02:14:06.770
Dishonour not herhonourable name,

1861
02:14:06.770 --> 02:14:11.370
To make a bastard and aslave of me!

1862
02:14:11.370 --> 02:14:13.600
The world will say, he isnot Talbot's blood,

1863
02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:16.670
That basely fled whennoble Talbot stood.

1864
02:14:16.670 --> 02:14:18.330
Fly, to revenge my death,if I be slain.

1865
02:14:18.330 --> 02:14:20.100
He that flies so willne'er return again.

1866
02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:24.370
If we both stay, we bothare sure to die.

1867
02:14:24.370 --> 02:14:26.670
Then let me stay; and,father, do you fly:

1868
02:14:26.670 --> 02:14:29.430
Your loss is great, soyour regard should be;

1869
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:31.570
My worth unknown, no lossis known in me.

1870
02:14:31.570 --> 02:14:33.700
Upon my death the Frenchcan little boast;

1871
02:14:33.700 --> 02:14:37.000
In yours they will, in youall hopes are lost.

1872
02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.100
Flight cannot stain thehonour you have won;

1873
02:14:39.100 --> 02:14:42.730
But mine it will, that noexploit have done:

1874
02:14:42.730 --> 02:14:46.000
You fled for vantage,everyone will swear;

1875
02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:50.030
But, if I bow, they'll sayit was for fear.

1876
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:51.570
There is no hope that everI will stay,

1877
02:14:51.570 --> 02:14:54.430
If the first hour I shrinkand run away.

1878
02:14:54.430 --> 02:14:57.800
Here on my knee I begmortality,

1879
02:14:57.800 --> 02:14:59.870
Rather than life preservedwith infamy.

1880
02:14:59.870 --> 02:15:02.500
Shall all thy mother'shopes lie in one tomb?

1881
02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:04.730
Ay, rather than I'll shamemy mother's womb.

1882
02:15:04.730 --> 02:15:06.430
Upon my blessing, Icommand thee go.

1883
02:15:06.430 --> 02:15:08.630
To fight I will, but notto fly the foe.

1884
02:15:08.630 --> 02:15:10.930
Part of thy father may besaved in thee.

1885
02:15:10.930 --> 02:15:13.370
No part of him but will beshame in me.

1886
02:15:13.370 --> 02:15:15.400
Thou never hadst renown,nor canst not lose it.

1887
02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:18.530
Yes, your renowned name:shall flight abuse it?

1888
02:15:18.530 --> 02:15:21.000
Thy father's charge shallclear thee from that stain.

1889
02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:24.170
You cannot witness for me,being slain.

1890
02:15:24.170 --> 02:15:26.000
If death be so apparent,then both fly.

1891
02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.430
And leave my followershere to fight and die?

1892
02:15:28.430 --> 02:15:30.700
My age was never taintedwith such shame.

1893
02:15:30.700 --> 02:15:36.070
And shall my youth beguilty of such blame?

1894
02:15:36.070 --> 02:15:38.830
No more can I be sever'dfrom your side,

1895
02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:42.870
Than can yourself yourselfin twain divide:

1896
02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:47.370
Stay, go, do what youwill, the like do I;

1897
02:15:47.370 --> 02:15:53.300
For live I will not, if myfather die.

1898
02:15:56.530 --> 02:16:03.600
Then here I take my leaveof thee, fair son,

1899
02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:10.600
Born to eclipse thy lifethis afternoon.

1900
02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:17.600
Come, side by sidetogether live and die.

1901
02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:22.770
And soul with soul fromFrance to heaven fly.

1902
02:16:24.730 --> 02:16:29.030
(Drums beating, bugle blaring)

1903
02:16:32.730 --> 02:16:37.570
Saint George and victory!fight, soldiers, fight.

1904
02:16:37.570 --> 02:16:40.200
The regent hath withTalbot broke his word

1905
02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:44.930
And left us to the rage ofFrance his sword.

1906
02:16:44.930 --> 02:16:52.430
(swords clanging)

1907
02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:48.530
(screaming)

1908
02:17:50.670 --> 02:18:04.930
Where is John Talbot? (repeated)

1909
02:18:04.930 --> 02:18:14.830
Speak, thy father's care,

1910
02:18:14.830 --> 02:18:19.130
Art thou not weary, John?how dost thou fare?

1911
02:18:19.130 --> 02:18:22.070
Wilt thou yet leave thebattle, boy, and fly,

1912
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:25.370
Now thou art seal'd theson of chivalry?

1913
02:18:25.370 --> 02:18:28.030
Fly, to revenge my deathwhen I am dead:

1914
02:18:28.030 --> 02:18:32.000
The help of one stands mein little stead.

1915
02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.000
O, too much folly is it,well I wot,

1916
02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:39.670
To hazard all our lives inone small boat!

1917
02:18:39.670 --> 02:18:42.400
If I to-day die not withFrenchmen's rage,

1918
02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:45.430
To-morrow I shall die withmickle age:

1919
02:18:45.430 --> 02:18:47.730
By me they nothing gain anif I stay;

1920
02:18:47.730 --> 02:18:50.770
'Tis but the shortening ofmy life one day:

1921
02:18:50.770 --> 02:18:53.300
In thee thy mother dies,our household's name,

1922
02:18:53.300 --> 02:18:59.300
My death's revenge, thyyouth, and England's fame:

1923
02:18:59.300 --> 02:19:03.130
All these and more wehazard by thy stay;

1924
02:19:03.130 --> 02:19:07.270
All these are saved ifthou wilt fly away.

1925
02:19:07.270 --> 02:19:11.030
The sword of Orleans hathnot made me smart;

1926
02:19:11.030 --> 02:19:16.730
These words of yours drawlife-blood from my heart:

1927
02:19:16.730 --> 02:19:20.800
On that advantage, boughtwith such a shame,

1928
02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:25.370
To save a paltry life andslay bright fame,

1929
02:19:25.370 --> 02:19:28.030
Before young Talbot fromold Talbot fly,

1930
02:19:28.030 --> 02:19:32.630
The coward horse thatbears me fall and die!

1931
02:19:32.630 --> 02:19:37.200
And like me to the peasantboys of France,

1932
02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:43.170
To be shame's scorn andsubject of mischance!

1933
02:19:43.170 --> 02:19:50.330
Surely, by all the gloryyou have won,

1934
02:19:50.330 --> 02:19:55.430
An if I fly, I am notTalbot's son:

1935
02:19:55.430 --> 02:19:59.670
Then talk no more offlight, it is no boot;

1936
02:19:59.670 --> 02:20:08.200
If son to Talbot, die atTalbot's foot.

1937
02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:13.400
Then follow thou thydesperate sire of Crete,

1938
02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:21.930
Thou Icarus; thy life tome is sweet:

1939
02:20:23.770 --> 02:20:30.470
If thou wilt fight, fightby thy father's side;

1940
02:20:30.470 --> 02:20:37.730
And, commendable proved,let's die in pride.

1941
02:20:43.900 --> 02:20:49.270
(Sounds of the fight.Bugle blaring)

1942
02:21:40.030 --> 02:21:44.170
Where is my other life?mine own is gone;

1943
02:21:44.170 --> 02:21:52.270
O, where's young Talbot?where is valiant John?

1944
02:21:52.270 --> 02:21:58.300
Triumphant death, smear'dwith captivity,

1945
02:21:58.300 --> 02:22:05.230
Young Talbot's valourmakes me smile at thee:

1946
02:22:05.230 --> 02:22:08.270
When he perceived meshrink and on my knee,

1947
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:13.400
His bloody sword hebrandish'd over me,

1948
02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:15.530
And, like a hungry lion,did commence

1949
02:22:15.530 --> 02:22:21.270
Rough deeds of rage andstern impatience;

1950
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:25.130
But when my angry guardantstood alone,

1951
02:22:25.130 --> 02:22:29.500
Tendering my ruin andassail'd of none,

1952
02:22:29.500 --> 02:22:34.130
Dizzy-eyed fury and greatrage of heart

1953
02:22:34.130 --> 02:22:38.170
Suddenly made him from myside to start

1954
02:22:38.170 --> 02:22:42.470
Into the clustering battleof the French;

1955
02:22:42.470 --> 02:22:50.370
And in that sea of bloodmy boy did drench

1956
02:22:50.370 --> 02:22:58.930
His over-mounting spirit,and there died,

1957
02:22:58.930 --> 02:23:11.400
My Icarus, my blossom, inhis pride.

1958
02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:16.370
O, my dear lord, lo, whereyour son is borne!

1959
02:23:28.370 --> 02:23:35.630
Thou antic death, whichlaugh'st us here to scorn,

1960
02:23:35.630 --> 02:23:40.770
Anon, from thy insultingtyranny,

1961
02:23:40.770 --> 02:23:45.030
Coupled in bonds ofperpetuity,

1962
02:23:45.030 --> 02:23:49.900
Two Talbots, wingedthrough the lither sky,

1963
02:23:49.900 --> 02:23:58.370
In thy despite shall'scape mortality.

1964
02:24:01.130 --> 02:24:07.770
O, thou, whose woundsbecome hard-favour'd death,

1965
02:24:07.770 --> 02:24:15.030
Speak to thy father erethou yield thy breath!

1966
02:24:15.030 --> 02:24:21.530
Brave death by speaking,whether he will or no;

1967
02:24:21.530 --> 02:24:28.170
Imagine him a Frenchmanand thy foe.

1968
02:24:28.170 --> 02:24:34.530
Poor boy! he smiles,methinks, as who should say,

1969
02:24:34.530 --> 02:24:42.030
Had death been French, thendeath had died to-day.

1970
02:24:48.030 --> 02:24:54.830
Come, come and lay him inhis father's arms:

1971
02:24:54.830 --> 02:24:59.830
My spirit can no longerbear these harms.

1972
02:25:06.530 --> 02:25:14.900
Soldiers, adieu! I havewhat I would have,

1973
02:25:14.900 --> 02:25:23.030
Now my old arms are youngJohn Talbot's grave.

1974
02:25:29.330 --> 02:25:31.000
Had York and Somersetbrought rescue in,

1975
02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:32.730
We should have found abloody day of this.

1976
02:25:32.730 --> 02:25:35.470
How the young whelp ofTalbot's, raging-wood,

1977
02:25:35.470 --> 02:25:38.270
Did flesh his puny swordin Frenchmen's blood!

1978
02:25:38.270 --> 02:25:43.770
Doubtless he would havemade a noble knight;

1979
02:25:43.770 --> 02:25:47.430
See, where he liesinhearsed in the arms

1980
02:25:47.430 --> 02:25:50.500
Of the most bloody nurserof his harms!

1981
02:25:59.970 --> 02:26:05.430
Hew them to pieces, hacktheir bones asunder

1982
02:26:05.430 --> 02:26:09.030
Whose life was England'sglory, Gallia's wonder.

1983
02:26:09.030 --> 02:26:11.000
O, no, forbear! for thatwhich we have fled

1984
02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.330
During the life, let usnot wrong it dead.

1985
02:26:18.230 --> 02:26:19.300
Herald, conduct me to theDauphin's tent,

1986
02:26:19.300 --> 02:26:21.500
To know who hath obtainedthe glory of the day.

1987
02:26:21.500 --> 02:26:24.930
On what submissive messageart thou sent?

1988
02:26:24.930 --> 02:26:28.930
Submission, Dauphin! 'tisa mere French word;

1989
02:26:28.930 --> 02:26:32.530
We English warriors wotnot what it means.

1990
02:26:32.530 --> 02:26:34.630
I come to know whatprisoners thou hast ta'en

1991
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:37.330
And to survey the bodiesof the dead.

1992
02:26:37.330 --> 02:26:45.430
For prisoners ask'st thou?hell our prison is.

1993
02:26:45.430 --> 02:26:48.270
But tell me whom thouseek'st.

1994
02:26:48.270 --> 02:26:51.130
But where's the greatAlcides of the field,

1995
02:26:51.130 --> 02:26:54.600

Of all his wars within therealm of France?

2006
02:27:23.370 --> 02:27:27.500
Him that thou magnifiestwith all these titles

2007
02:27:27.500 --> 02:27:32.500
Stinking and fly-blownlies here at our feet.

2008
02:27:43.870 --> 02:27:48.230
Is Talbot slain?

2009
02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:51.700
O, were mine eyeballs intobullets turn'd,

2010
02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:55.800
That I in rage might shootthem at your faces!

2011
02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:59.030
O, that I could but callthese dead to life!

2012
02:27:59.030 --> 02:28:03.000
It were enough to frightthe realm of France:

2013
02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:04.270
Were but his picture leftamongst you here,

2014
02:28:04.270 --> 02:28:08.870
It would amaze theproudest of you all.

2015
02:28:10.100 --> 02:28:13.370
Give me their bodies, thatI may bear them hence

2016
02:28:13.370 --> 02:28:15.730
And give them burial asbeseems their worth.

2017
02:28:15.730 --> 02:28:18.100
For God's sake let him have'em; to keep them here,

2018
02:28:18.100 --> 02:28:20.970
They would but stink, andputrefy the air.

2019
02:28:20.970 --> 02:28:24.000
Go, take their bodieshence.

2020
02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:28.530
I'll bear them hence; but fromtheir ashes shall be rear'd

2021
02:28:28.530 --> 02:28:31.900
A phoenix that shall makeall France afeard.

2022
02:28:31.900 --> 02:28:38.330
So we be rid, dowith 'em what thou wilt.

2023
02:28:39.300 --> 02:28:41.000
A success unto ourvalley general

2024
02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:42.500
and happiness tohis accomplices.

2025
02:28:42.500 --> 02:28:44.670
What tidings send us scouts? Iprithy, speak.

2026
02:28:44.670 --> 02:28:47.600
The English army, that dividedwas it to two parties

2027
02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:49.170
is now conjoined in one

2028
02:28:49.170 --> 02:28:53.370
and means to give youbattle presently.

2029
02:28:53.370 --> 02:28:55.970
Somewhat to sudden says thewarning is

2030
02:28:55.970 --> 02:28:57.570
but we will presently providefor them

2031
02:28:57.570 --> 02:29:00.570
I trust the ghost of Talbot isnot there.

2032
02:29:00.570 --> 02:29:05.400
Haha. Now he is gone my lord.You need not fear.

2033
02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:12.070
Of all based passions, fear ismost accursed.

02:29:12.070 --> 02:29:14.570
Command the conquest Charles.It shall by thine.

2035
02:29:14.570 --> 02:29:18.170

â™ªchanting Amen

2040
02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:14.530
The emperor and the Earlof Armagnac?

Well, my good lord; and asthe only means

To stop effusion of ourChristian blood

And 'stablish quietness onevery side.

2049
02:30:38.500 --> 02:30:40.430
Ay, marry, uncle; for Ialways thought

2050
02:30:40.430 --> 02:30:42.170
It was both impious andunnatural

2051
02:30:42.170 --> 02:30:43.900
That such immanity andbloody strife

2052
02:30:43.900 --> 02:30:46.630
Should reign amongprofessors of one faith.

2053
02:30:46.630 --> 02:30:49.170
Beside, my lord, thesooner to effect

2054
02:30:49.170 --> 02:30:51.770
And surer bind this knotof amity,

2055
02:30:51.770 --> 02:30:55.030
The Earl of Armagnac, nearknit to Charles,

2056
02:30:55.030 --> 02:30:57.970
A man of great authorityin France,

2057
02:30:57.970 --> 02:31:01.800
Proffers his only daughterto your grace

2058
02:31:01.800 --> 02:31:07.270
In marriage, with a largeand sumptuous dowry.

2059
02:31:07.270 --> 02:31:10.030
Marriage, uncle! alas, myyears are young!

2060
02:31:10.030 --> 02:31:12.000
And fitter is my study andmy books

2061
02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.300
Than wanton dalliance witha paramour.

2062
02:31:20.670 --> 02:31:22.870
Yet call the ambassador;and, as you please,

2063
02:31:22.870 --> 02:31:26.900
So let them have theiranswers every one:

2064
02:31:26.900 --> 02:31:28.670
I shall be well contentwith any choice

2065
02:31:28.670 --> 02:31:32.900
Tends to God's glory andmy country's weal.

2066
02:31:32.900 --> 02:31:35.730
What! is my Lord ofWinchester install'd,

2067
02:31:35.730 --> 02:31:37.930
And call'd unto acardinal's degree?

2068
02:31:37.930 --> 02:31:39.200
Then I perceive that willbe verified

2069
02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:41.900
Henry the Fifth didsometime prophesy,

2070
02:31:41.900 --> 02:31:43.930
'If once he come to be acardinal,

2071
02:31:43.930 --> 02:31:47.300
He'll make his capco-equal with the crown.'

2072
02:31:50.430 --> 02:31:54.300
My lords ambassadors, yourseveral suits

2073
02:31:54.300 --> 02:31:56.670
Have been consider'd anddebated on.

2074
02:31:56.670 --> 02:31:59.730
Your purpose is both good andreasonable.

2075
02:31:59.730 --> 02:32:01.770
And therefore are wecertainly resolved

2076
02:32:01.770 --> 02:32:03.600
To draw conditions of afriendly peace;

2077
02:32:03.600 --> 02:32:05.530
Which by my Lord ofWinchester we mean

2078
02:32:05.530 --> 02:32:09.800
Shall be transportedpresently to France.

2079
02:32:09.800 --> 02:32:14.630
And for the proffer of mylord your master,

2080
02:32:14.630 --> 02:32:17.000
I have inform'd hishighness so at large

2081
02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:21.200
As liking of the lady'svirtuous gifts,

2082
02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:25.470
Her beauty and the valueof her dower,

2083
02:32:25.470 --> 02:32:30.030
He doth intend she shallbe England's queen.

2084
02:32:31.530 --> 02:32:34.370
In argument and proof ofwhich contract,

2085
02:32:34.370 --> 02:32:39.530
Bear her this jewel,pledge of my affection.

2086
02:32:40.470 --> 02:32:42.470
And so, my lord protector,see them guarded

2087
02:32:42.470 --> 02:32:45.400
And safely brought toDover; where inshipp'd

2088
02:32:45.400 --> 02:32:48.700
Commit them to the fortuneof the sea.

2089
02:32:57.370 --> 02:33:03.000
Stay, my lord legate: youshall first receive

2090
02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:04.800
The sum of money which Ipromised

2091
02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:06.830
Should be deliver'd to hisholiness

2092
02:33:06.830 --> 02:33:10.800
For clothing me in thesegrave ornaments.

2093
02:33:10.800 --> 02:33:16.000
I will attend upon yourlordship's leisure.

2094
02:33:18.830 --> 02:33:22.500
Now Winchester will notsubmit, I trow,

2095
02:33:22.500 --> 02:33:25.830
Or be inferior to theproudest peer.

2096
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:27.930
Humphrey of Gloucester,thou shalt well perceive

2097
02:33:27.930 --> 02:33:30.700
That, neither in birth orfor authority,

2098
02:33:30.700 --> 02:33:34.000
The bishop will beoverborne by thee:

2099
02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:37.470
I'll either make theestoop and bend thy knee,

2100
02:33:37.470 --> 02:33:41.370
Or sack this country witha mutiny.

2101
02:33:52.400 --> 02:33:56.470
The regent conquers, andthe Frenchmen fly.

2102
02:33:56.470 --> 02:33:59.700
Now help, ye charmingspells and periapts;

2103
02:33:59.700 --> 02:34:02.070
And ye choice spirits thatadmonish me

2104
02:34:02.070 --> 02:34:07.170
Appear and aid me in thisenterprise.

2105
02:34:07.170 --> 02:34:09.500
Now, ye familiar spirits,that are cull'd

2106
02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:11.970
Out of the powerfulregions under earth,

2107
02:34:11.970 --> 02:34:16.830
Help me this once, thatFrance may get the field.

2108
02:34:16.830 --> 02:34:19.630
O, hold me not withsilence over-long!

2109
02:34:19.630 --> 02:34:22.030
Where I was wont to feedyou with my blood,

2110
02:34:22.030 --> 02:34:23.800
I'll lop a member off andgive it you

2111
02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:25.600
In earnest of furtherbenefit,

2112
02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:30.200
So you do condescend tohelp me now.

2113
02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:33.400
No hope to have redress?My body shall

2114
02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:38.830
Pay recompense, if youwill grant my suit.

2115
02:34:38.830 --> 02:34:40.970
Cannot my body norblood-sacrifice

2116
02:34:40.970 --> 02:34:44.700
Entreat you to your wontedfurtherance?

2117
02:34:44.700 --> 02:34:47.970
Then take my soul, mybody, soul and all,

2118
02:34:47.970 --> 02:34:53.200
Before that England givethe French the foil.

2119
02:34:55.970 --> 02:35:01.370
See, they forsake me!

2120
02:35:01.370 --> 02:35:05.500
My ancient incantationsare too weak,

2121
02:35:05.500 --> 02:35:09.970
And hell too strong for meto buckle with:

2122
02:35:10.330 --> 02:35:17.230
Now, France, thy glorydroopeth to the dust.

2123
02:35:30.470 --> 02:35:38.370
Damsel of France, I thinkI have you fast:

2124
02:35:38.370 --> 02:35:44.630
A goodly prize, fit forthe devil's grace!

2125
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:48.100
See, how the ugly wenchdoth bend her brows,

2126
02:35:48.100 --> 02:35:50.500
As if with Circe she wouldchange my shape!

2127
02:35:50.500 --> 02:35:53.970
Changed to a worser shapethou canst not be.

2128
02:35:53.970 --> 02:35:57.070
O, Charles the Dauphin isa proper man;

2129
02:35:57.070 --> 02:36:01.800
No shape but his canplease your dainty eye.

2130
02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:04.500
A plaguing mischief lighton Charles and thee!

2131
02:36:04.500 --> 02:36:07.100
And may ye both besuddenly surprised

2132
02:36:07.100 --> 02:36:10.470
By bloody hands, insleeping on your beds!

2133
02:36:10.470 --> 02:36:13.530
Fell banning hag,enchantress, hold thy tongue!

2134
02:36:13.530 --> 02:36:15.300
I prithee, give me leaveto curse awhile.

2135
02:36:15.300 --> 02:36:18.830
Curse, miscreant, whenthou comest to the stake.

2136
02:36:23.970 --> 02:36:34.170
Be what thou wilt, thouart my prisoner.

2137
02:36:34.170 --> 02:36:39.370
O fairest beauty, do notfear nor fly!

2138
02:36:39.370 --> 02:36:42.570
For I will touch thee butwith reverent hands;

2139
02:36:42.570 --> 02:36:47.370
And lay them gentlyon thy tender side.

2140
02:36:47.370 --> 02:36:51.830
I kiss these fingersfor eternal peace,

2141
02:36:52.670 --> 02:36:57.070
Who art thou? say, that Imay honour thee.

2142
02:36:57.070 --> 02:37:01.530
Margaret my name, anddaughter to a king,

2143
02:37:01.530 --> 02:37:05.470
The King of Naples,whosoe'er thou art.

2144
02:37:05.470 --> 02:37:12.270
An earl I am, and Suffolkam I call'd.

2145
02:37:12.270 --> 02:37:14.970
Be not offended, nature'smiracle,

2146
02:37:14.970 --> 02:37:17.830
Thou art allotted to beta'en by me:

2147
02:37:17.830 --> 02:37:21.530
So doth the swan her downycygnets save,

2148
02:37:21.530 --> 02:37:27.070
Keeping them prisonerunderneath her wings.

2149
02:37:27.070 --> 02:37:30.430
But, if this servile usageonce offend.

2150
02:37:30.430 --> 02:37:35.770
Go, and be free again, asSuffolk's friend.

2151
02:37:35.770 --> 02:37:47.030
O, stay! I have no powerto let her pass;

2152
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:50.170
My hand would free her,but my heart says no

2153
02:37:50.170 --> 02:37:53.770
As plays the sun upon theglassy streams,

2154
02:37:53.770 --> 02:37:55.500
Twinkling anothercounterfeited beam,

2155
02:37:55.500 --> 02:38:02.500
So seems this gorgeousbeauty to mine eyes.

2156
02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:06.270
Fain would I woo her, yetI dare not speak:

2157
02:38:06.270 --> 02:38:09.770
I'll call for pen and ink,and write my mind.

2158
02:38:09.770 --> 02:38:12.600
Fie, de la Pole! disablenot thyself;

2159
02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:16.600
Hast not a tongue? is shenot prisoner here?

2160
02:38:16.600 --> 02:38:23.730
Wilt thou be daunted at awoman's sight?

2161
02:38:23.730 --> 02:38:27.830
Ay, beauty's princelymajesty is such,

2162
02:38:27.830 --> 02:38:31.570
Confounds the tongue andmakes the senses rough.

2163
02:38:31.570 --> 02:38:35.430
Say, Earl of Suffolk--ifthy name be so--

2164
02:38:35.430 --> 02:38:38.070
What ransom must I paybefore I pass?

2165
02:38:38.070 --> 02:38:40.570
For I perceive I am thyprisoner.

2166
02:38:40.570 --> 02:38:42.600
How canst thou tell shewill deny thy suit,

2167
02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:44.800
Before thou make a trialof her love?

2168
02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:48.030
Why speak'st thou not?what ransom must I pay?

2169
02:38:48.030 --> 02:38:51.270
She's beautiful, andtherefore to be woo'd;

2170
02:38:51.270 --> 02:38:53.530
She is a woman, thereforeto be won.

2171
02:38:53.530 --> 02:38:56.470
Wilt thou accept ofransom? yea, or no.

2172
02:38:56.470 --> 02:38:59.470
Fond man, remember thatthou hast a wife;

2173
02:38:59.470 --> 02:39:04.430
Then how can Margaret bethy paramour?

2174
02:39:04.430 --> 02:39:07.230
T'were best to leave him,for he will not hear.

2175
02:39:07.230 --> 02:39:10.630
There all is marr'd; therelies a cooling card.

2176
02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:13.270
He talks at random; sure,the man is mad.

2177
02:39:13.270 --> 02:39:15.330
And yet a dispensation maybe had.

2178
02:39:15.330 --> 02:39:17.630
And yet I would that youwould answer me.

2179
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:22.630
I'll win this LadyMargaret. For whom?

2180
02:39:22.630 --> 02:39:27.170
Why, for my king: tush,that's a wooden thing!

2181
02:39:27.170 --> 02:39:31.730
He talks of wood: it issome carpenter.

2182
02:39:31.730 --> 02:39:34.330
Yet so my fancy may besatisfied,

2183
02:39:34.330 --> 02:39:37.570
And peace establishedbetween these realms

2184
02:39:37.570 --> 02:39:39.070
But there remains ascruple in that too;

2185
02:39:39.070 --> 02:39:41.100
For though her father bethe King of Naples,

2186
02:39:41.100 --> 02:39:45.030
Duke of Anjou and Maine,yet is he poor,

2187
02:39:45.030 --> 02:39:46.830
And our nobility willscorn the match.

2188
02:39:46.830 --> 02:39:49.530
Hear ye, captain, are younot at leisure?

2189
02:39:49.530 --> 02:39:52.030
It shall be so, disdainthey ne'er so much.

2190
02:39:52.030 --> 02:39:55.700
Henry is youthful and willquickly yield.

2191
02:39:55.700 --> 02:40:01.500
Madam, I have a secret toreveal.

2192
02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:05.000
What though I be enthrall'd?he seems a knight,

2193
02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:06.900
And will not any waydishonour me.

2194
02:40:06.900 --> 02:40:08.570
Lady, vouchsafe to listenwhat I say.

2195
02:40:08.570 --> 02:40:10.370
Perhaps I shall be rescuedby the French;

2196
02:40:10.370 --> 02:40:12.870
And then I need not cravehis courtesy.

2197
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:14.470
Sweet madam, give me ahearing in a cause--

2198
02:40:14.470 --> 02:40:17.330
Tush, women have beencaptivate ere now.

2199
02:40:17.330 --> 02:40:18.770
Lady, wherefore talk youso?

2200
02:40:18.770 --> 02:40:28.170
I cry you mercy, 'tis butQuid for Quo.

2201
02:40:28.170 --> 02:40:31.800
Say, gentle princess,would you not suppose

2202
02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:38.630
Your bondage happy, to bemade a queen?

2203
02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:40.830
To be a queen in bondageis more vile

2204
02:40:40.830 --> 02:40:43.700
Than is a slave in baseservility;

2205
02:40:43.700 --> 02:40:46.430
For princes should befree.

2206
02:40:46.430 --> 02:40:48.670
And so shall you,

2207
02:40:48.670 --> 02:40:52.530
If happy England's royalking be free.

2208
02:40:52.530 --> 02:40:58.730
Why, what concerns hisfreedom unto me?

2209
02:40:58.730 --> 02:41:02.300
I'll undertake to makethee Henry's queen,

2210
02:41:02.300 --> 02:41:03.870
To put a golden sceptre inthy hand

2211
02:41:03.870 --> 02:41:06.730
And set a precious crownupon thy head,

2212
02:41:06.730 --> 02:41:13.400
If thou wilt condescend tobe my--

2213
02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:15.870
What?

2214
02:41:15.870 --> 02:41:21.300
His love.

2215
02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:23.970
I am unworthy to beHenry's wife.

2216
02:41:23.970 --> 02:41:25.700
No, gentle madam; Iunworthy am

2217
02:41:25.700 --> 02:41:29.000
To woo so fair a dame tobe his wife,

2218
02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:33.470
And have no portion in thechoice myself.

2219
02:41:33.470 --> 02:41:39.900
How say you, madam, are yeso content?

2220
02:41:39.900 --> 02:41:48.130
An if my father please, Iam content.

2221
02:41:48.130 --> 02:41:52.400
Then call our captains andour colours forth.

2222
02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:54.500
And, madam, at yourfather's castle walls

2223
02:41:54.500 --> 02:41:57.170
We'll crave a parley, toconfer with him.

2224
02:41:57.170 --> 02:42:02.170
(A parley sounded)

2225
02:42:03.870 --> 02:42:07.900
See, Reignier, see, thydaughter prisoner!

2226
02:42:07.900 --> 02:42:09.000
To whom?

2227
02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:10.100
To me.

2228
02:42:10.100 --> 02:42:12.300
Suffolk, what remedy?

2229
02:42:12.300 --> 02:42:13.800
I am a soldier, and unaptto weep,

2230
02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:15.970
Or to exclaim on fortune'sfickleness.

2231
02:42:15.970 --> 02:42:19.300
Yes, there is remedyenough, my lord:

2232
02:42:19.300 --> 02:42:24.170
Consent, and for thyhonour give consent,

2233
02:42:24.170 --> 02:42:28.200
Thy daughter shall bewedded to my king;

2234
02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:33.430
Whom I with pain havewoo'd and won thereto;

2235
02:42:33.430 --> 02:42:36.000
And this her easy-heldimprisonment

2236
02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:40.670
Hath gained thy daughterprincely liberty.

2237
02:42:40.670 --> 02:42:43.170
Speaks Suffolk as hethinks?

2238
02:42:43.170 --> 02:42:44.800
Fair Margaret knows

2239
02:42:44.800 --> 02:42:51.470
That Suffolk doth notflatter, face, or feign.

2240
02:42:51.470 --> 02:42:54.570
What answer makes yourgrace unto my suit?

2241
02:42:54.570 --> 02:42:58.270
Since thou dost deign towoo her little worth

2242
02:42:58.270 --> 02:43:01.730
To be the princely brideof such a lord;

2243
02:43:01.730 --> 02:43:04.670
Upon condition I mayquietly

2244
02:43:04.670 --> 02:43:07.370
Enjoy mine own, thecountry Maine and Anjou,

2245
02:43:07.370 --> 02:43:09.970
Free from oppression orthe stroke of war,

2246
02:43:09.970 --> 02:43:13.730
My daughter shall beHenry's, if he please.

2247
02:43:13.730 --> 02:43:16.500
That is her ransom; Ideliver her;

2248
02:43:16.500 --> 02:43:18.270
And those two counties Iwill undertake

2249
02:43:18.270 --> 02:43:21.230
Your grace shall well andquietly enjoy.

2250
02:43:21.230 --> 02:43:23.530
And I again, in Henry'sroyal name,

2251
02:43:23.530 --> 02:43:25.800
As deputy unto thatgracious king,

2252
02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:30.230
Give thee her hand, forsign of plighted faith.

2253
02:43:30.230 --> 02:43:34.800
Reignier of France, I givethee kingly thanks,

2254
02:43:34.800 --> 02:43:37.470
Because this is in trafficof a king.

2255
02:43:39.470 --> 02:43:41.530
And yet, methinks, I couldbe well content

2256
02:43:41.530 --> 02:43:44.700
To be mine own attorney inthis case.

2257
02:43:44.700 --> 02:43:46.230
I'll over then to Englandwith this news,

2258
02:43:46.230 --> 02:43:49.930
And make this marriage tobe solemnized.

2259
02:43:49.930 --> 02:43:53.830
So farewell, Reignier: setthis diamond safe

2260
02:43:53.830 --> 02:43:58.500
In golden palaces, as itbecomes.

2261
02:43:58.500 --> 02:44:04.300
I do embrace thee, as Iwould embrace

2262
02:44:04.300 --> 02:44:07.170
The Christian prince, KingHenry, were he here.

2263
02:44:07.170 --> 02:44:12.400
Farewell, my lord: goodwishes, praise and prayers

2264
02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:15.530
Shall Suffolk ever have ofMargaret.

2265
02:44:15.530 --> 02:44:22.930
Farewell, sweet maid: buthark you, Margaret;

2266
02:44:22.930 --> 02:44:26.770
No princely commendationsto my king?

2267
02:44:26.770 --> 02:44:29.870
Such commendations asbecomes a maid,

2268
02:44:29.870 --> 02:44:33.900
A virgin and his servant,say to him.

2269
02:44:33.900 --> 02:44:39.300
Words sweetly placed andmodestly directed.

2270
02:44:39.300 --> 02:44:43.100
But madam, I must troubleyou again;

2271
02:44:43.100 --> 02:44:46.130
No loving token to hismajesty?

2272
02:44:46.130 --> 02:44:52.700
Yes, my good lord, a pureunspotted heart,

2273
02:44:52.700 --> 02:44:58.230
Never yet taint with love,I send the king.

2274
02:44:58.230 --> 02:44:59.500
And this withal.

2275
02:45:07.830 --> 02:45:15.030
That for thyself: I willnot so presume

2276
02:45:15.030 --> 02:45:20.870
To send such peevishtokens to a king.

2277
02:45:28.570 --> 02:45:35.970
O, wert thou for myself!But, Suffolk, stay;

2278
02:45:35.970 --> 02:45:39.400
Thou mayst not wander inthat labyrinth;

2279
02:45:39.400 --> 02:45:44.630
There Minotaurs and uglytreasons lurk.

2280
02:45:44.630 --> 02:45:47.730
Solicit Henry with herwondrous praise:

2281
02:45:47.730 --> 02:45:50.170
Bethink thee on hervirtues that surmount,

2282
02:45:50.170 --> 02:45:53.500
And natural graces thatextinguish art;

2283
02:45:53.500 --> 02:45:55.800
Repeat their semblanceoften on the seas,

2284
02:45:55.800 --> 02:45:58.770
That, when thou comest tokneel at Henry's feet,

2285
02:45:58.770 --> 02:46:03.630
Thou mayst bereave him ofhis wits with wonder.

2286
02:46:08.530 --> 02:46:14.570
Bring forth that sorceresscondemn'd to burn.

2287
02:46:37.730 --> 02:46:45.130
Ah, Joan, this kills thyfather's heart outright!

2288
02:46:45.130 --> 02:46:47.630
Have I sought everycountry far and near,

2289
02:46:47.630 --> 02:46:50.530
And, now it is my chanceto find thee out,

2290
02:46:50.530 --> 02:46:53.830
Must I behold thy timelesscruel death?

2291
02:46:53.830 --> 02:46:59.030
Ah, Joan, sweet daughterJoan, I'll die with thee!

2292
02:46:59.030 --> 02:47:04.300
Decrepit miser! baseignoble wretch!

2293
02:47:04.300 --> 02:47:07.070
I am descended of agentler blood:

2294
02:47:07.070 --> 02:47:11.230
Thou art no father nor nofriend of mine.

2295
02:47:11.230 --> 02:47:17.300
Out, out! My lords, anplease you, 'tis not so;

2296
02:47:17.300 --> 02:47:19.500
I did beget her, all theparish knows:

2297
02:47:19.500 --> 02:47:21.900
Her mother liveth yet, cantestify

2298
02:47:21.900 --> 02:47:26.070
She was the first fruit ofmy bachelorship.

2299
02:47:26.070 --> 02:47:29.900
Graceless! wilt thou denythy parentage?

2300
02:47:29.900 --> 02:47:32.600
This argues what her kindof life hath been,

2301
02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:36.570
Wicked and vile; and soher death concludes.

2302
02:47:36.570 --> 02:47:40.400
Fie, Joan, that thou wiltbe so obstacle!

2303
02:47:40.400 --> 02:47:43.000
God knows thou art acollop of my flesh;

2304
02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.730
And for thy sake have Ished many a tear:

2305
02:47:45.730 --> 02:47:48.270
Deny me not, I prithee,gentle Joan.

2306
02:47:48.270 --> 02:47:52.170
Peasant, avaunt! You havesuborn'd this man,

2307
02:47:52.170 --> 02:47:55.830
Of purpose to obscure mynoble birth.

2308
02:47:55.830 --> 02:47:57.770
'Tis true, I gave a nobleto the priest

2309
02:47:57.770 --> 02:48:01.000
The morn that I was weddedto her mother.

2310
02:48:04.500 --> 02:48:11.400
Kneel down and take myblessing, good my girl.

2311
02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:15.200
Wilt thou not stoop? Nowcursed be the time

2312
02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:17.830
Of thy nativity! I wouldthe milk

2313
02:48:17.830 --> 02:48:19.900
Thy mother gave thee whenthou suck'dst her breast,

2314
02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:22.670
Had been a little ratsbanefor thy sake!

2315
02:48:22.670 --> 02:48:24.400
Or else, when thou didstkeep my lambs a-field,

2316
02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:27.570
I wish some ravenous wolfhad eaten thee!

2317
02:48:27.570 --> 02:48:32.230
Dost thou deny thy father,cursed drab?

2318
02:48:34.870 --> 02:48:40.500
O, burn her, burn her!hanging is too good.

2319
02:48:46.770 --> 02:48:49.000
Take her away; for shehath lived too long,

2320
02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:52.000
To fill the world withvicious qualities.

2321
02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:55.470
First, let me tell youwhom you have condemn'd:

2322
02:48:55.470 --> 02:48:58.870
Not me begotten of ashepherd swain,

2323
02:48:58.870 --> 02:49:01.870
But issued from theprogeny of kings;

2324
02:49:01.870 --> 02:49:05.430
Virtuous and holy; chosenfrom above,

2325
02:49:05.430 --> 02:49:08.170
By inspiration ofcelestial grace,

2326
02:49:08.170 --> 02:49:12.100
To work exceeding miracleson earth.

2327
02:49:12.100 --> 02:49:15.370
I never had to do withwicked spirits:

2328
02:49:15.370 --> 02:49:19.200
But you, that are pollutedwith your lusts,

2329
02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:22.770
Stain'd with the guiltlessblood of innocents,

2330
02:49:22.770 --> 02:49:25.570
Corrupt and tainted with athousand vices,

2331
02:49:25.570 --> 02:49:28.230
Because you want the gracethat others have,

2332
02:49:28.230 --> 02:49:29.600
You judge it straight athing impossible

2333
02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:33.770
To compass wonders but byhelp of devils.

2334
02:49:33.770 --> 02:49:37.400
No, misconceived! Joan ofArc hath been

2335
02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:40.600
A virgin from her tenderinfancy,

2336
02:49:40.600 --> 02:49:44.400
Chaste and immaculate invery thought;

2337
02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:47.730
Whose maiden blood, thusrigorously effused,

2338
02:49:47.730 --> 02:49:52.470
Will cry for vengeance atthe gates of heaven.

2339
02:49:52.470 --> 02:49:55.530
Ay, ay: away with her toexecution!

2340
02:49:55.530 --> 02:49:59.370
And hark ye, sirs; becauseshe is a maid,

2341
02:49:59.370 --> 02:50:02.330
Spare for no faggots, letthere be enow:

2342
02:50:02.330 --> 02:50:05.400
Place barrels of pitchupon the fatal stake,

2343
02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:07.230
That so her torture may beshortened.

2344
02:50:07.230 --> 02:50:10.000
Will nothing turn yourunrelenting hearts?

2345
02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.470
Then, Joan, discover thineinfirmity,

2346
02:50:12.470 --> 02:50:15.970
That warranteth by law tobe thy privilege.

2347
02:50:15.970 --> 02:50:20.130
I am with child, ye bloodyhomicides:

2348
02:50:20.130 --> 02:50:23.000
Murder not then the fruitwithin my womb,

2349
02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:26.630
Although ye hale me to aviolent death.

2350
02:50:26.630 --> 02:50:36.130
Now heaven forfend! theholy maid with child!

2351
02:50:36.130 --> 02:50:39.100
The greatest miracle thate'er ye wrought:

2352
02:50:39.100 --> 02:50:43.500
Is all your strictpreciseness come to this?

2353
02:50:43.500 --> 02:50:48.100
She and the Dauphin havebeen juggling:

2354
02:50:48.600 --> 02:50:50.100
I did imagine what wouldbe her refuge.

2355
02:50:50.100 --> 02:50:52.670
Well, go to; we'll have nobastards live;

2356
02:50:52.670 --> 02:50:55.530
Especially since Charlesmust father it.

2357
02:50:55.530 --> 02:50:58.270
You are deceived; my childis none of his:

2358
02:50:58.270 --> 02:51:01.100
It was Alencon thatenjoy'd my love.

2359
02:51:01.100 --> 02:51:05.830
Alencon! that notoriousMachiavel!

2360
02:51:05.830 --> 02:51:07.830
It dies, an if it had athousand lives.

2361
02:51:07.830 --> 02:51:09.370
O, give me leave, I havedeluded you:

2362
02:51:09.370 --> 02:51:13.270
'Twas neither Charles noryet the duke I named,

2363
02:51:13.270 --> 02:51:16.170
But Reignier, king ofNaples, that prevail'd.

2364
02:51:16.170 --> 02:51:19.530
A married man! that's mostintolerable.

2365
02:51:19.530 --> 02:51:24.770
Why, here's a girl! Ithink she knows not well,

2366
02:51:24.770 --> 02:51:29.100
There were so many, whomshe may accuse.

2367
02:51:29.100 --> 02:51:31.230
It's sign she hath beenliberal and free.

2368
02:51:31.230 --> 02:51:36.400
And yet, forsooth, she isa virgin pure.

2369
02:51:36.400 --> 02:51:42.630
Strumpet, thy wordscondemn thy brat and thee:

2370
02:51:42.630 --> 02:51:51.470
Use no entreaty, for it isin vain.

2371
02:51:51.470 --> 02:51:59.770
Then lead me hence; withwhom I leave my curse:

2372
02:51:59.770 --> 02:52:03.630
May never glorious sunreflex his beams

2373
02:52:03.630 --> 02:52:07.070
Upon the country where youmake abode;

2374
02:52:07.070 --> 02:52:10.800
But darkness and thegloomy shade of death

2375
02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:14.770
Environ you, till mischiefand despair

2376
02:52:14.770 --> 02:52:20.900
Drive you to break yournecks or hang yourselves!

2377
02:52:20.900 --> 02:52:25.170
Break thou in pieces andconsume to ashes,

2378
02:52:25.170 --> 02:52:28.270
Thou foul accursedminister of hell!

2379
02:52:28.270 --> 02:52:32.030
Lord regent, I do greetyour excellence

2380
02:52:32.030 --> 02:52:36.630
With letters of commissionfrom the king.

2381
02:52:36.630 --> 02:52:38.970
For know, my lords, thestates of Christendom,

2382
02:52:38.970 --> 02:52:43.030
Moved with remorse ofthese outrageous broils,

2383
02:52:43.030 --> 02:52:45.170
Have earnestly implored ageneral peace

2384
02:52:45.170 --> 02:52:49.670
Betwixt our nation and theaspiring French;

2385
02:52:49.670 --> 02:52:52.430
And here at hand theDauphin and his train

2386
02:52:52.430 --> 02:52:54.270
Approacheth, to conferabout some matter.

2387
02:53:02.800 --> 02:53:09.330
Is all our travail turn'dto this effect?

2388
02:53:09.330 --> 02:53:13.600
After the slaughter of somany peers,

2389
02:53:13.600 --> 02:53:17.730
So many captains,gentlemen and soldiers,

2390
02:53:17.730 --> 02:53:20.530
That in this quarrel havebeen overthrown

2391
02:53:20.530 --> 02:53:24.870
And sold their bodies fortheir country's benefit,

2392
02:53:24.870 --> 02:53:29.400
Shall we at last concludeeffeminate peace?

2393
02:53:31.870 --> 02:53:35.100
Have we not lost most partof all the towns,

2394
02:53:35.100 --> 02:53:38.370
By treason, falsehood andby treachery,

2395
02:53:38.370 --> 02:53:43.230
Our great progenitors hadconquered?

2396
02:53:43.230 --> 02:53:47.100
O Warwick, Warwick! Iforesee with grief

2397
02:53:47.100 --> 02:53:49.270
The utter loss of all therealm of France.

2398
02:53:49.270 --> 02:53:53.700
Be patient, York: if weconclude a peace,

2399
02:53:53.700 --> 02:53:57.170
It shall be with suchstrict and severe covenants

2400
02:53:57.170 --> 02:54:00.170
As little shall theFrenchmen gain thereby.

2401
02:54:17.730 --> 02:54:19.600
Since, lords of England,it is thus agreed

2402
02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:23.270
That peaceful truce shallbe proclaim'd in France,

2403
02:54:23.270 --> 02:54:25.270
We come to be informed byyourselves

2404
02:54:25.270 --> 02:54:29.600
What the conditions ofthat league must be.

2405
02:54:33.700 --> 02:54:39.130
Speak, Winchester; forboiling choler chokes

2406
02:54:39.130 --> 02:54:41.570
The hollow passage of mypoison'd voice,

2407
02:54:41.570 --> 02:54:48.400
By sight of these ourbaleful enemies.

2408
02:54:48.700 --> 02:54:52.470
Charles, and the rest, itis enacted thus:

2409
02:54:52.470 --> 02:54:54.170
That, in regard King Henrygives consent,

2410
02:54:54.170 --> 02:54:56.270
Of mere compassion and oflenity,

2411
02:54:56.270 --> 02:54:58.930
To ease your country ofdistressful war,

2412
02:54:58.930 --> 02:55:03.030
And suffer you to breathein fruitful peace,

2413
02:55:03.030 --> 02:55:07.870
You shall become trueliegemen to his crown:

2414
02:55:07.870 --> 02:55:09.630
And Charles, uponcondition thou wilt swear

2415
02:55:09.630 --> 02:55:12.230
To pay him tribute, submitthyself,

2416
02:55:12.230 --> 02:55:15.900
Thou shalt be placed asviceroy under him,

2417
02:55:15.900 --> 02:55:18.670
And still enjoy thy regaldignity.

2418
02:55:20.270 --> 02:55:25.670
Must he be then as shadowof himself?

2419
02:55:25.670 --> 02:55:28.700
Adorn his temples with acoronet,

2420
02:55:28.700 --> 02:55:32.600
And yet, in substance andauthority,

2421
02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:36.200
Retain but privilege of aprivate man?

2422
02:55:37.470 --> 02:55:44.930
This proffer is absurd andreasonless.

2423
02:55:44.930 --> 02:55:46.930
'Tis known already that Iam possess'd

2424
02:55:46.930 --> 02:55:48.900
With more than half theGallian territories,

2425
02:55:48.900 --> 02:55:52.030
And therein reverenced fortheir lawful king:

2426
02:55:52.030 --> 02:55:54.000
Shall I, for lucre of therest unvanquish'd,

2427
02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:55.470
Detract so much from thatprerogative,

2428
02:55:55.470 --> 02:56:00.870
As to be call'd butviceroy of the whole?

2429
02:56:00.870 --> 02:56:02.630
No, lord ambassador, I'llrather keep

2430
02:56:02.630 --> 02:56:04.700
That which I have than,coveting for more,

2431
02:56:04.700 --> 02:56:07.970
Be cast from possibilityof all.

2432
02:56:07.970 --> 02:56:18.900
Insulting Charles! hastthou by secret means

2433
02:56:18.900 --> 02:56:22.970
Used intercession toobtain a league,

2434
02:56:22.970 --> 02:56:25.970
And, now the matter growsto compromise,

2435
02:56:25.970 --> 02:56:29.530
Stand'st thou aloof uponcomparison?

2436
02:56:29.830 --> 02:56:33.200
Either accept the titlethou usurp'st,

2437
02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:36.330
Of benefit proceeding fromour king

2438
02:56:36.330 --> 02:56:41.330
And not of any challengeof desert,

2439
02:56:41.330 --> 02:56:49.930
Or we will plague theewith incessant wars.

2440
02:56:52.730 --> 02:56:55.130
My lord, you do not wellin obstinacy

2441
02:56:55.130 --> 02:56:57.630
To cavil in the course ofthis contract:

2442
02:56:57.630 --> 02:56:59.100
If once it be neglected,ten to one

2443
02:56:59.100 --> 02:57:01.270
We shall not find likeopportunity.

2444
02:57:01.270 --> 02:57:03.230
To say the truth, it isyour policy

2445
02:57:03.230 --> 02:57:05.100
To save your subjects fromsuch massacre

2446
02:57:05.100 --> 02:57:07.670
And ruthless slaughters asare daily seen

2447
02:57:07.670 --> 02:57:09.130
By our proceeding inhostility;

2448
02:57:09.130 --> 02:57:13.400
And therefore take thiscompact of a truce,

2449
02:57:13.400 --> 02:57:18.870
Although you break it whenyour pleasure serves.

2450
02:57:18.870 --> 02:57:22.800
How say'st thou, Charles?shall our condition stand?

2451
02:57:25.070 --> 02:57:26.670
It shall;

2452
02:57:26.670 --> 02:57:28.070
Only reserved, you claimno interest

2453
02:57:28.070 --> 02:57:31.600
In any of our towns ofgarrison.

2454
02:57:41.530 --> 02:57:46.500
Then swear allegiance tohis majesty,

2455
02:58:00.430 --> 02:58:05.330
As thou art knight, neverto disobey

2456
02:58:05.330 --> 02:58:10.000
Nor be rebellious to thecrown of England,

2457
02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:23.470
Thou, nor thy nobles, tothe crown of England.

2458
02:58:31.470 --> 02:58:39.500
So, now dismiss your armywhen ye please:

2459
02:58:39.500 --> 02:58:44.070
Hang up your ensign, letyour drums be still,

2460
02:58:44.070 --> 02:58:49.630
For here we entertain asolemn peace.

2461
02:58:50.770 --> 02:58:52.900
Your wondrous raredescription, noble earl,

2462
02:58:52.900 --> 02:58:55.570
Of beauteous Margaret hathastonish'd me:

2463
02:58:55.570 --> 02:58:57.570
Her virtues graced withexternal gifts

2464
02:58:57.570 --> 02:59:00.400
Do breed love's settledpassions in my heart:

2465
02:59:00.400 --> 02:59:03.270
And like as rigor oftempestuous gusts

2466
02:59:03.270 --> 02:59:06.200
Provokes the mightiesthulk against the tide,

2467
02:59:06.200 --> 02:59:08.530
So am I driven by breathof her renown

2468
02:59:08.530 --> 02:59:10.600
Either to suffer shipwreckor arrive

2469
02:59:10.600 --> 02:59:12.930
Where I may have fruitionof her love.

2470
02:59:12.930 --> 02:59:15.630
Tush, my good lord, thissuperficial tale

2471
02:59:15.630 --> 02:59:18.470
Is but a preface of herworthy praise;

2472
02:59:18.470 --> 02:59:21.170
And, which is more, she isnot so divine,

2473
02:59:21.170 --> 02:59:24.170
So full-replete withchoice of all delights,

2474
02:59:24.170 --> 02:59:26.500
But with as humblelowliness of mind

2475
02:59:26.500 --> 02:59:30.530
She is content to be atyour command;

2476
02:59:30.530 --> 02:59:34.100
Command, I mean, ofvirtuous chaste intents,

2477
02:59:34.100 --> 02:59:37.500
To love and honour Henryas her lord.

2478
02:59:37.500 --> 02:59:40.400
And otherwise will Henryne'er presume.

2479
02:59:40.400 --> 02:59:43.430
Therefore, my lordprotector, give consent

2480
02:59:43.430 --> 02:59:48.530
That Margaret may beEngland's royal queen.

2481
02:59:48.530 --> 02:59:52.500
So should I give consentto flatter sin.

2482
02:59:52.500 --> 02:59:54.300
You know, yourhighness is betroth'd

2483
02:59:54.300 --> 02:59:56.730
Unto another lady ofesteem:

2484
02:59:56.730 --> 02:59:59.230
How shall we then dispensewith that contract,

2485
02:59:59.230 --> 03:00:03.000
And not deface your honourwith reproach?

2486
03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:06.170
As doth a ruler withunlawful oaths;

2487
03:00:06.170 --> 03:00:09.200
Or one that, at a triumphhaving vow'd

2488
03:00:09.200 --> 03:00:10.600
To try his strength,forsaketh yet the lists

2489
03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:13.370
By reason of hisadversary's odds:

2490
03:00:13.370 --> 03:00:16.500
A poor earl's daughter isunequal odds,

2491
03:00:16.500 --> 03:00:19.530
And therefore may be brokewithout offence.

2492
03:00:19.530 --> 03:00:22.770
Why, what, I pray, isMargaret more than that?

2493
03:00:22.770 --> 03:00:24.970
Her father is no betterthan an earl,

2494
03:00:24.970 --> 03:00:27.330
Although in glorioustitles he excel.

2495
03:00:27.330 --> 03:00:30.030
Yes, lord, her father is aking,

2496
03:00:30.030 --> 03:00:31.570
The King of Naples andJerusalem;

2497
03:00:31.570 --> 03:00:32.970
(laughing)

2498
03:00:32.970 --> 03:00:35.100
And of such greatauthority in France

2499
03:00:35.100 --> 03:00:37.530
As his alliance willconfirm our peace

2500
03:00:37.530 --> 03:00:39.930
And keep the Frenchmen inallegiance.

2501
03:00:39.930 --> 03:00:42.000
And so the Earl ofArmagnac may do,

2502
03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:44.570
Because he is near kinsmanunto Charles.

2503
03:00:44.570 --> 03:00:46.230
Beside, his wealth dothwarrant a liberal dower,

2504
03:00:46.230 --> 03:00:49.600
Where Reignier sooner willreceive than give.

2505
03:00:49.600 --> 03:00:53.830
A dower, my lords!disgrace not so your king,

2506
03:00:53.830 --> 03:00:56.370
That he should be soabject, base and poor,

2507
03:00:56.370 --> 03:01:00.200
To choose for wealth andnot for perfect love.

2508
03:01:02.170 --> 03:01:05.130
Henry is able to enrichhis queen

2509
03:01:05.130 --> 03:01:07.800
And not seek a queen tomake him rich:

2510
03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:10.570
So worthless peasantsbargain for their wives,

2511
03:01:10.570 --> 03:01:12.930
As market-men for oxen,sheep, or horse.

2512
03:01:12.930 --> 03:01:14.730
Marriage is a matter ofmore worth

2513
03:01:14.730 --> 03:01:17.900
Than to be dealt in byattorneyship;

2514
03:01:17.900 --> 03:01:20.870
Not whom we will, but whomhis grace affects,

2515
03:01:20.870 --> 03:01:23.200
Must be companion of hisnuptial bed:

2516
03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:26.200
For what is wedlock forcedbut a hell,

2517
03:01:26.200 --> 03:01:29.230
An age of discord andcontinual strife?

2518
03:01:29.230 --> 03:01:31.370
Whereas the contrarybringeth bliss,

2519
03:01:31.370 --> 03:01:34.270
And is a pattern ofcelestial peace.

2520
03:01:34.270 --> 03:01:36.830
Whom should we match withHenry, being a king,

2521
03:01:36.830 --> 03:01:40.070
But Margaret, that isdaughter to a king?

2522
03:01:40.070 --> 03:01:42.570
Her peerless feature,joined with her birth,

2523
03:01:42.570 --> 03:01:47.070
Approves her fit for nonebut for a king:

2524
03:01:48.070 --> 03:01:50.330
Her valiant courage andundaunted spirit,

2525
03:01:50.330 --> 03:01:51.870
More than in womencommonly is seen,

2526
03:01:51.870 --> 03:01:54.200
Will answer our hope inissue of a king;

2527
03:01:54.200 --> 03:01:57.000
For Henry, son unto aconqueror,

2528
03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.530
Is likely to beget moreconquerors,

2529
03:01:59.530 --> 03:02:01.600
If with a lady of so highresolve

2530
03:02:01.600 --> 03:02:04.400
As is fair Margaret he belink'd in love.

2531
03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:07.600
Then yield, my lords; andhere conclude with me

2532
03:02:07.600 --> 03:02:12.070
That Margaret shall bequeen, and none but she.

2533
03:02:12.070 --> 03:02:13.270
Whether it be throughforce of your report,

2534
03:02:13.270 --> 03:02:15.000
My noble Lord of Suffolk,or for that

2535
03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:16.230
My tender youth was neveryet attaint

2536
03:02:16.230 --> 03:02:18.270
With any passion ofinflaming love,

2537
03:02:18.270 --> 03:02:21.170
I cannot tell; but this Iam assured,

2538
03:02:21.170 --> 03:02:23.100
I feel such sharpdissension in my breast,

2539
03:02:23.100 --> 03:02:26.530
Such fierce alarums bothof hope and fear,

2540
03:02:26.530 --> 03:02:29.500
As I am sick with workingof my thoughts.

2541
03:02:29.500 --> 03:02:32.130
Take, therefore, shipping;post, my lord, to France;

2542
03:02:32.130 --> 03:02:33.800
Agree to any covenants,and procure

2543
03:02:33.800 --> 03:02:35.430
That Lady Margaret dovouchsafe to come

2544
03:02:35.430 --> 03:02:37.030
To cross the seas toEngland and be crown'd

2545
03:02:37.030 --> 03:02:40.030
King Henry's faithful andanointed queen:

2546
03:02:40.030 --> 03:02:42.170
For your expenses andsufficient charge,

2547
03:02:42.170 --> 03:02:44.470
Among the people gather upa tenth.

2548
03:02:44.470 --> 03:02:46.730
Be gone, I say; for, tillyou do return,

2549
03:02:46.730 --> 03:02:52.330
I rest perplexed with athousand cares.

2550
03:02:57.470 --> 03:03:06.430
And you, good uncle,banish all offence:

2551
03:03:06.430 --> 03:03:09.500
If you do censure me bywhat you were,

2552
03:03:09.500 --> 03:03:12.670
Not what you are, I knowit will excuse

2553
03:03:12.670 --> 03:03:18.870
This sudden execution ofmy will.

2554
03:03:18.870 --> 03:03:24.030
And so, conduct me where,from company,

2555
03:03:24.030 --> 03:03:28.930
I may revolve and ruminatemy grief.

2556
03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:45.430
Ay, grief, I fear me, bothat first and last.

2557
03:03:53.330 --> 03:03:57.830
Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd;and thus he goes,

2558
03:03:57.830 --> 03:04:00.400
As did the youthful Parisonce to Greece,

2559
03:04:00.400 --> 03:04:04.200
With hope to find the likeevent in love,

2560
03:04:04.200 --> 03:04:08.430
But prosper better thanthe Trojan did.

2561
03:04:08.430 --> 03:04:14.030
Margaret shall now bequeen, and rule the king;

2562
03:04:14.030 --> 03:04:22.670
But I will rule both her,the king and realm.

2563
03:07:14.930 --> 03:07:15.930


2564
03:07:16.500 --> 03:07:19.500
