SPECIES OF SCIENTIST THAT I

REFER TO AS BEING
NATURALLY OBSESSED.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.260

ANXIETY THAT YOU HAVE THAT CAN

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.430
ONLY BE SUPPLIED BY KNOWING.

ILL BE ABLE TO ASK.

Second man: ITS LIKE
A CHALLENGE EVERY DAY.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.000
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY THIS
WORKS OR HOW THIS WORKS.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.060
YOURE JUST DRIVEN TO FIND OUT.

Third man: ONE OF THE
BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO AS

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.760
A SCIENTIST IS SUFFER FROM
OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.530
SO THAT YOU BECOME OBSESSED
WITH A PROBLEM AND CANT STOP

00:00:36.530 --> 00:01:10.630
WORKING ON IT UNTIL
YOU GET TO YOUR ANSWER.

"THESE PEOPLE COULDNT GET
THEIR PROTEIN TO CRYSTALLIZE,"

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.100

HAVE ARE THESE EXPERIMENTS."

GET EXCITED ABOUT THEM

TAKES TO DO THIS AND THAT
THERE ARE SO MANY FAILURES

BEFORE ONE GETS TO A SUCCESS.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.100

TO DO SCIENCE--AND WERE
TRYING TO TRAIN INDEPENDENT

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:50.430

LEARN TO BECOME INDEPENDENT
