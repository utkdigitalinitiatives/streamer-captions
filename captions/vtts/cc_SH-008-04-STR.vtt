00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.170


2
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.470
Now, lords, if God doth give successful end

3
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.400
to this debate that bleedeth at our doors,

4
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.170
we will our youth lead on to higher fields

5
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.430
and draw no swords but what are sanctified.

6
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.270
Our navy is addressed, our power collected,

7
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.070
our substitutes in absence well invested,

8
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.370
and everything lies level to our wish.

9
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.900
Only, we lack a little personal strength;

10
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.370
and pause us till these rebels, now afoot,

11
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.930
come underneath the yoke of government.

12
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.730
Of both which we doubt not but Your Majesty shall soon enjoy.

13
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.070
Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,

14
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.670
where is the prince your brother?

15
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.200
I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.

16
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.270
And how accompanied?

17
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.500
I do not know, my lord.

18
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.130
Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?

19
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.000
No, my good lord; he is in presence here.

20
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.370
What would my lord and father?

21
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.300
Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.

22
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.030
How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?

23
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.800
He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas.

24
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.470
Thou hast a better part in his affection

25
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.770
than all thy brothers.

26
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.230
Cherish it, my boy,

27
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.030
and noble offices thou mayst effect of mediation,

28
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.630
after I am dead,

29
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.200
between his greatness and thy other brethren.

30
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.770
Therefore omit him not.

31
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.800
Blunt not his love, nor lose the good advantage of His Grace

32
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.230
by seeming cold or careless of his will,

33
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.630
for he is gracious, if he be observed.

34
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.630
He hath a tear for pity

35
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.970
and a hand open as day for melting charity.

36
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.830
Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint,

37
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.970
as humorous as winter

38
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.130
and as sudden as flaws congealed in the spring of day.

39
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.430
His temper, therefore, must be well observed.

40
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.570
Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,

41
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.530
when you perceive his blood inclined to mirth.

42
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.500
But, being moody, give him line and scope,

43
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.300
till that his passions, like a whale on ground,

44
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.230
confound themselves with working.

45
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.730
Learn this, Thomas,

46
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.800
and thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,

47
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.500
a hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,

48
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.930
that the united vessel of their blood,

49
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.130
mingled with venom of suggestionó

50
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.970
As, force perforce, the age will pour it inó

51
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.700
shall never leak, though it do work as strong

52
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.030
as aconitum or more rash gunpowder.

53
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.030
I shall observe him with all care and love.

54
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.600
Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?

55
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.370
He is not there today.

56
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.470
He dines in London.

57
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.430
And how accompanied?

58
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.900
Canst thou tell that?

59
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.730
With Poins and other his continual followers.

60
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.400
Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds.

61
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.700
And he, the noble image of my youth, is overspread with them.

62
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.730
Therefore my grief stretches itself beyond the hour of death.

63
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.730
The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape

64
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.330
in forms imaginary the unguided days

65
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.830
and rotten times that you shall look upon

66
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.430
when I am sleeping with my ancestors.

67
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.700
For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,

68
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.070
when rage and hot blood are his counselors,

69
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.970
when means and lavish manners meet together,

70
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.870
oh, with what wings shall his affections fly

71
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.470
to fronting peril and opposed decay.

72
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.700
My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite.

73
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.300
The prince but studies his companions

74
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.730
like a strange tongue, wherein, to learn the language.

75
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.370
'Tis necessary that the most immodest words

76
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.270
be looked upon and learnt,

77
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.230
which once attained, Your Highness knows,

78
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.270
comes to no further use but to be known and hated.

79
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.530
So like gross terms, the prince will in the perfectness of time

80
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.670
cast off his followers.

81
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.670
And their memory shall as a pattern or a measure live,

82
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.830
by which His Grace must mete the lives of others,

83
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.800
turning past evils to advantages.

84
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.230
'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb

85
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.370
in the dead carrion.

86
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.670
Who's here?

87
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.700
Westmoreland?

88
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.670
Health to my sovereign,

89
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.100
and new happiness added to that that I am to deliver.

90
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.700
Prince John your son doth kiss Your Grace's hand.

91
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.470
Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings, and all

92
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.970
are brought to the correction of your law.

93
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.530
There is not now a rebel's sword unsheathed,

94
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.370
but peace puts forth her olive everywhere.

95
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.770
Oh, Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,

96
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.170
which ever in the haunch of winter sings

97
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.770
the lifting up of day.

98
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.430
And there's more news.

99
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.470
The earl Northumberland and the lord Bardolph,

100
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.100
with a great power of English and of Scots,

101
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.800
are by the shrieve of Yorkshire overthrown.

102
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:13.070
And wherefore should these good news make me sick?

103
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.670
Will fortune never come with both hands full,

104
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:24.300
but write her fair words still in foulest letters?

105
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.730
She either gives a stomach and no food.

106
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.570
Such are the poor in health.

107
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.870
Or else a feast and takes away the stomach.

108
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.100
Such are the rich that have abundance and enjoy it not.

109
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.830
I should rejoice now at this happy news.

110
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:54.670
And now my sight fails and my brain is giddy.

111
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:55.670
Oh, me.

112
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.670
Come near me.

113
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.700
Now I am much ill.

114
00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.970
Comfort, Your Majesty.

115
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.170
Oh, my royal father.

116
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.300
My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself,

117
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:02.970
Look up.

118
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:04.400
Be patient, princes.

119
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.130
You do know, these fits are with His Highness very ordinary.

120
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.130
Stand from him.

121
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.270
Give him air.

122
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.330
He'll straight be well.

123
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.370
No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs.

124
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.370
The incessant care and labor of his mind

125
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.170
hath wrought the mure that should confine it in

126
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.430
so thin that life looks through and will break out.

127
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.530
This apoplexy will certain be his end.

128
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.230
Softly, pray.

129
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.100
Who saw the duke of Clarence?

130
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.070
I am here, brother, full of heaviness.

131
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.070
How now.

132
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.700
Rain within doors and none abroad.

133
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.470
How doth the king?

134
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.070
Exceeding ill.

135
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.230
Heard he the good news yet?

136
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.230
Tell it him.

137
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.270
He altered much upon the hearing it.

138
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.130
If he be sick with joy, he'll recover without physic.

139
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.170
Not so much noise, my lords.

140
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.370
Sweet prince, speak low.

141
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.700
The king your father is disposed to sleep.

142
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.170
Let us withdraw into the other room.

143
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.900
Please it Your Grace to go along with us?

144
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.700
No, I will sit and watch here by the king.

145
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.230
Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,

146
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.800
being so troublesome a bedfellow?

147
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.670
Oh, polished perturbation.

148
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.100
Golden care.

149
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.800
It keeps the ports of slumber open wide

150
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.570
to many a watchful night.

151
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.770
Sleep with it nowó

152
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.170
yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet

153
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.970
as he whose brow with homely biggen bound

154
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:27.600
snores out the watch of night.

155
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.430
Oh, majesty,

156
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.570
when thou dost pinch thy bearer,

157
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:42.030
thou dost sit like a rich armor worn in heat of day

158
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.930
that scalds with safety.

159
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.900
By his gates of breath

160
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.900
there lies a downy feather which stirs not.

161
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.230
Did he suspire,

162
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.530
that light and weightless down perforce must move.

163
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.000
My gracious lord?

164
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.070
My father?

165
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.930
This sleep is sound indeed.

166
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.070
This is a sleep that from this golden rigol

167
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.000
hath divorced so many English kings.

168
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:36.470
Thy due from me is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,

169
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:44.500
which nature, love, and filial tenderness,

170
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:53.230
shall, oh, dear Father, pay thee plenteously.

171
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.370
My due from thee is this imperial crown,

172
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.630
which, as immediate as thy place and blood,

173
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.700
derives itself to me.

174
00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.130
Lo, where it sits, which God shall guard.

175
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:54.630
And put the world's whole strength into one giant arm,

176
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.670
it shall not force this lineal honor from me.

177
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:07.800
This from thee will I to mine leave, as 'tis left to me.

178
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.730
Warwick.

179
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.100
Gloucester and Clarence.

180
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.270
Doth the king call?

181
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:38.670
What would Your Majesty?

182
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.670
How fares my lord?

183
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.270
Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?

184
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.400
We left the prince my brother here, my liege,

185
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.430
who undertook to sit and watch by you.

186
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.100
The Prince of Wales?

187
00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.630
Where is he?

188
00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.630
Find him.

189
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.700
He is not here.

190
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.100
The door is open.

191
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.530
He is gone this way.

192
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.670
He came not through the chamber where we stayed.

193
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.170
Where is the crown?

194
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.770
Who took it from my pillow?

195
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.200
When we withdrew, my lord, we left it there.

196
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.100
The prince hath ta'en it hence.

197
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.900
Go seek him out.

198
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:30.870
Is he so hasty that he doth suppose my sleep my death?

199
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.770
Find him, my lord of Warwick.

200
00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.230
Chide him hither.

201
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.900
This part of his conjoins with my disease

202
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.330
and helps to end me.

203
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.430
See, sons, what things you are.

204
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.500
How quickly nature falls into revolt

205
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.130
when gold becomes her object.

206
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:04.030
For this the foolish, overcareful fathers

207
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:07.000
have broke their sleep with thoughts,

208
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.700
their brains with care, their bones with industry.

209
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.330
For this they have been thoughtful to invest

210
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.270
their sons with arts and martial exercises.

211
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.670
When, like the bee,

212
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.230
culling from every flower the virtuous sweets,

213
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:30.930
our thighs with wax, our mouths with honey packed,

214
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:35.130
we bring it to the hive, and, like the bees,

215
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.770
are murdered for our pains.

216
00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.900
This bitter taste.

217
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.930
But wherefore did he take away the crown?

218
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.100
Lo, where he comes.

219
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.470
Come hither to me, Harry.

220
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:00.930
Depart the chamber.

221
00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:01.970
Leave us here alone.

222
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.500
I never thought to hear you speak again.

223
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:23.200
Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought.

224
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.930
I stay too long by thee.

225
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:31.330
I weary thee.

226
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:35.700
Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair

227
00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:40.130
that thou wilt needs invest thee with my honors

228
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.130
before thy hour be ripe?

229
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.070
Oh, foolish youth.

230
00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:53.200
Thou seek'st the greatness that will overwhelm thee.

231
00:16:54.770 --> 00:17:00.130
Stay but a little, for my cloud of dignity

232
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.400
is held from falling with so weak a wind

233
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.030
that it will quickly drop.

234
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.870
My day is dim.

235
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:16.770
Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours

236
00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:21.000
were thine without offence.

237
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.700
And at my death thou hast sealed up my expectation.

238
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.530
Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,

239
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:33.300
and thou wilt have me die assured of it.

240
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:41.370
What canst thou not forbear me half an hour?

241
00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:47.100
Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,

242
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:51.300
and bid the merry bells ring to thine ear

243
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.170
that thou art crowned, not that I am dead.

244
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.930
Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse

245
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:04.400
be drops of balm to sanctify thy head.

246
00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:10.170
Only compound me with forgotten dust.

247
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:16.400
Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.

248
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.270
Pluck down my officers, break my decrees,

249
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.700
for now a time is come to mock at form.

250
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.100
Harry V is crowned

251
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.470
Up, vanity.

252
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.200
Down, royal state.

253
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.800
All you sage counselors, hence.

254
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.670
And to the English court assemble now,

255
00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:48.800
from every region, apes of idleness.

256
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.970
For the fifth Harry

257
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.900
from curbed license plucks the muzzle of restraint,

258
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:59.870
and the wild dog shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.

259
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:08.970
Oh, my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows.

260
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:12.570
When that my care could not withhold thy riots,

261
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.970
what wilt thou do when riot is thy care?

262
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.270
Oh, thou wilt be a wilderness again,

263
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.570
peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants.

264
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.900
Oh, pardon me, my liege.

265
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.270
But for my tears, the moist impediments unto my speech,

266
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:37.430
I had forestalled this dear and deep rebuke

267
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:38.870
ere you with grief had spoke

268
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.300
and I had heard the course of it so far.

269
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:44.930
There is your crown,

270
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:48.070
and he that wears the crown immortally long guard it yours.

271
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:57.530
If I affect it more than as your honor and as your renown,

272
00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.230
let me no more from this obedience rise,

273
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:06.330
which my most inward, true, and duteous spirit teacheth,

274
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.670
this prostrate and exterior bending.

275
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.370
God witness with me, when I here came in

276
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.470
and found no course of breath within Your Majesty,

277
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.330
how cold it struck my heart.

278
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:24.100
If I do feign, oh, let me in my present wildness die

279
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.230
and never live to show the incredulous world

280
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.470
the noble change that I have purposed.

281
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.400
Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,

282
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.300
and dead almost, my liege, to think you were,

283
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.070
I spake unto this crown as having sense

284
00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.400
and thus upbraided it.

285
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:51.170
"The care on thee depending hath fed upon the body of my father.

286
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:56.630
"Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold.

287
00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.470
"Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,

288
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.830
"preserving life in medicine potable.

289
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:09.200
"But thou, most fine, most honored, most renowned,

290
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.270
hast eat thy bearer up."

291
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.900
Thus, my most royal liege, accusing it,

292
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.330
I put it on my head,

293
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.100
to try with it as with an enemy

294
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.330
that had before my face murdered my father.

295
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.000
The quarrel of a true inheritor.

296
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:39.630
But if it did infect my blood with joy

297
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.370
or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride,

298
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.800
if any rebel or vain spirit of mine

299
00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.470
did with the least affection of a welcome

300
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:50.200
give entertainment to the might of it,

301
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.900
let God forever keep it from my head

302
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.170
make me as the poorest vassal is

303
00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.000
that doth with awe and terror kneel to it.

304
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:04.530
Oh, my son,

305
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:12.630
God put it in thy mind to take it hence

306
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:16.970
that thou mightst win the more thy father's love,

307
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:20.500
pleading so wisely in excuse of it.

308
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.270
Come hither, Harry.

309
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:37.170
Sit thou by my bed and hear, I think, the very latest counsel

310
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.500
that ever I shall breathe.

311
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.170
God knows, my son,

312
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:55.070
by what bypaths and indirect, crooked ways I met this crown;

313
00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.900
and I myself know well how troublesome it sat upon my head.

314
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:07.470
To thee it shall descend with better quiet,

315
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:11.400
better opinion, better confirmation,

316
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.030
for all the soil of the achievement

317
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.530
goes with me into the earth.

318
00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:26.500
It seemed in me but as an honor snatched with boisterous hand,

319
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.070
and I had many living

320
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:32.300
to upbraid my gain of it by their assistances,

321
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.300
which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,

322
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.300
wounding supposed peace.

323
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:46.030
All these bold fears thou see'st with peril I have answered,

324
00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:50.800
for all my reign hath been but as a scene acting that argument.

325
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:56.070
And now my death changes the mood.

326
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:01.900
For what in me was purchased

327
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:06.200
falls upon thee in a more fairer sort,

328
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.600
so thou the garland wear'st successively.

329
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:16.030
Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,

330
00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:20.470
thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green.

331
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:24.330
And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,

332
00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.230
have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out,

333
00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:32.000
by whose fell working I was first advanced

334
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.570
and by whose power I well might lodge a fear

335
00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:38.000
to be again displaced,

336
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.500
which to avoid, I cut them off,

337
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:49.470
and had a purpose now to lead out many to the Holy Land,

338
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:53.330
lest rest and lying still might make them look

339
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.330
too near unto my state.

340
00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:04.130
Therefore, my Harry, be it thy course to busy giddy minds

341
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.430
with foreign quarrels.

342
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:09.030
That action, hence borne out,

343
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:12.030
may waste the memory of the former days.

344
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:30.670
More would I, but my lungs are wasted

345
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:36.630
so that strength of speech is utterly denied me.

346
00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:47.570
How I came by the crown, oh, God forgive;

347
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:54.000
and grant it may with thee in true peace live.

348
00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:57.970
My gracious liege,

349
00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:07.330
you won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me.

350
00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:11.430
Then plain and right must my possession be,

351
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:15.130
which I with more than with a common pain

352
00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:19.470
'gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.

353
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.470
Doth any name particular

354
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:32.500
belong unto the lodging where I first did swoon?

355
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.870
'Tis called Jerusalem, my noble lord.

356
00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:40.200
Laud be to God.

357
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.430
Even there my life must end.

358
00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:50.170
It hath been prophesied to me many years,

359
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:53.430
I should not die but in Jerusalem,

360
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:59.400
which vainly I supposed the Holy Land.

361
00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.570
But bear me to that chamber.

362
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.670
There I'll lie.

363
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:13.970
In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.

364
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:23.970
By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away tonight.

365
00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.130
What, Davy, I say.

366
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.670
You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.

367
00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:31.730
I will not excuse you; you shall not be excused.

368
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.530
Excuses shall not be admitted.

369
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:35.370
There is no excuse shall serve.

370
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.030
You shall not be excused.

371
00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.030
Why, Davy, Ió

372
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.500
Here, sir.

373
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.530
Davy, Davy, Davy,let me see, Davy.

374
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:43.700
Let me see.

375
00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.730
Ah, marry, William cook, bid him come hither.

376
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:49.100
Sir John, you shall not be excused.

377
00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.670
Marry, sir, thus,

378
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:54.070
those precepts cannot be served, and, again, sir,

379
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:56.470
shall we sow the headland with wheat?

380
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.030
With red wheat, Davy.

381
00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:01.000
But for William cook, have we no young pigeons?

382
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.830
Yes, sir.

383
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:06.200
Sir, here is now the smith's note

384
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.770
for shoeing and plough irons.

385
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.000
Well, let it be cast and paid.

386
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.800
Sir John, you shall not be excused.

387
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.470
Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must needs be had.

388
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:20.170
And, sir, do you mean to stop any of William's wages

389
00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:23.630
about the sack he lost the other day at Hinckley fair?

390
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:25.200
A' shall answer it.

391
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:31.170
Let him cook some pigeons, Davy, a couple of short-legged hens,

392
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.200
some  joint of mutton,

393
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.230
and some, any pretty, little, tiny kickshaws;

394
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:38.770
tell William cook.

395
00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:41.470
Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?

396
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:43.470
Yea, I will use him well, Davy.

397
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:46.330
A friend at court is better than a penny in purse.

398
00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.530
And for his men, use them well,

399
00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:51.870
for they are arrant knaves and will backbite.

400
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.630
No worse than they are backbitten,

401
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.330
for they have marvelous foul linen.

402
00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:58.170
Well conceited, Davy.

403
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.170
About thy business, Davy.

404
00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.170
Where are you, Sir John?

405
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.170
Come, come, come.

406
00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:04.100
Off with your boots.

407
00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.900
Give me your hand, good Master Bardolph.

408
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.670
By Your Worship.

409
00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:09.330
I thank thee from my heart.

410
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:11.030
And welcome, my tall fellow.

411
00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.600
Come, Sir John.

412
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.830
Come, Sir John.

413
00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:17.430
I'll follow you, Master Robert Shallow.

414
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:18.430
Bardolph.

415
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:19.430
What?

416
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:20.470
Look to our horses.

417
00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:28.130
If I were sawed into quantities,

418
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:30.930
I should make four dozen of such bearded hermits' staves

419
00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:31.970
as Master Shallow.

420
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:37.870
It's a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence

421
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:40.730
of his men's spirits and his.

422
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.470
They, by observing of him,

423
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:45.430
do bear themselves like foolish justices.

424
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:46.830
He, by conversing with them,

425
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:50.470
is turned into a justice-like servingman.

426
00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:53.270
It's certain that either wise bearing

427
00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.130
or ignorant carriage is caught,

428
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.570
as men take diseases, one of another.

429
00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:00.330
Therefore let men take heed of the company they keep.

430
00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:09.870
I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow

431
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:13.600
to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter.

432
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:20.570
Oh, you shall see him laugh

433
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:23.800
till his face be likea wet cloak ill laid up.

434
00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:26.800
Sir John.

435
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.630
Sir John.

436
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.370
I come, Master Shallow.

437
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:36.930
I come, Master Shallow.

438
00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:39.930
