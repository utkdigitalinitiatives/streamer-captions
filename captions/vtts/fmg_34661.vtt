MANY TO THE TOWN OF LEAMINGTON,
 ONTARIO.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
ONCE KNOWN JUST AS THE TOMATO
 CAPITAL OF THE NATION,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
LEAMINGTON IS NOW
 THE GREENHOUSE CAPITAL,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
PRODUCING OVER A QUARTER
 OF A BILLION POUNDS

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
OF TOMATOES EACH YEAR.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
THE MEXICANS DO MOST
 OF THE PHYSICAL WORK,

 LEAMINGTON IS THE MOST
 CONCENTRATED AREA

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
OF GREENHOUSE PRODUCTION FOR
 VEGETABLES IN NORTH AMERICA,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
RIGHT HERE.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
WHEN THE SATELLITES FLY
 OVER HERE,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
THEY CAN SEE REFLECTIONS 
 FROM ALL THE GREENHOUSES.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
THIS IS,
THIS IS REALLY BIG BUSINESS.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
WE NEED WORKERS
 IN OUR GREENHOUSE.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
WE'VE GOT 1200 ACRES
 AROUND HERE

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
AND WE NEED AT LEAST
 TWO OR THREE WORKERS PER ACRE.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
WE CAN'T GET THOSE WORKERS
FROM THE STREETS OF LEAMINGTON.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
YOU SEE THAT THE CONCENTRATION
OF GREENHOUSE

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
HAS PROVIDED US
WITH SOME CHALLENGES.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
ONE IS TO FIND
ADEQUATE WORKERS.

YOU KNOW, IF A FATHER
HAD A GREENHOUSE,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
THEN, YOU KNOW, HIS SONS BUILD
ANOTHER GREENHOUSE

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000

 BUILD A GREENHOUSE.

 UNDER THE CONTRACT,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
THE MEXICANS WORK SEVEN DAYS
A WEEK.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
TEN HOURS A DAY AND MORE,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
FOR A FLAT RATE
 OF $7.25 AN HOUR.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
MARGARET INGRATTA:
 I THINK INITIALLY YOU HAD
 TO HAVE 60% LOCAL LABOUR

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
AND 40% OFFSHORE LABOUR.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
THAT'S THE WAY THEY USED
 TO SET IT UP BEFORE.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
BUT AS THE LOCAL LABOUR
 GOT SCARCER AND SCARCER,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
EVENTUALLY IT BECAME THAT 100%
OF THE WORKERS

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
IN THE GREENHOUSES
WERE MEXICAN OFFSHORE.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
THEY HAD GREAT SUCCESS
 RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
AND THAT'S WHY IT CONTINUED

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
AND MY DAD WAS ABLE TO EXPAND
 HIS OPERATION AS WELL.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
ONCE YOU REALIZED YOU DID NOT
 HAVE TO DO ALL THE WORK

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
THEN YOU COULD GET BIGGER.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
THE REASON SOME OF THE ONES
 MAY NOT COME BACK...

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
WELL, THE ONES 
 THAT DON'T WORK OUT,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
USUALLY THEY BECOME HOMESICK
 RIGHT IN THE FIRST YEAR

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
AND THEY WANT TO GO BACK.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
THEY COME IN MAY

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
AND THEY WANT TO GO BACK
ALREADY IN AUGUST.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
AND THEN THEY DON'T REJOIN
THE PROGRAM.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
BUT IF THEY STAY

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
AND THEY COME BACK
AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
THEN IT BECOMES ROUTINE
FOR THEM.

 I HAVE TO SAY WHEN I FIRST
 BOUGHT THE PLACE,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I SAID,
WHEN ARE YOU THE BUSIEST?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
BECAUSE I WANTED TO KNOW
HOW THE BUSINESS WAS,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000

"COME SEE ME FRIDAY NIGHT

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000

HOW MANY MEXICANS WERE HERE

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000

OR THEY, THEY UM...

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000

YOU KNOW?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
I MEAN, THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS
BUT IT'S...

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
WHEN YOU'RE NOT USED
TO SOMETHING

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
IT'S LIKE WALKING INTO MEXICO

OF ITS WAY TO ACCOMMODATE.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000

THAT ARE MAYBE INEBRIATED

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
AND THE POLICEMEN JUST KIND OF
CALL THEIR OWNERS

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
AND ASK THEM TO COME
AND PICK THEM UP AND...

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
AND THAT KIND OF THING.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
STOMPIN' TOM CONNORS:
THERE WAS A GUY FROM P.E.I.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
THEY USED TO CALL POTATO,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
HE MET THIS YOUNG LEAMINGTON

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
BUT HE HAD EYES
FOR OTHER GIRLS

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000

MOVE THOSE FEET!

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
NARRATOR:
 ACCIDENTS IN THE AGRICULTURAL
 INDUSTRY ARE COMMON.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
THERE ARE NO SAFETY
 OR HEALTH LAWS

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
THAT COVER
 ONTARIO FARM WORKERS.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
THERE ARE NO REGULATIONS

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
THAT COVER THE USE
 OF PESTICIDES.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
THERE IS NO MANDATORY
 SAFETY TRAINING.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
NARRATOR:
 MARCOS GASCA NAVARRO

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
WAS WORKING AT MASTRON FARMS
 WHEN HE HAD PESTICIDE

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
ACCIDENTALLY SPRAYED
 IN HIS LEFT EYE.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
NARRATOR:
 THE TOXIN BURNED HIS CORNEA.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
IF HE'D GOTTEN 
 TO A DOCTOR QUICKLY,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
HE MIGHT HAVE SAVED IT.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
INSTEAD, HE LOST 80 PERCENT
 OF THE VISION IN HIS EYE.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
FARM WORK IS DANGEROUS
 AND THERE ARE OTHER COMPLAINTS.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
THE WORKERS PAY TAXES
 BUT GET FEW SERVICES;

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
PAY EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE
 PREMIUMS,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
BUT DON'T GET MANY BENEFITS.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
FARM UNIONS ARE ILLEGAL
 IN ONTARIO

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
BUT SOME ORGANIZERS HAVE OPENED

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
A MIGRANT WORKERS'
 SUPPORT CENTRE.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
STAN:
 WITH THE MIGRANT FARM WORKER
 WHAT HAPPENS IS,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
THEY ARE BROUGHT HERE,
 THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH ISOLATED

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
ON A GROWER OR FARMER'S
 PROPERTY

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
AND HAVE VERY LITTLE ACCESS
 TO AGENCIES

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
OR OUTSIDE INDIVIDUALS
WHO CAN ASSIST THEM.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
WHEN THEY MAKE COMPLAINTS
 ABOUT THEIR HOUSING,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
WORKING CONDITIONS,
 AN ABUSIVE EMPLOYER,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
THEY ONLY HAVE
 A COUPLE OF OPTIONS.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
ONE IS TO GO TO THE EMPLOYER

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
WHO'S CAUSING THE PROBLEM
TO BEGIN WITH,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
THE SECOND IS THE MEXICAN
CONSULATE,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
AND WHAT WE'VE FOUND 
 IS THAT THE CONSULATE

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
IS THERE TO PROTECT 
 THE CONTRACT WITH THE GROWER,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
AND PROVIDES VERY LITTLE
 SERVICE

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
TO THE INDIVIDUAL WORKER.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
IF THERE IS A PROBLEM

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
THEY'RE USUALLY ON
 THE NEXT PLANE BACK.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
EVELYN ENCLADA GREZ:
 A WORKER CAME IN SAYING
 THAT HE WAS

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
QUITE AFRAID OF GOING
 BACK TO WORK

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
BECAUSE HE HAD WITNESSED
 A CO-WORKER OF HIS

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
BEING STRANGLED
BY HIS SUPERVISOR

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
AND THEN THAT'S WHEN 
HE GOT REALLY UPSET

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
AND HE INTERVENED

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
AND PUSHED
THE SUPERVISOR AWAY.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
THE SUPERVISOR WAS SAYING
THINGS LIKE UH,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
BEFORE-
BEFORE YOU MEXICO...

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
NOBODY WANTS TO WORK 
 IN THAT TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
SO WE DECIDED
 TO INFORM THE CONSULATE

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
AND THE CONSULATE
 WANTED TO TALK TO THE WORKERS

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
AND THE SUPERVISOR.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
NARRATOR:
 A DELEGATION

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
TO HEAR THE WORKERS'
 COMPLAINTS.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
THE OWNER OF CAPITAL FARMS

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
IS NOT PLEASED
 TO SEE THE FILM CREW.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
OWNER:
 WELL, I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
I DON'T WANT 
 A CAMERA CREW HERE.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
I BELIEVE YOU CALLED ME
 A WEEK OR TWO AGO

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
AND I TOLD YOU THE SAME THING.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
WOMAN:
 RIGHT, THAT WAS A DIFFERENT
 SITUATION...

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
I'M GOING TO BE VERY SENSITIVE
AND RESPECT YOUR BUSINESS...

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
OWNER:
WELL, IF YOU'D RESPECT
MY BUSINESS,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
YOU'D SHUT THE CAMERA OFF.

NARRATOR:
 AFTER MANY HOURS,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
TEODORO'S BOSS ALLOWED THE CREW

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
TO FILM THIS MEETING BETWEEN
 THE CONSULATE AND THE WORKERS.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
NARRATOR:
 THE SUPERVISOR STAYED
 ON THE FARM

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
AND THE WORKERS WERE DRIVEN
 BACK TO THE HOUSE.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000
THE CAMERAS WERE NEVER ALLOWED
 TO TEODORO'S FARM AGAIN.

 WITH THE CONSULAR OFFICIALS.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
STAN:
 WORKERS IN LEAMINGTON
 NOW HAVE A CENTRE

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
THAT THEY CAN COME TO AND VISIT

OR CONCERNS CAN,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
WE CAN TRY AND HELP THEM.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
BUT I THINK THE WORKERS
UNDERSTAND

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
THAT WE ARE FOR THEM HERE,
RIGHT, TO HELP THEM.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000

WOMAN:
 I THINK THERE IS A LOT
 OF MISCOMMUNICATION

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
BETWEEN THE WORKERS
AND THE CONSULATE.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
CONSUL GENERAL:
I WOULD QUALIFY THIS BUSINESS
OF THE LACK OF COMM-

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
OF THE MISCOMMUNICATION
STRONGLY BECAUSE IT'S,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
I, WE, OUR PERCEPTION
IS DIFFERENT.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
I DON'T SAY YOU ARE
RIGHT OR WRONG,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
I SAY WE HAVE A DIFFERENT
PERCEPTION

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000

WE'LL TALK.

OH NO.

IN A VERY, VERY, FORCEFUL WAY.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
OKAY, WE HAVE TO LEAVE SOON
BECAUSE WE ARE,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000

NARRATOR:
 THE PROBLEM AT TEODORO'S
 WORKPLACE IS GETTING WORSE.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
THE DIPLOMAT'S VISIT

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
DID NOTHING TO COOL DOWN
 THE FOREMAN

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
AND THERE ARE STILL MONTHS
 TO GO ON THE CONTRACT.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
THE TENSION PERMEATES
 THE HOUSE.

 AN ADVOCATE FROM THE CENTRE

MARIO EPEREZ:
 UH, A LOT OF PEOPLE
 ARE VERY IGNORANT

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
AND THEY JUST CALL THEM STUPID.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
YOU KNOW THEY,
THEY TRY TO SEE THESE PEOPLE

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
AS THE LOWEST THING IN THE,
IN THE WORLD, YOU KNOW?

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT
THEY PAY TAXES TOO AND THEY,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
THEIR TAXES PAY FOR A LOT
OF WELFARE PEOPLE, YOU KNOW?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
LIKE THESE GUYS GO OUT
 SATURDAY NIGHTS.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
THEY HAVE THEIR MEXICAN BAR.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
A COUPLE OF GUYS TOLD ME
 A STORY THAT UH,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
ONE WAS SITTING IN A BAR
 AND OUT OF NO WHERE THIS GUY

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
HE CAME AND HE KICKED HIM.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
ANOTHER GUY,
 HE WAS WALKING BY HIMSELF,

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
THREE GUYS JUMPED HIM.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
YOU'LL BE SEEING SOMEBODY
 RIDING A BIKE,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
THEY'LL JUST KNOCK HIM OFF
 THE BIKE AND STEAL THEIR BIKE.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
OF COURSE IT MAKES ME FEEL SAD
 BUT YOU KNOW,

TEODORO BORROWS A VAN

TO SEE IF HE CAN ARRANGE
 A TRANSFER TO ANOTHER FARM.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
NARRATOR:
 HE CAN'T AFFORD THAT,
 AND IN ANY CASE,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
A MIGRANT WORKER
 CAN'T CHANGE FARMS

 PERMISSION.

A PROBLEM WHERE

FOUR GUYS GOT,
GOT REALLY DRUNK.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
UM, THEY CAME BACK AROUND
4:00 OR 5:00 IN THE MORNING.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
THEY CAUSED A LITTLE BIT
OF TROUBLE HERE.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
THEY DID A LITTLE BIT
OF DAMAGE AND...

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
BASICALLY I KNOW,
I KNOW THAT THEY'RE HUMANS

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000

TO DO THIS, BUT...

WHERE DO YOU DRAW
THE LINE, YOU KNOW?

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
WHEN THIS INDUSTRY
 WAS SMALLER BACK THEN,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
WHEN THERE WASN'T AS MANY GUYS,

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
I THINK THE GUYS WERE MORE
TIMID OF THEIR EMPLOYERS.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
NOW THEY'RE MORE FREE,
I THINK.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000

AND WE HAVE SOME FAIRLY
SERIOUS LINKS WITH MEXICO

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
AND AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT
 OF MEXICAN WORKERS HERE SO,

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
WE NEED THE SUPPORT
 AND THE LINKAGE.

WELL THAT'S WHAT
GLOBALIZATION'S ALL ABOUT.

 DON'T DO TOO BADLY.
