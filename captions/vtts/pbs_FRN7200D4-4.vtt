00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.700
And it's very difficult to

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:54.900
separate between of the cause

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.400
and their work.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.500

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.500
"Well anyway, I
will ask you: do"

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.730

"Can we say that BBC, for"

neutral?

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.160
There is always an influence

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.200
between the owner of the media

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.200
and the people who work there.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.030

We were taken instead to a

their leader on Al Manar.

Founded in the early '90s with

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.430
"help from Iran,

"on satellite, too-- a part of"

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.200
Hezbollah's strategy to spread

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.600
its message across the Arab

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.600
world.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.230
About 15 million people watch Al

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.760
Manar and its steady stream of

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.200

"In America and much of Europe,"

terrorist outlet.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.130
I was invited to sit through all

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.130
of Hassan Nasrallah's speech.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.000
It lasted over an hour.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.060
I didn't understand a word.

"Al Hurra, the
American channel."

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.560
Its policy has been to restrict

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.560
coverage of Hezbollah.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.830
She cut the speech down to 30

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.830
seconds.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.000
Which part of his one-hour

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.860
speech are you using?

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.830
She told me Nasrallah was

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:58.660
threatening street

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.600
demonstrations if the government

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.800
"didn't resign immediately, and"

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:17.930
that he mocked the Prime

">> REPORTER: For

"official, the kind of Arab"

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.330
politician America likes to

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.600
think is an ally.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.160
I wondered how useful Al Hurra

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.500
was to him.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.560
What do you think about Al Hurra

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.360
and why do you decide to go on

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.260
it?

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.060
it?

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.600
">> Well, let me tell you."

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.800
I'll be very sincere with you--

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.030
I think that with Al Hurra being

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.030
"an American
television, what do"

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.900
you say in English is if the one

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.160
carrying the message is not

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.330
"credible, the message is not"

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.100
credible.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:53.930
credible.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.560
"So, I think that
it's much more"

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.560
of a television that is perfect

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.330
on all levels and which I have

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.860

"Like Al Manar, for instance."

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.300
Al Manar speaks for Hezbollah.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.530
They don't have anything

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.530

"Therefore, we are a TV station"

Al Jazeera is in fact owned by

"the government
of Qatar, which,"

the biggest American base in the

Middle East.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.060
Government officials won't talk

about Al Jazeera.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.760
Analysts say it's part of a

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.760
delicate balancing act.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.830
">> Qatar is very small, tiny"

The Bush administration was

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.130
incensed.

us of inciting emotions against

I was at that time the bureau

closing down the bureau will

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.060
enhance the opportunity of

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.930
projecting another image about

actually responsible for giving

that it is a valid viewpoint.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.660
I think you have to put the

the fact that Al Jazeera is much

There's no question that Al

round of courtesy calls to Arab

"it's an important

">> Clearly, we were disturbed"

of the Arabic Al Jazeera.

mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden

Can I see that?

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:41.800

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.500
I don't think they needed a lot

of convincing.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:16.460
I don't think there's a big

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:19.460
demand out there for Al Jazeera.

I don't expect to need it.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:57.900
>> REPORTER: Marash was covering

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.660
the same busy news day as the

State Department's rapid

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.360
response team.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.560
You've got a lot of stories in

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.560
crises simultaneously in the

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.460
Middle East now.

">> We do, and I
have to say that"

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.830
we have been not only allowed

but encouraged to sort of add

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.900
that up.

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.430
What is it that explains

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:17.160
"simultaneous--
not just crises,"

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:23.260
but confrontational challenges--

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.260
"to American policy in Tehran,"

Bush's meeting on Iraq.

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.600
His old colleagues at ABC would

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.000
likely play things differently.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.030
>> The American networks will

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.360
start with Iraq and Bush first;

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.330
they're American and so is all

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:49.330
of their audience.

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:50.030
We're global and so is almost

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.800
all of our audience.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.500
That perspective means a more

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.130
critical take on America.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.200
America has never been perceived

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.130
as more isolated and less

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:59.500

pursuing that angle harder than

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.260
our network colleagues are.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.160
And it's not because we want to

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.230
"undermine America's position,"

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:14.300
it's because the reality is that

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.300
America's position is undermined

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:21.730
and nobody needs to understand

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:24.730
that more than Americans.

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:29.660
night on the road.

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:30.700
"In my hotel, I watched how the"

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.660
networks covered that day's

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.200
"English, things
were different."

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.130
"But to find it
here in America,"

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:51.130
I had to go online.

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:52.660
And I remembered a conversation

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.660
I had had back in Dubai.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:56.400
What do you think about all the

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.100
controversy in the states over

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.200
Al Jazeera English?

00:39:59.200 --> 00:39:59.860
">> You know, you were doing"

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.400
really...

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.600
I think it's absolutely

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.760
ludicrous.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.100
"It's another outlet, another"

"who, unfortunately,
I'm seeing,"

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:15.860

"insulated, more and more"

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:18.400
insular.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.060

"available in the U.S., it"

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.530
doesn't allow it to stand or

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:27.530
fall on its own merits.

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:28.730
>> REPORTER: In their efforts to

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:29.560
improve America's image in the

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.530
"Muslim world, these officers"

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:32.230
have come to believe that we

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:34.600
"have something to learn, too."

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.500

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.700
"ideas, and I have no fear that"

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.300
any ideas brought through

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.030
journalism to the United States

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.900
would be something that would so

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.100
harm us that we not only can't

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.430
"survive it, but can't learn"

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:47.800
something from it and do better.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:41:13.730
And it's a part of the world we

">> Finally tonight, how"

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.830
reporters are risking their

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:21.460
lives and their freedom to

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:43.330
uncover stories that challenge

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:48.000
>> REPORTER: Journalists: They

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.300
"are the eyes, they are the"

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.660
watchdogs of power.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:52.830
"Without journalists, there are"

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:57.200
very few checks on the excesses

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.430
of wealth and power.

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:03.430
Journalists provide information

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:08.100
that allows people to make

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:11.100
decisions about their lives.

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.860
Democracies around the world

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.830
continue to function because

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:17.530
there are journalists out there

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:18.800
"still doing their jobs, risk"

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:23.400
"their lives, still believing"

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.400
that they can make a difference.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.700
I'm Sheila Coronel.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:28.960
I'm an investigative journalist

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.930
from the Philippines.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.200
I left last year to teach at

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.200
Columbia University.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.030
I am also on the board of the

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:39.900
Committee to Protect

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.900
Journalists.

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:43.830
I started out during the

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:45.830
twilight years of the Marcos

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.830
dictatorship.

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:49.860
I was working for the largest

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:51.430
newspaper in the country.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:52.300
We were not allowed to write

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:53.500
anything negative about the

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.430
regime.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.030
We couldn't even print

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.700
photographs showing Imelda

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:01.760
Marcos's double chin.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.200
We had great hopes for freedom

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.560
"after the fall
of Marcos, but 21"

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.560
"years after, the
Philippines has"

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.160
become one of the most dangerous

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.700
places to be a journalist.

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.130
This is because the rule of law

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:17.630
is weak.

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:19.560
"The courts, the
justice system,"

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.160
the entire structure of

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.460
government cannot provide

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:25.460
protection.

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:26.500
60 journalists have been killed

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.500
since 1986.

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.830
I've lost friends in the

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:33.400
"Philippines, killed because of"

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.400
their reporting.

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.300
And while the situation in my

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:45.560
"country is
especially bad, it's"

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:49.830
With the collapse of the Soviet

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:50.800
"Union, there was a very brief"

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.660
period when a lot of independent

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:54.660
newspapers and TV stations came

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:57.560
out with critical reports of the

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.630
government.

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:02.230
But that whole era is over.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:04.430
The euphoria ended very fast.

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:06.630
The euphoria ended very fast.

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:08.160
The Russian media has been put

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.160
under severe restrictions by

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.600
"Vladimir Putin, whose allies"

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.860
have taken over most of the

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.860
media organizations.

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:22.760
The critical voices are limited

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.230
to small-circulation newspapers.

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:29.230
Anna Politkovskaya was an

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:30.160
investigative journalist.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.030
investigative journalist.

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.900
She was writing for a relatively

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.330
small newspaper about the war in

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:36.930
Chechnya.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:38.560
She wrote about a very dirty war

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.360
that most Russians would rather

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.100
forget.

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:42.460
forget.

00:44:42.460 --> 00:45:26.230
She's been called the conscience

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:32.230
>> REPORTER: Anna is one of 13

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:33.930
journalists who've been killed

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:36.560
in gangland-style executions

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.260
since the takeover of Vladimir

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.560
Putin.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.200
She was killed in her own

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.900
apartment.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.500
"A hired assassin
shot her once,"

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:51.200
and shot her again to make sure

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.330
she was really dead.

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:57.700
I think Russians will always

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.760
"remember that, in this dark"

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:11.700
"moment of their history, Anna"

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.060
Turkey has a free press but

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.960
there are certain touchy issues

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.660
that the Turkish authorities are

00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:23.530
very sensitive about.

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:26.130
Any attempt to resurrect the

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.160
genocide of Armenians that took

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.160
place in 1915 is not tolerated.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.400
Several journalists and writers

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.000
have been convicted of

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.260
"""insulting Turkishness"" for"

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:39.660
writing about the Armenian

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.660
Question.

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:44.500
Hrant Dink was a Turkish

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:45.660
Armenian.

00:46:45.660 --> 00:47:01.060
He was the editor of a well-

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:05.330
>> REPORTER: Hrant was shot just

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:08.000
outside his office by a 17-year-

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
old Turkish nationalist.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.100
"100,000 people came to his"

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:12.430
funeral.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.830
funeral.

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:16.400
funeral.

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.230
Those who gathered there

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:18.100
appreciated the importance of

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:21.100
his work.

00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:22.430
>> Today is the day we stand up

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:24.060
all together and say as

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.100
"Armenians, we're going to show"

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:27.730
the world that we will keep

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:30.730
Hrant's wishes alive.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:32.430
We will follow what Hrant's

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:35.430
"words were, what his mission,"

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:47.460
objectives were in life.

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:51.960
>> REPORTER: In many countries

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.630
"in Africa, the
press has become"

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:55.500
free after the fall of

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:58.500
autocratic regimes.

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.330
But there are places like

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:03.330
Zimbabwe where the press is very

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:06.360
much in the thrall of Mugabe.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:09.360
much in the thrall of Mugabe.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.960
>> Mr. Mugabe's government has

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.100
total control over the media.

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:17.100
He appreciates that there is

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:18.300
power in journalism.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:19.130
power in journalism.

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:20.830
He fears the free flow of the

00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:25.000
information because he knows the

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000
potential to undermine him.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.330
I started a new newspaper when

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:32.660
it had become so obvious that

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.600
the people were so tired of

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.500
government propaganda.

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:39.430
"The motto of The
Daily News was,"

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:41.800
"""Telling it like it is."""

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:44.100
And that's what we went out to

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.100
"do and, predictably,
we soon ran"

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.760
on a collision course with

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.460
Mugabe's government.

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:52.630
I was arrested.

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:54.160
"Then, some people bombed our"

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:57.400
printing press and I was advised

00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.460
to desist or I would face dire

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:03.060
consequences.

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:07.230
My greatest frustration is I am

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:13.030
away from the situation where I

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:27.460
can play a meaningful role in

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:31.400
>> REPORTER: The press has never

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.960
been freer in China than it is

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:37.930
"now, and that
freedom comes from"

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:40.930
rapid economic growth.

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:43.560
The market-- not the state--

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.500
freed the media.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.600
Journalists have been able to

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.860
write exposes about government

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:50.860
"corruption, about social"

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:53.860
"problems, but journalists must"

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.560
be constantly aware of how far

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:58.560
"they can go, because the power"

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:01.100
of the state can be exercised

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:04.060
arbitrarily and there are no

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:07.060
legal guarantees of a free

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:08.360
press.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.300
Jiang Weiping was writing about

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.230
corruption involving high

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:14.430
officials in northeast China

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:17.430
where he worked.

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:19.230
He wrote about a vice mayor who

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:20.500
lost $3 million in gambling

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.560
debt.

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:25.660
He wrote about a mayor who built

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:28.660
houses for 29 mistresses.

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:29.530
Jiang was in prison for more

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:32.460
than five years.

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:33.760
"While in jail, he wrote a"

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.730
message for his daughter:

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:37.900
"""Though the road
home has many"

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:39.560
"twists and turns, your daddy"

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.960
believes that we will be

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.960
reunited soon.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.330
This world contains so many

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:49.100
"things that are
not eternal, but"

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:51.930
only truth and justice truly

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:54.930
rule the drama of human life.

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:56.530
Your old father will not be

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:59.530
toppled on this cold night.

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:01.430
The giant dragon strides into a

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:03.330
new century.

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:04.330
Your old father stands on the

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:07.330
dragon's shoulders.

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:19.930
He will certainly pick up his

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.330
"In Iraq, some journalists were"

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:28.330
killed in the crossfire.

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:30.230
But what people don't know is

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:32.560
that most of the journalists who

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.300
have been killed have been

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:39.130
deliberately targeted.

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:42.130
Atwar Bahjat was a reporter for

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:43.100
Al Arabiya television.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.800
Her father was Sunni and her

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.230
mother was Shiite.

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:48.760
mother was Shiite.

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.060
>> REPORTER: She reported

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:52.400
fearlessly on the war and never

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:55.160
took sides in the increasingly

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.860
violent conflict there.

00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:00.130
She always wore a pendant

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:11.530
representing a unified Iraq.

00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:16.500
>> REPORTER: She was reporting

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.500
in Samarra in February 2006.

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:22.160
She was gunned down there by

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.960
unknown men who just grabbed her

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:28.260
from where she was broadcasting.

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.260
Atwar's killing shocked Iraqis

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:34.660
"because, to them,
she was really"

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:37.660
the symbol of national unity.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:40.430
Gunmen even shot at Atwar's

00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:51.230
funeral procession.

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:55.360
We've just talked about a few

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:56.800
journalists of the hundreds

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:59.800
who've been murdered or jailed

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:02.600
because of their work.

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.600
The paradox is that the press is

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.430
freer or more powerful now than

00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:11.430
it has ever been before.

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:14.830
The tragedy is that journalists

00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:18.560
who exercise that freedom pay a

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.560
very high cost.

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:24.430
What makes us humans is because

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:27.430
we can express ourselves.

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:29.060
"If we are unable to speak out,"

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:32.800
then we cannot be fully human

00:53:32.800 --> 00:00:14.600
and these journalists remind us
