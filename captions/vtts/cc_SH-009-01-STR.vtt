00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:54.300


2
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.770
Oh, for a muse of fire that would ascend

3
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.100
the brightest heaven of invention,

4
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.930
a kingdom for a stage, princes to act,

5
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.630
and monarchs to behold the swelling scene.

6
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.730
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,

7
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.500
assume the port of Mars;

8
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.730
and at his heels, leash'd in like hounds,

9
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.030
should famine, sword, and fire crouch for employment.

10
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.570
But pardon, gentles all,

11
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.270
the flat unraised spirits that have dared

12
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.070
on this unworthy scaffold

13
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.100
to bring forth so great an object.

14
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.030
Can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of France?

15
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.570
Or may we cram within this wooden O

16
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:35.700
the very casques

17
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.600
that did affright the air at Agincourt?

18
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.570
Oh, pardon,

19
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.030
since a crooked figure

20
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.370
may attest in little place a million,

21
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.400
and let us, ciphers to this great accompt,

22
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.030
on your imaginary forces work.

23
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.200
Suppose within the girdle of these walls

24
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.130
are now confined two mighty monarchies,

25
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.770
whose high upreared and abutting fronts

26
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.630
the perilous narrow ocean parts asunder.

27
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.700
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts.

28
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.630
Into a thousand parts divide one man,

29
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.600
and make imaginary puissance.

30
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.130
Think, when we talk of horses,

31
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.470
that you see them printing their proud hoofs

32
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.900
i' the receiving earth.

33
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.570
For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,

34
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.330
carry them here and there, jumping o'er times,

35
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.270
turning the accomplishment of many years

36
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.570
into an hourglass.

37
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.800
For the which supply, admit me chorus to this history,

38
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.530
who, prologue-like, your humble patience pray,

39
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.770
gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.

40
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.970
My lord, I'll tell you:

41
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.400
that self bill is urged

42
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.600
which in the 11th year of the last king's reign

43
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.800
was like and had indeed against us passed,

44
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.600
but that the scambling and unquiet time

45
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.870
did push it out of further question.

46
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.400
How, my lord, shall we resist it now?

47
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.970
It must be thought on.

48
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.070
If it pass against us,

49
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.930
we lose the better half of our possession,

50
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.230
for all the temporal lands

51
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.630
which men devout by testament have given to the church

52
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.000
would they strip from us;

53
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.730
being valued thus:

54
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.870
as much as would maintain, to the king's honor,

55
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.400
full 15 earls and 1,500 knights,

56
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.100
6,200 good esquires;

57
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.070
and to relief of lazars and weak age,

58
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.500
of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,

59
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.630
100 almshouses right well supplied;

60
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.330
and to the coffers of the king beside,

61
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.030
1,000 pounds by the year.

62
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.570
Thus runs the bill.

63
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.330
This would drink deep.

64
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.300
'Twould drink the cup and all.

65
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.130
But what prevention?

66
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.830
The king is full of grace and fair regard.

67
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.230
And a true lover of the holy Church.

68
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.370
The courses of his youth promised it not.

69
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.670
The breath no sooner left his father's body

70
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.130
but that his wildness, mortified in him,

71
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.270
seemed to die too.

72
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.370
Yea, at that very moment,

73
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.270
consideration like an angel came

74
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.770
and whipped the offending Adam out of him,

75
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.630
leaving his body as a paradise

76
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.870
to envelop and contain celestial spirits.

77
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.270
Never was such a sudden scholar made.

78
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.370
Never came reformation

79
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.030
in a flood with such a heady currance,

80
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.270
scouring faults.

81
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.930
Nor never Hydra-headed willfulness

82
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.070
so soon did lose his seat, and all at once,

83
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.270
as in this king.

84
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.600
We are blessed in the change.

85
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.700
Hear him but reason in divinity,

86
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.670
and, all-admiring, with an inward wish

87
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.070
you would desire the king were made a prelate.

88
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.930
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,

89
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.770
you would say it hath been all in all his study.

90
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.000
List his discourse of war,

91
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.600
and you shall hear a fearful battle

92
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.200
rendered you in music.

93
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.300
Turn him to any cause of policy,

94
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.030
the Gordian knot of it he will unloose,

95
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.330
familiar as his garter;

96
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.370
that, when he speaks,

97
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.830
the air, a chartered libertine,

98
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.730
is still;

99
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.000
and the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears

100
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.030
to steal his sweet and honeyed sentences

101
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.030
so that the art and practic' part of life

102
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.930
must be the mistress to this theoric--

103
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.030
which is a wonder how His Grace should glean it,

104
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.300
for his addiction was to courses vain;

105
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.800
his companies unlettered, rude, and shallow;

106
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.670
his hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports;

107
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.370
and never noted in him any study, any retirement,

108
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:41.370
any sequestration from open haunts and popularity.

109
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.030
How now for mitigation

110
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.530
of this bill urged by the commons?

111
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.470
Doth His Majesty incline to it or no?

112
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.200
He seems indifferent,

113
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.530
or rather swaying more upon our part

114
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:59.230
than cherishing the exhibiters against us,

115
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.100
for I have made an offer to His Majesty,

116
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.770
upon our spiritual convocation

117
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.800
and in regard of causes now in hand,

118
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.100
which I have opened to His Grace at large,

119
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.400
as touching France,

120
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.000
to give a greater sum

121
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.500
than ever at one time the clergy yet did

122
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.400
to his predecessors part withal.

123
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.970
How did this offer seem received, my lord?

124
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.670
With good acceptance of His Majesty,

125
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.600
save that there was not time enough to hear,

126
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.070
as I perceive His Grace would fain have done,

127
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.100
the severals and unhidden passages

128
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.130
of his true titles to some certain dukedoms

129
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.130
and generally to the crown and seat of France

130
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.270
derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.

131
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.570
What was the impediment that broke this off?

132
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.630
The French ambassador, upon that instant,

133
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.670
craved audience.

134
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.870
And the hour, I think, is come to give him hearing.

135
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.870
Is it 4:00?

136
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.870
It is.

137
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.630
Then go we in to know his embassy.

138
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.800
God and His angels guard your sacred throne

139
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.670
and make you long become it.

140
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.070
Sure, we thank you.

141
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.100
My learned lord, we pray you to proceed

142
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.630
and justly and religiously unfold

143
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.170
why the law Salique that they have in France

144
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.900
or should or should not bar us in our claim.

145
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.130
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,

146
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.870
that you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading

147
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.200
or nicely charge your understanding soul

148
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.100
with opening titles miscreate,

149
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.100
whose right suits

150
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.230
not in native colors with the truth,

151
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.300
for God doth know how many now in health

152
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.030
shall drop their blood in approbation

153
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.230
of what your reverence shall incite us to.

154
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.900
Therefore, take heed how you impawn our person,

155
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.200
how you awake our sleeping sword of war.

156
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.930
We charge you, in the name of God, take heed.

157
00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.500
Then hear me, gracious sovereign,

158
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.630
and you peers

159
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.730
that owe yourselves, your lives, and services

160
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.470
to this imperial throne.

161
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.570
There is no bar to make against Your Highness' claim to France

162
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.130
but this...

163
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.430
which they produce from Pharamond.

164
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:21.100
"In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant."

165
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.270
"No woman shall succeed in Salique land,"

166
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.630
which Salique land

167
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.070
the French unjustly gloze to be the realm of France,

168
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.430
and Pharamond the found of this law and female bar.

169
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.270
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm

170
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.630
that the land Salique is in Germany

171
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.900
between the floods of Sala and of Elbe,

172
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.670
where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,

173
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.130
there left behind and settled certain French,

174
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.170
who, holding in disdain the German women

175
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.430
for some dishonest manners of their life,

176
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.770
established then this law, to wit,

177
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.130
no female should be inheritrix in Salique land--

178
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.400
which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,

179
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.230
is at this day in Germany called Meisen.

180
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:01.030
Then doth it well appear the Salique law

181
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.170
was not devised for the realm of France,

182
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.830
howbeit they would hold up this Salique law

183
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.300
to bar Your Highness claiming from the female

184
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.200
and rather choose to hide them in a net

185
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.130
than amply to imbar their crooked titles

186
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.900
usurp'd from you and your progenitors.

187
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.170
May I with right and conscience make this claim?

188
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.430
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign,

189
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.930
for in the book of Numbers is it writ,

190
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.830
"When the man dies,

191
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.500
let the inheritance descend unto the daughter."

192
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.600
Gracious lord,

193
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.630
stand for your own.

194
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.930
Unwind your bloody flag!

195
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.200
Look back into your mighty ancestors.

196
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.930
Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,

197
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.400
from whom you claim.

198
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.730
Invoke his warlike spirit

199
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.970
and your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince.

200
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.430
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,

201
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.530
and with your puissant arm renew their feats.

202
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.470
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth

203
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.470
do all expect that you should rouse yourself,

204
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.130
as did the former lions of your blood.

205
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.230
They know Your Grace hath cause and means and might,

206
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.930
so hath Your Highness.

207
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.100
Never king of England

208
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.300
had nobles richer nor more loyal subjects,

209
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.930
whose hearts have left their bodies

210
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.030
here in England

211
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.030
and lie pavilioned in the fields of France!

212
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.270
Oh, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,

213
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.670
with blood and sword and fire to win your right.

214
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.830
In aid whereof, we of the spiritualty

215
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.570
will raise Your Highness such a mighty sum

216
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.330
as never did the clergy at one time bring in

217
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.470
to any of your ancestors.

218
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.700
We must not only arm to invade the French

219
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.270
but lay down our proportion to defend against the Scot,

220
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.630
who will make road upon us with all advantages.

221
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.970
There is a saying,

222
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.330
very old and true.

223
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.670
"If that you will France win,

224
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.930
then with Scotland first begin."

225
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:43.700
For once the eagle England being in prey,

226
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.700
to her unguarded nest the weasel Scot comes sneaking

227
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.800
and so sucks her princely eggs,

228
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.270
playing the mouse in absence of the cat

229
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.430
to tear and havoc more than she can eat.

230
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.370
Well, it follows then, the cat must stay at home.

231
00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.930
Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,

232
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.530
since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,

233
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.500
pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.

234
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.800
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,

235
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.330
the advised head defends itself at home.

236
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.470
For government, though high and low and lower,

237
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.300
put into parts doth keep in one consent,

238
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.800
congreeing in a full and natural close,

239
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.830
like music.

240
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.000
Therefore doth heaven

241
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.670
divide the state of man in divers functions,

242
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.230
setting endeavour in continual motion,

243
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:31.430
to which is fixed, as an aim or butt, obedience,

244
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.430
for thus work the honey bees,

245
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.070
creatures that, by a rule in nature,

246
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.630
teach the act of order to a peopled kingdom.

247
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.730
They have a king and officers of sorts,

248
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.070
where some, like magistrates, correct at home;

249
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.200
others, like merchants, venture trade abroad;

250
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.700
others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,

251
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.430
make root upon the summer's velvet buds,

252
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.470
which pillage they with merry march

253
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.670
bring home to the tent royal of their emperor,

254
00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.900
who, busied in His Majesty,

255
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.870
surveys the singing masons building roofs of gold,

256
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.270
the civil citizens kneading up the honey,

257
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.530
the poor mechanic porters

258
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.630
crowding in their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,

259
00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:15.070
the sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,

260
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.230
delivering o'er to executors pale

261
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.930
the lazy yawning drone.

262
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.100
I this infer:

263
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.670
that many things,

264
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.870
having full reference to one consent,

265
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.200
may work contrariously,

266
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.300
so many a thousand actions once afoot

267
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.370
end in one purpose

268
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.700
and be all well-borne without defeat.

269
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.830
Therefore to France, my liege!

270
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.770
Divide your happy England into four,

271
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.870
whereof take you one quarter into France,

272
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.070
and you withal shall make all Gallia shake.

273
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.000
If we, with thrice such powers left at home,

274
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.830
cannot defend our own doors from the dog,

275
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.330
let us be worried

276
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.370
and our nation

277
00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.130
lose the name of hardiness and policy.

278
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.500
Call in the messengers sent from the dauphin.

279
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.700
Now are we well-resolved,

280
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.300
and by God's help and yours,

281
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.700
the noble sinews of our power,

282
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.900
France, being ours,

283
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.670
#we'll bend it to our awe or break it all to pieces.

284
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.000
Now are we well-prepared

285
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.300
to know the pleasure of our fair cousin dauphin,

286
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.870
for we hear your greeting is from him, not from the king.

287
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:49.200
May it please Your Majesty to give us leave

288
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.770
freely to render what we have in charge,

289
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.400
or shall we sparingly

290
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.070
show you far off

291
00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.070
the dauphin's meaning

292
00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.330
and our embassy?

293
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.870
We are no tyrant but a Christian king

294
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.830
unto whose grace our passion is as subject

295
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.400
as are our wretches fettered in our prisons.

296
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.700
Therefore, with frank and with uncurbed plainness,

297
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.000
tell us the dauphin's mind.

298
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.970
Thus, then, in few.

299
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.800
Your Highness, lately sending into France,

300
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.070
did order certain dukedoms

301
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.670
that you claimed of your great predecessor,

302
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:31.900
King Edward III.

303
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:38.370
In answer of which claim, the prince, our master,

304
00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.470
says that you savor too much of your youth

305
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:45.500
and bids you be advised there's nought in France

306
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.330
that can be with a nimble galliard won.

307
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:52.100
You cannot revel into dukedoms there.

308
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.430
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,

309
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.870
this ton of treasure,

310
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.870
and in lieu of this

311
00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:02.470
desires you let the dukedoms that you claim

312
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.600
hear no more of you.

313
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.370
This the dauphin speaks.

314
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.500
What treasure, Uncle?

315
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.330
Tennis balls, my liege.

316
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:38.200
We are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us.

317
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:43.530
His present and your pains we thank you for.

318
00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.430
When we have matched our rackets to these balls,

319
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.600
we will, in France, by God's grace,

320
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.070
play a set shall strike his father's crown

321
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.430
into the hazard.

322
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.670
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler

323
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.600
that all the courts of France shall be disturbed with chaces.

324
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.930
And we understand him well,

325
00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.500
how he comes o'er us with our wilder days,

326
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.630
not measuring what use we made of them.

327
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.630
We never valued this poor seat of England.

328
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:10.930
And therefore, living hence,

329
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:12.770
did give ourself to barbarous license,

330
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.600
as 'tis ever common that men are merriest

331
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.670
when they are from home.

332
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.670
But tell the dauphin I will keep my state,

333
00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.930
be like a king,

334
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.330
and show my sail of greatness

335
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.430
when I do rouse me in my throne of France.

336
00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:32.300
For that I have laid by my majesty

337
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:37.000
and plodded like a man for working days,

338
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.730
but I will rise there with so full a glory

339
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.500
that I shall dazzle all the eyes of France...

340
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.470
yea, strike the dauphin blind to look on us.

341
00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.700
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his

342
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.470
hath turned his balls to gunstones,

343
00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.830
and his soul shall stand sore charged

344
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:06.000
for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them,

345
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.670
for many a thousand widows shall this, his mock,

346
00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.430
mock out of their dear husbands,

347
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:15.470
mock mothers from their sons,

348
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.830
mock castles down.

349
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.270
And some are yet ungotten and unborn

350
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.570
that shall have cause to curse the dauphin's scorn.

351
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.270
But this lies all within the will of God,

352
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.470
to whom I do appeal

353
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.330
and in whose name, tell you the dauphin,

354
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:40.870
I am coming on to venge me as I may

355
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.600
and to put forth my rightful hand

356
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.400
in a well-hallow'd cause.

357
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.230
So get you hence in peace.

358
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:57.500
And tell the dauphin his jest will savor but of shallow wit

359
00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.770
when thousands weep more than did laugh at it.

360
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.170
Convey them with safe conduct.

361
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:04.170
Fare you well.

362
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.670
This was a merry message.

363
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.700
We hope to make the sender blush at it.

364
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.570
Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour

365
00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.070
that may give furtherance to our expedition,

366
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.530
for we have now no thought in us but France,

367
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.070
save those to God, that run before our business.

368
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.170
Therefore, let our proportions for these wars

369
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.400
be soon collected

370
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.900
and all things thought upon

371
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.770
that may with reasonable swiftness

372
00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.700
add more feathers to our wings,

373
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.030
for, God before,

374
00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.570
we'll chide this dauphin at his father's door.

375
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.430
Now all the youth of England are on fire,

376
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.300
and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies.

377
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.800
Now thrive the armorers,

378
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.970
and honor's thought

379
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:55.730
reigns solely in the breast of every man.

380
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.430
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,

381
00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.600
following the mirror of all Christian kings,

382
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.670
with winged heels, as English Mercuries,

383
00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.730
for now sits expectation in the air

384
00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:09.330
and hides a sword from hilts unto the point

385
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.000
with crowns imperial,

386
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.100
crowns and coronets

387
00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.630
promised to Harry and his followers.

388
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.400
The French, advised by good intelligence

389
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.370
of this most dreadful preparation,

390
00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.230
shake in their fear

391
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.470
and with pale policy

392
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:27.330
seek to divert the English purposes.

393
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.130
Oh, England,

394
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.530
model to thy inward greatness,

395
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.200
like little body with a mighty heart,

396
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.400
what mightst thou do-- that honor would thee do--

397
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.570
were all thy children kind and natural.

398
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.300
But see thy fault.

399
00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.500
France hath in thee found out a nest of hollow bosoms,

400
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.700
which he fills with treacherous crowns,

401
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.100
and three corrupted men--

402
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.370
one Richard, Earl of Cambridge;

403
00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.200
and the second, Henry, Lord Scroop of Masham;

404
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.330
and the third, Sir Thomas Grey, Knight of Northumberland--

405
00:20:56.330 --> 00:21:00.070
have, for the gilt of France-- oh, guilt indeed--

406
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:03.230
confirmed conspiracy with fearful France.

407
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:04.670
And by their hands,

408
00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.830
this grace of kings must die

409
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.830
if hell and treason hold their promises

410
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:14.170
ere he take ship for France and in Southampton.

411
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.170
Linger your patience on,

412
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.970
and we'll digest the abuse of distance,

413
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.270
force a play.

414
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.630
The sum is paid,

415
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.130
the traitors are agreed,

416
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.230
the king is set from London,

417
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.130
and the scene is now transported, gentles,

418
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.100
to Southampton.

419
00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.800
There is the playhouse now.

420
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.500
There must you sit,

421
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.130
and thence to France shall we convey you safe

422
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.600
and bring you back,

423
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.430
charming the narrow seas to give you gentle pass,

424
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:44.630
for, if we may,

425
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:47.570
we'll not offend one stomach with our play.

426
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.670
But, till the king come forth and not till then,

427
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.270
unto Southampton do we shift our scene.

428
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.830
