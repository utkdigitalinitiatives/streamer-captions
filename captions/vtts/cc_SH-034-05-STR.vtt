00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.830


2
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.000
Approved warriors and my faithful friends,

3
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.430
I have received letters from great Rome,

4
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.270
which signifies what hate they bear their emperor

5
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.500
and how desirous of our sight they are.

6
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.600
Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,

7
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.830
imperious and impatient of your wrongs;

8
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.600
and wherein Rome hath done you any scathe,

9
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.070
let him make treble satisfaction.

10
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.270
Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,

11
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.800
whose name was once our terror, now our comfort,

12
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.130
whose high exploits and honorable deeds

13
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.200
ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,

14
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.600
be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,

15
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.670
like stinging bees in hottest summer's day,

16
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.700
led by their master to the flowered fields,

17
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.400
and be avenged on cursed Tamora.

18
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.430
And as he saith, so say we all with him.

19
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.770
Ay.

20
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.770
I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.

21
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.870
But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?

22
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.070
Renowned Lucius, from our troops I strayed

23
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.130
to gaze upon a ruinous monastery.

24
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.100
And as I earnestly did fix mine eye

25
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.330
upon the wasted building,

26
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.800
suddenly I heard a child cry underneath a wall.

27
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.870
I made unto the noise, when soon I heard

28
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.970
the crying babe controlled with this discourse:

29
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.730
"Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dame!

30
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.400
"Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,

31
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.930
"had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,

32
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.930
"villain, thou mightst have been an emperor.

33
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.230
"But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,

34
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.670
"they never do beget a coal-black calf.

35
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.100
Peace, villain, peace! "

36
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.370
even thus he rates the babe

37
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.700
"For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth,

38
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.970
"who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,

39
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.130
will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake."

40
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.600
With this, my weapon drawn, I rushed upon him,

41
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.800
surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither

42
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.300
to use as you think needful of the man.

43
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.530
O, worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil

44
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.570
that robbed Andronicus of his good hand.

45
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.970
This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye.

46
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.670
And here's the base fruit of her burning lust.

47
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.900
Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey

48
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.670
this growing image of thy fiend-like face?

49
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.630
Why dost not speak?

50
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.870
What, deaf?

51
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.700
Not a word?

52
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.000
A halter, soldiers!

53
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.270
Hang him on this tree,

54
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.670
and by his side his fruit of bastardy.

55
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.970
Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.

56
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.170
Too like the sire for ever being good.

57
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.600
First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl,

58
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.300
a sight to vex the father's soul withal.

59
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.700
Get me a ladder.

60
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.270
Lucius, save the child,

61
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.270
and bear it from me to the empress.

62
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.170
If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things

63
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.330
that highly may advantage thee to hear.

64
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.670
If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,

65
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.430
I'll speak no more but vengeance rot you all!

66
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.030
Say on; and if it please me which thou speak'st,

67
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.000
thy child shall live, and I will see it nourished.

68
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.700
And if it please thee.

69
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.070
Why, assure thee, Lucius,

70
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.300
'twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;

71
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.530
for I must talk of murders, rapes, and massacres,

72
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.170
acts of black night, abominable deeds,

73
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.970
complots of mischief, treason, villainies,

74
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.170
ruthful to hear, yet piteously performed.

75
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.530
And this shall all be buried in my death,

76
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.430
unless thou swear to me my child shall live.

77
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.530
Tell on thy mind.

78
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.130
I say thy child shall live.

79
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.830
Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.

80
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.970
Who should I swear by?

81
00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.200
Thou believest no god.

82
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.300
That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?

83
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.030
What if I do not, as indeed I do not?

84
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.470
Yet, for I know thou art religious

85
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.600
and hast a thing within thee called conscience;

86
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.530
therefore, I urge thy oath.

87
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.630
For that I know an idiot holds his bauble for a god,

88
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.770
and keeps the oath which by that god he swears,

89
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.200
to that I'll urge him.

90
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.930
Therefore, thou shalt vow by that same god

91
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.900
what god soe'er it be that thou adorest

92
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.070
and hast in reverence

93
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.500
to save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;

94
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.430
or else I will discover nought to thee.

95
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.530
Even by my god, I swear to thee I will.

96
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.370
First know thou, I begot him on the empress.

97
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.700
O, most insatiate and luxurious woman!

98
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.600
Tut, Lucius; this was but a deed of charity

99
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.300
to that which thou shalt hear of me anon.

100
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.030
'Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus.

101
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.800
They cut thy sister's tongue and ravished her

102
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.700
and cut her hands and trimmed her as thou saw'st.

103
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.230
O, detestable villain!

104
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.430
Call'st thou that trimming?

105
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.270
Why, she was washed and cut and trimmed,

106
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.230
and 'twas trim sport for them which had the doing of it.

107
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.370
O, barbarous beastly villains like thyself!

108
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.100
Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them.

109
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.900
That codding spirit had they from their mother,

110
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.000
as sure a card as ever won the set.

111
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.370
That bloody mind, I think, they learned of me,

112
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.070
as true a dog as ever fought at head.

113
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.930
Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.

114
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.630
I trained thy brethren to that guileful hole

115
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.600
where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay.

116
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.430
I wrote the letter that thy father found

117
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.970
and hid the gold within that letter mentioned,

118
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.970
confederate with the queen and her two sons.

119
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.970
And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,

120
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.870
wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?

121
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.970
I played the cheater for thy father's hand,

122
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.400
and when I had it, drew myself apart

123
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.470
and almost broke my heart with extreme laughter.

124
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.700
I pried me through the crevice of a wall,

125
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.730
when, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads,

126
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.270
beheld his tears, and laughed so heartily

127
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.800
that both mine eyes were rainy like to his.

128
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.000
And when I told the empress of this sport,

129
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.700
she sounded almost at my pleasing tale

130
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.600
and for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.

131
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.900
What, canst thou say all this and never blush?

132
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.370
Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.

133
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.530
Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?

134
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.670
Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.

135
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.800
Even now I curse the day  and yet, I think,

136
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.130
few come within the compass of my curse

137
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.070
wherein I did not some notorious ill

138
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.500
as kill a man, or else devise his death,

139
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.800
ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,

140
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.130
accuse some innocent and forswear myself,

141
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.100
set deadly enmity between two friends,

142
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.370
make poor men's cattle break their necks,

143
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.930
set fire on barns and haystacks in the night,

144
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.430
and bid the owners quench them with their tears.

145
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.300
Oft have I digged up dead men from their graves

146
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.900
and set them upright at their dear friends' door

147
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.970
even when their sorrows almost was forgot

148
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.500
and on their skins, as on the bark of trees,

149
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.230
have with my knife carved in Roman letters,

150
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.170
"Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead."

151
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.030
Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things

152
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.700
as willingly as one would kill a fly,

153
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.900
and nothing grieves me heartily indeed

154
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.400
but that I cannot do ten thousand more.

155
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.230
Bring down the devil, for he must not die

156
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.130
so sweet a death as hanging presently.

157
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.530
If there be devils, would I were a devil,

158
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.670
to live and burn in everlasting fire,

159
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.200
so I might have your company in hell

160
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.930
but to torment you with my bitter tongue!

161
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.730
Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more!

162
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.270
My lord, there is a messenger from Rome

163
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.870
desires to be admitted to your presence.

164
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.970
Let him come near.

165
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.730
Welcome, Aemilius.

166
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.130
What's the news from Rome?

167
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.100
Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,

168
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.630
the Roman emperor greets you all by me,

169
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.930
and, for he understands you are in arms,

170
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.730
he craves a parley at your father's house,

171
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.570
willing you to demand your hostages,

172
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.900
and they shall be immediately delivered.

173
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.600
What says our general?

174
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.100
Aemilius, let the emperor give his pledges

175
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.900
unto my father and my uncle Marcus, and we will come.

176
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.900
March away!

177
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:17.300
Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,

178
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.630
I will encounter with Andronicus

179
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.770
and say I am Revenge, sent from below

180
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:27.430
to join with him and right his heinous wrongs.

181
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.300
Knock at his study, where they say he keeps

182
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.330
to ruminate strange plots of dire revenge.

183
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.830
Tell him Revenge is come to join with him,

184
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.130
and work confusion on his enemies.

185
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.830
Who doth molest my contemplation?

186
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.470
Is it your trick to make me ope the door,

187
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.100
that so my sad decrees may fly away

188
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.470
and all my study be to no effect?

189
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.100
You are deceived; for what I mean to do

190
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.400
see here in bloody lines I have set down,

191
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.000
and what is written shall be executed.

192
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.530
Titus, I am come to talk with thee.

193
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:17.200
No, not a word.

194
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.900
How can I grace my talk,

195
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.800
wanting a hand to give it that accord?

196
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.570
You have the odds of me; therefore no more.

197
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.830
If thou didst know me, thou wouldst talk with me.

198
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.900
I am not mad; I know thee well enough.

199
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.600
Witness this wretched stump.

200
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.730
Witness these crimson lines.

201
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.570
Witness these trenches made by grief and care.

202
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.130
Witness the tiring day and heavy night.

203
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.370
Witness all sorrow that I know thee well

204
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.230
for our proud empress, mighty Tamora.

205
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.970
Is not thy coming for my other hand?

206
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.930
Know thou, sad man, I am not Tamora.

207
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:54.930
She is thy enemy and I thy friend.

208
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.800
I am Revenge, sent from the infernal kingdom

209
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.230
to ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind

210
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:06.370
by working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.

211
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:11.300
Therefore, come down and welcome me to this world's light.

212
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:15.800
Confer with me of murder and of death;

213
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.100
There's not a hollow cave or lurking place,

214
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.730
no vast obscurity or misty vale

215
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.700
where bloody murder or detested rape

216
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.970
can couch for fear but I will find them out

217
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.500
and in their ear tell them my dreadful name,

218
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.430
Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.

219
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.170
Art thou Revenge?

220
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:40.270
And art thou sent to me to be a torment to mine enemies?

221
00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:46.730
I am; therefore come down and welcome me.

222
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.500
Do me some service ere I come to thee.

223
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.730
Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands.

224
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.200
Now give some surance that thou art Revenge.

225
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.800
Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot wheel.

226
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.770
And then I'll come and be thy wagoner

227
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.830
and whirl along with thee about the globes.

228
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.600
Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,

229
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.130
to hale thy vengeful wagon swift away,

230
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.070
and find out murderers in their guilty caves.

231
00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.000
And when thy car is loaden with their heads,

232
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.230
I will dismount, and by thy wagon wheel

233
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.870
trot like a servile footman, all day long,

234
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.330
even from Hyperion's rising in the east

235
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.700
until his very downfall in the sea.

236
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.470
And day by day I'll do this heavy task,

237
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.730
so thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.

238
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:37.270
These are my ministers and come with me.

239
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.070
Are they thy ministers?

240
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.530
What are they called?

241
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.800
Rape and Murder; therefore called so

242
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.430
'cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.

243
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:55.700
Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are!

244
00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:00.630
And you the empress!

245
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:08.930
But we worldly men have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.

246
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:14.100
O, sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee.

247
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.900
And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,

248
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:23.700
I will embrace thee in it by and by.

249
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.200
This closing with him fits his lunacy.

250
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.770
Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick humors

251
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.070
do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,

252
00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.530
for now he firmly takes me for Revenge.

253
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.770
And, being credulous in this mad thought,

254
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:38.070
I'll make him send for Lucius his son,

255
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.330
and whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,

256
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.470
I'll find some cunning practice out of hand

257
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.700
to scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,

258
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.500
or at the least, make them his enemies.

259
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:54.800
See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.

260
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.500
Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee.

261
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.700
Welcome, dread Fury, to my woeful house.

262
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.400
Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.

263
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.570
How like the empress and her sons you are.

264
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.700
Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor.

265
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.230
Could not all hell afford you such a devil?

266
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.370
For well I wot the empress never wags

267
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:24.700
but in her company there is a Moor.

268
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.570
And, would you represent our queen aright,

269
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:30.400
it were convenient you had such a devil.

270
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.100
But welcome as you are.

271
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.200
What shall we do?

272
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.500
What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?

273
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.230
Show me a murderer; I'll deal with him.

274
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.230
Show me a villain that hath done a rape,

275
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.100
and I am sent to be revenged on him.

276
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.270
Show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong,

277
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.270
and I will be revenged on them all.

278
00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:56.170
Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,

279
00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.870
and when thou find'st a man that's like thyself,

280
00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.730
good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.

281
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.170
Go thou with him, and when it is thy hap

282
00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.330
to find another that is like to thee,

283
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:11.730
good Rapine, stab him; he's a ravisher.

284
00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.700
Go thou with them, and in the emperor's court

285
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.970
there is a queen, attended by a Moor.

286
00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.130
Well shalt thou know her by thine own proportion,

287
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.930
for up and down she doth resemble thee.

288
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.300
I pray thee, do on them some violent death.

289
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.470
They have been violent to me and mine.

290
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.230
Well hast thou lessoned us.

291
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.830
This shall we do.

292
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.270
But would it please thee, good Andronicus,

293
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:43.000
to send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,

294
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.930
who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,

295
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.530
and bid him come and banquet at thy house.

296
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.900
When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,

297
00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.270
I will bring in the empress and her sons,

298
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.970
the emperor himself, and all thy foes.

299
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.900
And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel,

300
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.000
and on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.

301
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.070
What says Andronicus to this device?

302
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:12.000
Marcus, my brother!

303
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.270
'Tis sad Titus calls.

304
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.970
Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius.

305
00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.470
Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths.

306
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.670
Bid him repair to me, and bring with him

307
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.770
some of the chiefest princes of the Goths.

308
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.370
Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are.

309
00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:38.670
Tell him the emperor and the empress too

310
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.270
feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.

311
00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:45.470
This do thou for my love, and so let him,

312
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.030
as he regards his aged father's life.

313
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.300
This shall I do, and soon return again.

314
00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.030
Now will I hence about thy business,

315
00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.230
and take my ministers along with me.

316
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.900
Nay, nay,

317
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.470
let Rape and Murder stay with me,

318
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.830
or else I'll call my brother back again

319
00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:15.730
and cleave to no revenge but Lucius.

320
00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:16.970
What say you, boys?

321
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.400
Will you abide with him

322
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.070
whiles I go tell my lord the emperor

323
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.070
how I have governed our determined jest?

324
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:25.100
Yield to his humor, smooth and speak him fair,

325
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.870
and tarry with him till I turn again.

326
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:34.370
I knew them all, though they suppose me mad,

327
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:38.370
and will o'er reach them in their own devices

328
00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.970
a pair of hell-hounds and their cursed dam.

329
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.300
Madam, depart at pleasure.

330
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.500
Leave us here.

331
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.400
Farewell, Andronicus.

332
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.570
Revenge now goes to lay a complot

333
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.670
to betray thy foes.

334
00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.030
I know thou dost;

335
00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.530
and sweet Revenge, farewell.

336
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:15.130
Tell us, old man, how shall we be employed?

337
00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:19.230
Tut, I have work enough for you to do.

338
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:25.170
Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine.

339
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.730
What is your will?

340
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.430
Know you these two?

341
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:31.200
The empress' sons, I take them: Chiron, Demetrius.

342
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:37.600
Fie, Publius, fie; thou art too much deceived.

343
00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:43.070
The one is Murder, and Rape is the other's name.

344
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:48.230
And therefore bind them, gentle Publius

345
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.800
Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them.

346
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.170
Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,

347
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.830
and now I find it; therefore bind them sure,

348
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:03.370
and stop their mouths if they begin to cry.

349
00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.070
Villains, forbear!

350
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.800
We are the empress' sons.

351
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:11.800
And therefore do what we are commanded.

352
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.570
Stop close their mouths.

353
00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.170
Let them not speak a word.

354
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.430
Is he sure bound?

355
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.430
Look that you bind them fast.

356
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.470
Come, come, Lavinia.

357
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.200
Look, thy foes are bound.

358
00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.870
Sirs, stop their mouths.

359
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.570
Let them not speak to me.

360
00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:10.070
But let them hear what fearful words I utter.

361
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.970
O, villains, Chiron and Demetrius.

362
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:17.530
Here stands the spring whom you have stained with mud;

363
00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.870
this goodly summer with your winter mixed.

364
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.670
You killed her husband, and for that vile fault

365
00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.570
two of her brothers were condemned to death,

366
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.370
my hand cut off and made a merry jest.

367
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.400
Both her sweet hands, her tongue,

368
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.570
and that more dear than hands or tongue

369
00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:37.770
her spotless chastity

370
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:43.370
inhuman traitors, you constrained and forced.

371
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.830
What would you say, if I should let you speak?

372
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:50.670
Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.

373
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:55.070
Hark, wretches, how I mean to martyr you.

374
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.000
This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,

375
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.170
whiles that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold

376
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:03.800
the basin that receives your guilty blood.

377
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.200
You know your mother means to feast with me

378
00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.230
and calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad.

379
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:14.270
Hark, wretches; I will grind your bones to dust,

380
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.000
and with your blood and it I'll make a paste;

381
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.470
and of the paste a coffin I will rear

382
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.070
and make two pasties of your shameful heads

383
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:27.270
and bid that strumpet, your unhallowed dam,

384
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:31.370
like to the earth, swallow her own increase.

385
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.500
This is the feast that I have bid her to

386
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.930
and this the banquet she shall surfeit on;

387
00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.800
for worse than Philomel you used my daughter,

388
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.370
and worse than Progne I will be revenged.

389
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.570
And now prepare your throats.

390
00:21:54.670 --> 00:22:01.630
Lavinia, come, receive the blood.

391
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.270
Come, come, be every one officious

392
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.670
to make this banquet, which I wish may prove

393
00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:13.400
more stern and bloody than the centaurs' feast.

394
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.570
Bring them in, for I will play the cook

395
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:47.000
and see them ready against their mother comes.

396
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:44.300
Uncle Marcus, since 'tis my father's mind

397
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.800
that I repair to Rome, I am content.

398
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.700
And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.

399
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.730
Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,

400
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.600
this ravenous tiger, this accursed devil.

401
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.370
Let him receive no sustenance.

402
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.630
Fetter him till he be brought unto the empress' face

403
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:05.500
for testimony of her foul proceedings.

404
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.000
And see the ambush of our friends be strong.

405
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.370
I fear the emperor means no good to us.

406
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.870
Some devil whisper curses in my ear

407
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.830
and prompt me that my tongue may utter forth

408
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.800
the venomous malice of my swelling heart!

409
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.330
Away, inhuman dog, unhallowed slave!

410
00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:34.200
Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.

411
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.900
The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.

412
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.930
What, hath the firmament more suns than one?

413
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.530
What boots it thee to can thyself a sun?

414
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.400
Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle.

415
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.900
These quarrels must be quietly debated.

416
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.630
The feast is ready which the careful Titus

417
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.400
hath ordained to an honorable end,

418
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.270
for peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome.

419
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:23.000
Please you, therefore, draw nigh and take your places.

420
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Marcus, we will.

421
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:06.500
Welcome, my lord.

422
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.430
Welcome, dread queen.

423
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:12.370
Welcome, ye warlike Goths.

424
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.000
Welcome, Lucius.

425
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.030
And welcome all.

426
00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:19.300
Although the cheer be poor, 'twill fill your stomachs.

427
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.300
Please you eat of it.

428
00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.600
Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?

429
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.900
Because I would be sure to have all well

430
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.270
to entertain Your Highness and your empress.

431
00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:34.900
We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.

432
00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.930
And if Your Highness knew my heart, you were.

433
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.830
My lord the emperor, resolve me this:

434
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:57.700
was it well done of rash Virginius

435
00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.700
to slay his daughter with his own right hand

436
00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:06.970
because she was enforced, stained, and deflowered?

437
00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.070
It was, Andronicus.

438
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:12.800
Your reason, mighty lord.

439
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.330
Because the girl should not survive her shame

440
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:19.300
and by her presence still renew his sorrows.

441
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:26.200
A reason mighty, strong, and effectual

442
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:32.330
a pattern, precedent, and lively warrant

443
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:38.430
for me, most wretched, to perform the like.

444
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:59.070
Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;

445
00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:02.630
and with thy shame thy father's sorrow die!

446
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:05.270
What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?

447
00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:10.670
Killed her for whom my tears have made me blind.

448
00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:14.170
I am as woeful as Virginius was

449
00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:18.130
and have a thousand times more cause than he

450
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.930
to do this outrage.

451
00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:24.070
And it now is done.

452
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.700
What, was she ravished?

453
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.970
Tell who did the deed.

454
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:31.200
Will it please you eat?

455
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.700
Will it please Your Highness feed?

456
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.730
Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?

457
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.600
Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius.

458
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.700
They ravished her, and cut away her tongue,

459
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:45.730
and they, 'twas they that did her all this wrong.

460
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.500
Go, fetch them hither to us presently.

461
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.170
Why, there they are, both baked in this pie

462
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.570
whereof their mother daintily hath fed,

463
00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:56.670
eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.

464
00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:02.800
'Tis true, 'tis true: witness my knife's sharp point.

465
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.200
Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!

466
00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:14.070
Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?

467
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:17.970
There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!

468
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:27.700
You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,

469
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.000
by uproars severed as a flight of fowl

470
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.930
scattered by winds and high tempestuous gusts,

471
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:38.370
O, let me teach you how to knit again

472
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:42.300
this scattered corn into one mutual sheaf,

473
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.970
these broken limbs again into one body,

474
00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:48.330
lest Rome herself be bane unto herself

475
00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.170
and she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to,

476
00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.830
like a forlorn and desperate castaway,

477
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.570
do shameful execution on herself.

478
00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.170
But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,

479
00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:03.000
grave witnesses of true experience,

480
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.500
cannot induce you to attend my words,

481
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:10.530
speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,

482
00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:13.370
when with his solemn tongue he did discourse

483
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:15.670
to love-sick Dido's sad attending ear

484
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:18.200
the story of that baleful burning night,

485
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.170
when subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy.

486
00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:26.030
Tell us what Sinon hath bewitched our ears,

487
00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:28.100
and who hath brought the fatal engine in

488
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:33.800
that gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.

489
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.070
My heart is not compact of flint nor steel,

490
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:41.100
nor can I utter all our bitter griefs,

491
00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:44.330
but floods of tears will drown my oratory

492
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:47.000
and break my utterance, even in the time

493
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.970
when it should move ye to attend me most,

494
00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:52.970
and force you to commiseration.

495
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.400
Here's Rome's young captain.

496
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.500
Let him tell the tale

497
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:02.270
while I stand by and weep to hear him speak.

498
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:06.830
Then, gracious auditory, be it known to you

499
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.730
that Chiron and the damned Demetrius

500
00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:11.500
were they that murdered our emperor's brother.

501
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:15.370
And they it were that ravished our sister.

502
00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:19.100
For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,

503
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:23.670
our father's tears despised, and basely cozened

504
00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:26.130
of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out

505
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.900
and sent her enemies unto the grave.

506
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:33.900
Lastly, myself unkindly banished,

507
00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:38.230
the gates shut on me, and turned weeping out

508
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.530
to beg relief among Rome's enemies,

509
00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.270
who drowned their enmity in my true tears

510
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:47.600
and oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.

511
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.300
I am the turned forth, be it known to you,

512
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.430
that have preserved her welfare in my blood

513
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.000
and from her bosom took the enemy's point,

514
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.170
sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.

515
00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:02.500
Alas; you know I am no vaunter, I.

516
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:06.070
My scars can witness, dumb although they are,

517
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:09.470
that my report is just and full of truth.

518
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:12.400
But, soft; methinks I do digress too much,

519
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.730
citing my worthless praise.

520
00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:17.100
O, pardon me.

521
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:21.970
For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.

522
00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:25.770
Now is my turn to speak.

523
00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:28.430
Behold the child.

524
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:30.970
Of this was Tamora delivered,

525
00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:33.300
the issue of an irreligious Moor,

526
00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.200
chief architect and plotter of these woes.

527
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.070
The villain is alive in Titus' house,

528
00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:45.070
and as he is, to witness this is true.

529
00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:49.730
Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge

530
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:53.470
these wrongs unspeakable, past patience,

531
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:57.230
or more than any living man could bear.

532
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.900
Now have you heard the truth.

533
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.730
What say you, Romans?

534
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.900
Have we done aught amiss, show us wherein,

535
00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.230
and, from the place where you behold us pleading,

536
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.200
the poor remainder of Andronici

537
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.670
will, hand in hand, all headlong hurl ourselves

538
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:15.400
and on the ragged stones beat forth our souls

539
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.900
and make a mutual closure of our house.

540
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.100
Speak, Romans, speak.

541
00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:26.130
And if you say we shall, lo, hand in hand,

542
00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:28.800
Lucius and I will fall.

543
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:33.530
Come, Marcus, come, thou reverend man of Rome,

544
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:37.300
and bring our emperor gently in thy hand,

545
00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.330
Lucius our emperor;

546
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:43.100
for well I know the common voice do cry it shall be so.

547
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:49.900
Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!

548
00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.970
Go to old Titus' sorrowful house

549
00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.100
and hither hale that misbelieving Moor

550
00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.130
to be adjudged some direful slaughtering death

551
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:59.930
as punishment for his most wicked life.

552
00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:05.370
Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!

553
00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:13.130
Thanks, gentle Romans.

554
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:15.800
May I govern so to heal Rome's harms

555
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.770
and wipe away her woe.

556
00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:21.370
But gentle people, give me aim awhile,

557
00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:24.100
for nature puts me to a heavy task.

558
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:28.670
Stand all aloof, but, uncle, draw you near

559
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:31.270
to shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.

560
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:40.970
O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,

561
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:45.330
these sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stained face

562
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:48.670
the last true duties of thy noble son.

563
00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:55.600
Tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss

564
00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:59.170
thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips.

565
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.230
O, were the sum of these that I should pay

566
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:08.300
countless and infinite, yet would I pay them.

567
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.830
Come hither, boy.

568
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:19.230
Come, come, and learn of us to melt in showers.

569
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.870
Thy grandsire loved thee well.

570
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:25.330
Many a time he danced thee on his knee,

571
00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:29.030
sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow.

572
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.670
Many a story hath he told to thee

573
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.430
and bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind

574
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.800
and talk of them when he was dead and gone.

575
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:42.030
How many thousand times have these poor lips,

576
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:45.700
when they were living, warmed themselves on thine.

577
00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.930
O, now, sweet boy, give them their latest kiss.

578
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:52.730
Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave.

579
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:56.770
Do them that kindness and take leave of them.

580
00:37:56.770 --> 00:38:00.070
Grandsire, Grandsire, even with all my heart,

581
00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.970
were I were dead so you did live again.

582
00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:06.300
O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping.

583
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.470
My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.

584
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:12.370
You sad Andronici, have done with woes.

585
00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:14.770
Give sentence on the execrable wretch

586
00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.470
who hath been breeder of these dire events.

587
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:38.900
Set him breast-deep in earth and famish him.

588
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:43.200
There let him stand and rave and cry for food.

589
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.830
If any one relieves or pities him,

590
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:46.370
for the offence he dies.

591
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:48.000
This is our doom.

592
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:56.100
Ah, why should wrath be mute and fury dumb?

593
00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.330
I am no baby, I, that with base prayers

594
00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:01.970
I should repent the evils I have done.

595
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:04.730
Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did

596
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:07.570
would I perform, if I might have my will.

597
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:11.530
If one good deed in all my life I did,

598
00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:14.630
I do repent it from my very soul.

599
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.830
Some loving friends convey the emperor hence

600
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:29.730
and give him burial in his father's grave.

601
00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:33.330
My father and Lavinia shall forthwith be closed

602
00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:36.170
in our household's monument.

603
00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:40.100
As for that ravenous tiger, Tamora

604
00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:46.970
no funeral rite nor man in mourning weed.

605
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:49.270
No mournful bell shall ring her burial,

606
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:54.400
but throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey.

607
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.870
Her life was beastly and devoid of pity,

608
00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:06.600
and being dead, let birds on her take pity.

609
00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:50.330
