00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.830


2
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.000
Approved warriors and myfaithful friends,

3
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.430
I have received lettersfrom great Rome,

4
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.270
which signifies what hatethey bear their emperor

5
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.500
and how desirous of oursight they are.

6
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.600
Therefore, great lords, be,as your titles witness,

7
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.830
imperious and impatient ofyour wrongs;

8
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.600
and wherein Rome hath doneyou any scathe,

9
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.070
let him make treblesatisfaction.

10
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.270
Brave slip, sprung fromthe great Andronicus,

11
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.800
whose name was once ourterror, now our comfort,

12
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.130
whose high exploits andhonorable deeds

13
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.200
ingrateful Rome requiteswith foul contempt,

14
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.600
be bold in us: we'llfollow where thou lead'st,

15
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.670
like stinging bees inhottest summer's day,

16
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.700
led by their master to theflowered fields,

17
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.400
and be avenged on cursedTamora.

18
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.430
And as he saith, so say weall with him.

19
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.770
Ay.

20
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.770
I humbly thank him, and Ithank you all.

21
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.870
But who comes here, led bya lusty Goth?

22
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.070
Renowned Lucius, from ourtroops I strayed

23
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.130
to gaze upon a ruinousmonastery.

24
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.100
And as I earnestly did fixmine eye

25
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.330
upon the wasted building,

26
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.800
suddenly I heard a childcry underneath a wall.

27
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.870
I made unto the noise,when soon I heard

28
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.970
the crying babe controlledwith this discourse:

29
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.730
"Peace, tawny slave, halfme and half thy dame!

30
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.400
"Did not thy hue bewraywhose brat thou art,

31
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.930
"had nature lent thee butthy mother's look,

32
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.930
"villain, thou mightsthave been an emperor.

33
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.230
"But where the bull andcow are both milk-white,

34
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.670
"they never do beget acoal-black calf.

35
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.100
Peace, villain, peace! "

36
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.370
even thus he rates thebabe

37
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.700
"For I must bear thee to atrusty Goth,

38
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.970
"who, when he knows thouart the empress' babe,

39
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.130
will hold thee dearly forthy mother's sake."

40
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.600
With this, my weapondrawn, I rushed upon him,

41
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.800
surprised him suddenly,and brought him hither

42
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.300
to use as you thinkneedful of the man.

43
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.530
O, worthy Goth, this isthe incarnate devil

44
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.570
that robbed Andronicus ofhis good hand.

45
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.970
This is the pearl thatpleased your empress' eye.

46
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.670
And here's the base fruitof her burning lust.

47
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.900
Say, wall-eyed slave,whither wouldst thou convey

48
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.670
this growing image of thyfiend-like face?

49
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.630
Why dost not speak?

50
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.870
What, deaf?

51
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.700
Not a word?

52
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.000
A halter, soldiers!

53
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.270
Hang him on this tree,

54
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.670
and by his side his fruitof bastardy.

55
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.970
Touch not the boy; he isof royal blood.

56
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.170
Too like the sire for everbeing good.

57
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.600
First hang the child, thathe may see it sprawl,

58
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.300
a sight to vex thefather's soul withal.

59
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.700
Get me a ladder.

60
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.270
Lucius, save the child,

61
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.270
and bear it from me to theempress.

62
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.170
If thou do this, I'll showthee wondrous things

63
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.330
that highly may advantagethee to hear.

64
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.670
If thou wilt not, befallwhat may befall,

65
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.430
I'll speak no more butvengeance rot you all!

66
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.030
Say on; and if it pleaseme which thou speak'st,

67
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.000
thy child shall live, andI will see it nourished.

68
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.700
And if it please thee.

69
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.070
Why, assure thee, Lucius,

70
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.300
'twill vex thy soul tohear what I shall speak;

71
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.530
for I must talk of murders,rapes, and massacres,

72
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.170
acts of black night,abominable deeds,

73
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.970
complots of mischief,treason, villainies,

74
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.170
ruthful to hear, yetpiteously performed.

75
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.530
And this shall all beburied in my death,

76
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.430
unless thou swear to me mychild shall live.

77
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.530
Tell on thy mind.

78
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.130
I say thy child shalllive.

79
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.830
Swear that he shall, andthen I will begin.

80
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.970
Who should I swear by?

81
00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.200
Thou believest no god.

82
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.300
That granted, how canstthou believe an oath?

83
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.030
What if I do not, asindeed I do not?

84
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.470
Yet, for I know thou artreligious

85
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.600
and hast a thing withinthee called conscience;

86
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.530
therefore, I urge thyoath.

87
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.630
For that I know an idiotholds his bauble for a god,

88
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.770
and keeps the oath whichby that god he swears,

89
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.200
to that I'll urge him.

90
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.930
Therefore, thou shalt vowby that same god

91
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.900
what god soe'er it be thatthou adorest

92
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.070
and hast in reverence

93
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.500
to save my boy, to nourishand bring him up;

94
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.430
or else I will discovernought to thee.

95
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.530
Even by my god, I swear tothee I will.

96
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.370
First know thou, I begothim on the empress.

97
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.700
O, most insatiate andluxurious woman!

98
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.600
Tut, Lucius; this was buta deed of charity

99
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.300
to that which thou shalthear of me anon.

100
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.030
'Twas her two sons thatmurdered Bassianus.

101
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.800
They cut thy sister'stongue and ravished her

102
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.700
and cut her hands andtrimmed her as thousaw'st.

103
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.230
O, detestable villain!

104
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.430
Call'st thou thattrimming?

105
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.270
Why, she was washed andcut and trimmed,

106
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.230
and 'twas trim sport for themwhich had the doing of it.

107
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.370
O, barbarous beastlyvillains like thyself!

108
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.100
Indeed, I was their tutorto instruct them.

109
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.900
That codding spirit hadthey from their mother,

110
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.000
as sure a card as ever wonthe set.

111
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.370
That bloody mind, I think,they learned of me,

112
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.070
as true a dog as everfought at head.

113
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.930
Well, let my deeds bewitness of my worth.

114
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.630
I trained thy brethren tothat guileful hole

115
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.600
where the dead corpse ofBassianus lay.

116
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.430
I wrote the letter thatthy father found

117
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.970
and hid the gold withinthat letter mentioned,

118
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.970
confederate with the queenand her two sons.

119
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.970
And what not done, thatthou hast cause to rue,

120
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.870
wherein I had no stroke ofmischief in it?

121
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.970
I played the cheater forthy father's hand,

122
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.400
and when I had it, drewmyself apart

123
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.470
and almost broke my heartwith extreme laughter.

124
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.700
I pried me through thecrevice of a wall,

125
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.730
when, for his hand, he hadhis two sons' heads,

126
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.270
beheld his tears, andlaughed so heartily

127
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.800
that both mine eyes wererainy like to his.

128
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.000
And when I told theempress of this sport,

129
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.700
she sounded almost at mypleasing tale

130
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.600
and for my tidings gave metwenty kisses.

131
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.900
What, canst thou say allthis and never blush?

132
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.370
Ay, like a black dog, asthe saying is.

133
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.530
Art thou not sorry forthese heinous deeds?

134
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.670
Ay, that I had not done athousand more.

135
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.800
Even now I curse the day and yet, I think,

136
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.130
few come within thecompass of my curse

137
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.070
wherein I did not somenotorious ill

138
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.500
as kill a man, or elsedevise his death,

139
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.800
ravish a maid, or plot theway to do it,

140
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.130
accuse some innocent andforswear myself,

141
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.100
set deadly enmity betweentwo friends,

142
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.370
make poor men's cattlebreak their necks,

143
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.930
set fire on barns andhaystacks in the night,

144
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.430
and bid the owners quenchthem with their tears.

145
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.300
Oft have I digged up deadmen from their graves

146
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.900
and set them upright attheir dear friends' door

147
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.970
even when their sorrowsalmost was forgot

148
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.500
and on their skins, as onthe bark of trees,

149
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.230
have with my knife carvedin Roman letters,

150
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.170
"Let not your sorrow die,though I am dead."

151
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.030
Tut, I have done athousand dreadful things

152
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.700
as willingly as one wouldkill a fly,

153
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.900
and nothing grieves meheartily indeed

154
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.400
but that I cannot do tenthousand more.

155
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.230
Bring down the devil, forhe must not die

156
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.130
so sweet a death ashanging presently.

157
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.530
If there be devils, wouldI were a devil,

158
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.670
to live and burn ineverlasting fire,

159
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.200
so I might have yourcompany in hell

160
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.930
but to torment you with mybitter tongue!

161
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.730
Sirs, stop his mouth, andlet him speak no more!

162
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.270
My lord, there is amessenger from Rome

163
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.870

164
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.970
Let him come near.

165
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.730
Welcome, Aemilius.

166
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.130
What's the news from Rome?

167
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.100
Lord Lucius, and youprinces of the Goths,

168
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.630
the Roman emperor greetsyou all by me,

and, for he understandsyou are in arms,

Aemilius, let the emperorgive his pledges

175
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.900
unto my father and my uncleMarcus, and we will come.

176
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.900
March away!

177
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:17.300
Thus, in this strange andsad habiliment,

178
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.630

Knock at his study, wherethey say he keeps

182
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.330
to ruminate strange plotsof dire revenge.

183
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.830
Tell him Revenge is cometo join with him,

184
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.130
and work confusion on hisenemies.

185
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.830
Who doth molest mycontemplation?

186
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.470
Is it your trick to makeme ope the door,

187
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.100

188
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.470

No, not a word.

194
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.900
How can I grace my talk,

195
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.800
wanting a hand to give itthat accord?

196
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.570
You have the odds of me;therefore no more.

197
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.830
If thou didst know me,thou wouldst talk with me.

198
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.900
I am not mad; I know theewell enough.

Witness these crimsonlines.

201
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.570
Witness these trenchesmade by grief and care.

202
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.130
Witness the tiring day andheavy night.

203
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.370
Witness all sorrow that Iknow thee well

204
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.230
for our proud empress,mighty Tamora.

205
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.970
Is not thy coming for myother hand?

206
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.930
Know thou, sad man, I amnot Tamora.

207
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:54.930
She is thy enemy and I thyfriend.

208
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.800
I am Revenge, sent fromthe infernal kingdom

209
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.230

no vast obscurity or mistyvale

215
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.700
where bloody murder ordetested rape

216
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.970
can couch for fear but Iwill find them out

217
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.500
and in their ear tell themmy dreadful name,

218
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.430
Revenge, which makes thefoul offender quake.

219
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.170

Lo, by thy side where Rapeand Murder stands.

224
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.200
Now give some surance thatthou art Revenge.

225
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.800
Stab them, or tear them onthy chariot wheel.

226
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.770
And then I'll come and bethy wagoner

227
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.830
and whirl along with theeabout the globes.

228
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.600
Provide thee two properpalfreys, black as jet,

229
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.130
to hale thy vengeful wagonswift away,

230
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.070
and find out murderers intheir guilty caves.

231
00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.000
And when thy car is loadenwith their heads,

232
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.230
I will dismount, and bythy wagon wheel

233
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.870
trot like a servilefootman, all day long,

234
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.330
even from Hyperion'srising in the east

235
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.700
until his very downfall inthe sea.

236
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.470
And day by day I'll dothis heavy task,

237
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.730
so thou destroy Rapine andMurder there.

238
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:37.270
These are my ministers andcome with me.

239
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.070
Are they thy ministers?

240
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.530
What are they called?

241
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.800
Rape and Murder; thereforecalled so

242
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.430
'cause they take vengeanceof such kind of men.

243
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:55.700
Good Lord, how like theempress' sons they are!

244
00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:00.630
And you the empress!

245
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:08.930
But we worldly men havemiserable, mad, mistaking eyes.

246
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:14.100
O, sweet Revenge, now do Icome to thee.

247
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.900
And, if one arm's embracementwill content thee,

248
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:23.700
I will embrace thee in itby and by.

249
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.200
This closing with him fitshis lunacy.

250
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.770
Whate'er I forge to feedhis brain-sick humors

251
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.070
do you uphold and maintainin your speeches,

252
00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.530
for now he firmly takes mefor Revenge.

253
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.770
And, being credulous inthis mad thought,

254
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:38.070
I'll make him send forLucius his son,

255
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.330
and whilst I at a banquethold him sure,

256
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.470
I'll find some cunningpractice out of hand

257
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.700
to scatter and dispersethe giddy Goths,

258
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.500
or at the least, make themhis enemies.

259
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:54.800
See, here he comes, and Imust ply my theme.

260
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.500
Long have I been forlorn,and all for thee.

261
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.700
Welcome, dread Fury, to mywoeful house.

262
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.400
Rapine and Murder, you arewelcome too.

263
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.570
How like the empress andher sons you are.

264
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.700
Well are you fitted, hadyou but a Moor.

265
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.230
Could not all hell affordyou such a devil?

266
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.370
For well I wot the empressnever wags

267
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:24.700
but in her company thereis a Moor.

268
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.570
And, would you representour queen aright,

269
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:30.400
it were convenient you hadsuch a devil.

270
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.100
But welcome as you are.

271
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.200
What shall we do?

272
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.500
What wouldst thou have usdo, Andronicus?

273
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.230
Show me a murderer; I'lldeal with him.

274
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.230
Show me a villain thathath done a rape,

275
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.100
and I am sent to berevenged on him.

276
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.270
Show me a thousand thathath done thee wrong,

277
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.270
and I will be revenged onthem all.

278
00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:56.170
Look round about thewicked streets of Rome,

279
00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.870
and when thou find'st aman that's like thyself,

280
00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.730
good Murder, stab him;he's a murderer.

281
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.170
Go thou with him, and whenit is thy hap

282
00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.330
to find another that islike to thee,

283
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:11.730
good Rapine, stab him;he's a ravisher.

284
00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.700
Go thou with them, and inthe emperor's court

285
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.970
there is a queen, attendedby a Moor.

286
00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.130
Well shalt thou know herby thine own proportion,

287
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.930
for up and down she dothresemble thee.

288
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.300
I pray thee, do on themsome violent death.

289
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.470
They have been violent tome and mine.

290

Well hast thou lessonedus.

291
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.830
This shall we do.

292
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.270
But would it please thee,good Andronicus,

293
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:43.000

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.270
I will bring in theempress and her sons,

298

299
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.900
And at thy mercy shallthey stoop and kneel,

300
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.000
and on them shalt thouease thy angry heart.

301
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.070

Let them not speak a word.

354
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.430
Is he sure bound?

355
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.430
Look that you bind themfast.

356
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.470
Come, come, Lavinia.

357
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.200
Look, thy foes are bound.

358
00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.870
Sirs, stop their mouths.

359
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.570
Let them not speak to me.

360
00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:10.070
But let them hear whatfearful words I utter.

361
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.970
O, villains, Chiron andDemetrius.

362
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:17.530
Here stands the spring whomyou have stained with mud;

363
00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.870
this goodly summer withyour winter mixed.

364
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.670
You killed her husband,and for that vile fault

365
00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.570
two of her brothers werecondemned to death,

366
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.370
my hand cut off and made amerry jest.

367
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.400
Both her sweet hands, hertongue,

368
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.570
and that more dear thanhands or tongue

369
00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:37.770
her spotless chastity

370
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:43.370
inhuman traitors, youconstrained and forced.

371
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.830
What would you say, if Ishould let you speak?

372
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:50.670
Villains, for shame youcould not beg for grace.

373
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:55.070
Hark, wretches, how I meanto martyr you.

374
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.000
This one hand yet is leftto cut your throats,

375
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.170
whiles that Lavinia 'tweenher stumps doth hold

376
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:03.800
the basin that receivesyour guilty blood.

377
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.200
You know your mother meansto feast with me

378
00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.230
and calls herself Revenge,and thinks me mad.

379
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:14.270
Hark, wretches; I willgrind your bones to dust,

380
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.000
and with your blood and itI'll make a paste;

381
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.470
and of the paste a coffinI will rear

382
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.070
and make two pasties ofyour shameful heads

383
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:27.270
and bid that strumpet,your unhallowed dam,

384
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:31.370
like to the earth, swallowher own increase.

385
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.500
This is the feast that Ihave bid her to

386
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.930
and this the banquet sheshall surfeit on;

387
00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.800
for worse than Philomelyou used my daughter,

388
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.370
and worse than Progne Iwill be revenged.

389
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.570
And now prepare yourthroats.

390
00:21:54.670 --> 00:22:01.630
Lavinia, come, receive theblood.

391
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.270
Come, come, be every oneofficious

392
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.670
to make this banquet,which I wish may prove

393
00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:13.400
more stern and bloody thanthe centaurs' feast.

394
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.570
Bring them in, for I willplay the cook

395
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:47.000
and see them ready againsttheir mother comes.

396
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:44.300
Uncle Marcus, since 'tismy father's mind

397
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.800
that I repair to Rome, Iam content.

398
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.700
And ours with thine,befall what fortune will.

399
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.730
Good uncle, take you inthis barbarous Moor,

400
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.600
this ravenous tiger, thisaccursed devil.

401
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.370
Let him receive nosustenance.

402
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.630
Fetter him till he be broughtunto the empress' face

403
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:05.500
for testimony of her foulproceedings.

404
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.000
And see the ambush of ourfriends be strong.

405
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.370
I fear the emperor meansno good to us.

406
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.870
Some devil whisper cursesin my ear

407
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.830
and prompt me that mytongue may utter forth

408
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.800
the venomous malice of myswelling heart!

409
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.330
Away, inhuman dog,unhallowed slave!

410
00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:34.200
Sirs, help our uncle toconvey him in.

411
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.900
The trumpets show theemperor is at hand.

412
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.930
What, hath the firmamentmore suns than one?

413
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.530
What boots it thee to canthyself a sun?

414
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.400
Rome's emperor, andnephew, break the parle.

415
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.900
These quarrels must bequietly debated.

416
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.630
The feast is ready whichthe careful Titus

417
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.400
hath ordained to anhonorable end,

418
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.270
for peace, for love, forleague, and good to Rome.

419
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:23.000
Please you, therefore, drawnigh and take your places.

420
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Marcus, we will.

421
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:06.500
Welcome, my lord.

422
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.430
Welcome, dread queen.

423
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:12.370
Welcome, ye warlike Goths.

424
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.000
Welcome, Lucius.

425
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.030
And welcome all.

426
00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:19.300
Although the cheer be poor,'twill fill your stomachs.

427
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.300
Please you eat of it.

428
00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.600
Why art thou thus attired,Andronicus?

429
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.900
Because I would be sure tohave all well

430
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.270
to entertain Your Highnessand your empress.

431
00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:34.900
We are beholding to you,good Andronicus.

432
00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.930
And if Your Highness knewmy heart, you were.

433
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.830
My lord the emperor,resolve me this:

434
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:57.700
was it well done of rashVirginius

435
00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.700
to slay his daughter withhis own right hand

436
00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:06.970
because she was enforced,stained, and deflowered?

437
00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.070
It was, Andronicus.

438
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:12.800
Your reason, mighty lord.

439
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.330
Because the girl shouldnot survive her shame

440
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:19.300
and by her presence stillrenew his sorrows.

441
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:26.200
A reason mighty, strong,and effectual

442
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:32.330
a pattern, precedent, andlively warrant

443
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:38.430
for me, most wretched, toperform the like.

444
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:59.070
Die, die, Lavinia, and thyshame with thee;

445
00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:02.630
and with thy shame thyfather's sorrow die!

446
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:05.270
What hast thou done,unnatural and unkind?

447
00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:10.670
Killed her for whom mytears have made me blind.

448
00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:14.170
I am as woeful asVirginius was

449
00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:18.130
and have a thousand timesmore cause than he

450
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.930
to do this outrage.

451
00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:24.070
And it now is done.

452
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.700
What, was she ravished?

453
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.970
Tell who did the deed.

454
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:31.200
Will it please you eat?

455
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.700
Will it please YourHighness feed?

456
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.730
Why hast thou slain thineonly daughter thus?

457
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.600
Not I; 'twas Chiron andDemetrius.

458
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.700
They ravished her, and cutaway her tongue,

459
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:45.730
and they, 'twas they thatdid her all this wrong.

460
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.500
Go, fetch them hither tous presently.

461
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.170
Why, there they are, bothbaked in this pie

462
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.570
whereof their motherdaintily hath fed,

463
00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:56.670
eating the flesh that sheherself hath bred.

464
00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:02.800
'Tis true, 'tis true: witnessmy knife's sharp point.

465
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.200
Die, frantic wretch, forthis accursed deed!

466
00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:14.070
Can the son's eye beholdhis father bleed?

467
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:17.970
There's meed for meed,death for a deadly deed!

468
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:27.700
You sad-faced men, peopleand sons of Rome,

469
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.000
by uproars severed as aflight of fowl

470
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.930
scattered by winds andhigh tempestuous gusts,

471
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:38.370
O, let me teach you how toknit again

472
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:42.300
this scattered corn intoone mutual sheaf,

473
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.970
these broken limbs againinto one body,

474
00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:48.330
lest Rome herself be baneunto herself

475
00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.170
and she whom mightykingdoms curtsy to,

476
00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.830
like a forlorn anddesperate castaway,

477
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.570
do shameful execution onherself.

478
00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.170
But if my frosty signs andchaps of age,

479
00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:03.000
grave witnesses of trueexperience,

480
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.500
cannot induce you toattend my words,

481
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:10.530
speak, Rome's dear friend,as erst our ancestor,

482
00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:13.370
when with his solemntongue he did discourse

483
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:15.670
to love-sick Dido's sadattending ear

484
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:18.200
the story of that balefulburning night,

485
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.170
when subtle Greeks surprisedKing Priam's Troy.

486
00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:26.030
Tell us what Sinon hathbewitched our ears,

487
00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:28.100
and who hath brought thefatal engine in

488
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:33.800
that gives our Troy, ourRome, the civil wound.

489
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.070
My heart is not compact offlint nor steel,

490
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:41.100
nor can I utter all ourbitter griefs,

491
00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:44.330
but floods of tears willdrown my oratory

492
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:47.000
and break my utterance,even in the time

493
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.970
when it should move ye toattend me most,

494
00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:52.970
and force you tocommiseration.

495
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.400
Here's Rome's youngcaptain.

496
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.500
Let him tell the tale

497
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:02.270
while I stand by and weepto hear him speak.

498
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:06.830
Then, gracious auditory,be it known to you

499
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.730
that Chiron and the damnedDemetrius

500
00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:11.500
were they that murderedour emperor's brother.

501
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:15.370
And they it were thatravished our sister.

502
00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:19.100
For their fell faults ourbrothers were beheaded,

503
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:23.670
our father's tears despised,and basely cozened

504
00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:26.130
of that true hand thatfought Rome's quarrel out

505
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.900
and sent her enemies untothe grave.

506
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:33.900
Lastly, myself unkindlybanished,

507
00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:38.230
the gates shut on me, andturned weeping out

508
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.530
to beg relief among Rome'senemies,

509
00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.270
who drowned their enmityin my true tears

510
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:47.600
and oped their arms toembrace me as a friend.

511
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.300
I am the turned forth, beit known to you,

512
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.430
that have preserved herwelfare in my blood

513
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.000
and from her bosom tookthe enemy's point,

514
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.170
sheathing the steel in myadventurous body.

515
00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:02.500
Alas; you know I am novaunter, I.

516
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:06.070
My scars can witness, dumbalthough they are,

517
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:09.470
that my report is just andfull of truth.

518
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:12.400
But, soft; methinks I dodigress too much,

519
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.730
citing my worthlesspraise.

520
00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:17.100
O, pardon me.

521
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:21.970
For when no friends areby, men praise themselves.

522
00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:25.770
Now is my turn to speak.

523
00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:28.430
Behold the child.

524
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:30.970
Of this was Tamoradelivered,

525
00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:33.300
the issue of anirreligious Moor,

526
00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.200
chief architect andplotter of these woes.

527
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.070
The villain is alive inTitus' house,

528
00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:45.070
and as he is, to witnessthis is true.

529
00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:49.730
Now judge what cause hadTitus to revenge

530
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:53.470
these wrongs unspeakable,past patience,

531
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:57.230
or more than any livingman could bear.

532
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.900
Now have you heard thetruth.

533
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.730
What say you, Romans?

534
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.900
Have we done aught amiss,show us wherein,

535
00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.230
and, from the place whereyou behold us pleading,

536
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.200
the poor remainder ofAndronici

537
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.670
will, hand in hand, allheadlong hurl ourselves

538
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:15.400
and on the ragged stonesbeat forth our souls

539
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.900
and make a mutual closureof our house.

540
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.100
Speak, Romans, speak.

541
00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:26.130
And if you say we shall,lo, hand in hand,

542
00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:28.800
Lucius and I will fall.

543
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:33.530
Come, Marcus, come, thoureverend man of Rome,

544
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:37.300
and bring our emperorgently in thy hand,

545
00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.330
Lucius our emperor;

546
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:43.100
for well I know the commonvoice do cry it shall be so.

547
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:49.900
Lucius, all hail, Rome'sroyal emperor!

548
00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.970
Go to old Titus' sorrowfulhouse

549
00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.100
and hither hale thatmisbelieving Moor

550
00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.130
to be adjudged somedireful slaughtering death

551
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:59.930
as punishment for his mostwicked life.

552
00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:05.370
Lucius, all hail, Rome'sgracious governor!

553
00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:13.130
Thanks, gentle Romans.

554
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:15.800
May I govern so to healRome's harms

555
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.770
and wipe away her woe.

556
00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:21.370
But gentle people, give meaim awhile,

557
00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:24.100
for nature puts me to aheavy task.

558
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:28.670
Stand all aloof, but,uncle, draw you near

559
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:31.270
to shed obsequious tearsupon this trunk.

560
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:40.970
O, take this warm kiss onthy pale cold lips,

561
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:45.330
these sorrowful drops uponthy blood-stained face

562
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:48.670
the last true duties ofthy noble son.

563
00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:55.600
Tear for tear and lovingkiss for kiss

564
00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:59.170
thy brother Marcus tenderson thy lips.

565
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.230
O, were the sum of thesethat I should pay

566
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:08.300
countless and infinite,yet would I pay them.

567
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.830
Come hither, boy.

568
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:19.230
Come, come, and learn ofus to melt in showers.

569
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.870
Thy grandsire loved theewell.

570
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:25.330
Many a time he danced theeon his knee,

571
00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:29.030
sung thee asleep, hisloving breast thy pillow.

572
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.670
Many a story hath he toldto thee

573
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.430
and bid thee bear hispretty tales in mind

574
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.800
and talk of them when hewas dead and gone.

575
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:42.030
How many thousand timeshave these poor lips,

576
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:45.700
when they were living,warmed themselves on thine.

577
00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.930
O, now, sweet boy, givethem their latest kiss.

578
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:52.730
Bid him farewell; commithim to the grave.

579
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:56.770
Do them that kindness andtake leave of them.

580
00:37:56.770 --> 00:38:00.070
Grandsire, Grandsire, evenwith all my heart,

581
00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.970
were I were dead so youdid live again.

582
00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:06.300
O Lord, I cannot speak tohim for weeping.

583
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.470
My tears will choke me, ifI ope my mouth.

584
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:12.370
You sad Andronici, havedone with woes.

585
00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:14.770
Give sentence on theexecrable wretch

586
00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.470
who hath been breeder ofthese dire events.

587
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:38.900
Set him breast-deep inearth and famish him.

588
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:43.200
There let him stand andrave and cry for food.

589
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.830
If any one relieves orpities him,

590
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:46.370
for the offence he dies.

591
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:48.000
This is our doom.

592
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:56.100
Ah, why should wrath bemute and fury dumb?

593
00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.330
I am no baby, I, that withbase prayers

594
00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:01.970
I should repent the evilsI have done.

595
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:04.730
Ten thousand worse thanever yet I did

596
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:07.570
would I perform, if Imight have my will.

597
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:11.530
If one good deed in all mylife I did,

598
00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:14.630
I do repent it from myvery soul.

599
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.830
Some loving friends conveythe emperor hence

600
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:29.730
and give him burial in hisfather's grave.

601
00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:33.330
My father and Laviniashall forthwith be closed

602
00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:36.170
in our household'smonument.

603
00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:40.100
As for that ravenoustiger, Tamora

604
00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:46.970
no funeral rite nor man inmourning weed.

605
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:49.270
No mournful bell shallring her burial,

606
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:54.400
but throw her forth tobeasts and birds to prey.

607
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.870
Her life was beastly anddevoid of pity,

608
00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:06.600
and being dead, let birdson her take pity.

609
00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:50.330
