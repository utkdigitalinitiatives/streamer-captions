00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.566
- In nature,
animals compete to survive.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.666
The fittest, fastest, strongest,
or smartest will make it.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.433
And for most of human history,

00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:21.266
we, too, have struggled
to survive.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.800
Finding food, fighting disease,

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:25.600
and dealing with
the environment around us

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:28.800
have all been great challenges.

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:30.933
But humans
have overcome many of these.

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.933
Our population has exploded

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.166
as we've built cities,
farmed land,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.566
and developed cures
for most of the major diseases

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.100
of the past.

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:42.733
Today humans have
the understanding and technology

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:45.200
to alter
the basic structures of life,

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:48.633
the genetic code
of any living organism.

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.633
We could ensure
every baby is healthy

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.933
or make crops grow
in the desert.

00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.600
But how is this possible?

00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:58.633
And what precautions
do we need to take?

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.800
In this program,
we look at the science

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:04.330
behind the benefits
of genetic engineering,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.633
including genetic manipulation:
the basics;

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:11.400
genetic manipulation:
what, why, and how;

00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:14.000
human uses
of genetic manipulation,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.966
agricultural uses
of genetic manipulation,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.766
environmental uses
of genetic manipulation,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.800
and ethical issues.

00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:35.766
You probably know genes
provide the information

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.330
for all cells,
tissues, and organs

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.633
that make up our bodies.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.300
They're our blueprint.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:44.500
We could say genes are
the instruction book

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:47.966
for all the proteins
that make up our structure.

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:51.266
Our genes are made up of DNA.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.500
That's deoxyribonucleic acid.

00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:57.300
You might recognize
the DNA double helix.

00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:59.400
It's structured like a ladder.

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:02.566
The rungs of the ladder
are the four nucleotides.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.400
They link together like this.

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:07.400
Adenine links to thymine.

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:10.100
Cytosine links to guanine.

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:13.600
These base-pairs line up
in a specific order.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.400
It's this order that determines

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:18.733
which protein
the gene codes for.

00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:21.266
The process of reading
the DNA instructions

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.966
and building
the protein they describe

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.660
is called protein synthesis.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.500
It starts in the nucleus
where the DNA is untwisted,

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:34.166
then read and copied
into a strand of messenger RNA,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.766
or mRNA.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.800
We call this transcription.

00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:41.733
It's important to remember
that the information in a gene

00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:44.633
is read in the lots
of three bases.

00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:48.766
Each triplet of bases
is called a codon.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.433
Each codon is the information
for a specific amino acid.

00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:55.800
The mRNA moves out into the cell

00:02:55.833 --> 00:02:57.166
where the codons are translated

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.433
into their matching amino acid.

00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:03.866
These are linked together
to form a protein.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.866
So that's how DNA works
as the body's blueprint.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.200
So what would happen
if we could take out a segment

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:14.400
of the DNA and change
the function of a gene?

00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:17.500
We'd be changing a chapter
in the instruction book.

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:20.633
That's called gene manipulation.

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:23.700
Before scientists can change
the genetic makeup

00:03:23.733 --> 00:03:25.700
of an organism,
they need to understand

00:03:25.733 --> 00:03:28.333
which genes
carry which information.

00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:29.900
So let's take a closer look
at a gene

00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:32.500
and see how that's done.

00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:35.866
A gene is made up of a promoter,
a coding section,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.833
and then a stop codon.

00:03:37.866 --> 00:03:40.266
The promoter marks the start
of the gene.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.133
It's like the on-off switch.

00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:45.633
And at the end of the gene
is the stop codon.

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:49.633
This gives the instruction
to stop making the protein.

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:53.330
Some sections of the DNA
are noncoding.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.466
We also call them junk DNA.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.600
These sections
don't carry any instructions

00:03:57.633 --> 00:04:02.433
for making proteins.

00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:04.466
Here's a coding section of DNA.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.000
It's our gene.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.900
This section
carries information.

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:13.266
If scientists can figure out
what a gene codes for,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.433
then they have the option
of changing that information.

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:18.633
Genes can be moved, copied,

00:04:18.666 --> 00:04:20.366
or even put
into other organisms.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.766
More about that in a moment.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.330
Genes provide the instructions
for all the proteins

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.366
in our bodies
and are made up of DNA.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.733
Every animal and plant
has its own DNA.

00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:37.700
DNA has coding
and noncoding sections.

00:04:37.733 --> 00:04:41.100
Scientists can change
the genetic code of an organism

00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:46.330
if they know which genes
code for which information.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.200
So now we have
the low-down on genes;

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:03.666
it's time to get to the bottom
of genetic manipulation.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.166
You've seen
some dramatic results

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.100
of genetic technologies on TV:

00:05:08.133 --> 00:05:13.166
Dolly the sheep, gene therapies,
maybe one day a cure for cancer.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.433
But how does all this happen?

00:05:16.466 --> 00:05:18.166
Nature often makes mistakes

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.633
in copying
a gene's DNA sequence.

00:05:20.666 --> 00:05:23.966
The result of this is a change
in the genetic code.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.100
We call it a mutation.

00:05:26.133 --> 00:05:30.233
Some mutations are harmful,
but some are helpful.

00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:33.733
Genetic manipulation allows
scientists to decide

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.800
which genes to change.

00:05:35.833 --> 00:05:38.100
They can carefully alter
the DNA sequence,

00:05:38.133 --> 00:05:41.660
changing the gene
and the protein it codes for.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.660
So let's say
we have two organisms--

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.700
we'll call them A and B--

00:05:46.733 --> 00:05:48.966
and we want to take
a gene from A

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.100
and put it into B.

00:05:51.133 --> 00:05:52.900
Scientists use a technique

00:05:52.933 --> 00:05:56.660
called polymerase
chain reaction, PCR,

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.766
to copy and study genes.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.700
Let's take the DNA
from our organism and copy it.

00:06:02.733 --> 00:06:07.660
PCR allows scientists
to make many copies of the gene

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.700
so they have enough
to work with.

00:06:09.733 --> 00:06:12.733
The next step is to take
this section of DNA

00:06:12.766 --> 00:06:14.800
and place it
into a second organism.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:17.900
We can do this using a vector.

00:06:17.933 --> 00:06:22.133
Scientists sometimes
use viruses as vectors.

00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:23.700
The viruses aren't infectious

00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:27.433
and can be packaged up
with our extra piece of DNA.

00:06:27.466 --> 00:06:30.660
The viral vector takes
this new genetic material

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.933
and places it
inside our target cell.

00:06:33.966 --> 00:06:36.166
Or here's another way to do it.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.166
The gene can also be
incorporated

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.833
into a little ring of DNA
called a plasmid.

00:06:42.866 --> 00:06:45.666
This DNA ring
is taken into the foreign cell

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.900
and incorporated
into the genetic code.

00:06:49.933 --> 00:06:54.433
Those few steps form the basis
of genetic modification.

00:06:54.466 --> 00:06:56.800
Of course, when you talk about
genetic engineering,

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.633
most people think of cloning.

00:06:58.666 --> 00:07:01.500
To clone means to copy.

00:07:01.533 --> 00:07:06.266
We can clone a piece of DNA
to put it into another organism.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.330
This is called
molecular cloning.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.500
We could clone a cell
to make many copies of it.

00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:15.733
This is called cellular cloning.

00:07:15.766 --> 00:07:18.900
But what about making
a copy of a whole organism?

00:07:18.933 --> 00:07:21.233
For this,
scientists use a technique

00:07:21.266 --> 00:07:22.733
known as nuclear cloning

00:07:22.766 --> 00:07:28.600
or somatic cell
nuclear transfer, SCNT.

00:07:28.633 --> 00:07:31.400
They take the nucleus
of a normal body cell,

00:07:31.433 --> 00:07:33.433
which contains all its DNA,

00:07:33.466 --> 00:07:35.200
and put it into an egg cell

00:07:35.233 --> 00:07:37.733
which has had
its own nucleus removed.

00:07:37.766 --> 00:07:40.266
So the egg cell
has its DNA replaced

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.700
and the idea is that
the new egg cell will develop

00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:47.533
into an organism with
identical DNA to the original.

00:07:47.566 --> 00:07:50.660
You've probably heard
of Dolly the sheep.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.666
She was the first animal
to be cloned this way.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.366
Of course,
this isn't just science fiction.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.133
Genetic modification and cloning

00:07:58.166 --> 00:08:00.800
are being used for all sorts
of things right now.

00:08:00.833 --> 00:08:04.166
We often refer to this
as biotechnology.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.466
Biotechnology is technology
based on biology.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.300
Up next, we visit scientists
in their labs

00:08:12.333 --> 00:08:15.366
to see some
biotechnology in action.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.233
So genetic modification
is based on the idea

00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:20.500
of copying a gene

00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:24.500
and placing it inside
another organism or cell.

00:08:24.533 --> 00:08:27.733
By copying genes
and attaching them to a vector,

00:08:27.766 --> 00:08:31.433
new genes can be added
to an organism's genetic code.

00:08:31.466 --> 00:08:36.300
Scientists can also
clone genes or organisms.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.400
One of the most exciting areas
of genetic research

00:08:50.433 --> 00:08:54.133
applies to the health
and well-being of humans.

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:57.330
So how can doctors
use genetic manipulation?

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.133
Imagine being able
to cure a disease

00:09:00.166 --> 00:09:03.600
by changing
a person's genetic code.

00:09:03.633 --> 00:09:07.660
Already scientists can identify
the genes that cause

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:11.000
some diseases and then work
on changing those genes.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.733
Heidi Peters
is a doctor and scientist

00:09:13.766 --> 00:09:16.100
at the Royal Children's Hospital
in Melbourne.

00:09:16.133 --> 00:09:17.466
She works with children

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.866
who have an unusual problem
with their livers.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.300
- So I work on a condition
called methylmalonic aciduria.

00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:28.700
And that's a disorder
of organic acid metabolism.

00:09:28.733 --> 00:09:31.100
It's inherited, it's rare,

00:09:31.133 --> 00:09:36.000
and it's a problem
with the breakdown of certain--

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.766
with the breakdown
of protein, really,

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.800
and certain amino acids.

00:09:39.833 --> 00:09:41.366
So you have
an enzyme that's missing,

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:46.966
and that enzyme causes
methylmalonic aciduria--

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.233
acid to be built up in the body

00:09:50.266 --> 00:09:53.300
and causes
the patient to become unwell.

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:56.660
I look after patients with
rare metabolic disorders,

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.333
and as part of that,
you become frustrated

00:10:01.366 --> 00:10:05.000
that there's no new, novel
therapies for these patients,

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.330
and you have a very limited
amount of treatment available.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.700
And I guess that's
sort of driven me

00:10:09.733 --> 00:10:13.300
to want to look at development
of novel therapies

00:10:13.333 --> 00:10:18.660
to try and help treat
these patients.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.366
- So Heidi works
with children who have MMA,

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.366
and she also does
research in the lab

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.433
to try to find a treatment
for the disease.

00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:29.166
The first part of her research

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.300
involves transplanting
healthy liver cells into mice.

00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:35.400
- So the mice are a model

00:10:35.433 --> 00:10:37.633
for the condition
that I'm interested in,

00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:39.400
so the methylmalonic aciduria,

00:10:39.433 --> 00:10:43.600
and these mice
are transgenic mice,

00:10:43.633 --> 00:10:47.000
and they have a phenotype,

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.700
or they have characteristics
that would be similar

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:53.200
to a mild form
of the MMA condition.

00:10:53.233 --> 00:10:56.366
- So these mice
have had a gene inserted

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.660
that gives them
a mild form of MMA.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.000
They're transgenic.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.800
Heidi's team transplants
healthy cells into the mice.

00:11:05.833 --> 00:11:08.566
The transplanted cells
produce the missing enzyme,

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.600
so that's one way MMA
could be treated.

00:11:11.633 --> 00:11:13.800
The next step is to genetically
change the cells

00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:17.330
before they're transplanted.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.166
- So one way is to take
the cells for transplant,

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.166
treat them with a viral
gene therapy vector

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.566
or a nonviral approach and--
so that they overexpress

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.433
the gene of interest,
so, in this case, the MMA gene--

00:11:35.466 --> 00:11:38.933
and then to transplant those
enhanced cells into the liver

00:11:38.966 --> 00:11:41.466
so that each cell
will be more effective

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.166
than if you just transplanted
non-enhanced cells.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.700
The thing that's exciting
for gene therapy is that--

00:11:48.733 --> 00:11:54.700
the potential to improve
patients' health, really.

00:11:58.133 --> 00:12:00.900
- Gene therapy
is the insertion of a gene

00:12:00.933 --> 00:12:03.366
into an individual's cells.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.466
The idea
is that hereditary diseases

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.660
can be treated by adding
a new healthy gene.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.333
Heidi's team are planning
to treat healthy liver cells

00:12:12.366 --> 00:12:14.330
with a gene
that will make them produce

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.533
even more of the missing enzyme.

00:12:16.566 --> 00:12:19.166
Then they'll put the cells
into the patients,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.200
well, mice at this stage.

00:12:22.233 --> 00:12:25.933
- So with viral gene therapy,
you are putting in--

00:12:25.966 --> 00:12:29.900
using a virus to deliver
a gene of interest

00:12:29.933 --> 00:12:31.366
that may not be
working properly,

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.266
or you want to overexpress,
essentially,

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:41.330
into a cell or into a body
or into an organ

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:45.466
so that it can then
start functioning.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.200
So that's one form
of gene therapy.

00:12:49.233 --> 00:12:50.800
What I enjoy about the work

00:12:50.833 --> 00:12:54.300
is that it gives me
the opportunity

00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:58.733
to be able to sort of study
something that might be able

00:12:58.766 --> 00:13:01.466
to be of benefit
for treating patients.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.166
I think really
that's what drives me.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.666
The aim would be to improve
their life, essentially,

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.266
to reduce the burden
of the disease

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.233
on that patient and that family.

00:13:13.266 --> 00:13:16.333
Hopefully, give them
a better quality of life

00:13:16.366 --> 00:13:18.900
and a longer life.

00:13:18.933 --> 00:13:20.933
- So you can see
there are already

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:24.533
some exciting medical uses
of genetic modification.

00:13:24.566 --> 00:13:26.633
Gene therapy
could also treat diseases

00:13:26.666 --> 00:13:29.566
like muscular dystrophy
or cystic fibrosis,

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.600
and there's a lot more research
going on around the world.

00:13:34.633 --> 00:13:37.466
There's also
xenotransplantation.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.600
That's when animals are used
to grow human organs.

00:13:40.633 --> 00:13:42.333
Many people die each year

00:13:42.366 --> 00:13:44.266
because of a lack
of donor organs,

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.833
but transgenic pigs
could provide a good source

00:13:46.866 --> 00:13:48.266
of humanlike organs

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.233
that wouldn't be rejected
by human immune systems.

00:13:52.266 --> 00:13:54.900
Scientists can
also use biotechnology

00:13:54.933 --> 00:13:56.800
to create proteins
in their laboratory

00:13:56.833 --> 00:13:59.566
for medical use.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.700
The insulin diabetics
need to survive

00:14:01.733 --> 00:14:04.300
used to be sourced from pigs.

00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:05.866
Thanks to biotechnology,

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.800
insulin is now made
in a laboratory

00:14:07.833 --> 00:14:11.866
by inserting artificial genes
into bacteria.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.600
The bacteria then produce
the vital insulin needed

00:14:14.633 --> 00:14:17.700
to help keep people
with diabetes alive.

00:14:17.733 --> 00:14:21.666
These proteins are called
recombinant proteins.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.330
This technology already
has a wide range

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.330
of medical and scientific uses.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.366
There are a number of medical
uses of genetic manipulation.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.200
Gene therapy involves
adding a gene to a cell

00:14:34.233 --> 00:14:37.100
in order to treat
an inherited condition.

00:14:37.133 --> 00:14:39.166
The gene can then produce
a protein

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.333
that was previously missing
or faulty in that cell.

00:14:43.366 --> 00:14:45.833
Other techniques
now being researched include

00:14:45.866 --> 00:14:50.333
creating human proteins using
modified bacteria or animals

00:14:50.366 --> 00:14:52.330
and xenotransplantation.

00:15:02.666 --> 00:15:05.600
Of course, genetics doesn't
just apply to humans.

00:15:05.633 --> 00:15:10.000
All animals and plants have DNA.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.866
Genetic modification
also offers exciting ways

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.233
to protect animals from disease.

00:15:15.266 --> 00:15:16.466
Let's take a look inside

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.633
the CSIRO's Australian
Animal Health Labs.

00:15:19.666 --> 00:15:23.900
Kathleen McLachlan
is a PhD student there.

00:15:23.933 --> 00:15:27.133
- My research is in developing
better ways to protect livestock

00:15:27.166 --> 00:15:28.833
from viruses
which cause disease,

00:15:28.866 --> 00:15:30.600
and the way
that I've been doing this

00:15:30.633 --> 00:15:34.100
is to use a new technology
called RNA interference.

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:36.300
The major benefit
of RNA interference

00:15:36.333 --> 00:15:39.533
is that you can
specifically silence genes.

00:15:39.566 --> 00:15:41.700
- Kathleen is working
on finding ways

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:44.433
to stop disease in farm animals.

00:15:44.466 --> 00:15:48.833
In her lab, they're studying
something call RNA interference.

00:15:48.866 --> 00:15:50.166
To put it simply,

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.200
they're using
the natural response of cells

00:15:52.233 --> 00:15:55.600
against viruses
to silence genes.

00:15:55.633 --> 00:15:59.166
- Gene silencing is when you
switch off a gene.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.133
So you have a gene
that's normally active,

00:16:01.166 --> 00:16:02.700
and we call that switched on,

00:16:02.733 --> 00:16:04.400
and you use RNA interference

00:16:04.433 --> 00:16:07.233
to silence the gene,
or switch it off.

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:10.233
So if you think of it like
a dimmer-style light switch,

00:16:10.266 --> 00:16:13.233
when the gene's normally active,
the light is at its brightest.

00:16:13.266 --> 00:16:15.633
When you use RNA interference
to silence the gene,

00:16:15.666 --> 00:16:17.300
you decrease protein production,

00:16:17.333 --> 00:16:20.266
and it's like turning down
the dimmer light switch.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.233
And then if you completely
silence the gene

00:16:22.266 --> 00:16:23.700
and there's
no protein production,

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.333
it's like the light
is switched off,

00:16:25.366 --> 00:16:26.866
and the gene's silenced.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.500
- So by turning off,
or silencing,

00:16:29.533 --> 00:16:31.133
a gene within the virus,

00:16:31.166 --> 00:16:33.400
Kathleen's team is working
to prevent the virus

00:16:33.433 --> 00:16:37.100
from infecting animal cells.

00:16:37.133 --> 00:16:40.600
They're trying to block
the conversion of RNA to protein

00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:45.000
for a particular gene that
the virus needs to infect cells.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.900
Right now, they're working
on protecting chickens,

00:16:47.933 --> 00:16:49.933
but who knows what kind
of vaccines

00:16:49.966 --> 00:16:53.300
this research might lead to.

00:16:53.333 --> 00:16:57.133
Agricultural science is a really
important area of research.

00:16:57.166 --> 00:16:59.866
It's all about making
farm animals and crops

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:04.266
stronger and healthier
to create food for more people.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.330
It's now possible to select
desirable characteristics

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.533
for a crop.

00:17:08.566 --> 00:17:12.660
So maybe you need a plant
that grows in salty soil

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.500
or very cold weather.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.966
Scientists can identify
and transfer genes

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.466
that make a plant resistant
to certain conditions

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.100
into another crop.

00:17:20.133 --> 00:17:22.800
These genes
are transferred to vectors

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:26.366
that can transfer
into the plant's cells.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.666
We call these transgenic plants.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.166
Transgenic organisms
are those that have a gene

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.133
transferred
from another species.

00:17:35.166 --> 00:17:38.566
In nature, genes are sometimes
passed between species,

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.200
but this happens
over a long, long time.

00:17:42.233 --> 00:17:46.866
In a laboratory,
it's a much speedier process.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:52.133
Transgenic crops can be
engineered to be pest resistant.

00:17:52.166 --> 00:17:55.166
It's also possible
to create transgenic animals

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.330
by transferring a gene
from one species to another.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.833
Transgenic cows
can have a gene inserted

00:18:01.866 --> 00:18:05.966
to make them produce more milk
or milk with less cholesterol.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.533
There are transgenic sheep
that produce more wool

00:18:09.566 --> 00:18:12.500
and cattle
that produce better meat.

00:18:12.533 --> 00:18:15.300
Scientists are
using these technologies

00:18:15.333 --> 00:18:19.330
to figure out ways to increase
farmers' yields and profits.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.833
The hope here is that they'll
be able to feed more people

00:18:21.866 --> 00:18:26.000
using less land, less water,
and fewer chemicals.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.633
Genetic manipulation
can allow scientists

00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:33.833
to grow stronger, bigger,
and healthier crops and animals.

00:18:33.866 --> 00:18:38.166
Scientists can transfer genes
from one species to another.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.200
This produces transgenic crops
and animals.

00:18:42.233 --> 00:18:43.400
They can select genes

00:18:43.433 --> 00:18:46.633
that make crops grow
in difficult conditions.

00:18:46.666 --> 00:18:49.100
They can also use
genetic manipulation

00:18:49.133 --> 00:18:53.400
to protect crops and animals
from disease or pests.

00:19:03.566 --> 00:19:05.533
It's not just
people and industry

00:19:05.566 --> 00:19:08.000
that benefit from
genetic manipulation.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.266
Genetic technologies
can also play a big role

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.900
in keeping our environment
safe and clean.

00:19:13.933 --> 00:19:17.166
We've already seen
how transgenic crops

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.333
can help farmers grow more food
in harsh conditions,

00:19:20.366 --> 00:19:22.666
but this technology
can also be used

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.433
to conserve
sensitive environments.

00:19:25.466 --> 00:19:29.233
Dr. John Patterson has
good reason to be interested

00:19:29.266 --> 00:19:32.733
in helping farmers
and the environment.

00:19:32.766 --> 00:19:36.366
- So I grew up in the country
on a farm, in East Gippsland

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.833
and had always wanted to get
into agricultural research.

00:19:40.866 --> 00:19:43.633
- Today
John is working to create

00:19:43.666 --> 00:19:48.200
crops that can survive
in areas that are dry and salty.

00:19:48.233 --> 00:19:49.500
- The main goals of our research

00:19:49.533 --> 00:19:52.600
is to develop crops
with improved tolerances

00:19:52.633 --> 00:19:54.166
to different
environmental stresses,

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.833
so things like
drought and salinity,

00:19:55.866 --> 00:19:58.266
which are major issues
for Australian farmers.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.533
The work that I do focuses on
looking at the proteins

00:20:01.566 --> 00:20:04.466
and how the proteins
in different plants respond--

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.800
change in response
to different stresses.

00:20:06.833 --> 00:20:09.400
If we can identify proteins

00:20:09.433 --> 00:20:14.533
that allow a plant to survive in
a dry or a saline environment,

00:20:14.566 --> 00:20:17.366
we can use that information
to develop improved varieties

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.800
that might express that protein,
or that gene,

00:20:20.833 --> 00:20:27.433
and use that to prove
the tolerance of other plants.

00:20:27.466 --> 00:20:29.566
- John identifies plants
that are tolerant

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.833
to dry or salty conditions.

00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:34.966
He compares the genome of these
to plants that can't survive

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.333
in the same
dry, salty conditions.

00:20:38.366 --> 00:20:40.866
By doing this,
John can figure out

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.166
which genes might
be the ones that make a plant

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.266
tolerant to drought or salinity.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.533
- The next step,
once we identify these genes,

00:20:48.566 --> 00:20:50.700
is to put them
into intolerant varieties

00:20:50.733 --> 00:20:53.600
and see if they have any effect
on improving

00:20:53.633 --> 00:20:56.233
the drought tolerance
of those plants.

00:20:56.266 --> 00:20:57.833
So the way we do that
is through a process

00:20:57.866 --> 00:21:00.666
of transgenesis where
we actually insert the genes

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.660
that we think are interesting

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.366
into these intolerant varieties
and look at the effects.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.666
So these types of approaches
are looking very promising,

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.433
and we are in the process
of developing some crops

00:21:11.466 --> 00:21:13.400
with some important
agricultural traits

00:21:13.433 --> 00:21:16.566
that will have benefits
for Australian farmers.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.266
The research that
I've talked about today

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.466
does have a number of positive
impacts on the environment

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.566
as well as
the economic benefits.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.333
By creating varieties
of crops that have

00:21:26.366 --> 00:21:28.800
improved drought tolerance
or improved salinity tolerance,

00:21:28.833 --> 00:21:31.400
we can grow more crop
in less area of land.

00:21:31.433 --> 00:21:34.266
So we can use less land
for agricultural productivity,

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.733
and also we use less water

00:21:35.766 --> 00:21:37.366
to grow the same amount
of crops.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.100
I really hope that we can
identify some genes

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:44.266
and then use this information
to develop some varieties

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.900
with really improved
water use efficiency

00:21:46.933 --> 00:21:48.330
and drought tolerance

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.600
and get that research
out into the field

00:21:49.633 --> 00:21:53.660
so that farmers can actually
use this information.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.966
- John's work has economic,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.266
social,
and environmental impacts,

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.766
and he's not alone.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.660
Scientists around the world

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.733
are working
on similar genetic technologies.

00:22:03.766 --> 00:22:07.200
Many industries produce
pollution that finds its way

00:22:07.233 --> 00:22:10.660
into our waterways, our air,
and our soil.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:14.633
Biotechnology is finding ways
to clean up contaminated areas.

00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:18.200
One involves phytoremediation.

00:22:18.233 --> 00:22:20.966
Phytoremediation is a way
of cleaning up pollution

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.660
using plants that are able

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.300
to break down
polluting chemicals.

00:22:25.333 --> 00:22:29.633
Biotechnology allows scientists
to find genes from these species

00:22:29.666 --> 00:22:31.500
and put them
into another species

00:22:31.533 --> 00:22:34.330
better suited
to the cleanup site.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.300
So cleaning up oil spills
in the ocean, for example,

00:22:37.333 --> 00:22:40.800
is becoming much
faster and more effective.

00:22:40.833 --> 00:22:43.666
This technology,
called bioremediation,

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.633
uses genetically
modified bacteria

00:22:45.666 --> 00:22:47.533
to clean up toxic spills

00:22:47.566 --> 00:22:50.900
or turn waste
into less harmful chemicals.

00:22:50.933 --> 00:22:53.466
Another big problem
in natural environments

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.800
is invasive species.

00:22:55.833 --> 00:22:58.300
Genetic technologies
are already being tested

00:22:58.333 --> 00:23:01.433
on preventing
the spread of some pests.

00:23:01.466 --> 00:23:03.166
Daughterless carp and toads

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.330
have been developed
in Australian laboratories.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.300
By genetically modifying
the pest species

00:23:08.333 --> 00:23:10.133
so they can't reproduce,

00:23:10.166 --> 00:23:14.300
their environmental impact
can be dramatically reduced.

00:23:14.333 --> 00:23:16.833
Genetic manipulation
can play a role

00:23:16.866 --> 00:23:19.566
in conserving our environment.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.233
Work on drought-
and salinity-tolerant crops

00:23:22.266 --> 00:23:26.533
can help the agriculture
industry and the environment.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.600
For many people
in the community,

00:23:38.633 --> 00:23:42.433
genetic manipulation offers
new and exciting technology,

00:23:42.466 --> 00:23:43.866
medical miracles,

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.800
or better
environmental protection.

00:23:46.833 --> 00:23:50.966
But new science and technology
always comes with fears.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.200
Is it really okay to change
the genetic code?

00:23:55.233 --> 00:23:57.133
Who should decide
what the limits

00:23:57.166 --> 00:23:59.100
to genetic engineering are?

00:23:59.133 --> 00:24:01.700
It can be
a very emotional topic.

00:24:01.733 --> 00:24:03.200
Like all new science,

00:24:03.233 --> 00:24:05.700
researchers work hard
to test these technologies

00:24:05.733 --> 00:24:09.366
in the laboratory before they
are used out in the real world.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.900
Many people have concerns

00:24:10.933 --> 00:24:14.000
about the risks
of changing the genes of crops.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.533
They're concerned
about long-term health risks

00:24:16.566 --> 00:24:19.866
and also about effects
on biodiversity.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.466
One major concern
is cross-pollination.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.533
Since the pollen of some plants
can be spread so widely

00:24:26.566 --> 00:24:28.800
by wind, insects, or birds,

00:24:28.833 --> 00:24:32.500
it's difficult to control
how plants interbreed.

00:24:32.533 --> 00:24:35.366
If the pollen
of a genetically modified plant

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.000
is spread to normal plants,

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:41.766
the new characteristic
will appear in other plants too.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.933
This isn't always a problem.

00:24:43.966 --> 00:24:45.533
But it is important to consider

00:24:45.566 --> 00:24:48.500
what the long-term
effects might be.

00:24:48.533 --> 00:24:49.800
For example,

00:24:49.833 --> 00:24:52.366
what if we make some crops
resistant to herbicide

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.700
and this trait spreads
to nearby weeds?

00:24:55.733 --> 00:24:58.233
Some people think that the risks
of genetic manipulation

00:24:58.266 --> 00:24:59.933
are too great.

00:24:59.966 --> 00:25:04.566
Others say it's unethical and
that humans shouldn't play God.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.733
Ethics and safety

00:25:05.766 --> 00:25:09.900
are an important
consideration in biotechnology.

00:25:09.933 --> 00:25:11.566
With genetic manipulation,

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.660
it's important to consider
all the outcomes

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:18.100
and to test the technology
well before it's applied.

00:25:18.133 --> 00:25:20.966
But problems arise when people
disagree on the ethics

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.200
of a new technology.

00:25:23.233 --> 00:25:24.866
For example,

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.500
we all know it's unfair
for athletes to cheat

00:25:27.533 --> 00:25:29.633
and that's why competitions
like the Olympics

00:25:29.666 --> 00:25:33.330
have rules against using drugs
to enhance performance.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.500
But consider gene doping.

00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:37.800
That's when genes
or genetic material

00:25:37.833 --> 00:25:41.300
are used to improve a person's
athletic performance.

00:25:41.333 --> 00:25:44.733
At the moment, it's impossible
to test for gene doping.

00:25:44.766 --> 00:25:48.166
It doesn't involve using drugs,
but is it ethical?

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.233
Other questions about the ethics
of genetic manipulation

00:25:51.266 --> 00:25:52.866
focus on the potential
of parents

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.660
to select characteristics
of their baby.

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.200
If this were possible,
would some traits disappear?

00:25:59.233 --> 00:26:01.400
And is it ethical?

00:26:01.433 --> 00:26:03.366
If gene therapy
and other treatments

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.666
become widely available,

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.866
will they be provided
to everyone,

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.300
or will people with more money
be the only ones

00:26:09.333 --> 00:26:13.330
who can extend their
good health and their lives?

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.666
Genetic manipulation
has great potential

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.433
to improve our lives
for the better,

00:26:17.466 --> 00:26:19.466
but there are definitely
some big questions

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.766
to be asked along the way.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.966
It's important to consider the
ethics and all possible outcomes

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.100
of using new technologies
and treatments.

00:26:29.133 --> 00:26:31.200
Scientists work
to test the impacts

00:26:31.233 --> 00:26:32.900
of any genetic modification

00:26:32.933 --> 00:26:36.266
before it's used
outside the lab.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.733
One concern is that humans
shouldn't be playing God

00:26:39.766 --> 00:26:42.700
by changing their genome
or that this technology

00:26:42.733 --> 00:26:46.660
will not be available
equally to everyone.

00:26:56.766 --> 00:27:00.300
Genetic manipulation
is a very recent science,

00:27:00.333 --> 00:27:02.700
and we're still in the early
stages of figuring out

00:27:02.733 --> 00:27:04.866
how it can be used.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.200
In this program,

00:27:06.233 --> 00:27:08.266
we've seen how manipulating
the genetic code

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.000
can have applications
in human, agricultural,

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.200
and environmental health
and science.

00:27:14.233 --> 00:27:17.900
This technology also has
economic and social impacts,

00:27:17.933 --> 00:27:20.433
so the possibilities
of genetic manipulation

00:27:20.466 --> 00:27:24.660
are extremely far reaching.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.733
By understanding the way
genetic manipulation works

00:27:27.766 --> 00:27:29.300
as well as its potential,

00:27:29.333 --> 00:27:31.166
we can all play an informed role

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.133
in making decisions
about the future of science.
