WEBVTT

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.930
(MALE NARRATOR)
TODDLERS ARE ACTIVE,
IMPULSIVE AND EMOTIONAL.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.930
THAT'S THE KIND
OF BEHAVIOR

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:51.860
YOU EXPECT FROM
A TWO- OR THREE-YEAR OLD.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.930
BUT WHEN AN OLDER CHILD
CONTINUES TO BEHAVE THAT WAY,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.260
HE MAY BE SUSPECTED
OF HAVING

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:09.930
ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY
DISORDER OR ADHD.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.630
AT AGE THREE,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.660
I TOOK MY CHILDREN
TO DAYCARE FOR THE FIRST TIME.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.000
I STARTED GETTING THESE
COMPLAINTS FROM THE TEACHER

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.660
ABOUT THE CHILDREN
MISBEHAVING,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.960
PUSHING
OTHER CHILDREN,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.560
NOT LISTENING
TO THE OTHER ADULTS.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.160
THEN AT AGE FOUR,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.300
I TOOK THEM
TO A LARGER CENTER.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.660
I THOUGHT MAYBE IF
I WOULD SEPARATE THE BOYS

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.560
THAT THAT WOULD
BE BETTER FOR THEM.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.460
AND THEY SPENT THE DAY

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.900
LOOKING FOR EACH OTHER
AND MISBEHAVING.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.230
THE TEACHERS COMPLAINED

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.300
AND SO I THOUGHT,
"THIS IS NEW FOR THEM,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.800
THEY'RE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO BEING
AROUND ALL THESE CHILDREN."

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.430
IT WAS VERY TRAUMATIC FOR
THE CHILDREN IN KINDERGARTEN.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.800
THEY WERE NOT ABLE
TO FOLLOW THE RULES,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.960
THEY WERE SASSING
THE TEACHERS,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.100
THEY WERE PUSHING
AND HITTING,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.700
NOT ABLE
TO WAIT IN LINE,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.430
VERY IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.200
I THOUGHT, I NEED
TO TAKE THEM TO THE DOCTOR.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.260
AND THE TEACHERS
HAD OBSERVED

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.300
THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR
IN OTHER CHILDREN

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.760
AND SUGGESTED MAYBE THE BOYS
WERE ADHD OR ADD

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.030
AND I HAD NEVER HEARD
OF THESE TERMS, OF COURSE.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.460
(NARRATOR)
BACK IN THE 1940S,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.530
THE ADHD CHILD
WAS MISUNDERSTOOD,

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.430
EVEN LABELED,
"MENTALLY RETARDED."

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.200
AND AFTER SEVERAL
DECADES OF RESEARCH

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.000
AND A BETTER
UNDERSTANDING,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.160
IT'S STILL A DISORDER
SURROUNDED BY CONTROVERSY.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.260
THERE ARE STILL
SOME PEOPLE--

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.800
THEY KNOW ABOUT
HYPERACTIVITY--

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.660
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ATTENTION DEFICIT

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.700
AND THEY THINK THAT IT'S POOR
MOTIVATION OR BAD ATTITUDE,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.200
AND THAT WE'VE LOST SOME OF OUR
BEING STRICT WITH KIDS.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200
THINGS ARE
TOO SOFT NOWADAYS.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.830
IF WE GET STRICT WITH THEM
AND GET TOUGH,

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.830
WE WOULDN'T
HAVE ALL THIS.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.260
I THINK ONE OF THE--

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.800
THAT OUR SCHOOL
DISTRICT FACES--

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.900
IS THE ISSUE OF A NUMBER
OF MINORITY STUDENTS

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.760
BEING IDENTIFIED
FOR ADHD.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.560
AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING
AT IS A GROUP OF KIDS

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.300
THAT MAY NOT CULTURALLY FIT
WITHIN A CLASSROOM.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.130
AND BECAUSE
THEY DON'T FIT,

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.160
THEIR BEHAVIOR
IS SEEN AS

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.560
NOT BEING ABLE
TO PAY ATTENTION,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.060
BEING IMPULSIVE,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.760
NOT FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS
THAT TEACHERS GIVE THEM,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.730
BEING JUST GENERALLY
DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH,

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.160
AND AS A RESULT
OF THAT,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.900
BEING REFERRED
FOR POSSIBLE ADHD.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.300
SOMETHING HAS
TO BE GOING ON

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.930
FOR A CHILD TO DISPLAY
THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.530
AND I'M CONVINCED NOW.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.730
I THOUGHT THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I'M NOT DOING.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.830
BUT TO SEE THE CHANGE
IN THE BOYS

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.930
FROM WHEN THEY WERE NOT
TAKING THE MEDICATION AND NOW,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.030
I KNOW THAT IT HAS TO BE
A PHYSIOLOGICAL KIND OF PROBLEM.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.260
(NARRATOR)
PART OF THE PROBLEM

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.500
IS IN THE WAY
THE DISORDER IS DIAGNOSED.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.160
ATTENTION DEFICIT
HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.930
IS A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.430
THERE AREN'T ANY TESTS
YOU CAN ORDER.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.430
YOU CAN'T SEND A CHILD
INTO A DOCTOR

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.830
AND EXPECT HIM
TO SEND YOU TO THE LAB,

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.160
GET A BLOOD TEST,
EKG, OR CAT SCAN

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.760
AND DIAGNOSE
THE PROBLEM.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.930
IT'S A DIAGNOSIS MADE
BY TAKING HISTORY

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.930
AND WHAT YOU DO IS ASK
ABOUT KEY SYMPTOMS

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.530
AND IF A CHILD HAS THE RIGHT
NUMBER OF SYMPTOMS,

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.730
THEN HE MEETS THE CRITERIA
FOR THE DIAGNOSIS.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.600
IT IS BASICALLY
A DIAGNOSIS MADE

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.360
BY CAREFUL EXAMINATION
OF THE BEHAVIORS OF THE CHILD.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.100
AND YOU LEARN THIS THROUGH
TALKING WITH PARENTS, TEACHERS,

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.530
OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN
THE CHILD'S ENVIRONMENT.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.960
(NARRATOR)
WHAT KINDS OF BEHAVIORS
ARE THEY WATCHING FOR?

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.230
WELL, FIRST, IS THE CHILD
EASILY DISTRACTED?

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.030
DOES HE HAVE
A HARD TIME

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.460
PAYING ATTENTION,
STAYING ON TASK?

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.230
ONE THING I SEE

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.160
IS A CHILD WHO
MAY NOT BE ABLE

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.800
TO SIT DOWN
FOR A LONG TIME

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.230
AND ANSWER QUESTIONS--

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.400
WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO SIT AND WRITE.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.860
WHEN IT'S ONE ACTIVITY

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.060
YOU'RE ASKING
THEM TO DO

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.960
FOR LONGER THAN
FIVE MINUTES,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.830
THAT'S OFTEN
DIFFICULT FOR THEM.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.460
THEY FIDGET, THEY STAND,
THEY TWIRL PENCILS,

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.730
THEY TAP,
THEY TWITCH THEIR FEET.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.200
SOMETIMES THEY DAYDREAM
OR STARE OFF INTO SPACE

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.400
OR THEY JUST
DON'T GIVE YOU

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.130
ANY OF THE NORMAL
ATTENDING BEHAVIORS

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.730
THAT YOU SEE IN GENERAL
IN THE CLASSROOM.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.300
THEN PEOPLE WILL SAY,

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.700
"IT MUST NOT BE
ATTENTION DEFICIT.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.900
"HE OR SHE CAN CONCENTRATE
FOR A LONG TIME,

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.930
I'VE SEEN THEM
WATCH CARTOONS."

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.560
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
REALLY EXCITES THEM

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.000
BUT YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW
A PERSON'S PERFORMANCE LEVEL

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.430
IN TERMS
OF CONCENTRATING

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.100
UNTIL THEY HAVE
TO DO A TASK

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.330
THAT ISN'T REALLY
INTERESTING TO THEM.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.260
THAT'S WHEN YOUR ABILITY
TO FOCUS IS TESTED.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
YOU HAVE TO PULL ON
SOMETHING WITHIN YOU

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.560
TO KEEP YOUR
ATTENTION ON IT.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.600
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY,
YOU'RE GONNA FALL APART.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.760
(NARRATOR)
SECOND, IS THE CHILD
VERY EMOTIONAL OR EASILY UPSET?

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.900
MY BOYS,
PARTICULARLY ONE OF THEM,

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.900
HE HAS ALL OF THAT

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.530
AND IT'S FRIGHTENING IN A SENSE
BECAUSE I GET CONCERNED.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.100
WHEN WILL IT END?

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.000
WHEN WILL HE
BE ABLE TO CONTROL IT?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.160
IN ALL FAIRNESS
TO HIM,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.760
HE IS CONTROLLING IT
MUCH BETTER NOW

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.660
THAN HE DID A YEAR AGO
OR TWO YEARS AGO--

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.830
TURNING OVER THE TABLE
IN THE PLAYROOM,

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.830
GETTING ANGRY
AND THROWING TOYS,

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.700
AND BODY JUST BECOMING
VERY, VERY RIGID,

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.560
JUST THE GRITTING OF THE TEETH
AND THE FISTS TOGETHER.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.800
I MEAN
EXTREMELY ANGRY.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.800
WHEN THIS CHILD
WAS UPSET,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.230
THE TEACHER EVACUATED
THE WHOLE CLASS

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.360
UNTIL SOMEBODY CAME DOWN
TO WORK WITH THIS CHILD.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.130
THAT WAS
THE PROCESS.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.560
THE CHILD WOULD
LITERALLY CLIMB WALLS

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.300
AND LITERALLY CLIMB ON DESKS
AND START THROWING THINGS

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.960
AND IT MAY
HAVE STARTED OFF

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.730
BY JUST SOMEBODY INVADING
HIS PERSONAL SPACE,

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.360
SOMEBODY TOUCHING
HIS DESK.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.630
THE KID WITH
ATTENTION DEFICIT PROBLEMS,

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.400
IT'S LIKE ALL
THE CHANNELS ARE OPEN.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.200
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHEN THINGS
ARE POURING IN AT YOU,

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.230
ANYBODY TENDS TO GET
PRETTY IRRITABLE AND SENSITIVE.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.630
AND WE OFTEN SAY
TO A TEACHER,

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.700
"HOW DO YOU FEEL
WHEN SIX KIDS

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.030
ARE TRYING TO GET
YOUR ATTENTION?"

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.560
YOU GET
PRETTY IRRITATED.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.530
IT REALLY GETS YOU
IN THIS IRRITABLE MOOD.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.200
THIS IS HOW THESE KIDS
FEEL ALL THE TIME.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.000
IF YOU WANT
TO UNDERSTAND

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.900
EMOTIONAL VOLATILITY
OR OVERAROUSAL,

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.930
YOU HAVE TO REALIZE
THEY'RE NOT ABLE

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.930
TO BE SELECTIVE ABOUT WHAT
THEY'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:14.600
(NARRATOR)
AND THIRD, IS HE
IMPULSIVE OR AGGRESSIVE?

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.160
(TEACHER)
IT'S CHILDREN WHO--

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.500
IF THEY GET INTO
A SITUATION WITH A FRIEND

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.100
WHO ACCIDENTALLY
TAPPED THEM ON THE BACK

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.930
OR A PENCIL
GOT FLUNG--

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.500
THEY REACT
WITHOUT THINKING.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.830
YOU SEE THAT
WITH WORDS, BEHAVIORS.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.000
A LOT OF PROBLEMS
WITH JUST STANDING IN LINE

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.160
BECAUSE IF ANYONE
DOES ANYTHING WRONG--

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.230
IT'S SO EASY IN THOSE
KINDS OF SETTINGS

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.100
FOR THINGS
TO GO WRONG.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.100
IT'S JUST THAT ACTING OUT
YOUR FIRST FEELING.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.600
THEY HAVE THIS INTENSE NEED
TO EXPLORE THEIR WORLD

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.930
AND THE WAY
THEY DO IT

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.930
IS BY ZOOMING FROM
ONE SPOT TO ANOTHER.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.000
THEY SAY, "CHECK THIS OUT.
THIS LOOKS COOL."

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.430
INTERACTING WITH
THEM BRIEFLY.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.530
I GOT IT, GOING ON
TO THE NEXT THING.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:01.130
WELL, THERE WAS THIS
RED KNOB ON THE WALL

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.460
DOWN AT THIS HEIGHT

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.200
AND ONE OF THE TWINS
WALKED OVER AND PULLED IT

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.800
AND THEN HE SAID,

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.760
"WHAT'S THAT?" AND
THAT WAS THE FIRE ALARM.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.800
THINGS LIKE THAT--
PUSHING BUTTONS,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.700
OR PULLING
THE FIRE ALARM.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.060
THAT'S HAPPENED
A COUPLE OF TIMES,

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.300
BECAUSE THEY WANT
TO KNOW WHAT IT IS

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:26.300
AND WILL DO IT AND
ASK YOU, "WHAT IS IT?"

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.960
(NARRATOR)
SOME EXPERTS THINK
THAT THE CAUSE OF ADHD

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.930
MAY BEGIN
IN THE BRAIN.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.530
IT'S NOT
BRAIN DAMAGE.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.960
IT'S PROBABLY RELATED
TO NEUROCHEMISTRY.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.930
THERE ARE NEUROTRANSMITTERS
IN THE BRAIN

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.300
AND RESEARCHERS FEEL THAT
THERE ARE DEFICITS OF THESE

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.560
NEUROTRANSMITTERS IN CERTAIN
AREAS OF THE BRAIN.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.700
THESE NEUROTRANSMITTERS
ACTUALLY HELP THE BRAIN WORK

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.860
AND IF THEY'RE IN INSUFFICIENT
QUANTITY OR QUALITY,

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.860
THEN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE BRAIN
ARE NOT AS FUNCTIONAL.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.900
YOU CAN'T SEE THAT
WHEN YOU DO AN X-RAY,

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.030
BUT IT WORKS
THAT WAY.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.600
(NARRATOR)
OVER THE YEARS,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.700
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS
BASED ON NUTRITION

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.360
HAVE BEEN EXPLORED.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.530
ONE DIET, DEVELOPED
BY BENJAMIN FEINGOLD,

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.030
INVOLVED ELIMINATING
CERTAIN CHEMICALS AND FOODS

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.600
FROM A CHILD'S DIET
AND ENVIRONMENT,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.600
THEN REINTRODUCING THEM
ONE AT A TIME

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.700
WHILE THE PARENTS
CAREFULLY OBSERVED

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.800
CHANGES IN
THE CHILD'S BEHAVIOR.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.200
CERTAINLY YOU FIND
THAT A CHILD

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.760
IS REPORTEDLY SENSITIVE
TO AN ITEM IN THE DIET

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.130
OR SOME ENVIRONMENTAL
TYPE OF AGENT.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.830
I THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER
REMOVING THAT AGENT

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.700
FROM THE DIET
OR FROM THE ENVIRONMENT

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.760
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
TO THE CHILD'S BEHAVIOR.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.030
I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP
SOME OPEN MIND.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.860
MEDICAL RESEARCH DOESN'T
SUPPORT THE FEINGOLD DIET,

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.530
THEREFORE, THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY
IS RELUCTANT TO SUPPORT THAT

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.630
AND I THINK
THAT'S RATIONAL.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:57.500
IN THE PAST, A LOT OF THEORIES
HAVE BEEN PROMOTED AND SOLD

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.200
AND PUSHED ON PEOPLE

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.730
WITHOUT GOOD EVIDENCE
OF THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:06.300
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
TRYING TO DO IN MEDICINE NOW

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.260
IS USE CONTROLLED STUDIES
TO SUPPORT OUR TREATMENT.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.560
AND I THINK ATTENTION
DEFICIT DISORDER

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.130
SHOULD BE TREATED
LIKE ANY OTHER DISEASE.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.660
WE NEED TO HAVE
CONTROLLED RESEARCH

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.730
TO PROVE OR DISPROVE
THAT THERAPY IS APPROPRIATE.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.800
OTHERWISE,
A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.330
GO THROUGH A LOT OF TROUBLE
WITH THESE DIETS

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.330
OR SPECIAL TREATMENTS,
HOMEOPATHIC TREATMENTS,

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:31.660
TO TRY TO ELIMINATE SYMPTOMS
WHEN IT REALLY IS NOT EFFECTIVE.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:36.600
(NARRATOR)
THE MOST COMMON TREATMENT
FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF ADHD

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.630
IS THE USE
OF STIMULANTS.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.900
IF YOU GIVE A CHILD,

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.000
WITH ATTENTION DEFICIT
HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER,
STIMULANT MEDICATION,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.860
THIS DECREASES
THEIR SYMPTOMS.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.130
AND WHAT STIMULANT MEDICATION
DOES IS IT INCREASES

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.400
THE CONCENTRATION
OF NOREPINEPHRINE

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.630
IN SOME OF THESE
NEUROTRANSMITTERS.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.300
(NARRATOR)
IT'S NOT A
"THOUGHT CONTROL" DRUG.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.600
IT DOESN'T MAKE A CHILD WANT
TO DO HOMEWORK OR COOPERATE.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.430
IT JUST HELPS HIM TO FOCUS
WHEN HE IS WORKING.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.630
IT'S NOT A PILL
TO MAKE YOU SMARTER;

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.530
IT'S NOT A PILL TO MAKE
YOU A BETTER PERSON.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:16.030
I THINK IT JUST HELPS THE CHILD
STAY WITH THE PROGRAM,

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:20.760
TO BE FOCUSED ENOUGH TO DO
OR ACCOMPLISH WHAT HE CAN DO.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.860
(NARRATOR)
THERE CAN BE SOME SIDE EFFECTS

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.200
ASSOCIATED WITH
USING STIMULANTS, HOWEVER.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.530
A DECREASE IN APPETITE,
PROBLEMS GETTING TO SLEEP,

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:33.030
AND INCREASED ANXIETY
CAN SOMETIMES BE A PROBLEM.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.760
AND IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT THE CHILD

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.860
IS TAKING
THE CORRECT DOSAGE.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.830
IF YOU RUN INTO
EXCESSIVE DOSES,

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:45.430
SOMETHING THAT A PARENT
OR TEACHER CAN LOOK FOR

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.930
IS EXCESSIVE SEDATION.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.330
CHILDREN BECOME
VERY SEDATE,

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.830
THEIR PERFORMANCE
FALLS OFF.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.530
IF YOU GO TOO FAR
WITH STIMULANTS,

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.260
INSTEAD OF IMPROVING THEIR
PERFORMANCE AND FUNCTION,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.660
YOU SEE A DECREASE
IN BOTH OF THOSE THINGS.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.060
I HAVE SEEN IT
BE EFFECTIVE.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.230
I CAN'T DENY THAT.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:06.160
I HAVE SEEN STIMULANTS
AFFECT CHILDREN

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160
IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.500
NOT EVERY CHILD.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.830
I'VE SEEN CHILDREN
WHO IT'S AFFECTED NEGATIVELY.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.400
WE HAVE TO LOOK
AT EACH CHILD

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.500
AND SAY,
"DO WE THINK IT CAN HELP?"

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.800
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
TRYING IT.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.700
BUT IT
SHOULDN'T BE USED

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.400
AS A SOLUTION
IN AND OF ITSELF.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:32.560
IT'S TOO EASY A CURE
TO PUT A CHILD ON MEDICATION

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.230
AND YOU MAY SEE SOME
IMPROVEMENT WITH THOSE CHILDREN,

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.900
BUT IS IT REALLY
GOING TO BE LONG TERM?

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.900
IS IT REALLY GOING
TO BE SOMETHING

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.630
THAT THE CHILD
INTERNALIZES?

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.900
(NARRATOR)
PROFESSIONALS AGREE
THAT USING PILLS

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:51.560
TO CONTROL ADHD BEHAVIORS
IS NOT BY ANY MEANS A CURE-ALL.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.630
IT'S ONLY AN AID
AND ONE SMALL FACET

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.930
IN THE TOTAL MANAGEMENT
OF THE ADHD CHILD.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.000
SOME CHILDREN MAY HAVE
A LEARNING DISABILITY

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.760
IN ADDITION TO ADHD.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.600
IF THAT'S
THE CASE,

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.360
THEY MAY NEED EXTRA HELP
IN READING OR MATH.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.600
SOME OF THE HARDEST KIDS
TO REALLY IDENTIFY

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.730
ARE THE VERY BRIGHT KIDS
WHO AREN'T HYPERACTIVE

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.260
BUT HAVE
ATTENTION DEFICIT

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.030
BECAUSE THEY LEARN
TO COMPENSATE FOR IT.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.400
THEY CAN GET BY,
AND DO JUST GOOD ENOUGH

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.500
AND PEOPLE TEND TO CALL THEM
UNDERACHIEVERS

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.630
AND WONDERING WHEN
THEY'RE GOING TO LIVE UP
TO THEIR POTENTIAL.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:33.330
A LOT OF THESE KIDS
HAVE THIS

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.860
SUBTLE ATTENTION
DEFICIT PROBLEM.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.030
THEY'RE NOT BOUNCING
OFF THE WALLS,

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.530
NOT DRIVING
PEOPLE CRAZY,

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.160
BUT THEY'RE BRILLIANT
AND NOT PERFORMING WELL,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.530
AND I'VE SEEN SEVERAL
OF THESE KIDS ON MEDICATION

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.800
REALLY BEGIN TO IMPROVE
THEIR PERFORMANCE.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.830
(NARRATOR)
SOCIAL SKILLS CAN
ALSO BE A PROBLEM

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.360
FOR CHILDREN
WITH ADHD.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.360
ONE OF THE TWINS
DIDN'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.230
EVERYBODY WAS
AFRAID OF HIM,

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.160
BECAUSE WHEN
HE'D GET ANGRY,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.830
HE WOULD PUSH, SHOVE,
PINCH AND KICK

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.760
AND DIDN'T HAVE
ANY FRIENDS

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.460
AND HIS SELF-ESTEEM
WAS EXTREMELY LOW.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.730
THE OTHER TWIN
WAS A LONER

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.560
AND DIDN'T HAVE
ANY FRIENDS

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.960
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT
TO BE BOTHERED WITH ANYONE.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.160
IT MAKES
A LOT OF SENSE

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.500
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE HAVING
TROUBLE FOCUSING,

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.900
YOU'RE NOT CATCHING THE SIGNALS
PEOPLE ARE SENDING YOU--

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.730
THE LOOK
ON SOMEONE'S FACE,

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.560
OR TELLING YOU
THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH,

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.060
OR "THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.630
LEAVE ME ALONE."

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:31.330
IF YOU MISS THAT AND CONTINUE
DOING WHAT YOU WERE DOING,

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.330
YOU'LL GET SOMEBODY MAD,
OR FRUSTRATED WITH YOU.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:35.860
AND BECAUSE
THEY'RE IMPULSIVE,

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.730
THEY DON'T STOP
AND THINK,

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.000
"WHAT WOULD BE
MY NEXT STRATEGY

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.560
TO GET ALONG BETTER."

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.960
THEY POKE AT SOMEONE

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.130
OR DO SOMETHING
BECAUSE THEY'RE DESPERATE

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.300
TO RECONNECT
WITH THAT PERSON.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.530
THEY TEND TO DO A LOT OF THINGS
THAT DON'T WORK.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.800
THE BOYS ATTEND
A SUPPORT GROUP AT SCHOOL

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.130
WITH ONE OF
THE SOCIAL WORKERS

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.360
AND THEY TALK ABOUT
BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.260
THEY TALK ABOUT HOW TO GET
ALONG WITH OTHER CHILDREN.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.200
WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU GET ANGRY?

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.760
WHAT ARE SOME
ALTERNATIVES

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.660
TO HITTING OR PUSHING
WHEN YOU GET ANGRY?

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.200
WHAT ARE
GOOD CHOICES?

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.760
(NARRATOR)
PARENTS AND SIBLINGS

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.400
MAY WANT TO JOIN
A SUPPORT GROUP

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.200
TO SHARE INFORMATION
AND FEELINGS.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.700
IT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING
BECAUSE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.260
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS GOING ON

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
UNTIL WE GOT THE DIAGNOSIS
AND THE EXPLANATION.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.530
MEETING WITH OTHER PARENTS
WAS WONDERFUL,

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.400
BECAUSE YOU MEET
OTHER PEOPLE

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.500
WHO ARE FEELING THE SAME
KIND OF GUILT THAT YOU FEEL.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.200
JUST NOT BEING
ADEQUATE AS A PERSON--

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.430
AND AS A PARENT,
VERY DIFFICULT.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.100
I'M SEEING A KID
OR A FAMILY--

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.030
I'M MAKING SURE
I BRING THE SIBLING IN

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.900
TO SEE HOW
THEY'RE DOING,

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.930
MAKE SURE TOO MUCH PRESSURE
ISN'T ON THEM.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.930
OFTEN THEY FEEL
THEY HAVE TO BE GOOD

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:56.000
BECAUSE "MOM AND DAD'S
HAVING A HARD TIME

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.160
WITH MY SIBLING."

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.230
AND ITUTS LOTS
OF PRESSURE ON THEM

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.230
BECAUSE THEY FEEL
THEY'VE GOT TO PERFORM WELL

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.730
OR THINGS
ARE UNFAIR

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.000
AND THEY'RE GETTING
A RAW DEAL.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
AND I THINK
IT'S IMPORTANT

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.130
WE FIND A BALANCE
FOR THEM

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.200
OF ASKING FOR
A LITTLE EXTRA FROM THEM

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.160
BECAUSE THEIR BROTHER
OR SISTER'S HAVING A PROBLEM.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.230
BUT ALSO MAKING SURE
THAT THEY'RE NOT CARRYING

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.130
AN ADULT LOAD
OF RESPONSIBILITY

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:25.530
AND MAKING SURE THAT
THEY'RE NOT DOING THE JOB

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.130
THAT THE PARENT
REALLY NEEDS TO DO.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.030
(NARRATOR)
PROFESSIONALS CAN ALSO OFFER

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.960
PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS
ON HOW PARENTS

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.030
CAN MAKE THINGS GO MORE
SMOOTHLY AT HOME.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.460
DISORGANIZATION
IS A PROBLEM

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.300
WITH KIDS
WHO GET DISTRACTED.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.960
IT'S HARD TO KEEP
TRACK OF THINGS.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.800
YOU SET OUT TO DO ONE THING
AND YOU FORGET.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.630
SOME PARENTS
WILL MAKE LISTS

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.630
THEY POST
ON THE DOOR.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:52.860
DO YOU HAVE
A) YOUR LUNCHBOX
B) YOUR BACKPACK

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.300
OR THEY'LL PUT A NOTE
ON THE KITCHEN DOOR

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.430
SO THE CHILD CAN'T LEAVE
WITHOUT SEEING THIS.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.500
SOMETHING A PARENT
CAN DO

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.700
IS MAKE THE TASKS
MORE SPECIFIC

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.160
AND THEN PROVIDE
ENCOURAGEMENT.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.900
SO IT'S NOT,
"GO CLEAN YOUR ROOM."

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.500
BUT IT'S,
"PICK UP ALL THE CLOTHING

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.160
"AND PUT IT IN
THIS LAUNDRY BASKET.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.730
"EXCELLENT YOU
DID THAT.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.030
LET'S MOVE ONTO
THE NEXT STEP."

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.430
THESE KIDS CAN'T
FOLLOW MULTIPLE REQUESTS

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.000
BECAUSE THEY
GET DISTRACTED.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.660
YOU DON'T TELL THEM
TO DO A,B,C, AND D

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.600
BECAUSE WHILE
THEY'RE DOING A,

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.960
THEY WILL FORGET.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.230
SO YOU GIVE THEM ONE
OR TWO THINGS AT A TIME,

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:33.000
TO MAKE THINGS
MORE HELPFUL.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.560
(NARRATOR)
EVENTUALLY, AS A CHILD
WITH ADHD GETS OLDER,

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.830
THE HYPERACTIVITY AND
IMPULSIVENESS MAY DECREASE.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:43.330
CHILDREN NEED TO LEARN
THROUGH TESTING ON THEIR OWN

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.730
WHAT WORKS AND
WHAT DOESN'T WORK

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:48.600
AND MANY ADULTS END UP
NOT TAKING MEDICATION

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.530
BUT THEY CONTROL
THEIR ENVIRONMENT

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.030
AND THEY DO THINGS

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:54.660
THAT HELP THEM GET BY
WITHOUT MEDICATIONS.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.700
THEY MAY STILL HAVE SOME OF THE
ATTENTION DEFICIT SYMPTOMS--

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.730
THEY MAY NOT BE
AS EXTREME--

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.130
BUT CAN CONTROL
THE ENVIRONMENT MORE.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.800
(NARRATOR)
UNFORTUNATELY, A LOT OF DAMAGE

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.460
MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONE
TO THE CHILD'S SELF-ESTEEM

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.460
BEFORE DIAGNOSIS
AND TREATMENT BEGAN.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.860
HE MAY NEED EXTRA PRAISE
AND ENCOURAGEMENT

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.430
BEFORE HE CAN BEGIN
TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT HIMSELF.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.030
IT'S SIMILAR TO WATERING
THAT PLANT.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:24.700
WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT
THIS PARTICULAR PLANT NEEDS.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:28.360
IS IT JUST WATER
OR IS IT NUTRIENTS?

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.960
IS IT MORE SUNLIGHT
THAT THIS PLANT NEEDS?

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:36.360
WHEN WE'RE ABLE
TO FIGURE THAT OUT

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.960
AND PROVIDE FOR THIS CHILD
WHAT HE NEEDS,

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.960
WE BEGIN
TO SEE GROWTH.
