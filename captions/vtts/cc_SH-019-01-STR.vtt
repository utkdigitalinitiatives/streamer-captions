00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:43.070


2
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.630
Tush! never tell me;

3
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.130
I take it much unkindly

4
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.630
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse

5
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.370
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.

6
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.100
'Sblood, but you will not hear me:

7
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.330
If ever I did dream of such a matter,

8
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.670
Abhor me.

9
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.600
Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.

10
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.300
Despise me, if I do not.

11
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.470
Three great ones of the city,

12
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.570
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,

13
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.000
Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,

14
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.500
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:

15
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.970
But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,

16
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.200
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance

17
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.100
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;

18
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.270
And, in conclusion,

19
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.930
Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,

20
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.130
'I have already chosen my officer.'

21
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.770
And what was he?

22
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.970
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,

23
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.930
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,

24
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.630
A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;

25
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.830
That never set a squadron in the field,

26
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.130
Nor the division of a battle knows

27
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.200
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,

28
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.570
Wherein the toged consuls can propose

29
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.970
As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,

30
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.500
Is all his soldiership.

31
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.400
But he, sir, had the election:

32
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.030
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof

33
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.900
At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds

34
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.470
Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd

35
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.200
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,

36
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.230
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,

37
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.430
And I--God bless the mark!-- his Moorship's ancient.

38
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.630
By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.

39
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.730
Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,

40
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.270
Preferment goes by letter and affection,

41
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.130
And not by old gradation, where each second

42
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.530
Stood heir to the first.

43
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.770
Now, sir, be judge yourself,

44
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.930
Whether I in any just term am affined

45
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.200
To love the Moor.

46
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.100
I would not follow him then.

47
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.770
O, sir, content you;

48
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.200
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:

49
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.630
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters

50
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.500
Cannot be truly follow'd.

51
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.600
You shall mark

52
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.770
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,

53
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.830
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,

54
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.270
Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,

55
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.570
For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:

56
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.500
Whip me such honest knaves.

57
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.030
Others there are

58
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.870
Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,

59
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.900
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,

60
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.170
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,

61
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.230
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats

62
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.600
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;

63
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.830
And such a one do I profess myself.

64
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.000
For, sir, It is as sure as you are Roderigo,

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.530
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:

66
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.530
In following him, I follow but myself;

67
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.570
Heaven is my judge, not for love or duty,

68
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.470
But seeming so, for my peculiar end:

69
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.470
For when my outward action doth demonstrate

70
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.800
The native act and figure of my heart

71
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.130
In compliment extern, 'tis not long after

72
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.270
I shall wear my heart upon my sleeve

73
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.330
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.

74
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.800
What a full fortune does the thicklips owe

75
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.100
If he can carry't thus!

76
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.670
Call up her father,

77
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.800
Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,

78
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.970
Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,

79
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.100
And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,

80
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.270
Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,

81
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.830
Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,

82
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.470
As it may lose some colour.

83
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.970
Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.

84
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.600
Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell

85
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.470
As when, by night and negligence, the fire

86
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.170
Is spied in populous cities.

87
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.730
What, ho, Brabantio!

88
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.530
Signior Brabantio, ho!

89
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.630
Awake!

90
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.070
What, ho, Brabantio!

91
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.630
Thieves!

92
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.830
Thieves!

93
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.730
Thieves!

94
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.900
Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!

95
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.000
Thieves!

96
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.300
Thieves!

97
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.830
What is the reason of this terrible summons?

98
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.270
What is the matter there?

99
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.470
Signior, is all your family within?

100
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.970
Are your doors lock'd?

101
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.030
Why, wherefore ask you this?

102
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.430
'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on your gown;

103
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.400
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;

104
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.070
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram

105
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.270
Is topping your white ewe.

106
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.930
Arise, arise;

107
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.670
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,

108
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.700
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:

109
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.430
Arise, I say.

110
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.330
What, have you lost your wits?

111
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.170
Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?

112
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.730
Not I what are you?

113
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.570
My name is Roderigo.

114
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.400
The worser welcome:

115
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.170
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:

116
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.800
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say

117
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.830
My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,

118
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.530
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,

119
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.870
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come

120
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.970
To start my quiet.

121
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.070
Sir, sir--

122
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.270
But thou must needs be sure

123
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.630
My spirit and my place have in them power

124
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:51.830
To make this bitter to thee.

125
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.930
Patience, good sir.

126
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.400
What tell'st thou me of robbing?

127
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.500
This is Venice;

128
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.230
My house is not a grange.

129
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.970
Most grave Brabantio,

130
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.830
In simple and pure soul I come to you.

131
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.130
'Zounds, sir,

132
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.630
you are one of those that will not serve God,

133
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.200
if the devil bid you.

134
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.700
Because we come to do you service

135
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.770
you think we are ruffians,

136
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.570
you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;

137
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.900
you'll have your nephews neigh to you;

138
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.500
you'll have coursers for cousins

139
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.000
and gennets for germans.

140
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.730
What profane wretch art thou?

141
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.330
I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter

142
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.070
and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.

143
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.230
You art a villain.

144
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.670
You are--

145
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.830
A senator.

146
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.870
This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.

147
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.900
Sir, I will answer any thing.

148
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.300
But, I beseech you,

149
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.700
If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,

150
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.000
As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,

151
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.470
At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,

152
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.830
Transported, with no worse nor better guard

153
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.800
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,

154
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.670
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--

155
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.370
If this be known to you and your allowance,

156
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.500
We then have done you bold and saucy wrong;

157
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.870
But if you know not this, my manners tell me

158
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.000
We have your wrong rebuke.

159
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.970
Do not believe that, from the sense of all civility,

160
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.370
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:

161
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.170
Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,

162
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.370
I say again, hath made a gross revolt;

163
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.470
Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes

164
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.800
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger

165
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.100
Of here and every where.

166
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.730
Straight satisfy yourself:

167
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.670
If she be in her chamber or your house,

168
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.870
Let loose on me the justice of the state

169
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.770
For thus deluding you.

170
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.100
Strike on the tinder, ho!

171
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.730
Farewell; for I must leave you:

172
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.070
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,

173
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.970
To be produced-- as, if I stay, I shall--

174
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.630
Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,

175
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.300
However this may gall him with some cheque,

176
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.200
Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd

177
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.430
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,

178
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.730
Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,

179
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.400
Another of his fathom they have none,

180
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.570
To lead their business: in which regard,

181
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.300
Though I do hate him as I do hells-pains.

182
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.200
Yet, for necessity of present life,

183
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.600
I must show out a flag and sign of love,

184
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.230
Which is indeed but sign.

185
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.170
That you shall surely find him,

186
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.800
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;

187
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.900
And there will I be with him.

188
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.900
So, farewell.

189
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.930
It is too true an evil: gone she is;

190
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.270
And what's to come of my despised time is nought but bitterness.

191
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.470
Now, Roderigo, where didst thou see her?

192
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.730
O unhappy girl!

193
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:33.830
With the Moor, say'st thou?

194
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.470
Who would be a father!

195
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.230
How didst thou know 'twas she?

196
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.530
O thou deceives me past thought!

197
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.670
What said she to you?

198
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:42.100
Get more tapers: Raise all my kindred.

199
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.370
Are they married, think you?

200
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.470
Truly, I think they are.

201
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:45.570
O heaven!

202
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.670
How got she out?

203
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.830
O treason of the blood!

204
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.470
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds

205
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:50.570
By what you see them act.

206
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.770
Is there not charms

207
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.030
By which the property of youth and maidhood

208
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.170
May be abused?

209
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.430
Have you not read, Roderigo,

210
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:56.530
Of some such thing?

211
00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:57.670
Yes, sir, I have indeed.

212
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.130
Call up my brother.

213
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.130
O, that you had had her!

214
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.570
Some one way, some another.

215
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.370
Do you know where we may apprehend her and the Moor?

216
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.170
I think I can discover him, if you please,

217
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.800
To get good guard and go along with me.

218
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.100
Pray you, lead me on.

219
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.230
At every house I'll call; I may command at most.

220
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.400
Get weapons, ho!

221
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.370
And raise some special officers of night.

222
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.600
On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.

223
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.900
Though in the trade of war I have slain men,

224
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.000
Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience

225
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.270
To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity

226
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.430
Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times

227
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.600
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.

228
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.730
'Tis better as it is.

229
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.030
Nay, but he prated,

230
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.130
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms

231
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.230
Against your honour

232
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.670
That, with the little godliness I have,

233
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.430
I did full hard forbear him.

234
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.530
But, I pray you, sir,

235
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.430
Are you fast married?

236
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.700
Be assured of this,

237
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.170
That the magnifico is much beloved,

238
00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.800
And hath in his effect a voice potential

239
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.300
As double as the Duke's: he will divorce you;

240
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.630
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance

241
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.730
The law, with all his might to enforce it on,

242
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.100
Will give him cable.

243
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.600
Let him do his spite:

244
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.400
My services which I have done the signiory

245
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.100
Shall out-tongue his complaints.

246
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.430
'Tis yet to know,--

247
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:21.770
Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,

248
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.630
I shall promulgate-- I fetch my life and being

249
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.730
From men of royal siege, and my demerits

250
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.770
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune

251
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:35.370
As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,

252
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:39.300
But that I love the gentle Desdemona,

253
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.170
I would not my unhoused free condition

254
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.170
Put into circumscription and confine

255
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.170
For the sea's worth.

256
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.770
But, look! What lights come yond?

257
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.500
Those are the raised father and his friends:

258
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.670
You were best go in.

259
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:52.770
Not I I must be found:

260
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.200
My parts, my title and my perfect soul

261
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.600
Shall manifest me rightly.

262
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.700
Is it they?

263
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.630
By Janus, I think no.

264
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.300
The servants of the Duke, and my lieutenant.

265
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.700
The goodness of the night upon you, friends!

266
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.800
What is the news?

267
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.300
The Duke does greet you, general,

268
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.100
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,

269
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.300
Even on the instant.

270
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.430
What is the matter, think you?

271
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.300
Something from Cyprus as I may divine:

272
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.670
It is a business of some heat: the galleys

273
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:16.930
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers

274
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:18.570
This very night at one another's heels,

275
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.730
And many of the consuls, raised and met,

276
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.970
Are at the Duke's already: you have been hotly call'd for;

277
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.030
When, not being at your lodging to be found,

278
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.670
The Senate hath sent about three several quests to search you out.

279
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.900
'Tis well I am found by you.

280
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.130
I will but spend a word here in the house,

281
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.070
And go with you.

282
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.830
Ancient, what makes he here?

283
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.330
Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:

284
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.030
If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.

285
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.330
I do not understand.

286
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.430
He's married.

287
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.600
To who?

288
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.130
Marry, to-- Come, captain, will you go?

289
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.800
Have with you.

290
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.330
Here comes another troop to seek for you.

291
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.670
It is Brabantio.

292
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.100
General, be advised; He comes to bad intent.

293
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.770
Holla! Stand there!

294
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:01.870
Signior, it is the Moor.

295
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.230
Down with him, thief!

296
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.330
You, Roderigo!

297
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.000
Come, sir, I am for you.

298
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.300
Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.

299
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.630
Good signior, you shall more command with years

300
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.200
Than with your weapons.

301
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.670
O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?

302
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.470
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;

303
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.470
For I'll refer me to all things of sense,

304
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.430
If she in chains of magic were not bound,

305
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.430
Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,

306
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.000
So opposite to marriage that she shunned

307
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.470
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,

308
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.200
Could ever have, to incur a general mock,

309
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.130
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom

310
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:49.400
Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.

311
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.400
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense

312
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.470
That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,

313
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.800
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals

314
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.230
That weakens motion: I'll have't disputed on;

315
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.300
'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.

316
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.600
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee

317
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.900
For an abuser of the world, a practiser

318
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.900
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.

319
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.100
Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,

320
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.800
Subdue him at his peril.

321
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.970
Hold your hands,

322
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.870
Both you of my inclining, and the rest:

323
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.670
Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it

324
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.230
Without a prompter.

325
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.770
Where would you go that I would go with you

326
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.870
To answer this your charge?

327
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.700
To prison, till fit time

328
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.500
Of law and course of direct session

329
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.770
Call thee to answer.

330
00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:34.900
What if I do obey?

331
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.770
How may the Duke be therewith satisfied,

332
00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:39.200
Whose messengers are here about my side,

333
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.070
Upon some present business of the state

334
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.170
To bring me to him?

335
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:43.470
'Tis true, most worthy signior;

336
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.670
The Duke's in council and your noble self,

337
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:46.870
I am sure, is sent for.

338
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:47.970
How!

339
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.070
The Duke in council!

340
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.170
This time of the night!

341
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.600
Bring him away:

342
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.400
Mine's not an idle cause: the Duke himself,

343
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.000
Or any of my brothers of the state,

344
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.170
Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;

345
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.570
For if such actions may have passage free,

346
00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.200
Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.

347
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.030
There is no composition in these news

348
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.600
That gives them credit.

349
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.500
Indeed, they are disproportion'd;

350
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.400
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.

351
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.970
And mine, a hundred and forty.

352
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.430
But though they jump not on a just account--

353
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.170
As in these cases, where the aim reports,

354
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.800
'Tis oft with difference-- yet do they all confirm

355
00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.700
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.

356
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.200
Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:

357
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.370
I do not so secure me in the error,

358
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:50.030
But the main article I do approve in fearful sense.

359
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.030
Now, what's the business?

360
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.170
The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,

361
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.600
Steering with due course, towards the isle of Rhodes.

362
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.470
Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.

363
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:03.570
How say you by this change?

364
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.670
This cannot be,

365
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.770
By no assay of reason.

366
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.200
There enjointed them with an after fleet.

367
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.800
Ay, so I thought.

368
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.000
How many, as you guess?

369
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.330
Thirty sail: and now they do restem

370
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.300
Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance

371
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.830
Their purposes toward Cyprus.

372
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:17.970
Signior Montano,

373
00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.930
Your trusty and most valiant servitor,

374
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.770
In his free duty recommends you thus,

375
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.030
And prays you to believe him.

376
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.000
'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.

377
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.600
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.

378
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.070
Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you

379
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.970
Against the general enemy Ottoman.

380
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.570
I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;

381
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.200
We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.

382
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.930
So did I yours.

383
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.570
Good your grace, pardon me;

384
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.200
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business

385
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.570
Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care

386
00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.630
Take hold on me, for my particular grief

387
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.970
Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature

388
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.200
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows

389
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.000
And yet is still itself.

390
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.130
Why, what's the matter?

391
00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.230
My daughter!

392
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.230
O, my daughter!

393
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:02.970
Dead?

394
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.570
Ay, to me;

395
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.630
She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted

396
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.800
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;

397
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.130
For nature so preposterously to err,

398
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.730
Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,

399
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:15.830
Sans witchcraft could not.

400
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.830
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding

401
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.900
Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself

402
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.430
And you of her, the bloody book of law

403
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.200
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter

404
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.500
After your own sense, yea, though our proper son

405
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.730
Stood in your action.

406
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.100
Humbly I thank your grace.

407
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.130
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,

408
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.100
Your special mandate for the state-affairs

409
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.200
Hath hither brought.

410
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.600
We are very sorry for't.

411
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.400
What, in your own part, can you say to this?

412
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.670
Nothing, but this is so.

413
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.930
Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,

414
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:56.600
My very noble and approved good masters,

415
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.730
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,

416
00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.430
It is most true; true, I have married her:

417
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.000
The very head and front of my offending

418
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.030
Hath this extent, no more.

419
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.500
Rude am I in my speech,

420
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.170
And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:

421
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.330
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,

422
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.370
Till now some nine moons wasted,

423
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.630
they have used their dearest action in the tented field,

424
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.470
And little of this great world can I speak,

425
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.700
More than pertains to feats of broils and battle,

426
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.030
And therefore little shall I grace my cause

427
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.200
In speaking for myself.

428
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.370
Yet, by your gracious patience,

429
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:38.230
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver

430
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:44.870
Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,

431
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.130
What conjuration and what mighty magic,

432
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.470
For such proceeding I am charged withal,

433
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.070
I won his daughter.

434
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.730
A maiden never bold;

435
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.800
Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion

436
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.670
Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,

437
00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:01.070
Of years, of country, credit, every thing,

438
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.870
To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!

439
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.330
It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect

440
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.100
That will confess perfection so could err

441
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.100
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven

442
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.070
To find out practises of cunning hell,

443
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.130
Why this should be.

444
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.530
I therefore vouch again

445
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.230
That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,

446
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.800
Or with some dram conjured to this effect,

447
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.070
He wrought upon her.

448
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.230
To vouch this, is no proof,

449
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:24.970
Without more wider and more overt test

450
00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.070
Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods

451
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.230
Of modern seeming do prefer against him.

452
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.370
I do beseech you,

453
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.730
Send for the lady to the Sagittary,

454
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.770
And let her speak of me before her father:

455
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:36.600
If you do find me foul in her report,

456
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.700
The trust, the office I do hold of you,

457
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.100
Not only take away, but let your sentence

458
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.200
Even fall upon my life.

459
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.300
Fetch Desdemona hither.

460
00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.070
Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.

461
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.500
And, till she come, as faithful as to heaven

462
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.570
I do confess the vices of my blood,

463
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.930
So justly to your grave ears I'll present

464
00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:00.300
How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,

465
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.470
And she in mine.

466
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.870
Say it--ah--

467
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:03.870
Othello.

468
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:15.270
Her father loved me; oft invited me;

469
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.030
Still question'd me the story of my life,

470
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.370
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,

471
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:21.830
That I have passed.

472
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:25.500
I ran it through, even from my boyish days,

473
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.270
To the very moment that he bade me tell it;

474
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.930
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,

475
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.870
Of moving accidents by flood and field

476
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.100
Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,

477
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.670
Of being taken by the insolent foe

478
00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:44.470
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence

479
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.800
And portance in my travels' history:

480
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.700
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,

481
00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:58.000
Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven

482
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.930
It was my hint to speak-- such was the process;

483
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.730
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,

484
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:15.500
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads

485
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.270
Do grow beneath their shoulders.

486
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.600
This to hear

487
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.600
Would Desdemona seriously incline:

488
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.670
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:

489
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:31.430
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,

490
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.200
She'd come again, and with a greedy ear

491
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.000
Devour up my discourse: which I observing,

492
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.470
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means

493
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:42.270
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart

494
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.830
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,

495
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.600
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,

496
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.530
But not intentively: I did consent,

497
00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.970
And often did beguile her of her tears,

498
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.330
When I did speak of some distressful stroke

499
00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.730
That my youth suffer'd.

500
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:04.770
My story being done,

501
00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:08.200
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:

502
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:15.030
She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,

503
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.970
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:

504
00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.970
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd

505
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:28.000
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,

506
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.200
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,

507
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:36.570
I should but teach him how to tell my story.

508
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.300
And that would woo her.

509
00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.400
Upon this hint I spake:

510
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.070
She loved me for the dangersI had pass'd,

511
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:47.800
And I loved her that she did pity them.

512
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.670
This only is the witchcraft I have used:

513
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.300
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.

514
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.470
I think this tale would win my daughter too.

515
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:02.630
Good Brabantio,

516
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:04.830
Take up this mangled matter at the best:

517
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.600
Men do their broken weapons rather use

518
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.930
Than their bare hands.

519
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:09.200
I pray you, hear her speak:

520
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.670
If she confess that she was half the wooer,

521
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.970
Destruction on my head, if my bad blame

522
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.630
Light on the man!

523
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:19.030
Come hither, gentle mistress:

524
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.200
Do you perceive in all this noble company

525
00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.870
Where most you owe obedience?

526
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:31.330
My noble father, I do perceive here a divided duty:

527
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:37.000
To you I am bound for life and education;

528
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.370
My life and education both do learn me

529
00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:43.200
How to respect you; you are the lord of all my duty;

530
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.870
I am hitherto your daughter:

531
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:51.270
but here's my husband,

532
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:56.930
And so much duty as my mother show'd to you, preferring you before her father,

533
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.800
So much I challenge that I may profess

534
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.830
Due to the Moor my lord.

535
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:05.970
God be wi'!

536
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.400
I have done.

537
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.300
Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:

538
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.270
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.

539
00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:15.700
Come hither, Moor:

540
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.870
I here do give thee that with all my heart

541
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.400
Which, but thou hast already,

542
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.870
with all my heart I would keep from thee.

543
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.530
For your sake, jewel, I am glad at soul

544
00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:28.770
I have no other child:

545
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.430
For thy escape would teach me tyranny,

546
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.130
To hang clogs on them.

547
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.300
I have done, my lord.

548
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.500
Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,

549
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.230
Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers

550
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:40.400
Into your favour.

551
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.000
When remedies are past, the griefs are ended

552
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.970
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.

553
00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.600
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone

554
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.600
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.

555
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.270
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes

556
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.430
Patience her injury a mockery makes.

557
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:56.700
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;

558
00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.800
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.

559
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.600
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;

560
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.630
We lose it not, so long as we can smile.

561
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:07.130
He bears the sentence well that nothing bears

562
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.100
But the free comfort which from thence he hears,

563
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.130
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow

564
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:16.630
Which, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.

565
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.230
These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,

566
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:23.600
Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:

567
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.730
But words are words; I never yet did hear

568
00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:31.670
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.

569
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.300
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.

570
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.330
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.

571
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.030
Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you;

572
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.000
and though we have there a substitute

573
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.930
of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion,

574
00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.370
a sovereign mistress of effects,

575
00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.670
throws a more safer voice on you:

576
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.030
you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss

577
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.770
of your new fortunes with this more stubborn

578
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.930
and boisterous expedition.

579
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.370
The tyrant custom, most grave senators,

580
00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.670
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war

581
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.930
My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise

582
00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:05.230
A natural and prompt alacrity

583
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.000
I find in hardness, and would undertake

584
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.630
This present wars against the Ottomites.

585
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.570
Most humbly therefore bending to your state,

586
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.030
I crave fit disposition for my wife.

587
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.800
Due reference of place and exhibition,

588
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.630
With such accommodation and besort

589
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:19.830
As levels with her breeding.

590
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.070
If you please,

591
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.300
Be't at her father's.

592
00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.500
I'll not have it so.

593
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.770
Nor I.

594
00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.400
Nor I; I would not there reside,

595
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.000
To put my father in impatient thoughts

596
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.470
By being in his eye.

597
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.170
Most gracious Duke,

598
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.800
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;

599
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.170
And let me find a charter in your voice,

600
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.300
To assist my simpleness.

601
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.770
What would You, Desdemona?

602
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:52.870
That I did love the Moor to live with him,

603
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.100
My downright violence and storm of fortunes

604
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.470
May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued

605
00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.070
Even to the very quality of my lord:

606
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:07.030
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,

607
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.730
And to his honour and his valiant parts

608
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.600
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.

609
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:18.300
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,

610
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.530
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,

611
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:23.470
The rites for why I love him are bereft me,

612
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.630
And I a heavy interim shall support

613
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:27.730
By his dear absence.

614
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.000
Let me go with him.

615
00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.000
Let her have your voice.

616
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.500
Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,

617
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.970
To please the palate of my appetite,

618
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.900
Nor to comply with heat-- the young affects

619
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.930
In me defunct-- and proper satisfaction.

620
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.370
But to be free and bounteous to her mind:

621
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.770
And heaven defend your good souls,

622
00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.930
that you think I will your serious and great business scan

623
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:59.300
For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys

624
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.600
Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness

625
00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.430
My speculative and officed instruments,

626
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:07.370
That my disports corrupt and taint my business,

627
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.730
Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,

628
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.870
And all indign and base adversities

629
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:16.170
Make head against my estimation!

630
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.800
Be it as you shall privately determine, Either for her stay or going:

631
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.400
the affair cries haste and speed must answer it.

632
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.500
You must away to-night.

633
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.600
To-night, my lord?

634
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.700
This night.

635
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:24.930
With all my heart.

636
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:26.170
At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.

637
00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:27.330
Othello, leave some officer behind,

638
00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:28.630
And he shall our commission bring to you;

639
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.370
With such things else of quality and respect

640
00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:31.470
As doth import you.

641
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.670
So please your grace, my ancient;

642
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.570
A man he is of honesty and trust:

643
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:36.470
To his conveyance I assign my wife,

644
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.600
With what else needful your good grace shall think

645
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.730
To be sent after me.

646
00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:40.830
Let it be so.

647
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.830
Good night to every one.

648
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.370
And, noble signior,

649
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.800
If virtue no delightful beauty lack,

650
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.030
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.

651
00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:00.330
Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.

652
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:06.200
Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:

653
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:11.070
She has deceived her father, and may thee.

654
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:14.170
My life upon her faith!

655
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:25.770
Honest Iago, My Desdemona must I leave to thee:

656
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.500
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:

657
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.630
And bring them after in the best advantage.

658
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.300
Come, Desdemona:

659
00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:41.800
I have but an hour

660
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:46.300
Of love, worldly matter and direction,

661
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.400
To spend with thee:

662
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:51.030
we must obey the time.

663
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.400
Iago.

664
00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.430
What say'st thou, noble heart?

665
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.630
What will I do, thinkest thou?

666
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:19.070
Why, go to bed, and sleep.

667
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:22.870
I will incontinently drown myself.

668
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.300
Well, if thou dost, I shall never love thee after it.

669
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.630
Why, thou silly gentleman!

670
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:32.330
It is silliness to live when to live is torment;

671
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:35.630
and then have we a prescription to die

672
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.700
when death is our physician.

673
00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.600
O villainous!

674
00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:45.370
I have looked upon this world four times seven years;

675
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:46.670
and since I could distinguish

676
00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.670
betwixt a benefit and an injury,

677
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:53.500
I never found man that knew how to love himself.

678
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.670
Ere would I say, I would drown myself

679
00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:57.870
for the love of a guinea-hen,

680
00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:00.270
I would change my humanity with a baboon.

681
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.700
What should I do?

682
00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:05.400
I confess it is my shame to be so fond;

683
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.970
but it is not in my virtue to amend it.

684
00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:09.170
Virtue!

685
00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:10.400
A fig!

686
00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.770
'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.

687
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.200
Our bodies are our gardens, to the which

688
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.400
our wills are gardeners:

689
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.000
so that if we will plant nettles, or sow lettuce,

690
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.070
set hyssop and weed up thyme,

691
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.100
supply it with one gender of herbs,

692
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:30.600
or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness,

693
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.770
or manured with industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this

694
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.830
lies in our wills.

695
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:39.670
If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason

696
00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:43.500
to poise another of sensuality,

697
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.170
the blood and baseness of our natures

698
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:49.600
would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions:

699
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.430
but we have reason to cool our raging motions,

700
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:56.100
our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts,

701
00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:00.570
whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion.

702
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:01.700
It cannot be.

703
00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.670
It is merely a lust of the blood

704
00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:07.000
and a permission of the will.

705
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.830
Come, be a man.

706
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.030
Drown thyself!

707
00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:14.930
Drown cats, blind puppies.

708
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:19.100
I have professed me thy friend and I confess me

709
00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:22.730
knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness;

710
00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:26.070
I could never better stead thee than now.

711
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:30.830
Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars;

712
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:33.400
defeat thy favour with an usurped beard;

713
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.330
I say, put money in thy purse.

714
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:37.970
It cannot be long that Desdemona

715
00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.200
shall continue her love unto the Moor--

716
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.600
put money in thy purse-- nor he his to her:

717
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.630
it was a violent commencement in her,

718
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:52.500
and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration--

719
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.470
put but money in thy purse.

720
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.670
These Moors are changeable in their wills:

721
00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:58.830
fill thy purse with money--

722
00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:02.770
the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts,

723
00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:06.770
shall be to him shortly as acerb as coloquintida.

724
00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:10.900
She must change for youth: when she is sated with his body,

725
00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.670
she will find the error of her choice:

726
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:15.430
therefore put money in thy purse.

727
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.200
If thou wilt needs damn thyself,

728
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.970
do it in a more delicate way than drowning.

729
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.300
Make all the money thou canst:

730
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.500
if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian

731
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.800
and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits

732
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:36.500
and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her;

733
00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.800
therefore make money.

734
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.000
A pox on drowning thyself!

735
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.030
It is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be hanged

736
00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:48.800
in compassing thy joy than be drowned and go without her.

737
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.600
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?

738
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.400
Thou art sure of me-- go, make money--

739
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.230
I have told thee often, and I re-tell thee again

740
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.270
and again, I hate the Moor:

741
00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:03.730
my cause is hearted; thine has no less reason.

742
00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:07.670
Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him:

743
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:11.730
if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure,

744
00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.370
and me a sport.

745
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.900
There are many events in the womb of time

746
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.430
which will be delivered.

747
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:17.600
Traverse!

748
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.970
Go, provide thy money.

749
00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:20.130
We'll have more of this to-morrow.

750
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:21.230
Adieu.

751
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:22.630
Where shall we meet i' the morning?

752
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:23.730
At my lodging.

753
00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:25.070
I'll be with thee betimes.

754
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.170
Go to; farewell.

755
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.270
Do you hear, Roderigo?

756
00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.430
What say you?

757
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:30.930
No more of drowning, do you hear?

758
00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:32.100
I am changed.

759
00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.170
Go to, fare well.

760
00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:36.730
Provide thy money.

761
00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:38.700
I'll sell all my land.

762
00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:50.470
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:

763
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:54.400
For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,

764
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.000
If I would time expend with such a snipe.

765
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.200
But for my sport and profit.

766
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.900
I hate the Moor:

767
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:11.400
And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets

768
00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.130
He has done my office: I know not if't be true;

769
00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:17.770
Yet I, for mere suspicion of that kind,

770
00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.270
Will do as if for surety.

771
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:23.300
He holds me well;

772
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:28.030
The better shall my purpose work on him.

773
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:33.930
Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:

774
00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:38.830
To get his place and to plume up my will

775
00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:40.900
In the double knavery--

776
00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:44.600
How, how?

777
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:50.800
Let's see--

778
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.530
After some time, to abuse Othello's ear

779
00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:57.170
That he's too familiar with his wife.

780
00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:01.200
He hath a person and smooth dispose To be suspected,

781
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.970
framed to make women false.

782
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:08.070
The Moor of free and open nature,

783
00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:10.230
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,

784
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:14.030
And will be as tenderly be led by the nose

785
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:15.370
As asses are.

786
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.200
I have't.

787
00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.130
It is engender'd.

788
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.200
Hell and night

789
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.870
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.

790
00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.330
