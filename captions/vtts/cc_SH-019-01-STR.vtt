00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:43.070


2
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.630
Tush! never tell me;

3
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.130
I take it much unkindly

4
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.630
That thou, Iago, who hasthad my purse

5
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.370
As if the strings were thine,shouldst know of this.

6
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.100
'Sblood, but you will nothear me:

7
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.330
If ever I did dream ofsuch a matter,

8
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.670
Abhor me.

9
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.600
Thou told'st me thou didsthold him in thy hate.

10
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.300
Despise me, if I do not.

11
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.470
Three great ones of thecity,

12
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.570
In personal suit to makeme his lieutenant,

13
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.000
Off-capp'd to him: and, bythe faith of man,

14
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.500
I know my price, I amworth no worse a place:

15
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.970
But he; as loving his ownpride and purposes,

16
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.200
Evades them, with abombast circumstance

17
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.100
Horribly stuff'd withepithets of war;

18
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.270
And, in conclusion,

19
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.930
Nonsuits my mediators;for, 'Certes,' says he,

20
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.130
'I have already chosen myofficer.'

21
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.770
And what was he?

22
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.970
Forsooth, a greatarithmetician,

23
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.930
One Michael Cassio, aFlorentine,

24
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.630
A fellow almost damn'd ina fair wife;

25
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.830
That never set a squadronin the field,

26
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.130
Nor the division of abattle knows

27
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.200
More than a spinster;unless the bookish theoric,

28
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.570
Wherein the toged consulscan propose

29
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.970
As masterly as he: mereprattle, without practise,

30
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.500
Is all his soldiership.

31
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.400
But he, sir, had theelection:

32
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.030
And I, of whom his eyeshad seen the proof

33
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.900
At Rhodes, at Cyprus andon other grounds

34
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.470
Christian and heathen, mustbe be-lee'd and calm'd

35
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.200
By debitor and creditor:this counter-caster,

36
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.230
He, in good time, must hislieutenant be,

37
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.430
And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.

38
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.630
By heaven, I rather wouldhave been his hangman.

39
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.730
Why, there's no remedy;'tis the curse of service,

40
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.270
Preferment goes by letterand affection,

41
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.130
And not by old gradation,where each second

42
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.530
Stood heir to the first.

43
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.770
Now, sir, be judgeyourself,

44
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.930
Whether I in any just termam affined

45
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.200
To love the Moor.

46
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.100
I would not follow himthen.

47
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.770
O, sir, content you;

48
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.200
I follow him to serve myturn upon him:

49
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.630
We cannot all be masters,nor all masters

50
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.500
Cannot be truly follow'd.

51
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.600
You shall mark

52
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.770
Many a duteous andknee-crooking knave,

53
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.830
That, doting on his ownobsequious bondage,

54
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.270
Wears out his time, muchlike his master's ass,

55
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.570
For nought but provender, andwhen he's old, cashier'd:

56
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.500
Whip me such honestknaves.

57
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.030
Others there are

58
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.870
Who, trimm'd in forms andvisages of duty,

59
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.900
Keep yet their heartsattending on themselves,

60
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.170
And, throwing but shows ofservice on their lords,

61
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.230
Do well thrive by themand when they have linedtheir coats

62
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.600
Do themselves homage: thesefellows have some soul;

63
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.830
And such a one do Iprofess myself.

64
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.000
For, sir, It is as sure asyou are Roderigo,

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.530
Were I the Moor, I wouldnot be Iago:

66
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.530
In following him, I followbut myself;

67
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.570
Heaven is my judge, notfor love or duty,

68
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.470
But seeming so, for mypeculiar end:

69
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.470
For when my outward actiondoth demonstrate

70
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.800
The native act and figureof my heart

71
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.130
In compliment extern, 'tisnot long after

72
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.270
I shall wear my heart uponmy sleeve

73
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.330
For daws to peck at: I amnot what I am.

74
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.800
What a full fortune doesthe thicklips owe

75
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.100
If he can carry't thus!

76
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.670
Call up her father,

77
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.800
Rouse him: make after him,poison his delight,

78
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.970
Proclaim him in the streets;incense her kinsmen,

79
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.100
And, though he in afertile climate dwell,

80
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.270
Plague him with flies:though that his joy be joy,

81
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.830
Yet throw such changes ofvexation on't,

82
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.470
As it may lose somecolour.

83
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.970
Here is her father'shouse; I'll call aloud.

84
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.600
Do, with like timorousaccent and dire yell

85
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.470
As when, by night andnegligence, the fire

86
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.170
Is spied in populouscities.

87
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.730
What, ho, Brabantio!

88
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.530
Signior Brabantio, ho!

89
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.630
Awake!

90
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.070
What, ho, Brabantio!

91
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.630
Thieves!

92
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.830
Thieves!

93
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.730
Thieves!

94
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.900
Look to your house, yourdaughter and your bags!

95
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.000
Thieves!

96
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.300
Thieves!

97
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.830
What is the reason of thisterrible summons?

98
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.270
What is the matter there?

99
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.470
Signior, is all yourfamily within?

100
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.970
Are your doors lock'd?

101
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.030
Why, wherefore ask youthis?

102
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.430
'Zounds, sir, you'rerobb'd; for shame, put onyour gown;

103
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.400
Your heart is burst, youhave lost half your soul;

104
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.070
Even now, now, very now,an old black ram

105
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.270
Is topping your white ewe.

106
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.930
Arise, arise;

107
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.670
Awake the snortingcitizens with the bell,

108
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.700
Or else the devil willmake a grandsire of you:

109
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.430
Arise, I say.

110
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.330
What, have you lost yourwits?

111
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.170
Most reverend signior, doyou know my voice?

112
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.730
Not I what are you?

113
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.570
My name is Roderigo.

114
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.400
The worser welcome:

115
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.170
I have charged thee not tohaunt about my doors:

116
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.800
In honest plainness thouhast heard me say

117
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.830
My daughter is not forthee; and now, in madness,

118
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.530
Being full of supper anddistempering draughts,

119
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.870
Upon malicious bravery,dost thou come

120
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.970
To start my quiet.

121
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.070
Sir, sir--

122
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.270
But thou must needs besure

123
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.630
My spirit and my placehave in them power

124
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:51.830
To make this bitter tothee.

125
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.930
Patience, good sir.

126
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.400
What tell'st thou me ofrobbing?

127
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.500
This is Venice;

128
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.230
My house is not a grange.

129
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.970
Most grave Brabantio,

130
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.830
In simple and pure soul Icome to you.

131
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.130
'Zounds, sir,

132
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.630
you are one of those thatwill not serve God,

133
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.200
if the devil bid you.

134
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.700
Because we come to do youservice

135
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.770
you think we are ruffians,

136
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.570
you'll have your daughtercovered with a Barbary horse;

137
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.900
you'll have your nephewsneigh to you;

138
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.500
you'll have coursers forcousins

139
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.000
and gennets for germans.

140
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.730
What profane wretch artthou?

141
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.330
I am one, sir, that comesto tell you your daughter

142
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.070
and the Moor are now makingthe beast with two backs.

143
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.230
You art a villain.

144
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.670
You are--

145
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.830
A senator.

146
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.870
This thou shalt answer; Iknow thee, Roderigo.

147
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.900
Sir, I will answer anything.

148
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.300
But, I beseech you,

149
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.700
If't be your pleasure andmost wise consent,

150
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.000
As partly I find it is,that your fair daughter,

151
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.470
At this odd-even and dullwatch o' the night,

152
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.830
Transported, with no worsenor better guard

153
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.800
But with a knave of commonhire, a gondolier,

154
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.670
To the gross clasps of alascivious Moor--

155
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.370
If this be known to youand your allowance,

156
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.500
We then have done you boldand saucy wrong;

157
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.870
But if you know not this,my manners tell me

158
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.000
We have your wrong rebuke.

159
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.970
Do not believe that, fromthe sense of all civility,

160
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.370
I thus would play andtrifle with your reverence:

161
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.170
Your daughter, if you havenot given her leave,

162
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.370
I say again, hath made agross revolt;

163
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.470
Tying her duty, beauty,wit and fortunes

164
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.800
In an extravagant andwheeling stranger

165
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.100
Of here and every where.

166
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.730
Straight satisfy yourself:

167
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.670
If she be in her chamberor your house,

168
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.870
Let loose on me thejustice of the state

169
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.770
For thus deluding you.

170
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.100
Strike on the tinder, ho!

171
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.730
Farewell; for I must leaveyou:

172
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.070
It seems not meet, norwholesome to my place,

173
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.970
To be produced-- as, if Istay, I shall--

174
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.630
Against the Moor: for, Ido know, the state,

175
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.300
However this may gall himwith some cheque,

176
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.200
Cannot with safety casthim, for he's embark'd

177
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.430
With such loud reason tothe Cyprus wars,

178
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.730
Which even now stand inact, that, for their souls,

179
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.400
Another of his fathom theyhave none,

180
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.570
To lead their business: inwhich regard,

181
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.300
Though I do hate him as Ido hells-pains.

182
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.200
Yet, for necessity ofpresent life,

183
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.600
I must show out a flag andsign of love,

184
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.230
Which is indeed but sign.

185
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.170
That you shall surely findhim,

186
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.800
Lead to the Sagittary theraised search;

187
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.900
And there will I be withhim.

188
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.900
So, farewell.

189
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.930
It is too true an evil:gone she is;

190
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.270
And what's to come of mydespised time is noughtbut bitterness.

191
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.470
Now, Roderigo, where didstthou see her?

192
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.730
O unhappy girl!

193
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:33.830
With the Moor, say'stthou?

194
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.470
Who would be a father!

195
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.230
How didst thou know 'twasshe?

196
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.530
O thou deceives me pastthought!

197
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.670
What said she to you?

198
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:42.100
Get more tapers: Raise allmy kindred.

199
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.370
Are they married, thinkyou?

200
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.470
Truly, I think they are.

201
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:45.570
O heaven!

202
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.670
How got she out?

203
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.830
O treason of the blood!

204
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.470
Fathers, from hence trustnot your daughters' minds

205
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:50.570
By what you see them act.

206
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.770
Is there not charms

207
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.030
By which the property ofyouth and maidhood

208
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.170
May be abused?

209
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.430
Have you not read,Roderigo,

210
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:56.530
Of some such thing?

211
00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:57.670
Yes, sir, I have indeed.

212
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.130
Call up my brother.

213
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.130
O, that you had had her!

214
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.570
Some one way, someanother.

215
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.370
Do you know where we mayapprehend her and the Moor?

216
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.170
I think I can discoverhim, if you please,

217
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.800
To get good guard and goalong with me.

218
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.100
Pray you, lead me on.

219
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.230
At every house I'll call;I may command at most.

220
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.400
Get weapons, ho!

221
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.370
And raise some specialofficers of night.

222
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.600
On, good Roderigo: I'lldeserve your pains.

223
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.900
Though in the trade of warI have slain men,

224
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.000
Yet do I hold it verystuff o' the conscience

225
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.270
To do no contrived murder:I lack iniquity

226
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.430
Sometimes to do meservice: nine or ten times

227
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.600
I had thought to have yerk'dhim here under the ribs.

228
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.730
'Tis better as it is.

229
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.030
Nay, but he prated,

230
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.130
And spoke such scurvy andprovoking terms

231
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.230
Against your honour

232
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.670
That, with the littlegodliness I have,

233
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.430
I did full hard forbearhim.

234
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.530
But, I pray you, sir,

235
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.430
Are you fast married?

236
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.700
Be assured of this,

237
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.170
That the magnifico is muchbeloved,

238
00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.800
And hath in his effect avoice potential

239
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.300
As double as the Duke's:he will divorce you;

240
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.630
Or put upon you whatrestraint and grievance

241
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.730
The law, with all hismight to enforce it on,

242
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.100
Will give him cable.

243
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.600
Let him do his spite:

244
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.400
My services which I havedone the signiory

245
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.100
Shall out-tongue hiscomplaints.

246
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.430
'Tis yet to know,--

247
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:21.770
Which, when I know thatboasting is an honour,

248
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.630
I shall promulgate-- Ifetch my life and being

249
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.730
From men of royal siege,and my demerits

250
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.770
May speak unbonneted to asproud a fortune

251
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:35.370
As this that I havereach'd: for know, Iago,

252
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:39.300
But that I love the gentleDesdemona,

253
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.170
I would not my unhousedfree condition

254
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.170
Put into circumscriptionand confine

255
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.170
For the sea's worth.

256
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.770
But, look! What lightscome yond?

257
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.500
Those are the raisedfather and his friends:

258
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.670
You were best go in.

259
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:52.770
Not I I must be found:

260
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.200
My parts, my title and myperfect soul

261
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.600
Shall manifest me rightly.

262
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.700
Is it they?

263
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.630
By Janus, I think no.

264
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.300
The servants of the Duke,and my lieutenant.

265
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.700
The goodness of the nightupon you, friends!

266
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.800
What is the news?

267
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.300
The Duke does greet you,general,

268
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.100
And he requires yourhaste-post-hasteappearance,

269
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.300
Even on the instant.

270
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.430
What is the matter, thinkyou?

271
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.300
Something from Cyprus as Imay divine:

272
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.670
It is a business of someheat: the galleys

273
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:16.930
Have sent a dozen sequentmessengers

274
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:18.570
This very night at oneanother's heels,

275
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.730
And many of the consuls,raised and met,

276
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.970
Are at the Duke's already: youhave been hotly call'd for;

277
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.030
When, not being at yourlodging to be found,

278
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.670
The Senate hath sent aboutthree several quests tosearch you out.

279
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.900
'Tis well I am found byyou.

280
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.130
I will but spend a wordhere in the house,

281
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.070
And go with you.

282
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.830
Ancient, what makes hehere?

283
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.330
Faith, he to-night hathboarded a land carack:

284
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.030
If it prove lawful prize,he's made for ever.

285
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.330
I do not understand.

286
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.430
He's married.

287
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.600
To who?

288
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.130
Marry, to-- Come, captain,will you go?

289
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.800
Have with you.

290
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.330
Here comes another troopto seek for you.

291
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.670
It is Brabantio.

292
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.100
General, be advised; Hecomes to bad intent.

293
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.770
Holla! Stand there!

294
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:01.870
Signior, it is the Moor.

295
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.230
Down with him, thief!

296
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.330
You, Roderigo!

297
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.000
Come, sir, I am for you.

298
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.300
Keep up your brightswords, for the dew willrust them.

299
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.630
Good signior, you shallmore command with years

300
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.200
Than with your weapons.

301
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.670
O thou foul thief, wherehast thou stow'd mydaughter?

302
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.470
Damn'd as thou art, thouhast enchanted her;

303
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.470
For I'll refer me to allthings of sense,

304
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.430
If she in chains of magicwere not bound,

305
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.430
Whether a maid so tender,fair and happy,

306
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.000
So opposite to marriagethat she shunned

307
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.470
The wealthy curleddarlings of our nation,

308
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.200
Could ever have, to incura general mock,

309
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.130
Run from her guardage tothe sooty bosom

310
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:49.400
Of such a thing as thou,to fear, not to delight.

311
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.400
Judge me the world, if'tis not gross in sense

312
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.470
That thou hast practisedon her with foul charms,

313
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.800
Abused her delicate youthwith drugs or minerals

314
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.230
That weakens motion: I'llhave't disputed on;

315
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.300
'Tis probable and palpableto thinking.

316
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.600
I therefore apprehend anddo attach thee

317
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.900
For an abuser of theworld, a practiser

318
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.900
Of arts inhibited and outof warrant.

319
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.100
Lay hold upon him: if hedo resist,

320
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.800
Subdue him at his peril.

321
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.970
Hold your hands,

322
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.870
Both you of my inclining,and the rest:

323
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.670
Were it my cue to fight, Ishould have known it

324
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.230
Without a prompter.

325
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.770
Where would you go that Iwould go with you

326
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.870
To answer this yourcharge?

327
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.700
To prison, till fit time

328
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.500
Of law and course ofdirect session

329
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.770
Call thee to answer.

330
00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:34.900
What if I do obey?

331
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.770
How may the Duke betherewith satisfied,

332
00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:39.200
Whose messengers are hereabout my side,

333
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.070
Upon some present businessof the state

334
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.170
To bring me to him?

335
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:43.470
'Tis true, most worthysignior;

336
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.670
The Duke's in council andyour noble self,

337
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:46.870
I am sure, is sent for.

338
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:47.970
How!

339
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.070
The Duke in council!

340
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.170
This time of the night!

341
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.600
Bring him away:

342
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.400
Mine's not an idle cause:the Duke himself,

343
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.000
Or any of my brothers ofthe state,

344
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.170
Cannot but feel this wrongas 'twere their own;

345
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.570
For if such actions mayhave passage free,

346
00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.200
Bond-slaves and pagansshall our statesmen be.

347
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.030
There is no composition inthese news

348
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.600
That gives them credit.

349
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.500
Indeed, they aredisproportion'd;

350
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.400
My letters say a hundredand seven galleys.

351
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.970
And mine, a hundred andforty.

352
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.430
But though they jump noton a just account--

353
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.170
As in these cases, wherethe aim reports,

354
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.800
'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm

355
00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.700
A Turkish fleet, andbearing up to Cyprus.

356
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.200
Nay, it is possible enoughto judgment:

357
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.370
I do not so secure me inthe error,

358
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:50.030
But the main article I doapprove in fearful sense.

359
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.030
Now, what's the business?

360
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.170
The Ottomites, reverendand gracious,

361
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.600
Steering with due course,towards the isle of Rhodes.

362
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.470
Nay, in all confidence,he's not for Rhodes.

363
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:03.570
How say you by thischange?

364
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.670
This cannot be,

365
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.770
By no assay of reason.

366
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.200
There enjointed them withan after fleet.

367
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.800
Ay, so I thought.

368
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.000
How many, as you guess?

369
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.330
Thirty sail: and now theydo restem

370
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.300
Their backward course,bearing with frankappearance

371
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.830
Their purposes towardCyprus.

372
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:17.970
Signior Montano,

373
00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.930
Your trusty and mostvaliant servitor,

374
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.770
In his free dutyrecommends you thus,

375
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.030
And prays you to believehim.

376
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.000
'Tis certain, then, forCyprus.

377
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.600
Here comes Brabantio andthe valiant Moor.

378
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.070
Valiant Othello, we muststraight employ you

379
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.970
Against the general enemyOttoman.

380
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.570
I did not see you;welcome, gentle signior;

381
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.200
We lack'd your counsel andyour help tonight.

382
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.930
So did I yours.

383
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.570
Good your grace, pardonme;

384
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.200
Neither my place nor aughtI heard of business

385
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.570
Hath raised me from my bed,nor doth the general care

386
00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.630
Take hold on me, for myparticular grief

387
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.970
Is of so flood-gate ando'erbearing nature

388
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.200
That it engluts andswallows other sorrows

389
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.000
And yet is still itself.

390
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.130
Why, what's the matter?

391
00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.230
My daughter!

392
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.230
O, my daughter!

393
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:02.970
Dead?

394
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.570
Ay, to me;

395
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.630
She is abused, stol'n fromme, and corrupted

396
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.800
By spells and medicinesbought of mountebanks;

397
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.130
For nature sopreposterously to err,

398
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.730
Being not deficient,blind, or lame of sense,

399
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:15.830
Sans witchcraft could not.

400
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.830
Whoe'er he be that in thisfoul proceeding

401
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.900
Hath thus beguiled yourdaughter of herself

402
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.430
And you of her, the bloodybook of law

403
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.200
You shall yourself read inthe bitter letter

404
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.500
After your own sense, yea,though our proper son

405
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.730
Stood in your action.

406
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.100
Humbly I thank your grace.

407
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.130
Here is the man, thisMoor, whom now, it seems,

408
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.100
Your special mandate forthe state-affairs

409
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.200
Hath hither brought.

410
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.600
We are very sorry for't.

411
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.400
What, in your own part,can you say to this?

412
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.670
Nothing, but this is so.

413
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.930
Most potent, grave, andreverend signiors,

414
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:56.600
My very noble and approvedgood masters,

415
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.730
That I have ta'en awaythis old man's daughter,

416
00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.430
It is most true; true, Ihave married her:

417
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.000
The very head and front ofmy offending

418
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.030
Hath this extent, no more.

419
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.500
Rude am I in my speech,

420
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.170
And little bless'd withthe soft phrase of peace:

421
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.330
For since these arms ofmine had seven years' pith,

422
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.370
Till now some nine moonswasted,

423
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.630
they have used theirdearest action in thetented field,

424
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.470
And little of this greatworld can I speak,

425
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.700
More than pertains to featsof broils and battle,

426
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.030
And therefore little shallI grace my cause

427
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.200
In speaking for myself.

428
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.370
Yet, by your graciouspatience,

429
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:38.230
I will a round unvarnish'dtale deliver

430
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:44.870
Of my whole course of love;what drugs, what charms,

431
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.130
What conjuration and whatmighty magic,

432
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.470
For such proceeding I amcharged withal,

433
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.070
I won his daughter.

434
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.730
A maiden never bold;

435
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.800
Of spirit so still andquiet, that her motion

436
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.670
Blush'd at herself; andshe, in spite of nature,

437
00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:01.070
Of years, of country,credit, every thing,

438
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.870
To fall in love with whatshe fear'd to look on!

439
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.330
It is a judgment maim'dand most imperfect

440
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.100
That will confessperfection so could err

441
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.100
Against all rules ofnature, and must be driven

442
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.070
To find out practises ofcunning hell,

443
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.130
Why this should be.

444
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.530
I therefore vouch again

445
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.230
That with some mixturespowerful o'er the blood,

446
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.800
Or with some dram conjuredto this effect,

447
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.070
He wrought upon her.

448
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.230
To vouch this, is noproof,

449
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:24.970
Without more wider andmore overt test

450
00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.070
Than these thin habits andpoor likelihoods

451
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.230
Of modern seeming doprefer against him.

452
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.370
I do beseech you,

453
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.730
Send for the lady to theSagittary,

454
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.770
And let her speak of mebefore her father:

455
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:36.600
If you do find me foul inher report,

456
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.700
The trust, the office I dohold of you,

457
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.100
Not only take away, butlet your sentence

458
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.200
Even fall upon my life.

459
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.300
Fetch Desdemona hither.

460
00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.070
Ancient, conduct them: youbest know the place.

461
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.500
And, till she come, asfaithful as to heaven

462
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.570
I do confess the vices ofmy blood,

463
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.930
So justly to your graveears I'll present

464
00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:00.300
How I did thrive in thisfair lady's love,

465
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.470
And she in mine.

466
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.870
Say it--ah--

467
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:03.870
Othello.

468
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:15.270
Her father loved me; oftinvited me;

469
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.030
Still question'd me thestory of my life,

470
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.370
From year to year, thebattles, sieges, fortunes,

471
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:21.830
That I have passed.

472
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:25.500
I ran it through, evenfrom my boyish days,

473
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.270
To the very moment that hebade me tell it;

474
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.930
Wherein I spake of mostdisastrous chances,

475
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.870
Of moving accidents byflood and field

476
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.100
Of hair-breadth scapes i'the imminent deadlybreach,

477
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.670
Of being taken by theinsolent foe

478
00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:44.470
And sold to slavery, of myredemption thence

479
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.800
And portance in mytravels' history:

480
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.700
Wherein of antres vast anddeserts idle,

481
00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:58.000
Rough quarries, rocks andhills whose heads touch heaven

482
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.930
It was my hint to speak--such was the process;

483
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.730
And of the Cannibals thateach other eat,

484
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:15.500
The Anthropophagi and menwhose heads

485
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.270
Do grow beneath theirshoulders.

486
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.600
This to hear

487
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.600
Would Desdemona seriouslyincline:

488
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.670
But still thehouse-affairs would drawher thence:

489
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:31.430
Which ever as she couldwith haste dispatch,

490
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.200
She'd come again, and witha greedy ear

491
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.000
Devour up my discourse:which I observing,

492
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.470
Took once a pliant hour,and found good means

493
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:42.270
To draw from her a prayerof earnest heart

494
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.830
That I would all mypilgrimage dilate,

495
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.600
Whereof by parcels she hadsomething heard,

496
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.530
But not intentively: I didconsent,

497
00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.970
And often did beguile herof her tears,

498
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.330
When I did speak of somedistressful stroke

499
00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.730
That my youth suffer'd.

500
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:04.770
My story being done,

501
00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:08.200
She gave me for my pains aworld of sighs:

502
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:15.030
She swore, in faith, twasstrange, 'twas passingstrange,

503
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.970
'Twas pitiful, 'twaswondrous pitiful:

504
00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.970
She wish'd she had notheard it, yet she wish'd

505
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:28.000
That heaven had made hersuch a man: she thank'd me,

506
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.200
And bade me, if I had afriend that loved her,

507
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:36.570
I should but teach him howto tell my story.

508
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.300
And that would woo her.

509
00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.400
Upon this hint I spake:

510
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.070
She loved me for thedangersI had pass'd,

511
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:47.800
And I loved her that shedid pity them.

512
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.670
This only is thewitchcraft I have used:

513
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.300
Here comes the lady; lether witness it.

514
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.470
I think this tale wouldwin my daughter too.

515
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:02.630
Good Brabantio,

516
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:04.830
Take up this mangledmatter at the best:

517
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.600
Men do their brokenweapons rather use

518
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.930
Than their bare hands.

519
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:09.200
I pray you, hear herspeak:

520
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.670
If she confess that shewas half the wooer,

521
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.970
Destruction on my head, ifmy bad blame

522
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.630
Light on the man!

523
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:19.030
Come hither, gentlemistress:

524
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.200
Do you perceive in allthis noble company

525
00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.870
Where most you oweobedience?

526
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:31.330
My noble father, I doperceive here a divided duty:

527
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:37.000
To you I am bound for lifeand education;

528
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.370
My life and education bothdo learn me

529
00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:43.200
How to respect you; you arethe lord of all my duty;

530
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.870
I am hitherto yourdaughter:

531
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:51.270
but here's my husband,

532
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:56.930
And so much duty as my mothershow'd to you, preferring youbefore her father,

533
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.800
So much I challenge that Imay profess

534
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.830
Due to the Moor my lord.

535
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:05.970
God be wi'!

536
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.400
I have done.

537
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.300
Please it your grace, onto the state-affairs:

538
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.270
I had rather to adopt achild than get it.

539
00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:15.700
Come hither, Moor:

540
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.870
I here do give thee thatwith all my heart

541
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.400
Which, but thou hastalready,

542
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.870
with all my heart I wouldkeep from thee.

543
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.530
For your sake, jewel, I amglad at soul

544
00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:28.770
I have no other child:

545
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.430
For thy escape would teachme tyranny,

546
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.130
To hang clogs on them.

547
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.300
I have done, my lord.

548
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.500
Let me speak like yourself,and lay a sentence,

549
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.230
Which, as a grise or step,may help these lovers

550
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:40.400
Into your favour.

551
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.000
When remedies are past,the griefs are ended

552
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.970
By seeing the worst, whichlate on hopes depended.

553
00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.600
To mourn a mischief thatis past and gone

554
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.600
Is the next way to drawnew mischief on.

555
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.270
What cannot be preservedwhen fortune takes

556
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.430
Patience her injury amockery makes.

557
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:56.700
The robb'd that smiles stealssomething from the thief;

558
00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.800
He robs himself thatspends a bootless grief.

559
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.600
So let the Turk of Cyprusus beguile;

560
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.630
We lose it not, so long aswe can smile.

561
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:07.130
He bears the sentence wellthat nothing bears

562
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.100
But the free comfort whichfrom thence he hears,

563
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.130
But he bears both thesentence and the sorrow

564
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:16.630
Which, to pay grief, mustof poor patience borrow.

565
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.230
These sentences, to sugar,or to gall,

566
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:23.600
Being strong on bothsides, are equivocal:

567
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.730
But words are words; Inever yet did hear

568
00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:31.670
That the bruised heart waspierced through the ear.

569
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.300
I humbly beseech you, proceedto the affairs of state.

570
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.330
The Turk with a mostmighty preparation makesfor Cyprus.

571
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.030
Othello, the fortitude of theplace is best known to you;

572
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.000
and though we have there asubstitute

573
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.930
of most allowedsufficiency, yet opinion,

574
00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.370
a sovereign mistress ofeffects,

575
00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.670
throws a more safer voiceon you:

576
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.030
you must therefore becontent to slubber the gloss

577
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.770
of your new fortunes withthis more stubborn

578
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.930
and boisterous expedition.

579
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.370
The tyrant custom, mostgrave senators,

580
00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.670
Hath made the flinty andsteel couch of war

581
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.930
My thrice-driven bed ofdown: I do agnise

582
00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:05.230
A natural and promptalacrity

583
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.000
I find in hardness, andwould undertake

584
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.630
This present wars againstthe Ottomites.

585
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.570
Most humbly thereforebending to your state,

586
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.030
I crave fit dispositionfor my wife.

587
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.800
Due reference of place andexhibition,

588
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.630
With such accommodationand besort

589
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:19.830
As levels with herbreeding.

590
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.070
If you please,

591
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.300
Be't at her father's.

592
00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.500
I'll not have it so.

593
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.770
Nor I.

594
00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.400
Nor I; I would not therereside,

595
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.000
To put my father inimpatient thoughts

596
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.470
By being in his eye.

597
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.170
Most gracious Duke,

598
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.800
To my unfolding lend yourprosperous ear;

599
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.170
And let me find a charterin your voice,

600
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.300
To assist my simpleness.

601
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.770
What would You, Desdemona?

602
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:52.870
That I did love the Moorto live with him,

603
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.100
My downright violence andstorm of fortunes

604
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.470
May trumpet to the world:my heart's subdued

605
00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.070
Even to the very qualityof my lord:

606
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:07.030
I saw Othello's visage inhis mind,

607
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.730
And to his honour and hisvaliant parts

608
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.600
Did I my soul and fortunesconsecrate.

609
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:18.300
So that, dear lords, if Ibe left behind,

610
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.530
A moth of peace, and he goto the war,

611
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:23.470
The rites for why I lovehim are bereft me,

612
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.630
And I a heavy interimshall support

613
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:27.730
By his dear absence.

614
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.000
Let me go with him.

615
00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.000
Let her have your voice.

616
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.500
Vouch with me, heaven, Itherefore beg it not,

617
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.970
To please the palate of myappetite,

618
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.900
Nor to comply with heat--the young affects

619
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.930
In me defunct-- and propersatisfaction.

620
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.370
But to be free andbounteous to her mind:

621
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.770
And heaven defend yourgood souls,

622
00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.930
that you think I will yourserious and great business scan

623
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:59.300
For she is with me: no,when light-wing'd toys

624
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.600
Of feather'd Cupid sealwith wanton dullness

625
00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.430
My speculative and officedinstruments,

626
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:07.370
That my disports corruptand taint my business,

627
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.730
Let housewives make askillet of my helm,

628
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.870
And all indign and baseadversities

629
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:16.170
Make head against myestimation!

630
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.800
Be it as you shallprivately determine, Eitherfor her stay or going:

631
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.400
the affair cries haste andspeed must answer it.

632
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.500
You must away to-night.

633
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.600
To-night, my lord?

634
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.700
This night.

635
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:24.930
With all my heart.

636
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:26.170
At nine i' the morninghere we'll meet again.

637
00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:27.330
Othello, leave someofficer behind,

638
00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:28.630
And he shall ourcommission bring to you;

639
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.370
With such things else ofquality and respect

640
00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:31.470
As doth import you.

641
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.670
So please your grace, myancient;

642
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.570
A man he is of honesty andtrust:

To his conveyance I assignmy wife,

644
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.600
With what else needful yourgood grace shall think

645
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.730
To be sent after me.

646
00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:40.830
Let it be so.

647
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.830
Good night to every one.

648
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.370
And, noble signior,

649
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.800
If virtue no delightfulbeauty lack,

650
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.030
Your son-in-law is farmore fair than black.

651
00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:00.330
Adieu, brave Moor, useDesdemona well.

652
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:06.200
Look to her, Moor, if thouhast eyes to see:

653
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:11.070
She has deceived herfather, and may thee.

654
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:14.170
My life upon her faith!

655
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:25.770
Honest Iago, My Desdemonamust I leave to thee:

656
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.500
I prithee, let thy wifeattend on her:

657
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.630
And bring them after inthe best advantage.

658
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.300
Come, Desdemona:

659
00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:41.800
I have but an hour

660
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:46.300
Of love, worldly matterand direction,

661
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.400
To spend with thee:

662
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:51.030
we must obey the time.

663
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.400
Iago.

664
00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.430
What say'st thou, nobleheart?

665
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.630
What will I do, thinkestthou?

666
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:19.070
Why, go to bed, and sleep.

667
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:22.870
I will incontinently drownmyself.

668
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.300
Well, if thou dost, Ishall never love theeafter it.

669
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.630
Why, thou silly gentleman!

670
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:32.330
It is silliness to livewhen to live is torment;

671
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:35.630
and then have we aprescription to die

672
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.700
when death is ourphysician.

673
00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.600
O villainous!

674
00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:45.370
I have looked upon this worldfour times seven years;

675
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:46.670
and since I coulddistinguish

676
00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.670
betwixt a benefit and aninjury,

677
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:53.500
I never found man thatknew how to love himself.

678
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.670
Ere would I say, I woulddrown myself

679
00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:57.870
for the love of aguinea-hen,

680
00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:00.270
I would change my humanitywith a baboon.

681
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.700
What should I do?

682
00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:05.400
I confess it is my shameto be so fond;

683
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.970
but it is not in my virtueto amend it.

684
00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:09.170
Virtue!

685
00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:10.400
A fig!

686
00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.770
'Tis in ourselves that weare thus or thus.

687
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.200
Our bodies are ourgardens, to the which

688
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.400
our wills are gardeners:

689
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.000
so that if we will plantnettles, or sow lettuce,

690
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.070
set hyssop and weed upthyme,

691
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.100
supply it with one genderof herbs,

692
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:30.600
or distract it with many,either to have it sterilewith idleness,

693
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.770
or manured with industry,why, the power and corrigibleauthority of this

694
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.830
lies in our wills.

695
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:39.670
If the balance of ourlives had not one scale ofreason

696
00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:43.500
to poise another ofsensuality,

697
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.170
the blood and baseness ofour natures

698
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:49.600
would conduct us to mostpreposterous conclusions:

699
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.430
but we have reason to coolour raging motions,

700
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:56.100
our carnal stings, ourunbitted lusts,

701
00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:00.570
whereof I take this thatyou call love to be a sector scion.

702
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:01.700
It cannot be.

703
00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.670
It is merely a lust of theblood

704
00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:07.000
and a permission of thewill.

705
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.830
Come, be a man.

706
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.030
Drown thyself!

707
00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:14.930
Drown cats, blind puppies.

708
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:19.100
I have professed me thyfriend and I confess me

709
00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:22.730
knit to thy deserving withcables of perdurabletoughness;

710
00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:26.070
I could never better steadthee than now.

711
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:30.830
Put money in thy purse;follow thou the wars;

712
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:33.400
defeat thy favour with anusurped beard;

713
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.330
I say, put money in thypurse.

714
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:37.970
It cannot be long thatDesdemona

715
00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.200
shall continue her loveunto the Moor--

716
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.600
put money in thy purse--nor he his to her:

717
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.630
it was a violentcommencement in her,

718
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:52.500
and thou shalt see ananswerable sequestration--

719
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.470
put but money in thypurse.

720
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.670
These Moors are changeablein their wills:

721
00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:58.830
fill thy purse withmoney--

722
00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:02.770
the food that to him nowis as luscious as locusts,

723
00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:06.770
shall be to him shortly asacerb as coloquintida.

724
00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:10.900
She must change foryouth: when she is satedwith his body,

725
00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.670
she will find the error ofher choice:

726
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:15.430
therefore put money in thypurse.

727
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.200
If thou wilt needs damnthyself,

728
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.970
do it in a more delicateway than drowning.

729
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.300
Make all the money thoucanst:

730
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.500
if sanctimony and a frailvow betwixt an erringbarbarian

731
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.800
and a supersubtle Venetianbe not too hard for my wits

732
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:36.500
and all the tribe of hell,thou shalt enjoy her;

733
00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.800
therefore make money.

734
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.000
A pox on drowning thyself!

735
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.030
It is clean out of theway: seek thou rather tobe hanged

736
00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:48.800
in compassing thy joy than bedrowned and go without her.

737
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.600
Wilt thou be fast to myhopes, if I depend on theissue?

738
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.400
Thou art sure of me-- go,make money--

739
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.230
I have told thee often,and I re-tell thee again

740
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.270
and again, I hate theMoor:

741
00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:03.730
my cause is hearted; thinehas no less reason.

742
00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:07.670
Let us be conjunctive inour revenge against him:

743
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:11.730
if thou canst cuckold him,thou dost thyself apleasure,

744
00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.370
and me a sport.

745
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.900
There are many events inthe womb of time

746
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.430
which will be delivered.

747
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:17.600
Traverse!

748
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.970
Go, provide thy money.

749
00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:20.130
We'll have more of thisto-morrow.

750
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:21.230
Adieu.

751
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:22.630
Where shall we meet i' themorning?

752
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:23.730
At my lodging.

753
00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:25.070
I'll be with thee betimes.

754
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.170
Go to; farewell.

755
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.270
Do you hear, Roderigo?

756
00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.430
What say you?

757
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:30.930
No more of drowning, doyou hear?

758
00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:32.100
I am changed.

759
00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.170
Go to, fare well.

760
00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:36.730
Provide thy money.

761
00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:38.700
I'll sell all my land.

762
00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:50.470
Thus do I ever make myfool my purse:

763
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:54.400
For I mine own gain'dknowledge should profane,

764
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.000
If I would time expendwith such a snipe.

765
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.200
But for my sport andprofit.

766
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.900
I hate the Moor:

767
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:11.400
And it is thought abroad,that 'twixt my sheets

768
00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.130
He has done my office: Iknow not if't be true;

769
00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:17.770
Yet I, for mere suspicionof that kind,

770
00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.270
Will do as if for surety.

771
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:23.300
He holds me well;

772
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:28.030
The better shall mypurpose work on him.

773
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:33.930
Cassio's a proper man: letme see now:

774
00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:38.830
To get his place and toplume up my will

775
00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:40.900
In the double knavery--

776
00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:44.600
How, how?

777
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:50.800
Let's see--

778
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.530
After some time, to abuseOthello's ear

779
00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:57.170
That he's too familiarwith his wife.

780
00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:01.200
He hath a person andsmooth dispose To besuspected,

781
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.970
framed to make womenfalse.

782
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:08.070
The Moor of free and opennature,

783
00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:10.230
That thinks men honestthat but seem to be so,

784
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:14.030
And will be as tenderly beled by the nose

785
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:15.370
As asses are.

786
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.200
I have't.

787
00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.130
It is engender'd.

788
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.200
Hell and night

789
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.870
Must bring this monstrousbirth to the world's light.

790
00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.330
