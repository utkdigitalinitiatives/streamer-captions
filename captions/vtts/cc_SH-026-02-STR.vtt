00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.600

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:28.600


3
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.300
HOW GOES THE NIGHT, BOY?

4
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.170
THE MOON IS DOWN. I HAVE NOT HEARD THE CLOCK.

5
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.900
AND SHE GOES DOWN AT 12:00.

6
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.230
I TAKE'T, 'TIS LATER, SIR.

7
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.230
HOLD.

8
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.030
TAKE MY SWORD.

9
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.730
THERE'S HUSBANDRY IN HEAVEN.

10
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.700
THEIR CANDLES ARE ALL OUT.

11
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.870
TAKE THEE THAT TOO.

12
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.700
A HEAVY SUMMONS LIES LIKE LEAD UPON ME,

13
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.400
AND YET I WOULD NOT SLEEP.

14
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.370
MERCIFUL POWERS, RESTRAIN IN ME THE CURSED THOUGHTS

15
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.200
THAT NATURE GIVES WAY TO IN REPOSE.

16
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.430
[faint banging noise]

17
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.270
GIVE ME MY SWORD.

18
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.670
WHO'S THERE?

19
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.170
[laughing]

20
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.230
A FRIEND.

21
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.070
WHAT, SIR, NOT YET AT REST?

22
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.530
THE KING'S ABED.

23
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.100
HE HATH BEEN IN UNUSUAL PLEASURE,

24
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.300
AND SENT FORTH GREAT LARGESS TO YOUR OFFICES.

25
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.400
THIS DIAMOND HE GREETS YOUR WIFE WITHAL,

26
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.130
BY THE NAME OF MOST KIND HOSTESS,

27
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.430
AND SHUT UP IN MEASURELESS CONTENT.

28
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.900
BEING UNPREPARED,

29
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.830
OUR WILL BECAME THE SERVANT TO DEFECT,

30
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.200
WHICH ELSE SHOULD FREE HAVE WROUGHT.

31
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.030
ALL'S WELL.

32
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.970
I DREAMT LAST NIGHT OF THE THREE WEIRD SISTERS.

33
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.830
TO YOU THEY HAVE SHOWED SOME TRUTH.

34
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.300
I THINK NOT OF THEM.

35
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.630
YET WHEN WE CAN ENTREAT AN HOUR TO SERVE,

36
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.670
WE WOULD SPEND IT

37
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.970
IN SOME WORDS UPON THAT BUSINESS,

38
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.130
IF YOU WOULD GRANT THE TIME.

39
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.700
AT YOUR KIND'ST LEISURE.

40
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.330
IF YOU SHALL CLEAVE TO MY CONSENT,

41
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.770
WHEN 'TIS, IT SHALL MAKE HONOR FOR YOU.

42
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.970
SO I LOSE NONE IN SEEKING TO AUGMENT IT,

43
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.230
BUT STILL KEEP MY BOSOM FRANCHISED

44
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.330
AND ALLEGIANCE CLEAR,

45
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.000
I SHALL BE COUNSELED.

46
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.130
GOOD REPOSE THE WHILE.

47
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.370
THANKS, SIR. THE LIKE TO YOU.

48
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.630
GO BID THY MISTRESS, WHEN MY DRINK IS READY,

49
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.030
SHE STRIKE UPON THE BELL.

50
00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.600
GET THEE TO BED.

51
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.670
[thunder rumbling]

52
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:33.330


53
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.770
IS THIS A DAGGER WHICH I SEE BEFORE ME,

54
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.630
THE HANDLE TOWARD MY HAND?

55
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.030
COME,

56
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.570
LET ME CLUTCH THEE.

57
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.600
I HAVE THEE NOT,

58
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.300
AND YET I SEE THEE STILL.

59
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.970
ART THOU NOT, FATAL VISION, SENSIBLE TO FEELING AS TO SIGHT?

60
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.870
OR ART THOU BUT A DAGGER OF THE MIND,

61
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.230
A FALSE CREATION PROCEEDING FROM THE HEAT-OPPRESSED BRAIN?

62
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.100
I SEE THEE YET,

63
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.200
IN FORM AS PALPABLE AS THIS WHICH NOW I DRAW.

64
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.700
THOU MARSHAL'ST ME THE WAY THAT I WAS GOING,

65
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.530
AND SUCH AN INSTRUMENT I WAS TO USE.

66
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.300
MINE EYES ARE MADE THE FOOLS O' THE OTHER SENSES,

67
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.070
OR ELSE...

68
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.570
WORTH ALL THE REST.

69
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.070
I SEE THEE STILL,

70
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.030
AND ON MY BLADE AND DUDGEON GOUTS OF BLOOD,

71
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.900
WHICH WAS NOT SO BEFORE.

72
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.900
[gasps]

73
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.670
THERE'S NO SUCH THING.

74
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.770
IT IS THE BLOODY BUSINESS WHICH INFORMS THUS TO MINE EYES.

75
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:26.100
NOW O'ER THE ONE HALF WORLD NATURE SEEMS DEAD,

76
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.330
AND WICKED DREAMS ABUSE THE CURTAINED SLEEP.

77
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.170
WITCHCRAFT CELEBRATES PALE HECAT'S OFFERINGS,

78
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.370
AND WITHERED MURDER, ALARUMED BY HIS SENTINEL, THE WOLF,

79
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.430
WHOSE HOWL'S HIS WATCH,

80
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:49.300
THUS WITH THIS STEALTHY PACE, WITH TARQUIN'S RAVISHING STRIDE,

81
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.770
TOWARD HIS DESIGN MOVES LIKE A GHOST.

82
00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.030
THOU SURE AND FIRM-SET EARTH, HEAR NOT MY STEPS,

83
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.770
WHICH WAY THEY WALK,

84
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.800
FOR FEAR THE VERY STONES PRATE OF MY WHEREABOUT;

85
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.270
AND TAKE THE PRESENT HORROR FROM THE TIME,

86
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.100
WHICH NOW SUITS WITH IT.

87
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.970
WHILES I THREAT, HE LIVES.

88
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.970
[bell rings]

89
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.800
I GO, AND IT IS DONE.

90
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.770
THE BELL INVITES ME.

91
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.770
HEAR IT NOT, DUNCAN,

92
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:42.930
FOR IT IS A KNELL THAT SUMMONS THEE TO HEAVEN...

93
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.270
OR TO HELL.

94
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:24.500


95
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.470
[breathing heavily]

96
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:32.770
THAT WHICH HATH MADE THEM DRUNK HATH MADE ME BOLD.

97
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.600
WHAT HATH QUENCHED THEM HATH GIVEN ME FIRE.

98
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.530
[bird screeches]

99
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.530
HARK!

100
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.770
[gasping]

101
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.030
PEACE.

102
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:51.270
IT WAS THE OWL THAT SHRIEKED, THE FATAL BELLMAN,

103
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.100
WHICH GIVES THE STERN'ST GOOD NIGHT.

104
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.930
HE IS ABOUT IT.

105
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.570
THE DOORS ARE OPEN,

106
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:11.230
MOCK THEIR CHARGE WITH SNORES.

107
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.630
I HAVE DRUGGED THEIR POSSETS,

108
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.830
THAT DEATH AND NATURE DO CONTEND ABOUT THEM,

109
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.200
WHETHER THEY LIVE OR DIE.

110
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.430
(man) WHO'S THERE?

111
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.630
ALACK, I AM AFRAID THEY HAVE AWAKED AND 'TIS NOT DONE.

112
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.600
THE ATTEMPT AND NOT THE DEED CONFOUNDS US.

113
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.330
[bird screeches]

114
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.330
HARK.

115
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.470
I LAID THEIR DAGGERS READY.

116
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.500
HE COULD NOT MISS 'EM.

117
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:39.100
HAD HE NOT RESEMBLED MY FATHER AS HE SLEPT,  I  HAD DONE 'T.

118
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.900
MY HUSBAND.

119
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.100
I HAVE DONE THE DEED.

120
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.830
DIDST THOU NOT HEAR A NOISE?

121
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.030
I HEARD THE OWL SCREAM AND THE CRICKETS CRY.

122
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.930
DID NOT YOU SPEAK?

123
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.100
WHEN?

124
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.100
NOW.

125
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.270
AS I DESCENDED?

126
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.270
AYE.

127
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.270
[gasps]

128
00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.670
WHO LIES I' THE SECOND CHAMBER?

129
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.170
DONALBAIN.

130
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.030
THIS IS A SORRY SIGHT.

131
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.830
FOOLISH THOUGHT, TO SAY A SORRY SIGHT.

132
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.930
THERE'S ONE DID LAUGH IN 'S SLEEP,

133
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.970
AND ONE CRIED, "MURDER!"

134
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.600
THAT THEY DID WAKE EACH OTHER. I STOOD AND HEARD THEM.

135
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.230
BUT THEN THEY DID SAY THEIR PRAYERS

136
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.300
AND ADDRESS THEM AGAIN TO SLEEP.

137
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.070
THERE ARE TWO LODGED TOGETHER.

138
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:25.330
ONE CRIED, "GOD BLESS US!" AND, "AMEN," THE OTHER,

139
00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.700
AS THEY HAD SEEN ME WITH THESE HANGMAN'S HANDS.

140
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.200
LISTENING THEIR FEAR, I COULD NOT SAY "AMEN"

141
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.800
WHEN THEY DID SAY "GOD BLESS US!"

142
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.470
CONSIDER IT NOT SO DEEPLY.

143
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.430
BUT WHEREFORE COULD I NOT PRONOUNCE "AMEN"?

144
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.400
I HAD MOST NEED OF BLESSING.

145
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.300
"AMEN" STUCK IN MY THROAT.

146
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.500
THESE DEEDS MUST NOT BE THOUGHT AFTER THESE WAYS.

147
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.870
SO IT WILL MAKE US MAD.

148
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.530
METHOUGHT I HEARD A VOICE CRY, "SLEEP NO MORE!

149
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.170
MACBETH DOES MURDER SLEEP!"

150
00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.700
THE INNOCENT SLEEP.

151
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.930
SLEEP THAT KNITS UP THE RAVELED SLEEVE OF CARE,

152
00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:59.170
THE DEATH OF EACH DAY'S LIFE, SORE LABOR'S BATH,

153
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.770
BALM OF HURT MINDS, GREAT NATURE'S SECOND COURSE,

154
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.970
CHIEF NOURISHER IN LIFE'S FEAST.

155
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.130
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

156
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.230
STILL IT CRIED, "SLEEP NO MORE!"

157
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.700
TO ALL THE HOUSE.

158
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.900
"GLAMIS HATH MURDERED SLEEP.

159
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.200
"THEREFORE CAWDOR SHALL SLEEP NO MORE.

160
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.030
MACBETH SHALL SLEEP NO MORE!"

161
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.570
WHO WAS IT THAT THUS CRIED?

162
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.770
WHY, WORTHY THANE,

163
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.900
YOU DO UNBEND YOUR NOBLE STRENGTH

164
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.370
TO THINK SO BRAINSICKLY OF THINGS?

165
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:31.470
GO, GET SOME WATER

166
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.700
AND WASH THIS FILTHY WITNESS FROM YOUR HANDS.

167
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.900
WHY DID YOU BRING THESE DAGGERS

168
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.270
FROM THE PLACE?

169
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.800
THEY MUST LIE THERE!

170
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.270
GO, CARRY THEM,

171
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.400
AND SMEAR THE SLEEPY GROOMS WITH BLOOD.

172
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.870
I'LL GO NO MORE.

173
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.100
I AM AFRAID TO THINK WHAT I HAVE DONE.

174
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.870
LOOK ON 'T AGAIN I DARE NOT.

175
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:01.030
INFIRM OF PURPOSE!

176
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.730
GIVE ME THE DAGGERS.

177
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.000
THE SLEEPING AND THE DEAD ARE BUT AS PICTURES.

178
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.870
'TIS THE EYE OF CHILDHOOD THAT FEARS A PAINTED DEVIL.

179
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.170
IF HE DO BLEED,

180
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.670
I'LL GUILD THE FACES OF THE GROOMS WITHAL,

181
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.770
FOR IT MUST SEEM THEIR GUILT.

182

[knocking at door]

183
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.470
WHENCE IS THAT KNOCKING?

184
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.270
HOW IS IT WITH ME WHEN EVERY NOISE APPALS ME?

185
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.570
[shudders]

186
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.330
WHAT HANDS ARE HERE?

187
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.770

189
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:49.230
WASH THIS BLOOD CLEAN FROM MY HAND?

190
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.100
NO.

191
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:56.600
THIS MY HAND WILL RATHER THE MULTITUDINOUS SEAS INCARNADINE,

192
00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.870
MAKING THE GREEN ONE RED.

193
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.930
MY HANDS ARE OF YOUR COLOR,

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.500
I HEAR A KNOCKING AT THE SOUTH ENTRY.

197
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.770
RETIRE WE TO OUR CHAMBER.

198
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:16.430
A LITTLE WATER CLEARS US OF THIS DEED.

199
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:17.830
HOW EASY IS IT, THEN.

200
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.030
YOUR CONSTANCY HATH LEFT YOU UNATTENDED.

201
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.330

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.530

[knocking]

212
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:06.370
HERE'S A KNOCKIN' INDEED.

213
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.670
IF A MAN WERE PORTER OF HELL GATE,

214
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.770
HE SHOULD HAVE OLD TURNIN' THE KEY.

215
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.400
[knocking]

216
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.500
KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK.

WHO'S THERE, I' THE NAME OF BEELZEBUB?

HERE'S A FARMER THAT HANGED HIMSELF

219
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.870
ON THE EXPECTATION OF PLENTY.

220
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.230

KNOCK, KNOCK!

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.230
WHO'S THERE, IN TH' OTHER DEVIL'S NAME?

225
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.370
FAITH, HERE'S AN EQUIVOCATOR,

226
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.830
THAT COULD SWEAR IN BOTH THE SCALES AGAINST EITHER SCALE,

227
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.630
WHO COMMITTED TREASON ENOUGH FOR GOD'S SAKE,

228
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.530
YET COULD NOT EQUIVOCATE TO HEAVEN.

229
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.830
OH, COME IN, EQUIVOCATOR.

230
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:52.100
KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK!

231
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.000

232
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.370
FAITH, HERE'S AN ENGLISH TAILOR COME HITHER,

233
00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.430
FOR STEALING OUT OF A FRENCH HOSE!

234
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.530
OH, COME IN, TAILOR!

235
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.400
HERE YOU MAY ROAST YOUR GOOSE.

236
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.230
KNOCK, KNOCK, NEVER AT QUIET?

237
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.100
WHAT ARE YOU?

238
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.600
THIS PLACE IS TOO COLD FOR HELL.

239
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.930
I'LL DEVIL-PORTER IT NO FURTHER.

240
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.770
I HAD THOUGHT TO HAVE LET IN SOME OF ALL PROFESSIONS

241
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:22.070
THAT GO THE PRIMROSE WAY TO EVERLASTING BONFIRE.

242
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.800
ANON, ANON!

243
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:30.770
I PRAY YOU REMEMBER THE PORTER!

244
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.870
WAS IT SO LATE, FRIEND,

245
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.070
ERE YOU WENT TO BED, THAT YOU DO LIE SO LATE?

246
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.530
FAITH, SIR, WE WERE CAROUSING TILL THE SECOND COCK!

247
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:44.000
AND DRINK, SIR, IS A GREAT PROVOKER OF THREE THINGS!

248
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.200
WHAT THREE THINGS DOES DRINK ESPECIALLY PROVOKE?

249
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.400
MARRY, SIR, NOSE-PAINTING, SLEEP, AND URINE.

250
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.070
LECHERY, SIR, IT PROVOKES AND UNPROVOKES.

251
00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.000
IT PROVOKES THE DESIRE,

252
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.370
BUT IT TAKES AWAY THE PERFORMANCE, SIR.

253
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.430
THEREFORE MUCH DRINK MAY BE SAID

254
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.170
TO BE AN EQUIVOCATOR WITH LECHERY.

255
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.630
IT MAKES HIM AND IT MARS HIM,

256
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.570
IT SETS HIM ON AND IT TAKES HIM OFF,

257
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.130
IT PERSUADES HIM AND DISHEARTENS HIM,

258
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.370
MAKES HIM STAND TO AND NOT STAND TO;

259
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.070
IN CONCLUSION,

260
00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:12.570
EQUIVOCATES HIM IN A SLEEP,

261
00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.230
AND GIVIN' HIM THE LIE, LEAVES HIM.

262
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:15.900
I BELIEVE DRINK GAVE THEE THE LIE.

263
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.830
THAT IT DID, SIR, I' THE VERY THROAT ON ME.

264
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.400
BUT I REQUITED HIM FOR HIS LIE,

265
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.830
AND, I THINK, BEING TOO STRONG FOR HIM,

266
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.730
THOUGH HE TOOK UP MY LEGS SOMETIME,

267
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.930
YET I MADE A SHIFT TO CAST HIM.

268
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.300
IS THY MASTER STIRRING?

269
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.530
[faint clanking noise]

270
00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.600
OUR KNOCKING HAS AWAKED HIM.

271
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.600
HERE HE COMES.

272
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.330
GOOD MORROW, NOBLE SIR.

273
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.600
GOOD MORROW, BOTH.

274
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.600
IS THE KING STIRRING, WORTHY THANE?

275
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.600
NOT YET.

276
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.530
HE DID COMMAND ME TO CALL TIMELY ON HIM.

277
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:42.930
I HAVE ALMOST SLIPPED THE HOUR.

278
00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:44.170
I'LL BRING YOU TO HIM.

279
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.100
I KNOW THIS IS A JOYFUL TROUBLE TO YOU,

280
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.200
BUT YET 'TIS ONE.

281
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.700
THE LABOR WE DELIGHT IN PHYSICS PAIN.

282
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.370
THIS IS THE DOOR.

283
00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:54.000
I'LL MAKE SO BOLD TO CALL, FOR 'TIS MY LIMITED SERVICE.

284
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.930
GOES THE KING HENCE TODAY?

285
00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.170
HE DOES. HE DID APPOINT SO.

286
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.600
THE NIGHT HAS BEEN UNRULY.

287
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.930
WHERE WE LAY, OUR CHIMNEYS WERE BLOWN DOWN,

288
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:09.370
AND, AS THEY SAY,  LAMENTINGS HEARD I' THE AIR,

289
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.870
STRANGE SCREAMS OF DEATH,

290
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.870
AND PROPHESYING WITH ACCENTS TERRIBLE

291
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:16.130
OF DIRE COMBUSTION AND CONFUSED EVENTS

292
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.930
NEW-HATCHED TO THE WOEFUL TIME.

293
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:21.300
THE OBSCURE BIRD CLAMORED THE LIVELONG NIGHT.

294
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.500
SOME SAY THE EARTH WAS FEVEROUS AND DID SHAKE.

295
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.970
'TWAS A ROUGH NIGHT.

296
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.500
MY YOUNG REMEMBRANCE CANNOT PARALLEL A FELLOW TO IT.

297
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.630
HORROR.

298
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.370
HORROR.  HORROR!

299
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:38.600
TONGUE NOR HEART CANNOT CONCEIVE NOR NAME THEE!

300
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.800

301
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.700
CONFUSION NOW HATH MADE HIS MASTERPIECE!

302

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:50.630
WHAT IS IT YOU SAY?

306
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.070
HIS MAJESTY?

307
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.200
APPROACH THE CHAMBER,

308
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.130
AND DESTROY YOUR SIGHTS WITH A NEW GORGON.

309
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.330
DO NOT BID ME SPEAK!

310
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.370

BANQUO AND DONALBAIN! MALCOLM!  AWAKE!

314
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.470
SHAKE OFF THIS DOWNY SLEEP, DEATH'S COUNTERFEIT,

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.470
AND LOOK ON DEATH ITSELF!

316
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:15.230
UP, UP AND SEE THE GREAT DOOM'S IMAGE!

317
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.430
MALCOLM AND BANQUO!

RING THE BELL!

321
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:25.970
[bell ringing]

322
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.270
WHAT'S THE BUSINESS,

323
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.470
THAT SUCH A TRUMPET CALLS TO PARLEY THE SLEEPERS?

324
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:30.470
SPEAK, SPEAK!

325
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:31.430
GENTLE LADY,

326
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.470
'TIS NOT FOR YOU TO HEAR WHAT I CAN SPEAK.

327
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.200
THE REPETITION, IN A WOMAN'S EAR,

328
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.030
WOULD MURDER AS IT FELL.

329
00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.130
O BANQUO, BANQUO!

330
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.370
OUR ROYAL MASTER'S MURDERED!

331
00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.070
WHAT, IN OUR HOUSE?

332
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:47.170
TOO CRUEL ANYWHERE!

333
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.500
DEAR DUFF, I PRITHEE, CONTRADICT THYSELF,

334
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.970
AND SAY 'TIS NOT SO.

335
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.130
HAD I BUT DIED AN HOUR BEFORE THIS CHANCE,

336
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.600
I HAD LIVED A BLESSED TIME,

337
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.270
FOR FROM THIS INSTANT

338
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.230
THERE'S NOTHING SERIOUS IN MORTALITY.

339
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.300
ALL IS BUT TOYS.

340
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.170
RENOWN AND GRACE IS DEAD.

341
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.900
THE WINE OF LIFE IS DRAWN,

342
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.070
AND THE MERE LEES IS LEFT TO BRAG OF.

343
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.500
WHAT IS AMISS?

344
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.000
YOU ARE, AND DO NOT KNOW 'T.

345
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.530
THE SPRING, THE HEAD,

346
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.600
THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUR BLOOD IS STOPPED.

347
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.030
THE VERY SOURCE IS STOPPED.

348
00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.570
YOUR ROYAL FATHER'S MURDERED.

349
00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:25.670
BY WHOM?

350
00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.370
THOSE OF HIS CHAMBER HAD DONE 'T.

351
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.570
THEIR HANDS AND FACES WERE ALL BADGED WITH BLOOD.

352
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:30.670
SO WERE THEIR DAGGERS,

353
00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.530
WHICH UNWIPED WE FOUND UPON THEIR PILLOWS.

354
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.170
THEY STARED AND WERE DISTRACTED.

355
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.100
NO MAN'S LIFE WAS TO BE TRUSTED WITH THEM.

356
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.230
I DO REPENT ME OF MY FURY, THAT I DID KILL THEM.

357
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.870
WHEREFORE DID YOU SO?

358
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.470
WHO CAN BE WISE,

359
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.900
AMAZED, TEMPERATE AND FURIOUS,

360
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.500
LOYAL AND NEUTRAL, IN A MOMENT?

361
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.500
NO MAN!

362
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.700
THE EXPEDITION OF MY VIOLENT LOVE

363
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.730
OUTRUN THE PAUSER REASON.

364
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.830
HERE LAY DUNCAN,

365
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.830
HIS SILVER SKIN LACED WITH HIS GOLDEN BLOOD,

366
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.600
AND HIS GASHED STABS LOOKED

367
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.300
LIKE A BREACH IN NATURE  FOR RUIN'S WASTEFUL ENTRY.

368
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.700
THERE, THE MURDERERS,

369
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.370
STEEPED IN THE COLORS OF THEIR TRADE,

370
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.300
THEIR DAGGERS BREECHED WITH GORE.

371
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.070
WHO COULD REFRAIN THAT HAD A HEART TO LOVE,

372
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.430
AND IN THAT HEART COURAGE TO MAKE HIS LOVE KNOWN?

373
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.700
HELP ME HENCE, HO!

374
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.130
LOOK TO THE LADY.

375
00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:29.100
WHY DO WE HOLD OUR TONGUES

376
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.030
THAT MOST MAY CLAIM THIS ARGUMENT FOR OURS?

377
00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.270
WHAT SHOULD BE SPOKEN HERE, WHERE OUR FATE,

378
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.300
HID IN AN AUGER HOLE, MAY RUSH AND SEIZE US?

379
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.030
LET'S AWAY.

380
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.770
OUR TEARS ARE NOT YET BREWED.

381
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:42.670
NOR OUR STRONG SORROW UPON THE FOOT OF MOTION.

382
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.300
(Banquo) LOOK TO THE LADY.

383
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:51.600
AND WHEN WE HAVE OUR NAKED FRAILTIES HID,

384
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.330
THAT SUFFER IN EXPOSURE,

385
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.730
LET US MEET AND QUESTION

386
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:57.270
THIS MOST BLOODY PIECE OF WORK,

387
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.070
TO KNOW IT FURTHER.

388
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:02.700
FEARS AND SCRUPLES SHAKE US.

389
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.670
IN THE GREAT HAND OF GOD I STAND

390
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:08.270
AND THENCE, AGAINST THE UNDIVULGED PRETENCE,

391
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.670
I FIGHT OF TREASONOUS MALICE.

392
00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:11.870
AND SO DO I.

393
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.170
(all) SO DO ALL.

394
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.870
LET'S BRIEFLY PUT ON MANLY READINESS,

395
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:16.500
AND MEET I' THE HALL TOGETHER.

396
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.930
(all) WELL CONTENTED.

397
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.270
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

398
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:23.370
LET'S NOT CONSORT WITH THEM.

399
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.430
TO SHOW AN UNFELT SORROW IS AN OFFICE

400
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:26.930
WHICH THE FALSE MAN DOES EASY.

401
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:29.130
I'LL TO ENGLAND.

402
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.900
TO IRELAND, I.

403
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.630
OUR SEPARATED FORTUNES SHALL KEEP US BOTH THE SAFER.

404
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:37.270
WHERE WE ARE THERE'S DAGGERS IN MEN'S SMILES.

405
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.870
THE NEAR IN BLOOD, THE NEARER BLOODY.

406
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.800
THIS MURDEROUS SHAFT HATH NOT YET LIGHTED,

407
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.730
AND THE SAFEST WAY IS TO AVOID THE AIM.

408
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.900
THEREFORE, TO HORSE,

409
00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.830
AND LET US NOT BE DAINTY OF LEAVE-TAKING,

410
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.000
BUT SHIFT AWAY.

411
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.570
THERE'S WARRANT IN THAT THEFT WHICH STEALS ITSELF

412
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.030
WHEN THERE'S NO MERCY LEFT.

413
00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:01.570
THREESCORE AND TEN I CAN REMEMBER WELL,

414
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.300
WITHIN THE VOLUME OF WHICH TIME

415
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.230
I HAVE SEEN HOURS DREADFUL AND THINGS STRANGE,

416
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:09.130
BUT THIS SORE NIGHT HATH TRIFLED FORMER KNOWINGS.

417
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.130
AH, GOOD FATHER,

418
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.330
THOU SEEST THE HEAVENS,

419
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.330
AS TROUBLED WITH MAN'S ACT, THREATENS HIS BLOODY STAGE.

420
00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.730
BY THE CLOCK 'TIS DAY,

421
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:21.600
AND YET DARK NIGHT STRANGLES THE TRAVELING LAMP.

422
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.400
IS 'T NIGHT'S PREDOMINANCE, OR THE DAY'S SHAME,

423
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.770
THAT DARKNESS DOES THE FACE OF EARTH ENTOMB

424
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.430
WHEN LIVING LIGHT SHOULD KISS IT?

425
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.170
'TIS UNNATURAL, EVEN LIKE THE DEED THAT'S DONE.

426
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.370
ON TUESDAY LAST A FALCON TOWERING IN HER PRIDE OF PLACE

427
00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.170
WAS BY A MOUSING OWL HAWKED AT AND KILLED.

428
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.330
AND DUNCAN'S HORSES--

429
00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:40.970
A THING MOST STRANGE AND CERTAIN--

430
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.170
BEAUTEOUS AND SWIFT, THE MINIONS OF THEIR RACE,

431
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.930
TURNED WILD IN NATURE, BROKE THEIR STALLS, FLUNG OUT,

432
00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.630
CONTENDING 'GAINST OBEDIENCE,

433
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.730
AS THEY WOULD MAKE WAR WITH MANKIND.

434
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.300
'TIS SAID THEY EAT EACH OTHER.

435
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.300
THEY DID SO,

436
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.030
TO THE AMAZEMENT OF MINE EYES,

437
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.300
THAT LOOKED UPON 'T.

438
00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.530
HERE COMES THE GOOD MACDUFF.

439
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.630
HOW GOES THE WORLD, SIR, NOW?

440
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.630
WHY, SEE YOU NOT?

441
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:10.400
IS 'T KNOWN WHO DID THIS MORE THAN BLOODY DEED?

442
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.830
THOSE THAT MACBETH HATH SLAIN.

443
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.300
ALAS THE DAY.

444
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.130
WHAT GOOD COULD THEY PRETEND?

445
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:19.700
THEY WERE SUBORNED.

446
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.170
MALCOLM AND DONALBAIN, THE KING'S TWO SONS,

447
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:24.670
ARE STOL'N AWAY AND FLED,

448
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.900
WHICH PUTS UPON THEM SUSPICION OF THE DEED.

449
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.400
'GAINST NATURE STILL.

450
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.070
THRIFTLESS AMBITION,

451
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.170
THAT WILT RAVIN UP THINE OWN LIFE'S MEANS.

452
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.530
THEN 'TIS MOST LIKE THE SOVEREIGNTY

453
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.070
WILL FALL UPON MACBETH.

454
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.400
HE IS ALREADY NAMED,

455
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.600
AND GONE TO SCONE TO BE INVESTED.

456
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.170
WHERE IS DUNCAN'S BODY?

457
00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.600
CARRIED TO COLMEKILL,

458
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.900
THE SACRED STOREHOUSE OF HIS PREDECESSORS

459
00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.430
AND GUARDIAN OF THEIR BONES.

460
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:54.430
WILL YOU TO SCONE?

461
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.800
NO, COUSIN. I'LL TO FIFE.

462
00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.270
WELL...

463
00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:01.600
I WILL THITHER.

464
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:08.600
WELL MAY YOU SEE THINGS WELL DONE THERE.

465
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:12.170
ADIEU,

466
00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:16.900
LEST OUR OLD ROBES SIT EASIER THAN OUR NEW.

467
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.400
FAREWELL, FATHER.

468
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.400
GOD'S BENISON GO WITH YOU,

469
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.870
AND WITH THOSE THAT WOULD MAKE GOOD OF BAD AND FRIENDS OF FOES.

470
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:44.070
