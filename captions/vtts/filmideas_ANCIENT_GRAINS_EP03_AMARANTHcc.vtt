00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.667
(upbeat music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
- [Voiceover] As we watch
the history of man unfold,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.166
we learn of a basic fact,

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.750
and that is nothing
stays the same.

00:00:38.917 --> 00:00:41.375
But when it comes to grains,

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:42.999
this hardly seems true,

00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:45.000
especially for the
ancient amaranth.

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.792
Amaranth is derived from
the Greek word amarantos,

00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:53.125
which means "one
that does not wither"

00:00:53.291 --> 00:00:55.917
or "the never fading."

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:57.750
This grain has
lived up to its name

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:00.999
because based on
historical data,

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:03.375
amaranth has been in
existence for 8,000 years.

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:07.375
If the Incas had quinoa,

00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:10.041
the Aztecs had amaranth

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:12.000
or huauhtli in
their native tongue.

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.959
The 1400s saw the rise
of the Aztec empire

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:19.417
as well as the propagation
of the amaranth grain.

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:22.917
Because it was a native
crop to Mesoamerica,

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:25.959
it was practical and convenient

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:27.917
for the Aztecs to cultivate it.

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:30.041
They had the largest amaranth
fields during that age.

00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:33.999
And amaranth became
their staple food source.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.583
As a matter of fact, 80% of
their total calorie intake

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.999
came from amaranth.

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:43.834
Aside from its major
role in the Aztec's diet,

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.999
amaranth also had
a substantial part

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:49.834
in their religious affairs.

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:51.792
The Aztecs would sculpt
images of their war god,

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:54.834
Huitilpochtli, using
amaranth grains,

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:57.834
honey, and sacrificial
human blood.

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:00.834
Then they would worship
and parade these sculptures

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:03.125
around the streets
of Tenochtitlan

00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:05.417
before the priests
break them into pieces

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:07.999
and distribute them to the
people for consumption,

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.083
a gesture symbolizing the
flesh and bones of the god.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.041
Unfortunately, this
religious practice

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:17.999
was condemned by the Spanish
conquistadors in the 1520s.

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:22.083
Pedro de Alvarado, the first
European who saw this ritual,

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:26.999
described it as a mockery
of the catholic communion.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.875
So Hernan Cortez, the leader
of the Spanish conquest,

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:35.041
in his goal of converting the
natives into Christianity,

00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:38.041
outlawed amaranth.

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:39.999
Anyone caught planting,
selling, and eating it

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.792
would be penalized by death.

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.999
The Spanish conquest
rendered amaranth useless.

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:48.792
It continued to grow on its own

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.999
but was considered a
weed rather than a crop.

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:54.500
This is probably the
reason why its genetic base

00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:57.250
remained unaltered
all these centuries.

00:02:57.417 --> 00:03:00.417
True to its name,
amaranth didn't fade

00:03:01.291 --> 00:03:03.792
or wither into obscurity.

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.999
From Central America, it
spread around the world

00:03:06.458 --> 00:03:09.999
all the way to Africa,
India, and Nepal.

00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:13.333
Amaranth is a pseudo grain

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.750
under the genus
classification Amaranthus.

00:03:16.917 --> 00:03:20.333
There are around 60 different
species of amaranth.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.999
And several of these are
cultivated up to this day.

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:27.625
Grown in large
areas in the north

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:30.458
and southwest of
the United States,

00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:32.917
are Amaranthus cruentus,

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:35.125
Amaranthus caudatus,

00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:37.667
and Amaranthus hypochondriacus.

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:41.000
While the species
Amaranthus blitum,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.500
Amaranthus dubius,

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:46.542
and Amaranthus tricolor

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.500
are planted and
consumed primarily

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:50.999
as a leafy vegetable, like
spinach in eastern Asia.

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:54.999
Amaranth is a low
maintenance crop

00:03:55.542 --> 00:03:57.583
which probably explains how it
survived all these centuries.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.250
Though it's best grown
in high altitudes,

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.208
it still thrives well
in low lying areas.

00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:07.542
It's adaptable to light,
loose, and moist soils.

00:04:08.083 --> 00:04:11.709
And it can tolerate almost
any temperature or climate.

00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:15.250
It can also grow in
sub-Sahara Africa

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:18.792
and similar topographies
where water is scarce,

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.999
especially during
the dry season.

00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:24.375
Amaranth is a tall plant

00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:27.375
averaging between five
and eight feet tall.

00:04:27.542 --> 00:04:30.125
Depending on the species,

00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:31.999
its broad leaves come in
maroon, yellow, and orange hues.

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:36.625
And its inflorescence ranges
from red, yellow, and green.

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:41.041
Its flowers can produce
60,000 seeds or grains,

00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:45.375
which are then processed
into flour and cereal.

00:04:45.542 --> 00:04:48.999
Amaranth may have been just a
weed at some point in history.

00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:52.999
But like a true weed,
it was resilient

00:04:53.083 --> 00:04:55.667
and adamant to survive and
regained its esteemed status

00:04:55.834 --> 00:04:59.667
among the grains in
the modern world.

00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:02.041
(upbeat music)

00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:11.875
Amaranth belongs to the genus
classification Amaranthus.

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:37.999
And while it's a fact that
it's not a true cereal grain,

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.959
its nutrient profile
is still at par

00:05:45.875 --> 00:05:48.083
with that of rice,
maize, and wheat.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.208
Protein is amaranth's
best redeeming feature.

00:05:58.083 --> 00:06:01.041
Some actually say that
its protein profile

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:03.917
can be described as
a complete protein

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:06.625
due to the high
levels of lysine,

00:06:06.792 --> 00:06:09.166
an amino acid deficient
in most whole grains.

00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:12.667
Its protein content
is also higher

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:19.125
compared to wheat and
other gluten-free grains.

00:06:19.291 --> 00:06:22.667
One cup of raw amaranth

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:26.792
is packed with 28.1
grams of protein,

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:30.375
while oats only come in
second at 26.3 grams,

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:35.999
followed by white rice at 13.1.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.083
In addition, molecular
biologists in Mexico

00:06:47.458 --> 00:06:50.458
reported in 2008 that there are

00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:52.999
lunasin-like peptides
in amaranth's protein.

00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:56.500
Lunasin is considered to
have anti-cancer properties

00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:03.999
as well as
anti-inflammatory properties

00:07:04.083 --> 00:07:06.959
that can fight
chronic conditions

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:09.000
like diabetes, heart
disease, and stroke.

00:07:09.166 --> 00:07:12.709
Like most grains,

00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:16.583
amaranth has cholesterol
lowering capabilities.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.917
In 2003 researchers at
the University of Guelph

00:07:20.542 --> 00:07:23.875
in Ontario, Canada,
reported amaranth's

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:26.250
rich amounts of phytosterols

00:07:26.417 --> 00:07:28.999
which can significantly
reduce blood cholesterol.

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:32.125
This was followed by another
scientific study in Russia

00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:39.083
in 2007 showing that
inclusion of amaranth

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.999
in the diets of patients
with cardiovascular diseases

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:46.417
helped regulate
their cholesterol,

00:07:46.583 --> 00:07:48.667
triglycerides, and LDL levels.

00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:51.583
Iron, calcium, and magnesium,

00:07:54.375 --> 00:07:56.999
these are amaranth's
top three minerals.

00:07:57.041 --> 00:07:59.999
Comparing it with
wheat and rice,

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.500
amaranth is undeniably superior.

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:07.166
Rice and wheat contain 0.8

00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:10.999
and 6.3 milligrams
of iron respectively

00:08:11.041 --> 00:08:14.375
whereas amaranth
contains 7.6 milligrams.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.542
Rice trails behind in magnesium
content at 25 milligrams.

00:08:22.999 --> 00:08:27.000
Wheat is significantly
higher at 239 milligrams.

00:08:29.999 --> 00:08:33.999
But amaranth is still at
the top with 248 milligrams.

00:08:34.417 --> 00:08:39.000
In terms of calcium content,

00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:41.999
rice and wheat don't
even come close.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.834
Rice only has 28 milligrams.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.917
Wheat only has 39 milligrams,

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.542
while amaranth has
159 milligrams.

00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:54.417
It is also a good source
of other dietary minerals

00:08:55.999 --> 00:08:58.999
such as potassium, zinc,
copper, and manganese.

00:08:58.999 --> 00:09:03.709
Amaranth is also
loaded with vitamins.

00:09:04.999 --> 00:09:07.500
It has vitamin A for
overall eye health.

00:09:09.166 --> 00:09:12.000
Vitamin B, specifically
thiamin, niacin, and riboflavin

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:17.999
for increased and
efficient metabolism.

00:09:17.999 --> 00:09:20.709
Folate for red blood
cell generation,

00:09:22.417 --> 00:09:25.208
anemia prevention,
and in the log run,

00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:27.999
decreased risk of dementia.

00:09:27.999 --> 00:09:30.208
Studies also reported
that there are

00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:33.375
small amounts of vitamin C
in amaranth leaves and oil.

00:09:33.542 --> 00:09:37.542
If many find amaranth's
colorful flowers and foliage

00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:44.625
perfect as ornaments, its
effects and contribution

00:09:44.792 --> 00:09:48.041
to one's health should be
highly regarded as well.

00:09:48.208 --> 00:09:51.542
Amaranth is one
tiny ancient seed

00:09:54.667 --> 00:09:56.834
that must not be
taken for granted.

00:09:56.999 --> 00:09:59.166
(upbeat music)

00:10:10.458 --> 00:10:12.458
Amaranth's fascinating history

00:10:28.999 --> 00:10:30.709
and impressive nutrient profile

00:10:30.875 --> 00:10:32.583
are not the only
factors that contribute

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.500
to its recent rise
to popularity.

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:37.041
Its adaptability and tolerance

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.999
to almost any type
of soil, temperature,

00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:49.999
climate, and elevation also
make it a global grain crop.

00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:54.625
It has established
itself as an important

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.959
and versatile crop, not
only in South America

00:10:59.999 --> 00:11:03.041
but all the way to
Greece and Asia.

00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:06.834
In the Aztec's book of accounts
called the Codex Mendoza,

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.500
the Emperor Montezuma received
20,000 tons of amaranth

00:11:16.083 --> 00:11:19.999
from his people as
annual tributes.

00:11:20.041 --> 00:11:22.750
During the Aztec month
of Panquetzaliztli,

00:11:25.417 --> 00:11:28.333
which in the modern calendar
is from December 7 to 26,

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.000
the Aztecs would fast
or eat very little

00:11:32.166 --> 00:11:34.959
as part of their festivities

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:36.417
dedicated to the
god Huitzilopochtli.

00:11:36.583 --> 00:11:39.625
And then they would partake in
the statue of Huitzilopochtli

00:11:42.166 --> 00:11:45.999
made from amaranth grain, honey,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.291
and even human
sacrificial blood.

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:50.625
Even though the Spanish
conquerors banned amaranth,

00:11:52.999 --> 00:11:55.875
it prevailed in the
traditional Mexican sweet bar

00:11:55.999 --> 00:11:58.667
called Alegria,
which means "joy."

00:11:58.834 --> 00:12:01.999
Amaranth grains are
popped, shaped into bars

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.999
with honey and sunflower
and pumpkin seeds.

00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:08.959
These Alegria bars
are often associated

00:12:10.208 --> 00:12:12.458
with the Mexican Dia de Muertos

00:12:12.625 --> 00:12:14.959
or Day of the Dead celebration.

00:12:14.999 --> 00:12:17.500
Amaranth's leaves and flowers,

00:12:21.333 --> 00:12:22.999
specifically that of the
Amaranthus cruentus species

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.667
also served a purpose for the
Native American tribe Zuni.

00:12:26.834 --> 00:12:30.999
The Zuni people would ground

00:12:32.999 --> 00:12:34.291
the feathery part of
the plant into a meal

00:12:34.458 --> 00:12:36.999
and use the plant's red hue

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.917
to color ceremonial breads.

00:12:38.999 --> 00:12:40.999
They would crush and moisten
the leaves and flowers

00:12:43.792 --> 00:12:46.291
and use them as blush
or rouge for cheeks.

00:12:46.458 --> 00:12:49.500
For the ancient Greeks,

00:12:52.917 --> 00:12:54.417
amaranth was a sacred
flower to Lady Ephesus,

00:12:54.583 --> 00:12:57.917
a distinct form of
the Goddess Artemis.

00:12:57.999 --> 00:13:00.917
It symbolized immortality

00:13:03.458 --> 00:13:05.375
and was used to ornate tubes
and sculptures of the gods.

00:13:05.542 --> 00:13:09.125
The seeds, leaves, and
roots of the species

00:13:11.667 --> 00:13:14.250
Amaranthus viridis and
Amaranthus spinosus

00:13:14.417 --> 00:13:17.667
have multiple
medicinal uses in Asia.

00:13:17.834 --> 00:13:20.625
Seeds are ground and
leaves are commonly used

00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:25.834
as a poultice or
dressing for wounds.

00:13:25.999 --> 00:13:28.750
In China it's used against
mild internal bleeding,

00:13:30.999 --> 00:13:34.000
dysentery,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.250
gastric ulcer,

00:13:37.625 --> 00:13:38.875
gallstones,

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.333
and as a topical for
boils and abscesses.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.041
In the Philippines the leaves
are used on insect bites,

00:13:45.542 --> 00:13:48.750
rashes,

00:13:49.583 --> 00:13:50.500
sunburn,

00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:52.417
as a topical for
eczema and psoriasis,

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:55.333
and to lower fever
due to infections.

00:13:56.792 --> 00:13:59.291
In India it's used
to treat indigestion,

00:14:00.999 --> 00:14:04.500
nausea,

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.208
and bladder infections.

00:14:07.208 --> 00:14:08.709
The root is chewed with salt
to alleviate toothaches.

00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:13.375
The stem is ground
for foot sores.

00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:16.999
And the seeds are
used to treat coughs.

00:14:17.041 --> 00:14:19.291
In Nepal,

00:14:21.291 --> 00:14:22.208
leaves are used to dress burns

00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:26.458
and together with the root,

00:14:26.625 --> 00:14:27.709
it's boiled as a
laxative for children

00:14:27.875 --> 00:14:30.125
and for excessive
menstrual bleeding.

00:14:30.291 --> 00:14:32.542
Malaysia, Cambodia, and Borneo

00:14:33.875 --> 00:14:35.999
also use amaranth to treat

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:38.041
similar medical and
health conditions.

00:14:38.208 --> 00:14:40.458
Ornament,

00:14:41.583 --> 00:14:42.166
food,

00:14:43.375 --> 00:14:43.999
herbal medicine.

00:14:45.458 --> 00:14:46.792
It seems like amaranth's
wonders are simply endless.

00:14:54.333 --> 00:14:57.999
(upbeat music)

00:15:10.999 --> 00:15:13.583
Like the ancient quinoa,

00:15:25.333 --> 00:15:26.959
amaranth is slowly
making a comeback.

00:15:27.999 --> 00:15:30.125
It was a forgotten crop
a few decades back.

00:15:34.458 --> 00:15:37.417
But in the 1970s
positive research results

00:15:38.375 --> 00:15:41.333
in the United States revitalized
the amaranth industry.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.125
Farmers started to cultivate it

00:15:49.875 --> 00:15:51.625
in unexpected
regions, such as Iowa,

00:15:51.792 --> 00:15:54.125
Nebraska,

00:15:55.792 --> 00:15:56.542
Missouri,

00:15:57.999 --> 00:15:58.875
North Dakota,

00:16:00.458 --> 00:16:01.250
and even New York.

00:16:02.667 --> 00:16:03.999
The National Academy of Sciences

00:16:18.917 --> 00:16:20.625
also recommended the
inclusion of amaranth

00:16:20.792 --> 00:16:23.125
to the American diet.

00:16:23.291 --> 00:16:24.999
Outside of South America
and the United States,

00:16:26.999 --> 00:16:29.750
amaranth is also now grown
and harvested in India,

00:16:29.917 --> 00:16:33.750
China,

00:16:35.291 --> 00:16:36.083
Russia,

00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:37.667
Thailand,

00:16:38.834 --> 00:16:39.583
Nigeria,

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:41.375
and the Czech Republic.

00:16:42.125 --> 00:16:43.500
Amaranth was also
germinated in outer space.

00:16:45.999 --> 00:16:49.250
Crew members experimented
on cultivating amaranth

00:16:55.041 --> 00:16:58.000
while on board the space
shuttle Atlantis in 1985.

00:16:58.166 --> 00:17:02.083
Amaranth cookies were
also a part of their menu

00:17:06.041 --> 00:17:08.750
during their flight.

00:17:08.917 --> 00:17:10.083
Flour is the top product
manufactured from amaranth.

00:17:19.083 --> 00:17:22.500
Bakers and patisseries
can actually replace

00:17:23.999 --> 00:17:26.709
25 to 30% of their
ordinary flour

00:17:26.875 --> 00:17:29.999
and wheat flour
with amaranth flour

00:17:29.999 --> 00:17:32.500
to get a higher quality
of protein in baked goods.

00:17:32.667 --> 00:17:36.208
Due to its versatility
and adaptability,

00:17:54.458 --> 00:17:57.417
amaranth is also one
of the several grains,

00:17:57.583 --> 00:18:00.500
along with quinoa,

00:18:00.667 --> 00:18:01.875
considered by
international governments

00:18:01.999 --> 00:18:03.999
and health organizations
that can solve malnutrition

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:07.625
and of course food security,

00:18:07.792 --> 00:18:09.625
especially in drought areas.

00:18:09.792 --> 00:18:11.709
In Mexico, amaranth's
native land,

00:18:12.709 --> 00:18:14.999
government officials
have launched efforts

00:18:15.041 --> 00:18:17.542
to revive grain
as a staple food.

00:18:17.709 --> 00:18:20.333
Motives behind this are not
only to foster and reinforce

00:18:21.709 --> 00:18:24.917
old Mexican traditions,

00:18:24.999 --> 00:18:26.917
but also to lay
down the groundwork

00:18:26.999 --> 00:18:28.999
of amaranth's future
socioeconomic viability.

00:18:29.125 --> 00:18:32.709
Corn is Mexico's
major produce today.

00:18:36.999 --> 00:18:39.917
But officials have speculated

00:18:40.999 --> 00:18:42.875
that with the current
changes in climate patterns,

00:18:42.999 --> 00:18:45.999
corn production will
decrease by the year 2080.

00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:49.291
And since amaranth is more
tolerant to high temperature,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.999
the future of the
country's crop production

00:18:54.083 --> 00:18:56.625
and industry lies in
this ancient grain.

00:18:56.792 --> 00:18:59.917
Mexico has also
included amaranth

00:19:07.041 --> 00:19:09.417
in its national
crusade against hunger

00:19:09.583 --> 00:19:11.999
to fight malnutrition
and obesity.

00:19:11.999 --> 00:19:14.625
Amaranth may have lost
its sacred vestiges.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.125
But it seems likely to remain

00:19:40.208 --> 00:19:42.166
and to provide sustenance
for generations to come.

00:19:45.041 --> 00:19:48.542
(upbeat music)

00:20:11.041 --> 00:20:13.875
The Aztecs had a
very interesting way

00:20:22.999 --> 00:20:24.999
of consuming and
enjoying amaranth grains.

00:20:25.041 --> 00:20:28.083
And thanks to modern cooking
techniques and recipes,

00:20:30.375 --> 00:20:33.250
amaranth with honey
and human blood

00:20:33.417 --> 00:20:35.834
is now out of the menu.

00:20:35.999 --> 00:20:37.625
The texture of cooked
amaranth is very unique

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.875
compared to most grains
that soften when boiled.

00:20:42.999 --> 00:20:45.959
Amaranth softens too,
but only on the inside.

00:20:46.875 --> 00:20:50.000
Its outer layer
retains its crunch,

00:20:51.291 --> 00:20:53.166
which is why amaranth grains
seem to pop when chewed.

00:20:53.333 --> 00:20:57.041
Amaranth absorbs more liquid,

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.500
so use the ratio
one is to three,

00:20:59.667 --> 00:21:01.999
one cup of grain to
three cups of water.

00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:04.792
To cook, just bring it to a boil

00:21:08.542 --> 00:21:10.875
and then let it simmer
for another 20 minutes

00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:13.208
or until grains are fluffy.

00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:15.417
For porridge recipes,

00:21:16.917 --> 00:21:17.999
just add another half
to one cup of water.

00:21:18.125 --> 00:21:20.999
You can also pop amaranth
seeds like popcorn.

00:21:22.667 --> 00:21:25.500
Over high heat, preheat a pot

00:21:26.583 --> 00:21:28.999
and put the seeds, one
tablespoon at a time.

00:21:29.125 --> 00:21:32.041
Wait until all seeds are popped,

00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:35.333
then remove from the pot.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.041
Popped amaranth can
be served with milk

00:21:38.583 --> 00:21:40.999
like any other cereal.

00:21:41.083 --> 00:21:42.917
Since amaranth is gluten free,

00:21:44.999 --> 00:21:47.083
breads and cookies made
from 100% amaranth flour

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.999
will not rise properly.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.959
That's why it's
advised to mix it

00:21:53.583 --> 00:21:55.375
with other flours with gluten
or starches (indistinct)

00:21:55.542 --> 00:21:58.750
that can perform as
leavening agents.

00:21:58.917 --> 00:22:01.625
Here are some recipes
using amaranth.

00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:06.999
First is blueberry
amaranth porridge.

00:22:08.667 --> 00:22:10.999
You will need 1 1/2
cups of amaranth,

00:22:12.125 --> 00:22:14.291
2 1/2 cups of water,

00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:16.166
2 1/2 cups of milk,

00:22:16.333 --> 00:22:18.166
two tablespoons of butter,

00:22:18.333 --> 00:22:20.041
1/3 cup of heavy cream,

00:22:20.208 --> 00:22:22.208
1/2 cup of blueberries,

00:22:22.375 --> 00:22:24.375
and four tablespoons
of maple syrup.

00:22:25.041 --> 00:22:27.417
Put a saucepan over high heat.

00:22:29.417 --> 00:22:31.458
Then combine amaranth,
water, milk, and butter.

00:22:31.625 --> 00:22:34.999
Bring it to a boil.

00:22:35.583 --> 00:22:36.999
Simmer for 20 minutes
and stir occasionally

00:22:37.709 --> 00:22:40.417
to achieve a thicker
and creamier texture,

00:22:40.583 --> 00:22:42.999
then whisk in heavy
cream and blueberries,

00:22:43.999 --> 00:22:46.542
scoop the mixture
into serving bowls

00:22:47.417 --> 00:22:49.417
and drizzle with maple syrup.

00:22:49.583 --> 00:22:51.750
The second recipe is
amaranth chicken stew.

00:22:52.625 --> 00:22:55.291
Just prepare one cup
of cooked amaranth,

00:22:56.792 --> 00:22:59.208
one kilogram of boneless
and skinless chicken breast,

00:22:59.959 --> 00:23:02.959
six cups of water,

00:23:03.333 --> 00:23:04.583
a pinch of basil,

00:23:05.041 --> 00:23:06.166
a pinch of rosemary,

00:23:06.333 --> 00:23:07.917
a pinch of black pepper,

00:23:07.999 --> 00:23:09.542
and a teaspoon of minced garlic.

00:23:09.709 --> 00:23:11.999
Slow cook chicken
along with the spices

00:23:13.999 --> 00:23:16.583
in a crockpot of water
for about six hours.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.959
You can keep the
chicken breasts whole

00:23:20.875 --> 00:23:22.583
or you can first chop
it into smaller pieces

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.208
while inside the pot.

00:23:25.375 --> 00:23:26.959
Then put the cooked amaranth,

00:23:27.291 --> 00:23:28.500
stir well, and serve.

00:23:28.667 --> 00:23:30.792
Amaranth may have
had a bloody past,

00:23:33.291 --> 00:23:35.792
but that will not stop
this unfading grain

00:23:36.333 --> 00:23:38.875
from reclaiming fame.

00:23:38.999 --> 00:23:40.999
Actually, as more and more
people turn to healthier foods,

00:23:40.999 --> 00:23:44.834
amaranth's luster
only seems to shine

00:23:44.999 --> 00:23:47.667
even brighter tomorrow
and in the years to come.

00:23:47.834 --> 00:23:50.999
(upbeat music)
