<i>THESE FAMILIES ARE THE
SUBJECT OF THIS FILM.</i>

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.300
<i>>> WHAT MIGHT THE
AVERAGE PERSON THINK</i>

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.760
<i>OF THESE FAMILIES?</i>

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.100
<i>WE HEAD OUT TO MAIN
STREET USA TO FIND OUT.</i>

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.960
>> I THINK IT'S POSITIVE.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.730
DEFINITELY.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.030
>> GROWING UP
IN A GAY FAMILY?

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.400
>> I THINK THAT THEY
MIGHT BE MORE TOLERANT

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.730
OF OTHERS.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.030
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE
CONFLICTING FOR THE

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.160
CHILDREN.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.900
THEY HAVE TWO DADS OR TWO
MOMS, BUT YET ONE OF THEM

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.230
IS SUPPOSED TO BE A MOM,
ONE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.500
DAD, YOU KNOW.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.530
>> WELL A LOT OF PEOPLE
CONSIDER IT UNNATURAL.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.600
>> I THINK THAT THE
GENERAL PUBLIC THOUGH

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.230
FEELS, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
TO HAVE A MOM AND A DAD.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.830
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE MALE
ROLE MODELS AND OF THE

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.000
FEMALE ROLE MODELS.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.130
BUT YOU KNOW, I FEEL THAT
YOU CAN GET THAT FROM

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.700
GRANDPARENTS OR
FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.800
>> YOU KNOW, IF THEY CAN
BE RESPONSIBLE PARENTS AND

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.000
RAISE THE KIDS IN A
MORALLY CORRECT MANNER,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.960
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
WITH IT WHATSOEVER.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.500
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY
STRONG OPINION,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.630
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.800
I THINK PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.330
AND I THINK TO THE EXTENT
THAT THEY HAVE GOOD MORALS

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.660
REGARDLESS OF THEIR SEXUAL
ORIENTATION, IF THEY HAVE

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.700
KIDS AND THEY
CAN RAISE KIDS.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.830
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.100
<i>>> A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T
SHARE YOUR POINT OF VIEW.</i>

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.960
<i>WHAT TO YOU THINK THEIR
MAJOR CONCERNS ARE?</i>

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.660
>> WELL I THINK
PEOPLE ARE SCARED.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.300
FEAR IS ALWAYS A BIG
DRIVER FOR OPINIONS.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.400
SO PEOPLE THAT DON'T
UNDERSTAND ANOTHER

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.060
LIFESTYLE TEND TO FEAR IT.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.630
<i>>> BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
TEND TO HAVE RESERVATIONS</i>

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.760
<i>ABOUT SUCH THINGS.</i>

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.630
<i>WHERE DO YOU THINK THAT
COMES FROM AND WHY ARE</i>

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.730
<i>THEY SO AFRAID?</i>

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.060
>> THAT'S THAT RIGHT-WING
MORAL RELIGIOUS WHATEVER

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.960
THEY GOT IN THEIR HEAD.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.100
THAT'S JUST A
BUNCH OF GARBAGE.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.200
>> I THINK IT'S
A GOOD IDEA.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.400
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
THAT AMERICA CAUGHT UP

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.630
WITH THE REST OF EUROPE
AND THE WORLD AND WOKE UP

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.560
AND SAID THIS IS THE WAY
IT'S GOING TO BE AND IT'S

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.500
NOT GOING TO GO AWAY.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.900
SO THEY SHOULD BE
EDUCATED ON IT.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.100
WELL I COME FROM IRELAND
WHERE IT'S 99.9% CATHOLICS

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.400
AND IT'S SOMETHING WHICH
TRADITIONALLY WE'RE

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.000
SUPPOSED TO BE AGAINST.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.100
AND IF IRELAND CAN CHANGE
ITS POINT OF VIEWS, I'M

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.430
SURE AMERICA CAN.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.100
<i>>> SIX FAMILIES HAVE

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.200

<i>SUBJECT OF THIS
DOCUMENTARY.</i>

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.360
<i>WE'LL BEGIN WITH TWO
FAMILIES THAT STARTED WITH</i>

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.760
<i>CLINIC INSEMINATIONS.</i>

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.760
<i>HERE ARE VIOLA AND LESLEE
WITH THEIR SON SAM.</i>

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.460
<i>LESLEE AND VI HAVE BEEN IN
A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP</i>

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.160
<i>FOR 25 YEARS.</i>

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.800
<i>LESLIE HAD SAM VIA DONOR
INSEMINATION 18 YEARS AGO.</i>

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.630
<i>AND SHE AND VI HAVE
RAISED SAM IN THEIR QUIET</i>

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.660
<i>SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD.</i>

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.360
<i>>> SUSAN AND COREEN
WERE IN A COMMITTED</i>

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.500

FOR SEVEN YEARS.</i>

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.960

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.060
<i>WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER
SUSAN GAVE BIRTH</i>

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.660
<i>TO MEGGAN.</i>

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.760
<i>THREE YEARS LATER COREEN
HAD TRIPLET BOYS, JESSE,</i>

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.530
<i>ANTHONY AND ORION.</i>

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.560
<i>BOTH PREGNANCIES WERE
THE RESULT OF DONOR</i>

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.830
<i>INSEMINATION BY
THE SAME DONOR.</i>

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.300
>> IT WAS AN EARLY
CONVERSATION THAT WHEN

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.530
COREEN AND I WERE FIRST
TOGETHER WE HAVE HAD.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.660
AND I REALLY BEFORE THAT
DIDN'T FORESEE CHILDREN IN

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.200
MY FUTURE BECAUSE OF THE
LIFESTYLE THAT I LEAD.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.800
BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY
IN COREEN'S FUTURE.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.760
AND SO WE HAD EXTENSIVE
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.630
AND I DID WANT CHILDREN IN
MY LIFE, GROWING UP WITH A

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.400
FAMILY, BEING SECOND OUT
OF SIX IN A LARGE FAMILY.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.200
SO WE EDUCATED OURSELVES,
AND HERE WE ARE, GOT KIDS.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.500
>> SO WHAT OPTIONS
DID YOU CONSIDER?

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.430
>> SUE: WE
CONSIDERED ADOPTION.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.200
AND THEN IN VITRO.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.930
OR ACTUALLY, INTRAUTERINE
INSEMINATION.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.030
WE TALKED ABOUT ADOPTION,
BUT WE WANTED, IF WE COULD

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.960
TO HAVE OUR OWN CHILDREN.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.660
TO TRY TO START
WITH THAT FIRST.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.060
AND THEN IF THERE WERE ANY
BARRIERS TO THAT, THEN

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.660
LOOKING AT ADOPTION.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.830
>> IT WAS PROBABLY TWO
YEARS BEFORE THAT.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.300
TWO OR THREE YEARS AS
SAYING "NO, YOU DO IT.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.930
NO, I'LL DO IT.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.130
NO, YOU DO IT." .

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.930
OR VI SAYING "WE PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T DO IT." .

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.160
>> I DIDN'T WANT TO.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.100
I JUST THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE TOO HARD.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.060
ON HIM, NOT SO MUCH
US, BUT HIS LIFE.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.660
>> WHAT WERE YOU
WORRIED ABOUT?

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.130
>> VIOLA: SOCIAL
PRESSURES.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.900
>> LIKE WHAT?

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.200
GIVE US SOME
EXAMPLES OF WHAT.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.560
>> VIOLA: BEING SET APART.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.130
VERY DIFFERENT
FROM THE GET-GO.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.260
NOT SO MUCH HIM, BUT US.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.730
AND THAT KIND OF PRESSURE
THAT WOULD BE PUT UPON A

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.660
YOUNG PERSON, I
THOUGHT WAS TOO MUCH.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.460
>> SO DID YOU TRY
TALKING HER OUT OF IT?

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.360
>> LESLEE: OH YEAH.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.200
AND SEE, IT WORKED.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.300
IT WORKED.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.100
SO YEAH, I MEAN, I SAID
"NO, WE CAN DO IT." .

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.830
BACK IN, WHAT I'M CALLING
BACK IN THE DAY; IT SOUNDS

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.530
LIKE IT WAS A LONG TIME
AGO; MY OB/GYN, I SPOKE TO

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.600
HIM ABOUT THAT.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.360
NOT BEING A GAY WOMAN, I
SPOKE TO HIM AS BEING A

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.930
SINGLE PARENT WHOSE
BIOLOGICAL CLOCK IS

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.230
TICKING AND HEY, THIS
IS WHAT I WANT TO DO.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.230
SO HE AND HIS NURSE
MADE ARRANGEMENTS.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.300
AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT THE DONOR.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.600
THEY TOLD US HE WAS
A MEDICAL STUDENT.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.560
THAT HE WAS MARRIED.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.060
AND HE WAS 6 FOOT 1 OR 2.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.960
AND THAT'S ABOUT
ALL WE KNOW.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.930
I DON'T KNOW, THEY
COULD'VE GONE DOWN THE

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.830
HALLWAY AND
SAID "HEY, YOU." .

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.500
<i>>> OUR NEXT FAMILIES

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.360
LIKE JUST DEALING WITH MY
TWO CHILDREN AS BEST AS I

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.930
POSSIBLY CAN AND BEING
PATIENT AND LOVING.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.530
AND YOU KNOW, LIKE HAVING
ENOUGH SLEEP SO I CAN MAKE

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.360
THE BEST DECISION.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.760
THOSE KINDS OF
THINGS, RIGHT.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.260
AND THAT WE DO THAT
TOGETHER AS A FOURSOME

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.860
DOESN'T MAKE THAT ANY
DIFFERENT REALLY THAN I

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.960
IMAGINE WHAT
MOST PEOPLE DO.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.560
AND IT'S LIKE, WELL THIS
KID HAS A PARTICULAR

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.260
CHALLENGE.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.660
HOW DO WE PARENT HIM BEST?

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.330
RIGHT.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.560
AND THAT SEEMS TO BE...

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.560
FOR ME RIGHT NOW, I WOULD
SAY THAT'S THE MOST

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.500
CHALLENGING THING.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.400
BEING AN OUT GAY
DAD IS LIKE...

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.230
<i>>> IT'S MINOR</i>

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:01.830
>> GEOFFREY: IT'S
REALLY MINOR.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.600
>> I HAD ALWAYS
WANTED TO BE A PARENT.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.700
I HAD ALWAYS WANTED
TO HAVE KIDS.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.530
BUT I'M VERY MUCH A
WORKAHOLIC AND VERY MUCH

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.860
DEVOTED TO MY CAREER.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.560
AND KNEW AS A GAY MAN IT
WAS UNLIKELY THAT I'D EVER

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.000
HAVE KIDS.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.800
AND SO IT WAS SORT OF
AN IDEAL SITUATION

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.530
TO STUMBLE INTO.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.860
AND NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE
KIDS, BUT IT REALLY IS...

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.300
I CAN'T FATHOM
BEING A DUAL PARENT.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.030
I MEAN, I CAN'T IMAGINE
JUST TWO PARENTS.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:36.360
I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT YOU'D
HAVE TIME TO DO ANYTHING

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.030
AND BE YOURSELF STILL
WHILE YOU'RE RAISING

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.100
YOUR KIDS.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.530
AND SO IT'S ACTUALLY, IT
REALLY IS SORT OF A VERY

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.160
PRIVILEGED AND IDEAL
SITUATION TO BE IN.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.030
>> SO WE MOVED HERE.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.260
AND ONLY AFTER WE MOVED
HERE DID WE START TALKING

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.960
WITH CARYN ABOUT
TO CO-PARENTING.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.400
WE HAVE HAD OUR OWN
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IF WE

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.700
WANTED TO BECOME PARENTS,
AND IF YES HOW WE WOULD

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.560
THEN DO IT.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.260
SO THE FIRST STAGE WAS THE
PROCESS OF DECIDING TO

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.430
BECOME PARENTS.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.260
>> AND SO FOR GAY MEN LIKE
US, WHO'VE BEEN GAY THE

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.700
BULK OF OUR ADULT LIVES,
THE THREE OPTIONS ARE

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.230
SURROGACY, ADOPTION
OR CO-PARENTING.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:15.730
SURROGACY FOR ME
JUST DOESN'T WORK.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:21.330
THE SYMBOLICNESS OF USING,
PAYING ANOTHER WOMAN TO

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.160
USE HER WOMB JUST DOESN'T
RESONATE WITH ME.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.860
I KNOW PEOPLE WHO WHO'VE
DONE IT AND I HAVE NO

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.500
JUDGMENT AGAINST THEIR
DECISIONS, BUT FOR ME IT

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.260
JUST SEEMS NOT SOMETHING
I WAS WILLING TO DO.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.560
>> DAVID: THERE'S
SOME JUDGMENT.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.800
>> GREG: IT'S ALSO
VERY EXPENSIVE.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.960
AND ACTUALLY FRANKLY,
WE COULDN'T AFFORD IT.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:44.030
ADOPTION INVOLVES THE
STATE IN A LEGAL WAY IN

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.560
VERY INTIMATE DETAILS
OF OUR LIVES THAT FELT

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.530
ACTUALLY VERY INTRUSIVE
AND DISRESPECTFUL.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.230
>> DAVID: THE WHOLE IDEA
OF HAVING A STATE HAVE TO

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.030
SANCTIFY OUR FAMILY WAS
SOMETHING THAT I WAS NOT

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.300
AT ALL INTERESTED IN.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.160
SO WE ACTUALLY PRETTY...

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.960
FRANKLY WE WERE
ELIMINATING WAYS OF HAVING

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.000
FAMILIES QUICKER THAN WE
WERE COMING UP WITH WAYS

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.830
TO ACTUALLY HAVE FAMILIES.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.930
<i>>> TWO OF THESE FAMILIES

JUST SO MUCH TRYING

YOU KNOW, THE NURTURING

NATURE THAT THEY BOTH HAD
AND HOW MUCH THEY LOVED

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.100
EACH OTHER AND HAD BEEN
TOGETHER FOR SO LONG.

MINUTES ON THE PHONE, BUT

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:54.500

ME STRAIGHT TO

GOD WAS IN THE ROOM

POSSIBILITY FOR US.

YES, IT'S TRUE.

THERE IS PROOF BEHIND THE

THEORY THAT GAY PARENTS
CAN RAISE GOOD CHILDREN IN

SOCIAL SERVICES AS A
COUPLE IF WE WERE WILLING

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.730
TO ADOPT THEM TOGETHER.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:57.630
AND AT THAT TIME, EVINN
ACTUALLY WAS NOT EVEN IN

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.530
THE PICTURE, IT
WAS JUST MORGAN.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.760
AND WE WERE GETTING
EVERYTHING TAKEN CARE OF

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.260
AND THE NECESSARY
THINGS TO TAKE MORGAN

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.400
PERMANENTLY.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.900
AND THEY INFORMED US THAT
THERE WAS ANOTHER BABY ON

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.230
THE WAY, AND THAT IF WE
WANTED TO TAKE MORGAN WE

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.860
NEEDED TO TAKE THE BABY.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.260
SO WE BECAME INVOLVED
AT THAT POINT.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.860
>> DO YOU THINK MORGAN AND
EVINN'S BEING WITH YOU IS

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.560
BETTER THAN BEING WITH
THEIR BIOLOGICAL PARENTS?

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.260
>> JEANNIE: OH YES.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.330
>> MARY: ABSOLUTELY.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.230
THEY WERE IN A DRUG
INFESTED FILTHY HOME THAT

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.600
PUBLIC HEALTH DIDN'T EVEN
WANT ANYBODY TO LIVE IN,

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.300
LET ALONE A CHILD.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.900
AND THAT WAS WHAT MORGAN
WAS IN FOR TWO YEARS.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.430
AND NO MATTER AGAIN WHAT
WE DID DO; CLEAN THE

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.830
HOUSE, TO DO THINGS TO
PROVIDE SUPPORT, PROVIDE

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.830
HOUSECLEANING, WHAT SOCIAL
SERVICES DID TO PROVIDE

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.700
PARENTING, ALL
OF THOSE THINGS.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.830
WHAT WE ALL DID FOR
FURNITURE, YOU NAME IT.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.360
ALL THE NECESSARY SUPPORTS
TO PROVIDE A HOME.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.930
NONE OF THAT EVER LASTED.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:51.900
>> GETTING THE
SERVICES THEY NEED.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.900
THEY'RE IN A STABLE
SAFE ENVIRONMENT.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.430
THEY KNOW THAT THEY
WILL NOT BE LEFT ALONE.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.300
THEY KNOW THAT WE WILL
PICK THEM UP AFTER SCHOOL.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:06.130
THEY KNOW THEY GET FED,
THREE, FOUR, FIVE TIMES

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.430
A DAY.

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.860
THE BABY TENDS TO GRAZE.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.000
>> MARY: SHE
GRAZES ALL DAY.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.960
>> JEANNIE: SHE WOULD EAT
ALL DAY IF WE LET HER.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.060
>> MARY: SHE WOULD.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.330
>> JEANNIE: THEY
ABSOLUTELY KNOW WHO THEIR

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.530
FAMILY IS.

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:19.300
MORGAN'S GOING TO HAVE A
BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR THE

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.700
>> WELL, A
COUPLE OF THEM...

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.060
THE CHILDREN ASSUME THAT
THEY'RE GAY JUST BECAUSE

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.760
THEY HAVE GAY PARENTS.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.060

>> BUT YOUR KIDS ARE NOT
ASSUMING THAT THEY'RE GAY?

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.360
>> COREEN: NO.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.500
THEY DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GAY AT ALL.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.760

>> YOU HAVE
THE SAME DONOR.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.030
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.460
>> SOMEONE DONATED
SPERM TO...

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:43.330
BECAUSE MOM DOESN'T
LIKE MEN OR WHATEVER.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.000
BOTH OF OUR MOMS WANTED
THE SAME DONOR SO WE COULD

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.330
BE BROTHER AND SISTER
OR BROTHER AND BROTHER,

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.960
WHATEVER IT WOULD BE.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.430

OVER, AND THEN THEY CAME

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.860
OVER AND HE WENT HOME
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.560
THAT I HAD TWO MOMS.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:02.160
AND IT SCARED HIM BECAUSE
HE'S NEVER BEEN AROUND TWO

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.400
AT THE SAME TIME.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:08.530

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.130
MY MOM WAS GAY.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:14.160
SO I GOT IN THIS HUGE
FIGHT WITH FISTS LIKE

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.060
SOCKING, AND THAT'S
HOW I GOT SUSPENDED.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.200
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.860
IT'S LIKE TWO DADS STILL
DON'T LOVE YOU MORE THAN

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.000
TWO MOMS.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
OUR TWO MOMS DON'T LOVE
YOU MORE THAN TWO DADS OR

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.930
A MOM AND A DAD.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.900
>> SUE: WHEN SHE WAS READY
TO START ASKING QUESTIONS,

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.630
IT'S THE TIME THAT THEY'RE
READY TO START HEARING

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:32.730
THE ANSWERS.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.360
SO I TERMED IT THAT THERE
ARE SOME FATHERS THAT...

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:40.360
DADS ARE OUT THERE THAT
ARE MEANT TO BE, HELP TO

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.460
GET MOMMIES PREGNANT, BUT
THEY'RE NOT REALLY IN

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.600
YOUR LIFE.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.100
AND SO WE JUST EXPLAINED
IT THAT WAY AND SHE SEEMED

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.130
OKAY WITH THE ANSWER.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.960
IF SHE WERE TO ASK
QUESTIONS, THEN I WOULD

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.030
GIVE HER MORE.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.230
AND IT'S THE SAME
WITH THE BOYS.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.300
THEY WERE...

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.400
IT WAS INTERESTING THAT
THEY'D ROLE-PLAY AND ONE

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.800
OF THEM, THE BOYS WOULD BE
THE MOM OR THE BOYS WOULD

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.260
BE A DAD.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.460
SO THEY WOULD KIND OF
WORK THINGS OUT IN THEIR

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.460
CHILDHOOD WAY
THAT THEY COULD.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.200
BUT THEN THEY WOULD ASK
QUESTIONS AS WELL AND WE

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.200
WOULD EXPLAIN THE WHOLE
SCENARIO OVER AGAIN.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.060
YOU HAVE TWO MOMS.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.360
YOU HAD A DONOR DADDY WHO
WAS VERY WONDERFUL IN

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.430
BEING ABLE TO HELP OTHER
PEOPLE HAVE CHILDREN.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.560

EXPLAINED TO THEM, IT'S

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:38.630

WENT TO A SPERM BANK.

TWO HETEROSEXUAL
FAMILIES THERE.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.860

WAS LOOKING.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:49.860
HE SAW SOMETHING THAT
LOOKED LIKE HIS WORLD AND

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.400

BUT BEING AWARE OF THAT,

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.060
STIGMA YET OR IS IT
DIFFERENT IN SOME KIND OF

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:30.200
AND MOST OF THE TIME THOSE
RELIGIOUS PEOPLE END UP,

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.200
YOU KNOW, HAVING
A GAY CHILD.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.900
AND THEN WHAT'S THAT GAY
CHILD GOT TO GO THROUGH?

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.360
YOU KNOW, THAT POOR KID'S
GOING TO BE STUCK IN THE

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:44.130
HOUSE AND END UP HAVING
TO GO THROUGH PSYCHOLOGY

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:45.800
OR...

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.930
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:47.760
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.800
>> COREEN: THERAPY.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.430
BECAUSE HIS PARENTS
DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.630
WHEREAS I UNDERSTAND IF
THEY'RE STRAIGHT, I'M NOT

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.230
GOING TO MAKE THEM FEEL
LIKE THEY SHOULDN'T

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:57.400
BE ALIVE.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.360
WHEREAS THOSE PARENTS MAKE
THOSE KIDS FEEL LIKE THEY

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.060
SHOULDN'T BE ALIVE.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.830
THEY GET INTO HIGH SCHOOL
AND THEY COMMIT SUICIDE,

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:05.360
BECAUSE THOSE PARENTS
DON'T SUPPORT THEM.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.130
I JUST THINK IT'S FOOLISH.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:12.030
>> STEVE: MY RESPONSE TO
THAT IS NARROWMINDEDNESS.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:20.360
IT AMAZES ME HOW MANY
PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.500
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:27.000
WE'VE GONE TO A TINY TOWN;
JOHN'S FROM A SMALL TOWN

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.200
ON THE EASTERN PLAINS,
AND WE WERE OUT SOMEPLACE

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.360
THERE JUST RECENTLY.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.730
AND I HAD PEOPLE COMING UP
TO ME, MEN COMING UP TO ME

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:39.000
AND SAYING "WOW, IT IS SO
GREAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING." .

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.860
THEY KNOW THE STORY.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.060
THEY KNOW WE'RE GAY.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.260
THEY DON'T SPEAK OF IT,
BUT THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.100
ON AND THEY ARE
SUPPORTIVE.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.660
SO WHEN PEOPLE REALLY KNOW
YOU AND THEY KNOW YOUR

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.160
INTENTION...

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.800
IT'S SUDDENLY NOT
EVEN AN ISSUE.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:04.000
I HAVE FEARS ABOUT THE
TIME WHEN HE MAYBE GETS

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.730
ANGRY, THAT HE IS...

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.760
THAT HE GREW UP IN A
NON-TRADITIONAL FAMILY.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.900
BECAUSE IT MAY
BE A STRUGGLE.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.700
AND I HAVE AT TIMES FEARS
ABOUT THAT, ABOUT THAT

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.460
CONVERSATION THAT I HAVE
WITH HIM, OF HIM RUNNING

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:23.260
TO GO MOVE OUT AND YOU
KNOW, BEING MAD AT US.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:30.060
BUT JOHN'S MUCH MORE
LEVELHEADED THAN I AM AND

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:38.130
HE, I THINK HE PROVIDES
THE STEADY PERSPECTIVE.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:42.530
AND I'M REMINDED EASILY
WHEN I'M WITH JOHN THAT AS

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.600
MUCH AS WE'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO OFFER HIM, I THINK

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.330
HE'S GOING TO BE A
REALLY HAPPY KID.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.730
<i>>> A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD
SAY THAT THIS IS IMMORAL,</i>

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:49.830
<i>THIS IS WRONG.</i>

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.360
>> JEANNIE: WELL THAT'S
A POLITICAL AGENDA.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.000
THAT IS NOT A CHRISTIAN
MORAL AGENDA.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.960
AND AGAIN, YOU KNOW, TAKE
A LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.300
DOING.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.400
HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE
ADOPTED SPECIAL NEEDS

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.730
KIDS?

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.930
YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL ABOUT
TAKING KIDS AWAY FROM US,

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.700
BUT YOU DON'T SEE THEM
DOING ANYTHING FOR THE

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.860
CHILDREN.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.630
FOR THEM, THIS IS NOT
ABOUT THE CHILDREN, THIS

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:11.600
IS ABOUT THEIR OWN
POLITICAL AGENDA.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:17.060
AND SO I SAY SCREW THEM,
IF I CAN BE THAT BLUNT.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.660
WHAT REALLY ANGERS ME
ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.400
WOULD PREVENT US FROM BOTH
ADOPTING THESE KIDS IS THE

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.160
FACT THAT, FIRST OF ALL,
THIS IS NOT A GAY RIGHTS

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.730
ISSUE, THIS IS NOT A GAY
MARRIAGE ISSUE, THIS IS A

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.730
CHILDREN'S RIGHTS ISSUE.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:34.230
AND THEY ARE GOING TO
LIVE WITH US, REGARDLESS.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.830
WHETHER WE BOTH ADOPT THEM
OR ONE OF US ADOPTS THEM.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:38.900
BUT BY BOTH OF US BEING
ABLE TO ADOPT THEM, WHAT

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.930
THIS GUARANTEES
IS THEIR FUTURE.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:45.460
INSURANCE, SOCIAL SECURITY
BENEFITS, SHOULD EITHER

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.830
ONE OF US DIE, GOD FORBID.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:55.660
IF FOR EXAMPLE, MARY
ADOPTED THEM AND SOMETHING

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:59.600
HAPPENED TO MARY, RATHER
THAN THE CHILDREN

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.560
AUTOMATICALLY COMING TO ME
THEY WOULD BE BACK IN THE

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.960
SOCIAL SERVICES SYSTEM AND
THEIR FUTURE WOULD BE JUST

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.260
AS UNCERTAIN AS IT WAS
WHEN THEY WERE WITH

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.500
THEIR PARENTS.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.360
AND WHAT THIS DOES IS IT
GUARANTEES THAT THEY WILL

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.730
BE PROTECTED.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:14.800
PEOPLE FORGET THAT.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.760
PEOPLE WITH ALL THESE
OTHER AGENDAS DON'T EVEN

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.530
CONSIDER WHAT WE'RE
GUARANTEEING FOR THE

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.430
CHILDREN BY DOING THIS.

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:25.360
>> VIOLA: IT'S BRINGING
SOMEONE INTO A LOVING

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.360
FAMILY THAT'S IMPORTANT.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.160
>> LESLEE: WE ARE
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:35.560
BECAUSE OF OUR
RELATIONSHIP.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.600
IT TIES YOUR
HANDS LEGALLY.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.330
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO
FIGURE OUT, OKAY NOW WE'RE

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.360
IN A GOOD SITUATION
BECAUSE HE'S 18 YEARS OLD.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.830
I MEAN, HE CAN GO TO A
JUDGE AND SAY "FOR THE

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.560
LAST 3 1/2 YEARS OF MY
LIFE I WANT TO HAVE THIS

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.560
PERSON" IF SOMETHING WERE
TO HAPPEN TO ME" I WANT TO

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.200
HAVE VI AS MY MOM
OR MY GUARDIAN." .

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.700
I'M GREAT FOR ADOPTION,
BUT WHAT IF HE WERE TWO OR

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:55.800
THREE?

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.700
AND THEN SOMEONE IN
YOUR FAMILY TRIED TO

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:04.760
TAKE HIM AWAY.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.330
IT WOULD BE BAD.

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.260
REALLY BAD.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:13.660
AND THEN FINANCIALLY,
SOCIAL SECURITY.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:14.730
SORRY.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:19.330
I'M IN GOOD SHAPE BECAUSE
I WORK FOR THE STATE.

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:22.230
AND AS YOU ALL KNOW, YOU
CAN DESIGNATE WHO GETS

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.730
YOUR BENEFITS.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:30.130
BUT IF VI DIES, NO
ONE GETS BENEFITS.

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:33.460
AND THAT CERTAINLY WOULD
BE NICE FOR SAM TO HAVE

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:36.630
SOME BENEFITS
FROM HIS MOM.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.430
<i>>> HOW HAS THIS CHANGED
THE LIVES OF THE PARENTS?</i>

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.800

FOR THEIR CHILDREN?</i>

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:47.960
NOT MAKE JUDGMENTS
ON OTHER PEOPLE.

>> WHAT MORE
COULD YOU ASK?

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:51.400
I MEAN, THAT'S
WHAT WE WOULD HOPE.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.760
HEALTHY, NICE KIDS.

THEM TO BE JUDGING THEM IF

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:55.930
THEY'RE BLACK OR THEY'RE
WHITE OR THEY'RE GAY OR

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:57.730
THEY'RE BROWN OR
THEY'RE SHORT.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:59.560

THINK THEY MISS OUT A LOT.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.260
LIKE I SAID, I CAN'T
REALLY IDENTIFY ANYTHING

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.500
THAT I THINK THEY WOULD BE
LACKING IN EXPERIENCING.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.000
>> WOULD IT BE
DISAPPOINTING IF ALL YOUR

CHILDREN TURNED
OUT STRAIGHT?

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.960

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.600
NOT AT ALL.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.830
WHO WOULD CHOOSE
THE GAY LIFESTYLE?

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:21.360
IT CAN BE A HARD LIFESTYLE
AS FAR AS.... YOU KNOW,

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.730
AGAIN, I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE
IN THE FAMILY SUPPORT AND

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.830
NOT LOSING THE
FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.830
BUT IT'S NOT A LIFESTYLE
THAT YOU'D WISH UPON

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.330
YOURSELF A LOT OF TIMES.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:31.860
SO IF THEY'RE
STRAIGHT, FINE.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:35.300
IF THEY'RE GAY,
I'LL BE THERE.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.300
>> I THINK SHE GETS SO
MUCH LOVE, IT'S AMAZING.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.130
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.830
I HAVE A VERY BUDDHIST
OUTLOOK ON IT.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:46.800
I MEAN, HOW SHE WOULD BE
RAISED IF I WERE STRAIGHT

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.900
AND HAPPILY MARRIED WOULD
BE DIFFERENT THAN IF I

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.200
WERE STRAIGHT AND
UNHAPPILY MARRIED, IF I

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.260
WERE A WORKING MOM
OR A SINGLE MOM OR A

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.160
STAY-AT-HOME MOM.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.700
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO
IMAGINE WHAT HER LIFE

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.600
WOULD BE LIKE IF I WERE
DIFFERENT AND THE WAY WE

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.460
HAVE CRAFTED OUR FAMILY
LIFE HAD BEEN DIFFERENT.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.060
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
SHE'S VERY LOVED.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:09.060
SHE HAS SO MANY PEOPLE
WHO ADORE HER, WHO ARE

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:13.330
TANGENTIALLY RELATED OR
BIOLOGICALLY RELATED OR

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:14.660
FAMILIARLY RELATED.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.430
I MEAN, TO ME IT'S LIKE
THE BEST OF ALL WORLDS IN

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:19.500
A CERTAIN WAY.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.830
>> ALLISON: SO IN A HUGE
WAY I FEEL SO LUCKY TO

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:24.700
HAVE IT COME UP THIS WAY.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:30.000
AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE
THAT FEELS SO LUCKY IS... I

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.300
VALUE MY KIDS AND MY FAMILY
AND PUTTING A LOT OF TIME

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.230
AND ENERGY INTO IT, AS
I THINK MANY PEOPLE DO.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:37.860
THEY HAVE THIS VISION OF
THEIR FAMILY THAT THEY

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.100
WANT IT TO BE.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.560
BUT I WOULD SAY THAT SO
MANY PEOPLE JUST CAN'T

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.700
DO IT ALL.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.460
YOU CAN'T ALSO KEEP YOUR
CAREER RUNNING AS GREAT AS

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.230
YOU WOULD LIKE IT
TO AND YOUR FAMILY.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.230
YOU KNOW THINGS JUST SLIP.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:52.330
OH I FORGOT TO HAVE THAT
CONVERSATION WITH ZIAN

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:53.830
TODAY, OR WHATEVER.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:56.030
BECAUSE THERE'S JUST
NOT ENOUGH TIME.

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:58.900
AND THE BIGGEST THING I'VE
REALLY FELT IS JUST WE

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.360
HAVE MORE TIME.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.160
LISA AND I GET TWO NIGHTS
A WEEK WHERE WE CAN BE

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.760
DOING OUR WORK OR FLEXING
OUR SCHEDULE OR DOING A

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.400
DATE NIGHT, AS
DO JEFF AND MARK.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.900
THEN ALL FOUR OF US HAVE
VERY THRIVING CAREERS.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.030
WHICH NOT TO SAY THAT
THAT'S, NOT JUST TO PUT

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:18.300
THE VALUE ON TO HAVE THAT
CAREER, BUT IT'S WHAT

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.430
WE'VE ALL WANTED TO DO.

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:23.000
SO WE'VE ALL REALLY BEEN
ABLE TO MAINTAIN CAREERS

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.330
AND PUT A LOT OF ENERGY
AND TIME INTO OUR FAMILY.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:29.400
>> COREEN: I MEAN I HAVE
THE SAME ISSUES THEY HAVE.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:33.330
JUST BECAUSE I CHOOSE TO
LOVE A WOMAN INSTEAD OF A

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:34.860
MAN DOESN'T MAKE ANY
DIFFERENCE HOW I FEEL

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.760
ABOUT MY CHILDREN.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.800
>> JOHN: WE WANT WHAT
EVERY PARENT WANTS.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:47.130
IT IS FOR HIM TO GROW UP
AND BECOME THE BEST MOST

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:50.260
WELL-ROUNDED PERSON
THAT HE CAN BECOME.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:56.000
AND AS FAR AS HAVING FEARS
ABOUT YOU KNOW, WHAT

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.260
SOCIETY IS GOING TO THINK
OR PRESSURES ON HIM BY

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:03.830
HAVING TWO DADS, I'VE
THOUGHT ALL ALONG I JUST

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:09.360
HOPE THAT WE DO A
GREAT JOB RAISING HIM.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:15.460
AND THAT HE'LL BE ABLE TO
HANDLE WHAT IS OUT THERE

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.430
FOR HIM.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:25.100
AND I THINK THAT EVERY
PARENT JUST WANTS

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:29.130
ABSOLUTELY THE BEST FOR
THEIR CHILD, AND THAT'S

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:30.360
WHAT WE WANT.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:35.160
AND WE KNOW, WE JUST KNOW
THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH TO

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.630
OFFER FOR HIM AND SO
MUCH LOVE FOR HIM.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:47.230
AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT
HE WILL BE THE INTELLIGENT

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:50.960
WELL-ROUNDED GIFTED YOUNG
MAN THAT WE THINK HE'S

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.300
GOING TO BE AND HE CAN
HANDLE ANYTHING THAT LIFE

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.630
THROWS AT HIM.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.760
>> DANIELLE: WE WERE
CERTAINLY BROUGHT TOGETHER

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.160
BY SOME GREAT FORCE.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.900
THERE'S JUST NO
DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.500
AND YOU KNOW, THAT'S
ANOTHER REALLY

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:04.860
IMPORTANT POINT.

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:09.000
YOU KNOW WHEN THEY WERE IN
THE ROOM AND CARTER WAS

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.460
BORN, YOU KNOW, WE JUST
LOOKED AT EACH OTHER

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:12.830
AND WE WERE CRYING
AND I WAS LIKE

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.100
"CONGRATULATIONS, DAD".

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.500
AND THEY'RE
"CONGRATULATIONS, MOM".

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.060
AND IT WAS UNREAL.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.560
YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:24.530
>> JOHN: AND I ALSO THINK
THAT SOCIETY IS CHANGING.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:33.260
AND THAT WHEN HE IS OLDER
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.260
MORE ACCEPTABLE.

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.630
IT'S CERTAINLY MORE
ACCEPTABLE NOW THAN

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.360
IT WAS 10, 15 YEARS AGO.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.100
AND I THINK IN ANOTHER 10
OR 15 YEARS WE'RE GOING TO

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.860
CONTINUE TO MAKE ADVANCES.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.260
<i>>> THE GRANDMOTHER OF THE
TRIPLET BOYS, COREEN'S</i>

AND GET OVER YOUR
PRECONCEIVED IDEAS.

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:03.360
IF I HAD DECIDED THAT
I WASN'T GOING TO HAVE

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.960
ANYTHING TO DO WITH COREEN
BECAUSE SHE WAS GAY OR IF

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.000
I HAD DECIDED I WASN'T
GOING TO HAVE ANYTHING TO

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.600
DO WITH THE CHILDREN, MY
LIFE WOULD BE A LOT LESS

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.260
FULL THAN WHAT IT IS.

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.560
I'D BE LACKING IN
A LOT OF AREAS.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.160
>> JEANNIE: THERE'S
NO SUCH THING AS AN

ACCIDENTAL PREGNANCY

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.260
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS
HAVING TO GET MARRIED AND

BEING FORCED TO
RAISE CHILDREN.

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:30.400
WE DO NOT HAVE
UNWANTED CHILDREN.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.400
