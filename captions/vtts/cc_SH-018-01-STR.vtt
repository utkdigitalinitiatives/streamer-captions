00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:42.470


2
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.770
(laughing)

3
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.130
If you shall chance, Camillo,

4
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.770
to visit Bohemia,

5
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.870
on the like occasion whereon my services

6
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.070
are now on foot,

7
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.230
you shall see, as I have said,

8
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.600
great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.

9
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.700
I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia

10
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.630
means to pay Bohemia the visitation

11
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.730
which he justly owes him.

12
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.630
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us

13
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.470
we will be justified in our loves; for indeed--

14
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.770
Beseech you,--

15
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.830
Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:

16
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.730
we cannot with such magnificence--

17
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.530
in so rare--I know not what to say.

18
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.730
We will give you sleepy drinks,

19
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.630
that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,

20
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.200
may, though they cannot praise us,

21
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.330
as little accuse us.

22
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.970
You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.

23
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.800
Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me

24
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.970
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.

25
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.270
Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.

26
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.230
They were trained together in their childhoods;

27
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.100
and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,

28
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.330
which cannot choose but branch now.

29
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.870
Since their more mature dignities

30
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.030
and royal necessities

31
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.200
made separation of their society, their encounters,

32
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.130
though not personal, have been royally attorneyed

33
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.000
with interchange of gifts, letters,

34
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.870
loving embassies; that they have seemed to be together,

35
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.070
though absent, shook hands, as over a vast,

36
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.200
and embraced, as it were,

37
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.730
from the ends of opposed winds.

38
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.930
The heavens continue their loves!

39
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.730
I think there is not in the world

40
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.570
either malice or matter to alter it.

41
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.970
You have an unspeakable comfort

42
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.730
of your young prince Mamillius:

43
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.900
it is a gentleman of the greatest promise

44
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.300
that ever came into my note.

45
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.670
I very well agree with you in the hopes of him:

46
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.230
it is a gallant child;

47
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.570
one that indeed physics the subject,

48
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.370
makes old hearts fresh:

49
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.370
they that went on crutches ere he was born

50
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.700
desire yet their life to see him a man.

51
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.170
Would they else be content to die?

52
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.200
Yes; if there were no other excuse

53
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.100
why they should desire to live.

54
00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.230
If the king had no son,

55
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.700
they would desire to live on crutches

56
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.100
till he had one.

57
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.200
Nine changes of the watery star hath been

58
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.470
The shepherd's note since we have left our throne

59
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.500
Without a burthen: time as long again my brother,

60
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.930
would be filled up with our thanks;

61
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.500
And yet we should, for perpetuity,

62
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.930
Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,

63
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.870
Yet standing in rich place,

64
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.000
I multiply with one 'We thank you'

65
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.370
many thousands more that go before it.

66
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.630
Stay your thanks a while;

67
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.170
And pay them when you part.

68
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.170
Sir, that's to-morrow.

69
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.830
I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance

70
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.000
Or breed upon our absence; that may blow

71
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.530
No sneaping winds at home, to make us say

72
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.800
'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd

73
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.370
To tire your royalty.

74
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.530
We are tougher, brother,

75
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.700
Than you can put us to't.

76
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.570
No longer stay.

77
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.530
One seven-night longer.

78
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.200
Very sooth, to-morrow.

79
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.870
We'll part the time between's then;

80
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.800
and in that I'll no gainsaying.

81
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.800
Press me not, beseech you, so.

82
00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.070
There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,

83
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.600
So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,

84
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.600
Were there necessity in your request,

85
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.930
'Twere needful I denied it.

86
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.500
My affairs do even drag me homeward:

87
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.300
which to hinder were in your love a whip to me;

88
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.270
my stay to you a charge and trouble:

89
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.300
to save both, farewell, our brother.

90
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.670
Tongue-tied, our queen? speak you.

91
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.230
I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until

92
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.470
You have drawn oaths from him not to stay.

93
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.030
You, sir, Charge him too coldly.

94
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.800
Tell him, you are sure All in Bohemia's well;

95
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.430
this satisfaction the by-gone day proclaim'd:

96
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.330
say this to him, he's beat from his best ward.

97
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.070
Well said, Hermione.

98
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.200
To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:

99
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.730
But let him say so then, and let him go;

100
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.600
But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,

101
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.830
We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.

102
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.800
Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure

103
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.700
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia

104
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.270
You take my lord, I'll give him my commission

105
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.370
To let him there a month behind the gest

106
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.230
Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,

107
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.000
I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind

108
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.170
What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?

109
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.630
No, madam.

110
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.870
Nay, but you will?

111
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.770
I may not, verily.

112
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.100
Verily!

113
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.000
You put me off with limber vows;

114
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.170
but I, Though you would seek to unsphere

115
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.430
the stars with oaths,

116
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.400
Should yet say 'Sir, no going.'

117
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.530
Verily, You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's

118
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.030
As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?

119
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.800
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,

120
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.430
Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees

121
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.100
When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?

122
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.430
My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'

123
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.870
One of them you shall be.

124
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.370
Your guest, then, madam:

125
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.400
To be your prisoner should import offending;

126
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.600
Which is for me less easy to commit

127
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.700
Than you to punish.

128
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.530
Not your gaoler, then,

129
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.430
But your kind hostess.

130
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.530
Come, I'll question you

131
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.070
Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:

132
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.130
You were pretty lordings then?

133
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.130
We were, fair queen,

134
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.500
Two lads that thought there was no more behind

135
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.630
But such a day to-morrow as to-day,

136
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.230
And to be boy eternal.

137
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.030
Was not my lord

138
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.870
The verier wag o' the two?

139
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.400
We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,

140
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.330
And bleat the one at the other:

141
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.000
what we changed

142
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.500
Was innocence for innocence;

143
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.630
we knew not

144
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.130
The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd that any did.

145
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.700
Had we pursued that life,

146
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.630
And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd

147
00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.870
With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven

148
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.270
Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd

149
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.630
Hereditary ours.

150
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.070
By this we gather

151
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.900
You have tripp'd since.

152
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.170
O my most sacred lady!

153
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.700
Temptations have since then been born to's;

154
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.470
for in those unfledged days was my wife a girl;

155
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.170
Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes

156
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.670
Of my young play-fellow.

157
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.800
Grace to boot!

158
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.800
Of this make no conclusion, lest you say

159
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.000
Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;

160
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.430
The offences we have made you do we'll answer,

161
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.930
If you first sinn'd with us and that with us

162
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.800
You did continue fault and that you slipp'd

163
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.570
not with any but with us.

164
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:42.770
Is he won yet?

165
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.770
He'll stay my lord.

166
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.700
At my request he would not.

167
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.700
Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest

168
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.300
To better purpose.

169
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:51.930
Never?

170
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.200
Never, but once.

171
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.900
What! have I twice said well? when was't before?

172
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.300
I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's

173
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:07.200
As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless

174
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.000
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.

175
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.230
Our praises are our wages: you may ride's

176
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.770
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere

177
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.800
With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:

178
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.800
My last good deed was to entreat his stay:

179
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.970
What was my first? it has an elder sister,

180
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.730
Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!

181
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.830
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?

182
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.300
Nay, let me have't; I long.

183
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.400
Why, that was when

184
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.170
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,

185
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.930
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand

186
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:50.300
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter

187
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.670
'I am yours for ever.'

188
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.670
'Tis grace indeed.

189
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:05.470
Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:

190
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.400
The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;

191
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.600
The other for some while a friend.

192
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.130
Too hot, too hot!

193
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.400
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.

194
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.400
I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;

195
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.930
But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment

196
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.170
May a free face put on, derive a liberty

197
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.500
From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,

198
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.130
And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;

199
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.530
But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,

200
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.570
As now they are, and making practised smiles,

201
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.500
As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere

202
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.070
The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment

203
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:06.400
My bosom likes not, nor my brows!

204
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.500
Mamillius, Art thou my boy?

205
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.430
Ay, my good lord.

206
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:13.930
I' fecks!

207
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.070
Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast

208
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.430
smutch'd thy nose?

209
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.470
They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,

210
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:28.730
We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:

211
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.400
And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf

212
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.430
Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling

213
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:39.930
Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!

214
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.170
Art thou my calf?

215
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.300
Yes, if you will, my lord.

216
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.300
Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,

217
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.070
To be full like me: yet they say we are

218
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.400
Almost as like as eggs; women say so,

219
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.800
That will say anything but were they false

220
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.570
As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false

221
00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.330
As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes

222
00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.400
No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true

223
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:06.830
To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,

224
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.830
Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!

225
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:15.200
Most dear'st! my collop!

226
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.300
Can thy dam?--may't be?--

227
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.930
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:

228
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.300
Thou dost make possible things not so held,

229
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:32.470
Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--

230
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.770
With what's unreal thou coactive art,

231
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.230
And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent

232
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.600
Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,

233
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.770
And that beyond commission, and I find it,

234
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.630
And that to the infection of my brains

235
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.300
And hardening of my brows.

236
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.600
What means Sicilia?

237
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.170
He something seems unsettled.

238
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:53.070
How, my lord!

239
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.630
What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?

240
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.570
You look as if you held a brow of much distraction

241
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.670
Are you moved, my lord?

242
00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.530
No, in good earnest.

243
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.400
How sometimes nature will betray its folly,

244
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.200
Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime

245
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.800
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines

246
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.530
Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil

247
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.770
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,

248
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.170
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,

249
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.070
Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,

250
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.070
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:

251
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.670
How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,

252
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:32.530
This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,

253
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.200
Will you take eggs for money?

254
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.030
No, my lord, I'll fight.

255
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:41.930
You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,

256
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.670
Are you so fond of your young prince

257
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.070
as we do seem to be of ours?

258
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.000
If at home, sir,

259
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.470
He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,

260
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.870
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,

261
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.670
My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:

262
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.500
He makes a July's day short as December,

263
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.770
And with his varying childness cures in me

264
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.830
Thoughts that would thick my blood.

265
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.500
So stands this squire

266
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.230
Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,

267
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.230
And leave you to your graver steps.

268
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:23.270
Hermione, How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;

269
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.830
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:

270
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.200
Next to thyself and my young rover,

271
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.100
he's apparent to my heart.

272
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.270
If you would seek us,

273
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.830
We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?

274
00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:35.600
To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,

275
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.570
Be you beneath the sky.

276
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.500
I am angling now,

277
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.300
Though you perceive me not how I give line.

278
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.370
Go to, go to!

279
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.830
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!

280
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.670
And arms her with the boldness of a wife

281
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.170
To her allowing husband!

282
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.230
Gone already!

283
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.630
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head

284
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.300
and ears a fork'd one!

285
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.930
Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays,

286
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.900
and I play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue

287
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.370
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour

288
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.930
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.

289
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:20.870
There have been,

290
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.200
Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;

291
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.670
And many a man there is, even at this present,

292
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.470
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,

293
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:29.830
That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence

294
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.800
And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour,

295
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.170
by Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't

296
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.230
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,

297
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.900
As mine, against their will. Should all despair

298
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.970
That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind

299
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.870
Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;

300
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
It is a bawdy planet, that will strike

301
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.830
Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,

302
00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:57.500
From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,

303
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.870
No barricado for a belly; know't;

304
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.170
It will let in and out the enemy

305
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.900
With bag and baggage: many thousand on's

306
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:12.170
Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!

307
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.400
I am like you, they say.

308
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.800
Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?

309
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.770
Ay, my good lord.

310
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.630
Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.

311
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:26.530
Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.

312
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.900
You had much ado to make his anchor hold:

313
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.070
When you cast out, it still came home.

314
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.300
Didst note it?

315
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.000
He would not stay at your petitions: made

316
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.670
His business more material.

317
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.200
Didst perceive it?

318
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.570
They're here with me already, whispering, rounding

319
00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.130
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,

320
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:51.470
When I shall gust it last.

321
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.070
How came't, Camillo, That he did stay?

322
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:55.730
At the good queen's entreaty.

323
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.170
At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent

324
00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:01.600
But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken

325
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.670
By any understanding pate but thine?

326
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.600
For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in

327
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.070
More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,

328
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.700
But of the finer natures? by some severals

329
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.700
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes

330
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.430
Perchance are to this business purblind? say.

331
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.400
Business, my lord! I think most understand

332
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.000
Bohemia stays here longer.

333
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Ha!

334
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.300
Stays here longer.

335
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.800
Ay, but why?

336
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.300
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties

337
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.630
Of our most gracious mistress.

338
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.770
Satisfy!

339
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:40.830
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!

340
00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:44.100
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,

341
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.030
With all the nearest things to my heart, as well

342
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.200
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou

343
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.930
Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed

344
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.000
Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been

345
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Deceived in thy integrity, deceived

346
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.970
In that which seems so.

347
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.300
Be it forbid, my lord!

348
00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.170
To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,

349
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.070
If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,

350
00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.030
Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining

351
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.500
From course required; or else thou must be counted

352
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.830
A servant grafted in my serious trust

353
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:11.500
And therein negligent; or else a fool

354
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.030
That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,

355
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.300
And takest it all for jest.

356
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.230
My gracious lord,

357
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.070
I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;

358
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.870
In every one of these no man is free,

359
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:22.770
But that his negligence, his folly, fear,

360
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.330
Among the infinite doings of the world,

361
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:27.470
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,

362
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:28.870
If ever I were wilful-negligent,

363
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.030
It was my folly; if industriously

364
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.830
I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,

365
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.900
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful

366
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.930
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,

367
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.900
Where of the execution did cry out

368
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.800
Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear

369
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.600
Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,

370
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.870
Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty

371
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.500
Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,

372
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.500
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass

373
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.330
By its own visage: if I then deny it,

374
00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.570
'Tis none of mine.

375
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.200
Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--

376
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.870
But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass

377
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.400
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--

378
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.000
For to a vision so apparent rumour

379
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.170
Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation

380
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.170
Resides not in that man that does not think,--

381
00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:16.270
My wife is slippery?

382
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.230
If thou wilt confess,

383
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.930
Or else be impudently negative,

384
00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.500
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say

385
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.330
My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name

386
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.230
As rank as any flax-wench that puts to

387
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.230
Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.

388
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:36.800
I would not be a stander-by to hear

389
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.730
My sovereign mistress clouded so, without

390
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.530
My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,

391
00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:44.330
You never spoke what did become you less

392
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.030
Than this; which to reiterate were sin

393
00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.500
As deep as that, though true.

394
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.270
Is whispering nothing?

395
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.470
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?

396
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.130
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career

397
00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.400
Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible

398
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.730
Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?

399
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.470
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?

400
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.000
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes

401
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.930
Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,

402
00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:15.130
That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?

403
00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.230
Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;

404
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.800
The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;

405
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.300
My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,

406
00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.470
If this be nothing.

407
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:24.530
Good my lord, be cured

408
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.130
Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;

409
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.500
For 'tis most dangerous.

410
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.630
Say it be, 'tis true.

411
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:30.970
No, no, my lord.

412
00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.800
It is; you lie, you lie:

413
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.200
I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,

414
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.930
Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,

415
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:40.170
Or else a hovering temporizer, that

416
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.100
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,

417
00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.600
Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver

418
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.330
Infected as her life, she would not live

419
00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:47.900
The running of one glass.

420
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.700
Who does infect her?

421
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.170
Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging

422
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:58.830
About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I

423
00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.230
Had servants true about me, that bare eyes

424
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.800
To see alike mine honour as their profits,

425
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.870
Their own particular thrifts, they would do that

426
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.830
Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,

427
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.100
His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form

428
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.870
Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see

429
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.630
Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,

430
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.670
How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,

431
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.830
To give mine enemy a lasting wink;

432
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.400
Which draught to me were cordial.

433
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.730
Sir, my lord,

434
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:37.230
I could do this, but I cannot

435
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.330
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,

436
00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.800
So sovereignly being honourable.

437
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.630
I have loved thee,--

438
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.470
Make that thy question, and go rot!

439
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.600
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,

440
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.300
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully

441
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.300
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,

442
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.670
Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted

443
00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.300
Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,

444
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.200
Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,

445
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.900
Who I do think is mine and love as mine,

446
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:11.170
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?

447
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:15.100
Could man so blench?

448
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.570
I must believe you, sir:

449
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:24.270
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;

450
00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.870
Provided that, when he's removed, your highness

451
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.470
Will take again your queen as yours at first,

452
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.870
Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing

453
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.830
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms

454
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.530
Known and allied to yours.

455
00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:37.670
Thou dost advise me

456
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.070
Even so as I mine own course have set down:

457
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.900
I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.

458
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.600
My lord,

459
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.770
Go then; and with a countenance as clear

460
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.100
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia

461
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.970
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:

462
00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.930
If from me he have wholesome beverage,

463
00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:03.700
Account me not your servant.

464
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.570
This is all:

465
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.730
Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;

466
00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:11.530
Do't not, thou split'st thine own.

467
00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.070
I'll do't, my lord.

468
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:17.400
I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.

469
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:32.700
O miserable lady! But, for me,

470
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.470
What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner

471
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.400
Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't

472
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.130
Is the obedience to a master, one

473
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:42.870
Who in rebellion with himself will have

474
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.600
All that are his so too. To do this deed,

475
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:51.430
Promotion follows. If I could find example

476
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.470
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings

477
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.900
And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since

478
00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.170
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,

479
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:06.430
Let villany itself forswear't. I must

480
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:10.500
Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain

481
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:17.000
To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!

482
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.730
Here comes Bohemia.

483
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.500
This is strange: methinks

484
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:28.570
My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?

485
00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:29.870
Good day, Camillo.

486
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.430
Hail, most royal sir!

487
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.000
What is the news i' the court?

488
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.370
None rare, my lord.

489
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.300
The king hath on him such a countenance

490
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.230
As he had lost some province and a region

491
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.470
Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him

492
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.970
With customary compliment; when he,

493
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.330
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling

494
00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:48.570
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me

495
00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.670
and so leaves me to consider what is breeding

496
00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.970
That changeth thus his manners.

497
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.600
I dare not know, my lord.

498
00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.530
How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?

499
00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.100
Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;

500
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.870
For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.

501
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:09.770
And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,

502
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.270
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror

503
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.470
Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be

504
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.300
A party in this alteration,

505
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.630
finding Myself thus alter'd with 't.

506
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.130
There is a sickness

507
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.770
Which puts some of us in distemper,

508
00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:29.770
but I cannot name the disease; and it is caught

509
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.230
Of you that yet are well.

510
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.900
How! caught of me!

511
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.630
Make me not sighted like the basilisk:

512
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.070
I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better

513
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.430
By my regard, but kill'd none so. -

514
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.670
I beseech you,

515
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.130
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge

516
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.030
Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not

517
00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.430
In ignorant concealment.

518
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.800
I may not answer.

519
00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:59.600
A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!

520
00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.330
I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,

521
00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:05.930
I conjure thee, by all the parts of man

522
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.230
Which honour does acknowledge,

523
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.230
whereof the least

524
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:12.630
Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare

525
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.900
What incidency thou dost guess of harm

526
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:23.530
Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;

527
00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.730
Which way to be prevented, if to be;

528
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:28.530
If not, how best to bear it.

529
00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.300
Sir, I will tell you;

530
00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.570
Since I am charged in honour and by him

531
00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:36.470
That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,

532
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.100
Which must be even as swiftly follow'd

533
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.330
as I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me

534
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.170
Cry lost, and so good night!

535
00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:44.000
On, good Camillo.

536
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.930
I am appointed him to murder you.

537
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:47.370
By whom?

538
00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:49.070
By the king.

539
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.070
For what?

540
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.730
He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,

541
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.600
As he had seen't or been an instrument

542
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.770
To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen

543
00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:57.700
Forbiddenly.

544
00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.830
O, then my best blood turn

545
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.470
To an infected jelly and my name

546
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:07.630
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!

547
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:09.200
Turn then my freshest reputation

548
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.770
to a savour that may strike the dullest nostril

549
00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:13.770
Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,

550
00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:16.930
Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection

551
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:18.100
That e'er was heard or read!

552
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:18.970
Swear his thought over

553
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:20.400
By each particular star in heaven and

554
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.870
By all their influences, you may as well

555
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.130
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon

556
00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.400
As or by oath remove or counsel shake

557
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.570
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation

558
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.900
Is piled upon his faith and will continue

559
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.800
The standing of his body.

560
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.670
How should this grow?

561
00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.270
I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer

562
00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.370
to avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.

563
00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:41.070
If therefore you dare trust my honesty,

564
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:42.930
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you

565
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:45.300
Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!

566
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.430
Your followers I will whisper to the business,

567
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.270
And will by twos and threes at several posterns

568
00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:52.830
Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put

569
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.930
My fortunes to your service, which are here

570
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:59.570
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;

571
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:00.900
For, by the honour of my parents,

572
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.070
I have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,

573
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.200
I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer

574
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.170
Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth,

575
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:08.800
thereon his execution sworn.

576
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.800
I do believe thee:

577
00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:19.530
I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:

578
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.330
Be pilot to me and thy places shall

579
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.870
Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready

580
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.630
and my people did expect my hence departure

581
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:30.100
Two days ago. This jealousy

582
00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.270
Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,

583
00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:34.530
Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,

584
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:38.730
Must it be violent, and as he does conceive

585
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.830
He is dishonour'd by a man which ever

586
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:45.500
Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must

587
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:50.300
In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:

588
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.470
Good expedition be my friend, and comfort

589
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:55.600
The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing

590
00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.100
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;

591
00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.630
I will respect thee as a father

592
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:07.600
if thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.

593
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.170
It is in mine authority to command

594
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.970
The keys of all the posterns: please your highness

595
00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.900
To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.

596
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.070
