WEBVTT

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
TWO SIMILAR CRIMES.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
TWO DEFENDANTS.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
ALL RISE.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
BEFORE THE SAME JUDGE.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH AN

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
OBVIOUS DISPARITY IN SENTENCING

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN BASED ON

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
RACE.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
TWO DIFFERENT SENTENCES.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
DON'T MAKE MY RED FLAG GO UP

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
WITH A DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATION

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
FOR A WHITE DEFENDANT.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
QUESTIONS OF FAIRNESS.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
DO YOU THINK THE JUDGE CALLED

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
YOU A RACIST OR CALLED YOUR AFS

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.000
RACIST?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
YES.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
DON'T TAKE CASE OUT OF 25,000

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
THAT WE DO EVERY YEAR, LOOK AT

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
JUST THE RACE OF THE DEFENDANTS

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
AND DRAW A CONCLUSION THAT THIS

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
WAS BASED ON RACE.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
THAT'S WRONG.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
TONIGHT, WE KNOW JUSTICE IS

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
SUPPOSED TO BE COLOR BLIND, BUT

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
IS IT?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
AMERICA IN BLACK AND WHITE.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
IF YOU REDUCE THIS ISSUE TO

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
ITS MOST ELEMENTARY LEVEL, IT

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
BOILS DOWN TO A SIMPLE QUESTION

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
WITH TWO POSSIBLE AND EQUALLY

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.000
NASTY ANSWERS.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
WHY IS IT THAT THE NUMBER OF

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
BLACK AND HISPANIC PEOPLE IN

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
PRISON IS OUT OF ALL PROPORTION

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
TO THEIR PERCENTAGE IN THE

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
OVERALL POPULATION?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
EITHER YOU WOULD HAVE TO

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
CONCLUDE THAT THEY COMMIT MORE

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
CRIMES THAN WHITES DO OR THERE

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
IS SOME QUIRK IN OUR LEGAL

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
SYSTEM THAT WORKS AGAINST PEOPLE

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
OF COLOR.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
IT MAY BE A FUNCTION OF WEALTH

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
AND POVERTY.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
RICH PEOPLE, CAN AFFORD BETTER

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
LAWYERS OR LAWYERS THAT WILL

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
SPEND MORE TIME CRAFTING A

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
DEFENSE.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
POOR DEFENDANTS, MEANWHILE, ARE

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
OFTEN DEPENDENT ON

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
COURT-APPOINTED LAWYERS WHO HAVE

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
TO HANDLE SO MANY CASES THAT

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
THEY CAN'T DEVOTE MUCH TIME TO

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
ANY OF THEM.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
THE ONLY THING THAT'S EVEN

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
RELATIVELY NEW ABOUT ANY OF THIS

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
IS MANDATORY SENTENCING.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
IT WAS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
THE SAME CRIME WOULD BE PUNISHED

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
WITH THE SAME SENTENCE, NO

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
MATTER WHO THE DEFENDANT IS.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
BUT MANDATORY SENTENCING MAY

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
LIMIT THE OPTIONS JUDGES HAVE.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
IT DOES NOT TIE THE HANDS OF

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.000
PROSECUTORS.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
PROSECUTORS CAN CHOOSE OR NOT

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
CHOOSE TO OFFER A PLEA BARGAIN

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
TO A DEFENDANT.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
AND THAT CAN DEPEND ON ANY

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
NUMBER OF VARIABLES, INCLUDING

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.000
RACE.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
THAT, AT LEAST, IS WHAT ONE

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
MASSACHUSETTS JUDGE DETERMINED

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
IN A COUPLE OF CASES THAT CAME

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
BEFORE HIM.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
HERE'S "NIGHTLINE" CORRESPONDENT

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
MICHELLE MARTIN.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
ARE YOU UNDER THE INFLUENCE

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
OF ALCOHOL OR DRUGS AT THIS

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
POINT?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Reporter: MAYBE IT'S

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
REMARKABLE IN ITSELF, THAT AMID

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
THE STEADY CASES PASSING THROUGH

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
THIS COURTROOM --

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
OPERATION OF A MOTORCYCLE,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
HAVING NO INSPECTION STICKER.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
BY CONCEALING MERCHANDISE.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Reporter: REPRESENTING EVERY

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
KIND OF MISSTEP AND MISERY.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
THAT ANY ONE CASE OR DEFENDANT

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
STOOD OUT.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
BUT LAST SUMMER, ONE DID.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
YES, COUNSEL.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Reporter: ACTUALLY, IT WAS

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
TWO.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
FIRST CAME BERTRAND LAMITIE.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
HE WAS ACCUSED OF SELLING CRACK

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
TO A POLICE INFORMANT.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
IN EXCHANGE FOR A GUILTY PLEA,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
PROSECUTORS WANTED HIM, A

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
FIRST-TIME OFFENDER, TO SPEND

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
SIX MONTHS OF A TWO-YEAR

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
SENTENCE IN JAIL.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I LOOKED AT THE RECORD.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I SAW HE HAD NO RECORD.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
PERSUADE THE DRAE NOT TO

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
RECOMMEND A COMMITTED SENTENCE.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
IT TOOK US ALMOST FOUR

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
HEARINGS FOR THE JUDGE TO

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
FINALLY ACCEPT IT.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
THE JUDGE KEPT COMING BACK TO

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
THE PROSECUTION SAYING, ISN'T

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
THERE SOMETHING WE CAN DO?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
THEY WOULD NOT BUDGE.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
THEY GAVE UP THE FIGHT AND I

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
SAID, OKAY, IT'S TIME FOR THE

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
DRUG DEALER TO GO TO JAIL.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
ON THE DAY THAT I SENTENCED HIM,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I HAD NO REMORSE ABOUT

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
SENTENCING HIM.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Reporter: UNTIL THE DAY THAT

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
HE BEGAN SERVING HIS SENTENCE,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
THE SAME DAY THAT THE JUDGE GOT

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
THE CASE OF JARED CEDRONE.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
POLICE SAY THEY SAW HIM TRYING

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
TO BUY PILLS AND SEARCHED HIM

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
AND FOUND COCAINE.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
PROSECUTORS ALSO OFFERED HIM A

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
DEAL ON A TWO-YEAR SENTENCE.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
THE D.A. MAKES HER

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.000
RECOMMENDATION.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
IT'S MORE PROBATION.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I SAID LET ME LOOK AT HIS

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.000
RECORD.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I LOOKED AT HIS RECORD AND I SAW

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
THREE ORE DRUG OFFENSES.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I SAW HIM STIFFEN UP A LITTLE

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
BIT AND HE INQUIRED OF THE

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
DISTRICT ATTORNEY, WHAT MAKES

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
THIS CASE DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
THAT CAME BEFORE ME YESTERDAY?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
IT WAS BECAUSE HE HAD POWDER

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
COCAINE IN HIS POSSESSION.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
HE WAS NOT OBSERVED SELLING THE

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
COCAINE.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I SAID THAT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Reporter: BECAUSE, AS

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
SINGLETON SAW IT, THE MAIN

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
IS THAT ONE IS BLACK, ONE IS

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.000
WHITE.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
IN A MOVE THAT ROCKED THE

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
COURTHOUSE, THE JUDGE ORDERED

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
THE D.A.'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE AND

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
EXPLANATION SAYING --

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
OBVIOUS DISPARITY IN SENTENCING

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN BASED ON

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
RACE.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I HAD NOT BEEN LOOKING FOR IT.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
IT JUST FELL IN MY LAP.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
DON'T TAKE TWO CASES OUT OF

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
45,000 THAT WE DEAL WITH EVERY

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
SINGLE YEAR, LOOK AT JUST THE

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
RACE OF THE DEFENDANTS AND DRAW

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
A CONCLUSION THAT THIS WAS BASED

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
ON RACE.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.000
THAT'S WRONG.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Reporter: MARTHA COAKLEY IS

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
THE MIDDLESEX DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
WE WANT BACK TO EACH

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
THESE CASES WERE HANDLED BY

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.000
DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
THEY LOOKED AT THEM BASED ON THE

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
WAY, THE FACTORS WE LOOK AT FOR

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Reporter: CHIEF AMONG THE

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
FACTORS, SAID COAKLEY IN HER

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
RESPONSE, IS THAT THE D.A.'S

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
OFFICE SAW LAMITIE AS A DEALER.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
AND WHILE CEDRONE HAD MULTIPLE

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
CRIMES, THAT CLEARLY AND ONLY

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
INDICATE USING STATUS.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
HOW DID YOU PERSUADE THE COURT

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
THAT HE REALLY WAS A USER AND

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.000
NEEDED TREATMENT?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I THINK THE COURT PERSONNEL

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
DID A LOT OF THE WORK FOR ME.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
HE HAD A PROBATION OFFICER WHO

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
SAW THAT WAS A YOUNG GUY WITH A

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
PROBLEM AND NEEDED TO ADDRESS

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
THE PROBLEM.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
HE ALSO HAD SUPPORTIVE PARENTS.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
THAT PLAYS A BIG ROLE.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
HIS PARENTS REALLY WANTED HIM TO

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
GET SOME TREATMENT.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Reporter: AND YOU ALSO ARGUE

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
THAT MR. LAMITIE SHOULD ALSO

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
HAVE BEEN VIEWED AS A USER AND

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.000
NOT A DEALER.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
WHY?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
THAT'S THE SITUATION.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
HE STARTED IN HIGH SCHOOL USING

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
ALCOHOL AND DRUGS.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
AND HE GOT AROUND INTO THE WRONG

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
CROWD.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
AND I THOUGHT HE SHOULD TAKE

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
ADVANTAGE OF A FIRST OFFENDERS

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.000
PROGRAM.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I WROTE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
THAT LETTER.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
THEY HAD THAT KNOWLEDGE WAY

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
BEFORE THIS PARTICULAR CASE CAME

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.000
TO PLEA BARGAIN.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Reporter: DO YOU THINK THEY

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
TOOK THAT INFORMATION INTO

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.000
ACCOUNT?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
THEY DISCOUNTED EVERY BIT OF

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.000
IT.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
WE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
EVIDENCE TO CONVICT THIS

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.000
INDIVIDUAL.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
THERE WAS NOTHING ON HIS RECORD

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
OR, INDEED, WHAT THE DEFENSE

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
COUNSEL SAID THAT WHAT HE REALLY

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
HAD WAS JUST A DRUG PROBLEM

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
RATHER THAN A DRUG-SELLING

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.000
PROBLEM.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Reporter: HE HAS A LETTER

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
WHERE HE SAYS THE GUY HAS A DRUG

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
AND ALCOHOL PROBLEM.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
ARE YOU SAYING HE DIDN'T DISCUSS

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
IT IN HIS ORAL COMMUNICATIONS OR

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
DIDN'T EMPHASIZE IT ENOUGH?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WAS

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
NOT A MAJOR FACTOR IN

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.000
NEGOTIATING A PLEA.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Reporter: IF I COULD ASK THIS

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
WITHOUT OFFENDING YOU, IS IT

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
POSSIBLE THAT THE OTHER

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
DEFENDANT HAD A BETTER LAWYER?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
THE SAME LAWYER WITH THE SAME

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
SET OF FACTS GOT A BETTER

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.000
OUTCOME.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
BECAUSE HE WAS A WHITE

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.000
LAWYER?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Reporter: I DON'T KNOW.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
THIS IS THE TYPE OF ARGUMENT

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
THAT MANY PEOPLE MAKE WHEN A

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
BLACK LAWYER REPRESENTS A BLACK

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.000
DEFENDANT.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
AND WE GET A RESULT LESS THAN A

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.000
WHITE LAWYER.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
WHAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
THAT, EVEN AS WE REPRESENT BLACK

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
DEFENDANTS, WE ARE REQUESTING

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
THAT JUSTICE BE DONE AND IT BE

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
EQUAL, REGARDLESS OF THE COLOR

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
OF THE LAWYER.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Reporter: DO YOU THINK YOU

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE SAME

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
RESULT IF YOU HAD A BLACK

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.000
CLIENT?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I LIKE TO THINK SO, YEAH.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I ADVOCATED HARD FOR HIM.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
WRAPPING UP THE CASES IN OTHER

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
COURTS.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
AND THE GOAL ALWAYS WAS TO GET

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
HIM INTO TREATMENT,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
COURT-ORDERED TREATMENT.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Reporter: IF CEDRONE WAS JUST

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
A USER, SAYS THE JUDGE, WHY HE

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
WAS CHARGED AS A SELLER?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
WHY DID THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
LET HIM, REQUIRE HIM, TO PLEAD

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
GUILTY TO POSSESSION WITH INTENT

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
TO DISTRIBUTE, IF THE DISTRICT

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE REALLY

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
BELIEVED THAT?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Reporter: AT LEAST THE JUDGE

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
DID NOT BELIEVE THAT.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
IN ANOTHER UNUSUAL STEP, HE

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
VACATED MR. LAMITIE'S SENTENCE,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
REKUZED HIMSELF OF THE CASE AND

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
CALLED FOR AN OUTSIDE STUDY OF

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
THE D.A.'S HANDLING OF NARCOTICS

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
CASES INVOLVING MINORITIES.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
IT'S WORTH TALKING ABOUT.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I HAVEN'T SAID THAT.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
BUT I NEED SOME PATTERN OR

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
EVIDENCE HERE THAT TELLS ME THAT

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I CAN DO.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Reporter: BUT MAYBE WHAT

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
ANGERED THE D.A. THE MOST WAS

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
WHAT SHE THOUGHT THE JUDGE WAS

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
REALLY SAYING.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
DO YOU THINK THE JUDGE CALLED

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.000
YOU A RACIST?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
YES.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Reporter: DO YOU THINK THAT'S

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.000
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
YES.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Reporter: WHY DO YOU THINK

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.000
THAT?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
THAT'S WHAT HIS ORDER SAYS.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Reporter: I DON'T BELIEVE I

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
SAW THAT IN THAT STATEMENT.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I HAVE IT HERE.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
WE CAN BOTH LOOK AT IT.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
HE BELIEVES THE ONLY DIFFERENCE

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
BETWEEN THESE TWO CASES WAS

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
RACE.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
THEN YOU HAVE TO DRAW -- THE

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
NEXT STEP IS TO CONCLUDE THAT IT

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
WAS A RACIST RECOMMENDATION.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT I

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
HAVE RUN INTO PEOPLE THAT I

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
COULD SAY -- I COULD PUT MY HAND

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
ON THEIR SHOULDER AND SAY, BOB,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
YOU ARE A RACIST.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I HAVEN'T RUN INTO THAT.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I CANNOT SAY THAT.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Reporter: SO, WHAT CAN YOU

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.000
SAY?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I CAN SAY THAT RACISM

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
PERMEATES THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
SYSTEM AND WE ALL NEED TO DO

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
BETTER IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
IT AND HOPEFULLY ROOT IT OUT.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Reporter: WHAT RESPONSE HAVE

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
YOU GOTTEN TO THE STANCE YOU'VE

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
TAKEN IN THIS CASE?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
IT'S BEEN OVERWHELMING

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
BETWEEN PEOPLE CALLING, PEOPLE

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
WRITING, JUDGES WHO CORNERED ME

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
IN THE HALLWAY OR DIFFERENT

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
COURTROOMS SAYING GREAT JOB,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
GLAD SOMEONE'S TAKING A STAND.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
IT NEEDED TO GO PUBLIC.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Reporter: PERHAPS NOT

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
SURPRISINGLY.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SEES VERY

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
DIFFERENTLY.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I DON'T SEE EVIDENCE TO

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.000
SUPPORT HIS CONCLUSION.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I DON'T SEE ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
COURTHOUSE WHO ALSO SEES WHAT WE

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
DO EVERY SINGLE DAY, SUPPORTING

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.000
HIS CONCLUSION.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Reporter: AS FOR MR. LAMITE,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
THE BLACK DEFENDANT, A SECOND

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
JUDGE TOOK THE CASE.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
LAMITE AR AGAIN PLEADED GUILTY

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
AND AGREED TO THE SAME SENTENCE.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
MR. CEDRONE, THE WHITE DEFENDANT

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
WHO RECEIVED NO JAIL TIME IS NOW

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
BEING SOUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
A PROBATION VIOLATION ON ONE OF

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
HIS PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
HOW WIDE SPLED ARE RACIAL

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
DISPARITIES IN THE COURTROOM?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
THAT IN PART TWO OF MICHELLE

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.000

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
BACK.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
THE UNEQUAL TREATMENT THAT

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
JUDGE SINGLETON BELIEVES EXISTED

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
IN HIS COURTROOM IS PART OF WHAT

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
SOME BELIEVE TO BE A WIDER

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
TREND.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
ONCE AGAIN, HERE'S "NIGHTLINE"

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
CORRESPONDENT MICHELLE MART REN.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
ALL RISE.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Reporter: AS IT HAPPENS,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
JUDGE SINGLETON IS NOT THE ONLY

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
ONE TO NOTICE WHAT APPEAR TO BE

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
SENTENCING.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
FIVE YEARS AGO, THIS IS WHAT

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
DISTRICT COURT JUDGE SYDNEY

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
HANLON SAW IN HER COURTROOM.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I SAW A CASE WITH A YOUNG

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
WHITE MAN WORKING A MINIMUM WAGE

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
JOB, CHARGED WITH SIMPLE

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
POSSESSION, POSSESSION ONLY OF

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
$375 WORTH OF MARIJUANA.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT, UNLESS

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
THERE WERE FACTORS I DIDN'T KNOW

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
ABOUT, SOMEONE FROM THE URBAN

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
COURT, THAT I WORK IN, SOMEONE

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
WHO LIVES IN THIS COMMUNITY, FOR

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
THE MOST PART, PEOPLE OF COLOR,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
WOULD HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
INTENT TO DISTRIBUTE.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Reporter: SO, JUDGE HANLON

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
ASKED RESEARCHERS FROM A LOCAL

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
UNIVERSITY TO COME TO HER

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
COURTHOUSE AND SEE IF HER HUNCH

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
WAS CORRECT.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
THE SMALL STUDY THEY DID RAISED

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
CONCERN THAT THE BOSTON POLICE

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
DEPARTMENT AND THE D.A.'S OFFICE

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
AGREED TO PARTAKE IN A WIDER

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
STUDY.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
BUT SOMETHING INVOLVING RACE IS

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
GOING ON AROUND THE COUNTRY.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
FOR EXAMPLE, THE MASSACHUSETTS

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
SENTENCING COMMISSION SURVEY OF

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
SENTENCING PRACTICES FOR THE

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
YEAR 2000 SHOWED THAT 63% OF

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
THOSE CONVICTED OF CRIMES WERE

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.000
WHITE.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
WHITES WERE HALF OF THOSE

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
CONVICTED OF DRUG OFFENSES.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO MINIMUM

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
SENTENCES, ONLY 20% OF THOSE

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
WERE WHITE AND 80% FOR BLACK OR

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.000
HISPANIC.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
THE IMPORTANT QUESTION IS WHY?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.000
STATISTICS MEAN.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
THEY CAN MEAN A LOT OF THINGS.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EITHER I OR

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
ANY OTHER D.A. HAS A RACIST

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
POLICY OF SENTENCING.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Reporter: DOES IT HAVE TO BE

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
THAT?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
DOES IT HAVE TO BE A RACIST

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
POLICY OR NO PROBLEM AT ALL?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.000
NO.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Reporter: IS THERE SOME

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
ALTERNATE EXPLANATION THAT MIGHT

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
BE OF INTEREST?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
SURE.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
AND I'D LOVE TO HEAR WHAT JUDGE

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
SINGLETON'S FOCUS ON THE PROBLEM

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
OR CONCERN OF WHAT IT IS.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Reporter: JUDGE SINGLETON

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
SUGGESTED THAT THE TREND TOWARD

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
MIGHT BE PART OF THE PROBLEM.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
IN MASSACHUSETTS, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
SELLING DRUGS WITHIN 1,000 FEET

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
OF A SCHOOL TRIGGERS A MANDATORY

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
SENTENCE.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
THERE MIGHT BE A SCHOOL ON EVERY

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
OTHER BLOCK.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
MANDATORY MINIMUMS WERE SUPPOSED

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
TO IMPART MORE FAIRNESS.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
AND WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY PUT

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
IT IN THE HANDS OF THE

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
PROSECUTORS.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Reporter: WITH A MANDATORY

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
SENTENCE HANGING OVER A

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
PROSECUTOR'S HEAD, PROSECUTORS

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
HAVE MORE REV REJ TO PROD A

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
DEFENDANT TOWARD A GUILTY PLEA.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
PROSECUTORS FROM ANY GOOD

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
REASONS DON'T CHARGE PEOPLE.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
THEY DECIDE SOMEBODY'S GOING TO

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
SCHOOL.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
SOMEBODY HAS NO RECORD.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
SOMEBODY IS COOPERATING WITH

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
THEM AND PROVIDING THEM

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
INFORMATION.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
ALL GOOD REASONS TO GIVE

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
SOMEBODY A BREAK.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
BUT THERE'S -- THEY'RE STILL

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
MAKING THE SAME KIND OF

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
DECISIONS THAT JUDGES MAKE, ONLY

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
THEY'RE MAKING THEM IN PRIVATE.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
WHEN I DO IT, IT'S ON A TAPE.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
I HAVE TO WRITE IT DOWN.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Reporter: OF COURSE, JUDGES

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
DON'T HAVE TO ACCEPT THE PLEA

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
AGREEMENTS OFFERED AND CAN HAVE

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
BIASES OF THEIR OWN.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
THERE'S ALWAYS A MERE YAD OF

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
FACTORS AS TO WHY PEOPLE GET

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
SENTENCED.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
I THINK IT IS TRUE THAT, YOU

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
KNOW, PEOPLE WHO ARE OF A HIGHER

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
ECONOMIC GROUP, AND THAT TENDS

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
TO BE WHITES RATHER THAN BLACKS,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
WILL COME IN WITH GOOD LAWYERS

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
AND GOOD REPRESENTATION AND A

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
STRONGER FAMILY STRUCTURE.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
THAT'S AN UNFAIR, PERHAPS,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
IMPACT.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE OF POVERTY.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF RACE.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
AND RACE IS INVOLVED IN THAT AND

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
IT GETS COMPLICATED.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Reporter: IT IS HARD TO TALK

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
ABOUT RACE.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
THAT'S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
THAT EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN THIS

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
DISCUSSION AGREED ON.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
I FIND THAT WHEN YOU TRY TO

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
SAY WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
RACIAL IMPLICATIONS ON THAT,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
THERE ARE MANY WHITE PEOPLE WHO

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
ARE OFFENDED AND THE DISCUSSION

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.000
STOPS.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Reporter: LAST WEEK, FIVE

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
MONTHS AFTER THE WAR OF WORDS

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
BEGAN, DISTRICT ATTORNEY MARTHA

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
COAKLEY AND JUDGE SINGLETON

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
FINALLY SAT DOWN TO HAVE THEIR

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.000
TALK.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
THIS IS MICHEL MARTIN, FOR

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
"NIGHTLINE" IN WASHINGTON.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
IS A COLOR BLIND JUSTICE

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
SYSTEM EVEN POSSIBLE?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS CHARLES

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
OGLETREE, PROFESSOR OF LAW AT

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
HARVARD UNIVERSITY.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
HE JOINS US TONIGHT FROM OUR

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
PORTLAND AFFILIATE, KATU.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
IS THIS, PROFESSOR OGLETREE, A

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
GOOD CASE TO MAKE THE POINT THAT

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
NEEDS TO BE MADE?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
IT'S A GREAT CASE, TED.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
CAR NELL WEST HAD A PHRASE IN A

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
BOOK CALLED "RACE MATTERS."

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
IT TELLS US THAT RACE DOES

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
MATTER.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
TWO PEOPLE ARE TREATED

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF RACE.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
YOU CAN DEBATE THE FACTS.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
DEBATE THE LAW, THE SIX.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
BUT IT BOILS DOWN TO

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN AND A WHITE

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
DEFENDANT FEEL AND THEIR LAWYERS

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
FEEL THEY WERE TREATED

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
DIFFERENTLY IN THE SAME JUSTICE

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
THE PROSECUTOR, AS YOU HEARD,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
DISAGREES VEHEMENTLY.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
SHE SAYS NOT SO AND HOW DO YOU

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
PROVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE IN

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
MANY CASES.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
BUT STUDY AFTER STUDY HAVE TOLD

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
US THAT STATE, FEDERAL, LOCAL

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
AND NATIONAL, THAT

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
DEFENDANTS ARE TREATED

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
DIFFERENTLY IN OUR CRIMINAL

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
IT'S LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
SENTENCING GUIDELINES ENACTED IN

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
THE 1980s, GIVING PROSECUTORS A

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
LOT OF DISCRETION IN DECIDING

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
WHO IS CHARGED WITH WHAT

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.000
OFFENSE.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
AND THAT HAS A BIG IMPACT ON THE

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
OVERREPRESENTATION OF

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.000
AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THE

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
WAS IT BETTER WHEN THE JUDGES

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
HAD THE DISCRETION AND THE

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
PROSECUTORS HAD LESS?

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
IT WAS BETTER AND WORSE.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
BETTER BECAUSE JUDGES COULD TAKE

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
INTO CONSIDERATION CERTAIN

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
ASPECTS OF A SUSPECT'S OR

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
DEFENDANT'S BACKGROUND AND USE

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
THAT AS MITIGATION TO LIGHTEN

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
THE SENTENCE.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
IT WAS WORSE BECAUSE JUDGES,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
LIKE ANY PERSON, WERE FALLIBLE.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
AND THEY COULD MAKE JUDGMENTS

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
THAT WERE WRONG.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
AND THEY COULD USE UNCONSCIOUS

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
RACISM TO SAY A PERSON FROM A

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
POOR FAMILY IS NOT GOING TO DO

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
WELL SO MAYBE PRISON WOULD DO

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
THEM WELL.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
SO, THE IDEA WAS TO IMPROVE THE

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.000
SYSTEM.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
BUT THE SENTENCING GUIDELINES

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
LED TO SUBSTANTIALLY MORE PEOPLE

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.000
IN PRISON.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
MORE THAN 2 MILLION IN AMERICA

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
TODAY.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
THOSE NUMBERS HAVE ACCELERATED.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE IN PRISON

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
NOW UNDER THE CLINTON WATCH THAN

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
THERE WERE UNDER BUSH'S WATCH OR

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
ANY OTHER PRESIDENT IN MODERN

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.000
TIMES.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
IT'S NOT WHETHER YOU'RE A

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT OR BLACK

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
OR WHITE OR RICH OR POOR.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
IT'S SIMPLY THAT WE HAVE BEEN

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
VERY TOUGH ON CRIME.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
WE HAVE BEEN RELENTLESS IN

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
PURSUING PEOPLE, EVEN NONVIOLENT

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
DRUG OFFENDERS AND OUR JAILS ARE

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
OVERFLOWING.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
IT'S A PROBLEM THAT HAS TO HAVE

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
A LEGISLATIVE AND POLITICAL

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
SOLUTION.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
IF YOU SAY IT'S NOT

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
IDEOLOGICAL AND SURELY OF THE

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
MANY CRITICISMS THAT MAY HAVE

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
BEEN AND CAN BE DIRECTED AGAINST

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
PRESIDENT CLINTON, EVEN A

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
SUGGESTION OF RACISM HAS NEVER

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
BEEN AMONG THEM.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
WHY WOULD THAT BE THE CASE THEN?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
BECAUSE, WHEN YOU PRESIDE

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
OVER THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
AS THE CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
OFFICIAL IN THE FEDERAL LEVEL,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
AND YOU ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
CONGRESSIONAL POLICIES THAT ARE

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
MORE EMOTIONAL THAN REFLECTIVE

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
OF A THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS AND

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
DEBATE AND DISCUSSION, YOU END

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
UP WITH PEOPLE BEING SENT TO

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
JAIL FOR OFFENSES THAT DO NOT

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.000
REQUIRE JAIL.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
A LOT OF PEOPLE WENT TO JAIL FOR

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
CRACK COCAINE IN 1980.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
THEY COME OUT WITH NO EDUCATION.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
NO FAMILY.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
NO EMPLOYMENT SKILLS.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.000
NO HOPE.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
AND WE EXPECT THEM NOT TO THE --

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
IT'S NOT FIXING THE SYSTEM.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
I'M SAYING WHAT CAN YOU POINT

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
TO THAT DEMONSTRATES BEYOND ANY

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT THE

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
SYSTEM IS INTENTIONALLY OR

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
OTHERWISE RACIST.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
THIS IS THE CLASSIC CASE.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
FIRST OF ALL, CRACK COCAINE AND

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
POWDER COCAINE ARE BOTH COCAINE.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
AND YET, BECAUSE OF THE REACTION

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
TO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE EARLY

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
1980s, WITH THE SPREAD OF CRACK

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
COCAINE, IN URBAN AREAS, WE CAME

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
UP WITH PENALTIES TO MAKE THOSE

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
WHO HAD CRACK COCAINE FACE

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
PENALTIES THAT WERE 100-TIMES AS

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
SEVERE OF THOSE WITH POWDER

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
COCAINE.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
SAME DRUG.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
SAME CIRCUMSTANCES, PENALTIES

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.000
MASSIVELY KIMPBT.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
AND MANY OF THE

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO ARE

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
INCARCERATED TODAY FROM THE

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
1980s ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE USING

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
CRACK COCAINE, EVEN THOUGH THE

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
VAST MAJORITY OF COCAINE USERS

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
WERE WHITE AND THE PENALTIES

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
WERE NOT THE SAME.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
THE PENALTIES ARE DIFFERENT.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
THEY HAVE A RACIAL IMPACT.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
WE'RE DOWN TO OUR LAST FEW

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
SECONDS.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
LET ME REPOSE THE QUESTION I

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
POSED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.000
BROADCAST.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
AND SOME SAY MAY MORE BLACKS ARE

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
IN JAIL THAN WHITES BECAUSE MORE

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.000
BLACKS CHIT CRIME.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
MOST CRIME AND DRUG USE IS BY

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:11.000
WHITES.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
BLACKS ARE TARGETED BECAUSE

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
THEY'RE IN URBAN AREAS.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
THEY'RE IN AN OPEN MARKET.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
WE'RE NOT SEARCHING THE LOCKERS

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
WE'RE NOT SEARCHING THE

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
PENTHOUSES ON WALL STREET.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
DRUG ABUSE IS PERVASIVE, WITHOUT

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
REGARD TO RACE.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
BUT THE DEPLOYMENT OF POLICE

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
OFFICERS IS FOCUS ON THE URBAN

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.000
COMMUNITIES.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
I'M NOT SAYING WE TOLERATE IT OR

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
IT SHOULD BE CONDONED I'M SAYING

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
LET'S BE FAIR AND EQUAL.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
EQUAL JUSTICE IS WHAT WE ASK

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:39.000
FOR.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
IF WE HAVE THAT, THERE'S NO

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
REASON TO COMPLAIN.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
AND THAT'S OUR REPORT FOR

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
TONIGHT.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
I'M TED KOPPEL IN WASHINGTON.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.000
I'M TED KOPPEL IN WASHINGTON.
