00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.300
When you sally upon him,speak what terrible language you will

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.170
though you understand itnot yourselves, no matter;

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.630
for we must not seem tounderstand him,

5
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.700
unless some one among us

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.570
whom we must produce foran interpreter.

7
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.470
Good captain, let me bethe interpreter.

8
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.130
Art not acquainted with him?knows he not thy voice?

9
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.770
No, sir, I warrant you.

10
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.770
But what linsey-woolsey hastthou to speak to us again?

11
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.070
E'en such as you speakto me.

12
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.670
He must think us some bandof strangers

13
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.430
i' the adversary'sentertainment.

14
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.530
Now he hath a smack of allneighbouring languages;

15
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.500
therefore we must every onebe a man of his own fancy,

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.200
not to know what we speakone to another;

17
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.070
that we seem to know, is toknow straight our purpose:

18
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:54.430
choughs' language, gabbleenough, and good enough.

19
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.330
As for you, interpreter,you must seem very politic.

20
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.400
But couch, ho!

21
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.230
here he comes,

22
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.030
to beguile two hours in asleep,

23
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.570
and then to return andswear the lies he forges.

24
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.300
Ten o'clock: within thesethree hours

25
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.530
'twill be time enough togo home.

26
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.600
What shall I say I havedone?

27
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.030
It must be a very plausiveinvention that carries it:

28
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.600
they begin to smoke me;

29
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.630
and disgraces have of lateknocked too often at my door.

30
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.230
I find my tongue is toofoolhardy;

31
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.230
but my heart hath the fearof Mars before it

32
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.670
not daring the reports ofmy tongue.

33
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.600
This is the first truth

34
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.870
that e'er thine own tonguewas guilty of.

35
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.300
What the devil should moveme to undertake

36
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.900
the recovery of this drum,

37
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.870
being not ignorant of theimpossibility,

38
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.870
and knowing I had no suchpurpose?

39
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.100
Is it possible he shouldknow what he is,

40
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.200
and be that he is?

41
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.870
I would I had any drum ofthe enemy's:

42
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.800
I would swearI recovered it.

43
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.300
You shall hear one anon.

44
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.670
(drummng sounds)

45
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.430
A drum now of theenemy's,--

46
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.930
Throca movousus, cargo,cargo, cargo.

47
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.300
Boskos thromuldo boskos.

48
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.130
I know you are the Muskos'regiment:

49
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.370
And I shall lose my lifefor want of language;

50
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.400
If there be here German,or Dane, low Dutch,

51
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.300
Italian, or French, lethim speak to me;

52
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.670
I'll discover that whichshall undo the Florentine.

53
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.500
Boskos vauvado:

54
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.100
I understand thee, and canspeak thy tongue.

55
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.870
Kerely bonto,

56
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.730
Manka revania dulche.

57
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.200
Oscorbidulchos volivorco.

58
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.070
The general is content tospare thee yet;

59
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.000
And, hoodwink'd as thouart, will lead thee on

60
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.100
To gather from thee: haplythou mayst inform

61
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.900
Something to save thylife.

62
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.970
O, let me live!

63
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.000
And all the secrets of ourcamp I'll show,

64
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.370
Their force, theirpurposes; nay,

65
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.900
I'll speak that which youwill wonder at.

66
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.100
They told me that yourname was Fontibell.

67
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.070
No, my good lord, Diana.

68
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.230
Titled goddess;

69
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.770
And worth it, withaddition!

70
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.870
But, fair soul,

71
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.970
In your fine frame hathlove no quality?

72
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.200
If quick fire of youthlight not your mind,

73
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.330
You are no maiden, but amonument:

74
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.200
When you are dead,

75
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.730
you should be such a oneas you are now,

76
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.930
for you are cold and stem;

77
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.300
And now you should be asyour mother was

78
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.470
When your sweet selfwas got.

79
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.730
She then was honest.

80
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.800
So should you be.

81
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.000
No:

82
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.570
My mother did but duty;such, my lord,

83
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.500
As you owe to your wife.

84
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.670
No more o' that;

85
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.170
I prithee, do not striveagainst my vows:

86
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.600
I was compell'd to her;

87
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.570
but I love thee by love'sown sweet constraint,

88
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.670
and will for ever do theeall rights of service.

89
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.330
Ay, so you serve us tillwe serve you;

90
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.630
but when you have ourroses,

91
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.230
You barely leave ourthorns to prick ourselves

92
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.000
And mock us with ourbareness.

93
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.300
How have I sworn!

94
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.430
'Tis not the many oathsthat makes the truth,

95
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.600
But the plain single vowthat is vow'd true.

96
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.600
What is not holy, that weswear not by,

97
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.470
But take the High'st towitness:

98
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.100
then, pray you,tell me,

99
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.730
If I should swear by God'sgreat attributes,

100
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.030
I loved you dearly, wouldyou believe my oaths,

101
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.270
When I did love you ill?This has no holding,

102
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.430
To swear by him whom Iprotest to love,

103
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.300
That I will work againsthim: therefore your oaths

104
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.300
Are words and poorconditions, but unseal'd,

105
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.930
At least in my opinion.

106
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.370
Change it, change it;

107
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.470
Be not so holy-cruel: loveis holy;

108
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.130
And my integrity ne'erknew the crafts

109
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.130
that you do chargemen with.

110
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.670
Stand no more off,

111
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.300
But give thyself unto mysick desires,

112
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.070
Who then recover: say thouart mine,

113
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.900
and ever my love as itbegins shall so persever.

114
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.470
I see that men make ropesin such a scarre

115
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.470
That we'll forsakeourselves.

116
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.030
Give me that ring.

117
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.070
I'll lend it thee, mydear;

118
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.170
but have no power to giveit from me.

119
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.300
Will you not, my lord?

120
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.830
It is an honour 'longingto our house,

121
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.170
Bequeathed down from manyancestors;

122
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.900
Which were the greatestobloquy i' the world

123
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.030
In me to lose.

124
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.300
Mine honour's such a ring:

125
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.470
My chastity's the jewel ofour house,

126
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.630
Bequeathed down from manyancestors;

127
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.600
Which were the greatestobloquy i' the world

128
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.170
In me to lose: thus yourown proper wisdom

129
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.070
Brings in the championHonour on my part,

130
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.570
Against your vain assault.

131
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.200
Here, take my ring:

132
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:47.700
My house, mine honour,yea, my life, be thine,

133
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.230
And I'll be bid by thee.

134
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.470
When midnight comes, knockat my chamber-window:

135
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.870
I'll order take my mothershall not hear.

136
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.430
Now will I charge you inthe band of truth,

137
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.370
When you have conquer'd myyet maiden bed,

138
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.670
Remain there but an hour,nor speak to me:

139
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.970
My reasons are most strong;and you shall know them

140
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.000
When back again this ringshall be deliver'd:

141
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.770
And on your finger in thenight

142
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:25.670
I'll put a nother ring,that what in time proceeds

143
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.100
May token to the futureour past deeds.

144
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.270
Adieu, till then; then,fail not.

145
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.400
You have won a wife of me,

146
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.270
though there my hope bedone.

147
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.370
A heaven on earth I havewon by wooing thee.

148
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.400
For which live long tothank both heaven and me!

149
00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.800
You may so in the end.

150
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.700
My mother told me just howhe would woo,

151
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.470
As if she sat in 's heart;she says all men

152
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.330
Have the like oaths:

153
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.130
he had sworn to marry mewhen his wife's dead;

154
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.070
Therefore I'll lie withhim when I am buried.

155
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:31.130
Since Frenchmen are sobraid,

156
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:36.430
Marry that will, I liveand die a maid:

157
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.870
Only in this disguise Ithink't no sin

158
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.930
To cozen him that wouldunjustly win.

159
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.330
You have not given him hismother's letter?

160
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.470
I have delivered it anhour since:

161
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.630
there is something in'tthat stings his nature;

162
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.370
for on the reading it hechanged almost intoanother man.

163
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.670
He has much worthy blamelaid upon him

164
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.670
for shaking off so good awife and so sweet a lady.

165
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.430
Especially he hathincurred

166
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.270
the everlastingdispleasure of the king,

167
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.230
who had even tuned his bountyto sing happiness to him.

168
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.030
I will tell you a thing,

169
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.130
but you shall let it dwelldarkly with you.

170
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.730
When you have spoken it,'tis dead,

171
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.070
and I am the grave of it.

172
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.600
He hath perverted a younggentlewoman here in Florence,

173
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.930
of a most chaste renown;

174
00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.500
and this night he flesheshis will

175
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.100
in the spoil of herhonour:

176
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.730
he hath given her hismonumental ring,

177
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.270
and thinks himself made inthe unchaste composition.

178
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:41.130
Now, God delay ourrebellion!

179
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.570
as we are ourselves, whatthings are we!

180
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.500
Merely our own traitors.

181
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.470
And as in the commoncourse of all treasons,

182
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.270
we still see them revealthemselves,

183
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.930
till they attain to theirabhorred ends,

184
00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.570
so he that in this actioncontrives

185
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.030
against his own nobility,

186
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.270
in his proper streamo'erflows himself.

187
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.900
Is it not meant damnablein us,

188
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.770
to be trumpeters of ourunlawful intents?

189
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.830
We shall not then have hiscompany to-night?

190
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:12.500
Not till after midnight; forhe is dieted to his hour.

191
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.030
That approaches apace;

192
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.600
I would gladly have him seehis company anatomized,

193
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.900
that he might take a measureof his own judgments,

194
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.400
wherein so curiously hehad set this counterfeit.

195
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.370
We will not meddle withhim till he come;

196
00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.100
for his presence must bethe whip of the other.

197
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.600
In the mean time, whathear you of these wars?

198
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.430
I hear there is anoverture of peace.

199
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.300
Nay, I assure you, a peaceconcluded.

200
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.630
What will Count Rousillondo then?

201
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.870
will he travel higher, orreturn again into France?

202
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.230
I perceive, by thisdemand,

203
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.700
you are not altogether ofhis council.

204
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:51.900
Let it be forbid, sir;

205
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.730
so should I be a greatdeal of his act.

206
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.770
Sir, his wife some two monthssince fled from his house:

207
00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.300
her pretence is a pilgrimageto Saint Jaques le Grand;

208
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.330
which holy undertaking

209
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.730
with most austere sanctimonyshe accomplished;

210
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.000
and, there residing thetenderness of her nature

211
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.070
became as a prey to hergrief;

212
00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.300
in fine, made a groan ofher last breath,

213
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.430
and now she sings inheaven.

214
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:17.570
How is this justified?

215
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.230
The stronger part of it byher own letters,

216
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:20.330
which makes her storytrue,

217
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.630
even to the point of herdeath: her death itself,

218
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.500
which could not be heroffice to say is come,

219
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.070
was faithfully confirmed bythe rector of the place.

220
00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:29.530
Hath the count all thisintelligence?

221
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.370
Ay, and the particularconfirmations,

222
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:35.330
point from point, so to thefull arming of the verity.

223
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.600
I am heartily sorry thathe'll be glad of this.

224
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.630
How mightily sometimes we makeus comforts of our losses!

225
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.000
And how mightily someother times

226
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.030
we drown our gain intears!

227
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.330
The great dignity that hisvalour hath here acquiredfor him

228
00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.070
shall at home be encounteredwith a shame as ample.

229
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.470
The web of our life is ofa mingled yarn,

230
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.700
good and ill together:

231
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:02.800
our virtues would beproud,

232
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.930
if our faults whipped themnot;

233
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.300
and our crimes woulddespair,

234
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.500
if they were not cherishedby our virtues.

235
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:19.430
How now my lord ! it'snot after midnight?

236
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.730
I have to-night dispatchedsixteen businesses,

237
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.130
a month's length a-piece,

238
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.400
I have congied with theduke,

239
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.000
done my adieu with hisnearest;

240
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.070
buried a wife, mournedfor her;

241
00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.770
writ to my lady mother Iam returning;

242
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.900
entertained my convoy;

243
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.400
and between these mainparcels of dispatch

244
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.530
effected many nicer needs;

245
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.070
the last was the greatest,

246
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.700
but that I have not endedyet.

247
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.600
If the business be of anydifficulty,

248
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.300
and this morning yourdeparture hence,

249
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.370
it requires haste of yourlordship.

250
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.930
I mean, the business isnot ended,

251
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.700
as fearing to hear of ithereafter.

252
00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.200
But shall we have thisdialogue

253
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.230
between the fool and thesoldier?

254
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.170
Come, bring forth thiscounterfeit module,

255
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.600
he has deceived me, like adouble-meaning prophesier.

256
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.200
Bring him forth:

257
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.330
has sat i' the stocks allnight, poor gallant knave.

258
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.830
No matter: his heels havedeserved it,

259
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.100
in usurping his spurs solong.

260
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.270
How does he carry himself?

261
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.530
I have told your lordshipalready,

262
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.730
the stocks carry him.

263
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.800
But to answer you as youwould be understood;

264
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.800
he weeps like a wench thathad shed her milk:

265
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.930
he hath confessed himselfto Morgan,

266
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.030
whom he supposes to be afriar,

267
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.430
from the time of hisremembrance

268
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:36.270
to this very instantdisaster of his setting i'the stocks:

269
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.470
and what think you he hathconfessed?

270
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.370
Nothing of me, has a'?

271
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:41.600
His confession is taken,

272
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.370
and it shall be read tohis face:

273
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.530
if your lordship be in't,as I believe you are,

274
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.000
you must have the patienceto hear it.

275
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:52.030
A plague upon him!muffled! he can saynothing of me:

276
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.830
hush, hush!

277
00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:55.330
Hoodman comes!

278
00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.300
Portotartarosa

279
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.930
He calls for the tortures:

280
00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:02.970
what will you say without'em?

281
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.700
I will confess what I knowwithout constraint:

282
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.270
if ye pinch me like apasty, I can say no more.

283
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:12.500
Bosko chimurcho.

284
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.870
Boblibindo chicurmurco.

285
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.070
You are a mercifulgeneral.

286
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.000
Our general bids youanswer

287
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.830
to what I shall ask youout of a note.

288
00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.030
And truly, as I hopeto live.

289
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:29.900
First demand of him how manyhorse the duke is strong.'

290
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.330
What say you to that?

291
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.900
Five or six thousand; butvery weak and unserviceable:

292
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.100
the troops are allscattered,

293
00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.530
and the commanders verypoor rogues,

294
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.170
upon my reputation and creditand as I hope to live.

295
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.370
Shall I set down youranswer so?

296
00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.530
Do: I'll take thesacrament on't,

297
00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:45.200
how and which wayyou will.

298
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.600
All's one to him. What apast-saving slave is this!

299
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.570
You're deceived, my lord:this is Monsieur Parolles,

300
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:55.430
the gallant militarist,--thatwas his own phrase,

301
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.500
that had the whole theoric ofwar in the knot of his scarf,

302
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.330
and the practise in thechape of his dagger.

303
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.730
I will never trust a managain

304
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.130
for keeping hissword clean.

305
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:03.670
nor believe he can haveevery thing in him

306
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.630
by wearing his apparelneatly.

307
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.500
Well, that's set down.

308
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.030
Five or six thousandhorse, I said

309
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.400
I will say true,orthereabouts,

310
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.200
set down, for I'll speaktruth.

311
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.000
He's very near the truthin this.

312
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.400
But I con him no thanksfor't,

313
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.730
in the nature he deliversit.

314
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.070
'Demand of him, of whatstrength they are a-foot.'

315
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:21.900
What say you to that?

316
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.130
By my troth, sir,

317
00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.130
if I were to live thispresent hour, I will telltrue.

318
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.370
Let me see: Spurio, ahundred and fifty;

319
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.700
Sebastian, so many;Corambus, so many; Jaques,so many;

320
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.500
Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,and Gratii,

321
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.570
two hundred and fiftyeach;

322
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.030
mine own company,Chitopher, Vaumond,Bentii,

323
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.130
two hundred and fiftyeach: so that themuster-file,

324
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.530
rotten and sound, upon mylife,

325
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.070
amounts not to fifteenthousand poll;

326
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.030
half of the which dare notshake snow

327
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.000
from off their cassocks,

328
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.870
lest they shake themselvesto pieces.

329
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.870
What shall be done to him?

330
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.830
Nothing, but let him havethanks.

331
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:57.570
Bollybingo agranoche

332
00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.500
Demand of him mycondition,

333
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:04.630
and what credit I havewith the duke.

334
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:06.430
Well, that's set down.

335
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:07.370
'You shall demand of him,

336
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.970
whether one Captain Dumainbe i' the camp,

337
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.630
a Frenchman; what hisreputation is with theduke;

338
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.070
what his valour, honesty,and expertness in wars;

339
00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:17.970
or whether he thinks itwere not possible,

340
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.130
with well-weighing sums ofgold,

341
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.400
to corrupt him to revolt.'

342
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.800
What say you to this? whatdo you know of it?

343
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.930
I beseech you,

344
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.830
let me answer to the particularof the inter'gatories:

345
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:29.170
demand them singly.

346
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.400
Do you know this CaptainDumain?

347
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.670
I know him: a' was abotcher's 'prentice in Paris,

348
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:38.600
from whence he was whipped

349
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.600
for getting the shrieve'sfool with child,

350
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.130
a dumb innocent, thatcould not say him nay.

351
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:47.130
Nay, stay! Hold yourhands, by your leave,

352
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.000
Though I know his brains

353
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.370
are forfeit to the nexttile that falls.

354
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:54.030
Well, is this captain in theduke of Florence's camp?

355
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:58.530
Upon my knowledge, he is,and lousy.

356
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.130
Nay look not so upon me;we shall hear of yourlordship anon.

357
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.270
What is his reputationwith the duke?

358
00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:09.500
The duke knows him for noother but a poor officerof mine;

359
00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.130
and writ to me this other dayto turn him out o' the band:

360
00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.100
I think I have his letterin my pocket.

361
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.270
Marry, we'll search.

362
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.230
In good sadness, I do notknow; either it is there,

363
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.270
or it is upon a file

364
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.300
with the duke's other lettersin my tent.

365
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.830
Here 'tis; here's a paper:shall I read it to you?

366
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:27.130
I do not know if it be itor no.

367
00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.600
Our interpreter does itwell.

368
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.370
Excellently.

369
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:34.470
'Dian, the count's a fool,and full of gold,'--

370
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.130
That is not the duke'sletter, sir;

371
00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.370
that is an advertisement toa proper maid in Florence,

372
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:39.500
one Diana,

373
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.730
to take heed of the allurementof one Count Rousillon,

374
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.470
a foolish idle boy, butfor all that very ruttish:

375
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:45.870
I pray you, sir, put it upagain.

376
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.430
Nay, I'll read it first,by your favour.

377
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.570
My meaning in't,

378
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.030
I protest, was very honestin the behalf of the maid;

379
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.000
for I knew the young count

380
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.630
to be a dangerous andlascivious boy,

381
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:53.800
who is a whale tovirginity

382
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.230
and devours up all the fryit finds.

383
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.470
Damnable both-sides rogue!

384
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:03.000
'When he swears oaths, bidhim drop gold, and take it;

385
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.230
After he scores, he neverpays the score:

386
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:11.600
Half won is match well made;match, and well make it;

387
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.030
He ne'er pays after-debts,take it before;

388
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.670
And say a soldier, Dian,told thee this,

389
00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:24.130
Men are to mell with, boysare not to kiss:

390
00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.530
For count of this, thecount's a fool, I know it,

391
00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:29.500
Who pays before, but notwhen he does owe it.

392
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:36.800
Thine, as he vowed to theein thine ear, Parolles.'

393
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.970
He shall be whippedthrough the army

394
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.470
with this rhyme in'sforehead.

395
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.470
This is your devotedfriend, sir,

396
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.700
the manifold linguist andthe armipotent soldier.

397
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.500
I could endure any thingbefore but a cat,

398
00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.570
and now he's a cat to me.

399
00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:56.930
I perceive, sir, by thegeneral's looks,

400
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.970
we shall be fain to hangyou.

401
00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:03.700
My life, sir, in any case:not that I am afraid to die;

402
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.530
but that, my offencesbeing many,

403
00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:08.170
I would repent out theremainder of nature:

404
00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.400
let me live, sir, in adungeon,

405
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.830
i' the stocks, or anywhere,

406
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.800
so I may live.

407
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.400
We'll see what may be done,so you confess freely;

408
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.800
therefore, once more tothis Captain Dumain:

409
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.170
what is his honesty?

410
00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.270
he will lie, sir, withsuch volubility,

411
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.700
that you would think truthwere a fool:

412
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.330
What's his brother, theother Captain Dumain?

413
00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:35.270
Why does be ask him of me?

414
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.730
What's he?

415
00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:39.070
E'en a crow o' the samenest;

416
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.330
he excels his brother fora coward,

417
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.670
yet his brother is reputedone of the best that is:

418
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.330
If your life be saved,

419
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.230
will you undertake tobetray the Florentine?

420
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:55.230
Ay, and the captain of hishorse, Count Rousillon.

421
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.030
I'll whisper with the general,and know his pleasure.

422
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:08.870
I'll no more drumming; aplague of all drums!

423
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.700
Only to seem to deservewell,

424
00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:11.870
and to beguile thesupposition

425
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.170
of that lasciviousyoung boy

426
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.270
the count, have I run intothis danger.

427
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.000
Yet who would havesuspected an ambush

428
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.030
where I was taken?

429
00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:28.400
There is no remedy, sir,but you must die:

430
00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:31.000
the general says, you thathave so traitorously

431
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.200
discovered the secrets ofyour army and made such

432
00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.570
pestiferous reports of menvery nobly held,

433
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:40.200
can serve the world for nohonest use;

434
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.470
therefore you must die.

435
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.670
Come, headsman, off withhis head.

436
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:35.670
O Lord, sir, let me live,or let me see my death!

437
00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:40.500
That shall you, and take yourleave of all your friends.

438
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.400
look about you: know youany here?

439
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.570
Good morrow, noblecaptain.

440
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.400
God bless you, CaptainParolles.

441
00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.270
God save you, noblecaptain.

442
00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:02.000
Captain, what greetingwill you to my Lord Lafeu?

443
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.100
I am for France.

444
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.830
Good captain, will you giveme a copy of the sonnet

445
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:09.430
you writ to Diana in behalfof the Count Rousillon?

446
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:13.900
an I were not a very coward,I'ld compel it of you:

447
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:14.970
but fare you well.

448
00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:26.970
You are undone, captain,all but your scarf;

449
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.630
that has a knot on't yet

450
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.600
Who cannot be crushed witha plot?

451
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.770
If you could find out acountry

452
00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.900
where but women were thathad received so much shame,

453
00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.800
you might begin animpudent nation.

454
00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:43.130
Fare ye well, sir; I amfor France too:

455
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.970
we shall speak of youthere.

456
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.800
Yet am I thankful: if myheart were great,

457
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:08.600
'Twould burst at this.Captain I'll be no more;

458
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.770
But I will eat and drink,and sleep as soft

459
00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:14.700
As captain shall: simplythe thing I am

460
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.200
Shall make me live. Whoknows himself a braggart,

461
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.270
Let him fear this, for itwill come to pass

462
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.930
that every braggart shallbe found an ass.

463
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:27.800
Rust, sword? cool, blushes!and, Parolles, live

464
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:34.800
Safest in shame! beingfool'd, by foolery thrive!

465
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:41.200
There's place and meansfor every man alive.

466
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.670
I'll after them.

467
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.430
That you may well perceiveI have not wrong'd you,

468
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.000
One of the greatest in theChristian world

469
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.130
Shall be my surety; 'forewhose throne 'tis needful,

470
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:54.170
Ere I can perfect mineintents, to kneel:

471
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:57.630
Time was, I did him adesired office,

472
00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:00.870
Dear almost as his life

473
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.900
You must know I amsupposed dead:

474
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.130
the army breaking,

475
00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:11.800
My husband hies him home;where, heaven aiding,

476
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.500
And by the leave of mygood lord the king,

477
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.770
We'll be before ourwelcome.

478
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:16.670
Gentle madam,

479
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.300
You never had a servant towhose trust

480
00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.170
Your business was morewelcome.

481
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:21.200
Nor you, mistress,

482
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.970
Ever a friend whosethoughts more truly labour

483
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:26.100
To recompense your love:doubt not but heaven

484
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.800
Hath brought me up to beyour daughter's dower,

485
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.100
As it hath fated her to bemy motive

486
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:36.000
And helper to a husband.But, O strange men!

487
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.430
That can such sweet usemake of what they hate,

488
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.070
But more of thishereafter. You, Diana,

489
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.330
Under my poor instructionsyet must suffer

490
00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.770
Something in my behalf.

491
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:48.970
Let death and honesty

492
00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.830
Go with your impositions,I am yours

493
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.470
Upon your will to suffer.

494
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:57.230
Yet, I pray you:

495
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:04.000
But with the word the timewill bring on summer,

496
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.330
When briers shall haveleaves as well as thorns,

497
00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:12.300
And be as sweet as sharp.We must away;

498
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:17.930
Our wagon is prepared, andtime revives us:

499
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:38.770
All's well that ends well;still the fine's the crown;

500
00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:43.370
Whate'er the course, theend is the renown.

501
00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:49.070
No, no, no, your son wasmisled with a snipt-taffeta

502
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:51.800
fellow there, whosevillanous saffron

503
00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.670
would have made all theunbaked and doughy youth

504
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:56.430
of a nation in his colour:

505
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.970
your daughter-in-law hadbeen alive at this hour,

506
00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:00.570
and your son here at home,

507
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.000
more advanced by the king

508
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.030
than by that red-tailedhumble-bee I speak of.

509
00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:07.230
I would I had not knownhim;

510
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.300
it was the death of themost virtuous gentlewoman

511
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.170
that ever nature hadpraise for creating.

512
00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:14.900
If she had partaken ofmy flesh,

513
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.670
and cost me the dearestgroans of a mother,

514
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:20.000
I could not have owed hera more rooted love.

515
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.600
'Twas a good lady, 'twas agood lady:

516
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.100
we may pick a thousandsalads

517
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.830
ere we light on suchanother herb.

518
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:30.130
Indeed, sir, she was thesweet marjoram of the salad,

519
00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:31.700
or rather, the herb ofgrace.

520
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.400
They are not herbs, youknave; they arenose-herbs.

521
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.030
I am no greatNebuchadnezzar, sir;

522
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:37.700
I have not much skill ingrass.

523
00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.230
Whether dost thou professthyself, a knave or a fool?

524
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.100
A fool, sir, at a woman'sservice,

525
00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.900
and a knave ata man's.

526
00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.000
Your distinction?

527
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.030
I would cozen the man of hiswife and do his service.

528
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.270
So you were a knave at hisservice, indeed.

529
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:54.600
And I would give his wifemy bauble, sir, to do herservice.

At your service.

532
00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:00.270
No, no, no.

533
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:02.930
Why, sir, if I cannotserve you,

534
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:06.570
I can serve as great aprince as you are.

535
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.530
What prince is that?

536
00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:10.530
The black prince, sir;alias,

537
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:16.570
the prince of darkness;alias, the devil.

538
00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:20.600
Hold thee, there's mypurse:

539
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.300
I give thee not this tosuggest thee

540
00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.630
from thy master thoutalkest of;

541
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.670
serve him still.

542
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.830
I am a woodland fellow,sir,

543
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:32.100
that always loved a greatfire;

544
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.570
and the master I speak ofever keeps a good fire.

545
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:39.030
But, sure, he is theprince of the world;

546
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:42.500
let his nobility remainin's court.

547
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.430
I am for the house withthe narrow gate,

548
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:49.100
which I take to be.toolittle for pomp to enter:

549
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.870
some that humblethemselves may;

550
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:56.130
but the many will be toochill and tender,

551
00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:58.700
and they'll be for theflowery way

552
00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:03.330
that leads to the broadgate and the great fire.

553
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:12.770
A shrewd knave and anunhappy.

554
00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.770
So he is.

555
00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:18.200
My late lord that's gonemade himself much sportout of him:

556
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.130
by his authority heremains here,

557
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.270
which he thinks is apatent for his sauciness;

558
00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.730
and, indeed, he has nopace, but runs where hewill.

559
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.830
I like him well; 'tis notamiss.

560
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:32.030
And I was about to tellyou,

561
00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:35.970
since I heard of the goodlady's death

562
00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:39.070
and that my lord your sonwas upon his return home,

563
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:44.170
I moved his majesty tospeak in the behalf of mydaughter;

564
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:49.170
which, in the minority ofthem both, his majesty,

565
00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:53.800
out of a self-graciousremembrance, did firstpropose:

566
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.700
his highness hath promisedme to do it:

567
00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.370
and, to stop up thedispleasure

568
00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:01.100
he hath conceived againstyour son,

569
00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.830
there is no fitter matter.

570
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:07.230
How does your ladyshiplike it?

571
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.300
With very much content

572
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.830
and I wish it happilyeffected.

573
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.100
His highness will be heretomorrow

574
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.770
of as able body as when henumbered thirty:

575
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:20.570
It rejoices me, that I hopeI shall see him ere I die.

576
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:22.670
I have letters that my sonwill be here this evening

577
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:27.300
and I shall beseech yourlordship to remain me tillthey meet together.

578
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.600
Madam, I was thinking withwhat manners I mightsafely be admitted.

579
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.200
You need but plead yourhonourable privilege.

580
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.000
Lady, of that I have madea bold charter;

581
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.670
