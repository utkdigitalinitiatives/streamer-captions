00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800


2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.730
And thus have I yielded up intoyour hand,

3
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.500
The circle of my glory.

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.000
Take again, from this my hand,as holding of the pope

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.600
Your sovereign greatnessand authority.

6
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.770
Now keep your holy word:go meet the French,

7
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.670
And from his holiness useall your power

8
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.130
To stop their marches'fore we are inflamed.

9
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.570
Our discontented countiesdo revolt;

10
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.530
Our people quarrel withobedience,

11
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.370
Swearing allegiance andthe love of soul

12
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.800
To stranger blood, toforeign royalty.

13
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.970
This inundation ofmistemper'd humour

14
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.900
Rests by you only to bequalified:

15
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.370
Then pause not; for thepresent time's so sick,

16
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.070
That present medicine mustbe minister'd,

17
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.530
Or overthrow incurableensues.

18
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.770
It was my breath that blewthis tempest up,

19
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.600
Upon your stubborn usageof the pope;

20
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.930
But now you are a gentleconvertite,

21
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.700
My tongue shall hush againthis storm of war

22
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.800
And make fair weather inyour blustering land.

23
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.400
On this Ascension-day,remember well,

24
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.600
Upon your oath of serviceto the pope,

25
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.600
Go I to make the Frenchlay down their arms.

26
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.200
Is this Ascension-day?Did not the prophet

27
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.430
Say that beforeAscension-day at noon

28
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.930
My crown I should giveoff? Even so I have:

29
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.330
I did suppose it should beon constraint:

30
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.230
But, heaven be thank'd, itis but voluntary.

31
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.330
All Kent hath yielded;nothing there holds out

32
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.930
But Dover castle: Londonhath received,

33
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.370
Like a kind host, theDauphin and his powers:

34
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.730
Your nobles will not hearyou, but are gone

35
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.370
To offer service to yourenemy,

36
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.600
And wild amazement hurriesup and down

37
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.370
The little number of yourdoubtful friends.

38
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.530
Would not my lords returnto me again,

39
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.870
After they heard youngArthur was alive?

40
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.800
They found him dead andcast into the streets,

41
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.500
An empty casket, where thejewel of life

42
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.130
By some damn'd hand wasrobb'd and ta'en away.

43
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.530
That villain Hubert toldme he did live.

44
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.370
So, on my soul, he did,for aught he knew.

45
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.430
But wherefore do youdroop? why look you sad?

46
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.070
Be great in act, as youhave been in thought;

47
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.130
Let not the world see fearand sad distrust

48
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.130
Govern the motion of akingly eye:

49
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.670
Be stirring as the time;be fire with fire;

50
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.570
Threaten the threatenerand outface the brow

51
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.070
Of bragging horror: soshall inferior eyes,

52
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.400
That borrow theirbehaviors from the great,

53
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.600
Grow great by your exampleand put on

54
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.200
The dauntless spirit ofresolution.

55
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.800
Away, and glister like thegod of war,

56
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.430
When he intendeth tobecome the field:

57
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:21.770
Show boldness and aspiringconfidence.

58
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.470
What, shall they seek thelion in his den,

59
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.700
And fright him there? andmake him tremble there?

60
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.600
O, let it not be said:forage, and run

61
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.600
To meet displeasurefarther from the doors,

62
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.200
And grapple with him erehe comes so nigh.

63
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.370
The legate of the popehath been with me,

64
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.270
And I have made a happypeace with him;

65
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.530
And he hath promised todismiss the powers

66
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.270
Led by the Dauphin.

67
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.200
O inglorious league!

68
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.230
Shall we, upon the footingof our land,

69
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.730
Send fair-play orders andmake compromise,

70
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.870
Insinuation, parley andbase truce

71
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.400
To arms invasive? shall abeardless boy,

72
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.070
A cocker'd silken wanton,brave our fields,

73
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.200
And flesh his spirit in awarlike soil,

74
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.070
Mocking the air withcolours idly spread,

75
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.530
And find no cheque? Letus, my liege, to arms:

76
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
Perchance the cardinalcannot make your peace;

77
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.270
Or if he do, let it atleast be said

78
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.700
They saw we had a purposeof defence.

79
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:58.000
Have thou the ordering ofthis present time.

80
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:11.130
Away, then, with goodcourage! yet, I know,

81
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.070
Our party may well meet aprouder foe.

82
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.430
(â™ªmusic to end scene)

83
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.600


84
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.430
My Lord Melun, let this becopied out,

85
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.500
And keep it safe for ourremembrance:

86
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.300
Return the precedent tothese lords again;

87
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.370
That, having our fairorder written down,

88
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.170
Both they and we, perusingo'er these notes,

89
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.870
May know wherefore we tookthe sacrament

90
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.530
And keep our faiths firmand inviolable.

91
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.070
Upon our sides it nevershall be broken.

92
00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.370
And, noble Dauphin, albeitwe swear

93
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.130
A voluntary zeal and anunurged faith

94
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.500
To your proceedings; yetbelieve me, prince,

95
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.430
I am not glad that such asore of time

96
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.100
Should seek a plaster bycontemn'd revolt,

97
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.470
And heal the inveteratecanker of one wound

98
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.130
By making many. O, itgrieves my soul,

99
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.000
That I must draw thismetal from my side

100
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.370
To be a widow-maker! O,and there

101
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.900
Where honourable rescueand defence

102
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.570
Cries out upon the name ofSalisbury!

103
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.000
But such is the infectionof the time,

104
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.800
That, for the health andphysic of our right,

105
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.600
We cannot deal but withthe very hand

106
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.400
Of stern injustice andconfused wrong.

107
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.400
And is't not pity, O mygrieved friends,

108
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.600
That we, the sons andchildren of this isle,

109
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.700
Were born to see so sad anhour as this;

110
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.230
Wherein we step after astranger march

111
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.500
Upon her gentle bosom, andfill up

112
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:07.700
Her enemies' ranks,--Imust withdraw and weep

113
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:13.330
Upon the spot of thisenforced cause,--

114
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:18.200
To grace the gentry of aland remote,

115
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.830
And follow unacquaintedcolours here?

116
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:27.330
What, here? O nation, thatthou couldst remove!

117
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.130
That Neptune's arms, whoclippeth thee about,

118
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.270
Would bear thee from theknowledge of thyself,

119
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.630
And grapple thee unto apagan shore;

120
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.470
Where these two Christianarmies might combine

121
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.170
The blood of malice in avein of league,

122
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.630
And not to spend it sounneighbourly!

123
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.870
A noble temper dost thoushow in this;

124
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.700
And great affectionswrestling in thy bosom

125
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.300
Doth make an earthquake ofnobility.

126
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.000
O, what a noble combathast thou fought

127
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.370
Between compulsion and abrave respect!

128
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.430
Let me wipe off thishonourable dew,

129
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.730
That silverly dothprogress on thy cheeks:

130
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.430
My heart hath melted at alady's tears,

131
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.800
Being an ordinaryinundation;

132
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.730
But this effusion of suchmanly drops,

133
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:35.930
This shower, blown up bytempest of the soul,

134
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:40.270
Startles mine eyes, andmakes me more amazed

135
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.070
Than had I seen the vaultytop of heaven

136
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:47.930
Figured quite o'er withburning meteors.

137
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:52.700
Lift up thy brow, renownedSalisbury,

138
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.000
And with a great heartheave away the storm:

139
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.070
Commend these waters tothose baby eyes

140
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.470
That never saw the giantworld enraged;

141
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.100
Nor met with fortune otherthan at feasts,

142
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.900
Full of warm blood, ofmirth, of gossiping.

143
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:13.400
Come, come; for thou shaltthrust thy hand as deep

144
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.570
Into the purse of richprosperity

145
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:22.270
As Lewis himself: so,nobles, shall you all,

146
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:26.770
That knit your sinews tothe strength of mine.

147
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.230
And even there, methinks,an angel spake:

148
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:33.330
(â™ªchanting)

149
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.570
Look, where the holylegate comes apace,

150
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.430
To give us warrant fromthe hand of heaven

151
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.600
And on our actions set thename of right

152
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.370
With holy breath.

153
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:47.530
Hail, noble prince ofFrance!

154
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.930
The next is this, KingJohn hath reconciled

155
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.570
Himself to Rome; hisspirit is come in,

156
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.830
That so stood out againstthe holy church,

157
00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.600
The great metropolis andsee of Rome:

158
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.170
Therefore thy threateningcolours now wind up;

159
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:08.330
And tame the savage spiritof wild war,

160
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.930
That like a lion foster'dup at hand,

161
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.330
It may lie gently at thefoot of peace,

162
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.870
And be no further harmfulthan in show.

163
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.630
Your grace shall pardonme, I will not back:

164
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:31.170
I am too high-born to bepropertied,

165
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.500
To be a secondary atcontrol,

166
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.530
Or useful serving-man andinstrument,

167
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:39.130
To any sovereign statethroughout the world.

168
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.470
Your breath first kindledthe dead coal of wars

169
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.930
Between this chastisedkingdom and myself,

170
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.330
And brought in matter thatshould feed this fire;

171
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.670
And now 'tis far too hugeto be blown out

172
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.230
With that same weak windwhich enkindled it.

173
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:58.070
You taught me how to knowthe face of right,

174
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.200
Acquainted me withinterest to this land,

175
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.730
Yea, thrust thisenterprise into my heart;

176
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.330
And come ye now to tell meJohn hath made

177
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:10.570
His peace with Rome? Whatis that peace to me?

178
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.870
I, by the honour of mymarriage-bed,

179
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.870
After young Arthur, claimthis land for mine;

180
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.630
And, now it ishalf-conquer'd, must I back

181
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.230
Because that John hathmade his peace with Rome?

182
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:24.100
Am I Rome's slave? Whatpenny hath Rome borne,

183
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.800
What men provided, whatmunition sent,

184
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.930
To underprop this action?Is't not I

185
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.030
That undergo this charge?who else but I,

186
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.600
And such as to my claimare liable,

187
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.470
Sweat in this business andmaintain this war?

188
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.630
Have I not heard theseislanders shout out

189
00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.930
'Vive le roi!' as I havebank'd their towns?

190
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.830
Have I not here the bestcards for the game,

191
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.070
To win this easy matchplay'd for a crown?

192
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:54.630
And shall I now give o'erthe yielded set?

193
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:59.270
No, no, on my soul, itnever shall be said.

194
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.330
You look but on theoutside of this work.

195
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.800
Outside or inside, I willnot return

196
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.470
Till my attempt so much beglorified

197
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.500
As to my ample hope waspromised

198
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.100
Before I drew this gallanthead of war,

199
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.130
And cull'd these fieryspirits from the world,

200
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:19.470
To outlook conquest and towin renown

201
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.470
Even in the jaws of dangerand of death.

202
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.830
(â™ªTrumpets)

203
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.530
What lusty trumpet thusdoth summon us?

204
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.100
According to the fair playof the world,

205
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.470
Let me have audience; I amsent to speak:

206
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.730
My holy lord of Milan,from the king

207
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.630
I come, to learn how youhave dealt for him;

208
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.170
And, as you answer, I doknow the scope

209
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:52.300
And warrant limited untomy tongue.

210
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:59.430
The Dauphin is toowilful-opposite,

211
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:04.000
And will not temporizewith my entreaties;

212
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
He flatly says he'll notlay down his arms.

213
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.600
By all the blood that everfury breathed,

214
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:16.400
The youth says well. Nowhear our English king;

215
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.570
For thus his royalty dothspeak in me.

216
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:24.600
He is prepared, and reasontoo he should:

217
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.630
This apish and unmannerlyapproach,

218
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.600
This harness'd masque andunadvised revel,

219
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.000
This unhair'd saucinessand boyish troops,

220
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.900
The king doth smile at;and is well prepared

221
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.200
To whip this dwarfish war,these pigmy arms,

222
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.500
From out the circle of histerritories.

223
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.400
That hand which had thestrength, even at your door,

224
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.000
To cudgel you and make youtake the hatch,

225
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.170
To dive like buckets inconcealed wells,

226
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:54.430
To crouch in litter ofyour stable planks,

227
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.700
To lie like pawns lock'dup in chests and trunks,

228
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.770
To hug with swine, to seeksweet safety out

229
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.100
In vaults and prisons, andto thrill and shake

230
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.800
Even at the crying of yournation's crow,

231
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.670
Thinking his voice anarmed Englishman;

232
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.970
Shall that victorious handbe feebled here,

233
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.870
That in your chambers gaveyou chastisement?

234
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:14.170
No: know the gallantmonarch is in arms

235
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.430
And like an eagle o'er hisaery towers,

236
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:19.600
To souse annoyance thatcomes near his nest.

237
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.430
And you degenerate, youingrate revolts,

238
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.430
You bloody Neroes, rippingup the womb

239
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.930
Of your dear motherEngland, blush for shame;

240
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.770
For your own ladies andpale-visaged maids

241
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.270
Like Amazons come trippingafter drums,

242
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.330
Their thimbles into armedgauntlets change,

243
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.130
Their needles to lances,and their gentle hearts

244
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.970
To fierce and bloodyinclination.

245
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:46.130
There end thy brave, andturn thy face in peace;

246
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.330
We grant thou canst outscoldus: fare thee well;

247
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.730
We hold our time tooprecious to be spent

248
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.270
With such a brabbler.

249
00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.470
Give me leave to speak.

250
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.630
No, I will speak.

251
00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.730
We will attend to neither.

252
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.030
Strike up the drums; andlet the tongue of war

253
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:04.000
Plead for our interest andour being here.

254
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.970
Indeed your drums, beingbeaten, will cry out;

255
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:11.400
And so shall you, beingbeaten: do but start

256
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.830
An echo with the clamourof thy drum,

257
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.770
And even at hand a drum isready braced

258
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.330
That shall reverberate allas loud as thine;

259
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:18.930
Sound but another, andanother shall

260
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.770
As loud as thine rattlethe welkin's ear

261
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.600
And mock the deep-mouth'dthunder: for at hand,

262
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.330
Not trusting to thishalting legate here,

263
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.000
Whom he hath used ratherfor sport than need

264
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.530
Is warlike John; and inhis forehead sits

265
00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.470
A bare-ribb'd death, whoseoffice is this day

266
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.170
To feast upon wholethousands of the French.

267
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.130
Strike up our drums, tofind this danger out.

268
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:45.370
And thou shalt find it,Dauphin, do not doubt.

269
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:51.030
(â™ªdrums pound)

270
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:56.200
How goes the day with us?O, tell me, Hubert.

271
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.870
Badly, I fear. How faresyour majesty?

272
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.270
This fever, that hathtroubled me so long,

273
00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:07.470
Lies heavy on me; O, myheart is sick!

274
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.600
My lord, your valiantkinsman, Faulconbridge,

275
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.770
Desires your majesty toleave the field

276
00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.070
And send him word by mewhich way you go.

277
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:19.170
Tell him, toward Swinstead,to the abbey there.

278
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.030
Be of good comfort; forthe great supply

279
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.870
That was expected by theDauphin here,

280
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.600
Are wreck'd three nightsago on Goodwin Sands.

281
00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.030
This news was brought toRichard but even now:

282
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:34.930
The French fight coldly,and retire themselves.

283
00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.700
Ay me! this tyrant feverburns me up,

284
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.770
And will not let mewelcome this good news.

285
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:48.130
Set on toward Swinstead:to my litter straight;

286
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:54.170
Weakness possesseth me,and I am faint.

287
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:04.530
I did not think the kingso stored with friends.

288
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.300
Up once again; put spiritin the French:

289
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.570
If they miscarry, wemiscarry too.

290
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.400
That misbegotten devil,Faulconbridge,

291
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.870
In spite of spite, aloneupholds the day.

292
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:18.030
They say King John soresick hath left the field.

293
00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.000
Lead me to the revolts ofEngland here.

294
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.800
When we were happy we hadother names.

295
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.330
It is the Count Melun.

296
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:27.530
Wounded to death.

297
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:33.030
Fly, noble English, youare bought and sold;

298
00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.600
Unthread the rude eye ofrebellion

299
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.800
And welcome home againdiscarded faith.

300
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.200
Seek out King John andfall before his feet;

301
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.770
For if the French be lordsof this loud day,

302
00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.830
He means to recompense thepains you take

303
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.330
By cutting off your heads:thus hath he sworn

304
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.630
And I with him, and manymoe with me,

305
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.530
Upon the altar at SaintEdmundsbury;

306
00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:56.970
Even on that altar wherewe swore to you

307
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.800
Dear amity and everlastinglove.

308
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.200
May this be possible? maythis be true?

309
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.500
Have I not hideous deathwithin my view,

310
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.230
Retaining but a quantityof life,

311
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.970
Which bleeds away, even asa form of wax

312
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:18.630
Resolveth from his figure'gainst the fire?

313
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:23.000
What in the world shouldmake me now deceive,

314
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.800
Since I must lose the useof all deceit?

315
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.730
Why should I then befalse, since it is true

316
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:35.400
That I must die here andlive hence by truth?

317
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.470
I say again, if Lewis dowin the day,

318
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.970
He is forsworn, if e'erthose eyes of yours

319
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.800
Behold another day breakin the east:

320
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.930
But even this night, whoseblack contagious breath

321
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.770
Already smokes about theburning crest

322
00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.470
Of the old, feeble andday-wearied sun,

323
00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:02.570
Even this ill night, yourbreathing shall expire,

324
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.470
Paying the fine of ratedtreachery

325
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:07.570
Even with a treacherousfine of all your lives,

326
00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:13.230
If Lewis by yourassistance win the day.

327
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:18.870
Commend me to one Hubertwith your king:

328
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.400
The love of him, and thisrespect besides,

329
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.930
For that my grandsire wasan Englishman,

330
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:30.730
Awakes my conscience toconfess all this.

331
00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:35.170
In lieu whereof, I prayyou, bear me hence

332
00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:39.700
From forth the noise andrumour of the field,

333
00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.430
Where I may think theremnant of my thoughts

334
00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:47.730
In peace, and part thisbody and my soul

335
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:53.230
With contemplation anddevout desires.

336
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:57.070
We do believe thee: andbeshrew my soul

337
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.670
But I do love the favourand the form

338
00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.700
Of this most fairoccasion, by the which

339
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.830
We will untread the stepsof damned flight,

340
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.000
And like a bated andretired flood,

341
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.170
Leaving our rankness andirregular course,

342
00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.000
Stoop low within thosebounds we have o'erlook'd

343
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.930
And cabby run on inobedience

344
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.870
Even to our ocean, to ourgreat King John.

345
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.630
My arm shall give theehelp to bear thee hence;

346
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.300
For I do see the cruelpangs of death

347
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:29.570
Right in thine eye. Away,my friends! New flight;

348
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:33.600
And happy newness, thatintends old right.

349
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.500
The sun of heaven methoughtwas loath to set,

350
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.930
But stay'd and made thewestern welkin blush,

351
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.900
When English measurebackward their own ground

352
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.430
In faint retire. O,bravely came we off,

353
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.470
When with a volley of ourneedless shot,

354
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.870
After such bloody toil, webid good night;

355
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:53.330
And wound our tatteringcolours clearly up,

356
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.970
Last in the field, andalmost lords of it!

357
00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.930
Where is my prince, theDauphin?

358
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.630
Here: what news?

359
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.900
The Count Melun is slain;the English lords

360
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:14.570
by his persuasion areagain fall'n off,

361
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.300
And your supply, whichyou have wish'd so long,

362
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.330
Are cast away and sunk onGoodwin Sands.

363
00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:31.570
Ah, foul shrewd news!beshrew thy very heart!

364
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.130
I did not think to be sosad to-night

365
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:41.470
As this hath made me. Whowas he that said

366
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.970
King John did fly an houror two before

367
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.400
The stumbling night didpart our weary powers?

368
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.170
Whoever spoke it, it istrue, my lord.

369
00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:54.430
Well; keep good quarterand good care to-night:

370
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:57.000
The day shall not be up sosoon as I,

371
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.500
To try the fair adventure ofto-morrow.

372
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.870
(â™ªhorns)

373
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.830
Who's there? speak, ho!speak quickly, or I shoot.

374
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.230
A friend. What art thou?

375
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.370
Of the part of England.

376
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:26.570
Whither dost thou go?

377
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.830
What's that to thee? whymay not I demand

378
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.870
Of thine affairs, as wellas thou of mine?

379
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.430
Hubert, I think?

380
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.530
Thou hast a perfectthought:

381
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.070
I will upon all hazardswell believe

382
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.470
Thou art my friend, thatknow'st my tongue so well.

383
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:40.900
Who art thou?

384
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.230
Who thou wilt: and if thouplease,

385
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.100
Thou mayst befriend me somuch as to think

386
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.470
I come one way of thePlantagenets.

387
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:52.430
Unkind remembrance! thouand eyeless night

388
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.070
Have done me shame: bravesoldier, pardon me,

389
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.930
That any accent breakingfrom thy tongue

390
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.930
Should 'scape the trueacquaintance of mine ear.

391
00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.900
Come, come; sans compliment,what news abroad?

392
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.900
Why, here walk I in theblack brow of night,

393
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.930
To find you out.

394
00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.770
Brief, then; and what'sthe news?

395
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.270
O, my sweet sir, newsfitting to the night,

396
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:15.800
Black, fearful,comfortless and horrible.

397
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.070
Show me the very wound ofthis ill news:

398
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.130
I am no woman, I'll notswoon at it.

399
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:23.070
The king, I fear, ispoison'd by a monk:

400
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.970
I left him almostspeechless; and broke out

401
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.400
To acquaint you with thisevil, that you might

402
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.930
The better arm you to thesudden time,

403
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:32.500
Than if you had at leisureknown of this.

404
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.870
How did he take it? whodid taste to him?

405
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:38.500
A monk, I tell you; aresolved villain,

406
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.500
Whose bowels suddenlyburst out: the king

407
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:45.470
Yet speaks andperadventure may recover.

408
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:48.570
Who didst thou leave totend his majesty?

409
00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:53.400
Why, know you not? thelords are all come back,

410
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.300
And brought Prince Henryin their company;

411
00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.670
At whose request the kinghath pardon'd them,

412
00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:01.330
And they are all about hismajesty.

413
00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:07.670
Withhold thine indignation,mighty heaven,

414
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:11.530
And tempt us not to bearabove our power!

415
00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:15.100
I'll tell tree, Hubert,half my power this night,

416
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.130
Passing these flats, aretaken by the tide;

417
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:22.170
These Lincoln Washes havedevoured them;

418
00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:27.970
Myself, well mounted,hardly have escaped.

419
00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.970
Away before: conduct me tothe king;

420
00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:32.970
I doubt he will be dead orere I come.

421
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:47.170
(â™ª bells and chanting

422
00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:55.500
(â™ª bells and chanting

423
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.400
It is too late: the lifeof all his blood

424
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.970
Is touch'd corruptibly,and his pure brain,

425
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.570
Which some suppose thesoul's frail dwelling-house,

426
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:07.900
Doth by the idle commentsthat it makes

427
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.500
Foretell the ending ofmortality.

428
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.130
His highness yet dothspeak, and holds belief

429
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:14.100
That, being brought intothe open air,

430
00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.270
It would allay the burningquality

431
00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:20.670
Of that fell poison whichassaileth him.

432
00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:24.330
Let him be brought intothe orchard here.

433
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.070
Doth he still rage?

434
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.370
He is more patient

435
00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:33.200
Than when you left him;even now he sung.

436
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.730
O vanity of sickness!fierce extremes

437
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:39.530
In their continuance willnot feel themselves.

438
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:41.670
Death, having prey'd uponthe outward parts,

439
00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:45.200
Leaves them invisible, andhis siege is now

440
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.530
Against the mind, thewhich he pricks and wounds

441
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:52.130
With many legions ofstrange fantasies,

442
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:56.070
Which, in their throng andpress to that last hold,

443
00:25:56.070 --> 00:26:01.870
Confound themselves. 'Tisstrange that death

444
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.670
should sing.

445
00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.530
I am the cygnet to thispale faint swan,

446
00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.630
Who chants a doleful hymnto his own death,

447
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.230
And from the organ-pipe offrailty sings

448
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:15.200
His soul and body to theirlasting rest.

449
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.670
Be of good comfort,prince; for you are born

450
00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.700
To set a form upon thatindigest

451
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.630
Which he hath left soshapeless and so rude.

452
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:31.300
(â™ªchanting)

453
00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:37.870
Ay, marry, now my soulhath elbow-room;

454
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:43.600
It would not out atwindows nor at doors.

455
00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:48.000
There is so hot a summerin my bosom,

456
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.030
That all my bowels crumbleup to dust:

457
00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:57.270
I am a scribbled form,drawn with a pen

458
00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:03.500
Upon a parchment, andagainst this fire

459
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.330
Do I shrink up.

460
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:08.700
How fares your majesty?

461
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:18.170
Poison'd,--ill fare--dead,forsook, cast off:

462
00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:20.970
And none of you will bidthe winter come

463
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:25.130
To thrust his icy fingersin my maw,

464
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:28.630
Nor let my kingdom'srivers take their course

465
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:32.670
Through my burn'd bosom,nor entreat the north

466
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:37.600
To make his bleak windskiss my parched lips

467
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:42.600
And comfort me with cold.I do not ask you much,

468
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:48.570
I beg cold comfort; andyou are so strait

469
00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:51.470
And so ingrateful, youdeny me that.

470
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.200
O that there were somevirtue in my tears,

471
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.400
That might relieve you!

472
00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:00.730
The salt in them is hot.

473
00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:07.300
Within me is a hell; andthere the poison

474
00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.170
Is as a fiend confined totyrannize

475
00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:16.600
On unreprievable condemnedblood.

476
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.270
O, I am scalded with myviolent motion,

477
00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:23.230
And spleen of speed to seeyour majesty!

478
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:29.430
O cousin, thou art come toset mine eye:

479
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:36.830
The tackle of my heart iscrack'd and burn'd,

480
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:41.130
And all the shrouds wherewithmy life should sail

481
00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:47.300
Are turned to one hair,one little thread:

482
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:52.900
My heart hath one poorstring to stay it by,

483
00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:57.270
Which holds but till thynews be uttered;

484
00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:02.170
And then all this thouseest is but a clod

485
00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:07.200
And module of confoundedroyalty.

486
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.530
The Dauphin is preparinghitherward,

487
00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.330
Where God He knows howwe shall answer him;

488
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:14.170
For in a night the bestpart of my power,

489
00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:15.830
As I upon advantage didremove,

490
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.200
Were in the Washes allunwarily

491
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.500
Devoured by the unexpectedflood.

492
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:31.470
You breathe these deadnews in as dead an ear.

493
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:37.800
My liege! my lord! but nowa king, now thus.

494
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:44.300
Even so must I run on, andeven so stop.

495
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:49.730
What surety of the world,what hope, what stay,

496
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:54.930
When this was now a king,and now is clay?

497
00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:01.200
Art thou gone so? I do butstay behind

498
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.130
To do the office for theeof revenge,

499
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:06.400
And then my soul shallwait on thee to heaven,

500
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.370
As it on earth hath beenthy servant still.

501
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:20.130
Now, now, you stars thatmove in your right spheres,

502
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:22.300
Where be your powers? shownow your mended faiths,

503
00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.000
And instantly return withme again,

504
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.070
To push destruction andperpetual shame

505
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:27.630
Out of the weak door ofour fainting land.

506
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.200
Straight let us seek, orstraight we shall be sought;

507
00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.870
The Dauphin rages at ourvery heels.

508
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.770
It seems you know not,then, so much as we:

509
00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:37.430
The Cardinal Pandulph iswithin at rest,

510
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:38.730
Who half an hour sincecame from the Dauphin,

511
00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:42.600
And brings from him suchoffers of our peace

512
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.730
As we with honour andrespect may take,

513
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.730
With purpose presently toleave this war.

514
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.230
He will the rather do itwhen he sees

515
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:50.800
Ourselves well sinewed toour defence.

516
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.130
Nay, it is in a mannerdone already;

517
00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:54.600
For many carriages he hathdispatch'd

518
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.630
To the sea-side, and puthis cause and quarrel

519
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:58.830
To the disposing of thecardinal:

520
00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:01.570
With whom yourself, myselfand other lords,

521
00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:04.230
If you think meet, thisafternoon will post

522
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:10.300
To consummate thisbusiness happily.

523
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:16.300
Let it be so: and you, mynoble prince,

524
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.070
With other princes thatmay best be spared,

525
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.330
Shall wait upon yourfather's funeral.

526
00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.730
At Worcester must his bodybe interr'd;

527
00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.970
For so he will'd it.

528
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:28.930
Thither shall it then:

529
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:30.930
And happily may your sweetself put on

530
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.470
The lineal state and gloryof the land!

531
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:38.170
To whom with allsubmission, on my knee

532
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.370
I do bequeath my faithfulservices

533
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:43.770
And true subjectioneverlastingly.

534
00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:45.670
And the like tender of ourlove we make,

535
00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:49.070
To rest without a spot forevermore.

536
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:51.370
I have a kind soul thatwould give you thanks

537
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:54.130
And knows not how to do itbut with tears.

538
00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:57.430
O, let us pay the time butneedful woe,

539
00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:00.770
Since it hath beenbeforehand with our griefs.

540
00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:04.430
This England never did,nor never shall,

541
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:07.100
Lie at the proud foot of aconqueror,

542
00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:10.300
But when it first did helpto wound itself.

543
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.570
Now these her princes arecome home again,

544
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.170
Come the three corners ofthe world in arms,

545
00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:17.130
And we shall shock them.Nought shall make us rue,

546
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:21.730
If England to itself dorest but true.

547
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.500
(â™ªchanting)

548
00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:50.830
