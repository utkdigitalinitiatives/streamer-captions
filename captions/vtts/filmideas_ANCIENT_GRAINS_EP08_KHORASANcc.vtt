(upbeat music)

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:37.625
(soft music)

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:43.166
- [Voiceover] Along with
the continued cultivation

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.208
of some popular ancient grains

00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:50.999
like quinoa, wheat,
barley, and rice

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:00.500
is the preservation of
their long histories.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.000
Accounts of their
origins and survival

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.083
thousands of years ago
have been handed down

00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:15.083
from one generation to the next.

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:19.999
But the same thing
can not be said

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:23.709
for the ancient
grain, khorasan wheat.

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:30.834
Aside from it's origin
there is also some dispute

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:34.999
over it's exact
taxonomic classification.

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:39.125
Scientists from
the United States,

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:44.959
Canada, Italy,
Israel, and Russia

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:46.291
have not been able to arrive

00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:49.542
at a single conclusive result.

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:53.083
While all agree that it
belongs to Triticum specie

00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:56.250
they can't agree on
it's sub species.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.125
Based on early studies,
it has been identified

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:01.500
as polonicum, or Polish wheat.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.792
But then some believe it is
a variety of durum wheat.

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.041
Today, most scientists identify

00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:16.999
the grain sub
species as turanicum.

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:19.333
Most commonly called,
khorasan wheat.

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:24.333
And it's origin can be traced
back to the Fertile Crescent.

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:25.999
It's common name is derived from

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.291
the great Persian
province called, Khorasan.

00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:31.667
Which is now divided
between Iran,

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:36.999
Afghanistan, Uzbekistan,
and Tajikistan.

00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:40.542
Physically, khorasan
wheat doesn't stray far

00:02:40.542 --> 00:02:42.583
from common wheat's features.

00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:45.166
But it's grains are
two times bigger

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:49.000
and it's kernel
weighs up to 60 grams.

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:52.999
Believed to have
been first cultivated

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:53.999
in the Middle East.

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.959
Khorasan wheat is
tolerant to drought.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.917
Because this grain didn't
travel far and wide,

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:02.333
like maize and barley,
it's adaptation

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:06.250
to varying climate and soil
conditions is difficult

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.500
if not impossible.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.250
It still prefers the tempered
climate of the Middle East.

00:03:13.834 --> 00:03:17.500
With an average range of
500 to 1,000 millimeters

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.291
of rain fall, and a
sunny warm summer,

00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:25.333
too much precipitation
may lead to crop diseases.

00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:28.083
Outside the Middle East region,

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:31.208
the most famous place in
the world that cultivates it

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:36.125
on a large scale is Montana
in the United States.

00:03:36.417 --> 00:03:40.999
Khorasan wheat first reached
the United States in 1949.

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:44.583
But it didn't make any
impact among American farmers

00:03:44.583 --> 00:03:49.542
until in 1977 when two
farmers from Montana,

00:03:49.542 --> 00:03:52.917
Mack and Bob Quinn,
rediscovered it

00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:56.166
and decided to start
cultivating it.

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:59.375
They succeeded and
eventually in 1990

00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:05.000
they registered their cultivated
turanicum variety QK-77

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.208
as the trademark Kamut.

00:04:09.667 --> 00:04:11.999
When asked if they
know khorasan wheat,

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:14.500
many people would
probably say no.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.999
But in truth, they know it.

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:20.875
They just call it by a
different name, which is Kamut.

00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:25.291
It must be noted that
Kamut is a brand name.

00:04:25.875 --> 00:04:27.999
(soft music)

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.291
Compared to other
major ancient grains

00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:37.250
khorasan wheat is
relatively unknown.

00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:46.625
But with a gradual rise in
popularity of whole grains

00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:49.999
it is an auspicious
era for khorasan wheat.

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:53.959
And it will have it's
moment in the sun.

00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:57.208
(soft piano)

00:05:07.041 --> 00:05:09.291
(upbeat music)

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:20.999
Wheat is a global
cereal favorite

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:23.542
because of it's
nutritional profile.

00:05:23.542 --> 00:05:25.709
But it's values differ depending

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:28.667
on it's species or varieties.

00:05:28.667 --> 00:05:30.999
As a relative of
wheat, khorasan wheat

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:35.417
also boasts of a very
impressive nutrient mineral

00:05:35.417 --> 00:05:37.999
and vitamin composition.

00:05:38.041 --> 00:05:40.291
A quarter cup of khorasan wheat

00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:44.500
contains 27.91 grams
of carbohydrates.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.999
6.81 grams of protein,
which is 30 percent higher

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:51.041
compared to common wheat.

00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:54.667
And 5.25 grams of fiber.

00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:57.000
For it's vitamin
content a quarter cup

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.166
has the following values,
.02 milligrams of folic acid,

00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:07.959
.18 milligrams of vitamin B1,

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:11.959
3.02 milligrams of vitamin B3,

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:16.125
and 37 milligrams of vitamin E.

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:17.999
When it comes to it's minerals

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:20.999
it has the following
significant values

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:27.041
38.41 milligrams of Silicon,
1.44 milligrams of Zinc,

00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:33.917
9.39 milligrams of Calcium,
1.73 milligrams of Iron,

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:40.041
.08 milligrams of Selenium,
1.49 milligrams of Manganese,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.166
2.45 milligrams of Sodium,
64.03 milligrams of Magnesium,

00:06:49.083 --> 00:06:53.417
143.78 milligrams of Phosphorus,

00:06:53.417 --> 00:06:59.291
and an impressive 192.74
milligrams of Potassium.

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:02.999
Like most whole
grains, khorasan wheat

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:05.208
can reduce metabolic
risk factors

00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:09.000
by lowering cholesterol
and blood sugar levels.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.250
This is according
to a study published

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.834
in the European Journal
of Clinical Nutrition

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:17.999
in February 2013.

00:07:18.542 --> 00:07:22.333
The Calcium, Magnesium,
Phosphorus, and Silicon

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:25.458
in khorasan wheat
can greatly benefit

00:07:25.458 --> 00:07:27.083
the body's overall bone health.

00:07:27.083 --> 00:07:31.166
Including prevention of
different kinds of arthritis

00:07:31.166 --> 00:07:33.667
as well as osteoporosis.

00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:35.999
Especially among women.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.999
Khorasan wheat's Potassium
offers a wide array of benefits

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:43.125
that promote well being.

00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:46.291
Potassium acts as the
body's electrolyte

00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:48.333
maintaining smooth transmission

00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:51.250
of electric charges
throughout the body.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.750
Thus promoting better
brain function.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.999
Hypoglycemic people who
often experience headaches

00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:00.125
when their blood
sugar level drops

00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:03.250
can find immediate
relief from the intake

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.917
of Potassium and Sodium.

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:09.375
Which are both found
abundantly in khorasan wheat.

00:08:10.375 --> 00:08:13.999
It's high Potassium
content is also ideal

00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:15.959
in maintaining
muscular strength.

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:20.291
Because this mineral is needed
for proper muscle contraction

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.333
and relaxation movements.

00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:27.083
Eating khorasan wheat can
alleviate muscle cramps.

00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:30.999
A quarter cup of khorasan wheat

00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:34.583
also has 26.74 grams of starch.

00:08:34.583 --> 00:08:38.208
But unlike the starches of
durum and other wheat varieties

00:08:38.208 --> 00:08:43.250
khorasan wheat's starch is
two times more resistant.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.917
Resistant starch, also
found in oats and corn

00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:50.417
is basically a starch
that resists digestion

00:08:50.417 --> 00:08:53.041
and is eventually
fermented by bacteria

00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:56.999
commonly found in
the large intestine.

00:08:57.083 --> 00:09:01.166
This fermentation then produces
short chain fatty acids,

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:04.583
like acetate, butyrate
and propionate

00:09:04.583 --> 00:09:08.917
that can be associated with
specific health benefits.

00:09:08.917 --> 00:09:11.083
Such as, improved cholesterol,

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:14.917
blood sugar levels,
and satiation.

00:09:15.999 --> 00:09:19.500
Khorasan wheat is also a
good source of Selenium.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.999
A mineral famous for it's
antioxidant properties.

00:09:23.999 --> 00:09:26.000
Selenium is needed by the body

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.500
to maintain thyroid and
cognitive functions.

00:09:30.834 --> 00:09:32.875
(soft piano)

00:09:39.166 --> 00:09:40.500
Because of the re-emergence

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.750
of this grain in
the modern market

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.166
there is another exciting
whole grain variety

00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:51.208
for people who are in search
of healthy organic options.

00:09:51.583 --> 00:09:54.500
(soft piano)

00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:10.333
(upbeat music)

00:10:21.999 --> 00:10:23.750
Most grains of the ancient world

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.999
acquire different
names or monikers

00:10:25.999 --> 00:10:28.999
as they traveled from
their place of origin

00:10:28.999 --> 00:10:32.500
across oceans to new lands.

00:10:41.125 --> 00:10:43.834
For example, South
America's maize

00:10:43.834 --> 00:10:47.667
became popular in
Europe as corn.

00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:57.917
Middle East Spelt is
more commonly known
in Italy as farro.

00:11:02.583 --> 00:11:06.999
Khorasan wheat is also
called by many names.

00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:12.250
While it is named after a great

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.250
Persian province called Khorasan

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:19.458
it is not definite that it
originated from that place.

00:11:23.375 --> 00:11:27.834
In the United States it
is called King Tuts wheat.

00:11:27.834 --> 00:11:28.999
Or Pharoah's wheat.

00:11:28.999 --> 00:11:30.834
Perhaps this is
because of a story

00:11:30.834 --> 00:11:33.083
that the first
khorasan wheat grains

00:11:33.083 --> 00:11:36.999
that reached America were
taken from a stone box

00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:40.500
in a tomb excavation in Egypt.

00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:51.834
In Turkey, it's
nicknamed camel's tooth

00:11:51.834 --> 00:11:57.208
because the grain's humpback
shape resembles camel's tooth.

00:12:00.999 --> 00:12:05.291
Khorasan wheat also has
the moniker prophet's wheat

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:06.792
because according to legends

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:10.291
Noah brought it
with him on the ark.

00:12:17.542 --> 00:12:19.999
Because cultivation
of khorasan wheat

00:12:19.999 --> 00:12:22.999
has been limited for a long time

00:12:25.999 --> 00:12:31.417
agriculturist haven't explored
it's uses beyond flour.

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:34.583
(upbeat music)

00:12:39.999 --> 00:12:41.542
Khorasan wheat flour is a great

00:12:41.542 --> 00:12:44.083
alternative to
common wheat flour.

00:12:44.083 --> 00:12:46.583
But because it doesn't
contain as much gluten

00:12:46.583 --> 00:12:50.375
as common wheat flour, it
usually requires the addition

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:54.625
of wheat gluten to give
baked goods structure.

00:12:58.999 --> 00:13:00.667
The story of khorasan wheat

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:03.917
is different compared
to other grades.

00:13:03.917 --> 00:13:08.583
Grades like barley,
quinoa, and maize

00:13:08.583 --> 00:13:11.208
manage to remain and
reestablish themselves

00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:13.792
in their homeland
as important crops

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:16.999
despite great odds and
other circumstances

00:13:16.999 --> 00:13:22.917
like colonization,
invasions, and war.

00:13:27.208 --> 00:13:30.999
The same can not be said
about khorasan wheat.

00:13:30.999 --> 00:13:33.250
Despite originating
from the Middle East

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.750
scientist now don't have
definite proof or data

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:41.999
to support that this ancient
grain still exists there.

00:13:45.542 --> 00:13:47.917
Some say that in the early 1900s

00:13:47.917 --> 00:13:51.792
most of the local farmers
abandoned khorasan wheat

00:13:51.792 --> 00:13:53.500
to grow common wheat instead.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:58.792
Resulting in it's eventual
disuse and disappearance.

00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:03.875
(soft piano)

00:14:12.458 --> 00:14:13.917
The story of khorasan wheat

00:14:13.917 --> 00:14:18.208
will serve as a lesson
to future generations.

00:14:27.999 --> 00:14:32.583
And that is preservation
is necessary.

00:14:39.917 --> 00:14:42.999
Whether it is a
small humble grain

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.000
or an enormous work of art.

00:14:48.875 --> 00:14:50.417
Protecting them is protecting

00:14:50.417 --> 00:14:53.959
an entire culture from oblivion.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.000
(upbeat music)

00:15:18.542 --> 00:15:21.375
From the ancient
cradle of civilization

00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:22.999
called the Fertile Crescent,

00:15:22.999 --> 00:15:26.458
sprung a diverse
taxonomy of grains.

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:29.250
Early cultivation
practices in that area

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.166
have resulted in the
production of a variety,

00:15:32.166 --> 00:15:36.999
sub varieties, and sub
species of some grains.

00:15:36.999 --> 00:15:39.959
Most of the grains
originating from this area

00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:42.667
have traveled to
different continents

00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:45.375
as early as the Bronze age.

00:15:45.375 --> 00:15:48.375
Except for khorasan wheat.

00:15:48.375 --> 00:15:50.999
Cultivation and
production of this grain

00:15:50.999 --> 00:15:53.125
was confined to the near east

00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:55.999
during most parts
of early history.

00:15:55.999 --> 00:15:58.458
But this doesn't mean
that khorasan wheat

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:03.291
doesn't have it's own share
of extraordinary stories.

00:16:03.834 --> 00:16:06.625
It crossed the Atlantic
ocean from Europe

00:16:06.625 --> 00:16:09.792
to the United States in 1949.

00:16:09.792 --> 00:16:11.999
A U.S. airman name Earl Dedman

00:16:11.999 --> 00:16:14.208
who was stationed in
Portugal at that time

00:16:14.208 --> 00:16:18.458
received 36 giant wheat
kernels from another airman

00:16:18.458 --> 00:16:23.041
who obtained them from a tomb
excavation site in Egypt.

00:16:23.041 --> 00:16:26.250
Dedman then sent these
kernels to his father

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:30.000
who lived in Fort
Benton, Montana U.S.A.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.709
His father Rue Dedman planted
the grains in their farm.

00:16:34.709 --> 00:16:39.750
32 out of the 36 kernels
successfully grew.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.999
The Dedman family
continued planting khorasan

00:16:42.999 --> 00:16:45.709
wheat for the next six years.

00:16:45.709 --> 00:16:48.375
Before retiring from
farming, Rue Dedman

00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:52.291
sold his 1,500 bushels
of khorasan wheat

00:16:52.291 --> 00:16:56.417
to a company that used
it as cattle feed.

00:16:58.083 --> 00:16:59.291
Dedman had retired.

00:16:59.291 --> 00:17:02.375
But another local farmer
named Bernard Cooper

00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:06.083
bought some seeds
from Dedman in 1956

00:17:06.083 --> 00:17:08.999
and decided to grow the grain.

00:17:08.999 --> 00:17:12.333
Another man who bought
six bushels from Dedman

00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:16.125
was a mail carrier
named, Neil Archer.

00:17:16.125 --> 00:17:17.917
Calling it King Tut's wheat,

00:17:17.917 --> 00:17:20.000
Archer gave the grain
to people he met

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.999
while he carried
out his mail duties.

00:17:22.999 --> 00:17:24.875
One summer, he
traveled to Florida

00:17:24.875 --> 00:17:28.999
spreading and giving the
grains to at least 1000 people

00:17:28.999 --> 00:17:31.375
from different
states like Florida,

00:17:31.375 --> 00:17:35.041
Kansas, Missouri,
Iowa, South Dakota,

00:17:35.041 --> 00:17:39.333
Texas, Alabama, and Washington.

00:17:39.542 --> 00:17:43.583
Unfortunately, despite
it's great start in Montana

00:17:43.583 --> 00:17:47.166
cultivation of khorasan
wheat was not sustained.

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:53.166
Until eventually it disappeared
around 1965 to 1976.

00:17:54.999 --> 00:18:00.250
In 1977, T. Mack Quinn,
another farmer from Montana

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.542
acquired a jar of
khorasan wheat.

00:18:02.542 --> 00:18:06.625
Together with his son Bob,
an agriculture scientist

00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:09.083
from the University
of California Davis

00:18:09.083 --> 00:18:13.999
spent the next years researching
on and breeding the grains.

00:18:13.999 --> 00:18:17.291
Their efforts to discover
the origins of the grains

00:18:17.291 --> 00:18:20.999
led them back to Egypt
when the U.S. airman

00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:23.250
obtained the first
khorasan grains

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.375
that traveled to
the United States.

00:18:26.375 --> 00:18:29.959
Though khorasan wheat
was widely grown in Egypt

00:18:29.959 --> 00:18:32.166
it is still inconclusive
whether or not

00:18:32.166 --> 00:18:34.999
it is where the grains
truly originate.

00:18:34.999 --> 00:18:37.999
The father, son tandem
continued cultivating

00:18:37.999 --> 00:18:40.792
and breeding it
until when in 1990

00:18:40.792 --> 00:18:43.750
they decided to
register the name Kamut

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:48.291
as a brand of khorasan wheat
with specific attribute.

00:18:48.291 --> 00:18:52.458
Kamut is an ancient
Egyptian word meaning wheat.

00:18:52.458 --> 00:18:55.000
Since it belongs to
already dead language

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.959
the Quinns were allowed to
register it as a trademark.

00:19:00.917 --> 00:19:04.999
Today khorasan wheat
is still widely planted

00:19:04.999 --> 00:19:06.709
and harvested in Montana.

00:19:06.709 --> 00:19:09.875
As well as in some areas
within North Dakota,

00:19:09.875 --> 00:19:13.999
and Alberta, and
Saskatchewan in Canada.

00:19:15.999 --> 00:19:18.834
The United States may
be the major player

00:19:18.834 --> 00:19:21.041
in khorasan wheat
production today.

00:19:21.041 --> 00:19:24.583
But Europe is the
wheat's largest market.

00:19:24.583 --> 00:19:28.166
As a great flour to process
into pasta and breads

00:19:28.166 --> 00:19:33.166
Italy is today's biggest
consumer of khorasan wheat.

00:19:36.166 --> 00:19:40.999
This grain may not be as
adaptable as it's wheat cousins

00:19:40.999 --> 00:19:43.458
in terms of cultivation.

00:19:46.375 --> 00:19:50.583
But it's potential to acquire
a modest yet stable share

00:19:50.583 --> 00:19:53.250
in the organic and
whole foods market

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.208
may outweigh some
of the drawbacks

00:19:55.208 --> 00:19:59.999
involved in it's
production in the long run.

00:20:07.917 --> 00:20:10.417
(upbeat music)

00:20:14.709 --> 00:20:19.041
It is true that many are
unfamiliar with khorasan wheat.

00:20:19.041 --> 00:20:21.500
But integration of
this ancient grain

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.500
into modern cuisine is
not really difficult.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.000
Like maize, it's grains
can be eaten directly

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.709
or it can be milled into flour.

00:20:31.709 --> 00:20:35.125
Those who have experimented
with khorasan wheat flour

00:20:35.125 --> 00:20:38.458
actually found it very
suitable for baking

00:20:38.458 --> 00:20:42.417
because of it's natural
buttery sweetness.

00:20:42.999 --> 00:20:45.999
Cooking khorasan
wheat may require time

00:20:45.999 --> 00:20:49.959
compared to other grains
like common wheat.

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:53.083
There are two ways
of cooking it.

00:20:53.417 --> 00:20:56.999
First cooking it the
conventional way, stove top.

00:20:56.999 --> 00:21:00.999
It is recommended that the
grains are soaked over night

00:21:00.999 --> 00:21:03.166
to reduce actual cooking time.

00:21:03.166 --> 00:21:06.500
Use one cup of
pre-soaked khorasan wheat

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.792
to three cups of water
and bring it to a boil.

00:21:10.792 --> 00:21:13.917
Once it's boiling you
can add a pinch of salt.

00:21:13.917 --> 00:21:19.500
Lower the heat and let
simmer for 40 to 45 minutes.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:23.208
The second way of
cooking khorasan wheat

00:21:23.208 --> 00:21:25.375
is using a pressure cooker.

00:21:25.375 --> 00:21:27.999
Many prefer this
method because one,

00:21:27.999 --> 00:21:30.709
soaking is not
necessary, and two,

00:21:30.709 --> 00:21:35.709
it only takes about 20 minutes
until the grains are tender.

00:21:35.709 --> 00:21:37.999
Cooking one cup of it
in a pressure cooker

00:21:37.999 --> 00:21:42.709
would only require one and
a half to two cups of water.

00:21:42.709 --> 00:21:44.208
Here are two recipes to give you

00:21:44.208 --> 00:21:47.750
a refreshing taste
of this whole grain.

00:21:47.999 --> 00:21:50.917
First, a simple
khorasan wheat salad.

00:21:50.917 --> 00:21:54.625
You will need two cups
of cooked khorasan wheat.

00:21:54.625 --> 00:21:56.166
One chopped orange.

00:21:56.166 --> 00:21:58.000
One large cubed red bell pepper.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.208
Six rinsed and chopped
sun dried tomatoes in oil.

00:22:02.208 --> 00:22:05.542
One thinly sliced red onion.

00:22:05.625 --> 00:22:07.583
One crushed clove of garlic.

00:22:07.583 --> 00:22:11.458
One de-seeded and
chopped fresh red chili.

00:22:11.458 --> 00:22:13.417
The juice of one lemon.

00:22:13.417 --> 00:22:15.750
Two tablespoons of olive oil.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.834
One teaspoon of sugar.

00:22:17.834 --> 00:22:20.500
And salt and pepper to taste.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.959
Prepare your khorasan wheat

00:22:21.959 --> 00:22:24.999
using any of the methods
discussed earlier.

00:22:24.999 --> 00:22:27.417
And let it cool for a while.

00:22:27.417 --> 00:22:29.417
Once it's cooled, just toss it

00:22:29.417 --> 00:22:33.291
and the rest of the ingredients
together in a large bowl.

00:22:33.291 --> 00:22:37.792
Then refrigerate it for a
few hours before serving.

00:22:37.792 --> 00:22:40.917
The second recipe you
can try is called,

00:22:40.917 --> 00:22:43.792
Read Bean and
Khorasan Wheat Soup.

00:22:43.792 --> 00:22:47.625
For this one, prepare the
following ingredients.

00:22:47.625 --> 00:22:49.917
One cup of khorasan wheat.

00:22:49.917 --> 00:22:53.041
Three tablespoons of
olive oil or butter.

00:22:53.041 --> 00:22:55.917
One medium diced onion.

00:22:55.917 --> 00:22:58.792
Three minced cloves of garlic.

00:22:58.792 --> 00:23:01.291
Six cups of vegetable stock.

00:23:01.291 --> 00:23:04.333
One and one half
cups of tomato puree.

00:23:04.333 --> 00:23:08.083
Two cans of 425
gram can of beans.

00:23:08.083 --> 00:23:10.500
Two tablespoons of chili powder.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.834
Two teaspoons of dried thyme.

00:23:12.834 --> 00:23:15.583
One half teaspoon
of cayenne pepper.

00:23:15.583 --> 00:23:17.458
Three bay leaves.

00:23:17.458 --> 00:23:19.625
And salt to taste.

00:23:19.625 --> 00:23:21.999
Make sure to soak the
grains over night.

00:23:21.999 --> 00:23:25.750
Then before cooking,
drain them very well.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:29.999
First, in a large pot
heat olive oil or butter.

00:23:29.999 --> 00:23:32.999
Saute the onion
until translucent.

00:23:32.999 --> 00:23:34.750
And then add garlic.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.500
Saute for at least a minute.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.208
Add the khorasan wheat and
the rest of the ingredients.

00:23:40.208 --> 00:23:43.125
Combine well, cover,
and then let it simmer

00:23:43.125 --> 00:23:46.792
for 40 minutes to one
hour over low heat.

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:51.959
Don't forget to remove the
bay leaves before serving.

00:23:52.625 --> 00:23:55.875
The uses of khorasan
wheat are as diverse

00:23:55.875 --> 00:23:57.999
and versatile as common wheat.

00:23:57.999 --> 00:24:00.917
So make sure to venture
into more cooking

00:24:00.917 --> 00:24:04.999
and baking adventures
with this wonder grain.

00:24:05.792 --> 00:24:08.583
(upbeat music)
