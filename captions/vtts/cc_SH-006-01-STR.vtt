00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:38.170


2
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.770
I come no more to make youlaugh:

3
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.070
things now, that bear aweighty

4
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.970
and a serious brow,

5
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.470
Sad, high, and working,full of state and woe,

6
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.030
Such noble scenes as drawthe eye to flow,

7
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.000
We now present.

8
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.130
Those that can pity, heremay,

9
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.400
if they think it well, letfall a tear;

10
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.930
The subject willdeserve it.

11
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.400
Such as give their moneyout of hope

12
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.070
they may believe,

13
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.700
May here find truth too.Those that come to see

14
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.030
Only a show or two, and soagree the play may pass,

15
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.070
if they be still andwilling,

16
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.300
I'll undertake may seeaway

17
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.130
their shilling richly intwo short hours.

18
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.930
Only they that come tohear a merry bawdy play,

19
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.600
A noise of targets,

20
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600
or to see a fellow

21
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.100
in a long motley coatguarded with yellow,

22
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.870
Will be deceived;

23
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.670
for, gentle hearers, know,

24
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.930
To rank our chosen truthwith such a show

25
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.230
As fool and fight is,

26
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.670
beside forfeiting our ownbrains,

27
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.030
and the opinion that webring,

28
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.430
to make that only true wenow intend,

29
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.230
will leave us never anunderstanding friend.

30
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.130
Therefore, for goodness'sake,

31
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.770
and as you are known thefirst

32
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.670
and happiest hearers ofthe town,

33
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.200
Be sad, as we would makeye:

34
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.600
think ye see the verypersons of our noble story

35
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.730
As they were living;

36
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.970
think you see them great,

37
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.600
And follow'd with thegeneral throng

38
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.100
and sweat of thousandfriends; then in a moment,

39
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.700
see how soon thismightiness meets misery:

40
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.630
And, if you can be merrythen, I'll say

41
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.630
A man may weep upon hiswedding-day.

42
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.400
Good morrow, and well met.

43
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.630
How have ye done sincelast we saw in France?

44
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.700
I thank your grace,

45
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.970
Healthful; and ever sincea fresh admirer

46
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.170
of what I saw there.

47
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.000
An untimely ague stay'd mea prisoner in my chamber

48
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.730
when those suns of glory,those two lights of men,

49
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.970
Met in the vale of Andren.

50
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.330
'Twixt Guynes and Arde:

51
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.800
I was then present, sawthem salute on horseback;

52
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.030
Beheld them, when theylighted,

53
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.700
how they clung in theirembracement,

54
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.170
as they grew together;

55
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.870
Which had they, what fourthroned ones

56
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.130
could have weigh'd such acompounded one?

57
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.600
All the whole time I wasmy chamber's prisoner.

58
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.700
Then you lost the view ofearthly glory:

59
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.430
men might say,

60
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.330
Till this time pomp wassingle,

61
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.530
but now married to oneabove itself.

62
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.930
Each following day becamethe next day's master,

63
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.600
till the last made formerwonders its.

64
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.100
To-day the French,

65
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.870
All clinquant, all ingold, like heathen gods,

66
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.170
Shone down the English;and, to-morrow,

67
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.470
they made Britain India:

68
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.030
every man that stoodshow'd like a mine.

69
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.670
Their dwarfish pages wereas cherubins, all guilt:

70
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.070
The two kings, equal inlustre,

71
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.430
were now best, now worst,

72
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.730
As presence did presentthem; him in eye,

73
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.130
Still him in praise: and,being present both

74
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.830
'Twas said they saw butone;

75
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.430
and no discerner durst waghis tongue in censure.

76
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.670
When these suns-- for sothey phrase 'em--

77
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.570
by their heralds challengedthe noble spirits to arms,

78
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.370
they did perform beyondthought's compass

79
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.030
O, you go far.

80
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.600
As I belong to worship andaffect in honour honesty,

81
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.530
the tract of every thing

82
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.400
would by a good discourserlose some life,

83
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.730
Which action's self wastongue to.

84
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.470
All was royal;

85
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.130
to the disposing of itnought rebell'd.

86
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.170
Order gave each thingview;

87
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.070
the office did distinctlyhis full function.

88
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.970
Who did guide,

89
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.500
I mean, who set the bodyand the limbs

90
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.400
Of this great sporttogether, as you guess?

91
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.470
One, certes, that promisesno element

92
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.870
in such a business.

93
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.670
I pray you, who, my lord?

94
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.230
All this was order'd bythe good discretion

95
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.900
Of the right reverendCardinal of York.

96
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.770
The devil speed him!

97
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.270
no man's pie is freed fromhis ambitious finger.

98
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.300
What had he to do in thesefierce vanities?

99
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.870
I wonder that such a keechcan with his very bulk

100
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.770
Take up the rays o' thebeneficial sun

101
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.730
and keep it from theearth.

102
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:08.830
Surely, sir,

103
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.530
There's in him stuff thatputs him to these ends;

104
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.570
For, being not propp'd byancestry,

105
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.730
whose grace chalkssuccessors their way,

106
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.630
nor call'd upon for highfeats done to the crown;

107
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.030
neither allied for eminentassistants;

108
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.100
but, spider-like,

109
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.370
Out of his self-drawingweb, he gives us note,

110
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.800
The force of his own meritmakes his way

111
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.330
A gift that heaven givesfor him,

112
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.100
which buys a place next tothe king.

113
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.200
I cannot tell what heavenhath given him,

114
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.900
--let some graver eyepierce into that;

115
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.770
but I can see his pride peepthrough each part of him:

116
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.630
whence has he that, if notfrom hell?

117
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.870
the devil is a niggard,

118
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.400
Or has given all before,

119
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.430
and he begins a new hellin himself.

120
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.430
Why the devil,

121
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.630
Upon this French goingout, took he upon him,

122
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:49.870
Without the privity o' theking,

123
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.000
to appoint who shouldattend on him?

124
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.830
He makes up the file ofall the gentry;

125
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.970
for the most part such towhom

126
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.530
as great a charge aslittle honour

127
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.630
He meant to lay upon:

128
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.770
I do know Kinsmen of mine,three at the least,

129
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.800
that have by this sosickened their estates,

130
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.830
that never they shallabound as formerly.

131
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.470
O, many have broke theirbacks

132
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.800
with laying manors on 'em

133
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.630
For this great journey.

134
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.470
Grievingly I think, the peacebetween the French and us

135
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.670
not values the cost thatdid conclude it.

136
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.830
Every man, after the hideousstorm that follow'd,

137
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.530
was a thing inspired; and,not consulting,

138
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.170
broke into a generalprophecy;

139
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:21.130
That this tempest,

140
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.700
Dashing the garment ofthis peace,

141
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.500
aboded the sudden breachon't.

142
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.500
Which is budded out;

143
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.170
For France hath flaw'd theleague,

144
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.100
and hath attach'd ourmerchants' goods at Bourdeaux.

145
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.930
Is it therefore theambassador is silenced?

146
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:31.830
Marry, is't.

147
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.470
A proper title of apeace;

148
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.300
and purchased at asuperfluous rate!

149
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.530
Why, all this business ourreverend cardinal carried.

150
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.600
Like it your grace,

151
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.370
The state takes notice ofthe private difference

152
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.000
Betwixt you and thecardinal.

153
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.800
I advise you-- And take itfrom a heart

154
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.100
that wishes towards youhonour and plenteous safety

155
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.700
--that you read thecardinal's malice

156
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.530
and his potency together;to consider further

157
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.900
that what his highhatred would effect

158
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.400
wants not a minister inhis power.

159
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.300
You know his nature, thathe's revengeful,

160
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.630
and I know his sword hatha sharp edge:

161
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.800
it's long and, 't may besaid, it reaches far,

162
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.570
and where 'twill not extend,thither he darts it.

163
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.300
Bosom up my counsel,you'll find it wholesome.

164
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.400
Lo, where comes that rockthat I advise your shunning.

165
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.670
The Duke of Buckingham'ssurveyor, ha?

166
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.330
Where's his examination?

167
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.100
Here, so please you.

168
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.300
Is he in person ready?

169
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.130
Ay, please your grace.

170
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.670
Well, we shall then knowmore;

171
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:45.070
and Buckingham shalllessen this big look.

172
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.530
This butcher's cur isvenom-mouth'd,

173
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.970
and I have not the powerto muzzle him;

174
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.570
therefore best not wakehim in his slumber.

175
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.170
A beggar's book outworthsa noble's blood.

176
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.070
What, are you chafed?

177
00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.430
Ask God for temperance;

178
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.630
that's the appliance onlywhich your disease requires.

179
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.500
I read in's looks matteragainst me;

180
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.730
and his eye reviled me, ashis abject object:

181
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.900
at this instant he boresme with some trick:

182
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.330
he's gone to the king; I'llfollow and outstare him.

183
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.230
Stay, my lord,

184
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.300
And let your reason withyour choler question

185
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.730
What 'tis you go about:

186
00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:31.400
to climb steep hillsrequires slow pace at first:

187
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.070
anger is like a full-hothorse,

188
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.100
who being allow'd his way,

189
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.600
Self-mettle tires him.

190
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.200
Not a man in England canadvise me like you:

191
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.130
be to yourself as youwould to your friend.

192
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.070
I'll to the king; and froma mouth of honour

193
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.630
quite cry down this Ipswichfellow's insolence;

194
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.830
or proclaim there'sdifference in no persons.

195
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:48.970
Be advised;

196
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.230
Heat not a furnace foryour foe

197
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.800
so hot that it do singeyourself:

198
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.730
we may outrun, by violentswiftness,

199
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:55.830
that which we run at,

200
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.730
And lose by over-running.

201
00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.030
Be advised: I say again,

202
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.870
there is no English soulmore stronger

203
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.570
to direct you thanyourself,

204
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.230
If with the sap of reasonyou would quench,

205
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.000
Or but allay, the fire ofpassion.

206
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.170
Sir, I am thankful to you;

207
00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.000
and I'll go along by yourprescription:

208
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.830
but this top-proud fellow,

209
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.770
whom from the flow of gallI name not

210
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.270
but from sincere motions,by intelligence,

211
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.730
And proofs as clear asfounts in July

212
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.700
when we see each grain ofgravel,

213
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.900
I do know to be corruptand treasonous.

214
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:23.930
Say not 'treasonous.'

215
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.330
To the king I'll say't;

216
00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.070
and make my vouch asstrong as shore of rock.

217
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.430
Attend. This holy fox, orwolf, or both,

218
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.200
--for he is equal ravenousas he is subtle,

219
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.130
and as prone to mischiefas able to perform't;

220
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.200
his mind and placeinfecting one another,

221
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.530
yea, reciprocally--

222
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:39.500
Only to show his pomp

223
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.300
as well in France as hereat home,

224
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.470
suggests the king ourmaster

225
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.130
to this last costlytreaty,

226
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.100
the interview, thatswallow'd so much treasure,

227
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.800
and like a glass did breaki' the rinsing.

228
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.730
Faith, and so it did.

229
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:49.730
Pray, give me favour, sir.

230
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:50.870
This cunning cardinal

231
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.370
The articles o' thecombination drew

232
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:53.500
as himself pleased;

233
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.630
and they were ratified ashe cried 'Thus let be':

234
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.400
to as much end as give acrutch to the dead:

235
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.000
Now this follows,-- which,as I take it,

236
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.630
is a kind of puppy to theold dam, treason,

237
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:04.570
--Charles the emperor,

238
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:06.400
under pretence to see thequeen his aunt--

239
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.570
For 'twas indeed hiscolour,

240
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.130
but he came to whisperWolsey,

241
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.530
--here makes visitation:

242
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.670
His fears were,

243
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.970
that the interview betwixtEngland and France might,

244
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.270
through their amity, breedhim some prejudice;

245
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.800
for from this league peep'dharms that menaced him:

246
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.570
he privily deals with ourcardinal; and, as I trow,--

247
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:21.630
Which I do well;

248
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.630
for I am sure the emperorpaid ere he promised;

249
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.130
whereby his suit wasgranted ere it was ask'd;

250
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.670
but when the way was made,and paved with gold,

251
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.200
the emperor thus desired,

252
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.130
that he would please toalter the king's course,

253
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.130
And break the foresaidpeace.

254
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:50.570
Let the king know,

255
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:51.700
As soon he shall by me,

256
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.830
that thus the cardinal doesbuy and sell his honour

257
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.830
as he pleases, and for hisown advantage.

258
00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.100
I am sorry to hear this ofhim;

259
00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.900
and could wish he weresomething mistaken in't.

260
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.170
No, not a syllable:

261
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.470
I do pronounce him in thatvery shape

262
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.400
he shall appear in proof.

263
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.170
Your office, sergeant;execute it.

264
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.770
Sir, my lord the Duke ofBuckingham,

265
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.800
and Earl of Hereford,Stafford, and Northampton,

266
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.870
I arrest thee of hightreason,

267
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.430
in the name of our mostsovereign king.

268
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.030
Lo, you, my lord,

269
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.530
The net has fall'n uponme!

270
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:29.270
I shall perish underdevice and practise.

271
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.830
I am sorry to see youta'en from liberty,

272
00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.570
to look on the businesspresent:

273
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.600
'tis his highness'pleasure

274
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.430
You shall to the Tower.

275
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.370
It will help me nothing toplead mine innocence;

276
00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:39.700
for that dye is on me

277
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.700
which makes my whitestpart black.

278
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.330
The will of heaven be donein this and all things!

279
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.430
I obey.

280
00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.430
O my LordAbergavenny, fare you well!

281
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.600
Nay, he must bear youcompany.

282
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.370
The king is pleased youshall to the Tower,

283
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.800
till you know how hedetermines further.

284
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.500
As the duke said, the willof heaven be done,

285
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.070
and the king's pleasure byme obey'd!

286
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:04.670
Here is a warrant from theking

287
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.830
to attach Lord Montacute;

288
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.500
and the bodies of theduke's confessor,

289
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.400
John de la Car,

290
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.400
One Gilbert Peck, hischancellor--

291
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.870
So, so; These are thelimbs o' the plot:

292
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.030
no more, I hope.

293
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.000
A monk o' the Chartreux.

294
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.970
O, Nicholas Hopkins?

295
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.570
He.

296
00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.730
My surveyor is false;

297
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:30.330
the o'er-great cardinalhath show'd him gold;

298
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.200
my life is spann'dalready:

299
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.830
I am the shadow of poorBuckingham,

300
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.570
Whose figure even thisinstant cloud puts on,

301
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.330
by darkening my clear sun.

302
00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.270
My lord, farewell.

303
00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.930
My life itself, and thebest heart of it,

304
00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.870
Thanks you for this greatcare:

305
00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:03.200
I stood i' the level of afull-charged confederacy,

306
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.430
and give thanks to youthat choked it.

307
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:09.100
Let be call'd before us thatgentleman of Buckingham's;

308
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.930
in person I'll hear himhis confessions justify;

309
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.470
And point by point thetreasons

310
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.570
of his master he shallagain relate.

311
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.800
'Room for the Queen!'

312
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.830
Nay, we must longer kneel:I am a suitor.

313
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.570
Arise, and take place byus:

314
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.170
half your suit never nameto us;

315
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.200
you have half our power:the other moiety,

316
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.830
ere you ask, is given;

317
00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.770
Repeat your will andtake it.

318
00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.570
Thank your majesty.

319
00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.830
That you would loveyourself,

320
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.330
and in that love notunconsider'd

321
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:03.130
leave your honour,

322
00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:04.800
nor the dignity of youroffice,

323
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.200
is the point of mypetition.

324
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.900
Lady mine, proceed.

325
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.670
I am solicited, not by afew,

326
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.930
And those of truecondition,

327
00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.570
that your subjects are ingreat grievance:

328
00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.470
there have been commissionssent down among 'em,

329
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.930
which hath flaw'd the heartof all their loyalties:

330
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.670
wherein, although, my goodlord cardinal,

331
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.200
they vent reproaches mostbitterly on you,

332
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.870
as putter on of theseexactions,

333
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:31.170
yet the king our master

334
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.630
-- whose honour heavenshield from soil!

335
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.830
--even he escapes notlanguage unmannerly,

336
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.530
yea, such which breaks thesides of loyalty,

337
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.130
and almost appears in loudrebellion.

338
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.800
Not almost appears,

339
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.600
It doth appear; for, uponthese taxations,

340
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.030
The clothiers all,

341
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.430
not able to maintain themany to them longing,

342
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.730
have put off thespinsters,

343
00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.970
carders, fullers, weavers,who,

344
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.400
Unfit for other life,

345
00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.070
compell'd by hunger andlack of other means,

346
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.130
in desperate manner daringthe event to the teeth,

347
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.500
are all in uproar, anddanger serves among then!

348
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.930
Taxation! Wherein? andwhat taxation?

349
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:09.870
My lord cardinal,

350
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.330
You that are blamed for italike with us,

351
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.900
know you of this taxation?

352
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.630
Please you, sir,

353
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:14.830
I know but of a singlepart,

354
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:16.800
in aught pertains to thestate;

355
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.230
and front but in that file

356
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:20.370
where others tell stepswith me.

357
00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.570
No, my lord, You know nomore than others;

358
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.600
but you frame things thatare known alike;

359
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.470
which are not wholesome

360
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.800
to those which would notknow them,

361
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.030
and yet must perforce betheir acquaintance.

362
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.830
These exactions, whereof mysovereign would have note,

363
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.570
they are most pestilent tothe bearing;

364
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.530
and, to bear 'em, the backis sacrifice to the load.

365
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.300
They say they are devisedby you;

366
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.030
or else you suffer toohard an exclamation.

367
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.100
Still exaction! The natureof it?

368
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.930
in what kind, let's know,Is this exaction?

369
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.930
I am much too venturous intempting of your patience;

370
00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.400
but am bolden'd under yourpromised pardon.

371
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.430
The subjects' grief comesthrough commissions,

372
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:06.270
which compel from each thesixth part of his substance,

373
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.700
to be levied withoutdelay;

374
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.300
and the pretence for thisis named,

375
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.270
your wars in France:

376
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.600
this makes bold mouths:

377
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.400
tongues spit their dutiesout,

378
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.000
and cold hearts freezeallegiance in them;

379
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
their curses now livewhere their prayers did:

380
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.830
and it's come to pass,

381
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:23.700
this tractable obedienceis a slave

382
00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.300
to each incensed will.

383
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.130
I would your highness

384
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.270
would give it quickconsideration,

385
00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:29.700
for there is no primerbusiness.

386
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.270
By my life, this isagainst our pleasure.

387
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.100
And for me, I have nofurther gone in this

388
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.430
than by a single voice;

389
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.830
and that not pass'd me

390
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.530
but by learned approbationof the judges.

391
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.800
If I am Traduced byignorant tongues,

392
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.930
which neither know myfaculties nor person,

393
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.530
yet will be the chroniclesof my doing,

394
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.770
let me say 'tis but thefate of place,

395
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.430
and the rough brake thatvirtue must go through.

396
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.530
We must not stint ournecessary actions,

397
00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.330
in the fear to copemalicious censurers;

398
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.100
which ever, as ravenousfishes,

399
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.230
do a vessel follow that isnew-trimm'd,

400
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:09.030
but benefit no furtherthan vainly longing.

401
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.830
What we oft do best, bysick interpreters,

402
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.700
once weak ones, is Notours,

403
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.200
or not allow'd;

404
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.070
what worst, as oft,hitting a grosser quality,

405
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.070
is cried up for our bestact.

406
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.170
If we shall stand still,

407
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.400
In fear our motion will bemock'd or carp'd at,

408
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.800
We should take root herewhere we sit,

409
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.030
or sit state-statues only.

410
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.170
Things done well, and witha care,

411
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.000
exempt themselves fromfear;

412
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.270
Things done withoutexample,

413
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.000
in their issue are to befear'd.

414
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.470
Have you a precedent ofthis commission?

415
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.600
I believe, not any.

416
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.000
We must not rend oursubjects from our laws,

417
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.430
And stick them in ourwill.

418
00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:02.200
Sixth part of each? Atrembling contribution!

419
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.170
Why, we take from everytree lop, bark,

420
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:05.570
and part o' the timber;

421
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.870
And, though we leave itwith a root, thus hack'd,

422
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.500
The air will drink thesap.

423
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:12.870
To every county where thisis question'd

424
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.130
send our letters, withfree pardon

425
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.530
to each man that hasdenied the force

426
00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:16.530
of this commission:

427
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.570
pray, look to't; I put itto your care.

428
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.000
A word with you.

429
00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.700
Let there be letters writto every shire,

430
00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.470
Of the king's grace andpardon.

431
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.930
The grieved commons hardlyconceive of me;

432
00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.330
let it be noised thatthrough our intercession

433
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.730
this revokement and pardoncomes:

434
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.100
I shall anon advise youfurther in the proceeding.

435
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:51.870
I am sorry that the Dukeof Buckingham

436
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:53.870
is run in yourdispleasure.

437
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.870
It grieves many:

438
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.900
The gentleman is learn'd,and a most rare speaker;

439
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.370
To nature none more bound;

440
00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.030
his training such, that hemay furnish

441
00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.300
and instruct greatteachers,

442
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.130
And never seek for aid outof himself.

443
00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.270
Yet see, when these sonoble benefits

444
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.770
shall prove not welldisposed,

445
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.030
the mind growing oncecorrupt,

446
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.400
They turn to viciousforms,

447
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.400
ten times more ugly thanever they were fair.

448
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.000
This man so complete,

449
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.670
who was enroll'd 'mongstwonders,

450
00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:23.700
and when we, almost withravish'd listening,

451
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.870
could not find his hour ofspeech a minute;

452
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.200
he, my lady, hath intomonstrous habits

453
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.730
put the graces that oncewere his,

454
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.400
and is become as black asif besmear'd in hell.

455
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.770
Sit by us; you shallhear--

456
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.670
This was his gentleman intrust--

457
00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:43.430
of him things to strikehonour sad.

458
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.470
Bid him recount thefore-recited practises;

459
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.670
whereof we cannot feel toolittle, hear too much.

460
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.100
Stand forth, and with boldspirit relate

461
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.830
what you, most like acareful subject,

462
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.830
have collected out of theDuke of Buckingham.

463
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.330
Speak freely.

464
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:05.070
First, it was usual withhim,

465
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.730
every day it would infecthis speech,

466
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.930
that if the king shouldwithout issue die,

467
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.600
he'll carry it so to makethe sceptre his:

468
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.700
these very words I'veheard him utter

469
00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.900
to his son-in-law,Lord Abergavenny;

470
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.030
to whom by oath he menacedrevenge upon the cardinal.

471
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.230
Please your highness,

472
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.370
note this dangerousconception in this point.

473
00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.170
Not friended by by hiswish,

474
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.700
to your high person hiswill is most malignant;

475
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.170
and it stretches beyondyou, to your friends.

476
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.900
My learn'd lord cardinal,deliver all with charity.

477
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.930
Speak on:

478
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.830
How grounded he his titleto the crown,

479
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:44.630
upon our fail?

480
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:45.670
to this point hast thouheard him

481
00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.630
at any time speak aught?

482
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:48.530
He was brought to this

483
00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.270
by a vain prophecy ofNicholas Henton.

484
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.530
What was that Henton?

485
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:54.900
Sir, a Chartreux friar,His confessor,

486
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.600
who fed him every minutewith words of sovereignty.

487
00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.030
How know'st thou this?

488
00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.530
Not long before yourhighness sped to France,

489
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.300
The duke being at theRose,

490
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.470
within the parish SaintLawrence Poultney,

491
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:08.470
did of me demand what wasthe speech

492
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.530
among the Londoners concerningthe French journey:

493
00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.570
I replied, men fear'd theFrench

494
00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:17.530
would prove perfidious tothe king's danger.

495
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.600
Presently the duke said,'twas the fear, indeed;

496
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.830
and that he doubted'twould prove

497
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.270
the verity of certainwords

498
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:26.830
Spoke by a holy monk;'that oft,' says he,

499
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.230
'Hath sent to me, wishingme to permit

500
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.130
John de la Car, mychaplain,

501
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:35.400
a choice hour to hear fromhim a matter of some moment:

502
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.730
Whom after under theconfession's seal

503
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.170
He solemnly had sworn,

504
00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:42.070
that what he spoke my chaplainto no creature living,

505
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.830
but to me, should utter,

506
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:48.570
with demure confidencethis pausingly ensued:

507
00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.830
neither the king nor'sheirs,

508
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.670
Tell you the duke, shallprosper:

509
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.970
bid him strive to gain thelove o' the commonalty:

510
00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.170
the duke shall governEngland.'

511
00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:01.600
If I know you well,

512
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.930
You were the duke'ssurveyor,

513
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.570
and lost your office on thecomplaint o' the tenants:

514
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:06.500
take good heed you

515
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.200
charge not in your spleena noble person

516
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.100
And spoil your noblersoul:

517
00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.100
I say, take heed; Yes,heartily beseech you.

518
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.430
Let him on.

519
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:15.770
Go forward.

520
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.830
On my soul, I'll speak buttruth.

521
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.130
I told my lord the duke,

522
00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:24.100
by the devil's illusionsthe monk might be deceived;

523
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.330
and that 'twas dangerousfor him

524
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.070
to ruminate on this sofar,

525
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.170
until it forged him somedesign,

526
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.100
which, being believed,

527
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.700
It was much like to do: heanswer'd, 'Tush,

528
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.500
It can do me no damage;'

529
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.870
adding further,

530
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.500
That, had the king in hislast sickness fail'd,

531
00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.800
The cardinal's and SirThomas Lovell's heads

532
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.200
should have gone off.

533
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.370
Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!

534
00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:49.530
There's mischief in thisman: canst thou say further?

535
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:50.700
I can, my liege.

536
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.670
Proceed.

537
00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:52.700
Being at Greenwich,

538
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.330
after your highness hadreproved the duke

539
00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:55.670
about Sir WilliamBlomer,--

540
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.830
I remember of such a time:being my sworn servant,

541
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.500
The duke retain'd him his.But on; what hence?

542
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.270
'If,' quoth he, 'I forthis had been committed,

543
00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.400
As, to the Tower, Ithought,

544
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.570
I would have play'd thepart my father meant to act

545
00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.300
upon the usurper Richard;

546
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.270
who, being at Salisbury,

547
00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.930
made suit to come in'spresence;

548
00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.470
which if granted, as hemade semblance of his duty,

549
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.530
would have put his knifeto him.'

550
00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:18.470
A giant traitor!

551
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:20.770
Now, madam, may hishighness live in freedom,

552
00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.230
and this man out ofprison?

553
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.030
God mend all!

554
00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.100
There's something more wouldout of thee; what say'st?

555
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.770
After 'the duke hisfather,' with 'the knife,'

556
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.430
He stretch'd him, and, withone hand on his dagger,

557
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.600
Another spread on'sbreast,

558
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.100
mounting his eyes he diddischarge a horrible oath;

559
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.800
whose tenor was,--were heevil used,

560
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.170
he would outgo his father

561
00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:42.600
by as much as aperformance

562
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.730
Does an irresolutepurpose.

563
00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:46.470
There's his period,

564
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.030
To sheathe his knife inus.

565
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.900
He is attach'd;

566
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.330
Call him to present trial:

567
00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.270
if he may find mercy inthe law, 'tis his:

568
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.300
if none, let himnot seek 't of us:

569
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.230
by day and night,

570
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.830
He's traitor to the height.

571
00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:10.670
Is't possible the spellsof France

572
00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:14.430
should juggle men intosuch strange mysteries?

573
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.470
New customs, though theybe never so ridiculous,

574
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:19.130
Nay, let 'em be unmanly,yet are follow'd.

575
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:20.470
Death! my lord, theirclothes are after

576
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:21.900
such a pagan cut too,

577
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.700
That, sure, they've wornout Christendom.

578
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.570
How now! What news, SirThomas Lovell?

579
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:27.670
Faith, my lord, I hear ofnone,

580
00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.030
but the new proclamation that'sclapp'd

581
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.200
upon the court-gate.

582
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.530
What is't for?

583
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.430
The reformation of ourtravell'd gallants,

584
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.770
That fill the court withquarrels, talk, and tailors.

585
00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.400
I'm glad 'tis there:

586
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.430
now I would pray ourmonsieurs

587
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.800
to think an Englishcourtier may be wise,

588
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.730
And never see the Louvre.

589
00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.670
They must either, for sorun the conditions,

590
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.030
leave those remnants offool and feather

591
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.070
that they got in France,

592
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.370
Or pack to their oldplayfellows:

593
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:54.800
there, I take it, theymay, 'cum privilegio,'

594
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.670
wear away the lag end of theirlewdness

595
00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:58.500
and be laugh'd at.

596
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.170
'Tis time to give 'emphysic,

597
00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:02.500
their diseases are grownso catching.

598
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.670
What a loss our ladies willhave of these trim vanities!

599
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.270
Ay, marry, There will bewoe indeed, lords:

600
00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.600
the sly whoresons have gota speeding trick

601
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.630
to lay down ladies;

602
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.730
A French song and a fiddlehas no fellow.

603
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.470
The devil fiddle 'em! I amglad they are going,

604
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.630
For, sure, there's noconverting of 'em:

605
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:21.570
now an honest countrylord, as I am,

606
00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:23.800
beaten a long time out ofplay,

607
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.670
may bring his plainsong andhave an hour of hearing;

608
00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:29.730
and, by'r lady, heldcurrent music too.

609
00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:30.900
Well said, Lord Sands;

610
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.430
Your colt's tooth is notcast yet.

611
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:36.630
No, my lord; Nor shallnot, while I have a stump.

612
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.130
Sir Thomas, whither wereyou a-going?

613
00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.300
To the cardinal's: Yourlordship is a guest too.

614
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.130
O, 'tis true: This nighthe makes a supper,

615
00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:45.070
and a great one, to manylords and ladies;

616
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.970
there will be the beautyof this kingdom,

617
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:48.030
I'll assure you.

618
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.630
That churchman bears abounteous mind indeed,

619
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:53.030
A hand as fruitful as theland that feeds us;

620
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:54.800
his dews fall every where.

621
00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.400
No doubt he's noble;

622
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.870
He had a black mouth thatsaid other of him.

623
00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:00.800
He may, my lord; haswherewithal:

624
00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.970
in him sparing would show aworse sin than ill doctrine:

625
00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.830
Men of his way should bemost liberal;

626
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:07.200
They are set here forexamples.

627
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.530
True, they are so: But fewnow give so great ones.

628
00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:13.800
My barge stays; Yourlordship shall along.

629
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.830
Come, good Sir Thomas, Weshall be late else;

630
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:17.630
which I would not be, forI was sent for,

631
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.330
with Sir Henry Guildford thisnight to be comptrollers.

632
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:21.800
I am your lordship's.

633
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:29.830
Ladies, a general welcome fromhis grace salutes ye all;

634

this night he dedicates tofair content and you:

635
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.100
none here, he hopes,

636
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.230
In all this noble bevy,

637
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.370
has brought with her one careabroad;

638
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:40.370
he would have all as merryas, first,

639
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:42.700
good company, good wine,good welcome,

640
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.730
can make good people.

641
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.030
O, my lord, you're tardy:

642
00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.000
The very thought of thisfair company

643
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.900
clapp'd wings to me.

644
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.300
You are young, Sir HarryGuildford.

645
00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:55.170
Sir Thomas Lovell,

646
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:58.400
had the cardinal but halfmy lay thoughts in him,

647
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.470
some of these should finda running banquet

648
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:01.700
ere they rested,

649
00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.100
I think would betterplease 'em:

650
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.900
by my life, they are asweet society of fair ones.

651
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.570
O, that your lordship werebut now confessor

652
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.130
to one or two of these!

653
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:15.100
I would I were they shouldfind easy penance.

654
00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.100
Faith, how easy?

655
00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.930
As easy as a down-bedwould afford it.

656
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:23.370
Sweet ladies, will itplease you sit?

657
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:24.770
Sir Harry, Place you thatside;

658
00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.930
I'll take the charge ofthis:

659
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.770
His grace is entering.Nay, you must not freeze;

660
00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:33.270
Two women placed togethermakes cold weather:

661
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:35.970
My Lord Sands, you are onewill keep 'em waking;

662
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:38.100
Pray, sit between theseladies.

663
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:41.670
By my faith, I thank yourlordship.

664
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.870
By your leave, sweetladies:

665
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.730
If I chance to talk alittle wild, forgive me;

666
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.270
I had it from my father.

667
00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.030
Was he mad, sir?

668
00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:53.570
O, very mad, exceedingmad, in love too:

669
00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:56.330
But he would bite none;just as I do now,

670
00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:58.570
He would kiss you twentywith a breath.

671
00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.030
You're welcome, my fairguests:

672
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.530

673
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:11.100
that is not freely merry,is not my friend: this,

674
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.830
to confirm my welcome; andto you all, good health.

675
00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.270
Your grace is noble:

676
00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.500
Let me have such a bowlmay hold my thanks,

677
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.800
And save me so muchtalking.

678
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.800
My Lord Sands,

679
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.800
I am beholding to you:cheer your neighbours.

680
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.930
Ladies, you are not merry:

681
00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:27.500
gentlemen, whose fault isthis?

682
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.770
The red wine first mustrise

683
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.800
in their fair cheeks, mylord;

684
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.230
then we shall have 'emtalk us to silence.

685
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:36.770
You are a merry gamester,my Lord Sands.

686
00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:38.970
Yes, if I make my play.

687
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:42.900
Here's to your ladyship:and pledge it, madam,

688
00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.230
For 'tis to such athing,--

689
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.830
You cannot show me.

690
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:47.530
I told your grace theywould talk anon.

691
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:50.530
(boom)

692
00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:51.530
What's that?

693
00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:53.830
Look out there, some ofye.

694
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:56.570
What warlike voice, and towhat end is this?

695
00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:57.600
Nay, ladies, fear not;

696
00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.100
by all the laws of waryou're privileged.

697
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.100
How now! what is't?

698
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.000
A noble troop ofstrangers;

699
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.200
For so they seem:

700
00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.130
they've left their bargeand landed;

701
00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:24.570
And hither make,

702
00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:27.170
as great ambassadors fromforeign princes.

703
00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:29.000
Good lord chamberlain, Go,give 'em welcome;

704
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.070
you can speak the Frenchtongue;

705
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:32.370
And, pray, receive 'emnobly,

706
00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:33.730
and conduct 'em into ourpresence,

707
00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:34.730
where this heaven ofbeauty

708
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:37.030
shall shine at full uponthem.

709
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:38.030
Some attend him.

710
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:46.130
You have now a brokenbanquet; but we'll mend it.

711

A good digestion to youall:

712

A noble company! what aretheir pleasures?

715
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:40.230
Because they speak noEnglish,

716
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:41.600
