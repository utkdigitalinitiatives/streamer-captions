00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.570


2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.670
Thursday, sir? the time is veryshort.

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.670
My father Capulet willhave it so;

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.870
And I am nothing slow toslack his haste.

5
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.370
You say you do not knowthe lady's mind:

6
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.270
Uneven is the course, Ilike it not.

7
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.870
Immoderately she weeps forTybalt's death,

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.330
And therefore have Ilittle talk'd of love;

9
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.870
For Venus smiles not in ahouse of tears.

10
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.930
Now, sir, her fathercounts it dangerous

11
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.570
That she do give hersorrow so much sway,

12
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.030
And in his wisdom hastesour marriage,

13
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.500
To stop the inundation ofher tears;

14
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.600
Which, too much minded byherself alone,

15
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.270
May be put from her bysociety:

16
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.300
Now do you know the reasonof this haste.

17
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.600
I would I knew not why itshould be slow'd.

18
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.100
Look, sir, here comes thelady toward my cell.

19
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.170
Happily met, my lady andmy wife!

20
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.430
That may be, sir, when Imay be a wife.

21
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.930
That may be must be, love,on Thursday next.

22
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.630
What must be shall be.

23
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.900
That's a certain text.

24
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.630
Come you to makeconfession to this father?

25
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.600
To answer that, I shouldconfess to you.

26
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.670
Do not deny to him thatyou love me.

27
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.570
I will confess to you thatI love him.

28
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.930
So will ye, I am sure,that you love me.

29
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.300
If I do so, it will be ofmore price,

30
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.300
Being spoke behind yourback, than to your face.

31
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.070
Are you at leisure, holyfather, now;

32
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.530
Or shall I come to you atevening mass?

33
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.400
My leisure serves me,pensive daughter, now.

34
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.000
My lord, we must entreatthe time alone.

35
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.200
God shield I shoulddisturb devotion!

36
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.930
Juliet, on Thursday earlywill I rouse ye:

37
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.270
Till then, adieu; and keepthis holy kiss.

38
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.300
O shut the door! and whenthou hast done so,

39
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.330
Come weep with me; pasthope, past cure, past help!

40
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.000
Ah, Juliet, I already knowthy grief;

41
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.770
It strains me past thecompass of my wits:

42
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.430
I hear thou must, andnothing may prorogue it,

43
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.470
On Thursday next bemarried to this county.

44
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.970
Tell me not, friar, thatthou hear'st of this,

45
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.570
Unless thou tell me how Imay prevent it:

46
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.930
If, in thy wisdom, thoucanst give no help,

47
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.700
Do thou but call myresolution wise,

48
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.970
And with this knife I'llhelp it presently.

49
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.670
God join'd my heart andRomeo's, thou our hands;

50
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.200
And ere this hand, by theeto Romeo seal'd,

51
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.600
Shall be the label toanother deed,

52
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.800
Or my true heart withtreacherous revolt

53
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.300
Turn to another, thisshall slay them both:

54
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.870
Therefore, out of thylong-experienced time,

55
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.800
Give me some presentcounsel, or, behold,

56
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.770
'Twixt my extremes and methis bloody knife

57
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.270
Shall play the umpire,arbitrating that

58
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.170
Which the commission ofthy years and art

59
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.000
Could to no issue of truehonour bring.

60
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.230
Be not so long to speak; Ilong to die,

61
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.870
If what thou speak'stspeak not of remedy.

62
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.870
Hold, daughter: I do spy akind of hope,

63
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.870
Which craves as desperatean execution

64
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.770
As that is desperate whichwe would prevent.

65
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.730
If, rather than to marryCounty Paris,

66
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.600
Thou hast the strength ofwill to slay thyself,

67
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.530
Then is it likely thouwilt undertake

68
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.500
A thing like death tochide away this shame.

69
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.470
O, bid me leap, ratherthan marry Paris,

70
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.330
From off the battlementsof any tower;

71
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.300
Or walk in thievish ways;or bid me lurk

72
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.500
Where serpents are; chainme with roaring bears;

73
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.030
Or hide me nightly in acharnel-house,

74
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.130
O'er-cover'd quite withdead men's rattling bones,

75
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.800
With reeky shanks andyellow chapless skulls;

76
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.970
Or bid me go into anew-made grave

77
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.200
And hide me with a deadman in his shroud;

78
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.870
Things that, to hear themtold, have made me tremble;

79
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.130
And I will do it withoutfear or doubt,

80
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.330
To live an unstain'd wifeto my sweet love.

81
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.270
Hold, then; go home, bemerry, give consent

82
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.930
To marry Paris: Wednesdayis to-morrow:

83
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.430
To-morrow night look thatthou lie alone;

84
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.930
Let not thy nurse lie withthee in thy chamber:

85
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.900
Take thou this vial, beingthen in bed,

86
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.500
And this distilled liquordrink thou off;

87
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.200
When presently through allthy veins shall run

88
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.970
A cold and drowsy humour,for no pulse

89
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.930
Shall keep his nativeprogress, but surcease:

90
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.900
No warmth, no breath,shall testify thou livest;

91
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.970
The roses in thy lips andcheeks shall fade

92
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.630
To paly ashes, thy eyes'windows fall,

93
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.200
Like death, when he shutsup the day of life;

94
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.270
Each part, deprived ofsupple government,

95
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.630
Shall, stiff and stark andcold, appear like death:

96
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.830
And in this borrow'dlikeness of shrunk death

97
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.700
Shalt thou continue twoand forty hours,

98
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.400
And then awake as from apleasant sleep.

99
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.000
Now, when the bridegroomin the morning comes

100
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.630
To rouse thee from thybed, there art thou dead:

101
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.230
Then, as the manner of ourcountry is,

102
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.800
In thy best robesuncover'd on the bier

103
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.470
Thou shalt be borne tothat same ancient vault

104
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.230
Where all the kindred ofthe Capulets lie.

105
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.530
In the mean time,

106
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.130
Shall Romeo by my lettersknow our drift,

107
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.900
And hither shall he come:and he and I

108
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.830
Will watch thy waking, andthat very night

109
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.900
Shall Romeo bear theehence to Mantua.

110
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.800
And this shall free theefrom this present shame;

111
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.870
If no inconstant toy, norwomanish fear,

112
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.870
Abate thy valour in theacting it.

113
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.100
O give me, give me!

114
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.900
O, tell not me of fear!

115
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.030
Hold; get you gone, bestrong and prosperous

116
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.800
In this resolve: I'll senda friar with speed

117
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.670
To Mantua, with my lettersto thy lord.

118
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.170
Love give me strength! andstrength shall help afford.

119
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.370
Farewell, dear father!

120
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.400
Samson!

121
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.030
My fan.

122
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.430
Before, and at pace.

123
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.270
How now, my headstrong!where have you beengadding?

124
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.570
Where I have learn'd me torepent the sin

125
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.170
Of disobedient opposition

126
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.430
To you and your behests,and am enjoin'd

127
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.470
By holy Laurence to fallprostrate here,

128
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.770
To beg your pardon:pardon, I beseech you!

129
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.270
Henceforward I am everruled by you.

130
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.000
Send for the county; gotell him of this:

131
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.470
I'll have this knot knitup to-morrow morning.

132
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.100
I met the youthful lord atLaurence' cell;

133
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.570
And gave him what becomedlove I might,

134
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.730
Not step o'er the boundsof modesty.

135
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.930
Why, I am glad on't; thisis well: stand up:

136
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.400
This is as't should be.

137
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.000
Let me see the county;

138
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.170
Ay, marry, go, I say, andfetch him hither.

139
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.670
Now, afore God! thisreverend holy friar,

140
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.900
And all our whole city ismuch bound to him.

141
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.000
Nurse, will you go with meinto my closet,

142
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.170
To help me sort suchneedful ornaments

143
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.100
As you think fit tofurnish me to-morrow?

144
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.700
No, not till Thursday;there is time enough.

145
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.730
Go, nurse, go with her:we'll to church to-morrow.

146
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.900
We shall be short in ourprovisions:

147
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.170
'Tis now near night.

148
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.630
Tush, I will stir about,

149
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.330
And all things will bewell, I warrant thee, wife:

150
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.870
Go thou with Juliet, helpto deck up her;

151
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.970
I'll not to bed to-night;let me alone;

152
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.600
I'll play the housewifefor this once.

153
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.130
What, ho!

154
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.170
They are all forth.

155
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.770
Well, I will walk myself

156
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.600
To County Paris, andprepare up him

157
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.100
Against to-morrow: myheart is wondrous light,

158
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:03.000
Since this same waywardgirl is so reclaim'd.

159
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:13.530
Ay, those attires arebest: but, gentle nurse,

160
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.230
I pray thee, leave me tomy self to-night,

161
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.730
For I have need of manyorisons

162
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.300
To move the heavens tosmile upon my state,

163
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.000
Which, well thou know'st,is cross, and full of sin.

164
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.570
What, are you busy, ho?need you my help?

165
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.630
No, madam; we have cull'dnecessaries

166
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.830
As are behoveful for ourstate to-morrow:

167
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.770
So please you, let me nowbe left alone,

168
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.930
And let the nurse thisnight sit up with you;

169
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:39.230
For, I am sure, you haveyour hands full all,

170
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.900
In this so suddenbusiness.

171
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.000
Good night:

172
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.370
Get thee to bed, and rest;for thou hast need.

173
00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.770
Farewell!

174
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.970
God knows when we shallmeet again.

175
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.500
I have a faint cold fearthrills through my veins,

176
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.430
That almost freezes up theheat of life:

177
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:16.630
I'll call them back againto comfort me: Nurse!

178
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:25.900
What should she do here?

179
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.530
My dismal scene I needsmust act alone.

180
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.930
Come, vial.

181
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.530
What if this mixture donot work at all?

182
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.670
Shall I be married thento-morrow morning?

183
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:50.600
No, no: this shall forbidit: lie thou there.

184
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.600
What if it be a poison,which the friar

185
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.970
Subtly hath minister'd tohave me dead,

186
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.300
Lest in this marriage hebe dishonour'd,

187
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.770
Because he married mebefore to Romeo?

188
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:09.970
I fear it is: and yet,methinks, it should not,

189
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:13.400
For he hath still beentried a holy man.

190
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.830
How if, when I am laidinto the tomb,

191
00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.630
I wake before the timethat Romeo

192
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:25.000
Come to redeem me? there'sa fearful point!

193
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.070
Shall I not, then, bestifled in the vault,

194
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.300
To whose foul mouth nohealthsome air breathes in,

195
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.630
And there die strangledere my Romeo comes?

196
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:37.400
Or, if I live, is it notvery like,

197
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.900
The horrible conceit ofdeath and night,

198
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.230
Together with the terrorof the place--

199
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:48.400
As in a vault, an ancientreceptacle,

200
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.470
Where, for these manyhundred years, the bones

201
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.630
Of all my buried ancestorsare packed:

202
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.700
Where bloody Tybalt, yetbut green in earth,

203
00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.370
Lies festering in hisshroud; where, as they say,

204
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.270
At some hours in the nightspirits resort--

205
00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.600
Alack, alack, is it notlike that I,

206
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.500
So early waking, what withloathsome smells,

207
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.630
And shrieks like mandrakestorn out of the earth,

208
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:14.600
That living mortals,hearing them, run mad--

209
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.870
O, if I wake, shall I notbe distraught,

210
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.500
Environed with all thesehideous fears?

211
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.970
And madly play with myforefather's joints?

212
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.270
And pluck the mangledTybalt from his shroud?

213
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.500
And, in this rage, withsome great kinsman's bone,

214
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.670
As with a club, dash outmy desperate brains?

215
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:38.200
O, look! methinks I see mycousin's ghost

216
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.730
Seeking out Romeo, thatdid spit his body

217
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:46.530
Upon a rapier's point:stay, Tybalt, stay!

218
00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:04.000
Romeo, I come! this do Idrink to thee.

219
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.570
Gregory.

220
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:28.530
Nurse, take these keys,and fetch more spices.

221
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.800
They call for dates andquinces in the pastry.

222
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.700
Come, stir, stir, stir! thesecond cock hath crow'd,

223
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.670
The curfew-bell hath rung,'tis three o'clock:

224
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.900
Look to the baked meats,good Angelica:

225
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.100
Spare not for the cost.

226
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.000
Go, you cot-quean, go, Getyou to bed; faith,

227
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.130
You'll be sick to-morrowFor this night's watching.

228
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.270
No, not a whit.

229
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.530
I have watch'd ere now

230
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.330
All night for lesser cause,and ne'er been sick.

231
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.330
Ay, you have been amouse-hunt in your time;

232
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.200
But I'll watch you fromsuch watching now.

233
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.770
Jealous hood, a jealoushood!

234
00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.000
Well, fellow, what isthere?

235
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.830
Things for the cook, sir;but I know not what.

236
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.130
Make haste, make haste.

237
00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:02.230
Sirrah, fetch drier logs:

238
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.400
Peter will show thee wherethey are.

239
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.170
I have a head, sir, thatwill find out logs,

240
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.900
And never trouble Peterfor the matter.

241
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.070
Mass, and well said; amerry whoreson, ha!

242
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.330
Thou shalt be logger-head.

243

Good faith, 'tis day:

The county will be herewith music straight,

Nurse! Wife! What, ho!

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:15.370
Alack! alack, my lady'sdead!

274
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.730
Help, help!

275
00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:22.370
O, well-a-day, that ever Iwas born!

276
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.470
Some aqua vitae, ho!

277
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:27.570
My lord! my lady!

278
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:28.670
What noise is here?

279
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.800
O lamentable day!

280
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.900
What's the matter?

281
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.000
Look, look!

282
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.630
O heavy day!

283
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.830
My child, my only life,

284
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:47.030
Revive, look up,

285
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.400

Help, help!

287
00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.930
Call help.

288
00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.230
For shame, bring Julietforth; her lord is come.

289
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:04.970
She's dead, deceased,she's dead; alack the day!

290
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:11.230
Alack the day, she's dead,she's dead, she's dead!

291
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.200
Ha! let me see her:

292
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.470
out, alas! she's cold:

293
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.230
Her blood is settled, andher joints are stiff;

294
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.770
Life and these lips havelong been separated:

295
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:33.170
Death lies on her like anuntimely frost

296
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.530
Upon the sweetest flowerof all the field.

297
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.500
O lamentable day!

298
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:43.300
O woeful time!

299
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.300
Death, that hath ta'en herhence to make me wail,

300
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:51.630
Ties up my tongue, andwill not let me speak.

301
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.570
Come, is the bride readyto go to church?

302
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:24.230
Ready to go, but never toreturn.

303
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:28.530
O son! the night beforethy wedding-day

304
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:32.100
Hath Death lain with thywife.

305
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.130
There she lies,

306
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:39.700
Flower as she was,deflowered by him.

307
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:46.770
Death is my son-in-law,Death is my heir;

308
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:51.630
My daughter he hathwedded: I will die,

309
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:58.130
And leave him all; life,living, all is Death's.

310
00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:01.770
Have I thought long to seethis morning's face,

311
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.530
And doth it give me such asight as this?

312
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:10.570
Accursed, unhappy,wretched, hateful day!

313
00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:14.800
Most miserable hour thate'er time saw

314
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.600
In lasting labour of hispilgrimage!

315
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:27.300
But one, poor one, onepoor and loving child,

316
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.600
But one thing to rejoiceand solace in,

317
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:37.230
And cruel death hathcatch'd it from my sight!

318
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.030
O woe!

319
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.430
O woeful, woeful, woefulday!

320
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:46.700
Most lamentable day, mostwoeful day,

321
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.700
That ever, ever, I did yetbehold!

322
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.470
Uncomfortable time, whycamest thou now

323
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.100
To murder, murder oursolemnity?

324
00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:04.100
O child! O child!

325
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.570
my soul, but not my child!

326
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:14.230
Dead art thou! Alack! mychild is dead;

327
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:17.370
And with my child my joysare buried.

328
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:21.030
Peace, ho, for shame!confusion's cure lives not

329
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.700
In these confusions.Heaven and yourself

330
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.030
Had part in this fairmaid; now heaven hath all,

331
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.370
And all the better is itfor the maid:

332
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.900
Dry up your tears, andstick your rosemary

333
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.730
On this fair corse; and,as our custom is,

334
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.330
In all her best array bearher to church:

335
00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.700
For though fond naturebids us all lament,

336
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.730
Yet nature's tears arereason's merriment.

337
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.600
All things that weordained festival,

338
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.570
Turn from their office toblack funeral;

339
00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:53.300
Our instruments tomelancholy bells,

340
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.800
Our wedding cheer to a sadburial feast,

341
00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.070
Our solemn hymns to sullendirges change,

342
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:06.370
Our bridal flowers servefor a buried corse,

343
00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.600
And all things change themto the contrary.

344
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:15.200
Sir, go you in; and,madam, go with him;

345
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.130
And go, Sir Paris; all ofyou prepare

346
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.800
To follow this fair corseunto her grave:

347
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:27.970
The heavens do lour uponyou for some ill;

348
00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:32.200
Move them no more bycrossing their high will.

349
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:57.200
Faith, we may put up ourpipes, and be gone.

350
00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.230
