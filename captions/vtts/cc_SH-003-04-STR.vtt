00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.570


2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.670
Thursday, sir? the time is very short.

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.670
My father Capulet will have it so;

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.870
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

5
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.370
You say you do not know the lady's mind:

6
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.270
Uneven is the course, I like it not.

7
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.870
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.330
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;

9
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.870
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.

10
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.930
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous

11
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.570
That she do give her sorrow so much sway,

12
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.030
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,

13
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.500
To stop the inundation of her tears;

14
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.600
Which, too much minded by herself alone,

15
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.270
May be put from her by society:

16
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.300
Now do you know the reason of this haste.

17
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.600
I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.

18
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.100
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.

19
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.170
Happily met, my lady and my wife!

20
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.430
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

21
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.930
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

22
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.630
What must be shall be.

23
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.900
That's a certain text.

24
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.630
Come you to make confession to this father?

25
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.600
To answer that, I should confess to you.

26
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.670
Do not deny to him that you love me.

27
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.570
I will confess to you that I love him.

28
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.930
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

29
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.300
If I do so, it will be of more price,

30
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.300
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

31
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.070
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;

32
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.530
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

33
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.400
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.

34
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.000
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

35
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.200
God shield I should disturb devotion!

36
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.930
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:

37
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.270
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

38
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.300
O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,

39
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.330
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!

40
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.000
Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;

41
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.770
It strains me past the compass of my wits:

42
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.430
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,

43
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.470
On Thursday next be married to this county.

44
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.970
Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,

45
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.570
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:

46
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.930
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,

47
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.700
Do thou but call my resolution wise,

48
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.970
And with this knife I'll help it presently.

49
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.670
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;

50
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.200
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,

51
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.600
Shall be the label to another deed,

52
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.800
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt

53
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.300
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:

54
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.870
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,

55
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.800
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,

56
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.770
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife

57
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.270
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that

58
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.170
Which the commission of thy years and art

59
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.000
Could to no issue of true honour bring.

60
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.230
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,

61
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.870
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

62
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.870
Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,

63
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.870
Which craves as desperate an execution

64
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.770
As that is desperate which we would prevent.

65
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.730
If, rather than to marry County Paris,

66
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.600
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,

67
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.530
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake

68
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.500
A thing like death to chide away this shame.

69
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.470
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,

70
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.330
From off the battlements of any tower;

71
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.300
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk

72
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.500
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;

73
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.030
Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,

74
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.130
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,

75
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.800
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;

76
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.970
Or bid me go into a new-made grave

77
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.200
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;

78
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.870
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;

79
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.130
And I will do it without fear or doubt,

80
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.330
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

81
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.270
Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent

82
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.930
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:

83
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.430
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;

84
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.930
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:

85
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.900
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,

86
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.500
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;

87
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.200
When presently through all thy veins shall run

88
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.970
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse

89
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.930
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:

90
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.900
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;

91
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.970
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade

92
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.630
To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,

93
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.200
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;

94
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.270
Each part, deprived of supple government,

95
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.630
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:

96
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.830
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death

97
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.700
Shalt thou continue two and forty hours,

98
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.400
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.

99
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.000
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes

100
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.630
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:

101
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.230
Then, as the manner of our country is,

102
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.800
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier

103
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.470
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault

104
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.230
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.

105
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.530
In the mean time,

106
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.130
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,

107
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.900
And hither shall he come: and he and I

108
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.830
Will watch thy waking, and that very night

109
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.900
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.

110
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.800
And this shall free thee from this present shame;

111
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.870
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,

112
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.870
Abate thy valour in the acting it.

113
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.100
O give me, give me!

114
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.900
O, tell not me of fear!

115
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.030
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous

116
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.800
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed

117
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.670
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

118
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.170
Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.

119
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.370
Farewell, dear father!

120
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.400
Samson!

121
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.030
My fan.

122
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.430
Before, and at pace.

123
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.270
How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?

124
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.570
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin

125
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.170
Of disobedient opposition

126
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.430
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd

127
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.470
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,

128
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.770
To beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!

129
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.270
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.

130
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.000
Send for the county; go tell him of this:

131
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.470
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

132
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.100
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;

133
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.570
And gave him what becomed love I might,

134
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.730
Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.

135
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.930
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:

136
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.400
This is as't should be.

137
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.000
Let me see the county;

138
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.170
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.

139
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.670
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,

140
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.900
And all our whole city is much bound to him.

141
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.000
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,

142
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.170
To help me sort such needful ornaments

143
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.100
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?

144
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.700
No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.

145
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.730
Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.

146
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.900
We shall be short in our provisions:

147
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.170
'Tis now near night.

148
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.630
Tush, I will stir about,

149
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.330
And all things will be well, I warrant thee, wife:

150
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.870
Go thou with Juliet, help to deck up her;

151
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.970
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;

152
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.600
I'll play the housewife for this once.

153
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.130
What, ho!

154
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.170
They are all forth.

155
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.770
Well, I will walk myself

156
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.600
To County Paris, and prepare up him

157
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.100
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,

158
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:03.000
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

159
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:13.530
Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,

160
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.230
I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,

161
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.730
For I have need of many orisons

162
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.300
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,

163
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.000
Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.

164
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.570
What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?

165
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.630
No, madam; we have cull'd necessaries

166
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.830
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:

167
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.770
So please you, let me now be left alone,

168
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.930
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;

169
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:39.230
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,

170
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.900
In this so sudden business.

171
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.000
Good night:

172
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.370
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.

173
00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.770
Farewell!

174
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.970
God knows when we shall meet again.

175
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.500
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,

176
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.430
That almost freezes up the heat of life:

177
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:16.630
I'll call them back again to comfort me: Nurse!

178
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:25.900
What should she do here?

179
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.530
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.

180
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.930
Come, vial.

181
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.530
What if this mixture do not work at all?

182
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.670
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?

183
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:50.600
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.

184
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.600
What if it be a poison, which the friar

185
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.970
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,

186
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.300
Lest in this marriage he be dishonour'd,

187
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.770
Because he married me before to Romeo?

188
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:09.970
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,

189
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:13.400
For he hath still been tried a holy man.

190
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.830
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,

191
00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.630
I wake before the time that Romeo

192
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:25.000
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!

193
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.070
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,

194
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.300
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,

195
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.630
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?

196
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:37.400
Or, if I live, is it not very like,

197
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.900
The horrible conceit of death and night,

198
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.230
Together with the terror of the place--

199
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:48.400
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,

200
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.470
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones

201
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.630
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:

202
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.700
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,

203
00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.370
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,

204
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.270
At some hours in the night spirits resort--

205
00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.600
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,

206
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.500
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,

207
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.630
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,

208
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:14.600
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad--

209
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.870
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,

210
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.500
Environed with all these hideous fears?

211
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.970
And madly play with my forefather's joints?

212
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.270
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?

213
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.500
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,

214
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.670
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?

215
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:38.200
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost

216
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.730
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body

217
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:46.530
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!

218
00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:04.000
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

219
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.570
Gregory.

220
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:28.530
Nurse, take these keys, and fetch more spices.

221
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.800
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

222
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.700
Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,

223
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.670
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:

224
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.900
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:

225
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.100
Spare not for the cost.

226
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.000
Go, you cot-quean, go, Get you to bed; faith,

227
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.130
You'll be sick to-morrow For this night's watching.

228
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.270
No, not a whit.

229
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.530
I have watch'd ere now

230
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.330
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.

231
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.330
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;

232
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.200
But I'll watch you from such watching now.

233
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.770
Jealous hood, a jealous hood!

234
00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.000
Well, fellow, what is there?

235
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.830
Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.

236
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.130
Make haste, make haste.

237
00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:02.230
Sirrah, fetch drier logs:

238
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.400
Peter will show thee where they are.

239
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.170
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,

240
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.900
And never trouble Peter for the matter.

241
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.070
Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!

242
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.330
Thou shalt be logger-head.

243
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.600
Good faith, 'tis day:

244
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.470
The county will be here with music straight,

245
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.870
For so he said he would: I hear him near.

246
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.000
Nurse! Wife! What, ho!

247
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.270
What, nurse, I say!

248
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.570
Go waken Juliet, help to trim her up;

249
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:31.170
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,

250
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.030
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:

251
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.100
Make haste, I say.

252
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:44.670
Mistress!

253
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.330
what, mistress!

254
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.730
Juliet!

255
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.130
fast, I warrant her, she:

256
00:13:53.130 --> 00:14:01.470
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!

257
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:08.870
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!

258
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:13.000
What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;

259
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.130
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,

260
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.170
The County Paris hath set up his rest,

261
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:21.570
That you shall rest but little.

262
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.300
God forgive me, Marry, and amen,

263
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.300
how sound is she asleep!

264
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.530
I needs must wake her.

265
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:36.100
Madam, madam, madam!

266
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.670
Ay, let the county take you in your bed;

267
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.130
He'll fright you up, i' faith. will it not be?

268
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.470
What, dress'd! and in your clothes!

269
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.730
and down again?

270
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.470
I needs must wake you;

271
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.100
Mada--

272
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.470
Lady!

273
00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:15.370
Alack! alack, my lady's dead!

274
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.730
Help, help!

275
00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:22.370
O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!

276
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.470
Some aqua vitae, ho!

277
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:27.570
My lord! my lady!

278
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:28.670
What noise is here?

279
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.800
O lamentable day!

280
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.900
What's the matter?

281
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.000
Look, look!

282
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.630
O heavy day!

283
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.830
My child, my only life,

284
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:47.030
Revive, look up,

285
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.400
or I will die with thee!

286
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.700
Help, help!

287
00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.930
Call help.

288
00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.230
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

289
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:04.970
She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!

290
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:11.230
Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!

291
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.200
Ha! let me see her:

292
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.470
out, alas! she's cold:

293
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.230
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;

294
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.770
Life and these lips have long been separated:

295
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:33.170
Death lies on her like an untimely frost

296
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.530
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

297
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.500
O lamentable day!

298
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:43.300
O woeful time!

299
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.300
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,

300
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:51.630
Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.

301
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.570
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

302
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:24.230
Ready to go, but never to return.

303
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:28.530
O son! the night before thy wedding-day

304
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:32.100
Hath Death lain with thy wife.

305
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.130
There she lies,

306
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:39.700
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.

307
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:46.770
Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;

308
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:51.630
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,

309
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:58.130
And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.

310
00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:01.770
Have I thought long to see this morning's face,

311
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.530
And doth it give me such a sight as this?

312
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:10.570
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!

313
00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:14.800
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw

314
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.600
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!

315
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:27.300
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,

316
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.600
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,

317
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:37.230
And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!

318
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.030
O woe!

319
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.430
O woeful, woeful, woeful day!

320
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:46.700
Most lamentable day, most woeful day,

321
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.700
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!

322
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.470
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now

323
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.100
To murder, murder our solemnity?

324
00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:04.100
O child! O child!

325
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.570
my soul, but not my child!

326
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:14.230
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;

327
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:17.370
And with my child my joys are buried.

328
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:21.030
Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not

329
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.700
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself

330
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.030
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,

331
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.370
And all the better is it for the maid:

332
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.900
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary

333
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.730
On this fair corse; and, as our custom is,

334
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.330
In all her best array bear her to church:

335
00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.700
For though fond nature bids us all lament,

336
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.730
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

337
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.600
All things that we ordained festival,

338
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.570
Turn from their office to black funeral;

339
00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:53.300
Our instruments to melancholy bells,

340
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.800
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,

341
00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.070
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,

342
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:06.370
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,

343
00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.600
And all things change them to the contrary.

344
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:15.200
Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;

345
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.130
And go, Sir Paris; all of you prepare

346
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.800
To follow this fair corse unto her grave:

347
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:27.970
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;

348
00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:32.200
Move them no more by crossing their high will.

349
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:57.200
Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.

350
00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.230
Musicians, O, musicians, "Heart's ease," "Heart's ease:"

351
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.030
O, an you will have me live, play "Heart's ease."

352
00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.730
Why "Heart's ease?"

353
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.830
O, musicians, because my heart itself plays

354
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.470
"My heart is full of woe:"

355
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:15.200
O, play me some merry dump, to comfort me.

356
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.830
Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.

357
00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:30.170
