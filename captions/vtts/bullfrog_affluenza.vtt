00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.370

        THEN WHY DO I FEEL SO AWFUL?


00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.010

        SO BLOATED
        AND SLUGGISH?

        NOTHING GIVES ME JOY ANYMORE--


00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.610

        NOT THE HOUSE, THE CAR,
        THE CLOTHES, THE RAISE.

        NOTHING!


00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.150

        DOCTOR, I'M FRIGHTENED.


00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.280

        WELL, DO SOMETHING!


00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.790

        CAN'T YOU GIVE ME A PILL?


00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.260

        THERE'S NO PILL
        FOR WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU.
      

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.320

        I'M AFRAID
        YOU'RE SUFFERING FROM...
      

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.060

        AFFLUENZA.


00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.700

        OH, MY GOD!


00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.160

        WHY ME?


00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.700

        IS IT FATAL?


00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.070

        IT'S CATASTROPHIC.


00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.040

        IT'S THE NEW EPIDEMIC.


00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.670

        WELL, THERE IS A CURE,
        ISN'T THERE?
      

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.410

        POSSIBLY.


00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.080

        AFFLUENZA IS A MAJOR DISEASE;
        THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
      

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.250

        AND MANY PEOPLE SUFFER FROM IT,
        BUT VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE AWARE
      

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.960

        THAT THAT'S WHAT
        THEY'RE SUFFERING FROM.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.040

        HI, I'M SCOTT SIMON.


00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.110

        ARE YOU SPENDING MORE NOW
        BUT ENJOYING IT LESS?
      

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.550

        MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
        APPARENTLY ARE.
      

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.980

        WE'RE FILLING OUR LIVES
        WITH THINGS
      

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.650

        AND THEN TELLING PUBLIC OPINION
        POLLSTERS AND CLERGY
      

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.020

        AND PSYCHIATRISTS AND FRIENDS
        THAT WE FEEL EMPTY INSIDE.
      

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.100

        NEVER BEFORE, IT SEEMS, HAS SO
        MUCH MEANT SO LITTLE TO SO MANY.
      

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.000

        Man:
        THERE'S A UNIVERSAL FEELING
	IN THIS NATION
      

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.800

        THAT WE'VE BECOME
        TOO MATERIALISTIC, TOO GREEDY
      

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.800

        TOO SELFISH, TOO SELF-ABSORBED


00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.670

        AND THAT WE NEED TO BRING
        BACK INTO BALANCE
      

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.970

        THE ENDURING VALUES


00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.510

        THAT HAVE GUIDED
        THIS COUNTRY OVER GENERATIONS.
      

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.150

        Simon:
        SOME CALL THE AFFLICTION
	"AFFLUENZA"
      

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.350

        UNTREATED, IT CAN CAUSE
        PERMANENT DISCONTENT.
      

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.290

        AFFLUENZA'S COSTS
        AND CONSEQUENCES FOR US
      

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.630

        FOR OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES


00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.860

        FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS
        AND THE EARTH ITSELF--
      

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.870

        ARE IMMENSE,
        THOUGH OFTEN CONCEALED.
      

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.830

        WE HUMAN BEINGS,
        ESPECIALLY IN THIS CENTURY
      

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.670

        HAVE BEEN PRODUCING
        AND CONSUMING
      

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.610

        AT A RATE THAT FAR EXCEEDS
        THE ABILITY OF THE PLANET
      

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.940

        TO EITHER ABSORB OUR POLLUTION
        OR REPLENISH THE STOCK.
      

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.210

        IT'S GOING
        TO HURT A BIT.
      

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.510

        Simon:
        AFFLUENZA CAN BE CURED
      

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.150

        BUT THE VIRUS
        IS VERY CONTAGIOUS.
      

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.790

        ( growling ):
        BUY NOW, PAY LATER.
      

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.460

        Simon:
        AND IT'S BEEN SPREADING
	FOR QUITE A WHILE.
      

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.260

        Woman:
         I WANT A CORVETTE
      

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.500

         I WANT A PONTIAC, TOO.


00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.600

        Man:
         LET'S GO ALL OUT
	AND BUY A CADILLAC, TOO.
      

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.410

        Woman:
         I CAN HARDLY WAIT
	FOR THIS DREAM TO COME TRUE.
      

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.180

        Simon:
        ARE YOU OLD ENOUGH
	TO REMEMBER THE '50S
      

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.410

        THAT GOLDEN AGE OF PROSPERITY
        FOLLOWING THE SECOND WORLD WAR?
      

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.380

        Announcer:
        IT'S A GREAT LIFE, EH, BOB?
      

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.990

        AND TOMORROW
        WILL BE EVEN BETTER
      

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:23.360

        FOR YOU AND FOR ALL THE PEOPLE.


00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.870

        Simon:
        WE FELT RICHER THEN
	THAN WE DO NOW.
      

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.670

        A FAMOUS BOOK OF THE TIME CALLED
        AMERICA "THE AFFLUENT SOCIETY."
      

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.670

        A BOOK WHOSE TITLE
        WOULD BE LAUGHABLE TODAY.
      

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.910

        PEOPLE WOULD REJECT IT,
        EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE
      

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.950

        ACTUALLY, IN TERMS OF GROSS
        NATIONAL PRODUCT AND SO FORTH
      

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.680

        MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH.


00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.320

        EVERYBODY'S HOME HAS GOT
        TWICE AS MUCH STUFF IN IT.
      

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.820

        Simon:
        BACK IN 1958
      

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.360

        ONLY FOUR PERCENT OF
        AMERICAN HOMES HAD DISHWASHERS.
      

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.130

        NOW MORE THAN HALF DO.


00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.230

        LESS THAN ONE PERCENT
        HAD COLOR TELEVISIONS.
      

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.870

        NOW IT'S 97%.


00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.840

        AND THERE WERE NO MICROWAVES,
        V.C.R.s OR PERSONAL COMPUTERS.
      

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.470

        Man:
        UH... FOUR-CAR GARAGE?
      

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.840

        IT'S PROBABLY
        BECAUSE OF STORAGE.
      

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.040

        YOU NEVER HAVE
        ENOUGH STORAGE
      

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.950

        AND SO, YOU KNOW,
        YOU NEVER HAVE ENOUGH GARAGES.
      

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.450

        Simon:
        NEVER ENOUGH.
      

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.120

        SO MUCH STUFF, SO LITTLE SPACE


00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.150

        EVEN THOUGH
        THE AVERAGE NEW HOUSE
      

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.150

        HAS GROWN LARGER EVERY DECADE.


00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.020

        NOW MANY NEW HOMES
        HAVE THREE-CAR GARAGES--
      

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.430

        NEARLY 900 SQUARE FEET
        OF GARAGE SPACE ALONE
      

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.660

        WHICH IS ALMOST THE SIZE OF
        AN ENTIRE HOME IN THE '50s.
      

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.870

        OH, DARLING,
        IT'S GOING TO BE
	JUST PERFECT!

        THE WORLD OF 1960...


00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.180

        A WONDERFUL NEW WORLD OF FORDS.


00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.480

        Simon:
        IN THAT GILDED NEW WORLD
      

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.650

        HARDLY ANY NEW CARS
        HAD AIR CONDITIONING.
      

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.580

        TODAY, MORE THAN 90% DO.


00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.420

        ECONOMY CARS NOW OFFER
        MORE FEATURES
      

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.120

        THAN LUXURY CARS DID THEN.


00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.890

        Woman:
        COLOR IS IMPORTANT.
      

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.960

        I DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH
        ABOUT GAS MILEAGE AT ALL.
      

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.230

        IT'S NOT SOMETHING
        THAT I LOOK AT.
      

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.300

        A LOT OF MONEY.


00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.860

        YES, IT IS.


00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.970

        Simon:
        TODAY'S HOTTEST-SELLING CARS
      

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.240

        ARE EXPENSIVE, GAS-HUNGRY
        SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES.
      

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.940

        FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE,
        IT'S A STATUS SYMBOL.
      

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.510

        SO THEY'RE WILLING TO SPEND THE
        30 TO 40-ODD THOUSAND DOLLARS
      

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.480

        TO DRIVE ONE OF THESE VEHICLES.


00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.650

        Announcer:
        YES, FUN TO SEE
      

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:21.950

        FUN TO DRIVE


00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.480

        FUN TO BUY--


00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.220

        THE NEW CHEVROLET.


00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.790

        Simon:
        JUST AS THEY DID IN THE '50s
      

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.790

        NEW CARS STILL HELP US
        KEEP UP WITH THE JONESES.
      

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.890

        BUT THESE DAYS, WE FIND IT
        MORE APPEALING TO FLY.
      

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.800

        WE FLY 25 TIMES
        AS MUCH AS WE DID THEN.
      

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.000

        SOMETIMES WE FLY JUST TO SHOP.


00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.400

        Woman:
        DON'T JUST STAND THERE--
      

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.310

        GIVE ME YOUR CREDIT CARD!


00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.880

         WELL, THOSE EAST COAST STORES
        REALLY KNOCK ME OUT 
      

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.640

         THEY LEAVE
        THE WEST BEHIND... 
      

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.180

        Simon:
        POTOMAC MILLS ATTRACTS
	MORE VISITORS
      

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.220

        THAN ANY OTHER SITE IN VIRGINIA.


00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.190

        THIS SHOPPING MALL IS SUCH
        A POPULAR TOURIST DESTINATION
      

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.390

        AIRLINES OFFER EXCURSION FLIGHTS
        HERE FROM DISTANT CITIES.
      

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.520

        WHERE ARE
        YOU FROM?
      

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.930

        DALLAS AREA.


00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.930

        Simon:
        POTOMAC MILLS IS
	A DISCOUNT SUPERMALL
      

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.870

        DIVIDED INTO WHAT
        ARE EUPHEMISTICALLY
	CALLED "NEIGHBORHOODS."
      

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.900

        SHOPPING MALLS HAVE BECOME
        THE CENTERS OF MANY COMMUNITIES.
      

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.440

        CHILDREN, AS WELL AS ADULTS,
        SEE A SHOPPING CENTER
      

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.410

        AS JUST THE NATURAL DESTINATION
        TO FILL A BORED LIFE.
      

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.750

        Simon:
        70% OF US VISIT MALLS EACH WEEK
      

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.820

        MORE THAN ATTEND
        CHURCHES OR SYNAGOGUES.
      

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.850

        ON AVERAGE, WE SHOP
        SIX HOURS A WEEK
      

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.760

        AND SPEND ONLY 40 MINUTES
        PLAYING WITH OUR CHILDREN.
      

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.930

        YOU SHOP,
        YOU SPEND MONEY--
	WHAT ELSE MATTERS?
      

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.530

        Announcer:
        IT'S A HAPPY-GO-SPENDING WORLD
      

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.930

        REFLECTED IN THE WINDOWS OF
        THE SUBURBAN SHOPPING CENTERS
      

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.400

        WHERE THEY GO TO BUY.


00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.170

        Simon:
        BY 1987
      

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:54.070

        AMERICA HAD MORE SHOPPING MALLS
        THAN HIGH SCHOOLS.
      

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.680

        FEW MALL SHOPPERS COME
        WITH ANY INTENTION
      

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.910

        OF PURCHASING
        A PARTICULAR PRODUCT.
      

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.480

        MOST BUY LARGELY ON IMPULSE.


00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.550

        Woman:
        OOH, PARTY SNACKS!
      

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:06.420

        Simon:
        AS THIS OLD SALES TRAINING FILM
	SUGGESTS, THAT'S NO ACCIDENT
      

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:10.490

        Man:
        AND HERE'S THAT MOST IMPORTANT
	STORE DECISION OF ALL:
      

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.020

        THE IMPULSE PURCHASE.


00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:12.930

        TO MAKE
        PEOPLE
	HUNGRY
      

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.230

        FOR AS MUCH
        AS POSSIBLE--
      

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.930

        HUNGRY ENOUGH
        TO BUY A LOT MORE
      

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.060

        THAN THEY
        PLANNED TO.
      

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.900

        Woman:
        Buy the half-price dress.
      

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.770

        The cocktail party will come.


00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.970

        Have you been
        to Potomac Mills this month?
      

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.440

        Simon:
        IT WAS AN INGRATIATINGLY
	CLEVER AD CAMPAIGN
      

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.240

        THAT FIRST LURED ME
        TO POTOMAC MILLS MALL.
      

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.180

        Shopping is therapy.


00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.910

        Listen to that little voice
        in your head.
      

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.950

        Shop... shop... shop... shop...


00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.780

        You can buy happiness--


00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.090

        just don't pay retail for it.


00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.420

        Simon:
        BUT EVEN WHOLESALE
      

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.760

        THE PRICE IS HIGHER THAN MOST
        OF US SEEM ABLE TO AFFORD.
      

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.290

        IN FACT


00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.930

        THE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS
        CALLING THEMSELVES "VERY HAPPY"
      

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.330

        REACHED ITS HIGHEST POINT
        BACK IN 1957.
      

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.330

        THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REALITY
        OF PEOPLE IS
      

00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:00.210

        THAT ALMOST THEIR ENTIRE
        ORIENTATION TO HOW WE ARE DOING
      

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.910

        IS BASED ON COMPARISON.


00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.310

        THAT'S WHY
        AS AN ENTIRE SOCIETY GROWS
      

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.180

        PEOPLE DON'T FEEL ANY BETTER


00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.910

        BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL
        IN THE SAME RELATIVE POSITION.
      

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.750

        THERE'S THIS SENSE OF BEING
        ON AN ENDLESS TREADMILL
      

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.390

        AND OF NEVER GETTING


00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.090

        TO WHERE YOU THOUGHT
        YOU WERE GOING TO GET.
      

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:22.130

        Simon:
        STILL, WE KEEP ON INCREASING
	OUR CONSUMPTION
      

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:27.970

        PARTLY BY SAVING LESS
        AND WORKING MORE.
      

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.370

        IN OUR RESEARCH, WE HEAR
        THE SAME REFRAIN ALL THE TIME:
      

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.470

        "I HAVE NO LIFE.


00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:33.800

        "I GET UP IN THE MORNING


00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.710

        "DAY CARE, ELDER CARE...


00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.710

        "A 20- TO 40- MINUTE
        COMMUTE TO WORK.
      

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.180

        "I HAVE TO WORK LATE.


00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.210

        "I GET HOME AT NIGHT.


00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.280

        "THERE'S LAUNDRY, BILLS TO PAY


00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.150

        "JAM SOMETHING
        INTO THE MICROWAVE OVEN.
      

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.450

        "I'M EXHAUSTED,
        GO TO SLEEP, WAKE UP
      

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.090

        AND THE ROUTINE BEGINS
        THE NEXT DAY ALL OVER AGAIN."
      

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.130

        THIS IS WHAT LIFE
        HAS BECOME IN AMERICA.
      

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.830

        WOULD JESUS BE
        AGENDA-DRIVEN?
      

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.560

        WOULD HE CARRY
        A BEEPER?
      

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.500

        CAN YOU IMAGINE HIM


00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.760

        GETTING BEEPED OUT
        OF THE LAST SUPPER?
      

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.530

        Simon:
        RICHARD SWENSON, M.D.
      

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.800

        HE COULD BE CALLED
        AN "AFFLUENZA EPIDEMIOLOGIST."
      

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.280

        Swenson:
        IF YOU LOOK AT THE COUNTRIES
	THAT HAVE THE MOST PROSPERITY
      

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.710

        THEY ARE THE SAME COUNTRIES
        THAT HAVE THE MOST STRESS.
      

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.480

        Simon:
        DR. SWENSON IS CONVINCED
      

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.850

        THAT MUCH OF THE PAIN
        HIS PATIENTS SUFFER
      

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.020

        IS A RESULT OF WHAT HE CALLS
        "POSSESSION OVERLOAD."
      

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.890

        IT COULD BE PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS:
        YOU MIGHT HAVE HEADACHES
      

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.030

        LOW BACK PAIN, HYPERACIDITY,
        PALPITATIONS IN THE HEART
      

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.090

        UNEXPLAINED ACHES AND PAINS.


00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:30.300

        IT COULD BE EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS.


00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.160

        I MEAN, IT COULD
        BE LIKE DEPRESSION
      

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.470

        OR IT COULD BE
        ANXIETY, SLEEPLESSNESS.
      

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.270

        YOU FIND THAT YOUR LIFE
        IS BEING TAKEN UP
      

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:41.110

        BY MAINTAINING AND CARING
        FOR THINGS INSTEAD OF PEOPLE:
      

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.240

        "EVERYTHING I OWN OWNS ME."


00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.180

        WE'VE HAD A LOT
        OF SICKNESS THIS YEAR--
      

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.850

        INCREDIBLE AMOUNT
        OF SICKNESS.
      

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.320

        Simon:
        DR. SWENSON SAYS
	AMERICANS IN EPIDEMIC NUMBERS
      

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.620

        HAVE BEEN PUSHED BEYOND
        THEIR EMOTIONAL, PHYSICAL
      

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.490

        AND FINANCIAL LIMITS, AS
        THEY'VE CHASED A DREAM FOR MORE.
      

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.830

        THEY HAVE EXHAUSTION AND THEIR
        RELATIONSHIPS ARE VAPORIZING.
      

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.200

        THEY'RE SURROUNDED
        BY ALL KINDS OF FUN TOYS
      

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:09.770

        BUT THE MEANING HAS GONE.


00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.970

        THE SECRET TO A GOOD
        RELATIONSHIP CAN BE FOUND
      

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.540

        IN NEW STRAWBERRY-KIWI JELL-O.


00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.510

        NEW IMPROVED TRIDENT.


00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.910

         NEW GAME BOY!


00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.110

        GIANT SLICES.


00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.480

        DO YOU MISS
        THE FURNITURE YOU LOVE?
      

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.980

        THE STUFF DREAMS ARE MADE OF.


00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.650

        Simon:
        BY THE AGE OF 20
      

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.320

        THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HAS SEEN
        A MILLION COMMERCIAL MESSAGES.
      

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.490

        A.P.R. 22.65% FOR BEST...


00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:31.760

        Woman:
        ADS ARE EVERYWHERE.
      

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.990

        IF YOU GET THE FEELING


00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.330

        THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE
        ADVERTISING AROUND
      

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.800

        THAN THERE WAS WHEN YOU WERE A
        KID, IT'S NOT YOUR IMAGINATION.
      

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.070

        Simon:
        ADVERTISING ACCOUNTS
	FOR TWO-THIRDS OF THE SPACE
      

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.370

        IN OUR NEWSPAPERS,
        AND 40% OF OUR MAIL.
      

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:49.340

        AMERICA SPENDS A BILLION DOLLARS
        A YEAR ON BILLBOARDS ALONE.
      

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.510

        THE EXTREME IS THE BILLBOARD


00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:56.420

        THAT WAS PROPOSED FOR OUTER
        SPACE THAT WOULD PROJECT LOGOS
      

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.420

        THAT WOULD LOOK
        ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE MOON
      

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.950

        VISIBLE TO PRACTICALLY
        EVERYBODY ON EARTH.
      

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.520

        You've got a big future
        ahead of you, kid.
      

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.390

        You'll be asked
        to endorse products.
      

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:09.060

        Simon:
        ON AVERAGE, EACH OF US WILL
	SPEND ONE FULL YEAR OF OUR LIVES
      

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.230

        WATCHING TV COMMERCIALS.


00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.530

        Mazur:
        ADVERTISING ENCOURAGES US
	TO MEET NONMATERIAL NEEDS
      

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.000

        THROUGH MATERIAL ENDS.


00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.340

        IT TELLS US TO BUY THEIR PRODUCT
        BECAUSE WE'LL BE LOVED
      

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.910

        WE'LL BE ACCEPTED,
        AND ALSO IT TELLS US
      

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.840

        THAT WE ARE NOT LOVABLE
        AND ACCEPTABLE
      

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.180

        WITHOUT BUYING THEIR PRODUCT.


00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.280

        AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS


00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.720

        THAT IT HELPS TURN
        CITIZENS INTO CONSUMERS.
      

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.320

        Man ( over speaker ):
        Attention, mall shoppers:
      

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.890

        There is a clearance
        at the shoe store.
      

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.930

        Simon:
        THE PROCESS BEGINS IN CHILDHOOD.
      

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.730

        There is a sale
        at the bookstore.
      

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.570

        THIS NEW GAME HELPS WHET
        CHILDREN'S APPETITES
      

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.870

        FOR SHOPPING.


00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.070

        There is a clearance
        at the kitchen store.
      

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.340

        Simon:
        THE WINNER IS THE ONE
	WHO BUYS THE MOST STUFF
      

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.140

        AND GETS BACK
        TO THE PARKING LOT FIRST.
      

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.140

        SAVING ISN'T PART
        OF THE STRATEGY.
      

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.040

        Harwood:
        60% OF ALL AMERICANS SAY
      

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.850

        THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE
        NOT JUST MATERIALISTIC;
      

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.850

        THEY'RE VERY MATERIALISTIC.


00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:08.020

        Simon:
        THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD NEWS
	TO SOME PEOPLE.
      

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.520

        CHILDREN ARE THE FASTEST-GROWING
        SEGMENT OF THE CONSUMER MARKET.
      

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.090

        AND MANY MAJOR CORPORATIONS
        ARE FINDING
      

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:18.030

        THAT THE CONSUMER LIFESTYLE
        STARTS YOUNGER AND YOUNGER.
      

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.530

        AND IF YOU WAIT TO TALK TO
        A PERSON ABOUT YOUR PRODUCT
      

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:25.900

        TILL THEY'RE 18 YEARS OF AGE,
        YOU PROBABLY WON'T CAPTURE THEM.
      

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.610

        Simon:
        OBVIOUSLY, SOMEBODY OUT THERE
      

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.670

        IS AFRAID THE YOUNGSTERS
        MIGHT ESCAPE.
      

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.850

        FROM 1980 TO 1995, THE AMOUNT
        TARGETED TO REACH THEM
      

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:38.620

        ROSE FROM $100 MILLION
        TO $1 BILLION A YEAR.
      

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.750

        IT'S PAYING OFF.


00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.020

        Simon:
        SO, WHAT'D YOU GET?
	MAY WE ASK?
      

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.420

        I GOT SOME
        DONNA KARAN,
	SOME GAP JEANS.
      

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:46.690

        I GOT A GAP
        SWEATER.
      

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.560

        I'M ON MY WAY
        TO GET A JACKET
      

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.930

        FROM AMERICAN EAGLE.


00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.800

        I'M ABOUT TO GET SOME SHOES


00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.330

        AND I GOT ME
        THIS DONNA KARAN JACKET.
      

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:55.430

        I THINK THAT'S GOOD.


00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.140

        THAT'LL GET
        THE MESSAGE ACROSS.
      

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.740

        Simon:
        JENNIFER GAILUS
	AND OLIVIA MARTIN WORRY
      

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.140

        THAT TODAY, TEENAGERS
        SEEK SELF-ESTEEM
      

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.440

        IN CLOTHES AND CARS


00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.410

        AND ARE OFTEN LEFT WITHOUT
        A GENUINE SENSE OF IDENTITY.
      

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.020

        WHILE THEY WERE HIGH SCHOOL
        SENIORS IN REDMOND, WASHINGTON
      

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.650

        JENNIE AND OLIVIA WROTE A PLAY
        CALLED "BARBIE GET REAL."
      

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:18.320

        HEY, YOU'RE WEARING
        NEW EYE SHADOW AREN'T YOU?
      

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.620

        IT LOOKS GREAT.


00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.430

        THANKS-- SO, WHAT ARE
        OUR PLANS FOR TODAY?
      

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.200

        WELL, FIRST,
        I THOUGHT WE COULD
      

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.130

        GO CRUISING AROUND
        IN YOUR PINK CORVETTE
      

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.670

        AND THEN WE COULD
        HIT THE MALL.
      

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.130

        GOOD IDEA!


00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.370

        MATT, SAY THAT LIKE
        IT'S THE BEST IDEA
	YOU'VE EVER HAD.
      

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.670

        BE REALLY EXCITED--
        "LET'S GO CRUISING."
      

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.980

        Simon:
        JENNIE AND OLIVIA PLAY
	DAZZLE AND NEON, BARBIE DOLLS
      

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:42.010

        WHOSE SHALLOW LIVES REVOLVE
        AROUND APPEARANCES AND SHOPPING.
      

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.110

        MIDWAY THROUGH THE PLAY


00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.550

        NEON HAS SECOND THOUGHTS
        ABOUT HER LIFE.
      

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.450

        WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?


00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.550

        I HAVE EVERYTHING:


00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:53.990

        THE RIGHT LOOK, THE RIGHT
        ATTITUDE, THE RIGHT FRIENDS
      

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.460

        BUT I STILL FEEL SO... EMPTY.


00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.100

        NEON IS FINALLY


00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.370

        MAKING HER
        TRANSFORMATION,
	HER CHANGE
      

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.670

        SO DON'T LET IT
        AFFECT YOUR SMILE
      

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.040

        BUT STILL SHOW
        A LOT OF ANGER
      

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.510

        THAT SHE'S MADE
        THIS OUTRAGEOUS
	CHANGE IN HER LIFE
      

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.040

        YOU KNOW, AND
        IT'S HURTING YOU.
      

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.740

        IT WAS NEVER ABOUT
        HER AS A PERSON;
      

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.150

        IT WAS ABOUT IMAGE,
        BEING SEEN TOGETHER.
      

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.480

        SOMETHING HAPPENED
        TO ME TODAY.
      

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.880

        I'VE BEEN
        FEELING SO ALONE
      

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.420

        AND I DON'T
        FEEL COMFORTABLE.
      

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.250

        ISN'T THERE
        A SHOE SALE NEXT WEEK?
      

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.790

        WHY ARE YOU SO AFRAID TO HAVE
        A REAL CONVERSATION WITH ME?
      

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.330

        DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE
        ABOUT ME AND WHO I REALLY AM?
      

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.590

        I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.


00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.900

        YOU'RE NEON BARBIE,
        THAT'S ALL I NEED TO KNOW.
      

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.830

        THERE'S MORE TO ME
        THAN WHERE I GO
      

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.970

        WHO I'M WITH
        AND MY ACCESSORIES.
      

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.770

        AT LEAST I WISH THERE WAS.


00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.770

        THERE IS MORE
        TO YOU THAN THAT:
      

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.140

        YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL, TOO,
        YOU DRIVE A GREAT CAR
      

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.440

        YOU LIVE IN
        A BEAUTIFUL DREAM HOUSE
      

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.110

        COMPLETE WITH YOUR
        BARBIE BUBBLING SPA
      

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.610

        AND YOU'RE DATING ME.


00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:49.980

        WHAT ELSE
        IS THERE?
      

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:50.850

        I'M HOLLOW INSIDE!


00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.080

        NEON, GET AHOLD
        OF YOURSELF.
      

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.190

        THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE.


00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.920

        SO, HOW WAS YOUR DATE?


00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.190

        Simon:
        OLIVIA AND JENNIE
	BEGAN TO QUESTION
      

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:03.030

        THE AMERICAN CONSUMER WAY OF
        LIFE AFTER A TRIP TO MEXICO.
      

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:07.000

        JUST THE WAY THEY LIVE
        DOWN THERE IS SO HARSH.
      

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.330

        THEY BARELY
        HAVE ENOUGH FOOD,
      

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.200

        ENOUGH CLOTHES,
        BUT THEY WERE SO GIVING.
      

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.040

        AND LOVING AND HAPPY PEOPLE
        DESPITE WHAT THEY HAD.
      

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.310

        YOU DON'T SEE THAT
        VERY MANY PLACES IN AMERICA.
      

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.350

        THE KIDS IN OUR HIGH SCHOOL TAKE
        EVERYTHING FOR GRANTED.
      

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.250

        THEY THINK THAT THEY DESERVE IT.


00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.750

        THEY THINK THAT SOMEHOW
        THEY'VE EARNED IT
      

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.020

        AND THE WORLD OWES IT TO THEM.


00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.890

        AND THEY'LL JUST TAKE,
        THEY WON'T GIVE ANYTHING BACK.
      

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:35.030

        OUR SOCIETY IS JUST GOING
        TO CRUMBLE IF WE DON'T HAVE...
      

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.700

        PEOPLE THAT GIVE.


00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.930

        Simon:
        AFTER PERFORMING "BARBIE GET REAL"
      

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.870

        JENNIE AND OLIVIA GAVE
        ALL THE MONEY THEY MADE
      

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.600

        TO HABITAT FOR HUMANITY, WHICH
        BUILDS HOUSING FOR THE POOR.
      

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.140

        THEY WON A NATIONAL AWARD
        FOR THEIR PLAY
      

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.080

        BUT IN THE MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS,
        THEY FACE STIFF COMPETITION.
      

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.080

        Man:
        KIDS LOVE ADVERTISING;
      

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.980

        IT'S A GIFT,
        IT'S SOMETHING THEY WANT.
      

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.650

        THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID
        ABOUT BEING THERE FIRST
      

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:04.060

        AND ABOUT BRANDING CHILDREN
        AND OWNING THEM IN THAT WAY.
      

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.120

        Simon:
        IT'S CALLED "KID POWER"
      

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.560

        BUT IT'S ABOUT
        SELLING THINGS TO KIDS.
      

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.130

        IN BOYS' ADVERTISING, IT IS
        AN AGGRESSIVE PLAY PATTERN.
      

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.530

        Simon:
        AT CONFERENCES LIKE THIS,
	MARKETERS DISCUSS
      

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.200

        THE LATEST STRATEGIES
        FOR REACHING CHILDREN.
      

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.640

        AND ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR
        IN PURSUIT OF A PRODUCT...
      

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.670

        IS A GOOD THING.


00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.240

        Simon:
        EXPERTS HAVE LEARNED A LITTLE
      

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.540

        SINCE THE EARLY DAYS
        OF MARKETING RESEARCH.

        LIMITLESS FIELD OF STUDY
      

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:37.860

        BUT ONE IN WHICH THEY ARE LOST
        WITHOUT EXPERT GUIDANCE.
      

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:42.730

        WE ARE ENDEAVORING TO EVALUATE
        THE TEENAGE AMERICAN GIRL

        WHAT ARE
        TEENAGE CLOTHES?
      

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.200

        WHAT ARE YOUR GROUP'S
        SOCIAL HABITS?
      

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.940

        OVER THE COURSE
        OF THE PAST TEN OR 15 YEARS
      

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.970

        THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT BOOM


00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.740

        IN KIDS' RESEARCH
        AND KIDS' MARKETING.
      

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.180

        WE'RE GOING INTO STORE AISLES


00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.910

        AND WATCHING THEM SHOP
        WITH THEIR PARENTS.
      

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.020

        WE'RE GOING INTO
        THEIR HOMES AND KITCHENS
      

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.620

        SITTING IN THEIR BEDROOMS


00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.120

        TO SEE HOW
        THEY DECORATE THEIR ROOMS
      

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.490

        AND WE'RE GIVING THEM
        THE OPPORTUNITY
      

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.560

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.370

        NO!


00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:29.610

        OH, JUST A SECOND.


00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.710

        MOM, CAN I GET
        THIS TOY I
	SAW ON TV?
      

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.340

        GABE, WE CAN'T HAVE


00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.280

        EVERYTHING WE WANT.


00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.180

        YOU JUST DON'T WANT
        ME TO BE HAPPY.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.070

        YOU CAN'T STOP ME.

	CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS
      

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.980

        BUT TODAY'S MARKETING STRATEGIES
        ARE NOT LIMITED TO TELEVISION.
      

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.050

        Man:
        CHILDREN IN THIS SOCIETY ARE
	A CASH CROP TO BE HARVESTED.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.560

        MARKETERS ARE ATTEMPTING
        TO EXPLOIT THIS MARKET
      

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.370

        VERY AGGRESSIVELY
        BECAUSE SCHOOLS REPRESENT
      

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:30.370

        ONE OF THE FEW RELATIVELY
        AD-FREE ENVIRONMENTS
      

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.070

        LEFT IN OUR CULTURE.


00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.970

        PARENTS WOULD BE SHOCKED IF
        THEY SAW SOME OF THE MATERIALS
      

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.470

        THAT ARE SENT TO SCHOOLS


00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.510

        ALLEGEDLY TO HELP
        THEIR CHILDREN LEARN.
      

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.940

        THEY ARE REALLY
        CORPORATE COME-ONS.
      

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.820

        Simon:
        SCHOOLCHILDREN DISCUSS
	GOOD AND BAD HAIR DAYS
      

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.080

        WITH MATERIALS
        PROVIDED BY REVLON.
      

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.790

        THEY STUDY GEOTHERMAL ENERGY
        BY EATING GUSHERS FRUIT SNACKS.
      

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.520

        IT IS LAUGHABLE ON ITS FACE


00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.090

        THAT CORPORATE EXECUTIVES
        WHO GO AROUND THUMPING THE TUB
      

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.230

        FOR WORLD-CLASS
        ACADEMIC STANDARDS
      

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.330

        SIGN OFF ON PROGRAMS
        THAT WOULD SERIOUSLY PROPOSE
      

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.300

        THAT CHILDREN SHOULD LEARN
        THE HISTORY OF TOOTSIE ROLLS.
      

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.440

        Reporter:
        Kansas governor Bill Graves
      

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.210

        will appoint someone
        to the vacancy
      

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.080

        maybe as early as next week.


00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.210

        Simon:
        IN THOUSANDS
	OF AMERICAN SCHOOLS
      

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:17.320

        STUDENTS MUST WATCH CHANNEL 1,

	COMES COMMERCIALS.
      

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.960

        COMPANIES PAY UP TO $200,000

        TO PLACE A SINGLE AD
        ON CHANNEL 1
      

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.200

        BECAUSE THEY'RE PROMISED


00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.470

        A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE
        OF MILLIONS OF CHILDREN.
      

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:42.370

        NOW, COMMERCIALS ARE ENTERING
        AMERICA'S SCHOOLS IN OTHER WAYS.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.410

        Simon:
        AT NORTH JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL,
	THEY CALL THIS THE 7-UP BUS.
      

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.510

        IT'S ONE OF SEVERAL
        IN THE CITY OF COLORADO SPRINGS
      

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:53.850

        WHICH HAVE ADS PAINTED
        BOLDLY ON THEIR SIDES.
      

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:56.420

        NO ONE ELSE EVER PUT ADS
        ON THEIR SCHOOL BUSES.
      

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.390

        WE'RE THE FIRST ONES TO DO IT.


00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.690

        Simon:
        COLORADO SPRINGS IS A
	PROSPEROUS, RAPIDLY GROWING CITY
      

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:06.930

        BUT FOR YEARS, THE SCHOOLS HERE
        HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF AFFLUENZA.
      

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.200

        Burnley:
        PEOPLE TEND TO SAY,
	"I'LL BUY A BOAT
      

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.640

        INSTEAD OF GIVING MONEY
        TO THE SCHOOLS."
      

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.610

        A SCHOOL LEVY HAS NOT PASSED
        HERE FOR CAPITAL SINCE 1972
      

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.640

        AND FOR OPERATIONS SINCE 1969.


00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.110

        Simon:
        SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT KENNETH
	BURNLEY TURNED TO ADVERTISERS
      

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.850

        TO INCREASE REVENUES.


00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.520

        AT WASSON HIGH SCHOOL, MOST OF
        THE ADS ARE FOR THE SNACK FOODS
      

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:36.930

        THAT STUDENTS ARE WARNED AGAINST
        IN THEIR HEALTH CLASSES.
      

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:41.460

        Man:
        WE ARE ALLOWING THINGS
	TO CREEP IN ONE BY ONE
      

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.940

        THAT DISTRACT FROM LEARNING.


00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.110

        I THINK THERE IS A GREAT DEAL
        MORE EMPHASIS BY STUDENTS
      

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:49.640

        ON MATERIALISM.


00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.510

        I'M AFRAID THE WAY
        OUR NATION IS GOING
      

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.850

        WE ARE BECOMING PREOCCUPIED
        WITH MATERIAL THINGS
      

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.620

        AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR CHILDREN.


00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.920

        Galambos:
        DO YOU FEEL
      

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.250

        IF YOU'RE NOT WEARING
        THE LATEST, THE BEST
      

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:06.060

        THAT WOULD HURT
        YOUR SELF-ESTEEM?
      

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.160

        I DO.


00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.360

        Student:
        IF YOU WEAR
	SOMETHING GENERIC
      

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.490

        YOU FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY'S
        LOOKING AT YOU.
      

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:13.770

        YOU NOTICE EVERYBODY
        ELSE WEARING NIKE.
      

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:14.930

        SO IT IS
        A BIG DEAL.
      

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:16.130

        All:
        YES!
      

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.400

        Simon:
        OF COURSE MANY YOUNG AMERICANS
      

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.940

        ARE ADOPTING CONSUMERISM
        AS THEIR CREDO--
      

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.870

        SO MANY OF THE ADULTS THEY SEE


00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.910

        ARE ALREADY IN
        ABOVE THEIR HEADS.
      

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.910

        Man:
        THE WEDDING WAS SO GOOD;
	WE ALMOST HAVE IT PAID OFF.
      

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:33.180

        Woman:
        AND THAT'S WHERE THE WHOLE BALL
	STARTED ROLLING.
      

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:37.390

        WE STARTED OUT THINKING
        WE COULD FINANCE THE WORLD
      

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:43.330

        AND WE TRIED,
        BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.
      

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.260

        Simon:
        THE STORY OF THE ADAMS FAMILY
	OF COLORADO SPRINGS
      

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.530

        IS ONE THAT'S BECOME ALL TOO
        FAMILIAR THROUGHOUT AMERICA.
      

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.000

        Keaton:
        18, I GOT A MERVYN'S CREDIT CARD
      

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.910

        AND WITH THAT I MANAGED
        TO GET MY VISA CARD
      

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.640

        AND THEN CINDY MANAGED
        TO GET HER VISA CARD
      

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.810

        AND WE ENDED UP WITH LOTS
        OF VISA CARDS TO BEGIN WITH.
      

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.080

        Simon:
        KEATON AND CINDY ADAMS
	MARRIED IN 1990
      

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.320

        AND SOON BEGAN BUYING
        LOTS OF THINGS FOR THEIR HOME
      

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.680

        ALL ON CREDIT.


00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.250

        Cindy:
        FURNITURE, COUCHES, LOVESEAT
      

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:14.030

        END TABLE, COFFEE TABLES,
        ENTERTAINMENT CENTER.
      

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.630

        Keaton:
        WHAT'S ANOTHER $25 A MONTH?
      

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.190

        THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.


00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.330

        THEN WE FOUND OURSELVES MAKING
        MINIMUM PAYMENTS EVERYWHERE.
      

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.170

        TO THE POINT
        WHERE WE COULDN'T.
      

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.940

        AND THEN WHEN WE STARTED
        TO GET TWO MONTHS BEHIND
      

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.700

        THREE MONTHS BEHIND


00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.470

        THE ARGUMENTS ENSUED,
        WE STARTED FIGHTING.
      

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.310

        Simon:
        THEY WERE $20,000 IN DEBT.
      

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.350

        Keaton:
        WE WERE SCREAMING "DIVORCE."
      

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:38.050

        FINALLY WE JUST ENDED UP
        REACHING A BREAKING POINT.
      

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.380

        Keaton:
        IT'S THE CAR.
      

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.380

        SO WHAT DID THEY SAY?


00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.650

        COULD BE 600.


00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:43.450

        Simon:
        IN 90% OF DIVORCE CASES
      

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.420

        ARGUMENTS ABOUT MONEY
        PLAY A PROMINENT ROLE.
      

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.430

        KEATON AND CINDY
        DIDN'T GET DIVORCED;
      

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:51.230

        THEY GOT HELP WHEN A DEBT
        COLLECTOR REFERRED THEM
      

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.430

        TO CONSUMER CREDIT COUNSELING.


00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:57.040

        SEE IF SOMETHING'S SET UP
        TO REPAY THIS DEBT.
      

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.540

        THE CLIENTS HAD APPARENTLY
        FINANCED SOME MEDICAL BILLS.
      

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.540

        COULD YOU HAVE HIM CALL
        CONSUMER CREDIT COUNSELING?
      

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.470

        Simon:
        THE PHONES ARE BUSY
      

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:06.410

        AT CONSUMER CREDIT
        COUNSELING SERVICE
      

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.150

        AN INTERNATIONAL NETWORK


00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.350

        WITH HUNDREDS OF OFFICES
        THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.
      

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:14.950

        Woman:
        WHEN A PERSON COMES
	TO CONSUMER CREDIT COUNSELING
      

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.260

        THE FIRST THING WE DO
        IS CUT UP THE CREDIT CARDS.
      

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.960

        THAT WHOLE AVAILABILITY
        AND EASE OF USE OF CREDIT
      

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.690

        MAKES IT REAL HARD FOR PEOPLE


00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.200

        TO REMEMBER THEY'RE
        DEALING WITH REAL MONEY.
      

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.000

        Simon:
        AMERICANS POSSESS MORE
	THAN A BILLION CREDIT CARDS.
      

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.040

        FEWER THAN A THIRD OF US PAY OFF
        OUR BALANCES EACH MONTH.
      

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.970

        CREDIT CARD DEBT
        TRIPLED IN THE 1980s.
      

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.040

        NOT INCLUDING REAL ESTATE
        AND MORTGAGES
      

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.010

        WE'RE CARRYING OVER
        A TRILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT.
      

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.380

        Simon:
        IN 1996, MORE THAN
	A MILLION AMERICANS
      

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.420

        DECLARED PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY--


00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.090

        MORE THAN GRADUATED
        FROM COLLEGE.
      

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.920

        Announcer:
        DO YOU HAVE MONEY JITTERS?
      

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.460

        ASK THE OBLIGING BANK OF
        AMERICA
      

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.230

        FOR A JAR OF SOOTHING
        INSTANT MONEY--
      

00:24:56.230 --> 00:25:00.360

        M-O-N-E-Y IN THE FORM OF
        A CONVENIENT PERSONAL LOAN.
      

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.130

        Simon:
        WHEN THIS COMMERCIAL WAS MADE,
	AMERICANS EARNED HALF AS MUCH
      

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.800

        BUT SAVED TWICE AS MUCH
        AS THEY DO NOW.
      

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.910

        OUR PERSONAL SAVINGS RATE
        IS NOW 4%.
      

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:14.110

        BY CONTRAST, THE JAPANESE
        SAVE 16% OF THEIR WAGES.
      

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.050

        STILL, FOR AMERICANS


00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:20.320

        THE MESSAGE TO SPEND
        EVEN MORE IS INCESSANT.
      

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.750

        THE CREDIT CARD OFFERS
        KEEP COMING
      

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.560

        WITH ENTICEMENTS RANGING
        FROM TEMPORARY LOW RATES
      

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.790

        TO FREQUENT FLYER MILES.


00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:29.660

        Woman:
        AND HOW ARE YOU?
      

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.690

        Simon:
        EACH MONTH, CINDY ADAMS DEPOSITS
      

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:34.600

        A CHECK AT CONSUMER CREDIT
        COUNSELING TO PAY OFF DEBTS.
      

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.230

        SHE'S LEARNED A HARD LESSON.


00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:40.910

        Cindy:
        IT'S OKAY NOT TO HAVE THE NEWEST
	THING, THE LATEST STYLE.
      

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:45.010

        OUR HOME DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
        TIP-TOP '90s CONDITION.
      

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:48.250

        IT LETS US FOCUS ON THINGS THAT
        ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN STUFF.
      

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.480

        Simon:
        BUT CINDY AND KEATON
	STILL FEEL CAUGHT
      

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.680

        WHEN THEY THINK
        ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN.
      

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.850

        Keaton:
        EVEN BRANDON AT THREE
	IS NOW GOING TO PICK OUT STUFF:
      

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:57.960

        "MOMMY, WHY CAN'T I HAVE IT?"


00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.690

        AND THAT'S JUST
        THE WAY THINGS ARE.
      

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.930

        Simon:
        AND THAT TROUBLES GLENN STANTON
	OF "FOCUS ON THE FAMILY."
      

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:06.100

        Stanton:
        THE PRESSURE THAT MATERIALISM
      

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.070

        IS BRINGING TO BEAR
        ON THE AMERICAN FAMILY TODAY
      

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:15.840

        IS WOEFULLY UNDERESTIMATED
        BUT IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.
      

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.840

        FOCUS ON THE FAMILY,
        THIS IS CATHY.
      

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.010

        MAY I HELP YOU?


00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:20.740

        Simon:
        FOUNDED BY DR. JAMES DOBSON
      

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.610

        WHOSE RADIO PROGRAM
        REACHES MILLIONS
      

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:24.050

        FOCUS ON THE FAMILY


00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.650

        IS THE LARGEST CHRISTIAN
        CONSERVATIVE ORGANIZATION
      

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.350

        IN THE UNITED STATES.


00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.260

        THE POLITICAL IDEOLOGY HERE
        IS FREE-MARKET CAPITALISM
      

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.160

        THOUGH NOT WITHOUT RESERVATIONS.


00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:37.230

        Stanton:
        THE MARKET IN A VERY REAL SENSE
	IS HOSTILE TO THE FAMILY.
      

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:38.830

        IT NEEDS TO EXPAND ITSELF.


00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:41.230

        IT NEEDS TO BRING
        IN NEW CONSUMERS.
      

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:44.470

        AND QUITE TRAGICALLY
        IT BRINGS IN NEW CONSUMERS
      

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:46.470

        ALMOST AT ANY PRICE.


00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:51.640

        DO WE GO OUT AFTER A SALE EVEN
        PITTING CHILD AGAINST PARENT?
      

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.680

        WE WOULD CONTEND
        THAT THAT IS TOO FAR.
      

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.210

        Simon:
        STRONG FAMILIES
	SPEND TIME TOGETHER.
      

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:59.350

        BUT THAT'S LESS COMMON
        IN OUR CONSUMER SOCIETY
      

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:01.950

        EVEN WHEN PARENTS
        ARE NOT WORKING.
      

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:07.090

        Stanton:
        MOM'S UPSTAIRS WATCHING
	A MOVIE ON THE V.C.R.
      

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:08.760

        DAD IS ON THE INTERNET.


00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.160

        THE KIDS ARE DOWNSTAIRS
        PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.
      

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.730

        EVERYBODY IS CONNECTED
        TO SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF THE HOME
      

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:16.330

        THOUGH THEY'RE PHYSICALLY
        WITHIN THE HOME.
      

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:23.610

        Choir:
         I HAVE A DESTINY
	 I KNOW I SHALL FULFILL
      

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:29.580

         I HAVE A DESTINY
        IN THAT CITY ON A HILL 
      

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.250

         I HAVE A DESTINY...


00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:36.250

        Simon:
        NEW LIFE CHURCH IS LESS THAN
	A MILE FROM FOCUS ONF THE FAMILY.
      

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.490

        SUNDAY SERVICES HERE


00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:41.060

        ATTRACT THOUSANDS
        OF EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS.
      

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.260

        Minister:
        THE BIBLE DOES NOT SAY
      

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.860

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:48.330

        IT SAYS, "KEEP YOUR LIVES
        FREE FROM THE LOVE OF MONEY
      

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.500

        AND BE CONTENT."


00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:54.240

        NOW, THE MESSAGE OF OUR DAY
        IN OUR SOCIETY RIGHT NOW
      

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.570

        IS ALWAYS, ALWAYS
        BE DISCONTENT.
      

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:59.580

        WE HAVE TREMENDOUS PROSPERITY
        IN OUR COUNTRY
      

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.250

        AND WE'VE NEVER PROBABLY
        HAD SO MUCH DISCONTENT.
      

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:03.310

        Simon:
        PASTOR TED HAGGARD
      

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:05.580

        LIKE HIS NEIGHBORS
        AT FOCUS ON THE FAMILY
      

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.420

        IS A FREE-ENTERPRISE
        CONSERVATIVE
      

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.350

        BUT HE, TOO, FEELS


00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:13.960

        THAT CONSUMERISM IS BECOMING
        A POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR FAMILY.
      

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.890

        THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE
        RUSHING, RUSHING, RUSHING
      

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:20.630

        TRYING TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE,
        AND... THAT'S GOT TO STOP.
      

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.170

        OUR KIDS NEED IT.


00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:25.740

        OUR WIVES, HUSBANDS,
        GRANDMA AND GRANDPA NEED IT.
      

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.900

        Haggard:
        YES!
      

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.440

        Haggard:
        IT IS NOT WORTH
      

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.840

        HAVING ANOTHER THOUSAND
        SQUARE FEET IN YOUR HOUSE
      

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.180

        IF YOU LOSE THE RELATIONSHIP
        WITH YOUR WIFE
      

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:37.380

        OR IF YOUR CHILD TURNS 16 AND
        YOU REALIZE YOU NEVER MET HIM.
      

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.750

        HEY, NO, DON'T EAT THE...
        NO, DON'T EAT THE WORD.
      

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:44.360

        Simon:
        WITH A LITTLE HELP,
	PASTOR TED PREPARES A SERMON.
      

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.990

        FOR HIM, BEING CONSERVATIVE
        MEANS CONSERVING.
      

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:49.360

        Haggard:
        THE WHOLE IDEA OF US
	USING A THING
      

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.230

        AND THEN THROWING IT AWAY
        AND GETTING ANOTHER ONE,
      

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.600

        I THINK IS AFFECTING
        ALL OF US AS PEOPLE.
      

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.030

        WE START LOOKING
        AT OTHER PEOPLE AND WE SAY
      

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.670

        IF THEY DON'T GIVE US PLEASURE,
        THEN THEY ARE DISPOSABLE.
      

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.610

        I THINK IT CAN'T HELP
        BUT CARRY OVER
      

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:06.280

        INTO RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE,
        THAT I'M DISSATISFIED WITH THIS;
      

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.810

        THERE'S GOT TO BE
        SOMEBODY BETTER OUT THERE.
      

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.010

        Man:
        I SEE THAT A LOT
	IN MY PRACTICE
      

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:12.580

        WHERE PEOPLE WILL COME IN
        AND SAY
      

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.280

        WELL, THEY MET SOMEONE AT WORK


00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.850

        OR, YOU KNOW, "OUR RELATIONSHIP
        STARTED AT WORK
      

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.260

        "AND THEN EVENTUALLY
        WE DIVORCED OUR SPOUSES
      

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.860

        AND WE GOT TOGETHER."


00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.430

        ONCE THE
        WRAPPING WAS OFF
      

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:25.130

        THEN IT WASN'T AS NEW
        AND DIFFERENT AND WONDERFUL
      

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.000

        AS IT WAS IN THE VERY BEGINNING


00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.730

        WHEN EVERYONE WAS DRESSED UP
        AND POWDERED
      

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:31.000

        AND LOOKED PERFECT.


00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.600

        SO THEY GO BACK TO THE COMPANY


00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.140

        AND FIND SOME OTHER TOY
        TO PLAY WITH.
      

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.470

        ( people exchanging farewells )


00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.140

        Simon:
        OUR COMMUNITY BONDS ALSO SUFFER.
      

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.980

        THE SALVATION ARMY REPORTS
        DIFFICULTY
      

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.310

        FINDING VOLUNTEER BELL RINGERS.


00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.620

        PARTICIPATION IN CIVIC
        ORGANIZATIONS AND ACTIVITIES
      

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.980

        HAS BEEN DECLINING
        OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS.
      

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.660

        Stanton:
        ALL OUR ATTENTION IS BEING
	PULLED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.
      

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.990

        IN TRYING TO RUN THAT RAT RACE,
        WE DON'T HAVE TIME
      

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:59.100

        TO VOLUNTEER DOWN AT THE SOUP
        KITCHEN, TO VOLUNTEER AT CHURCH
      

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.300

        TO GO VISIT THE OLD FOLKS' HOME


00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:09.040

        TO PAY SOME TIME AND ATTENTION
        TO PEOPLE WHO NEED US.
      

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.010

        Simon:
        AFFLUENZA AFFECTS PEOPLE
	ACROSS ALL INCOME BARRIERS:
      

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.310

        PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT
        BUT WANT MORE
      

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:19.280

        THEN FEEL THEMSELVES ALMOST
        EMPTY INSIDE ONCE THEY GET MORE
      

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.180

        AND PEOPLE WHO WANT
        FOR LIFE'S BASICS
      

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.390

        BUT STILL FEEL THEMSELVES
        ALMOST TAUNTED
      

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:24.950

        BY GLITTERING EMBELLISHMENTS.


00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.360

        AND IN RECENT YEARS


00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.060

        THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS
        HAS BEEN GROWING.
      

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:32.800

        IN FACT, THE GAP BETWEEN RICH
        AND POOR AMERICANS IS NOW
      

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.400

        THE WIDEST IN ANY
        INDUSTRIAL NATION.
      

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.430

        LOW-INCOME PEOPLE SEE IT
        AS AN ISSUE OF INEQUITY:
      

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:41.440

        HOW IS IT THAT I SEE
        ALL THESE PEOPLE AROUND ME
      

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.080

        GETTING WEALTHIER AND WEALTHIER,
        DOING BETTER AND BETTER
      

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.210

        GAINING MORE AND MORE
        MATERIAL GOODS
      

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:50.850

        AT A TIME WHEN I'M FALLING
        FARTHER AND FARTHER BEHIND?
      

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:56.190

        IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE BIG
        CONSUMER BOOM SINCE THE 1980s
      

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.320

        I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS
        YOU'LL FIND
      

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.660

        IS THAT IT'S FAIRLY
        HEAVILY CONCENTRATED
      

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.960

        IN THE UPPER PART
        OF THE MIDDLE CLASS AND ABOVE.
      

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.530

        Simon:
        FELICIA EDWARDS DIDN'T SHARE
	IN THE BOOM.
      

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.970

        SHE AND HER TWO SONS LIVE
        IN A TINY APARTMENT
      

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:11.370

        IN HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT.


00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:12.940

        ( sighing heavily )


00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.070

        Simon:
        LIKE MANY LOW-INCOME AMERICANS
      

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:17.640

        FELICIA WORKS FULL TIME
        AND THEN SOME
      

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.680

        BUT STILL STRUGGLES
        TO PROVIDE FOR HER CHILDREN.
      

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:25.950

        Edwards:
        I TRY TO TEACH THEM, YOU KNOW,
	A DOLLAR IS HARD TO COME BY ...
      

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.220

        WELL, TO ME IT IS.


00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.050

        CHRISTMAS ROLLS AROUND:
        "CAN YOU BUY ME THIS?"
      

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:32.920

        BUT WHATEVER I GIVE THEM,
        THEY'RE FINE WITH IT.
      

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.190

        THEY DON'T ASK ANOTHER QUESTION.


00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:37.260

        MONEY IS NOT ALL THAT IMPORTANT.


00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:42.530

        I MEAN, WE CAN'T BUY CERTAIN
        THINGS, BUT STILL, WE'RE HAPPY.
      

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:44.200

        WE'RE OKAY WITH IT.


00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.570

        Announcer:
        It's "Rocko's
	MODERN LIFE..."
      

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:50.210

        Simon:
        YET FELICIA KNOWS HER BOYS
	FREQUENTLY FEEL DEPRIVED.
      

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:51.940

        NOT LONG AGO,
        ONE OF THEM BEGGED HER
      

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.040

        FOR A PAIR
        OF EXPENSIVE SNEAKERS.
      

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.910

        Edwards:
        THEY WERE $90.
      

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:59.980

        I HAD TO EXPLAIN TO HIM FIRST
        THAT I COULDN'T AFFORD THEM
      

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.180

        SO HE WASN'T GOING TO GET THEM.


00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.120

        BUT ME AND HIS AUNT
        CAME TO A DECISION
      

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:10.260

        THAT WE WAS GOING TO GO HALF
        ON THEM AND HE GOT THE SNEAKERS.
      

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:14.800

        Simon:
        IN OUR POOREST COMMUNITIES, THE
	SENSE OF DEPRIVATION IS INTENSE.
      

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.030

        Celente:
        THERE WAS A FELLOW THAT I MET
      

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:18.130

        AND HE WORKS WITH GANGS


00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:21.200

        AND I ASKED HIM, "WHAT'S
        THE ONE THING THAT YOU SEE
      

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.710

        THAT'S CAUSING A LOT
        OF THESE PROBLEMS?"
      

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:28.510

        WITHOUT SKIPPING A BEAT, HE
        SAID, "GREED AND MATERIALISM."
      

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:29.780

        HE SAID


00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.580

        "THESE KIDS, THEY DON'T FEEL
        LIKE THEIR LIVES
      

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.980

        "WOULD BE WORTH ANYTHING UNLESS
        THEY HAD THE HOTTEST PRODUCT
      

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.660

        THAT'S BEING SOLD
        IN THE MARKETPLACE."
      

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:42.490

        Simon:
        SOON, CHILDREN THROUGHOUT
	THE WORLD MAY FEEL THE SMAE WAY.
      

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:46.260

        Man:
        THE WHOLE CORPORATE SYSTEM
	IN THE COURSE OF GLOBALIZATION
      

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:49.970

        IS INCREASINGLY GEARED UP
        TO BRING EVERY COUNTRY
      

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:52.040

        INTO THE CONSUMER SOCIETY.


00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.070

        AND THERE'S
        A VERY STRONG EMPHASIS
      

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:55.910

        ON TRYING TO REACH CHILDREN


00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:59.240

        TO RESHAPE THEIR VALUES
        FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
      

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.550

        TO CONVINCE THEM THAT PROGRESS
        IS DEFINED BY WHAT THEY CONSUME.
      

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:06.880

        Simon:
        EACH DAY, TELEVISION
	EXPOSES MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
      

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.150

        TO THE CONSUMER DREAM
      

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:12.460

        AND THEY ARE EAGER
        TO BE INCLUDED.
      

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.720

        DAVID KORTEN ONCE BELIEVED
        THEY COULD, AND SHOULD.
      

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.530

        HE'S WORKED IN AFRICA, ASIA
        AND CENTRAL AMERICA
      

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:20.660

        FOR THE HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL,
        THE FORD FOUNDATION

        MY CAREER WAS FOCUSED
	ON TRAINING BUSINESS EXECUTIVES
      

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:31.580

        TO CREATE THE EQUIVALENT OF
        OUR HIGH-CONSUMPTION ECONOMIES
      

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.210

        IN COUNTRIES
        THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
      

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.240

        GRADUALLY I REALIZED
        THAT THAT WASN'T WORKING
      

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.810

        AND COULDN'T WORK.


00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:40.420

        MANY PEOPLE'S LIVES
        WERE ACTUALLY WORSE OFF
      

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.050

        THAT WE WERE SEEING
        THE ENVIRONMENT TRASHED.
      

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:49.220

        WE WERE SEEING THE BREAKDOWN OF
        CULTURES AND THE SOCIAL FABRIC.
      

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:53.160

	LIVE IN ABJECT POVERTY
      

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.730

        DYING SLOWLY OF HUNGER
        AND DISEASE.
      

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:59.070

        MILLIONS OF OTHERS
        ALSO DESPERATELY NEED
      

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.570

        MORE MATERIAL GOODS.


00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:02.870

        YET WERE THEY TO CONSUME
        AS MUCH AS WE DO
      

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:06.810

        THE RESULT COULD BE
        AN ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS.
      

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:10.510

        THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY
        THAT EVERYONE IN THE WORLD
      

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:13.080

        CAN LIVE AT THAT STANDARD
        OF AFFLUENCE
      

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.450

        BECAUSE THE EARTH'S ECOSYSTEM
        SIMPLY WILL NOT STAND IT.
      

00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:19.320

        IMAGINE IF EVERY CHINESE
        HOUSEHOLD HAD TWO CARS.
      

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.530

        Simon:

	IN BEIJING REVEALS
      

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.890

        THEY'RE ALREADY ON THAT ROAD.


00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:25.930

        WESTERN PRODUCTS AND ADVERTISING


00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:28.200

        DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
      

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.330

        IT IS CREATING A GROUNDWORK
        FOR A GLOBAL DISASTER.
      

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:33.800

        Simon:
        COMBINED WITH
	A POPULATION EXPLOSION
      

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.770

        NOT EXPECTED TO PEAK
        FOR DECADES
      

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:39.580

        THE CONSUMPTION BOOM THREATENS
        TO DEVOUR THE WORLD'S RESERVES
      

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.210

        OF OIL AND OTHER RESOURCES


00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:44.150

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.550

        WE'VE SET THE EXAMPLE.

        THE AMERICAN CONSUMER.
      

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:51.220

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:59.490

        Simon:
        SINCE 1950, AMERICANS ALONE
	HAVE USED MORE RESOURCES
      

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:18.310

        THAN EVERYONE WHO EVER LIVED
        BEFORE THEM.
      

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:23.420

        EACH OF US USES UP TO 20 TONS
        OF BASIC RAW MATERIALS ANNUALLY.
      

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.960

        ONLY A SMALL FRACTION
        GETS RECYCLED.
      

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.030

        Korten:
        WE ARE RUTHLESSLY CUTTING DOWN
	THE WORLD'S FORESTS
      

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:32.660

        DEGRADING OUR LANDS,
        DESTROYING THE CLIMATIC SYSTEMS
      

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.600

        ALL IN THE QUEST FOR MONEY.


00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.100

        Simon:
        WE AMERICANS THROW AWAY
	SEVEN MILLION CARS A YEAR
      

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.400

        TWO MILLION PLASTIC BOTTLES
        EVERY HOUR
      

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:45.780

        ENOUGH ALUMINUM CANS ANNUALLY
        TO MAKE 6,000 DC-10 AIRLINERS.
      

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:50.180

        THE TOTAL YEARLY WASTE WOULD
        FILL A CONVOY OF GARBAGE TRUCKS
      

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:55.950

        LONG ENOUGH TO REACH
        HALFWAY TO THE MOON.
      

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.760

        OUR RIVERS AND OCEANS ARE
        ALREADY CLOTTED WITH POLLUTION.
      

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.760

        INCREASED EMISSIONS OF
        CARBON DIOXIDE AND OTHER GASES
      

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.300

	OF CONSUMERISM
      

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.570

        IS SPREADING AROUND THE WORLD


00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:14.200

        SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT
        WE HERE IN NORTH AMERICA BEGIN
      

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.440

        TO ALTER OUR PATTERNS
        OF CONSUMPTION
      

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:19.110

        AND SET A BETTER EXAMPLE
        FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD
      

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.840

        OF WHAT THE GOOD LIFE REALLY IS


00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:24.180

        OR NONE OF US ARE GOING TO HAVE
        A GOOD LIFE.
      

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.450

        Simon:
        ACCORDING TO HISTORIAN
	DAVID SHI
      

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:30.620

        THE IDEA THAT THE GOOD LIFE IS
        A SIMPLER, LESS ACQUISITIVE LIFE
      

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.390

        RUNS DEEP IN OUR HERITAGE.


00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:36.260

        Shi:
        SIMPLICITY IS AN ANCIENT,
	EVEN A PRIMORDIAL IDEAL.
      

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.760

        THE GREEKS REFERRED TO IT
        AS THE "MIDDLE WAY"--
      

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:42.030

        THAT MIDPOINT BETWEEN
        LUXURY AND DEPRIVATION.
      

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:44.630

        Simon:

	NOR RICHES"
      

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.300

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.570

        THE NEW TESTAMENT IS FILLED
        WITH WARNINGS
      

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:50.170

        ABOUT THE DANGERS OF WEALTH.


00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:52.940

        Shi:
        SO WHEN THE PURITANS ARRIVED
	IN THE NEW WORLD
      

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.910

        ONE OF THEIR MAJOR PREMISES
        WAS THEIR DESIRE
      

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:58.680

        TO TRY TO CREATE
        A CHRISTIAN COMMONWEALTH
      

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.920

        THAT PRACTICED SIMPLE LIVING.


00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:04.290

        Simon:

	WROTE BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
      

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:05.820

        IN COLONIAL AMERICA


00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:09.130

        HABITS OF THRIFT PERSISTED
        ALONGSIDE DESIRES FOR LUXURY.
      

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:10.960

        EVEN 19th-CENTURY AMERICANS


00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.730

        STILL HAD MORE RESPECT FOR
        THRIFT THAN FOR SPENDTHRIFTS
      

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:17.770

        AND THE WORD "CONSUMPTION"
        MEANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT THEN.
      

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:20.500

        Rifkin:
        IF YOU GO BACK TO SAMUEL
	JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY
      

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.240

        OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE,
        "TO CONSUME" MEANT "TO EXHAUST
      

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.170

        TO PILLAGE, TO LAY RENT,
        TO DESTROY."
      

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.640

        IN FACT, EVEN IN OUR
        GRANDPARENTS' GENERATION
      

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.880

        WHEN SOMEBODY HAD TUBERCULOSIS,
        THEY CALLED IT "CONSUMPTION."
      

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.520

        SO, UP UNTIL THIS CENTURY


00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.450

        TO BE A CONSUMER WAS
        NOT TO BE A GOOD THING.
      

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:37.720

        IT WAS CONSIDERED A BAD THING.


00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.490

        Simon:
        ONE OF THE FIRST HARBINGERS
	OF A CHANGE OF HEART
      

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:41.990

        WAS THE DEPARTMENT STORE.


00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:46.100

        Woman:
        URBAN DEPARTMENT STORES CAME IN
	DURING THE 1880'S
      

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.360

        BASICALLY TO CREATE THE SORT
        OF PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WOULD GO
      

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.530

        AND KIND OF LOSE THEMSELVES
        AND SPEND THEIR MONEY.
      

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:55.840

        Simon:
        BY THE 1890s, WEALTHY AMERICANS
	PROUDLY DISPLAYED
      

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.140

        THE MATERIAL SIGNS
        OF THEIR SUCCESS.
      

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.540

        STILL, NOT EVERYONE
        WAS IMPRESSED.
      

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:04.450

        Shi:
        IN THE LATE 19th CENTURY,
	THER WAS ANOTHER MAJOR REVIVAL
      

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:06.920

        OF AMERICAN INTEREST
        IN SIMPLE LIVING.
      

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:10.050

        THEODORE ROOSEVELT WAS ONE
        OF THE FOREMOST PROPONENTS
      

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:13.220

        OF A SIMPLER LIFE FOR AMERICANS
        DURING THIS PERIOD.
      

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.520

        ROOSEVELT WAS QUITE CANDID
        IN SAYING
      

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.730

        THAT FOR ALL OF HIS SUPPORT
        FOR AMERICAN CAPITALISM
      

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:22.400

        HE FEARED THAT IF IT WERE
        ALLOWED TO DEVELOP UNLEASHED
      

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:26.140

        IT WOULD EVENTUALLY CREATE
        A CORRUPT CIVILIZATION.
      

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:30.270

        Simon:

	IN LARGE QUANTITIES
      

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:32.810

        LABOR AND RELIGIOUS
        LEADERS URGED
      

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:37.280

        THAT PRODUCTIVE
        NEW TECHNOLOGIES BE USED
      

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.220

        TO GIVE PEOPLE MORE FREE TIME
        INSTEAD OF MORE POSSESSIONS.
      

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:44.690

        BUT BUSINESS EXECUTIVES FEARED
        A LAG IN CONSUMER DEMAND
      

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:46.960

        MIGHT SEND THE WHOLE ECONOMY
        CRASHING DOWN.
      

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.390

        THEY CLAIMED THAT HUMAN WANTS
        WERE INSATIABLE
      

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:52.300

        AND LOOKED TO PSYCHOLOGY
        TO STIMULATE SPENDING.
      

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.760

        Announcer:
        WHY FEEL LOW?
      

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.260

        WHY BE A LITTLE GUY?


00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:58.300

        NOW YOU CAN BE JUST AS TALL
        AS YOUR BEST GIRL.
      

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.370

        SLIP INTO A PAIR
        OF UPSY-DAISY SHOES.
      

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:03.440

        THEY GIVE YOU A LIFT.


00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.140

        Simon:
        AFTER THE GREAT DEPRESSION
	AND WORLD WAR II
      

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:09.410

        A LIFT WAS JUST WHAT
        AMERICANS WANTED
      

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:12.250

        AND BUSINESS WAS EAGER
        TO PROVIDE IT--
      

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:14.220

        WITH SOME HELP
        FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
      

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:17.290

        Film narrator:
        NEW AUTOMOBILES STREAM
	FROM THE FACTORIES.
      

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:18.720

        FRESH BUYING POWER


00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.890

        FLOODS INTO ALL THE STORES
        OF EVERY COMMUNITY.
      

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:26.160

        PROSPERITY GREATER
        THAN HISTORY HAS EVER KNOWN.
      

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:30.400

        Simon:
        LOW-INTEREST FEDERAL LOANS
	AND SPENDING ON SUPERHIGHWAYS
      

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.470

        FUELED THE SUBURBAN
        HOUSING BOOM.
      

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:36.110

        THE EXPANSION OF CREDIT MADE
        LARGE CONSUMER PURCHASES EASIER
      

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:38.840

        AND THE GOOD LIFE BECAME
        THE GOODS LIFE.
      

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.580

        Film narrator:
        WE HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND
      

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.750

        AND WE WANT ALL
        THE LOVELY-SMELLING SOAPS
      

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.950

        LOTIONS AND GLAMOUR GOO
        WE CAN GET WITH IT.
      

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:49.950

        OUR EGOS ARE BEST NOURISHED
        BY A WELL-PLACED INVESTMENT
      

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:51.350

        IN REAL LUXURY GOODS--


00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:55.030

        WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL
        DISCREETLY CONSPICUOUS WASTE.
      

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:56.760

        Strasser:
        THE IMMEDIATE POSTWAR PERIOD
      

00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:01.430

        DOES REPRESENT A HUGE CHANGE
        IN THE KINDS OF ATTITUDES
      

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:05.200

        THAT AMERICANS HAVE HAD
        ABOUT CONSUMPTION.
      

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.240

        Simon:
        CONVENIENCE WAS THE NEW IDEAL,
	DISPOSABLE THE MEANS--
      

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.910

        USE IT ONCE AND THROW IT AWAY.


00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.810

        FAMILIES WERE ENCOURAGED
        TO BUY A NEW CAR EVERY YEAR.
      

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:17.580

        MARKETERS CALLED IT
        "PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE."
      

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.980

        PRODUCTS BECAME OBSOLETE
        BECAUSE THEY WERE OUT OF STYLE
      

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.120

        WHETHER THEY STILL
        WORKED OR NOT.
      

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.990

        Strasser:
        THEY WERE SAYING THE CAR YOU HAD
	LAST YEAR WON'T DO ANYMORE
      

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:29.160

        BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT.


00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.590

        THERE'S NOW A NEW CAR


00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:33.160

        AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT
        TO BE DRIVING.
      

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:36.970

        Simon:
        CONSUMER SOCIETY WAS TRIUMPHANT,
	BUT NOT WITHOUT CRITICS.
      

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:40.870

        IN THE 1960s, A SMALL
        BUT VOCAL COUNTERCULTURE
      

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:43.140

        CALLED FOR A SIMPLER WAY
        OF LIFE.
      

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:46.480

        THEN IN 1974, A NATIONWIDE
        OIL SHORTAGE CAUSED MANY PEOPLE
      

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.380

        TO WONDER IF WE MIGHT
        RUN OUT OF RESOURCES.
      

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.710

        AND BY 1979


00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:54.780

        EVEN OUR PRESIDENT WAS
        QUESTIONING THE AMERICAN DREAM.
      

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:59.160

        TOO MANY OF US NOW TEND
        TO WORSHIP SELF-INDULGENCE
      

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:01.020

        AND CONSUMPTION.


00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:06.390

        PART OF JIMMY CARTER'S FAILURE
        WAS HIS LACK OF RECOGNITION
      

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:10.570

        OF HOW DEEPLY SEATED THE
        HIGH, WIDE AND HANDSOME NOTION
      

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:14.640

        OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND
        CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT HAD BECOME
      

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.070

        IN THE MODERN AMERICAN PSYCHE.


00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:19.470

        Simon:
        SINCE CARTER LOST BY A LANDSLIDE
      

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:22.740

        NO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
        HAS DARED CHALLENGE THE GOAL
      

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.380

        OF INFINITE ECONOMIC GROWTH.


00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:29.620

        Woman:
         'TIS THE GIFT TO BE SIMPLE,
	'TIS THE GIFT TO BE FREE
      

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:34.490

         'TIS THE GIFT TO COME DOWN
        WHERE YOU OUGHT TO BE... 
      

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:37.960

        Simon:
        BILL CLINTON AND AL GORE
	APPRECIATED THE SENTIMENTS
      

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.230

        CONTAINED IN THIS
        OLD SHAKER HYMN.
      

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:42.430

        BUT THEY PLEDGED
        TO "GROW THE ECONOMY"
      

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:44.670

        FASTER THAN
        THEIR OPPONENTS COULD.
      

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.600

        IN BOB DOLE AND
        JACK KEMP'S OPINION
      

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.410

        WE SHOULD AIM AT DOUBLING
        THE AMERICAN ECONOMY
      

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:50.910

        IN THE NEXT 15 YEARS.


00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:53.710

        Simon:
        WHEN JACK KEMP OFFERED
	THAT OPINION
      

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:56.280

        VICE-PRESIDENT GORE
        NEVER QUESTIONED
      

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.080

        WHETHER IT WOULD REALLY BE
        A GOOD IDEA
      

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:05.290

        FOR AMERICANS TO CONSUME
        TWICE AS MUCH AS THEY DO.
      

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:07.590

        I KNOW YOU'LL SAY,
        "THIS WON'T HURT," RIGHT?
      

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:12.800

        WRONG.


00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.600

        OUCH, I'M CALLING MY LAWYER.


00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.270

        SHOTS STING,
        BUT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HELP.
      

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:20.940

        NOW, THERE IS NO SHOT FOR
        AFFLUENZA, BUT HELP IS POSSIBLE
      

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:22.410

        AND IF YOU STAY WITH US


00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:25.470

        WE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT
        AFTER THIS MESSAGE.
      

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:27.840

        Announcer:
        THE AVERAGE NORTH AMERICAN
      

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.710

        CONSUMES FIVE TIMES MORE
        THAN A MEXICAN
      

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:33.320

        TEN TIMES MORE
        THAN A CHINESE PERSON
      

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.450

        AND 30 TIMES MORE
        THAN A PERSON FROM INDIA.
      

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.190

        ( pig belches )


00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:41.890

        WE ARE THE MOST VORACIOUS
        CONSUMERS IN THE WORLD.
      

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:45.330

        Simon:
        IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
	THIS "UN-COMMERIAL" BEFORE
      

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:48.430

        IT'S NOT FOR LACK OF EFFORT
        TO GET IT ON THE AIR.
      

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:51.870

        ALL THE MAJOR NETWORKS
        IN NORTH AMERICA HAVE REJECTED
      

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:54.940

        JUST ABOUT ALL OF OUR
        TELEVISION UN-COMMERCIALS.
      

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:57.310

        Simon:
        THAT HASN'T STOPPED
	THESES ACTIVISTS
      

00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:00.610

        IN VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA,
        FROM PRODUCING THEM.
      

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:04.080

        THEY ORGANIZE AN ANNUAL EVENT
        CALLED "BUY NOTHING DAY"
      

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.150

        AS A PROTEST
        AGAINST CONSUMER CULTURE.
      

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:09.390

        CONSUMERISM AND OVERCONSUMPTION
        IS THE MOTHER
      

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:11.390

        OF ALL OUR
        ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS.
      

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:14.290

        Simon:
        KALLE LASN,
	WHO WAS A MARKET RESEARCHER
      

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:16.190

        UNTIL A SUDDEN CHANGE OF HEART


00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:19.200

        IS THE PUBLISHER OF A MAGAZINE
        CALLED ADBUSTERS.
      

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.070

        IT'S FILLED WITH SLICK PARODIES
        OF REAL ADS.
      

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:23.400

        BUT HIS REAL DREAM IS


00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.640

        TO GET UN-COMMERCIALS
        ON COMMERCIAL TELEVISION.
      

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.840

        Announcer:

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.470

        Lasn:
        I THINK COMMERCIAL TV
      

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:33.480

        IS THE COMMAND CENTER
        OF OUR CONSUMER CULTURE.
      

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.280

        Announcer:
        WHY ARE NINE OUT OF TEN
	WOMEN DISSATISFIED
      

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.310

        WITH SOME ASPECT
        OF THEIR OWN BODIES?
      

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:40.920

        Simon:
        MANY OF THE UN-COMMERCIALS
	ARE DESIGNED
      

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.350

        BY REFUGEES
        FROM THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY
      

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:45.950

        CLANDESTINELY THEY COME
        AND THEY HELP US
      

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:48.160

        TO COME UP WITH
        OUR ENVIRONMENTAL
      

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.930

        AND OTHER KIND OF MESSAGES


00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:52.200

        WHICH ARE TRYING
        TO USE TELEVISION
      

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.460

        TO CHANGE THE WORLD
        FOR THE BETTER
      

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.270

        INVADING THE COMMAND CENTER
        OF CONSUMERISM
      

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:59.740

        WITH SOME VERY POWERFUL
        ANTI-VIRUSES.
      

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.070

        Announcer:
        IT'S COMING...
      

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:04.740

        ( screeching )


00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:08.940

        THE END OF THE AGE
        OF THE AUTOMOBILE.
      

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.850

        Simon:
        TELEVISION EXECUTIVES CONTINUE
	TO REJECT THE ADS
      

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:15.520

        EVEN THOUGH THE PRODUCERS ARE
        WILLING TO PAY FOR THE AIR TIME.
      

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.920

        LASN IS CHALLENGING
        THE REJECTIONS IN COURT.
      

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.190

        BUT EVEN WITHOUT TELEVISION


00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:24.860

        THESE ADBUSTERS FIND WAYS
        TO GET THEIR MESSAGE OUT.
      

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:25.860

        Woman:
        HEY.
      

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:32.770

        LET'S PUT ANOTHER ONE UP HERE.


00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:35.240

        Lasn:
        THIS YEAR,
	"BUY NOTHING DAY" HAS EXPLODED.
      

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.240

        NOT ONLY ARE WE
        IN EIGHT COUNTRIES
      

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.680

        BUT OUR PHONE IS RINGING
        OFF THE HOOK
      

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.210

        AND IT'S BECOMING A TRULY
        INTERNATIONAL CELEBRATION
      

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:46.420

        OF FRUGALITY
        AND LIVING LIGHTLY ON THE PLANET
      

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:48.580

        AND OF VOLUNTARY SIMPLICITY.


00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:51.220

        ( singing to tune
        of "Jingle Bells" )
      

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.360

         OH, GIVE WITH CARE,
        BE AWARE 
      

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.860

         EQUALITY FOR ALL


00:44:54.860 --> 00:45:00.500

         OUR PLANET NEEDS HUMANITY,
        NOT ANOTHER MALL, OH! 
      

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:04.330

        Simon:
        IN SEATTLE, THE "BUY NOTHING
	DAY" CELEBRATION INCLUDED MUSICE
      

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:06.530

        BY A GROUP CALLED
        "THE RAGING GRANNIES"
      

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:09.700

        AND SIGNS URGING PASSERSBY
        TO CUT UP THEIR CREDIT CARDS.
      

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:11.210

        SEVERAL DID.


00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:12.610

        Woman:
        WHOO! ALL RIGHT!
      

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:15.110

        LOOK AT THAT CARD
        GETTING CUT UP.
      

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:16.410

        IT FEELS SO GOOD!


00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:18.910

        HERE YOU GO.


00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:21.420

        Simon:
        THOUGH MOST SHOPPERS
	IGNORED THE PROTEST
      

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.550

        SOME FOUND IT THOUGHT-PROVOKING.


00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:25.220

        Teen:
        THIS COUNTRY'S LUXURIOUS.
      

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:26.660

        YOU DON'T
        REALLY NEED
      

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:27.760

        WE JUST
        BUY STUFF
      

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.390

        BECAUSE WE'RE IN A
        COMMERCIAL SOCIETY.
      

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:31.990

        I'LL PASS
        SOME OF THESE OUT.
      

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:34.200

        Lasn:
        I FEEL THAT WE ARE
	AT THE EARLY STAGES
      

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.070

        OF A SECOND AMERICAN REVOLUTION


00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:39.300

        TO RECONSIDER THIS CONSUMPTION
        BINGE THAT WE'VE BEEN ON
      

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.200

        FOR ALMOST HALF A CENTURY NOW.


00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.610

        IT'S GOING TO KEEP ON
        GATHERING MOMENTUM
      

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:45.440

        AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE


00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.910

        EVEN THE ECONOMISTS
        WILL COME ON BOARD.
      

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:51.650

        Man:
        CONSUMPTION REALLY IS AT THE
	HEART OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT.
      

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:54.350

        Simon:
        TO IMPROVE OUR QUALITY OF LIFE
      

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:57.490

        ECONOMISTS COULD CHANGE
        THE WAY THEY MEASURE PROGRESS.
      

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:59.550

        CRITICS SAY
        THE CURRENT YARDSTICK--
      

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:03.030

        GROWTH OF THE GROSS DOMESTIC
        PRODUCT, OR G.D.P.--
      

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:05.590

        IS SEVERELY FLAWED.


00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:08.400

        AS THE ECONOMY THAT AMERICANS
        EXPERIENCES GETS WORSE
      

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.530

        THE G.D.P. OFTEN PORTRAYS IT
        AS BETTER.
      

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:12.800

        Simon:
        TAKE A FAMILY GOING
	THROUGH DIVORCE.
      

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.370

        Halstead:
        FIRST THEY HAVE
	COSTLY LEGAL BILLS
      

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:17.170

        THEN THEY ESTABLISH
        TWO HOUSEHOLDS
      

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:19.140

        INSTEAD OF ONE HOUSEHOLD.


00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.340

        BUYING AND SPENDING
        GOES UP CONSIDERABLY
      

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:24.480

        BUT MEANWHILE, WHAT YOU HAVE
        IS FAMILY BREAKDOWN.
      

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.620

        Simon:
        THE MORE WE PAY THE COSTS
	OF AFFLUENZA
      

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:30.150

        THE HEALTHIER
        THE G.D.P. SAYS WE ARE.
      

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:34.460

        Announcer:
        EVERY TIME A FOREST FALLS,
	THE G.N.P. GOES UP.
      

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:38.660

        WITH EVERY OIL SPILL,
        THE G.N.P. GOES UP.
      

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:41.830

        EVERY TIME A NEW CANCER
        PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED
      

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:43.370

        THE G.N.P. GOES UP.


00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:46.070

        Simon:
        TED HALSTEAD AND HIS COLLEAGUES
	HAVE DEVELOPED
      

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:48.700

        A DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT
        OF ECONOMIC SUCCESS--
      

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:52.910

        THE G.P.I.,
        OR GENUINE PROGRESS INDICATOR.
      

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:56.040

        THE G.P.I. TAKES INTO ACCOUNT
        24 ASPECTS OF OUR ECONOMIC LIVES
      

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.280

        THAT THE G.D.P. IGNORES.


00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.950

        THEY START WITH, FOR EXAMPLE


00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:01.280

        THE VALUE OF HOUSEWORK
        AND VOLUNTEERISM.
      

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.550

        WE ADD FOR THAT.


00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:04.890

        WE SUBTRACT THINGS
        LIKE THE COST OF CRIME
      

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:08.620

        THE COST OF CAR ACCIDENTS,
        THE COST OF FAMILY BREAKDOWN.
      

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:11.090

        Simon:
        WHILE G.D.P. CONTINUES TO RISE
      

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:13.930

        THE G.P.I. HAS BEEN FALLING
        SINCE 1973.
      

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:16.470

        Halstead:
        MEANING THAT BY THIS MEASURE
      

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.630

        THE OVERALL COSTS
        OF INCREASED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
      

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:21.070

        ARE STARTING
        TO OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS.
      

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:22.640

        THERE'S NOW A GNAWING SENSE


00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:26.410

        THAT WE'RE PASSING ON A WORLD
        OF SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL
      

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:28.880

        AND ECONOMIC DEBT
        TO OUR CHILDREN.
      

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.310

        Simon:
        JOE DOMINGUEZ WOULD AGREE
      

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:33.650

        AND FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS,
        THIS FORMER STOCK MARKET ANALYST
      

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:35.520

        HAS BEEN DOING SOMETHING
        ABOUT IT.
      

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.720

        Dominguez:
        WHEN I WAS ON WALL STREET
      

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.920

        I SAW THAT PEOPLE
        THAT HAD MORE MONEY
      

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.920

        WERE NOT NECESSARILY
        ANY HAPPIER.
      

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:45.230

        THEY HAD JUST AS MANY PROBLEMS
        AS THE FOLKS THAT LIVED
      

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:47.800

        IN MY GHETTO NEIGHBORHOOD
        WHERE I GREW UP.
      

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.570

        SO IT BEGAN TO DAWN ON ME THAT
        MONEY DIDN'T BUY HAPPINESS--
      

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:53.300

        A VERY SIMPLE FINDING.


00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.000

        Simon:
        SO JOE TRIED FRUGALITY.
      

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.440

        HE FOUND HE ENJOYED LIFE MORE,
        AND HE SAVED SO MUCH
      

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:01.440

        HE WAS ABLE TO RETIRE EARLY
        AND LIVE ON HIS INTEREST.
      

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.280

        THEN HE TAUGHT OTHER PEOPLE
        HOW TO CUT THEIR SPENDING.
      

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.950

        VICKI ROBIN WAS ONE OF THEM.


00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:09.890

        Robin:
        I FOUND THAT I NEEDED
	TO LEARN HOW TO FIX THINGS
      

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:12.450

        AND I BECAME FASCINATED
        WITH LIVING LIFE DIRECTLY
      

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:15.690

        AND DEVELOPING MY SKILLS
        AND CAPACITIES AND INGENUITY
      

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:18.360

        RATHER THAN JUST EARNING
        MORE AND MORE MONEY
      

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.300

        AND THROWING MONEY AT PROBLEMS.


00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.000

        Robin:
        WE HAVE SO CONFUSED
      

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.600

        STANDARD OF LIVING
        WITH QUALITY OF LIFE...
      

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.700

        Simon:
        SOON VICKI, TOO,
	WAS TEACHING WORKSHOPS
      

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.470

        ABOUT USING MONEY WISELY.


00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:33.580

        IN TIME, THE WORKSHOPS LED TO
        A POPULAR AUDIOCASSETTE COURSE
      

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.180

        A CHARITABLE FOUNDATION


00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:39.350

        AND A BEST-SELLING BOOK CALLED
        YOUR MONEY OR YOUR LIFE.
      

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:40.880

        IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING A KILLING


00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.190

        IT'S NOT ABOUT
        HOW TO BUY REAL ESTATE
      

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:45.890

        WITH NO MONEY DOWN
        OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT.
      

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:48.890

        IT'S SIMPLY HOW TO HANDLE
        YOUR EXISTING PAYCHECK
      

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:50.790

        IN A MUCH MORE INTELLIGENT WAY


00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:53.700

        THAN THE WAY
        THAT YOU'VE BEEN HANDLING IT.
      

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.670

        Simon:
        THAT MEANS CAREFULLY
	REEXAMINING SPENDING HABITS
      

00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:57.900

        AND ASKING IF WHAT YOU BUY


00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:01.770

        IS REALLY WORTH THE EXTRA
        WORKING HOURS IT WILL COST YOU.
      

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:03.970

        IT'S THE STUFF
        THAT OUR GRANDPARENTS KNEW.
      

00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:05.740

        YOU KNOW, HER GRANDMA
        READ THE BOOK
      

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:08.110

        BEFORE IT CAME OUT,
        AND AFTER SHE READ IT
      

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:10.410

        THE NEXT DAY
        SHE CAME IN TO US AND SAID
      

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:12.150

        "YOU'RE GOING
        TO PUBLISH THIS?
      

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:13.380

        "EVERYONE KNOWS THIS.


00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:15.250

        YOU'RE CRAZY."


00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:18.420

        Dominguez:
        "AFTER ONLY THREE MONTHS,
	WE ARE OUT OF DEBT.
      

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:21.620

        WE HAVE BECOME MORE AT PEACE
        WITH MONEY IN OUR LIFE."
      

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:23.230

        THIS WAS IN PORTLAND.


00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:26.930

        Simon:
        THOUSANDS OF READERS HAVE FOUND
	THE BOOK TO BE A REVELATION
      

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.100

        THEY FOLLOW
        ITS NINE-STEP PROGRAM
      

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:32.030

        AND FIND THEMSELVES
        LOWERING THEIR EXPENSES
      

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:33.840

        BY AN AVERAGE OF 25%.


00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.470

        Robin:
        THE CORRESPONDENCE
	THAT WE'VE GOTTEN INDICATES
      

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:40.210

        THAT PEOPLE FROM EVERY INCOME
        BRACKET ARE USING THIS PROGRAM.
      

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:42.410

        OBVIOUSLY THE STEPS
        WILL BE FAR MORE FRUITFUL
      

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:43.650

        AND FAR MORE EFFECTIVE


00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:45.810

        FOR PEOPLE
        IN THE LOWER-INCOME BRACKETS
      

00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:47.650

        SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES


00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:49.920

        WHO NEED TO KNOW
        HOW TO STRETCH A BUCK.
      

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.150

        Oprah Winfrey:
        Oh, good, good point, Vicki
      

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:53.860

        good point, got that.


00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:57.830

        JOE DOMINGUEZ AND VICKI ROBIN
	EACH LIVE COMFORTABLY
      

00:49:57.830 --> 00:49:59.730

        ON $7,000 A YEAR


00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:02.400

        WHILE DONATING ALL ROYALTIES
        TO THEIR FOUNDATION.
      

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.300

        OTHER AMERICANS ARE FINDING
        THEIR OWN WAYS
      

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.400

        TO LIVE BETTER WITH LESS.


00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.640

        ONE SOLUTION IS CO-HOUSING.


00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:12.810

        IN PORTLAND, OREGON, SEVERAL
        FAMILIES HAVE COME TOGETHER
      

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:15.180

        TO FORM THE ONGOING
        CO-HOUSING COMMUNITY.
      

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:18.580

        EACH FAMILY HAS ITS OWN HOME,
        BUT THEY GROW FOOD TOGETHER
      

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:23.650

        TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER'S
        CHILDREN, AND OFTEN SHARE MEALS.
      

00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:25.090

        THEY BUY GROCERIES IN BULK


00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:29.660

        AND LOWER THEIR EXPENSES
        IN VARIOUS WAYS.
      

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:30.730

        A RECENT STUDY FOUND


00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:33.530

        THAT CO-HOUSING FAMILIES
        USE HALF THE ENERGY
      

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:37.430

        AND PRODUCE ONLY HALF AS MUCH
        WASTE AS TYPICAL HOUSEHOLDS.
      

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:40.200

        THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS
        HAVE VOLUNTARILY DECIDED
      

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.400

        TO LIVE WITH FEWER POSSESSIONS.


00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:46.470

        ACCORDING TO A 1995 POLL,
        86% OF THOSE AMERICANS
      

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:49.310

        WHO HAVE VOLUNTARILY
        CUT BACK THEIR CONSUMPTION
      

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:52.650

        SAY THEY ARE HAPPIER
        AS A RESULT.
      

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:55.280

        INTEREST IN VOLUNTARY SIMPLICITY


00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:58.890

        NOW EXTENDS
        EVEN TO THE CORPORATE WORLD.
      

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:01.820

        MY NAME IS LITA AND MY LIFE
        IS SIMPLY TOO COMPLICATED.
      

00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:03.430

        MY LIFE HAS BECOME SO CHAOTIC


00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:06.190

        I HAVE TROUBLE SORTING THINGS
        OUT ON A DAILY BASIS
      

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:08.330

        AND I REALLY THOUGHT
        THIS MIGHT HELP.
      

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:11.700

        Man:
        IF YOU TAKE
	THE SIMPLICITY COURSE
      

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:12.800

        AND YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY


00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.070

        THEN YOU'LL HAVE
        MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME
      

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:17.410

        TO DO ANYTHING
        THAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU.
      

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:21.010

        Simon:
        WHEN DICK ROY OF THE NORTHWEST
	EARTH INSTITUTE RAN A WORKSHOP
      

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:24.180

        ON VOLUNTARY SIMPLICITY
        AT NIKE'S PORTLAND HEADQUARTERS
      

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:27.480

        A HUNDRED PEOPLE GAVE UP
        THEIR LUNCH HOUR TO ATTEND.
      

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.780

        NEARLY ALL JOINED
        LONG-TERM STUDY GROUPS
      

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.750

        HOPING TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES.


00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:36.730

        Man:
        STUDY CIRCLES ARE BEGINNING TO
	DEVELOP, NEWSLETTERS, MAGAZINES
      

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:40.160

        INTERNET RESOURCES
        ON THE COMPUTER AND SO ON
      

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:44.870

        AND THAT IS NOW BEGINNING TO
        CREATE A CULTURE OF SIMPLICITY
      

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:47.670

        A CULTURE OF ECOLOGICAL LIVING.


00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:50.270

        Simon:
        IF TREND-WATCHER GERALD CELENTE
	IS RIGHT
      

00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:52.570

        IT'S A CULTURE
        WITH GROWING APPEAL.
      

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:56.480

        Celente:
        IN OUR 17 YEARS
	OF TREND TRACKING
      

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.980

        NEVER BEFORE
        HAVE WE SEEN AN ISSUE
      

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:02.150

        THAT IS GAINING
        SUCH GLOBAL ACCEPTANCE
      

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:04.250

        AS VOLUNTARY SIMPLICITY.


00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:07.760

        IN 1996, WE ESTIMATE


00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:11.230

        ABOUT FIVE PERCENT
        OF THE BABY-BOOM POPULATION
      

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:16.430

        ARE PRACTICING A VERY STRONG
        FORM OF VOLUNTARY SIMPLICITY.
      

00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:18.100

        BY THE YEAR 2000, WE ESTIMATE


00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:21.040

        THAT NUMBER IS GOING
        TO BE UP TO 15%.
      

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.800

        THEY'RE FINDING
        A CURE FOR AFFLUENZA.
      

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.210

        THEY GET RID OF THEIR STRESS
        AND THEY SAY
      

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:27.780

        "YOU KNOW, I LIKE LIVING
        LIKE THIS A LOT BETTER.
      

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:29.650

        HOW DID I LIVE
        LIKE THAT BEFORE?"
      

00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:31.110

        ( group singing )


00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:33.010

        Simon:
        AND IT'S NOT JUST BOOMERS.
      

00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:35.180

        CELENTE SEES GROWING EVIDENCE


00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.390

        THAT YOUNG AMERICANS
        ARE ALSO BEGINNING
      

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:39.320

        TO REBEL AGAINST CONSUMERISM.


00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.220

        Celente:
        TODAY'S TEENS AND PRE-TEENS
      

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.690

        ARE GOING TO BE
        TOMORROW'S REVOLUTIONARIES.
      

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:47.100

        THEY'RE GOING TO BE
        VERY ANTIMATERIALISTIC.
      

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.070

        Simon:
        THESE YOUNG ACTIVISTS
	HOPE HE'S RIGHT.
      

00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:53.070

        "...YOU'RE STUPID, YOU'RE UGLY,
        YOU'RE NOT POPULAR
      

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:55.270

        UNLESS YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT"


00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:56.870

        AND IT SICKENS ME.


00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:59.670

        Simon:
        WHEN YOUTH FOR ENVIRONMENTAL
      

00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:01.540

        FROM AROUND THE WORLD
        MET RECENTLY
      

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:03.980

        THEY TALKED ABOUT LIVING SIMPLY


00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:06.580

        AND ASSURING A FUTURE
        FOR ALL GENERATIONS TO COME.
      

00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:08.650

        IT NEED NOT BE
        A FUTURE OF DEPRIVATION.
      

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:11.320

        STUDIES SUGGEST
        THAT THE EARTH COULD SUSTAIN
      

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:14.560

        A STANDARD OF LIVING
        NEARLY AS COMFORTABLE AS OUR OWN
      

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.420

        FOR EVERY HUMAN BEING ON EARTH


00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:19.860

        BUT THAT WOULD DEMAND SOCIAL
        AS WELL AS PERSONAL CHANGE.
      

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:21.330

        IT WOULD MEAN INVESTING


00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:24.770

        IN NONPOLLUTING,
        ENERGY-EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES
      

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:29.140

        PRODUCING GOODS THAT LAST LONGER
        AND REQUIRE FEWER RESOURCES
      

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:30.940

        CAREFULLY REUSING AND RECYCLING


00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:34.210

        REWARDING FRUGALITY
        WHILE PENALIZING WASTE.
      

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:38.010

        NARROWING THE GAP
        BETWEEN RICH AND POOR
      

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:40.650

        COMMITTING OURSELVES
        TO ECONOMIC STABILITY
      

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:44.450

        INSTEAD OF INFINITE EXPANSION.


00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:48.390

        YOUR MOUTH FEELS CLEAN,
        YOUR THROAT REFRESHED
      

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:52.400

        AS COOL AND AS CLEAN
        AS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR.
      

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.030

        Simon:
        A GENERATION AGO
      

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:57.400

        AMERICANS WATCHED ADS LIKE THIS
        AND NOBODY LAUGHED.
      

00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.640

        ATTITUDES ABOUT SMOKING
        HAVE CERTAINLY CHANGED.
      

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.240

        TODAY, WITH GROWING EVIDENCE


00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.640

        THAT OVERCONSUMPTION
        MAY ALSO BE HAZARDOUS
      

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:08.280

        IT'S TIME, PERHAPS,
        FOR ANOTHER ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT.
      

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.910

        AND WHAT MIGHT WE GAIN?


00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:12.610

        STRONGER FAMILIES
        AND COMMUNITIES
      

00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:15.550

        SHORTER WORKING HOURS
        AND LESS STRESS
      

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:17.720

        A BETTER WAY OF LIFE.


00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:18.950

        THINK ABOUT IT.


00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:23.030

        THINK ABOUT ALL THE MONEY WE
        SPEND TO FIGHT VARIOUS DISEASES
      

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:26.660

        AND THEN REMEMBER AFFLUENZA
        IS ONE MALADY WE CAN CURE
      

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:28.900

        BY SPENDING LESS MONEY,
        NOT MORE.
      

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:30.570

        THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.


00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:35.570

        I'M SCOTT SIMON.
