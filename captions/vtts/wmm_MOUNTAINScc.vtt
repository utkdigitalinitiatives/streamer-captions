LABOR STRUGGLES THERE.

COMMUNIST BACK THEN EVEN?

WITH A LOT OF THE BLACK
COMMUNISTS WHO HAD COME TO

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.711

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:59.719

ALL OF THOSE STRUGGLES.

WERE A MEMBER OF AN ORGANIZATION

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:12.732
LIKE THE NAACP, IT WAS ASSUMED
THAT YOU WERE A COMMUNIST.

U.S. GOVERNMENT

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:29.749
MADE COMMUNISM ALMOST
SOMETHING CRIMINAL.

THE CONNECTION BETWEEN

"WELL HE'S SLEEPING.

MID-AMERICA AND GET A JOB,

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:45.684
IF THEY WOULD BE HIRED.

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:48.187
SO, WHERE DID YOU
GO WHEN YOU LEFT THE CAMPS?

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:52.191
WAIT, IN CAMP I MET
A GUY, [LAUGHS] WHO I FELL

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:53.192
-IN LOVE WITH.
-YES.

00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:55.694
I WANTED TO GET MARRIED
TO HIM VERY MUCH AND

00:19:55.694 --> 00:20:00.699
I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS
SET, AND JUST BEFORE THE 442

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.203
LEFT FOR OVERSEAS,
YOU KNOW, FOR EUROPE.

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:08.707
MY MOTHER GOT A PERMIT TO
BE AT THE WEDDING AND STUFF,

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:12.711
AND THEN, JUST AS WE
WERE GETTING MARRIED,

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:19.218
THE CHAPLAIN SAYS,
"I JUST RECEIVED A TELEGRAM."

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:23.222
AND HE SAID "I'M SORRY,
BUT BILL'S FATHER SAID

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:26.725
'I CAN NEVER PERMIT THIS, I
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO SHE IS.'"

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:31.230
AND I WAS JUST SO
SHOCKED AND HURT.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.232
AND THEN THE CHAPLAIN SAID,

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:38.737
"LOOK, ALL THE WOMEN, THE WIVES
WHO ARE HERE WITH THEIR

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:43.742
HUSBANDS, THEY'RE ALL GOING BACK
TO CAMP OR WHERE EVER THEY'RE

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:49.248
GOING TO GO." BUT HE SAID, "WE
DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO RUN THE

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.250
USO, THE JAPANESE-AMERICAN USO."

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.754
SO,I STAYED THERE
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.

00:20:55.754 --> 00:21:00.759
AFTER ALL THE GUYS LEFT
AND ALL THEIR WIVES WENT

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:03.762
BACK TO CAMP, I DIDN'T
WANT TO GO BACK TO CAMP.

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:06.765
I GOT A JOB,
I THINK IN MINNESOTA.

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:10.269
SO, WERE YOU WITH YOUR
HUSBAND BILL THEN OR WAS HE...

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:11.270
WELL, HE WENT OVERSEAS.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.271
HE WAS STILL OVERSEAS?

00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:13.772
YEAH.

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:15.274
SO YOU WENT BY YOURSELF TO
MINNESOTA?

00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:17.276
RIGHT, YEAH.

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:20.779
AND THEN WHEN THE WAR
FINALLY WAS OVER, WELL, I

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:24.283
WAS BACK IN
MY HOMETOWN WITH MY MOTHER

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:26.785
AND MY OLDER BROTHER
WHO DIDN'T GET IN THE ARMY.

00:21:26.785 --> 00:21:28.287
Angela: WAIT,THEY HAVE MOVED
BACK TO SAN PEDRO

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:32.791
YES, AND IT WAS SO STRANGE
GOING BACK, PEOPLE WERE ASKING,

00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:35.294
"WHERE DID YOU GO?"

00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:36.295
I MEAN, SO THEY

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:39.798
SO THEY WERE TOTALLY
UNAWARE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING?

00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:40.799
UNAWARE.

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:42.801
YEAH,"SO WHAT DID YOU
DO DURING THE WAR?"

00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:46.305
AND I SAID, "NO JAPANESE-
AMERICAN COULD LIVE HERE."

00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:50.309
AND I GUESS THEY DIDN'T KNOW.

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:52.311
YOU KNOW, WE'RE TAUGHT
ABOUT, WHAT IS IT?

00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:56.815
FREEDOM, JUSTICE AND WHAT?

00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:59.318
FREEDOM, JUSTICE AND WHAT,
EQUALITY OR SOMETHING?

00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:01.820
EQUALITY, DEMOCRACY
AND ALL OF THAT.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.822
[LAUGHTER] YEAH, AND I
ALWAYS BELIEVED IT.

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:09.828
AND WHAT A GREAT COUNTRY THIS
WAS AND THEN I STARTED THINKING,

00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:10.829
WAIT A MINUTE.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:17.836
WELL I STARTED TO SEE AMERICA
QUITE, QUITE DIFFERENTLY.

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:22.841
MY MOTHER AND FATHER
BOUGHT THEIR FIRST HOUSE,

00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:24.343
IT WAS THEIR ONLY HOUSE.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:27.846
[LAUGHS] WE STILL
OWN THE HOUSE NOW.

00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:31.350
AND IT WAS IN A
NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WAS

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:36.855
RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF A
NEIGHBORHOOD ZONED

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:39.358
-FOR WHITE PEOPLE ONLY.
-UH-HUH.

00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:42.361
SO WHERE WE LIVED, BLACK
PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED TO

00:22:42.361 --> 00:22:45.864
LIVE ON ONE SIDE OF THE
STREET, BUT WE WERE NOT

00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:49.868
ALLOWED TO LIVE OR EVEN WALK ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET.

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:51.370
Yuri: OH MY GOODNESS.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:55.374
SO, YOU KNOW, GROWING UP
UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES

00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:59.878
MADE US REALLY AWARE OF, YOU
KNOW,THE MEANING OF SEGREGATION.

00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:05.884
MY EARLIEST INVOLVEMENT
WAS WHEN I WAS 11 YEARS OLD

00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:07.386
AND I BECAME

00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:09.388
-OH 11.
-YEAH.

00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:10.889
[LAUGHTER] AND WHAT WAS
THE ISSUE?

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:14.893
IT WAS, WE FORMED AN
INTERRACIAL DISCUSSION GROUP

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:18.897
-FOR YOUNG, YOU KNOW,FOR KIDS.
-INTERRACIAL?

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:20.399
A CHILDREN'S INTERRACIAL
DISCUSSION GROUP.

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:21.400
IN THE SOUTH?

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.901
YES, YES.

00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:29.908
AND WE MET AT MY MOTHER'S CHURCH
OUR CHURCH,THE SAME CHURCH WHERE

00:23:29.908 --> 00:23:34.913
WE ARE HAVING HER MEMORIAL. AND
AS A RESULT OF OUR MEETINGS,

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:37.916
THEY BURNED THE CHURCH. THEY
BURNED A PORTION OF THE CHURCH.

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:39.418
OH MY GOD!

00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:44.423
YEAH, SO I GUESS YOU MIGHT
SAY IT WAS BAPTISM BY FIRE.

00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:45.924
[LAUGHS] WOW, JEEZ!

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:46.925
YEAH.

00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:48.427
WAIT, WHAT PART OF ALABAMA?

00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:49.428
BIRMINGHAM.

00:23:49.428 --> 00:23:51.430
OH, "BOMBINGHAM" RIGHT.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.432
[LAUGHTER] I KNOW IN MY
AUTO-BIOGRAPHY I DESCRIBED

00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:58.437
THE FACT THAT SOME OF MY
EARLIEST MEMORIES ARE THE

00:23:58.437 --> 00:23:59.938
SOUNDS OF BOMBS GOING OFF.

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:02.941
BECAUSE WHENEVER BLACK
PEOPLE WOULD TRY TO BUY

00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:07.446
ONE OF THE HOUSES ACROSS
THE STREET, THE KU KLUX KLAN

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:13.952
WOULD COME AND EITHER BURN
THE HOUSE OR BOMB THE HOUSE.

00:24:13.952 --> 00:24:17.456
AND THEN AT THAT TIME,
THE CITY GOVERNMENT WAS RUN

00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:18.457
-BY BULL CONNOR.
-OH.

00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:19.958
AND YOU REMEMBER
BULL CONNOR, RIGHT?

00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:21.460
YEAH.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.461
SO, BULL CONNOR WOULD GET
IN ON THE RADIO AND WOULD

00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:25.464
SAY SOMETHING LIKE HE
WOULD USE YOU KNOW, THE

00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:30.969
OTHER WORD, "MOVED IN ON
CENTER STREET AND THERE WILL BE

00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:33.972
BLOODSHED TONIGHT,"
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:34.973
WOW.

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:36.475
AND SURE ENOUGH,
THE BOMB WOULD GO OFF AND

00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:37.976
OH MY GOSH!

00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:39.478
YEAH, YEAH.

00:24:39.478 --> 00:24:43.482
SO I THINK THAT GROWING UP
UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS AND

00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:47.486
HAVING MY MOTHER AND
FATHER EXPLAIN TO US WHAT

00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:52.991
WAS GOING ON, BUT ALSO
HAVING THEM EMPHASIZE TO

00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:55.494
US OVER AND OVER AGAIN
THAT THIS WAS NOT THE WAY

00:24:55.994 --> 00:24:57.996
THINGS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE.

00:24:57.996 --> 00:24:58.997
UMM HMM.

00:24:58.997 --> 00:24:59.998
THAT THEY COULD CHANGE.

00:24:59.998 --> 00:25:02.000
THAT WASN'T THE
CHURCH THAT THE FOUR...

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.502
Angela: NO. NO?

00:25:04.002 --> 00:25:07.005
THE CHURCH I'M REFERRING TO IS
THE FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH

00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:08.507
AND THE FOUR GIRLS WERE KILLED

00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:10.509
AT THE 60TH
STREET BAPTIST CHURCH.

00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:12.511
Yuri: OH, YEAH BAPTIST CHURCH.

00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:15.013
WHICH RIGHT NOW IS RIGHT
ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE

00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:18.016
BIRMINGHAM CIVIL
RIGHTS INSTITUTE

00:25:18.016 --> 00:25:20.018
[GOSPEL MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:22.020
AMAZING GRACE,
HOW SWEET IT DOES SOUND .

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:28.026
THAT SAVED A SOUL LIKE ME.

00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:32.531
Yuri: BUT, I ALSO REMEMBER THE
MONTGOMERY, YOU KNOW, BUS

00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:34.032
Angela: YES, THAT'S RIGHT, THE
MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT WHICH IS

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:36.034
Yuri: SO YOU WERE
THERE TOO, I GUESS.

00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:40.539
Angela: YEAH, I WAS, IN 1955
I WAS STILL IN BIRMINGHAM.

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:43.041
I LEFT IN 1959.

00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:45.043
Yuri: OH.

00:25:45.043 --> 00:25:47.045
Angela: TO GO TO HIGH SCHOOL
IN NEW YORK.

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:50.048
WHAT HIGH SCHOOL?
I NEVER KNEW THAT.

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:54.052
YEAH, THIS WAS A SCHOOL, IS A
SCHOOL IN GREENWICH VILLAGE.

00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:56.054
[JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING]
[MAN SPEAKING]

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:58.056
"YOU SHOULD LEARN EVERYTHING YOU
CAN IN SCHOOL AND THEN COME OUT

00:25:58.056 --> 00:25:59.558
OUT AND USE IT AGAINST THEM."

00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:05.564
I WENT ON AN EXCHANGE PROGRAM
THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY

00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:08.567
THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE
COMMITTEE, THE QUAKERS.

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:10.068
OH.

00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:16.074
I LIVED WITH A FAMILY IN
BROOKLYN, IN BEDFORD-STUYVESANT.

00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:22.581
AND THE MAN WAS A MINISTER,
REV. WILLIAM HOWARD MELISH.

00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:24.583
-HE IS...
-IS HE BLACK OR WHITE?

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:27.085
HE WAS WHITE.

00:26:27.085 --> 00:26:31.089
HE AND HIS FATHER WERE
MINISTERS AT THE LARGEST

00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:35.093
EPISCOPALIAN CHURCH IN THE AREA,
IT WAS IN BROOKLYN HEIGHTS.

00:26:35.594 --> 00:26:36.595
Yuri: UMM HMM.

00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:41.099
AND BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTIVE IN
THE SOVIET-AMERICAN FRIENDSHIP

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:43.602
-SOCIETY,
-OH. UH-HUH.

00:26:43.602 --> 00:26:46.605
THE DIOCESE TOOK THE
CHURCH FROM THEM, BECAUSE

00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:51.109
WHEN I ARRIVED IN 1959 THE
CHURCH HAD BEEN COMPLETELY

00:26:51.109 --> 00:26:57.115
SHUT DOWN AND THEY WERE
DOING SERVICES IN OTHER PLACES.

00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:59.117
OH.

00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:00.619
SO THEY WERE THE TARGET OF
QUITE A BIT OF ANTI-COMMUNISM.

00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:07.125
I LIVED WITH THAT FAMILY AND
WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL IN THE

00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:08.627
-VILLAGE.
-ELISABETH IRWIN.

00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:09.628
IT'S INTERESTING,
ISN'T IT, THAT WE BOTH

00:27:10.128 --> 00:27:12.130
HAVE ALL OF THESE
CONNECTIONS WITH NEW YORK?

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.632
OF COURSE, YOU HAVE SPENT
MANY MORE YEARS IN NEW

00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:18.136
YORK THAN I DID, BUT I WAS
THERE DOING SOME OF THE

00:27:18.136 --> 00:27:23.141
YEARS YOU SPOKE ABOUT IN
THE LATE 50'S EARLY 60'S.

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:26.144
AND I WAS ALSO THERE IN 1970.

00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:27.646
IN AUGUST OF 1970, WHEN I
WAS ARRESTED IN NEW YORK.

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:34.653
AND I WAS TAKEN TO THE
WOMEN'S HOUSE OF DETENTION

00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:38.657
WHICH AT THAT TIME
WAS LOCATED IN THE HEART OF

00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:40.659
-GREENWICH VILLAGE.
-OH REALLY? UH HUH.

00:27:40.659 --> 00:27:45.163
SO YOU HAD ASKED ME WHO
ELSE WAS ARRESTED IN THAT

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:46.665
AND TAKEN TO THAT JAIL.

00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:49.668
I KNOW WHEN THE NEW YORK
21, YOU REMEMBER THE CASE

00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:52.170
OF THE NEW YORK 21 AND
AFENI SHAKUR?

00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:54.172
Yuri: AFENI SHAKUR.

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:56.675
AFENI WAS IN THAT JAIL,
NOT WHEN I WAS THERE, BUT

00:27:56.675 --> 00:27:59.177
I KNEW THAT SHE HAD BEEN THERE.

00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:01.179
Yuri: OH.

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:02.681
AND THAT'S WHERE
BILLIE HOLIDAY WAS TAKEN

00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:04.182
Yuri: REALLY?

00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:07.686
WHEN SHE WAS ARRESTED.
BEFORE THEY TOOK HER TO ALDERSON

00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:12.190
[GASPS] 'CAUSE BILLIE
HOLIDAY WAS IN ALDERSON AT

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.192
THE SAME TIME THAT
LOLITA LEBRON WAS IN ALDERSON.

00:28:14.192 --> 00:28:15.193
Yuri: REALLY?

00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:18.196
AND PERHAPS WHEN YOU WERE
WRITING TO LOLITA LEBRON

ABOUT RAM RIGHT.

AND THE MORE I LEARNED
ABOUT BLACK'S HISTORY AND

00:37:56.774 --> 00:38:02.280
THEN ON MY OWN, READING
ABOUT SLAVERY WHICH IS

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.283
CERTAINLY THE MOST
INHUMANE THING THAT

HAPPENED!

YES! OH INTERESTING.

[LAUGHS] I MEAN HAROLD
CRUSE!

00:38:14.792 --> 00:38:17.295

WHAT WAS IT?

00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:19.297
"THE CRISIS OF THE NEGRO
INTELLECTUAL." RIGHT!

THAT'S TRUE, THAT TRUE.

00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:30.808
SO WHERE WAS HE TEACHING
WHEN YOU TOOK THE COURSE?

YES.

IT BECAME LIKE THE BIGGEST
THING IN HARLEM AND THE

YOU TO HAVE THIS.

HE WENT TO SPEAK.

YOU WERE THERE. - YEAH.

AN ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT

MAYBE ABOUT FIVE OR SIX.

00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:17.915
DID HE MENTION ANYTHING
ABOUT "I DIDN'T SEE MANY BLACKS.

YEAH, WELL. YEAH, HE DID.
- YEAH.

00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:24.422
HE DID ACKNOWLEDGE ME AS A

IMPORTANT AT THAT TIME

THERE WEREN'T A GREAT DEAL

ALONE.

COULD SHAKE HANDS WITH

WAS AS WARM TO WHITES AS

00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:07.645

I KEPT WRITING TO HIM.

OVER, HE SAID,

WILL WRITE TO YOU."

FELT THAT MAO DID THE

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:15.713
RIGHT THING IN -- WELL HE
SHOWED SORT OF FAVORITISM

BECAUSE THEY WERE FEEDING

00:47:16.834 --> 00:47:18.335
SO I MEAN HE WAS -- SO
THIS WAS THE PERIOD WHEN

00:47:18.335 --> 00:47:22.840
HE WAS THINKING VERY
CRITICALLY ABOUT THE

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.343
NATIONALIST PHILOSOPHY HE
HAD ESPOUSED, HE WAS SORT

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:27.845
OF -- YES.

00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:30.347
-- REVISING HIS WHOLE
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY.

00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:32.850
RIGHT, YOU KNOW HE CHANGED
-- YOU KNOW FROM BLACK

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:34.852
NATIONALISM -- YES.

00:47:34.852 --> 00:47:39.356
-- TO PAN-AFRICANISM, TO
REVOLUTIONARY

00:47:39.356 --> 00:47:40.858
[BOTH AT THE SAME TIME]
INTERNATIONALISM.

00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:41.859
YEAH.

00:47:41.859 --> 00:47:45.863
WELL DO YOU THINK PEOPLE
TODAY ARE AWARE OF

00:47:45.863 --> 00:47:50.868
MALCOLM'S RELATIONSHIP TO
ASIAN INTERNATIONAL ISSUES

00:47:50.868 --> 00:47:53.871
AS WELL AS -- NO, I DON'T
THINK SO.

00:47:53.871 --> 00:47:55.873
AND EVEN THAT OF HIM
MEETING WITH THE

00:47:55.873 --> 00:47:58.375
HIBAKUSHAS IS VERY LITTLE
KNOWN.

00:47:58.375 --> 00:47:59.376
IS IT IN THE
AUTOBIOGRAPHY?

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:00.878
WHAT?

00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:02.379
IS IT IN -- NO IT'S NOT.

00:48:02.379 --> 00:48:03.380
IT'S NOT IN THE
AUTOBIOGRAPHY.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.382
BUT YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO
MANY THINGS NOT IN HIS

00:48:05.382 --> 00:48:06.383
AUTOBIOGRAPHY!

00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:09.386
[EXHALES] AND THEN, YOU
KNOW, THERE WERE THREE

00:48:09.386 --> 00:48:11.388
CHAPTERS THAT ARE MISSING.

00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:13.891
AND ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT CHAPTERS THEY

00:48:13.891 --> 00:48:16.393
SAID WAS THE ONE ON
AFRICA, YOU KNOW WHEN HE

00:48:16.393 --> 00:48:19.897
WENT TO ALL THOSE
PROGRESSIVE AFRICAN COUNTRIES.

00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:23.400
ALSO THE CHAPTER ON SISTER
ELLA, I DON'T KNOW WHY

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.401
THAT'S MISSING.

00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:27.404
AND THERE WAS A THIRD
CHAPTER, AND I DON'T KNOW

00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:31.408
IF ANYONE KNOWS WHO HAS
ALL THAT MANUSCRIPT.

00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:35.412
SO PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED, I DON'T THINK.

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:37.915
[SOFTLY] CAN YOU TALK A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DAY

00:48:37.915 --> 00:48:40.417
HE WAS ASSASSINATED?

00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:46.423
OH, THAT WAS FEBRUARY 21ST
1965.

00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:50.928
I THINK THAT DAY WHEN WE
ALL WENT INTO THE AUDUBON,

00:48:50.928 --> 00:48:54.431
I MEAN PEOPLE HAD A
STRANGE FEELING THAT

00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:58.936
SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN,
WELL BECAUSE THERE WAS A

00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:01.438
LOT OF RUMORS LEADING UP
TO IT, BECAUSE NO ONE --

00:49:01.438 --> 00:49:04.942
YOU KNOW THAT WEEK NO ONE
REALLY KNEW WHERE HE WAS

00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:05.943
STAYING.

00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:08.445
HE WANTED TO PROTECT HIS
OWN FAMILY, SO HE DIDN'T

00:49:08.445 --> 00:49:11.949
LET -- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
EVEN IF HIS OWN FAMILY KNEW.

00:49:11.949 --> 00:49:14.952
THE FACT THAT NOT ONE OF
THE PEOPLE THAT WAS

00:49:14.952 --> 00:49:17.955
INVITED TO SPEAK ON THE
PODIUM WITH HIM, THAT NONE

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:22.960
OF THEM SHOWED UP, I MEAN,
I THINK HIS CADRE THOUGHT,

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:27.464
"THAT'S STRANGE, ARE THEY
AFRAID TO COME TODAY AND WHY?"

00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:31.969
BUT TO DISPEL THAT KIND OF
FEAR, YOU KNOW HE TOLD HIS

00:49:31.969 --> 00:49:34.972
GUARDS NOT TO EVEN -- IT'S
TOO BAD, THE PEOPLE WOULD

00:49:34.972 --> 00:49:36.473
THINK IT WAS MISTAKE, HE
TOLD THEM NOT TO CHECK

00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:40.477
ANYONE FOR, YOU KNOW FOR
HARDWARE IF THEY WANTED TO

00:49:40.978 --> 00:49:41.979
CARRY IT IN.

00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:45.482
AND YOU KNOW, PEOPLE
WALKED IN LIKE ANY OTHER

00:49:45.482 --> 00:49:46.984
OF HIS MEETINGS.

00:49:46.984 --> 00:49:51.488
AND UNFORTUNATELY, I GUESS
SOME GUYS DID COME IN AND

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:53.991
THEN -- [SOFTLY] AND THAT
WAS THE DAY THAT IT

00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:56.493
HAPPENED, HIS
ASSASSINATION.

00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:58.495
UMM HMM.

00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:01.498
YEAH IT WAS -- SO WHAT DID
YOU DO?

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:05.002
WELL, PEOPLE WERE JUST
SHOCKED, I MEAN, THE WHOLE

00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:08.005
PLACE WAS IN AN UPROAR.

00:50:08.005 --> 00:50:12.509
BUT THOSE WHO DID IT, I
MEAN CERTAINLY HAD IT WELL

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:16.013
PLANNED OUT TO GET THE
ATTENTION OF EVERYONE IN

00:50:16.013 --> 00:50:19.016
THE AUDITORIUM TO LOOK AT
THEM, YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY

00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:21.518
DID THE DISTRACTION.

00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:24.521
YOU KNOW, WHERE TWO GUYS
JUMPED UP AND ONE OF THEM

00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:27.524
SAID, "GET YOUR HANDS OUT
OF MY POCKET." - RIGHT.

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:31.028
ALL OF US WERE LOOKING AT
THEM WHEN -- THEN ALL OF A

00:50:31.028 --> 00:50:33.530
SUDDEN, WE HEARD THE
SHOOTING AND THERE WERE

00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:37.534
PEOPLE UP FRONT, GUYS WHO
WERE SHOOTING MALCOLM.

00:50:38.035 --> 00:50:41.038
IT WAS JUST A SHOCK AND
THEN OF COURSE I MEAN, ALL

00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:44.541
THE CHAIRS CAME CRASHING
DOWN AND I DON'T KNOW

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:47.044
THERE WAS SCREAMING AND
YELLING AND RUNNING AND IT

00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:49.046
WAS JUST UTTER CHAOS.

UMM HMM.

00:50:51.548 --> 00:50:57.054
PEOPLE WERE JUST, I DON'T
KNOW, I MEAN THE SHOCK

00:50:57.554 --> 00:51:01.058
THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN TO
MALCOLM OF ALL PEOPLE AND

00:51:01.558 --> 00:51:04.561
THIS CERTAINLY WAS I THINK
ONE OF THE GREATEST BLOWS

00:51:05.062 --> 00:51:06.563
TO THE BLACK LIBERATION
MOVEMENT.

00:51:07.064 --> 00:51:08.065
UMM HMM.

00:51:08.065 --> 00:51:11.068
BUT THEN IT DIDN'T STOP
PEOPLE I THINK AFTER THAT,

00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:16.573
THE MOVEMENT MUSHROOMED
INTO A MUCH MORE RADICAL

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:17.574
STRUGGLE.

[♪...]

00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:35.652
JAMES FORMAN GAVE THIS AMAZING
SPEECH ABOUT THE

00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:40.657
IMPORTANCE OF INCLUDING A
CLASS ANALYSIS IN ONE'S

00:52:40.657 --> 00:52:43.160
ANALYSIS OF RACE OR
RACISM. - YEAH.

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:47.164
SO THAT WAS LIKE I THINK
ONE OF THE MOMENTS AT

00:52:47.164 --> 00:52:51.668
WHICH I BECAME PERSUADED
THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO

00:52:51.668 --> 00:52:54.671
MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS,
WHICH MANY PEOPLE DID NOT

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:55.672
-- RIGHT. YES.

00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:56.673
-- WANT TO MAKE IN THOSE
DAYS.

00:52:56.673 --> 00:53:00.177
OF COURSE, NOW EVERY ONE
TALKS ABOUT RACE, CLASS,

00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:01.678
GENDER, SEXUALITY. - YES, I
KNOW!

00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:03.680
[LAUGHTER] IT'S LIKE A
MANTRA. - YEAH!

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:07.184
BUT IN THOSE DAYS WE WERE
GROPING OUR WAY TOWARD AN

MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO BRING

THOSE TOGETHER.

00:53:12.189 --> 00:53:14.191

JAMES FORMAN ALWAYS TALKED

00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:21.698
ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT WOMEN
WERE - OH! I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

TALKED ABOUT RUBY DORIS

CREDIT SHE DESERVES -

00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:38.215
YEAH. RIGHT.

00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:39.716
-- FOR THE ORGANIZING SHE
DID IN THE SOUTH. - YES!

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:42.719
YEAH, BECAUSE PEOPLE KNOW
ALMOST WHO ALL THOSE BIG

00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:45.722

THE WORK.

WHO DID THE REAL WORK.
- UMM HMM.

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:52.229
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF
WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOUNG

00:53:52.229 --> 00:53:55.732
PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO DO
THE ORGANIZING WORK THAT

00:53:55.732 --> 00:53:58.235
WILL LEAD TO SOCIAL
MOVEMENTS THAT WILL

00:53:58.235 --> 00:54:01.238
HOPEFULLY HAVE A RADICAL
IMPACT. - RIGHT.

00:54:01.238 --> 00:54:04.241
WE HAVE TO LEGITIMIZE THE
ROLE OF THE ORGANIZER.

00:54:04.241 --> 00:54:05.242
OH, YEAH!

00:54:05.242 --> 00:54:08.245

LEGITIMIZING WORK THAT,

00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:11.248

HAVE DONE.

TALKING ABOUT HOW

OF THE THIRD WORLD WOMEN'S

AND THAT SORT OF REALLY
POWERFUL EMERGENCE OF

INSISTED ON -- UMM HMM.

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:18.315
RIGHT, BUT YOU KNOW MANY
OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE

00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:22.319
IN THE THIRD WORLD WOMEN'S
ALLIANCE I THINK WERE

00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:25.822
ALSO THOSE WHO ARE AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE FORMATION

OF THE VENCEREMOS BRIGADE.

00:55:27.824 --> 00:55:31.328
I THINK THE WAY YOU TELL
THE HISTORY, IT'S VERY

00:55:31.328 --> 00:55:35.832
CLEAR THAT ALL OF THOSE
STRUGGLES AND ALL OF THOSE

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:38.335
ISSUES ALWAYS INTERSECT.

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:43.340
YES, AND PEOPLE CROSS OVER
AND SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE'S

ISSUES.

00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:47.844
I THINK THAT WHAT HAS
ALWAYS HAPPENED.

00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:51.848
AND REMEMBERING THAT DENISE
OLIVER, FOR EXAMPLE -- YES, YES!

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:53.850
-- YOU KNOW, WHO WAS ONE
OF THE LEADERS OF THE

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:55.852
AND SHE WAS NOT PUERTO
RICAN.

00:55:55.852 --> 00:55:57.854
SHE WAS BLACK. SHE WAS BLACK
RIGHT? - RIGHT!

00:55:57.854 --> 00:55:59.856

MAIN ORGANIZERS IN SNCC

00:56:25.882 --> 00:56:29.386
UNDERSTAND THAT, WHEN
BLACKS HAPPENED TO BE SENT

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:32.389
ALONG WITH AMERICANS
SOLDIERS AT THE TURN OF

00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:34.891
THE CENTURY TO THE
PHILIPPINES, THAT LOT OF

00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:38.395
THOSE BLACK SOLDIERS WERE
APPALLED AT THE BRUTALITY

00:56:38.895 --> 00:56:41.398
OF WHITE AMERICAN
SOLDIERS, THAT THEY WENT

00:56:41.898 --> 00:56:43.900
INTO THE MOUNTAINS, WHEN
THEY WERE IN THE

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.902
PHILIPPINES AND THEY
HOOKED UP WITH THE

00:56:46.403 --> 00:56:47.904
PHILIPPINE GUERRILLAS.

00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:51.908
AND YOU COULD GET PROOF OF
A LOT OF IT BY THE FACT

00:56:51.908 --> 00:56:57.414
THAT SO MANY BLACK NEWS
WRITERS HAD WRITTEN ABOUT

00:56:57.414 --> 00:57:00.917
- THOSE THINGS, YET YOU DON'T
HEAR ABOUT IT THAT MUCH. - TRUE.

00:57:00.917 --> 00:57:03.920
BUT EVEN WAY BACK WHEN
THAT GROUP CALLED SAINT

00:57:04.421 --> 00:57:07.924
PATRICK'S BRIGADE THAT WAS
SENT OUT TO GO AFTER THE

00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:10.927
MEXICANS AND THEY WERE
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY,

00:57:10.927 --> 00:57:14.431
BUT WHEN THEY REALIZED
THAT THOSE POOR MEXICANS

00:57:14.431 --> 00:57:17.934
WERE LIKE THE IRISH
PEASANTS WHO WERE FIGHTING

00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:21.438
FOR THEIR FREEDOM, YOU
KNOW, FROM THE BRITISH.

00:57:21.438 --> 00:57:25.442
WELL THOSE IRISH PEOPLE
WENT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND

00:57:25.942 --> 00:57:26.943
- JOINED THE MEXICANS. - RIGHT.

00:57:27.444 --> 00:57:28.945
I THINK THINGS LIKE THAT
HAVE HAPPENED.

00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:32.449
YEAH, AND BACK IN THE 19TH
CENTURY, THE NATIONAL

00:57:32.949 --> 00:57:36.453
COLORED LABOR UNION WHICH
WAS FORMED BECAUSE BLACK

00:57:36.453 --> 00:57:40.457
PEOPLE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO
JOIN THE NATIONAL LABOR

00:57:40.457 --> 00:57:41.958
UNION -- YEAH. UH HMM.

00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:44.961
-- THAT WAS REALLY THE
ONLY MAJOR LABOR ORGANIZATION

00:57:44.961 --> 00:57:48.465
THAT SPOKE OUT AGAINST THE ASIAN
EXCLUSION LAWS.

00:57:48.465 --> 00:57:51.468
OH, YEAH AND SO DID
FREDERICK DOUGLAS.

00:57:51.468 --> 00:57:55.972
THERE'S BEEN THIS KIND OF
CROSSOVERS ALL OVER, WHERE

00:57:55.972 --> 00:57:58.475
A LOT OF PEOPLE WONDERED,
WHEN PEOPLE SAY HAVE

00:57:58.475 --> 00:58:01.478
ASIANS EVER DONE ANYTHING
FOR AFRICANS?

00:58:01.478 --> 00:58:06.483
WELL, CHINA IN 1965 WHEN
MAO WAS IN POWER, SENT

00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:11.488
THOUSANDS OF WORKERS TO
HELP BUILD THE TANZAM RAILWAY.

00:58:11.488 --> 00:58:12.989
THAT'S RIGHT. ABSOLUTELY.

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:14.991
YEAH, AND THEN WHEN YOU
THINK ON THE OTHER HAND

00:58:15.492 --> 00:58:18.495
HERE WAS A PERSON LIKE HO
CHI MINH WHO SUPPORTED THE

00:58:18.495 --> 00:58:21.998
GARVEY MOVEMENT IN HARLEM
AND WHO ALSO LIVED IN THE

00:58:21.998 --> 00:58:24.501
BLACK COMMUNITY IN
CHICAGO.

00:58:24.501 --> 00:58:26.503
THEN WHEN YOU THINK EVEN
BEFORE THAT IN THE EARLY

00:58:26.503 --> 00:58:30.006
'20'S, PEOPLE LIKE SEN
KATAYAMA, THE JAPANESE

00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:34.511

TOO BAD THAT SO MANY

00:58:38.515 --> 00:58:40.016
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THESE
THINGS.

00:58:40.016 --> 00:58:42.018
- DON'T KNOW THAT HISTORY.
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:47.524
YOU KNOW NAME WAS ANGELA
DAVIS RIGHT, I MEAN IT STILL IS.

00:58:47.524 --> 00:58:51.027
BUT I WAS THAT ANGELA
DAVIS EVERYBODY WAS

00:58:51.528 --> 00:58:57.033
ORGANIZING AROUND AND
TALKING ABOUT.

00:58:57.033 --> 00:59:01.037
AND WHEN I GOT OUT OF
JAIL, WELL FIRST OF ALL IT

00:59:01.037 --> 00:59:05.041
WAS REALLY SCARY AND THAT
WAS ALMOST AS SCARY AS

FACING THE DEATH PENALTY.

00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:11.548
THE IDEA THAT ALL OF THESE
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ALL

00:59:11.548 --> 00:59:18.054
OVER THE WORLD HAD THIS
IDEA ABOUT THIS PERSON

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:21.057
WHOSE NAME WAS ANGELA
DAVIS.

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:24.561
AND YOU KNOW I KEPT
THINKING, YOU KNOW

00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:27.063
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BE
SO DISAPPOINTED!

00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:31.568
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER] THEY
HAD THIS IDEA THAT I WAS A

00:59:31.568 --> 00:59:35.572
DIFFERENT KIND OF
REVOLUTIONARY.

00:59:35.572 --> 00:59:39.576
THAT THE WAY I TALKED
WOULD BE DIFFERENT.

00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:41.578
BECAUSE THERE WERE, YOU
KNOW, CERTAIN NOTIONS OF

WHAT A REVOLUTIONARY WAS
LIKE.

00:59:44.581 --> 00:59:48.585
AND YOU KNOW I TRIED IT,
BUT...[LAUGHS]

00:59:48.585 --> 00:59:52.589
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER] YEARS LATER,
I MEET PEOPLE

00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:57.594
AND THEY -- YOU KNOW
THEY TELL ME THE STORIES.

00:59:58.094 --> 01:00:03.099
THEY HAVE STORIES THROUGH
THE CAMPAIGN AROUND MY

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:07.103
CASE THAT LINK THEM TO
THEIR PAST AND I THINK

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:10.106
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT
PARTICULARLY SINCE THIS

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:14.611
STORY IS NOT RECORDED IN
THE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:17.614

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:50.647
KNOW THAT YOU AND GEORGE
JACKSON WERE VERY CLOSE.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:52.649
WELL, HOW DID YOU MEET?

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:56.653

THE CHE-LUMUMBA CLUB OF
THE COMMUNIST PARTY.

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:06.162
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
THERE WAS A STATUTE ON THE

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:09.666

OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAD

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:12.168

-- WHO WAS A MEMBER OF THE
COMMUNIST PARTY.

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.678
SO THAT'S WHERE THAT -- I
HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE WAS

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:25.682
SUCH A STATUTE, 'CAUSE I
WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE

AS THIS "DANGEROUS COMMUNIST."

[LAUGHS].

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:30.747
SO I GOT -- YOU KNOW

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:00.777
GEORGE THEN LEARNED ABOUT
THE WORK THAT I WAS DOING

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:03.279

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:08.284

HIM INDIVIDUALLY, I THINK TWICE.

I FELT THAT SINCE I WAS
FIGHTING FOR MY RIGHT TO

TEACH AND SINCE THE
ARGUMENT I WAS MAKING WAS

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:21.798
THAT THE REGENTS WANTED TO
FIRE ME BECAUSE OF

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:23.299
MY RADICAL POLITICS

01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:24.300
-- YEAH! UH-HUH.

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:29.305
-- NOT BECAUSE I WASN'T
ABLE TO CARRY OUT THE JOB

FOR WHICH I WAS HIRED.

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:32.809

SIMILAR SITUATION WITH THE

THEY WERE BEING CHARGED

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:38.815
WITH MURDER BECAUSE OF
THEIR POLITICS AND NOT

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:42.819
BECAUSE THEY WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTUAL

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:44.821

THE KILLING OF

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:47.323

OH YEAH, HE WAS KILLED A

A COUPLE OF MONTHS AFTER
JONATHAN WAS KILLED.

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:09.846

TO DEVELOP THE CASE FOR

AFTER I HAD

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:13.349
BEEN ARRESTED MYSELF.

THOUGHT ABOUT HOW TO BUILD

THE HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:50.887

BECAUSE OF -- BECAUSE THEY

WERE TARGETS OF RACISM?

RECOGNIZE ME.

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:07.463
I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD
HAVE RECOGNIZED ME, I WAS

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:10.967
PRETTY WELL MADE UP,
ESPECIALLY SINCE PEOPLE

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:15.972
ASSOCIATED ME WITH, YOU

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:17.974

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.476
WELL, I HAD ON A WIG.

I'VE EVER HAD ON IN MY LIFE.

- AH! MUST HAVE BEEN SCARY.

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:36.993
AND THEN, WAIT, WHERE DID
THEY MOVE YOU AFTER THAT?

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:41.497
THEY EXTRADITED ME TO
CALIFORNIA AND I WAS TAKEN

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:42.999

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:47.503
WHERE I STAYED FOR ABOUT A
YEAR.

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:50.006
BECAUSE I NEVER HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUTSIDE

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:54.010
AND I WAS PALE, MY EYES
GOT WORSE BECAUSE I NEVER

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:56.012
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
USE THEM.

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:57.013
OH.

01:06:57.513 --> 01:07:00.516
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE JUST
IN A CELL AND YOU GOT TO

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:04.520
LOOK SAY SIX FEET ACROSS
THE ROOM AND THEN SUDDENLY

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.024
YOU GO INTO A LARGER SPACE
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:14.530

SORT OF TAKE NOTE OF THE

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:17.033

ARE SITTING HERE AND

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:19.535
THAT'S QUITE AMAZING
BECAUSE WE HAVE --

THINKING ABOUT THE

I MEAN IT WAS BECAUSE OF
CHARLENE MITCHELL THAT I

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.555
JOINED THE COMMUNIST
PARTY.

PLAYED -- BOTH OF WHOM

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:55.071
PLAYED AN ENORMOUS ROLE IN
BUILDING THIS CAMPAIGN.

01:07:55.071 --> 01:08:00.076

SINCE, BEFORE I WAS BORN.

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:15.091
AND WHEN I WAS ARRESTED
AND GOT TAKEN TO THE FBI

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:18.094
BUILDING, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE THEY WERE TAKING ME

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:20.096
OR WHAT WAS GOING ON, THEY
WOULDN'T LET ME MAKE A

THOUGHT THAT THEY ARE

GOING TO KILL ME, BECAUSE
I HADN'T -- I HAD NO

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.603
CONTACT WITH ANYONE, THESE
-- I REFUSED TO SPEAK TO

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:31.607

I LEARNED AS A CHILD THAT

01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:33.609
YOU DON'T TALK TO THE FBI.

01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:39.115
AND FINALLY THEY TOLD ME
THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE WHO

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:43.119
SAID SHE WAS MY ATTORNEY,
BUT SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE

01:08:43.119 --> 01:08:45.121
WAS ABOUT 16 YEARS OLD.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:51.127
[LAUGHTER] AND THEY DIDN'T
BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS AN ATTORNEY.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:54.630
[LAUGHTER] SO MARGARET WAS
THE FIRST ATTORNEY AND OF

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:57.633

THAT SHE WAS THERE MEANT

EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD TO
ME.

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:03.139
AND SHE STAYED WITH THE
CASE UNTIL THE ACQUITTAL

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:05.641
THAT WAS 18 MONTHS LATER,

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:12.648
AND SHE BROUGHT HER FAMILY
OUT TO CALIFORNIA.

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:16.152
I MEAN SHE MOVED, AND WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR HELPING TO

TEAM.

NOT GUILTY, WE THOUGHT WE

01:09:21.657 --> 01:09:24.660
WOULD LOSE THIS WOMAN, WE
REALLY DID.

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:28.664
BUT WHAT STRIKES ME AS
NEARLY MIRACULOUS, EVERY

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:33.669
TIME I THINK ABOUT THIS
CAMPAIGN AND THIS CASE, IS

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:36.172
THAT ANGELA'S VOICE, THE
VOICE THAT WE'VE JUST

01:09:36.172 --> 01:09:40.676
HEARD, THAT WORK, THOSE
BOOKS, THOSE RALLIES SHE'S

ATTENDED, HER CONTINUING

RETHINK THE PROBLEMS THAT
WE FACE AS A COUNTRY AND

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:54.190
AS A MOVEMENT TO BRING TO
US THE ISSUE OF PRISONS IN

01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:56.692
THE WAY IN WHICH -- THE
LEADERSHIP THAT SHE HAS

01:09:56.692 --> 01:10:00.196
GIVEN TO THAT ISSUE, THAT
WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENCED,

FOLLOWING ANGELA'S BEING
PUT ON THE FBI'S MOST

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:13.209

CAMPAIGN TO SECURE HER

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:18.214
RIGHT TO COME BACK INTO AN
ENVIRONMENT THAT WOULD

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:20.716
PERMIT HER TO COME BACK
WITHOUT BEING KILLED,

01:10:20.716 --> 01:10:23.719
BECAUSE ONCE YOU'RE ON THE
FBI'S MOST WANTED LIST,

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:24.720
YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE A
RIGHT TO KILL YOU,

TO BRING YOU BACK.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:28.724
AND THE OTHER WAS TO --
THAT SHE WOULD HAVE A FAIR

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:31.227
HEARING AND THAT WAS
CERTAINLY NOT TO BE HAD.

01:10:31.727 --> 01:10:35.231
THIS WAS CLEARLY "THE" BIG
CASE, NOT ONLY AGAINST

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:39.235
ANGELA, BUT FOR THE FBI,
BECAUSE THEY WERE MAKING

WERE GOING TO STOP ALL

THIS QUOTE: "TERRORISM IN
ITS TRACKS."

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:47.243

THAT WAS -- YOU KNOW THIS

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:08.764
WAS A MAJOR EFFORT,
BECAUSE NOT AT ALL TIMES

01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:11.267

ABOUT ABU GHRAIB, WE'VE
HEARD ABOUT GUANTANAMO,

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:18.553
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT ALL OF
THE CIA SECRET PRISONS,

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:23.058
SUBJECT TO RENDITION SO
THAT THEY CAN BE TORTURED

IN COUNTRIES - UH HMM.

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:27.562
-- THAT ENGAGE IN THAT
PRACTICE, WHICH THEN

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:28.563
ALLOWS THE U.S.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:33.068
TO WIPE ITS HANDS AND
ARGUE THAT, YOU KNOW,

01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:36.071
TORTURE ISN'T A STRATEGY
THAT THE U.S.

01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:38.073
GOVERNMENT [BOTH AT THE
SAME TIME] USES.

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:40.575
BUT WE KNOW THAT TORTURE
GOES ON IN DOMESTIC PRISONS.

01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:41.576
- OF COURSE!

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:47.582
BUT I THINK WE'VE GOT TO
GIVE A LOT MORE ATTENTION

01:24:47.582 --> 01:24:50.085
TO STOP U.S. WARS WHERE EVER.

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:55.090
I MEAN, DID YOU THINK THE
MOVEMENT AGAINST THE WAR

01:24:55.090 --> 01:25:01.096
IS NOT AS POWERFUL AS IT
WAS AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR?

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:05.600
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY I THINK
THE SENTIMENT IS EVEN MORE

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.601
POWERFUL.

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:07.602
[PROTESTERS CHANTING]

"NO BLOOD FOR OIL!"

01:25:14.609 --> 01:25:19.114
WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT OVER
THE LAST YEARS, WE'VE HAD

01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:22.117
DEMONSTRATIONS THAT HAVE
BEEN SO MUCH LARGER THAN

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:26.121
ANY OF THE ANTI-VIETNAM
WAR DEMONSTRATIONS, IT'S

01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:30.625
NOT SO MUCH THE FACT THAT
PEOPLE ARE LESS OPPOSED TO

01:25:30.625 --> 01:25:32.127
WAR THAN THEY WERE THEN.

01:25:32.627 --> 01:25:38.633
IT'S A QUESTION OF HOW WE
TRANSFORM THOSE SENTIMENTS

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:43.138
INTO OPPOSITIONAL
POLITICAL STANCES.

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:48.143
DO YOU THINK AMERICAN
PEOPLE REALIZE LIKE THAT

NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:07.662
THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE!

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:11.666
- WHEN PEOPLE WERE OPPOSED
TO THE WAR IN VIETNAM,

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:15.170
THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME
EMPATHY, SOME SENSE OF

IDENTIFICATION WITH
VIETNAMESE PEOPLE, WHEREAS

01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:23.178
MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE
AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ

01:26:23.678 --> 01:26:28.183
TODAY DON'T THINK ABOUT
IRAQI PEOPLE AT ALL.

THERE IS NO -- THERE IS NO

- SENSE OF CONNECTION. - AH HA.

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:38.693
WHAT I THINK IS THAT THE
NATIONALISM -- [CROWD CHEERING]

OBSTACLE. - UMM HMM.

DETENTIONS INSIDE THE U.S.

THE U.S. DRIVE FOR EMPIRE.

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:04.719
AND THIS IS WHY I THINK
THAT ABOLITION -- LIKE

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:08.723
DEATH PENALTY ABOLITION,
PRISON ABOLITION IS SO

01:27:08.723 --> 01:27:09.724
IMPORTANT. - UMM HMM.

PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTIVE IN

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:19.234
THAT MOVEMENT IS TO CREATE
A VOCABULARY THAT WILL

01:27:19.734 --> 01:27:24.239
ALLOW THEM TO PERSUADE
OTHER PEOPLE THAT THE

ISN'T ONLY ABOUT PRISONS.

IT'S ABOUT HOUSING, JOBS.

END TO RACISM.

RIGID IDEA ABOUT WHAT IT

UNDERSTAND BETTER HOW THAT
HAPPENS, SO THAT IT'S NOT

THERE ARE MANY THINGS

WRONG AND IF THEY WANT TO

01:31:58.513 --> 01:32:03.017
CHANGE IT, TO MAKE THE

01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:07.021
TO BE THE ACTIVIST AND
PARTICIPATE.

ALWAYS ENCOURAGED

THE DIVISIONS THAT USUALLY
KEEP US APART -- OH YES!

01:32:21.035 --> 01:32:26.040
THERE MUST BE THAT KIND OF
ALLIANCE, THAT KIND OF

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:29.043

OKAY, SO WHERE DO YOU
THINK IT HAS TO BEGIN?

01:32:38.052 --> 01:32:41.556
WELL, I THINK IT BEGINS
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

01:32:41.556 --> 01:32:42.557
[LAUGHS] OH YEAH.

RIGHT, RIGHT.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.061
I MEAN MY SENSE HAS ALWAYS
BEEN THAT ACTIVISM ISN'T

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:48.563
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

01:32:48.563 --> 01:32:50.565
IT'S NOT LOCATED IN A
PARTICULAR SPACE.

OH, RIGHT.

01:32:52.066 --> 01:32:54.569
IT'S ABOUT DOING THE WORK
YOU'RE ABLE TO DO --

RIGHT.

OR SOON AS YOU HEAR
SOMETHING LIKE, YOU'RE

01:33:04.078 --> 01:33:07.582
JUST READING A NEWSPAPER
AND FINDING OUT SOME VERY

01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:13.588
TERRIBLE STORY ABOUT
INJUSTICE THAT -- AND I

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:20.595
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE EVEN
IMMEDIATELY RESPOND.

01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:25.600
AND THEN IF THEY COULD
ACTUALLY -- ORGANIZING AND

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:29.604
GETTING MORE PEOPLE TO
RESPOND.

01:33:29.604 --> 01:33:33.107
YOU ASK YOURSELF, YOU
KNOW, HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE

01:33:33.107 --> 01:33:36.110
TO BUILD SUCH AN AMAZING
MOVEMENT AGAINST APARTHEID

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:37.612
IN SOUTH AFRICA?

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:38.613
UMM HMM.

01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:40.615
SO I THINK THE REAL
CHALLENGE IS TO BUILD A

01:33:40.615 --> 01:33:44.118
SENSE OF TRANSNATIONAL
COMMUNITY.

01:33:44.118 --> 01:33:45.119
UMM HMM.

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:47.622
TRANSNATIONAL
SOLIDARITIES.

01:33:47.622 --> 01:33:51.626
AND THEN PERHAPS OUR
EFFORT TO END THE WARS

01:33:51.626 --> 01:33:56.130
AGAINST SO CALLED
"TERROR," THE WAR IN IRAQ

01:33:56.631 --> 01:33:59.133
AND TO PREVENT A WAR IN
IRAN WILL HAVE A LOT MORE

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:01.636
-SUBSTANCE.
-UMM HMM.

01:34:01.636 --> 01:34:08.142
WILL LEAD PEOPLE TO FEEL A
CONNECTION WITH THOSE WHO

01:34:08.142 --> 01:34:10.144
ARE SUFFERING U.S. AGGRESSION

01:34:10.144 --> 01:34:15.650
NOT SIMPLY TO SAY THIS
IS A THREAT TO U.S.

01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:18.152
-DEMOCRACY.
-UMM HMM.

01:34:18.152 --> 01:34:22.657
BUT THAT THIS HURTS MEN
AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN

01:34:22.657 --> 01:34:27.161
WAYS THAT WE WOULD NEVER
WANT OUR FAMILY MEMBERS TO

01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:28.663
-BE HURT.
-UH-HUH.

01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:33.167
IT'S ABOUT HOW ONE
APPROACHES ONE'S COMMUNITY

01:34:33.167 --> 01:34:37.672
AND IT'S ABOUT TEACHING
PEOPLE I THINK TO THINK

01:34:37.672 --> 01:34:42.176
AND IMAGINE BEYOND THE
PRESENT MOMENT.

01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:43.678
RIGHT.

01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:45.680
AND NOT IMPRISONED IN THE
PRESENT.

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:47.181
YEAH.

01:34:47.181 --> 01:34:51.185
WE ARE NOT PRISONERS OF
THIS EFFORT TO SPREAD WAR

01:34:51.185 --> 01:34:53.688
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE CAN

01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:57.692
COME TOGETHER AND
BELIEVE IN AND STRUGGLE

01:34:57.692 --> 01:35:00.194
FOR A BETTER WORLD.

01:35:00.194 --> 01:35:01.195
UMM HMM.

01:35:01.696 --> 01:35:05.199
AND I MEAN THE FUTURE DOES
BELONG TO THE YOUTH

01:35:05.199 --> 01:35:07.702
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONLY
ONES THAT WOULD CHANGE

01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:09.704
TOMORROW!

01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:11.706
YEAH OKAY, SO...

01:35:11.706 --> 01:35:13.207
YEAH.

01:35:13.207 --> 01:35:14.208
SO THAT'S THE CHALLENGE,
RIGHT?

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:15.209
OKAY, RIGHT.

01:35:15.209 --> 01:35:16.711
YEAH.
