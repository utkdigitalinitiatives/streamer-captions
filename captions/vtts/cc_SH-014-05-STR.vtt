00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.570


2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.470


3
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.630
In such a night as this,

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.030
when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees

5
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.670
and they did make no noise,

6
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.600
in such a night,

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.400
Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.530
and sighed his soul towards the Grecian tents

9
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.400
where Cressid lay that night.

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.900
In such a night did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew

11
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.330
and saw the lion's shadow ere himself

12
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.330
and ran dismayed away.

13
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.030
In such a night stood Dido with a willow in her hand

14
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.700
upon the wild sea-banks

15
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.270
and waft her love to come again to Carthage.

16
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.600
In such a night, Medea gathered

17
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.870
the enchanted herbs that did renew old Aeson.

18
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.970
In such a night did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew,

19
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.530
and with an unthrift love,

20
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.930
did run from Venice as far as Belmont.

21
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.730
In such a night

22
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.600
did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,

23
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.800
stealing her soul with many vows of faith

24
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.230
and ne'er a true one.

25
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.100
In such a night did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,

26
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.000
slander her love, and he forgave it her.

27
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.800
I would out-night you, did nobody come.

28
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.870
But hark, I hear the footing of a man.

29
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.730
Who comes so fast in silence of the night?

30
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.000
A friend.

31
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.200
A friend?

32
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.400
What friend?

33
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.370
Your name, I pray you, friend.

34
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.800
Stephano is my name,

35
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.730
and I bring word that my mistress will,

36
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.100
before the break of day, be here at Belmont.

37
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.400
She doth stray about by holy crosses

38
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.530
where she kneels and prays for happy wedlock hours.

39
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.970
Who comes with her?

40
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.130
None but a holy hermit and her maid.

41
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.230
I pray you, is my master yet returned?

42
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.430
He is not yet, nor we have not heard from him.

43
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.600
But go we in.

44
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.230
I pray thee, Jessica,

45
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.800
and ceremoniously let us prepare

46
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.800
some welcome for the mistress of the house.

47
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.430
Sola, sola!

48
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.630
Wo ha, hoo.

49
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.830
Sola! Sola!

50
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.000
Who calls?

51
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.100
Sola!

52
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.670
Did you see master Lorenzo?

53
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.530
Master Lorenzo-oo?

54
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.730
Sola! Sola!

55
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.900
Leave holloaing, man, here.

56
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.000
Sola!

57
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.170
Where?

58
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.270
Here!

59
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.900
Tell him there's a post come from my master

60
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.470
with his horn full of good news.

61
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.270
My master will be here ere morning.

62
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.030
Sweet soul, let's in and there expect their coming.

63
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.200
And yet no matter.

64
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.070
Why should we go in?

65
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.070
My friend, Stephano, signify, I pray you,

66
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.230
within the house--

67
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.530
your mistress is at hand--

68
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.600
and bring your music forth into the air.

69
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.500
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank.

70
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.770
Here will we sit

71
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.170
and let the sounds of music creep in our ears.

72
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.630
Soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony.

73
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.870
Sit, Jessica.

74
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.670
Look how the floor of heaven

75
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.800
is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold.

76
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.730
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st

77
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.630
but in his motion like an angel sings

78
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.430
still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins.

79
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.070
Such harmony is in immortal souls.

80
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.230
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay

81
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.100
doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.

82
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.770
Come, ho, and wake Diana with a hymn.

83
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.730
With sweetest touches, pierce your mistress' ear

84
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.270
and draw her home with music.

85
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.100
I am never merry when I hear sweet music.

86
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.670
The reason is your spirits are attentive.

87
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.330
For do but note a wild and wanton herd

88
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.930
or race of youthful and unhandled colts

89
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.370
fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,

90
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.670
which is the hot condition of their blood.

91
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.330
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound

92
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.630
or any air of music touch their ears,

93
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.970
you shall perceive them make a mutual stand,

94
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.700
their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze

95
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.500
by the sweet power of music.

96
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.830
Therefore the poet did feign

97
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.570
that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods,

98
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.930
since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,

99
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.700
but music for the time doth change his nature.

100
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.570
The man that hath no music in himself,

101
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.800
nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,

102
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.000
is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.

103
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.100
The motions of his spirit are dull as night,

104
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.800
and his affections dark as Erebus.

105
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.230
Let no such man be trusted.

106
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.370
Mark the music.

107
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.830
That light we see is burning in my hall.

108
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.430
How far that little candle throws his beams.

109
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.530
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.

110
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.100
When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.

111
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.530
So doth the greater glory dim the less.

112
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.270
A substitute shines brightly as a king

113
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.500
until a king be by,

114
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.900
and then his state empties itself

115
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.170
as doth an inland brook into the main of waters.

116
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.430
Music, hark.

117
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.470
It is your music, madam, of the house.

118
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.030
Nothing is good, I see, without respect.

119
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.100
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.

120
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.730
Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.

121
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.370
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark

122
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.770
when neither is attended,

123
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.200
and I think the nightingale, if she should sing by day

124
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.500
when every goose is cackling,

125
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.130
would be thought no better a musician than the wren.

126
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.400
How many things by season seasoned

127
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.130
are to their right praise and true perfection.

128
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.070
Peace, ho.

129
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.400
The moon sleeps with Endymion and would not be awaked.

130
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.430
That is the voice, or I am much deceived, of Portia.

131
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.670
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo

132
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:33.970
by the bad voice.

133
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.630
Dear lady, welcome home.

134
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.170
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare,

135
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.070
which speed, we hope, the better for our words.

136
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.670
Are they returned?

137
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.170
Madam, they are not yet,

138
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.130
but there has come a messenger before

139
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.500
to signify their coming.

140
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.770
Go in, Nerissa, give order to my servants

141
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.100
that they take no note at all of our being absent hence.

142
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.730
Nor you, Lorenzo-- Jessica, nor you.

143
00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.370
Your husband is at hand.

144
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.600
I hear his trumpet.

145
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.770
We are no telltales, madam.

146
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.070
Fear you not.

147
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.570
This night methinks is but the daylight sick.

148
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:07.900
It looks a little paler.

149
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.100
'Tis a day such as the day is when the sun is hid.

150
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.170
We should hold day with the antipodes

151
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.570
if you would walk in absence of the sun.

152
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.070
Let me give light, but let me not be light,

153
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.400
for a light wife doth make a heavy husband,

154
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.470
and never be Bassanio so for me.

155
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.470
But God sort all.

156
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.600
You are welcome home, my lord.

157
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.570
I thank you, madam.

158
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.870
Give welcome to my friend.

159
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.700
This is the man.

160
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.670
This is Antonio,

161
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:41.800
to whom I am so infinitely bound.

162
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.830
You should in all sense be much bound to him,

163
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.670
for, as I hear, he was much bound for you.

164
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.600
No more than I am well acquitted of.

165
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.830
Sir, you are very welcome to our house.

166
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.800
It must appear in other ways than words.

167
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.230
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.

168
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.070
By yonder moon, I swear you do me wrong.

169
00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.400
In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk.

170
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.530
Would he were gelt that had it for my part

171
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:04.270
since you do take it, love, so much at heart.

172
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.370
A quarrel?

173
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.530
Ho, already?

174
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:07.730
What's the matter?

175
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.100
About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring that she did give me

176
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.570
whose posy was, for all the world, like cutler's poetry upon a knife.

177
00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.900
"Love me, and leave me not."

178
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.230
What talk you of the posy or the value?

179
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.770
You swore to me when I did give it to you

180
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.870
that you would wear it till your hour of death

181
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.970
and that it should lie with you in your grave.

182
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.930
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,

183
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.500
you should have been respective and kept it.

184
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.430
Gave it a judge's clerk.

185
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.100
No, God's my judge, the clerk will ne'er wear hair

186
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.600
on's face that had it.

187
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.100
He will, an if he live to be a man.

188
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.630
Ay, if a woman live to be a man.

189
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.700
Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,

190
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.730
a kind of boy,

191
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.670
a little scrubbed boy no higher than thyself,

192
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:52.530
the judge's clerk, a prating boy that begged it as a fee.

193
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.530
I could not for my heart deny it him.

194
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:55.730
You were to blame.

195
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.570
I must be plain with you.

196
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.530
To part so slightly with your wife's first gift,

197
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.530
a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger

198
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.030
and so riveted with faith unto your flesh.

199
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.970
I gave my love a ring, and here he stands.

200
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.200
I dare be sworn for him, he would not leave it

201
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.730
nor pluck it from his finger

202
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.100
for the wealth that the world masters.

203
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.400
Now in faith, Gratiano,

204
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.830
you gave your wife too unkind a cause of grief.

205
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.570
An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.

206
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.470
Why, I were best to cut my left hand off

207
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.400
and swear I lost the ring defending it.

208
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.800
My lord, Bassanio, gave his ring away

209
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.270
unto the judge that begged it, and indeed deserved it too.

210
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.570
And then the boy, his clerk, that took some pains in writing,

211
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.930
he begged mine, and neither man nor master

212
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.170
would take aught but the two rings.

213
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.270
What ring gave you, my lord?

214
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:46.870
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.

215
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:52.400
If I could add a lie unto a fault, I would deny it.

216
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.100
But you see my finger hath not the ring upon it.

217
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.030
It is gone.

218
00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:01.770
Even so void is your false heart of truth.

219
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:07.400
By heaven, I shall ne'er come in your bed until I see the ring.

220
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.900
Nor I in yours till I again see mine.

221
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.230
Sweet Portia,

222
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.230
if you did know to whom I gave the ring,

223
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.670
if you did know for whom I gave the ring,

224
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.270
and would conceive for what I gave the ring

225
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.430
and how unwillingly I left the ring

226
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.330
when naught would be accepted but the ring,

227
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.600
you would abate the strength of your displeasure.

228
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.800
If you had known the virtue of the ring,

229
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.630
or half her worthiness that gave the ring,

230
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.400
or your own honor to contain the ring,

231
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.970
you would not then have parted with the ring.

232
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.000
What man is there so much unreasonable,

233
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.770
if you had pleased to have defended it with any terms of zeal,

234
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.500
wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony?

235
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.700
Nerissa teaches me what to believe.

236
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.270
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.

237
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:55.100
No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,

238
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.000
no woman had it,

239
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.230
but a civil doctor which did refuse 3,000 ducats of me

240
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.730
and begged the ring, the which I did deny him

241
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.570
and suffered him to go displeased away,

242
00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:11.270
even he that had held up the very life of my dear friend.

243
00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:14.100
What should I say, sweet lady?

244
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.330
I was enforced to send it after him.

245
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.000
I was beset with shame and courtesy.

246
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.470
My honour would not let ingratitude so much besmear it.

247
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.100
Pardon me, good lady.

248
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.030
For by these blessed candles of the night

249
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.370
had you been there,

250
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.600
I think you would have begged the ring of me

251
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.870
to give the worthy doctor.

252
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.730
Let not that doctor e'er come near my house.

253
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.230
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved

254
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.770
and that which you did swear to keep for me,

255
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.800
I will become as liberal as you.

256
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.100
I'll not deny him anything I have.

257
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.970
No, not my body nor my husband's bed.

258
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.300
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.

259
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.370
Lie not a night from home.

260
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.700
Watch me like Argus.

261
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.970
If you do not, if I am left alone,

262
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.400
now by mine honour, which is yet mine own,

263
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.670
I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.

264
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.970
And I his clerk.

265
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.870
Therefore, be well advised

266
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.930
how you do leave me to mine own protection.

267
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.330
Well, do you so.

268
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.070
Let not me take him then.

269
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.000
For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.

270
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.900
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.

271
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.430
Sir, grieve not you, you are welcome notwithstanding.

272
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:22.200
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong,

273
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.100
and in the hearing of these many friends,

274
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.930
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes

275
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:29.130
wherein I see myself--

276
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.830
Mark you but that!

277
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.570
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,

278
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:34.800
in each eye one.

279
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.670
Swear by your double self, and there's an oath of credit.

280
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.770
Nay, but hear me.

281
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.930
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear,

282
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.070
I never more will break an oath with thee.

283
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.430
I once did lend my body for his wealth,

284
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.970
which but for him that had your husband's ring,

285
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.800
had quite miscarried.

286
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.300
I dare be bound again, my soul upon the forfeit,

287
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.830
that your lord will never more break faith advisedly.

288
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.600
Then you shall be his surety.

289
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.530
Give him this,

290
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.030
and bid him keep it better than the other.

291
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.770
Here, lord Bassanio,

292
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.670
swear to keep this ring.

293
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:22.270
By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor.

294
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.570
I had it of him.

295
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.730
Pardon me, Bassanio,

296
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.730
for by this ring, the doctor lay with me.

297
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.170
And pardon me, my gentle Graciano,

298
00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:36.170
for that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,

299
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.670
in lieu of this last night did lie with me.

300
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.600
Why, this is like the mending of highways in summer

301
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.330
where the ways are fair enough.

302
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.970
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?

303
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.230
Speak not so grossly.

304
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.370
You are all amazed.

305
00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.900
Here is a letter.

306
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.070
Read it at your leisure.

307
00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.470
It comes from Padua from Bellario.

308
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:08.470
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,

309
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.100
Nerissa there her clerk.

310
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.970
Lorenzo here shall witness I set forth as soon as you

311
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.230
and but now returned.

312
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.230
I have not yet entered my house.

313
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.070
Antonio, you are welcome,

314
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.130
and I have better news in store for you than you expect.

315
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.930
Unseal this letter soon.

316
00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.600
There you shall find that three of your argosies

317
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.630
are richly come to harbour suddenly.

318
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.370
You shall not know by what strange accident

319
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.170
I chanced on this letter.

320
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.270
I am dumb.

321
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.730
Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?

322
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.400
Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?

323
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.000
Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it

324
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.770
unless he live until he be a man.

325
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.370
Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow.

326
00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:00.770
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.

327
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.400
Sweet lady,

328
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.070
you have given me life and living,

329
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:12.600
for here I read for certain that my ships are safely come to road.

330
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.600
How now, Lorenzo?

331
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.870
My clerk hath some good comforts, too, for you.

332
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.170
Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.

333
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:28.270
There do I give to you and Jessica from the rich Jew

334
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.700
a special deed of gift

335
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.430
after his death of all he dies possessed of.

336
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:36.170
Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way of starved people.

337
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.330
It is almost morning,

338
00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.970
and yet I am sure you are not satisfied

339
00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.100
of these events at full.

340
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:49.400
Let us go in, and charge us there upon inter'gatories,

341
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.530
and we will answer all things faithfully.

342
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.200
Let it be so.

343
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.800
The first inter'gatory that my Nerissa shall be sworn on is

344
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.730
whether till the next night she had rather stay

345
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.970
or go to bed now, being two hours to day.

346
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.630
But were the day come, I should wish it dark

347
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:11.400
till I were couching with the doctor's clerk.

348
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.900
Well, while I live, I'll fear no other thing

349
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:20.770
so sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.

350
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.270
