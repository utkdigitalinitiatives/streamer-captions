78
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.700

I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.

83
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.500
How does your fallow greyhound, sir?

84
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.230
I heard say he was outrun on Cotsall.

85
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.170
It could not be judged, sir.

86
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.800
You'll not confess, you'll not confess.

87
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.770
That he will not. 'Tis your fault,

88
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.900
'tis your fault; 'tis a good dog.

89
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.700
A cur, sir.

90
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.070
(laughing)

91
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.700
Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog:

92
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.130
can there be more said? he is good and fair.

93
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.370
Is Sir John Falstaff here?

94
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.670
Sir, he is within;

95
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.570
and I would I could do a good office between you.

96
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.730
It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.

97
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.170
He hath wronged me, Master Page.

98
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.430
Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.

99
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.530
If it be confessed, it is not redress'd:

100
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.930
is not that so, Master Page?

101
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.630
He hath wronged me; indeed he hath,

102
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.430
at a word, he hath, believe me:

103
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.200
Robert Shallow, esquire, saith, he is wronged.

104
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.530
Here comes Sir John.

105
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.500
Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the king?

106
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.370
Knight, you have beaten my men,

107
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.230
killed my deer, and broke open my lodge.

108
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.670
But not kissed your keeper's daughter?

109
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.600
Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.

110
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.070
I will answer it straight; I have done all this.

111
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.000
That is now answered.

112
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.870
The council shall know this.

113
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.800
'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel:

114
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.930
you'll be laughed at.

115
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.270
Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.

116
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.230
Good worts! good cabbage.

117
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.900
Slender, I broke your head:

118
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.600
what matter have you against me?

119
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.200
Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you;

120
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.800
and against your cony-catching rascals,

121
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.500
Bardolph, Nym, and Pistol.

122
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.070
They carried me to the tavern,

123
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.630
made me drunk, and afterward picked my pocket!

124
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.800
You Banbury cheese!

125
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.770
Ay, it is no matter.

126
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.430
How now, Mephostophilus!

127
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.270
Ay, it is no matter.

128
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:13.470
Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice!

129
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.430
that's my humour.

130
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.600
Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?

131
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.830
I pray you, peace. Now let us understand.

132
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.330
There is three umpires in this matter,

133
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.530
as I understand;

134
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.300
that is, Master Page, fidelicet Master Page;

135
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.030
and there is myself, fidelicet myself;

136
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.400
and the three party is,

137
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.100
lastly and finally,

138
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.430
mine host of the Garter.

139
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.770
We three, to hear it and end it between them.

140
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.230
Fery goot:

141
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.930
I will make a prief of it in my note-book;

142
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.130
and afterwords we will work upon the cause

143
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.070
with as great discreetly as we can.

144
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.130
Pistol!

145
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.000
He hears with ears.

146
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this,

147
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.300
'He hears with ear'? why, it is affectations.

148
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.930
Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?

149
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.200
Ay, by these gloves, did he,

150
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.770
or I would I might never come

151
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:17.900
in mine own great chamber again else,

152
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.500
of seven groats in mill-sixpences,

153
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.600
and two Edward shovel-boards, of Yead Miller

154
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.130
that cost me two shilling and two pence apiece

155
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.870
of Yead Miller, by these gloves.

156
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.700
Is this true, Pistol?

157
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.270
No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.

158
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.770
Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine,

159
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.700
I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.

160
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.230
Word of denial in thy labras here!

161
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:48.670
Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!

162
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.000
By these gloves, then, 'twas he.

163
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.230
Be avised, sir, and pass good humours:

164
00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:00.230
I will say 'marry trap' with you,

165
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:08.230
if you run the nuthook's humour on me;

166
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.430
that is the very note of it.

167
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.930
By this hat, then, he in the red face had it;

168
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.630
for though I cannot remember

169
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:16.930
what I did when you made me drunk,

170
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.930
yet I am not altogether an ass.

171
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.570
What say you, Scarlet and John?

172
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.600
Why, sir, for my part

173
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.070
I say the gentleman had drunk himself

174
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.530
out of his five sentences.

175
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:32.800
It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance is!

176
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.100
And being fap, sir, was, as they say,

177
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:41.270
cashiered; and so conclusions passed the careires.

178
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.000
Ay, you spake in Latin then too;

179
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.200
but 'tis no matter:

180
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.130
I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again,

181
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.970
but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:

182
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.270
if I be drunk,

183
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.570
I'll be drunk with those that have

184
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.330
the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.

185
00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:59.030
So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.

186
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:02.000
You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen;

187
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.500
you hear it.

188
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.700
Nay, daughter, carry the wine in;

189
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.500
we'll drink within.

190
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.130
O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.

191
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.330
How now, Mistress Ford!

192
00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:23.730
Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met:

193
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.970
by your leave, good mistress.

194
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.070
My husband's name is Ford, sir.

195
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.270
Well I shall desire

196
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.630
more acquaintance of you.

197
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.100
The like of you, good Mistress Page.

198
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.530
With all my heart, Sir John.

199
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.900
Come, husband, you go? Dinner stays for us.

200
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.500
Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome.

201
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.430
Come, we have a hot venison pasty to dinner:

202
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.070
come, gentlemen, I hope we shall drink down

203
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.070
all unkindness.

204
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.200
I had rather than forty shillings

205
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.600
I had my Book of Songs and Sonnets here.

206
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.000
How now, Simple! where have you been?

207
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.830
I must wait on myself, now must I?

208
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.200
You have not the Book of Riddles

209
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.630
about you, have you?

210
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.600
Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it

211
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.030
to Alice Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last,

212
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.470
a fortnight afore Michaelmas?

213
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:37.900
Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you.

214
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.870
A word with you, coz;

215
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.670
marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere,

216
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.430
a tender, a kind of tender,

217
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.100
made afar off by Sir Hugh here.

218
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.300
Do you understand me?

219
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.100
Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable;

220
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.030
if it be so, I shall do that that is reason.

221
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.430
Nay, but understand me.

222
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:58.670
So I do, sir.

223
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.530
Give ear to his motions, Master Slender:

224
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.500
I will description the matter to you,

225
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.930
if you be capacity of it.

226
00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.900
Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says:

227
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.070
I pray you, pardon me sir;

228
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.570
he's a justice of peace in his country,

229
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.300
simple though I stand here.

230
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.900
But that is not the question:

231
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.900
the question is concerning your marriage.

232
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.000
Ay, there's the point, sir.

233
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.400
Marry, is it; the very point of it;

234
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.930
to Mistress Anne Page.

235
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.800
Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?

236
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:32.630
Can you, carry her, your desires towards her?

237
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.430
I hope, sir,

238
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.800
I will do

239
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.370
as it shall become one that would do reason.

240
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.000
Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz:

241
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.400
what I do is to pleasure you, coz.

242
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.230
Can you love the maid?

243
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.700
I will marry her, sir, at your request:

244
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.100
but if there be no great love in the beginning,

245
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.000
yet heaven may decrease it

246
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.030
upon better acquaintance,

247
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.900
when we are married and have more occasion

248
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.530
to know one another;

249
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.430
I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt:

250
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.400
but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her;

251
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.870
that I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.

252
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.770
It is a fery discretion answer;

253
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.930
save the fall is in the word 'dissolutely:'

254
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.900
the word is, according to our meaning,

255
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.570
'resolutely:' his meaning is good.

256
00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.130
Ay, I think my cousin meant well.

257
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.170
Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!

258
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.200
Here comes fair Mistress Anne.

259
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.370
Mistress Anne! Would I were young for your sake.

260
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.030
The dinner is on the table;

261
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.100
my father desires your worships' company.

262
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.570
I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.

263
00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:45.470
Od's plessed will!

264
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:49.130
I will not be absence at the grace.

265
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.230
Will't please your worship to come in, sir?

266
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.400
No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily;

267
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.870
I am very well.

268
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.630
The dinner attends you, sir.

269
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.800
I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth.

270
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.430
Go, sirrah, for all you are my man,

271
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:09.830
go wait upon my cousin Shallow.

272
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.670
A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding

273
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.000
to his friend for a man.

274
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.270
I keep but three men and a boy yet,

275
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.200
till my mother be dead: but what though?

276
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.700
Yet I live like a poor gentleman born.

277
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.830
I may not go in without your worship:

278
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.230
they will not sit till you come.

279
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.230
I' faith, I'll eat nothing;

280
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.170
I thank you as much as though I did.

281
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.730
I pray you, sir, walk in.

282
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.300
I had rather walk here, I thank you.

283
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.370
I bruised my shin th' other day with playing

284
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.570
at sword and dagger with a master of fence;

285
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.300
three veneys for a dish of stewed prunes;

286
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:49.170
and, by my troth, I cannot abide the smell of hot meat since.

287
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:55.930
Why do your dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?

288
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.230
I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.

289
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.670
I love the sport well

290
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.600
but I shall as soon quarrel

291
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.600
at it as any man in England.

292
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.200
You are afraid, if you see the bear loose,

293
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:05.970
are you not?

294
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.600
Ay, indeed, sir.

295
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.800
That's meat and drink to me, now.

296
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.970
I have seen Sackerson loose twenty times,

297
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:13.870
and have taken him by the chain;

298
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.830
but, I warrant you,

299
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.070
the women have so cried and shrieked at it,

300
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.200
that it passed:

301
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.300
but women, indeed, cannot abide 'em;

302
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.070
they are very ill-favored rough things.

303
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.400
Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.

304
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.270
I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.

305
00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.700
By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir!

306
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:32.570
come, come.

307
00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:33.830
Nay, pray you, lead the way.

308
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:35.370
Come on, sir.

309
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.830
Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.

310
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.300
Not I, sir; pray you, keep on.

311
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.130
No, I will not. I will not go first.

312
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.870
Truly, indeed, I will not do you that wrong.

313
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.930
I pray you sir!

314
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.830
I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome.

315
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.100
You do yourself wrong, indeed you do!

316
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:30.000
Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius' house

317
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.230
which is the way:

318
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.470
and there dwells one Mistress Quickly,

319
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.870
which is in the manner of his nurse,

320
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.270
or his dry nurse, or his cook,

321
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.600
or his laundry, his washer, and his wringer.

322
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.600
Well, sir.

323
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.770
Nay, it is petter yet.

324
00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.470
Give her this letter;

325
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.430
for it is a 'oman that altogether's acquaintance

326
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:51.900
with Mistress Anne Page:

327
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.630
and the letter is, to desire

328
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:59.030
and require her to solicit your master's desires

329
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.170
to Mistress Anne.

330
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.830
I pray you, be gone:

331
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.330
I will make an end of my dinner;

332
00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.430
there's pippins and cheese to come.

333
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.530
Mine host of the Garter!

334
00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.770
What says my bully-rook?

335
00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:39.600
speak scholarly and wisely.

336
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.900
Truly, good mine host, I must turn away

337
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.830
some of my followers.

338
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.870
Discard, bully Hercules; cashier:

339
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:51.630
let them wag; trot, trot.

340
00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.130
I sit at ten pounds a week.

341
00:16:54.130 --> 00:17:00.430
Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar, Keisar, and Pheezar.

342
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.530
I will entertain Bardolph;

343
00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.730
he shall draw, he shall tap:

344
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.630
said I well, bully Hector?

345
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.730
Do so, good mine host.

346
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:17.930
I have spoke; let him follow.

347
00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.270
Let me see thee froth and lime:

348
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:25.000
I am at a word; follow.

349
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.570
Bardolph, follow him.

350
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.800
A tapster is a good trade:

351
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.470
an old cloak makes a new jerkin;

352
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:40.100
a withered serving-man a fresh tapster.

353
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.500
Go; adieu.

354
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.170
It is a life that I have desired:

355
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.730
I will thrive.

356
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.530
O base Hungarian wight!

357
00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.870
Wilt thou the spigot wield?

358
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.530
He was gotten in drink:

359
00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.870
is not the humour conceited?

360
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.700
I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox:

361
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.130
his thefts were too open;

362
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.130
his filching was like an unskilful singer;

363
00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.130
he kept not time.

364
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.200
The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.

365
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:28.000
'Convey,' the wise it call.

366
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:32.130
'Steal!' foh! a fico for the phrase!

367
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.470
Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.

368
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.200
Why, then, let kibes ensue.

369
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.200
There is no remedy; I must cony-catch;

370
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.230
I must shift.

371
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.870
Young ravens must have food.

372
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:46.770
Which of you know Ford of this town?

373
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:52.100
I ken the wight: he is of substance good.

374
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:52.900
My honest lads,

375
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.830
I will tell you what I am about.

376
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.600
Two yards, and more.

377
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.770
No quips now, Pistol!

378
00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.300
Indeed, I am in the waist two yards about;

379
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.630
but I am now about no waste;

380
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:07.070
I am about thrift.

381
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:10.230
Briefly, I do mean

382
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:14.100
to make love to Ford's wife:

383
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.330
I spy entertainment in her;

384
00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.330
she discourses, she carves,

385
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.470
she gives the leer of invitation:

386
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.000
I can construe the action

387
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.100
of her familiar style;

388
00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.030
and the hardest voice of her behavior,

389
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.400
to be Englished rightly, is,

390
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.900
'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'

391
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.530
He hath studied her will,

392
00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:34.600
and translated her will,

393
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.370
out of honesty into English.

394
00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:39.670
The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?

395
00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.730
Now, the report goes

396
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.070
she has all the rule of her husband's purse:

397
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:48.400
he hath a legion of angels.

398
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.770
As many devils entertain;

399
00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.630
and 'To her, boy,' say I.

400
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:57.230
The humour rises; humour me the angels.

401
00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:02.500
I have writ me here a letter to her:

402
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.830
and here another to Page's wife,

403
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.570
who even now gave me good eyes too,

404
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.100
examined my parts

405
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.470
with most judicious oeillades;

406
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.970
sometimes the beam of her view gilded my foot,

407
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.770
sometimes my portly belly.

408
00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.400
Then did the sun on dunghill shine.

409
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.970
I thank thee for that humour.

410
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:26.670
O, she did so course o'er my exteriors

411
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.600
with such a greedy intention,

412
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.330
that the appetite of her eye did seem to

413
00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.730
scorch me up like a burning-glass!

414
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:37.570
she bears the purse too;

415
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.570
she is a region in Guiana,

416
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.570
all gold and bounty.

417
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.170
I will be cheater to them both,

418
00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.670
and they shall be exchequers to me;

419
00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.800
they shall be my East and West Indies,

420
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.530
and I will trade to them both.

421
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.270
Go bear thou this letter to Mistress Page;

422
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.130
and thou this to Mistress Ford:

423
00:20:55.130 --> 00:21:00.230
we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.

424
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:03.370
Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,

425
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.870
And by my side wear steel?

426
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.630
then, Lucifer take all!

427
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.370
I will run no base humour:

428
00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.200
here, take the humour-letter:

429
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.000
I will keep the havior of reputation.

430
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.330
Hold, sirrah,

431
00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.270
bear you these letters tightly;

432
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.500
Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.

433
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.170
Rogues, hence, avaunt!

434
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.330
vanish like hailstones, go;

435
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.030
Trudge, plod away o' the hoof;

436
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.900
seek shelter, pack!

437
00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.130
Falstaff will learn the humour of the age,

438
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:46.330
French thrift, you rogues; myself and skirted page.

439
00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.570
Let vultures gripe thy guts!

440
00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:58.100
for gourd and fullam holds,

441
00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.830
And high and low beguiles the rich and poor:

442
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.830
Tester I'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,

443
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.830
Base Phrygian Turk!

444
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:13.470
I have operations which be humours of revenge.

445
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.900
Wilt thou revenge?

446
00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.670
By welkin and her star!

447
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.430
With wit or steel?

448
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:23.700
With both the humours, I:

449
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.870
I will disclose the humour

450
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.230
of this love to Page.

451
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:31.900
And I to Ford shall eke unfold

452
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.870
How Falstaff, varlet vile,

453
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:38.700
His dove will prove, his gold will hold,

454
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.730
And his soft couch defile.

455
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.930
My humour shall not cool:

456
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:49.130
I will incense Page to deal with poison;

457
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:53.130
I will possess him with yellowness,

458
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.500
for the revolt of mine is dangerous:

459
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.500
that is my true humour.

460
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.370
Thou art the Mars of malecontents:

461
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:06.430
I second thee; troop on.

462
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:35.170
What, John Rugby! John? John, I say!

463
00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.170
I pray thee, go to the casement,

464
00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:38.730
and see if you can see my master,

465
00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.900
Master Doctor Caius, coming.

466
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:41.900
If he do, i' faith,

467
00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.470
and find any body in the house,

468
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:44.800
here will be an old abusing

469
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.070
of God's patience

470
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.370
and the king's English.

471
00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:48.230
I'll go watch.

472
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:49.900
Go; and we'll have a posset

473
00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.470
for't soon at night,

474
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:52.870
in faith, at the latter end

475
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:54.600
of a sea-coal fire.

476
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.370
An honest, willing, kind fellow,

477
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.370
as ever servant shall come in house withal,

478
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:04.770
and, I warrant you, no tell-tale

479
00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.270
nor no breed-bate:

480
00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:08.400
his worst fault is,

481
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.070
that he is given to prayer;

482
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.800
he is something peevish that way:

483
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.900
but nobody but has his fault;

484
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.800
but let that pass.

485
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.130
Peter Simple, you say your name is?

486
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.400
Ay, for fault of a better.

487
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.600
And Master Slender's your master?

488
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.570
Ay, forsooth.

489
00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:28.030
Does he not wear a great round beard,

490
00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.800
like a glover's paring-knife?

491
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.170
No, forsooth:

492
00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.100
he hath but a little wee face,

493
00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.600
with a little yellow beard,

494
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.130
a Cain-coloured beard.

495
00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.830
A softly-sprighted man, is he not?

496
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:41.230
Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man

497
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.430
of his hands as any is

498
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:45.170
between this and his head;

499
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.970
he hath fought with a warrener.

500
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:54.500
How say you? O, I should remember him:

501
00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.130
does he not hold up his head, as it were,

502
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.730
and strut in his gait?

503
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.400
Yes, indeed, does he.

504
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.730
Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune!

505
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.700
Tell Master Parson Evans I will do what I can

506
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:08.730
for your master:

507
00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.130
Anne is a good girl, and I wish--

508
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.270
Out, alas! here comes my master.

509
00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:14.870
We shall all be shent.

510
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.130
Run in here, good young man;

511
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:24.030
go into this closet: he will not stay long.

512
00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:29.000
What, John Rugby! John! what, John, I say!

513
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.200
Go, John, go inquire for my master;

514
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.600
I doubt he be not well, that he comes not home.

515
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:43.270
(Singing)

516
00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:47.770
Vat is you sing? I do not like des toys.

517
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.430
Pray you, go and vetch me in my closet

518
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:59.370
un boitier vert, a box, a green-a box:

519
00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:02.930
do intend vat I speak? a green-a box.

520
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:06.770
Ay, forsooth; I'll fetch it you.

521
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:12.770
I am glad he went not in himself:

522
00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:13.870
if he had found the young man,

523
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:15.370
he would have been horn-mad.

524
00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:19.130
Fe, fe, fe, fe! ma foi,

525
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:21.700
il fait fort chaud.

526
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:29.300
Je m'en vais a la cour--la grande affaire.

527
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.130
Is it this, sir?

528
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:38.400
Oui; mette le au mon pocket: depeche, quickly.

529
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.900
Vere is dat knave Rugby?

530
00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.830
What, John Rugby! John!

531
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:45.730
Here, sir!

532
00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:50.130
You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby.

533
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.230
Come, take-a your rapier,

534
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:52.870
and come after my heel to the court.

535
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:54.430
'Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.

536
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:59.370
By my trot, I tarry too long. Od's me!

537
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:01.800
Qu'ai-j'oublie!

538
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.130

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:05.300

540
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.600
I shall leave behind.

541
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.000
Ay me, he'll find the young man here,

542
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.300
and be mad!

543
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:16.330
O diable, diable! vat is in my closet?

544
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.070
Villain! larron!

545
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.430
Rugby, my rapier!

546
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:23.230
Good master, be content.

547
00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:25.570
Wherefore shall I be content-a?

548
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:26.800
The young man is an honest man.

549
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.870
What shall de honest man do in my closet?

550
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:29.900
dere is no honest man

551
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.930
dat shall come in my closet.

552
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.800
I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic.

553
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.070
Hear the truth of it:

554
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.900
he came of an errand to me

555
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.170
from Parson Hugh.

556
00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:39.870
Vell.

557
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:41.100
to desire her to--

558
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.670
Peace-a your tongue.

559
00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.100
Speak-a your tale.

560
00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.730
To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid,

561
00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.670
to speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page

562
00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:51.730
for my master in the way of marriage.

563
00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:54.170
This is all, indeed, la!

564
00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.230
but I'll ne'er put my finger in the fire,

565
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:59.800
and need not.

566
00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:07.800
Sir Hugh send-a you? Rugby, baille me some paper.

567
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.100
Tarry you a little-a while.

568
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.230
I am glad he is so quiet:

569
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:17.300
if he had been thoroughly moved,

570
00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.330
you should have heard him

571
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.630
so loud and so melancholy.

572
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.170
But notwithstanding, man,

573
00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:24.870
I'll do you your master what good I can:

574
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.070
and the very yea and the no is,

575
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.670
the French doctor, my master,

576
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.470
--I may call him my master, look you,

577
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:34.130
for I keep his house;

578
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:35.930
and I wash, wring, brew, bake,

579
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:37.430
scour, dress meat and drink,

580
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:39.800
make the beds and do all myself,--

581
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.030
'Tis a great charge to come under one body's hand.

582
00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:45.270
Are you avised o' that?

583
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.130
you shall find it a great charge:

584
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:48.800
and to be up early and down late;

585
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.600
but notwithstanding,

586
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.500
--to tell you in your ear;

587
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.030
I would have no words of it,

588
00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:58.400
--my master himself is in love

589
00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:04.270
with Mistress Anne Page:

590
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.800
but notwithstanding that,

591
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.670
I know Anne's mind,--

592
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.300
that's neither here nor there.

593
00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:16.330
You jack'nape,

594
00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.300
give-a this letter to Sir Hugh;

595
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.430
by gar, it is a shallenge:

596
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:24.230
I will cut his troat in dee park;

597
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:25.270
and I will teach

598
00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:27.800
a scurvy jack-a-nape priest

599
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.800
to meddle or make.

600
00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.970
You may be gone;

601
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:33.900
it is not good you tarry here.

602
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:41.000
By gar, I will cut all his two stones;

603
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.130
he shall not have a stone to throw at his dog:

604
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.970
Alas, he speaks but for his friend.

605
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:54.470
It is no matter-a ver dat:

606
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:55.370
do not you tell-a me

607
00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:57.130
dat I shall have Anne Page for myself?

608
00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.900
By gar, I vill kill de Jack priest;

609
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.370
and I have appointed mine host of de Jarteer

610
00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:07.330
to measure our weapon.

611
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:11.800
By gar, I will myself have Anne Page.

612
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.930
Sir, the maid loves you,

613
00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.870
and all shall be well.

614
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.470
We must give folks leave to prate:

615
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:18.370
what, the good-jer!

616
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:22.200
Rugby, come to the court with me.

617
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:26.370
By gar, if I have not Anne Page,

618
00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:30.330
I shall turn your head out of my door.

619
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.830
Follow my heels, Rugby.

620
00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:40.630
You shall have An fool's-head of your own.

621
00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:46.400
No, I know Anne's mind for that:

622
00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.630
never a woman in Windsor

623
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:50.670
knows more of Anne's mind than I do;

624
00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:52.400
nor can do more than I do with her,

625
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.830
I thank heaven.

626
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:55.570
(from outside) Who's within there? ho!

627
00:30:55.570 --> 00:31:06.200
Who's there, I trow! Come near the house, I pray you.

628
00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.170
How now, good woman? how dost thou?

629
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:12.030
The better that it pleases your good worship to ask.

630
00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:16.500
What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne?

631
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.870
In truth, sir, and she is pretty,

632
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:21.670
and honest, and gentle;

633
00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:22.970
and one that is your friend,

634
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:24.800
I can tell you that by the way;

635
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.470
I praise heaven for it.

636
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:28.330
Shall I do any good, thinkest thou?

637
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:29.830
shall I not lose my suit?

638
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:33.770
Troth, sir, all is in his hands above:

639
00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:34.700
but notwithstanding, Master Fenton,

640
00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.770
I'll be sworn on a book, she loves you.

641
00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:42.670
Have not your worship a wart above your eye?

642
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.330
Yes, marry, have I; what of that?

643
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:48.670
Well, thereby hangs a tale:

644
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:51.170
good faith, it is such another Nan;

645
00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.300
but, I detest, an honest maid

646
00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.870
as ever broke bread:

647
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:58.870
we had an hour's talk of that wart.

648
00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:00.700
I shall never laugh

649
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.170
but in that maid's company!

650
00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:05.070
But indeed she is given too much

651
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:07.800
to allicholy and musing:

652
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.430
but for you--well, go to.

653
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:14.000
Well, I shall see her to-day.

654
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.270
Hold, there's money for thee;

655
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:21.100
let me have thy voice in my behalf:

656
00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:26.470
if thou seest her before me, commend me.

657
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:30.100
Will I? i'faith, that we will;

658
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.300
and I will tell your worship

659
00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:36.300
more of the wart the next time we have confidence;

660
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.600
and of other wooers.

661
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:43.330
Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.

662
00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:48.700
Farewell to your worship.

663
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:59.600
Truly, an honest gentleman:

664
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.270
but Anne loves him not;

665
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.600
for I know Anne's mind

666
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.770
as well as another does.

667
00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:09.300
(sniffing)

668
00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.970
Out upon't! what have I forgot?

669
00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.000
What, have I scaped love-letters

670
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.500
in the holiday- time of my beauty,

671
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.730
and am I now a subject for them?

672
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.500
Let me see.

673
00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.400
'Ask me no reason why I love you;

674
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.370
for though Love use Reason for his physician,

675
00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:43.670
he admits him not for his counsellor.

676
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:47.300
You are not young, no more am I;

677
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.430
go to then, there's sympathy:

678
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:53.770
you are merry, so am I; ha, ha!

679
00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:57.470
then there's more sympathy: you love sack,

680
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.130
and so do I;

681
00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.600
would you desire better sympathy?

682
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.400
Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,

683
00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.830
--at the least, if the love of soldier

684
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.770
can suffice,-- that I love thee.

685
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:11.430
I will not say, pity me;

686
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:13.200
'tis not a soldier-like phrase:

687
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.470
but I say, love me.

688
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:18.670
By me, Thine own true knight,

689
00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:20.100
By day or night,

690
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.830
Or any kind of light,

691
00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:23.700
With all his might

692
00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:28.330
For thee to fight, JOHN FALSTAFF'

693
00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:32.070
What a Herod of Jewry is this!

694
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:36.770
O wicked world!

695
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:39.300
One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with age

696
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.030
to show himself a young gallant!

697
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:44.100
What an unweighed behavior

698
00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:45.630
hath this Flemish drunkard picked

699
00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:46.300
--with the devil's name!

700
00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.230
--out of my conversation,

701
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:50.300
that he dares in this manner assay me?

702
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.000
Why, he hath not been thrice in my company!

703
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.570
What should I say to him?

704
00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:56.870
I was then frugal of my mirth:

705
00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:58.730
Heaven forgive me!

706
00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:01.170
Why, I'll exhibit a bill

707
00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:05.030
in the parliament for the putting down of men.

708
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:07.800
How shall I be revenged on him?

709
00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.730
for revenged I will be,

710
00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:12.500
as sure as his guts are made of puddings.

711
00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:16.600
Mistress Page! trust me,

712
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.330
I was going to your house.

713
00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:19.400
And, trust me, I was coming to you.

714
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.370
You look very ill.

715
00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:24.130
Nay, I'll ne'er believe that;

716
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:25.670
I have to show to the contrary.

717
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:27.000
Faith, but you do, in my mind.

718
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.270
Well, I do then; yet I say

719
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:31.070
I could show you to the contrary.

720
00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:35.100
O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!

721
00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.470
What's the matter, woman?

722
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.170
O woman, if it were not

723
00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:41.270
for one trifling respect,

724
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.070
I could come to such honour!

725
00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.200
Hang the trifle, woman!

726
00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.100
take the honour. What is it?

727
00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.930
dispense with trifles; what is it?

728
00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:49.970
If I would but go to hell

729
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:52.500
for an eternal moment or so,

730
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.930
I could be knighted.

731
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:58.530
What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford!

732
00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:00.070
These knights will hack;

733
00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:02.670
and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry.

734
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:09.000
We burn daylight: here, read, read;

735
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.900
perceive how I might be knighted.

736
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.600
I shall think the worse of fat men,

737
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.900
as long as I have an eye to make difference

738
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.970
of men's liking:

739
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:19.870
and yet he would not swear;

740
00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:21.570
praised women's modesty;

741
00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:22.600
and gave such orderly

742
00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.130
and well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness,

743
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:26.500
that I would have sworn his disposition

744
00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.300
would have gone to the truth of his words;

745
00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.970
but they do no more adhere

746
00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:31.170
and keep place together

747
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:32.270
than the Hundredth Psalm

748
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:35.000
to the tune of 'Green Sleeves.'

749
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.870
What tempest, I trow,

750
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:38.000
threw this whale,

751
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.230
with so many tuns of oil in his belly,

752
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:42.000
ashore at Windsor?

753
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.970
How shall I be revenged on him?

754
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:47.770
I think the best way were to entertain him with hope,

755
00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.030
till the wicked fire of lust

756
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:51.530
have melted him in his own grease.

757
00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.600
Did you ever hear the like?

758
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.530
Letter for letter,

759
00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:59.530
but that the name of Page and Ford differs!

760
00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:01.730
To thy great comfort in this mystery

761
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:03.430
of ill opinions,

762
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:06.730
here's the twin-brother of thy letter:

763
00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:07.930
but let thine inherit first;

764
00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.000
for, I protest, mine never shall.

765
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.730
I warrant he hath a thousand of these letters,

766
00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:13.370
writ with blank space for different names

767
00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:14.330
--sure, more,

768
00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:15.830
--and these are of the second edition:

769
00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:17.800
he will print them, out of doubt;

770
00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.130
for he cares not what he puts into the press,

771
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:21.270
when he would put us two.

772
00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:23.430
I had rather be a giantess,

773
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:26.030
and lie under Mount Pelion.

774
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:30.230
Well, I will find you twenty lascivious turtles

775
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:31.730
ere one chaste man.

776
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.870
Why, this is the very same; the very hand,

777
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:36.270
the very words. What doth he think of us?

778
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:37.400
Nay, I know not:

779
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.470
it makes me almost ready to

780
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:39.870
wrangle with mine own honesty.

781
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.200
I'll entertain myself like one

782
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.530
that I am not acquainted withal;

783
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:45.500
for, sure, unless he know some strain in me,

784
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.100
that I know not myself,

785
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.530
he would never have boarded me in this fury.

786
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:50.800
'Boarding,' call you it?

787
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.930
I'll be sure to keep him above deck.

788
00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:54.730
So will I if he come under my hatches,

789
00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:56.470
I'll never to sea again.

790
00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.670
Let's be revenged on him:

791
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.670
let's appoint him a meeting;

792
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:05.970
give him a show of comfort in his suit

793
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:08.230
and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,

794
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:09.630
till he hath pawned his horses

795
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:11.370
to mine host of the Garter.

796
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:13.870
Nay, I will consent

797
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.070
to act any villany against him,

798
00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:17.130
that may not sully

799
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.930
the chariness of our honesty.

800
00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:20.600
O, that my husband saw this letter!

801
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:24.070
it would give eternal food to his jealousy.

802
00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:24.630
Why, look where he comes;

803
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:28.300
and my good man with him

804
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:34.470
he's as far from jealousy

805
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:37.270
as I am from giving him cause;

806
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:40.600
and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.

807
00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.870
You are the happier woman.

808
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:46.600
Let's consult together against this greasy knight.

809
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.930
Come hither.

810
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:52.800
Well, I hope it be not so.

811
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.200
Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:

812
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.270
Sir John affects thy wife.

813
00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:00.200
Why, sir, my wife is not young.

814
00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.170
He wooes both high and low,

815
00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:03.330
both rich and poor,

816
00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:04.430
Both young and old,

817
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:06.600
one with another, Ford;

818
00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:07.700
He loves the gallimaufry:

819
00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.970
Ford, perpend.

820
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:11.500
Love my wife!

821
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:15.470
With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,

822
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:17.500
Like Sir Actaeon he,

823
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.200
with Ringwood at thy heels:

824
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.700
O, odious is the name!

825
00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.230
What name, sir?

826
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:29.030
The horn, I say. Farewell.

827
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.700
Take heed, have open eye,

828
00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.630
for thieves do foot by night:

829
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:35.370
Take heed, ere summer comes

830
00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:37.770
or cuckoo-birds do sing.

831
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.930
Away, Sir Corporal Nym!

832
00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:46.570
Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.

833
00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.370
I will be patient; I will find out this.

834
00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:53.530
And this is true;

835
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:56.130
I like not the humour of lying.

836
00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:59.130
He hath wronged me in some humours:

837
00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:00.030
I should have borne

838
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:02.170
the humoured letter to her;

839
00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:07.670
but I have a sword which can bite upon my necessity.

840
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:10.170
He loves your wife;

841
00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:16.670
there's the short and the long.

842
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:18.600
My name is Corporal Nym;

843
00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.100
I speak and I avouch;

844
00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:23.930
'tis true: my name is Nym

845
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:30.670
and Falstaff loves your wife.

846
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:37.230
Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and cheese,

847
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:42.400
and there's the humour of it. Adieu.

848
00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:48.500
'The humour of it,' quoth a'!

849
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:51.370
here's a fellow frights English out of his wits.

850
00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:53.530
I will seek out Falstaff.

851
00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:56.400
I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.

852
00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.230
If I do find it: well.

853
00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.400
I will not believe such a Cataian,

854
00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.500
though the priest o' the town

855
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.230
commended him for a true man.

856
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:09.430
'Twas a good sensible fellow: well.

857
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:11.170
How now, Meg!

858
00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:13.500
Whither go you, George? Hark you.

859
00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:17.530
How now, sweet Frank!

860
00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:18.570
why art thou melancholy?

861
00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:20.870
I melancholy! I am not melancholy.

862
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:22.370
Get you home, go.

863
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:26.330
Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head. Now,

864
00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:27.670
will you come, Mistress Page?

865
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:29.030
Have with you.

866
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:30.430
You'll come to dinner, George.

867
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:34.570
Look who comes yonder:

868
00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:35.530
she shall be our messenger

869
00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:36.570
to this paltry knight.

870
00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:38.100
Trust me, I thought on her:

871
00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.270
she'll fit it.

872
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:41.000
You are come to see my daughter Anne?

873
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.900
Ay, forsooth; and, I pray,

874
00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.100
how does good Mistress Anne?

875
00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.530
Go in with us and see:

876
00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:50.630
we have an hour's talk with you.

877
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:58.600
How now, Master Ford!

878
00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.870
You heard what this knave told me,

879
00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:01.100
did you not?

880
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:03.070
Yes: and you heard what the other told me?

881
00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:04.400
Do you think there is truth in them?

882
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.230
Hang 'em, slaves!

883
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:08.000
I do not think

884
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.830
the knight would offer it:

885
00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:12.400
but these that accuse him

886
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.030
in his intent towards our wives

887
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:16.400
are a yoke of his discarded men;

888
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.070
very rogues, now they be out of service.

889
00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:19.100
Were they his men?

890
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:20.170
Marry, were they.

891
00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.900
I like it never the better for that.

892
00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.800
Does he lie at the Garter?

893
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.630
Ay, marry, does he.

894
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:29.830
If he should intend this voyage towards my wife,

895
00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:33.100
I would turn her loose to him; and what he gets more of her

896
00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.230
than sharp words, let it lie on my head.

897
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:42.630
I do not misdoubt my wife;

898
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:43.570
but I would be loath

899
00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:45.700
to turn them together.

900
00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:47.830
A man may be too confident:

901
00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:49.730
I would have nothing lie on my head:

902
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:51.330
I cannot be thus satisfied.

903
00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:53.200
Look where my ranting host

904
00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.630
of the Garter comes:

905
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:55.800
there is either liquor in his pate

906
00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.700
or money in his purse

907
00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.170
when he looks so merrily.

908
00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:00.100
How now, mine host!

909
00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:05.300
How now, bully-rook! thou'rt a gentleman.

910
00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:08.600
Cavaleiro-justice, I say!

911
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.200
I follow, mine host, I follow.

912
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.370
Good morrow and twenty, good Master Page!

913
00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:16.630
Will you go with us? we have sport in hand.

914
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:18.300
Tell him, cavaleiro-justice;

915
00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.930
tell him, bully-rook.

916
00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.430
Sir, there is a fray to be fought

917
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:23.630
between Sir Hugh the Welsh priest

918
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:25.300
and Caius the French doctor.

919
00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.770
Good mine host o' the Garter,

920
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:29.830
a word with you.

921
00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:31.130
What sayest thou, my bully-rook?

922
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:33.000
Will you go with us to behold it?

923
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.470
My merry host hath had the measuring

924
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:35.600
of their weapons;

925
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.470
and, I think,

926
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:38.530
hath appointed them contrary places;

927
00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:39.470
for, believe me,

928
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:41.670
I hear the parson is no jester.

929
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:42.630
Hark, I will tell you

930
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:44.000
what our sport shall be.

931
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.330
Hast thou no suit against my knight,

932
00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:47.870
my guest-cavaleire?

933
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:50.030
None, I protest:

934
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:51.730
but I'll give you a pottle

935
00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:52.730
of burnt sack to give me

936
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:54.570
recourse to him and tell him

937
00:43:54.570 --> 00:44:00.070
my name is Brook; only for a jest.

938
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:02.700
My hand, bully;

939
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.630
thou shalt have egress and regress;

940
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:06.870
--said I well?

941
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:09.900
--and thy name shall be Brook.

942
00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:13.330
It is a merry knight.

943
00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:16.030
Will you go, An-heires?

944
00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:17.570
Have with you, mine host.

945
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:18.570
I have heard the Frenchman

946
00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:19.900
hath good skill in his rapier.

947
00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:23.430
Tut, sir, I could have told you more.

948
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:27.170
These days, you stand upon distance,

949
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:29.830
your passes, stoccadoes,

950
00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:33.100
and I know not what: 'tis the heart,

951
00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:37.470
Master Page; 'tis here, 'tis here.

952
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:38.670
I have seen the time,

953
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.230
with my long sword

954
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:44.400
I could have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.

955
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.570
Here, boys, here, here!

956
00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:48.670
shall we wag?

957
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:50.630
Have with you.

958
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:57.370
I would rather hear them scold than fight.

959
00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:59.800
Though Page be a secure fool,

960
00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.200
an stands so firmly

961
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.770
on his wife's frailty,

962
00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:04.130
yet I cannot put off

963
00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:06.100
my opinion so easily:

964
00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.470
she was in his company at Page's house;

965
00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:14.830
and what they made there, I know not.

966
00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:17.770
Well, I will look further into't:

967
00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:22.770
and I have a disguise to sound Falstaff.

968
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:24.030
If I find her honest,

969
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:26.300
I lose not my labour;

970
00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:29.300
if she be otherwise,

971
00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:33.470
'tis labour well bestowed.

972
00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:42.570
I will not lend thee a penny.

973
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:44.870
Why, then the world's mine oyster.

974
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:48.230
Which I with sword will open.

975
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:52.770
I will retort the sum in a quippage.

976
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:55.700
Not a penny. I have been content,

977
00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.730
sir, you should lay my countenance to pawn;

978
00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:00.270
I have grated upon my good friends

979
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:02.170
for three reprieves for you

980
00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:04.800
and your coach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked

981
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.200
through the grate, like a geminy of baboons.

982
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.300
I am damned in hell for swearing

983
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.130
to gentlemen my friends,

984
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:13.830
you were good soldiers and tall fellows;

985
00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:16.270
and when Mistress Bridget lost the handle

986
00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:19.370
of her fan, I took't upon mine honour

987
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:20.830
thou hadst it not.

988
00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:21.770
Didst not thou share?

989
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:24.400
hadst thou not fifteen pence?

990
00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:28.530
Reason, you rogue, reason:

991
00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:32.130
thinkest thou I'll endanger my soul gratis?

992
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:34.330
At a word, hang no more about me,

993
00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:36.330
I am no gibbet for you.

994
00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:38.630
Go. A short knife and a throng!

995
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:42.500
To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go.

996
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.870
You'll not bear a letter for me?

997
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:46.900
You stand upon your honour!

998
00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:50.370
Why, thou unconfinable baseness,

999
00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:51.670
it is as much as I can do

1000
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:54.430
to keep the terms of my honour precise:

1001
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:56.030
I, I,

1002
00:46:56.030 --> 00:47:02.630
I myself sometimes,

1003
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:04.100
leaving the fear of God

1004
00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:05.200
on the left hand

1005
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.670
and hiding mine honour

1006
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:08.330
in my necessity,

1007
00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:10.330
am fain to shuffle,

1008
00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:12.200
to hedge and to lurch;

1009
00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:16.300
and yet you, rogue,

1010
00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.370
will ensconce your rags,

1011
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:22.130
your cat-a-mountain looks,

1012
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:23.330
your red-lattice phrases,

1013
00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:24.830
and your bold-beating oaths,

1014
00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:27.900
under the shelter of your honour!

1015
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:30.100
You will not do it, you!

1016
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.230
I do relent: what would thou more of man?

1017
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:35.200
Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.

1018
00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:39.200
Let her approach.

1019
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.030
Give your worship good morrow.

1020
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:48.170
Good morrow, good wife.

1021
00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:50.870
Not so, an't please your worship.

1022
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:52.270
Good maid, then.

1023
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:53.570
I'll be sworn,

1024
00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:54.530
As my mother was,

1025
00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:56.600
the first hour I was born.

1026
00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.070
I do believe the swearer. What with me?

1027
00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:01.630
Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?

1028
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:03.200
Two thousand, fair woman:

1029
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.570
and I'll vouchsafe thee the hearing.

1030
00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:10.630
There is one Mistress Ford, sir:

1031
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:13.770
I pray, come a little nearer this ways:

1032
00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:17.170
I myself dwell with master Doctor Caius,

1033
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:19.430
Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,--

1034
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:22.470
Your worship says very true:

1035
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:23.270
I pray your worship,

1036
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:25.800
come a little nearer this ways.

1037
00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.030
I warrant thee, nobody hears;

1038
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:33.970
mine own people, mine own people.

1039
00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:36.670
Are they so? God bless them

1040
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:38.970
and make them his servants!

1041
00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:41.900
Well, Mistress Ford; what of her?

1042
00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.330
Why, sir, she's a good creature.

1043
00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:47.270
Lord Lord! your worship's a wanton!

1044
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:48.870
Well, heaven forgive you

1045
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:50.130
and all of us, I pray!

1046
00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:54.100
Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,--

1047
00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.030
Marry, this is the short

1048
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:58.730
and the long of it;

1049
00:48:58.730 --> 00:48:59.800
you have brought her

1050
00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:03.500
into such a canaries as 'tis wonderful.

1051
00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:04.830
The best courtier of them all,

1052
00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:06.230
when the court lay at Windsor,

1053
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:07.530
could never have brought her

1054
00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:09.200
to such a canary.

1055
00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.370
Yet there has been knights,

1056
00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:13.130
and lords, and gentlemen,

1057
00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:14.470
with their coaches,

1058
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:16.600
I warrant you, coach after coach,

1059
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:17.500
letter after letter,

1060
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:20.370
gift after gift; smelling so sweetly,

1061
00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:23.030
all musk, and so rushling, I warrant you,

1062
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:26.030
in silk and gold; and in such alligant terms;

1063
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:27.470
that would have won any woman's heart;

1064
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:28.430
and, I warrant you,

1065
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:30.900
they could never get an eye-wink of her:

1066
00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:35.000
I had myself twenty angels

1067
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.800
given me this morning;

1068
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.170
but I defy all angels,

1069
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:40.930
in any such sort, as they say,

1070
00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:43.170
but in the way of honesty:

1071
00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:44.600
and, I warrant you,

1072
00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.430
they could never get her so much

1073
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:49.000
as sip on a cup with the proudest

1074
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.030
of them all:

1075
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:52.670
and yet there has been earls,

1076
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:56.630
nay, which is more, pensioners;

1077
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:59.830
but, I warrant you, all is one with her.

1078
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:01.300
But what says she to me?

1079
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.870
be brief, my good she-Mercury.

1080
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:08.230
Marry, she hath received your letter,

1081
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:09.730
for the which she thanks you

1082
00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:11.300
a thousand times;

1083
00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.830
and she gives you to notify

1084
00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:15.570
that her husband will be absence

1085
00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:18.570
from his house between ten and eleven.

1086
00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:19.570
Ten and eleven?

1087
00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:21.770
Ay, forsooth;

1088
00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:23.370
and then you may come

1089
00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:25.970
and see the picture, she says,

1090
00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:28.300
that you wot of:

1091
00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.470
Master Ford, her husband,

1092
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:32.800
will be from home.

1093
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.000
Alas! the sweet woman

1094
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.170
leads an ill life with him:

1095
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:39.570
he's a very jealousy man:

1096
00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:41.200
she leads a very frampold life

1097
00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.600
with him, good heart.

1098
00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:45.400
Ten and eleven.

1099
00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.530
Woman, commend me to her;

1100
00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:49.070
I will not fail her.

1101
00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:50.530
Why, you say well.

1102
00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:52.630
But I have another messenger

1103
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:54.230
to your worship.

1104
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:55.430
Mistress Page hath her

1105
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:58.230
hearty commendations to you too:

1106
00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:06.270
and let me tell you in your ear,

1107
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:11.200
she's as fartuous a civil modest wife,

1108
00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.770
and one, that will not miss you

1109
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:14.100
morning nor evening prayer,

1110
00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.770
as any is in Windsor,

1111
00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:17.970
whoe'er be the other:

1112
00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:19.600
and she bade me tell your worship

1113
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.830
that her husband is seldom from home;

1114
00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:25.000
but she hopes there will come a time.

1115
00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:27.500
I never knew a woman so dote

1116
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.670
upon a man:

1117
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:31.600
surely I think you have charms,

1118
00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:35.300
la; yes, in truth.

1119
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:36.500
Not I, I assure thee:

1120
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:37.500
setting the attractions

1121
00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:38.600
of my good parts aside

1122
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.300
I have no other charms.

1123
00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.830
Blessing on your heart for't!

1124
00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:44.570
But, I pray thee, tell me this:

1125
00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:47.500
has Ford's wife and Page's wife

1126
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:50.670
acquainted each other how they love me?

1127
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:52.400
That were a jest indeed!

1128
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.600
they have not so little grace, I hope:

1129
00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.100
that were a trick indeed!

1130
00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.170
but Mistress Page would desire you

1131
00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:02.930
to send her your little page,

1132
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:05.670
of all loves:

1133
00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.900
her husband has a marvellous infection

1134
00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.600
to the little page;

1135
00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:15.030
and truly Master Page is an honest man.

1136
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:16.870
Never a wife in Windsor

1137
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:18.970
leads a better life than she does:

1138
00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:21.430
do what she will, say what she will,

1139
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:22.330
take all, pay all,

1140
00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:23.370
go to bed when she list,

1141
00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:24.370
rise when she list,

1142
00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:25.330
all is as she will:

1143
00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:27.130
and truly she deserves it;

1144
00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:28.600
for if there be a kind woman

1145
00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.430
in Windsor, she is one.

1146
00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:34.670
You must send her your page;

1147
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:36.270
no remedy.

1148
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:38.930
Why, I will.

1149
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:40.730
Nay, but do so,

1150
00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:42.600
and, look you,

1151
00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:45.730
he may come and go between you both;

1152
00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:48.370
and in any case have a nay-word,

1153
00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:50.600
that you may know one another's mind,

1154
00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:51.600
and the boy never need

1155
00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.230
to understand any thing;

1156
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:54.630
for 'tis not good that children

1157
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:57.170
should know any wickedness:

1158
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:59.970
old folks, you know, have discretion,

1159
00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:02.330
as they say, and know the world.

1160
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:05.830
Fare thee well:

1161
00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:08.630
woman, commend me to them both:

1162
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:12.570
there's my purse; I am yet thy debtor.

1163
00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:17.730
Boy, go along with this woman.

1164
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:32.070
This news distracts me!

1165
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:37.430
This punk is one of Cupid's carriers:

1166
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:40.230
Clap on more sails; pursue;

1167
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:41.830
up with your fights:

1168
00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:45.770
Give fire: she is my prize,

1169
00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:47.600
or ocean whelm them all!

1170
00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:55.070
Sayest thou so, old Jack?

1171
00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:56.000
go thy ways;

1172
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.430
I'll make more of thy old body

1173
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:59.330
than I have done.

1174
00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:02.270
Will they yet look after thee?

1175
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:04.470
Wilt thou, after the expense

1176
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:10.230
of so much money, be now a gainer?

1177
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:12.900
Good body, I thank thee.

1178
00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:15.530
Let them say 'tis grossly done;

1179
00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:19.030
so it be fairly done, no matter.

1180
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:25.470
Sir John, there's one Master Brook

1181
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:27.130
below would fain speak with you,

1182
00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:29.070
and be acquainted with you;

1183
00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:30.670
and hath sent your worship

1184
00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:33.000
a morning's draught of sack.

1185
00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.870
Brook is his name?

1186
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:36.370
Ay, sir.

1187
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:38.430
Call him in.

1188
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:39.800
Such Brooks are welcome

1189
00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.630
that o'erflow such liquor.

1190
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:43.930
Ah, ha!

1191
00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:52.830
Mistress Page and Mistress Ford

1192
00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:56.800
have I encompassed you? go to; via!

1193
00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:04.930
Bless you, sir!

1194
00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:07.700
And you, sir! Would you speak with me?

1195
00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:08.870
I make bold to press

1196
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:11.370
with so little preparation upon you.

1197
00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:13.430
You're welcome. What's your will?

1198
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:16.870
Give us leave, drawer.

1199
00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.870
Sir, I am a gentleman

1200
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:34.830
that have spent much;

1201
00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:36.200
my name is Brook.

1202
00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.330
Good Master Brook,

1203
00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:39.830
I desire more acquaintance of you.

1204
00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:42.670
Good Sir John, I sue for yours:

1205
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:43.970
not to charge you;

1206
00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:45.430
for I must let you understand

1207
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:46.930
I think myself in better plight

1208
00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:49.200
for a lender than you are:

1209
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.330
the which hath something embolden'd me

1210
00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:53.870
to this unseasoned intrusion;

1211
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:56.870
for they say, if money go before,

1212
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:58.800
all ways do lie open.

1213
00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:00.530
Money is a good soldier, sir,

1214
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:01.830
and will on.

1215
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:03.600
Troth, and I have a bag

1216
00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:06.470
of money here troubles me:

1217
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:08.900
if you will help to bear it, Sir John,

1218
00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:12.130
take all, or half, for easing me

1219
00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:13.600
of the carriage.

1220
00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.900
Master Brook, I know not how I may deserve

1221
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.270
to be your porter.

1222
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:18.300
I will tell you, sir,

1223
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:20.370
if you will give me the hearing.

1224
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:21.470
Speak, good Master Brook:

1225
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:23.470
I shall be glad to be your servant.

1226
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:26.070
Sir, I hear you are a scholar,

1227
00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:27.500
I will be brief with you,

1228
00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:30.530
and you have been a man long known to me,

1229
00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:31.830
though I had never so good means, as desire,

1230
00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:34.830
to make myself acquainted with you.

1231
00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:36.400
I shall discover a thing to you,

1232
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.500
wherein I must very much lay open

1233
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:41.400
mine own imperfection:

1234
00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:42.230
but, good Sir John,

1235
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:44.100
as you have one eye upon my follies,

1236
00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.670
as you hear them unfolded,

1237
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:47.130
turn another into the register

1238
00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:48.400
of your own;

1239
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.400
that I may pass

1240
00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:50.630
with a reproof the easier,

1241
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:52.600
sith you yourself know how easy

1242
00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.200
it is to be such an offender.

1243
00:56:55.770 --> 00:56:57.700
Very well, sir; proceed.

1244
00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:02.070
There is a gentlewoman in this town;

1245
00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:05.070
her husband's name is Ford.

1246
00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:08.730
Well, sir.

1247
00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:11.570
I have long loved her, and,

1248
00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:12.600
I protest to you,

1249
00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:14.500
bestowed much on her;

1250
00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:15.500
followed her

1251
00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:16.800
with a doting observance;

1252
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:19.300
engrossed opportunities to meet her;

1253
00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:20.500
fee'd every slight occasion

1254
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:21.530
that could but niggardly

1255
00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:22.870
give me sight of her;

1256
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:24.200
not only bought many presents

1257
00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:24.830
to give her,

1258
00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:26.000
but have given largely

1259
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:26.630
to many to know

1260
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:28.230
what she would have given;

1261
00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.830
briefly, I have pursued her

1262
00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:32.530
as love hath pursued me;

1263
00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:33.470
which hath been

1264
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:36.230
on the wing of all occasions.

1265
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:37.730
But whatsoever I have merited,

1266
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:38.800
either in my mind or,

1267
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.030
in my means, meed,

1268
00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:41.630
I am sure, I have received none;

1269
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:43.530
unless experience be a jewel

1270
00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:44.470
that I have purchased

1271
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:46.100
at an infinite rate,

1272
00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:48.530
and that hath taught me to say this:

1273
00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:51.030
'Love like a shadow flies

1274
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:53.700
when substance love pursues;

1275
00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:55.330
Pursuing that that flies,

1276
00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:57.670
and flying what pursues.'

1277
00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.500
Have you received no promise

1278
00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:01.900
of satisfaction at her hands?

1279
00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:02.830
Never.

1280
00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:04.630
Have you importuned her to such a purpose?

1281
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:05.470
Never.

1282
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:07.070
Of what quality was your love, then?

1283
00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:08.800
Like a fair house built

1284
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:10.400
on another man's ground;

1285
00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.230
so that I have lost my edifice

1286
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:13.270
by mistaking the place

1287
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:15.100
where I erected it.

1288
00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:19.970
To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?

1289
00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:21.030
When I have told you that,

1290
00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:22.470
I have told you all.

1291
00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:26.730
Some say, that though she appear

1292
00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:28.470
honest to me,

1293
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:29.670
yet in other places

1294
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:31.630
she enlargeth her mirth

1295
00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:32.470
so far that

1296
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:34.170
there is shrewd construction

1297
00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:35.670
made of her.

1298
00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:37.500
Now, Sir John,

1299
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:39.530
here is the heart of my purpose:

1300
00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:41.370
you are a gentleman

1301
00:58:41.370 --> 00:58:42.930
of excellent breeding,

1302
00:58:42.930 --> 00:58:44.370
admirable discourse,

1303
00:58:44.370 --> 00:58:46.030
of great admittance,

1304
00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:49.030
authentic in your place and person,

1305
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:49.870
generally allowed

1306
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:51.030
for your many war-like, court-like,

1307
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:53.130
and learned preparations.

1308
00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:54.200
O, sir!

1309
00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:57.270
Believe it, for you know it.

1310
00:58:57.270 --> 00:59:00.270
There is money;

1311
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:03.900
spend it,

1312
00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:08.100
spend it;

1313
00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:12.630
spend more;

1314
00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:17.070
spend all I have;

1315
00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:18.000
only give me so much

1316
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.970
of your time in exchange of it,

1317
00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:22.230
as to lay an amiable siege

1318
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:24.530
to the honesty of this Ford's wife:

1319
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:27.270
use your art of wooing;

1320
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:29.970
win her to consent to you:

1321
00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:32.530
if any man may, you may as soon as any.

1322
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:34.230
Would it apply well

1323
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:35.100
to the vehemency

1324
00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:36.230
of your affection,

1325
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:39.800
that I should win what you would enjoy?

1326
00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:40.770
Methinks you prescribe

1327
00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:42.600
to yourself very preposterously.

1328
00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.300
O, understand my drift.

1329
00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:46.030
She dwells so securely

1330
00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:47.900
on the excellency of her honour,

1331
00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:49.130
that the folly of my soul

1332
00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:50.800
dares not present itself:

1333
00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.030
she is too bright

1334
00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:54.130
to be looked against.

1335
00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:55.670
Now, could I could come to her

1336
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:57.370
with any detection in my hand,

1337
00:59:57.370 --> 00:59:58.800
my desires had instance

1338
00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.430
and argument to commend themselves:

1339
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:02.130
I could drive her then

1340
01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:03.670
from the ward of her purity,

1341
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:06.030
her reputation, her marriage-vow,

1342
01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:08.270
and a thousand other her defences,

1343
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:09.600
which now are too too strongly

1344
01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.700
embattled against me.

1345
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:17.400
What say you to't, Sir John?

1346
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:22.270
Master Brook,

1347
01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:23.800
I will first make bold

1348
01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:26.000
with your money;

1349
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.230
next, give me your hand;

1350
01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:32.530
and last, as I am a gentleman,

1351
01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:34.000
you shall, if you will,

1352
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.100
enjoy Ford's wife.

1353
01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:36.930
O good sir!

1354
01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:39.200
I say you shall.

1355
01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.700
Want no money, Sir John;

1356
01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.200
you shall want none.

1357
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.430
Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook;

1358
01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:46.400
you shall want none.

1359
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.930
I shall be with her,

1360
01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:53.070
I may tell you,

1361
01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:55.630
by her own appointment;

1362
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:56.870
even as you came in to me,

1363
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:59.330
her assistant or go-between parted from me:

1364
01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:00.970
I say I shall be with her

1365
01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:03.230
between ten and eleven;

1366
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:04.130
for at that time

1367
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:06.470
the jealous rascally knave her husband

1368
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:07.800
will be forth.

1369
01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:08.670
Come you to me at night;

1370
01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:10.030
you shall know how I speed.

1371
01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:12.070
I am blest in your acquaintance.

1372
01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:14.370
Do you know Ford, sir?

1373
01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:18.370
Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave!

1374
01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:19.170
I know him not:

1375
01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:21.100
yet I wrong him to call him poor;

1376
01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:22.970
they say the jealous wittolly knave

1377
01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:24.370
hath masses of money;

1378
01:01:24.370 --> 01:01:25.270
for the which his wife

1379
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:26.700
seems to me well-favored.

1380
01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.870
I will use her as the key

1381
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:30.200
of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;

1382
01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.800
and there's my harvest-home.

1383
01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.730
I would you knew Ford, sir,

1384
01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:34.870
that you might avoid him

1385
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:36.630
if you saw him.

1386
01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:43.000
Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue!

1387
01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:45.200
I will stare him out of his wits;

1388
01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.770
I will awe him with my cudgel:

1389
01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.330
it shall hang like a meteor

1390
01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:51.530
o'er the cuckold's horns.

1391
01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.530
Master Brook, thou shalt know

1392
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:55.430
I will predominate over the peasant,

1393
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:58.300
and thou shalt lie with his wife.

1394
01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.130
Come to me soon at night.

1395
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.970
Ford's a knave,

1396
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:07.800
and I will aggravate his style;

1397
01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:13.530
and shalt know him for knave and cuckold.

1398
01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:16.070
Come to me soon at night.

1399
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:23.170
What a damned Epicurean rascal is this!

1400
01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:27.400
My heart is ready to crack with impatience.

1401
01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.500
Who says this is improvident jealousy?

1402
01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.530
my wife hath sent to him;

1403
01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:34.500
the hour is fixed; the match is made.

1404
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.770
Would any man have thought this?

1405
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:40.700
See the hell of having a false woman!

1406
01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:42.270
My bed shall be abused,

1407
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:44.170
my coffers ransacked,

1408
01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:45.700
my reputation gnawn at;

1409
01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:46.470
and I shall not only

1410
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:48.170
receive this villanous wrong,

1411
01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:49.270
but stand under the adoption

1412
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:50.470
of abominable terms,

1413
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:53.400
and by him that does me this wrong.

1414
01:02:56.870 --> 01:03:02.100
Terms! names! Amaimon sounds well;

1415
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:05.500
Lucifer, well; Barbason, well;

1416
01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:08.370
yet they are devils' additions,

1417
01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:09.770
the names of fiends:

1418
01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:16.830
but Cuckold! Wittol!

1419
01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:20.730
Cuckold! the devil himself

1420
01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.130
hath not such a name.

1421
01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:25.200
Page is an ass, a secure ass:

1422
01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.370
he will trust his wife;

1423
01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:27.830
he will not be jealous.

1424
01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:29.270
I will rather trust a Fleming

1425
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:30.130
with my butter,

1426
01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:32.330
Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese,

1427
01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:35.030
an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle,

1428
01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:37.570
or a thief to walk my ambling gelding,

1429
01:03:37.570 --> 01:03:41.270
than my wife with herself;

1430
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:42.030
then she plots,

1431
01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:43.170
then she ruminates,

1432
01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:44.300
then she devises;

1433
01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.370
and what they think in their hearts

1434
01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:46.200
they may effect,

1435
01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.530
they will break their hearts

1436
01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:50.470
but they will effect.

1437
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:53.330
God be praised for my jealousy!

1438
01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:54.870
Eleven o'clock the hour.

1439
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:56.900
I will prevent this, detect my wife,

1440
01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.230
be revenged on Falstaff,

1441
01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:00.070
and laugh at Page.

1442
01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:00.870
I will about it;

1443
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:01.970
better three hours too soon

1444
01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:04.330
than a minute too late.

1445
01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:07.700
Fie, fie, fie!

1446
01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:22.300
cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!

1447
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:32.230
(grunting)

1448
01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:40.470
Jack Rugby!

1449
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:42.000
Sir?

1450
01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.130
Vat is de clock, Jack?

1451
01:04:48.130 --> 01:04:49.570
'Tis past the hour, sir,

1452
01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:51.470
that Sir Hugh promised to meet.

1453
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:54.070

01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:04.330
'Pless you from his mercy sake, all of you!

1636
01:13:04.330 --> 01:13:08.500
What, the sword and the word!

1637
01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:10.730
do you study them both, master parson?

1638
01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:12.730
And youthful still! in your doublet

1639
01:13:12.730 --> 01:13:15.470
and hose this raw rheumatic day!

1640
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:19.700
There is reasons and causes for it.

1641
01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:22.400
We are come to you to do a good office,

1642
01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.570
master parson.

1643
01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:27.400
Fery well: what is it?

1644
01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.230
Yonder is a most reverend gentleman,

1645
01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:30.800
who, belike having received wrong

1646
01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:31.800
by some person,

1647
01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.600
is at most odds with his own gravity

1648
01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:37.770
and patience that ever you saw.

1649
01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:41.400
I have lived fourscore years and upward;

1650
01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.200
I never heard a man of his place,

1651
01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.570
gravity and learning,

1652
01:13:44.570 --> 01:13:47.330
so wide of his own respect.

1653
01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:48.470
What is he?

1654
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:50.930
I think you know him; Master Doctor Caius,

1655
01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:52.270
the renowned French physician.

1656
01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:54.630
Got's will, and his passion

1657
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:55.370
of my heart!

1658
01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:56.170
I had as lief you would tell me

1659
01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:58.130
of a mess of porridge.

1660
01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:59.230
Why?

1661
01:13:59.230 --> 01:14:00.500
He has no more knowledge

1662
01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.300
in Hibocrates and Galen,

1663
01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:03.730
--and he is a knave besides;

1664
01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:04.970
a cowardly knave

1665
01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:05.900
as you would desires

1666
01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:07.530
to be acquainted withal.

1667
01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:09.030
I warrant you,

1668
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:11.000
here's the man should fight with him.

1669
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.430
O sweet Anne Page!

1670
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:14.570
It appears so by his weapons.

1671
01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:20.700
Keep them asunder: here comes Doctor Caius!

1672
01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:29.530
Nay, good master parson, keep in your weapon.

1673
01:14:29.530 --> 01:14:31.770
So do you, good master doctor.

1674
01:14:31.770 --> 01:14:33.230
Disarm them, and let them question:

1675
01:14:33.230 --> 01:14:34.470
let them keep their limbs whole

1676
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:37.270
and hack our English.

1677
01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:49.030
I pray you, let-a me speak a word

1678
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:50.530
with your ear.

1679
01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:52.770
Vherefore vill you not meet-a me?

1680
01:14:52.770 --> 01:14:55.270
Pray you, use your patience:

1681
01:14:57.130 --> 01:14:58.870
in good time.

1682
01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:01.100
By gar, you are de coward,

1683
01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:04.400
de Jack dog, John ape.

1684
01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.430
Pray you let us not be

1685
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:07.930
laughing-stocks to other men's humours;

1686
01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:10.030
I desire you in friendship,

1687
01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:11.100
and I will one way or other

1688
01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:12.700
make you amends.

1689
01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:15.830
I will knog your urinals

1690
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:17.170
about your knave's cockscomb

1691
01:15:17.170 --> 01:15:18.900
for missing your meetings and appointments.

1692
01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:21.630
Diable! Jack Rugby,

1693
01:15:21.630 --> 01:15:22.700
--mine host de Jarteer,

1694
01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:23.970
have I not stay for him to kill him?

1695
01:15:23.970 --> 01:15:25.000
have I not,

1696
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:25.970
at de place I did appoint?

1697
01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:27.270
As I am a Christians soul now, look you,

1698
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:29.030
this is the place appointed:

1699
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:30.730
I'll be judgement by mine host

1700
01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:31.800
of the Garter.

1701
01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.000
Peace, I say, Gallia and Gaul,

1702
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.670
French and Welsh,

1703
01:15:35.670 --> 01:15:38.330
soul-curer and body-curer!

1704
01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:40.230
Ay, dat is very good; excellent.

1705
01:15:40.230 --> 01:15:42.430
Peace, I say! hear mine host

1706
01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:43.670
of the Garter.

1707
01:15:43.670 --> 01:15:46.570
Am I politic? am I subtle?

1708
01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:48.470
am I a Machiavel?

1709
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:51.530
Shall I lose my doctor?

1710
01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:53.170
no; he gives me the potions

1711
01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:54.700
and the motions.

1712
01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:58.070
Shall I lose my parson, my priest,

1713
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:59.000
my Sir Hugh?

1714
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.100
no; he gives me the proverbs

1715
01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:03.000
and the no-verbs.

1716
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:10.030
Give me thy hand, terrestrial; so.

1717
01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:16.530
Give me thy hand, celestial; so.

1718
01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:20.870
Boys of art, I have deceived you both;

1719
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:24.300
I have directed you to wrong places:

1720
01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:26.530
your hearts are mighty,

1721
01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:27.830
your skins are whole,

1722
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:31.070
and let burnt sack be the issue.

1723
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:34.830
Come, lay their swords to pawn.

1724
01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:38.070
Follow me, lads of peace;

1725
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:39.170
follow, follow, follow.

1726
01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:44.570
Trust me, a mad host. Follow, gentlemen, follow.

1727
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:46.870
O sweet Anne Page!

1728
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:51.200
Ha, do I perceive dat?

1729
01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.100
have you make-a de sot of us,

1730
01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:54.800
ha, ha?

1731
01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:57.400
This is well;

1732
01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.670
he has made us his vlouting-stog.

1733
01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:02.700
I desire you that we may be friends;

1734
01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:05.330
and let us knog our prains together

1735
01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:07.070
to be revenge on this same scall,

1736
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:08.900
scurvy cogging companion,

1737
01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:10.300
the host of the Garter.

1738
01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:12.400
By gar, with all my heart.

1739
01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.200
He promise to bring me

1740
01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.630
where is Anne Page; by gar,

1741
01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:16.830
he deceive me too.

1742
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:20.830
Well, I will smite his noddles.

1743
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:22.670
Pray you, follow.

1744
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:36.100
(music)

1745
01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:50.530
(music)

1746
01:17:50.530 --> 01:17:52.200
Nay, keep your way, little gallant;

1747
01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.570
you were wont to be a follower,

1748
01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:55.800
but now you are a leader.

1749
01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:57.970
Whether had you rather lead mine eyes,

1750
01:17:57.970 --> 01:17:59.400
or eye your master's heels?

1751
01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.670
I had rather, forsooth,

1752
01:18:00.670 --> 01:18:02.200
go before you like a man

1753
01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:03.870
than follow him like a dwarf.

1754
01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:06.470
O, you are a flattering boy:

1755
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:08.470
now I see you'll be a courtier.

1756
01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:14.470
Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?

1757
01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:15.730
Truly, sir, to see your wife.

1758
01:18:15.730 --> 01:18:17.170
Is she at home?

1759
01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:18.130
Ay; and as idle as she

1760
01:18:18.130 --> 01:18:20.530
may hang together, for want of company.

1761
01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:21.800
I think, if your husbands were dead,

1762
01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.370
you two would marry.

1763
01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:26.100
Be sure of that,--two other husbands.

1764
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:29.770
Where had you this pretty weather-cock?

1765
01:18:29.770 --> 01:18:30.970
I cannot tell

1766
01:18:30.970 --> 01:18:32.370
what the dickens his name is

1767
01:18:32.370 --> 01:18:34.730
my husband had him of.

1768
01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:36.200
What do you call your knight's name, sirrah?

1769
01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.770
Sir John Falstaff.

1770
01:18:37.770 --> 01:18:41.430
Sir John Falstaff!

1771
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:44.230
He, he; I can never hit on's name.

1772
01:18:44.230 --> 01:18:45.670
There is such a league

1773
01:18:45.670 --> 01:18:47.100
between my good man and he!

1774
01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.400
Is your wife at home indeed?

1775
01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:49.630
Indeed she is.

1776
01:18:49.630 --> 01:18:51.130
By your leave, sir:

1777
01:18:51.130 --> 01:18:53.130
I am sick till I see her.

1778
01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:57.670
Has Page any brains?

1779
01:18:57.670 --> 01:18:58.970
hath he any eyes?

1780
01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:00.300
hath he any thinking?

1781
01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:01.230
Sure, they sleep;

1782
01:19:01.230 --> 01:19:02.830
he hath no use of them.

1783
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:06.170
Why, this boy will carry

1784
01:19:06.170 --> 01:19:07.630
a letter twenty mile,

1785
01:19:07.630 --> 01:19:09.370
as easy as a cannon

1786
01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:11.530
will shoot point-blank twelve score.

1787
01:19:11.530 --> 01:19:13.800
He pieces out his wife's inclination;

1788
01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.670
he gives her folly motion and advantage:

1789
01:19:15.670 --> 01:19:17.430
and now she's going to my wife,

1790
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:19.470
and Falstaff's boy with her.

1791
01:19:19.470 --> 01:19:20.530
A man may hear this shower

1792
01:19:20.530 --> 01:19:21.870
sing in the wind.

1793
01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:24.400
And Falstaff's boy with her!

1794
01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:27.570
Good plots, they are laid;

1795
01:19:27.570 --> 01:19:29.070
and our revolted wives

1796
01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:31.730
share damnation together.

1797
01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:33.900
Well; I will take him,

1798
01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:35.730
then torture my wife,

1799
01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:37.200
pluck the borrowed veil of modesty

1800
01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.430
from the so seeming Mistress Page,

1801
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:40.370
divulge Page himself

1802
01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:42.830
for a secure and wilful Actaeon;

1803
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:45.930
and to these violent proceedings

1804
01:19:45.930 --> 01:19:49.930
all my neighbours shall cry aim.

1805
01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:52.770
(Clock chimes)

1806
01:19:52.770 --> 01:19:54.830
The clock gives me my cue,

1807
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:57.070
and my assurance bids me search:

1808
01:19:57.070 --> 01:19:59.900
there I shall find Falstaff:

1809
01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:03.370
I shall be rather praised for this than mocked;

1810
01:20:03.370 --> 01:20:04.470
for it is as positive

1811
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:05.670
as the earth is firm

1812
01:20:05.670 --> 01:20:08.970
that Falstaff is there: I will go.

1813
01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.370
Well met, Master Ford.

1814
01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:12.770
Trust me, a good knot:

1815
01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:14.530
I have good cheer at home;

1816
01:20:14.530 --> 01:20:18.470
and I pray you all go with me.

1817
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:21.500
I must excuse myself, Master Ford.

1818
01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:22.400
And so must I, sir:

1819
01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:23.300
we have appointed to dine

1820
01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:24.470
with Mistress Anne,

1821
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:25.570
and I would not break with her

1822
01:20:25.570 --> 01:20:27.030
for more money than I'll speak of.

1823
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:29.400
We have lingered about a match

1824
01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.130
between Anne Page

1825
01:20:30.130 --> 01:20:31.570
and my cousin Slender,

1826
01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:33.470
and this day we shall have our answer.

1827
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:35.400
I hope I have your good will, father Page.

1828
01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:36.700
You have, Master Slender;

1829
01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:38.530
I stand wholly for you:

1830
01:20:38.530 --> 01:20:40.900
but my wife, master doctor,

1831
01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:41.970
is for you altogether.

1832
01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:44.930
Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me:

1833
01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:47.300
my nursh-a Quickly tell me so mush.

1834
01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:49.530
What say you to young Master Fenton?

1835
01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:52.100
he capers, he dances,

1836
01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:53.770
he has eyes of youth,

1837
01:20:53.770 --> 01:20:55.100
he writes verses,

1838
01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.730
he speaks holiday,

1839
01:20:56.730 --> 01:20:59.170
he smells April and May:

1840
01:20:59.170 --> 01:21:01.770
he will carry't, he will carry't; '

1841
01:21:01.770 --> 01:21:02.970
tis in his buttons;

1842
01:21:02.970 --> 01:21:04.100
he will carry't.

1843
01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:06.130
Not by my consent, I promise you.

1844
01:21:06.130 --> 01:21:08.700
The gentleman is of no having:

1845
01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:10.000
he kept company with the wild prince

1846
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:10.830
and Poins;

1847
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:12.600
he is of too high a region;

1848
01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.670
he knows too much.

1849
01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:16.400
No, he shall not knit a knot

1850
01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.230
in his fortunes

1851
01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:18.970
with the finger of my substance:

1852
01:21:18.970 --> 01:21:19.830
if he take her,

1853
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:21.400
let him take her simply;

1854
01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:24.070
the wealth I have waits on my consent,

1855
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:26.330
and my consent goes not that way.

1856
01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:30.830
I beseech you heartily,

1857
01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:33.230
some of you go home with me to dinner:

1858
01:21:33.230 --> 01:21:34.600
besides your cheer,

1859
01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:36.270
you shall have sport;

1860
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:39.030
I will show you a monster.

1861
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:40.500
Master doctor, you shall go;

1862
01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:43.500
so shall you, Master Page;

1863
01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.470
and you, Sir Hugh.

1864
01:21:48.130 --> 01:21:49.730
Well, fare you well:

1865
01:21:49.730 --> 01:21:50.970
we shall have the freer wooing

1866
01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:53.900
at Master Page's.

1867
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:59.370
Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.

1868
01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:01.170
Farewell, my hearts:

1869
01:22:01.170 --> 01:22:03.630
I will to my honest knight Falstaff,

1870
01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:06.600
and drink canary with him.

1871
01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:10.570
I think I shall drink in pipe wine first with him;

1872
01:22:10.570 --> 01:22:13.270
I'll make him dance.

1873
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:15.170
Will you go, gentles?

1874
01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:18.830
Have with you to see this monster.

1875
01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:27.400
(music)

1876
01:22:28.170 --> 01:22:30.730
What, John! What, Robert!

1877
01:22:30.730 --> 01:22:32.670
Quickly, quickly! is the buck-basket--

1878
01:22:32.670 --> 01:22:35.730
I warrant. What, Robert, I say!

1879
01:22:38.970 --> 01:22:40.100
Here, set it down.

1880
01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:41.400
Come, come, come.

1881
01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.270
Give your men the charge;

1882
01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:43.300
we must be brief.

1883
01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:45.000
Marry,

1884
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.030
as I told you before, John and Robert,

1885
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.970
be ready here hard by

1886
01:22:47.970 --> 01:22:48.900
in the brew-house:

1887
01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:50.200
and when I suddenly call you,

1888
01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.030
come forth,

1889
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:53.170
and without any pause or staggering

1890
01:22:53.170 --> 01:22:55.070
take this basket on your shoulders:

1891
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:56.530
that done, trudge with it

1892
01:22:56.530 --> 01:22:57.500
in all haste,

1893
01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:58.630
and carry it among the whitsters

1894
01:22:58.630 --> 01:22:59.700
in Datchet-mead,

1895
01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:02.270
and there empty it  -- in Datchet-mead --

1896
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:03.770
in the muddy ditch close

1897
01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:05.570
by the Thames side.

1898
01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:06.570
You will do it?

1899
01:23:06.570 --> 01:23:07.670
I ha' told them over and over;

1900
01:23:07.670 --> 01:23:09.600
they lack no direction.

1901
01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:13.200
Be gone, and come when you are called.

1902
01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:17.030
Here comes little Robin.

1903
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:19.500
How now, my eyas-musket!

1904
01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:20.500
what news with you?

1905
01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:21.500
My master, Sir John,

1906
01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.230
is come in at your back-door, Mistress Ford,

1907
01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:24.930
and requests your company.

1908
01:23:24.930 --> 01:23:26.200
You little Jack-a-Lent,

1909
01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.700
have you been true to us?

1910
01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:29.400
Ay, I'll be sworn.

1911
01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:30.630
My master knows not

1912
01:23:30.630 --> 01:23:31.430
of your being here

1913
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:32.270
and hath threatened to put me

1914
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:33.330
into everlasting liberty

1915
01:23:33.330 --> 01:23:34.800
if I tell you of it;

1916
01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.470
for he swears he'll turn me away.

1917
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:38.030
Thou'rt a good boy:

1918
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:39.630
this secrecy of thine

1919
01:23:39.630 --> 01:23:41.270
shall be a tailor to thee

1920
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:42.400
and shall make thee a new doublet

1921
01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.930
and hose. I'll go hide me.

1922
01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:50.370
Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone.

1923
01:23:54.330 --> 01:23:59.170
Mistress Page, remember you your cue.

1924
01:23:59.170 --> 01:23:59.900
I warrant thee;

1925
01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:02.600
if I do not act it, hiss me.

1926
01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:04.930
Go to, then:

1927
01:24:06.170 --> 01:24:10.400
we'll use this unwholesome humidity,

1928
01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:13.130
this gross watery pumpion;

1929
01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:16.700
we'll teach him to know turtles from jays.

1930
01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:18.130
Have I caught thee,

1931
01:24:18.130 --> 01:24:20.830
my heavenly jewel?

1932
01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:22.030
Why, now let me die,

1933
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:24.170
for I have lived long enough:

1934
01:24:24.170 --> 01:24:27.230
this is the period of my ambition:

1935
01:24:27.230 --> 01:24:29.730
O this blessed hour!

1936
01:24:29.730 --> 01:24:31.500
O sweet Sir John!

1937
01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:32.700
Mistress Ford, I cannot cog,

1938
01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:34.770
I cannot prate, Mistress Ford.

1939
01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:36.370
Now shall I sin in my wish:

1940
01:24:36.370 --> 01:24:38.570
I would thy husband were dead:

1941
01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:39.830
I'll speak it before the best lord;

1942
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:42.500
I would make thee my lady.

1943
01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:45.370
I your lady, Sir John!

1944
01:24:45.370 --> 01:24:47.270
alas, I should be a pitiful lady!

1945
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:48.970
Let the court of France

1946
01:24:48.970 --> 01:24:50.930
show me such another.

1947
01:24:50.930 --> 01:24:53.200
I see how thine eye

1948
01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:56.130
would emulate the diamond:

1949
01:24:56.130 --> 01:24:58.030
thou hast the right arched beauty

1950
01:24:58.030 --> 01:25:01.630
of the brow that becomes the ship-tire,

1951
01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:03.100
the tire-valiant, or any tire

1952
01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:04.400
of Venetian admittance.

1953
01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:05.700
A plain kerchief, Sir John:

1954
01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.030
my brows become nothing else;

1955
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:09.370
nor that well neither.

1956
01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:10.070
By the Lord,

1957
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:12.730
thou art a tyrant to say so:

1958
01:25:12.730 --> 01:25:15.570
thou wouldst make an absolute courtier;

1959
01:25:15.570 --> 01:25:17.830
and the firm fixture of thy foot

1960
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:19.070
would give an excellent motion

1961
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.830
to thy gait

1962
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:22.000
in a semi-circled farthingale.

1963
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.370
I see what thou wert,

1964
01:25:23.370 --> 01:25:24.070
if Fortune,

1965
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:26.030
not Nature were thy friend.

1966
01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:27.670
Come, thou canst not hide it.

1967
01:25:27.670 --> 01:25:30.830
Believe me, there is no such thing in me.

1968
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:33.670
What made me love thee?

1969
01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:35.030
let that persuade thee

1970
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:38.230
there's something extraordinary in thee.

1971
01:25:38.230 --> 01:25:39.630
Come, I cannot cog

1972
01:25:39.630 --> 01:25:41.670
and say thou art this and that,

1973
01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:44.230
like a many of these lisping hawthorn-buds,

1974
01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:46.630
that come like women in men's apparel,

1975
01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:49.430
and smell like Bucklersbury in simple time;

1976
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:53.470
I cannot: but I love thee;

1977
01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:59.870
none but thee; and thou deservest it.

1978
01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:02.170
Do not betray me, sir.

1979
01:26:02.170 --> 01:26:04.470
I fear you love Mistress Page.

1980
01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:07.270
Thou mightst as well say

1981
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:08.830
I love to walk by the Counter-gate,

1982
01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:10.030
which is as hateful to me

1983
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:12.600
as the reek of a lime-kiln.

1984
01:26:13.930 --> 01:26:18.700
Well, heaven knows how I love you;

1985
01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:20.800
and you shall one day find it.

1986
01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:23.270
Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.

1987
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:25.330
Nay, I must tell you, so you do;

1988
01:26:25.330 --> 01:26:27.870
or else I could not be in that mind.

1989
01:26:30.670 --> 01:26:32.230
Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford!

1990
01:26:32.230 --> 01:26:33.770
here's Mistress Page at the door,

1991
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:35.930
sweating and blowing and looking wildly,

1992
01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:38.030
and would needs speak with you presently.

1993
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:40.900
She shall not see me:

1994
01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:43.800
I will ensconce me

1995
01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:45.730
behind the arras.

1996
01:26:45.730 --> 01:26:47.100
Pray you, do so:

1997
01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:50.500
she's a very tattling woman.

1998
01:27:01.770 --> 01:27:04.670
What's the matter? how now!

1999
01:27:05.770 --> 01:27:07.530
O Mistress Ford, what have you done?

2000
01:27:07.530 --> 01:27:09.630
You're shamed, you're overthrown,

2001
01:27:09.630 --> 01:27:10.830
you're undone for ever!

2002
01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:12.000
What's the matter, good Mistress Page?

2003
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.630
O well-a-day, Mistress Ford!

2004
01:27:13.630 --> 01:27:15.000
having an honest man to your husband,

2005
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.130
to give him such cause of suspicion!

2006
01:27:17.130 --> 01:27:18.570
What cause of suspicion?

2007
01:27:18.570 --> 01:27:19.530
What cause of suspicion!

2008
01:27:19.530 --> 01:27:21.700
Out pon you! how am I mistook in you!

2009
01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:23.430
Why, alas, what's the matter?

2010
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:26.030
Your husband's coming hither, woman,

2011
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:27.830
with all the officers in Windsor,

2012
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:29.430
to search for a gentleman

2013
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:31.230
that he says is here now in the house

2014
01:27:31.230 --> 01:27:32.100
by your consent,

2015
01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:33.930
to take an ill advantage of his absence:

2016
01:27:33.930 --> 01:27:35.270
you are undone.

2017
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:37.300
'Tis not so, I hope.

2018
01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:39.530
Pray heaven it be not so,

2019
01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:40.900
that you have such a man here!

2020
01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:42.900
but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,

2021
01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:44.370
with half Windsor at his heels,

2022
01:27:44.370 --> 01:27:46.530
to search for such a one.

2023
01:27:47.130 --> 01:27:48.700
I come before to tell you.

2024
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:50.730
If you know yourself clear,

2025
01:27:50.730 --> 01:27:52.800
why, I am glad of it;

2026
01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.600
but if you have a friend here convey,

2027
01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:58.000
convey him out.

2028
01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:58.800
Be not amazed;

2029
01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.530
call all your senses to you;

2030
01:28:01.530 --> 01:28:02.500
defend your reputation,

2031
01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:03.230
or bid farewell

2032
01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:05.000
to your good life for ever.

2033
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
What shall I do?

2034
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.570
There is a gentleman my dear friend;

2035
01:28:09.570 --> 01:28:11.330
and I fear not mine own shame

2036
01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:12.700
so much as his peril:

2037
01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:14.670
I had rather than a thousand pound

2038
01:28:14.670 --> 01:28:16.500
he were out of the house.

2039
01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:17.330
For shame!

2040
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:18.230
never stand 'you had rather'

2041
01:28:18.230 --> 01:28:19.230
and 'you had rather:'

2042
01:28:19.230 --> 01:28:22.000
your husband's here at hand,

2043
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.070
bethink you of some conveyance:

2044
01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:26.530
in the house you cannot hide him.

2045
01:28:26.530 --> 01:28:29.900
O, how have you deceived me!

2046
01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:33.130
Look, here is a basket:

2047
01:28:33.130 --> 01:28:34.870
if he be of any reasonable stature,

2048
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:36.370
he may creep in here;

2049
01:28:36.370 --> 01:28:37.830
and throw foul linen upon him,

2050
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:39.170
as if it were going to bucking:

2051
01:28:39.170 --> 01:28:40.930
or--it is whiting-time

2052
01:28:40.930 --> 01:28:43.370
--send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.

2053
01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:46.270
He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?

2054
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:49.030
Let me see't, let me see't,

2055
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:51.800
O, let me see't!

2056
01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.430
I'll in, I'll in.

2057
01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:55.700
Follow your friend's counsel. I'll in.

2058
01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:57.870
What, Sir John Falstaff!

2059
01:28:57.870 --> 01:28:58.970
Why, Sir John!

2060
01:28:58.970 --> 01:29:01.400
Is this your love? Are these your letters, knight?

2061
01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.470
I love thee,  none but thee.

2062
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:04.600
Help me away.

2063
01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:08.530
Let me creep in here.

2064
01:29:08.530 --> 01:29:10.100
I'll never--

2065
01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:12.070
Help to cover your master, boy.

2066
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:13.800
Call your men, Mistress Ford.

2067
01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:16.330
What, John! Robert! John!

2068
01:29:16.330 --> 01:29:18.400
You dissembling knight!

2069
01:29:19.230 --> 01:29:21.430
Go take up these clothes here quickly.

2070
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:23.270
Where's the cowl-staff?

2071
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:25.030
look, how you drumble!

2072
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:29.330
Carry them to the laundress in Datchet-mead;

2073
01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:31.430
quickly, come.

2074
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:37.870
Pray you, come near:

2075
01:29:39.730 --> 01:29:42.370
if I suspect without cause,

2076
01:29:42.370 --> 01:29:43.800
why then make sport at me;

2077
01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.100
then let me be your jest;

2078
01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:47.230
I deserve it.

2079
01:29:49.970 --> 01:29:52.570
How now! whither bear you this?

2080
01:29:52.570 --> 01:29:54.270
To the laundress, forsooth.

2081
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:55.600
Why, what have you to do

2082
01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:56.530
whither they bear it?

2083
01:29:56.530 --> 01:29:58.600
You were best meddle with buck-washing.

2084
01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:00.100
Buck! I would I could wash myself

2085
01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:01.130
of the buck!

2086
01:30:01.130 --> 01:30:02.770
Buck, buck, buck!

2087
01:30:02.770 --> 01:30:04.870
Ay, buck; I warrant you, buck;

2088
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:06.900
and of the season too, it shall appear.

2089
01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:09.830
Gentlemen, I have dreamed to-night;

2090
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:12.330
I'll tell you my dream.

2091
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:19.670
Here, here, here be my keys:

2092
01:30:19.670 --> 01:30:20.900
ascend my chambers;

2093
01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:22.900
search, seek, find out:

2094
01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:26.630
I'll warrant we'll unkennel the fox.

2095
01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.430
Let me stop this way first.

2096
01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:34.900
So, now uncape.

2097
01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:37.400
Good Master Ford, be contented:

2098
01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:38.970
you wrong yourself too much.

2099
01:30:38.970 --> 01:30:40.900
True, Master Page.

2100
01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:41.600
Up, gentlemen:

2101
01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:43.800
you shall see sport anon:

2102
01:30:44.730 --> 01:30:47.100
follow me, gentlemen.

2103
01:30:47.570 --> 01:30:49.370
This is fery fantastical humours

2104
01:30:49.370 --> 01:30:50.400
and jealousies.

2105
01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:53.400
By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France;

2106
01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.070
it is not jealous in France.

2107
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:57.300
Nay, follow him, gentlemen;

2108
01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.800
see the issue of his search.

2109
01:31:10.130 --> 01:31:12.630
Is there not a double excellency in this?

2110
01:31:12.630 --> 01:31:14.270
I know not which pleases me better,

2111
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:16.930
that my husband is deceived, or Sir John.

2112
01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:18.070
What a taking was he in

2113
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:20.700
when your husband asked who was in the basket!

2114
01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:24.570
I warrent he will have need of washing;

2115
01:31:24.570 --> 01:31:25.530
so throwing him into the water

2116
01:31:25.530 --> 01:31:26.870
will do him a benefit.

2117
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:28.000
Hang him, dishonest rascal!

2118
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.530
I would all of the same strain

2119
01:31:29.530 --> 01:31:31.330
were in the same distress.

2120
01:31:57.170 --> 01:31:57.900
I think my husband

2121
01:31:57.900 --> 01:31:59.000
hath some special suspicion

2122
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.830
of Falstaff's being here;

2123
01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:02.170
for I never saw him so gross

2124
01:32:02.170 --> 01:32:04.130
in his jealousy till now.

2125
01:32:04.130 --> 01:32:05.930
I will lay a plot to try that;

2126
01:32:05.930 --> 01:32:07.430
and we will yet have more tricks

2127
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:08.230
with Falstaff:

2128
01:32:08.230 --> 01:32:09.100
his dissolute disease

2129
01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:11.000
will scarce obey this medicine.

2130
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.570
Shall we send that foolish carrion,

2131
01:32:12.570 --> 01:32:14.000
Mistress Quickly, to him,

2132
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
and excuse his throwing into the water;

2133
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.730
and give him another hope,

2134
01:32:17.730 --> 01:32:19.070
to betray him to another punishment?

2135
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:20.330
We will do it:

2136
01:32:20.330 --> 01:32:21.530
let him be sent for to-morrow,

2137
01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:23.400
eight o'clock, to have amends.

2138
01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.470
I cannot find him:

2139
01:32:30.230 --> 01:32:31.370
may be the knave bragged

2140
01:32:31.370 --> 01:32:33.500
of that he could not compass.

2141
01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:35.100
Heard you that?

2142
01:32:38.230 --> 01:32:40.330
You use me well, Master Ford, do you?

2143
01:32:40.330 --> 01:32:41.300
Ay, I do so.

2144
01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:42.370
Heaven make you better than your thoughts!

2145
01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:43.330
Amen!

2146
01:32:43.330 --> 01:32:45.030
You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.

2147
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:46.800
Ay, ay; I must bear it.

2148
01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.730
If there be any body in the house,

2149
01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:49.870
or in the chambers,

2150
01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:50.870
or in the coffers,

2151
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:52.070
or in the presses,

2152
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:53.000
heaven forgive my sins

2153
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.170
at the day of judgment!

2154
01:32:54.170 --> 01:32:56.130
By gar, nor I too:

2155
01:32:56.130 --> 01:32:58.370
there is no bodies.

2156
01:32:58.370 --> 01:32:59.570
Fie, fie, Master Ford!

2157
01:32:59.570 --> 01:33:01.430
are you not ashamed?

2158
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:02.300
What spirit,

2159
01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:04.400
what devil suggests this imagination?

2160
01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:05.730
I would not ha' your distemper

2161
01:33:05.730 --> 01:33:06.870
in this kind for the wealth

2162
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:08.500
of Windsor Castle.

2163
01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:09.600
'Tis my fault, Master Page:

2164
01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:10.770
I suffer for it.

2165
01:33:10.770 --> 01:33:13.130
You suffer for a bad conscience:

2166
01:33:13.130 --> 01:33:14.700
your wife is as honest a 'omans

2167
01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:16.800
as I will desires among five thousand,

2168
01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:18.530
and five hundred too.

2169
01:33:18.530 --> 01:33:22.000
By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.

2170
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.170
Well, I promised you a dinner.

2171
01:33:26.170 --> 01:33:27.670
Come,

2172
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:39.000
come, walk in the Park:

2173
01:33:40.330 --> 01:33:42.530
I pray you, pardon me;

2174
01:33:42.530 --> 01:33:43.800
I will hereafter make known to you

2175
01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:46.000
why I have done this.

2176
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:50.830
Come, wife; come, Mistress Page.

2177
01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.400
I pray you, pardon me;

2178
01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:57.530
pray heartily, pardon me.

2179
01:33:57.530 --> 01:33:59.770
Let's go in, gentlemen;

2180
01:33:59.770 --> 01:34:02.470
but, trust me, we'll mock him.

2181
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:03.530
I do invite you to-morrow morning

2182
01:34:03.530 --> 01:34:05.230
to my house to breakfast:

2183
01:34:05.230 --> 01:34:07.470
after, we'll a-birding together;

2184
01:34:07.470 --> 01:34:10.230
I have a fine hawk for the bush.

2185
01:34:10.230 --> 01:34:11.200
Shall it be so?

2186
01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:12.500
Any thing.

2187
01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:13.900
If there is one, I shall make two

2188
01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:14.770
in the company.

2189
01:34:14.770 --> 01:34:15.400
If dere be one or two,

2190
01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.700
I shall make-a the turd.

2191
01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:21.830
Pray you, go, Master Page.

2192
01:34:23.530 --> 01:34:24.870
I pray you now, remembrance tomorrow

2193
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:26.770
on the lousy knave, mine host.

2194
01:34:26.770 --> 01:34:28.500
Dat is good; by gar,

2195
01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:29.600
with all my heart!

2196
01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.000
A lousy knave,

2197
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.300
to have his gibes and his mockeries!

2198
01:34:44.730 --> 01:34:46.130
We'll leave a proof

2199
01:34:46.130 --> 01:34:48.070
by that which we will do

2200
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:53.230
wives may be merry, and yet honest too!

2201
01:35:01.930 --> 01:35:05.770
I see I cannot get thy father's love;

2202
01:35:05.770 --> 01:35:06.470
Therefore no more

2203
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:07.800
turn me to him, sweet Nan.

2204
01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:09.400
Alas, how then?

2205
01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:12.130
Why, thou must be thyself.

2206
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.730
He doth object

2207
01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:16.100
I am too great of birth--,

2208
01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:17.230
And that, my state being gall'd

2209
01:35:17.230 --> 01:35:18.170
with my expense,

2210
01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:20.900
I seek to heal it only by his wealth:

2211
01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:21.730
Besides these,

2212
01:35:21.730 --> 01:35:23.370
other bars he lays before me,

2213
01:35:23.370 --> 01:35:26.270
My riots past, my wild societies;

2214
01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:27.270
And tells me 'tis a thing impossible

2215
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:28.800
I should love thee but as a property.

2216
01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:29.930
May be he tells you true.

2217
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:32.500
No, heaven so speed me

2218
01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:34.470
in my time to come!

2219
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:36.600
Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth

2220
01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:37.530
Was the first motive

2221
01:35:37.530 --> 01:35:38.600
that I woo'd thee, Anne:

2222
01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:39.500
Yet, wooing thee,

2223
01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:40.870
I found thee of more value

2224
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:42.300
Than stamps in gold

2225
01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:44.200
or sums in sealed bags;

2226
01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.170
And 'tis the very riches of thyself

2227
01:35:46.170 --> 01:35:47.530
That now I aim at.

2228
01:35:47.530 --> 01:35:49.470
Gentle Master Fenton,

2229
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:50.870
Yet seek my father's love;

2230
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:52.930
still seek it, sir:

2231
01:35:52.930 --> 01:35:54.970
If opportunity and humblest suit

2232
01:35:54.970 --> 01:35:57.470
Cannot attain it,

2233
01:35:57.770 --> 01:36:01.700
why, then,--hark you hither!

2234
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:06.670
Break their talk, Mistress Quickly:

2235
01:36:06.670 --> 01:36:08.430
my kinsman shall speak for himself.

2236
01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:09.130
I'll make a shaft

2237
01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:10.500
or a bolt on't: 'slid, '

2238
01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:11.800
tis but venturing.

2239
01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.400
Be not dismayed.

2240
01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:14.430
No, she shall not dismay me:

2241
01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:16.130
I care not for that,

2242
01:36:16.130 --> 01:36:17.500
but that I am afeard.

2243
01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.570
Hark ye; Master Slender

2244
01:36:19.570 --> 01:36:21.170
would speak a word with you.

2245
01:36:21.170 --> 01:36:22.400
I come to him.

2246
01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.830
This is my father's choice.

2247
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:25.600
O, what a world

2248
01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.270
of vile ill-favor'd faults

2249
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:29.670
Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a-year!

2250
01:36:29.670 --> 01:36:32.570
And how does good Master Fenton?

2251
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:35.600
Pray you, a word with you.

2252
01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:42.470
She's coming; to her, coz.

2253
01:36:47.630 --> 01:36:50.200
O boy, thou hadst a father!

2254
01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:52.400
I had a father, Mistress Anne;

2255
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:56.300
my uncle can tell you good jests of him.

2256
01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:57.430
Pray you, uncle,

2257
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:59.230
tell Mistress Anne the jest,

2258
01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:01.200
how my father stole two geese

2259
01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:03.000
out of a pen, good uncle.

2260
01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:10.070
Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.

2261
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:12.300
Ay, that I do; as well as I love

2262
01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:14.500
any woman in Gloucestershire.

2263
01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:17.400
He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.

2264
01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:18.630
Ay, that I will, come cut

2265
01:37:18.630 --> 01:37:19.470
and long-tail,

2266
01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:21.230
under the degree of a squire.

2267
01:37:21.230 --> 01:37:23.430
He will make you a hundred

2268
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:25.170
and fifty pounds jointure.

2269
01:37:25.170 --> 01:37:26.130
Good Master Shallow,

2270
01:37:26.130 --> 01:37:28.230
let him woo for himself.

2271
01:37:28.670 --> 01:37:30.530
Marry, I thank you for it;

2272
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:32.870
I thank you for that good comfort.

2273
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:37.700
She calls you, coz: I'll leave you.

2274
01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:41.170
Now, Master Slender,--

2275
01:37:41.730 --> 01:37:43.570
Now, good Mistress Anne,--

2276
01:37:43.570 --> 01:37:45.770
What is your will?

2277
01:37:46.330 --> 01:37:49.170
My will! 'od's heartlings,

2278
01:37:49.170 --> 01:37:50.300
that's a pretty jest indeed!

2279
01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:51.700
I ne'er made my will yet,

2280
01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:52.500
I thank heaven;

2281
01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:53.470
I am not such a sickly creature,

2282
01:37:53.470 --> 01:37:54.530
I give heaven praise.

2283
01:37:54.530 --> 01:37:55.830
I mean, Master Slender,

2284
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:58.830
what would you with me?

2285
01:38:01.170 --> 01:38:03.000
Truly, for mine own part,

2286
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.570
I would little or nothing with you.

2287
01:38:07.570 --> 01:38:08.670
Your father and my uncle

2288
01:38:08.670 --> 01:38:10.400
hath made motions:

2289
01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:13.030
if it be my luck, so;

2290
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:16.030
if not, happy man be his dole!

2291
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:19.300
They can tell you how things go better than I.

2292
01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:21.570
You may ask your father; here he comes.

2293
01:38:22.930 --> 01:38:26.230
Now, Master Slender:

2294
01:38:28.570 --> 01:38:31.530
love him, daughter Anne.

2295
01:38:32.930 --> 01:38:33.700
Why, how now!

2296
01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:36.330
what does Master Fenton here?

2297
01:38:36.330 --> 01:38:37.570
You wrong me, sir,

2298
01:38:37.570 --> 01:38:38.970
thus still to haunt my house:

2299
01:38:38.970 --> 01:38:40.500
I told you, sir,

2300
01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:42.170
my daughter is disposed of.

2301
01:38:42.170 --> 01:38:44.830
Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.

2302
01:38:44.830 --> 01:38:47.630
Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.

2303
01:38:47.630 --> 01:38:48.900
She is no match for you.

2304
01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:50.170
Sir, will you hear me?

2305
01:38:50.170 --> 01:38:54.070
No, good Master Fenton.

2306
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.900
Come, Master Shallow;

2307
01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:57.600
come, son Slender, in.

2308
01:38:58.100 --> 01:38:59.330
Knowing my mind,

2309
01:38:59.330 --> 01:39:01.700
you wrong me, Master Fenton.

2310
01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:14.900
Speak to Mistress Page.

2311
01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:18.600
Good Mistress Page,

2312
01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:20.970
for that I love your daughter

2313
01:39:20.970 --> 01:39:23.600
In such a righteous fashion as I do,

2314
01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:24.930
Perforce, against all cheques,

2315
01:39:24.930 --> 01:39:27.370
rebukes and manners,

2316
01:39:27.370 --> 01:39:30.030
I must advance the colours of my love

2317
01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:31.800
And not retire:

2318
01:39:32.630 --> 01:39:34.900
let me have your good will.

2319
01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:36.770
Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.

2320
01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:39.130
I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.

2321
01:39:39.130 --> 01:39:41.070
That's my master, master doctor.

2322
01:39:41.070 --> 01:39:42.500
Alas, I had rather be set quick

2323
01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:43.370
i' the earth

2324
01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:45.300
And bowl'd to death with turnips!

2325
01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:47.970
Come, trouble not yourself.

2326
01:39:47.970 --> 01:39:50.170
Good Master Fenton,

2327
01:39:50.170 --> 01:39:53.970
I will not be your friend nor enemy:

2328
01:39:53.970 --> 01:39:55.470
My daughter will I question

2329
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:56.900
how she loves you,

2330
01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:00.830
And as I find her, so am I affected.

2331
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:03.200
Till then farewell, sir:

2332
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:04.700
she must needs go in;

2333
01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:06.770
Her father will be angry.

2334
01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:11.700
Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.

2335
01:40:14.630 --> 01:40:16.970
This is my doing, now: '

2336
01:40:16.970 --> 01:40:18.200
Nay,' said I,

2337
01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.230
'will you cast away your child on a fool,

2338
01:40:20.230 --> 01:40:21.700
and a physician?

2339
01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:25.200
Look on Master Fenton:' this is my doing.

2340
01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:29.400
I thank thee; and I pray thee,

2341
01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:30.670
once to-night

2342
01:40:30.670 --> 01:40:33.800
Give my sweet Nan this ring:

2343
01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:36.570
there's for thy pains.

2344
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:40.470
Now heaven send thee good fortune!

2345
01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:46.900
A kind heart he hath:

2346
01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:47.830
a woman would run

2347
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:49.070
through fire and water

2348
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:51.900
for such a kind heart.

2349
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:57.230
But yet I would my master

2350
01:40:57.230 --> 01:40:59.400
had Mistress Anne;

2351
01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:02.430
or I would Master Slender had her;

2352
01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:03.230
or, in sooth,

2353
01:41:03.230 --> 01:41:06.670
I would Master Fenton had her;

2354
01:41:07.670 --> 01:41:11.000
I will do what I can for them all three;

2355
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.170
for so I have promised,

2356
01:41:12.170 --> 01:41:15.270
and I'll be as good as my word;

2357
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:18.870
but speciously for Master Fenton.

2358
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:21.100
Well, I must of another errand

2359
01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:22.470
to Sir John Falstaff

2360
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:24.230
from my two mistresses:

2361
01:41:24.230 --> 01:41:26.970
what a beast am I to slack it!

2362
01:41:26.970 --> 01:41:40.500
(music)

2363
01:41:41.230 --> 01:41:47.330
Bardolph, I say,--

2364
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.400
Here, sir.

2365
01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:53.470
Go fetch me a quart of sack;

2366
01:41:53.930 --> 01:41:56.000
put a toast in't.

2367
01:42:03.970 --> 01:42:08.800
Have I lived to be carried in a basket,

2368
01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:11.200
like a barrow of butcher's offal,

2369
01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:14.800
and to be thrown in the Thames?

2370
01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:16.230
Well, if I be served such another trick,

2371
01:42:16.230 --> 01:42:18.000
I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered,

2372
01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:18.830
and give them to a dog

2373
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:20.930
for a new-year's gift.

2374
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:23.900
The rogues slighted me into the river

2375
01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:25.230
with as little remorse

2376
01:42:25.230 --> 01:42:26.000
as they would have drowned

2377
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:26.900
a blind bitch's puppies,

2378
01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:28.900
fifteen i' the litter:

2379
01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:30.470
and you may know by my size

2380
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:32.430
that I have a kind of alacrity

2381
01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:34.500
in sinking;

2382
01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:35.970
if the bottom were as deep as hell,

2383
01:42:35.970 --> 01:42:36.870
I should down.

2384
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:37.970
I had been drowned,

2385
01:42:37.970 --> 01:42:40.170
but that the shore was shelvy

2386
01:42:40.170 --> 01:42:44.900
and shallow,--a death that I abhor;

2387
01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:48.800
for the water swells a man;

2388
01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.470
and what a thing should I have been

2389
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:52.000
when I had been swelled!

2390
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.770
I should have been a mountain of mummy.

2391
01:43:06.230 --> 01:43:08.870
Here's Mistress Quickly, sir,

2392
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:10.430
to speak with you.

2393
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:11.600
Let me pour in some sack

2394
01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:12.700
to the Thames water;

2395
01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:13.900
for my belly's as cold

2396
01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:15.830
as if I had swallowed snowballs

2397
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:18.430
for pills to cool the kidneys.

2398
01:43:23.970 --> 01:43:24.730
Call her in.

2399
01:43:24.730 --> 01:43:26.200
Come in, woman!

2400
01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.970
By your leave; I cry you mercy:

2401
01:43:29.970 --> 01:43:32.200
give your worship good morrow.

2402
01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:37.230
Take away these chalices.

2403
01:43:37.230 --> 01:43:41.070
Go brew me a pottle of sack finely.

2404
01:43:41.070 --> 01:43:42.630
With eggs, sir?

2405
01:43:42.630 --> 01:43:44.600
Simple of itself;

2406
01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:47.600
I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage.

2407
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:58.070
How now!

2408
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:59.030
Marry, sir,

2409
01:43:59.030 --> 01:44:01.100
I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.

2410
01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:02.700
Mistress Ford!

2411
01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:05.070
I have had enough of ford;

2412
01:44:05.070 --> 01:44:07.170
I was thrown into the ford;

2413
01:44:07.170 --> 01:44:09.800
I have my belly full of ford.

2414
01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:10.600
Alas the day! good heart,

2415
01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:12.300
that was not her fault:

2416
01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:14.330
she does so take on with her men;

2417
01:44:14.330 --> 01:44:15.900
they mistook their erection.

2418
01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:16.900
So did I mine,

2419
01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:20.700
to build upon a foolish woman's promise.

2420
01:44:21.930 --> 01:44:24.930
Well, she laments, sir, for it,

2421
01:44:24.930 --> 01:44:28.870
that it would yearn your heart to see it.

2422
01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:35.830
Her husband goes this morning a-birding;

2423
01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:39.370
she desires you once more

2424
01:44:39.370 --> 01:44:44.070
to come to her between eight and nine:

2425
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:46.900
I must carry her word quickly:

2426
01:44:48.030 --> 01:44:53.430
she'll make you amends, I warrant you.

2427
01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:58.670
Well, I will visit her:

2428
01:44:58.670 --> 01:45:00.170
tell her so;

2429
01:45:00.170 --> 01:45:02.500
and bid her think what a man is:

2430
01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:04.500
let her consider his frailty,

2431
01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:07.230
and then judge of my merit.

2432
01:45:07.230 --> 01:45:08.430
I will tell her.

2433
01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:11.100
Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?

2434
01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:12.230
Eight and nine, sir.

2435
01:45:12.230 --> 01:45:15.230
Well, be gone: I will not miss her.

2436
01:45:15.230 --> 01:45:18.370
Peace be with you, sir.

2437
01:45:21.330 --> 01:45:24.400
I marvel I hear not of Master Brook;

2438
01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:26.800
he sent me word to stay within:

2439
01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:31.470
I like his money well. O, here he comes.

2440
01:45:31.470 --> 01:45:32.500
Bless you, sir!

2441
01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:33.700
Now, master Brook,

2442
01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:35.670
you come to know what hath passed

2443
01:45:35.670 --> 01:45:38.500
between me and Ford's wife?

2444
01:45:40.170 --> 01:45:43.830
That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.

2445
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:46.030
Master Brook, I will not lie to you:

2446
01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:49.830
I was at her house the hour she appointed me.

2447
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:51.200
And sped you, sir?

2448
01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:54.470
Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.

2449
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:55.270
How so, sir?

2450
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:57.170
Did she change her determination?

2451
01:45:57.170 --> 01:45:58.330
No, Master Brook;

2452
01:45:58.330 --> 01:46:01.370
but the peaking Cornuto her husband,

2453
01:46:01.370 --> 01:46:02.530
Master Brook,

2454
01:46:02.530 --> 01:46:06.170
comes me in the instant of our encounter,

2455
01:46:06.170 --> 01:46:08.130
after we had embraced,

2456
01:46:08.130 --> 01:46:09.430
kissed,

2457
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:10.830
protested,

2458
01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:12.270
and, as it were,

2459
01:46:12.270 --> 01:46:15.400
spoke the prologue of our comedy;

2460
01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:17.230
and at his heels a rabble of his companions,

2461
01:46:17.230 --> 01:46:18.770
thither provoked and instigated

2462
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:19.700
by his distemper, and,

2463
01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:22.370
forsooth, to search his house

2464
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:23.630
for his wife's love.

2465
01:46:23.630 --> 01:46:24.970
What, while you were there?

2466
01:46:24.970 --> 01:46:26.070
While I was there.

2467
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:27.500
And did he search for you,

2468
01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:29.300
and could not find you?

2469
01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:31.870
You shall hear.

2470
01:46:32.670 --> 01:46:33.600
As good luck would have it,

2471
01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.230
comes in one Mistress Page;

2472
01:46:35.230 --> 01:46:37.200
gives intelligence of Ford's approach;

2473
01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:38.830
and, in her invention

2474
01:46:38.830 --> 01:46:40.330
and Ford's wife's distraction,

2475
01:46:40.330 --> 01:46:44.300
they conveyed me into a buck-basket.

2476
01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:46.430
A buck-basket!

2477
01:46:47.130 --> 01:46:51.200
By the Lord, a buck-basket!

2478
01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:55.930
crammed me in with foul shirts and smocks,

2479
01:46:55.930 --> 01:46:59.200
socks, foul stockings,

2480
01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:00.800
greasy napkins;

2481
01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:02.370
that, Master Brook,

2482
01:47:02.370 --> 01:47:06.130
there was the rankest compound

2483
01:47:06.130 --> 01:47:10.900
of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.

2484
01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:12.900
And how long lay you there?

2485
01:47:13.770 --> 01:47:18.030
Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook,

2486
01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:20.600
what I have suffered to bring this woman

2487
01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:24.870
to evil for your good.

2488
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:27.070
Being thus crammed in the basket,

2489
01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:28.770
a couple of Ford's knaves,

2490
01:47:28.770 --> 01:47:29.630
his hinds,

2491
01:47:29.630 --> 01:47:31.870
were called forth by their mistress

2492
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:34.500
to carry me in the name of foul clothes

2493
01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:36.570
to Datchet-lane:

2494
01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:40.430
they took me on their shoulders;

2495
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:42.130
met the jealous knave their master

2496
01:47:42.130 --> 01:47:42.870
in the door,

2497
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:44.270
who asked them once or twice

2498
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:47.230
what they had in their basket:

2499
01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:49.570
I quaked for fear,

2500
01:47:49.570 --> 01:47:50.800
lest the lunatic knave

2501
01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:52.970
would have searched it;

2502
01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:54.600
but fate, ordaining

2503
01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:58.270
he should be a cuckold, held his hand.

2504
01:47:58.270 --> 01:48:00.170
Well: on went he for a search,

2505
01:48:00.170 --> 01:48:02.000
and away went I for foul clothes.

2506
01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:07.430
But mark the sequel, Master Brook:

2507
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:09.900
I suffered the pangs

2508
01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:12.800
of three several deaths;

2509
01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:15.300
first, an intolerable fright,

2510
01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:16.270
to be detected

2511
01:48:16.270 --> 01:48:18.900
with a jealous rotten bell-wether;

2512
01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:20.870
next, to be compassed,

2513
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:23.900
in the circumference of a peck,like a good bilbo,

2514
01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:26.400
hilt to point, heel to head;

2515
01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:29.200
and then, to be stopped in,

2516
01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:30.870
like a strong distillation,

2517
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:34.070
with stinking clothes that fretted

2518
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:35.170
in their own grease:

2519
01:48:35.170 --> 01:48:36.700
think of that,

2520
01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:38.200
--a man of my kidney,

2521
01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:39.970
--think of that,

2522
01:48:39.970 --> 01:48:40.700
--that am as subject

2523
01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:42.230
to heat as butter;

2524
01:48:42.230 --> 01:48:44.330
a man of continual dissolution

2525
01:48:44.330 --> 01:48:45.600
and thaw:

2526
01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.470
it was a miracle to scape suffocation.

2527
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:51.830
And in the height of this bath,

2528
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:53.530
when I was more than half stewed in grease,

2529
01:48:53.530 --> 01:48:54.900
like a Dutch dish,

2530
01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:58.330
to be thrown into the Thames,

2531
01:48:58.330 --> 01:49:00.570
and cooled, glowing hot,

2532
01:49:00.570 --> 01:49:03.070
in that surge, like a horse-shoe;

2533
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:04.570
think of that,

2534
01:49:04.570 --> 01:49:05.330
--hissing hot,

2535
01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:06.870
--think of that, Master Brook.

2536
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:08.100
In good sadness,

2537
01:49:08.100 --> 01:49:09.900
I am sorry that for my sake

2538
01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:12.000
you have sufferd all this.

2539
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.600
My suit then is desperate;

2540
01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:15.970
you'll undertake her no more?

2541
01:49:16.770 --> 01:49:18.030
Master Brook,

2542
01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:19.870
I will be thrown into Etna,

2543
01:49:19.870 --> 01:49:21.970
as I have been into Thames,

2544
01:49:21.970 --> 01:49:24.530
ere I will leave her thus.

2545
01:49:27.930 --> 01:49:30.070
Her husband is this morning

2546
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:33.930
gone a-birding:

2547
01:49:33.930 --> 01:49:36.300
I have received from her

2548
01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:40.100
another embassy of meeting;

2549
01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:42.370
'twixt eight and nine is the hour,

2550
01:49:42.370 --> 01:49:43.800
Master Brook.

2551
01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:45.930
'Tis past eight already, sir.

2552
01:49:45.930 --> 01:49:46.870
Is it?

2553
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:48.900
I will then address me to my appointment.

2554
01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:50.500
Come to me at your convenient leisure,

2555
01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:53.500
and you shall know how I speed;

2556
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:57.970
Adieu.

2557
01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:05.630
You shall have her, Master Brook;

2558
01:50:06.170 --> 01:50:12.430
Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.

2559
01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:21.830
Hum! ha! is this a vision?

2560
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:24.200
is this a dream?

2561
01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:25.530
do I sleep?

2562
01:50:25.530 --> 01:50:29.070
Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!

2563
01:50:29.070 --> 01:50:29.970
there's a hole made

2564
01:50:29.970 --> 01:50:32.800
in your best coat, Master Ford.

2565
01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:34.870
This 'tis to be married!

2566
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:37.900
this 'tis to have linen and buck-baskets!

2567
01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:40.030
Well, I will proclaim myself

2568
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:41.130
what I am:

2569
01:50:41.130 --> 01:50:43.770
I will now take the lecher;

2570
01:50:43.770 --> 01:50:44.800
he is at my house;

2571
01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:46.230
he cannot 'scape me;

2572
01:50:46.230 --> 01:50:47.600
'tis impossible he should;

2573
01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:49.900
he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,

2574
01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:51.730
nor into a pepper-box:

2575
01:50:51.730 --> 01:50:53.100
but, lest the devil that guides him

2576
01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:54.330
should aid him,

2577
01:50:54.330 --> 01:50:57.200
I will search impossible places.

2578
01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:59.070
Though what I am I cannot avoid,

2579
01:50:59.070 --> 01:50:59.770
yet to be what I would not

2580
01:50:59.770 --> 01:51:01.900
shall not make me tame:

2581
01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:03.500
if I have horns to make one mad,

2582
01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:05.730
let the proverb go with me:

2583
01:51:05.730 --> 01:51:08.700
I'll be horn-mad.

2584
01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:15.770
(music)

2585
01:51:15.770 --> 01:51:19.530


2586
01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:33.870
Sir, the Germans have come

2587
01:51:33.870 --> 01:51:36.200
and desire to have three of your horses:

2588
01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:38.170
the duke himself will be at court to-morrow,

2589
01:51:38.170 --> 01:51:40.070
and they are going to meet him.

2590
01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:42.730
What duke should that be comes so secretly?

2591
01:51:42.730 --> 01:51:46.070
I hear not of him in the court.

2592
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:48.070
Let me speak with the gentlemen:

2593
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:49.470
they speak English?

2594
01:51:49.470 --> 01:51:52.600
Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.

2595
01:51:52.970 --> 01:51:55.700
They shall have my horses; but I'll make them pay;

2596
01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:57.370
I'll sauce them:

2597
01:51:57.370 --> 01:51:59.670
they have had my house a week at command;

2598
01:51:59.670 --> 01:52:03.970
I have turned away my other guests: they must come off;

2599
01:52:03.970 --> 01:52:06.800
I'll sauce them. Come.

2600
01:52:22.570 --> 01:52:24.300
Is he at Master Ford's already, think'st thou?

2601
01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:25.630
Sure he is by this,

2602
01:52:25.630 --> 01:52:27.430
or will be presently:

2603
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:29.670
but, truly, he is very courageous mad

2604
01:52:29.670 --> 01:52:31.830
about his throwing into the water.

2605
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:35.000
Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly.

2606
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.600
I'll be with her by and by;

2607
01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:39.830
I'll but bring my young man here to school.

2608
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:41.130
Look, where his master comes;

2609
01:52:41.130 --> 01:52:43.170
'tis a playing-day, I see.

2610
01:52:43.170 --> 01:52:45.600
How now, Sir Hugh! no school to-day?

2611
01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:47.370
No; Master Slender

2612
01:52:47.370 --> 01:52:49.230
is let the boys leave to play.

2613
01:52:49.230 --> 01:52:50.830
Blessing of his heart!

2614
01:52:50.830 --> 01:52:53.170
Sir Hugh, my husband says my son

2615
01:52:53.170 --> 01:52:56.200
profits nothing in the world at his book.

2616
01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:59.800
I pray you, ask him some questions in his accidence.

2617
01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:04.100
Come hither, William;

2618
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:06.530
hold up your head; come.

2619
01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:07.970
Come on, sirrah; hold up your head;

2620
01:53:07.970 --> 01:53:10.300
answer your master, be not afraid.

2621
01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:13.130
What is 'fair,' William?

2622
01:53:13.130 --> 01:53:14.300
Pulcher.

2623
01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:17.530
Polecats! there are fairer things than polecats, sure.

2624
01:53:17.530 --> 01:53:18.800
Peace your tattlings!

2625
01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:20.530
You are a very simplicity 'oman:

2626
01:53:20.530 --> 01:53:23.500
I pray you peace.

2627
01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:26.030
What is 'lapis,' William?

2628
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:27.300
A stone.

2629
01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:33.600
And what is 'a stone,' William?

2630
01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.200
A pebble.

2631
01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:37.400
No, it is 'lapis:'

2632
01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:39.570
I pray you, remember in your prain.

2633
01:53:39.570 --> 01:53:40.430
Lapis.

2634
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:42.700
That is a good William.

2635
01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:44.400
What is he, William,

2636
01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:45.870
that does lend articles?

2637
01:53:45.870 --> 01:53:48.100
Articles are borrowed of the pronoun,

2638
01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:50.100
and be thus declined, Singulariter,

2639
01:53:50.100 --> 01:53:51.270
nominativo,

2640
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:52.830
hic, haec, hoc.

2641
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:55.730
Accusativo, hinc.

2642
01:53:55.730 --> 01:53:59.400
I pray you, have your remembrance, child,

2643
01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:00.730
accusativo...

2644
01:54:00.730 --> 01:54:03.530
hinc...

2645
01:54:03.530 --> 01:54:04.700
...hang, hog.

2646
01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:07.730
'Hang-hog' is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.

2647
01:54:07.730 --> 01:54:09.900
Cease your prabbles.

2648
01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:13.300
What is your genitive case plural, William?

2649
01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:14.970
Genitive case!

2650
01:54:14.970 --> 01:54:15.970
Ay.

2651
01:54:15.970 --> 01:54:23.600
Genitive,--horum, harum, horum.

2652
01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:26.030
Vengeance of Jenny's case! fie on her!

2653
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:27.900
never name her, child, if she be a whore.

2654
01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:28.930
For shame, 'oman.

2655
01:54:28.930 --> 01:54:31.130
You do ill to teach the child such words:

2656
01:54:31.130 --> 01:54:32.930
he teaches him to hick and to hack,

2657
01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:34.900
which they'll do fast enough of themselves,

2658
01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:37.330
and to call 'horum:' shame on you!

2659
01:54:37.330 --> 01:54:39.330
'Oman, art thou lunatics?

2660
01:54:39.330 --> 01:54:41.030
hast thou no understandings for thy cases

2661
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:43.970
and the numbers of the genders?

2662
01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:46.230
You art as foolish Christian creatures as I would desires.

2663
01:54:46.230 --> 01:54:47.770
I prithee, hold thy peace.

2664
01:54:47.770 --> 01:54:49.770
Go your ways, and play; go.

2665
01:54:49.770 --> 01:54:50.570
He is a better scholar

2666
01:54:50.570 --> 01:54:51.900
than I thought he was.

2667
01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:56.530
He is a good sprag memory.

2668
01:54:56.530 --> 01:54:57.930
Farewell, Mistress Page.

2669
01:54:57.930 --> 01:54:59.670
Adieu, good Sir Hugh.

2670
01:54:59.670 --> 01:55:04.970
Get you home, boy. Come, we stay too long.

2671
01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:19.830
Mistress Ford,

2672
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:24.200
your sorrow hath eaten up my sufferance.

2673
01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:29.130
I see you are obsequious in your love,

2674
01:55:29.130 --> 01:55:30.370
and I profess requital

2675
01:55:30.370 --> 01:55:32.570
to a hair's breadth;

2676
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:34.300
not only, Mistress Ford,

2677
01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:38.670
in the simple office of love,

2678
01:55:38.670 --> 01:55:41.930
but in all the accoutrement,

2679
01:55:41.930 --> 01:55:45.930
complement and ceremony of it.

2680
01:55:45.930 --> 01:55:51.370
But are you sure of your husband now?

2681
01:55:51.370 --> 01:55:55.370
He's a-birding, sweet Sir John.

2682
01:55:55.370 --> 01:56:03.070
What, ho, gossip Ford! what, ho!

2683
01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:08.770
Step into the chamber, Sir John.

2684
01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:13.770
How now, sweetheart!

2685
01:56:13.770 --> 01:56:16.100
who's at home besides yourself?

2686
01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:18.800
Why, none but mine own people.

2687
01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:20.100
Indeed!

2688
01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:23.070
No, certainly.

2689
01:56:23.070 --> 01:56:26.670
Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.

2690
01:56:26.670 --> 01:56:27.770
Why?

2691
01:56:27.770 --> 01:56:30.630
Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again:

2692
01:56:30.630 --> 01:56:33.330
he so takes on yonder with my husband;

2693
01:56:33.330 --> 01:56:36.370
so rails against all married mankind;

2694
01:56:36.370 --> 01:56:38.670
so curses all Eve's daughters,

2695
01:56:38.670 --> 01:56:40.270
of what complexion soever;

2696
01:56:40.270 --> 01:56:43.270
and so buffets himself on the forehead, crying,

2697
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:45.700
'Peer out, peer out!

2698
01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:47.470
' that any madness I ever yet beheld

2699
01:56:47.470 --> 01:56:49.600
seemed but tameness, civility and patience,

2700
01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:52.470
to this his distemper he is in now:

2701
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:54.900
I am glad the fat knight is not here.

2702
01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:55.900
Why, does he talk of him?

2703
01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:57.300
Of none but him;

2704
01:56:57.300 --> 01:56:58.370
and swears he was carried out,

2705
01:56:58.370 --> 01:57:00.830
the last time he searched for him, in a basket;

2706
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:03.230
protests to my husband he is now here,

2707
01:57:03.230 --> 01:57:04.300
and hath drawn him

2708
01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:05.930
and the rest of their company from their sport,

2709
01:57:05.930 --> 01:57:08.070
to make another experiment of his suspicion:

2710
01:57:08.070 --> 01:57:09.200
but I am glad the knight is not here;

2711
01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:11.500
now he shall see his own foolery.

2712
01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:13.530
How near is he, Mistress Page?

2713
01:57:13.530 --> 01:57:15.170
Hard by; at street end;

2714
01:57:15.170 --> 01:57:16.900
he will be here anon.

2715
01:57:16.900 --> 01:57:20.070
I am undone! The knight is here.

2716
01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:22.500
Why then you are utterly shamed,

2717
01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:24.730
and he's but a dead man.

2718
01:57:24.730 --> 01:57:26.970
What a woman are you!

2719
01:57:26.970 --> 01:57:27.830
--Away with him, away with him!

2720
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:29.230
better shame than murder.

2721
01:57:29.230 --> 01:57:30.000
Which way should be go?

2722
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.130
how should I bestow him?

2723
01:57:31.130 --> 01:57:33.130
Shall I put him into the basket again?

2724
01:57:33.130 --> 01:57:37.570
No, I'll come no more i' the basket.

2725
01:57:37.570 --> 01:57:39.570
May I not go out ere he come?

2726
01:57:39.570 --> 01:57:41.330
Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers

2727
01:57:41.330 --> 01:57:42.730
watch the door with pistols,

2728
01:57:42.730 --> 01:57:43.730
that none shall issue out;

2729
01:57:43.730 --> 01:57:45.670
otherwise you might slip away ere he came.

2730
01:57:45.670 --> 01:57:47.630
But what make you here?

2731
01:57:47.630 --> 01:57:49.030
What shall I do?

2732
01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:52.600
I'll creep up into the chimney.

2733
01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:53.870
There they always use

2734
01:57:53.870 --> 01:57:56.800
to discharge their birding-pieces.

2735
01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:59.030
Creep into the kiln-hole.

2736
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.870
Where is it?

2737
01:57:59.870 --> 01:58:01.770
He will seek there, on my word.

2738
01:58:01.770 --> 01:58:05.000
Neither press, coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault,

2739
01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:05.970
but he hath an abstract

2740
01:58:05.970 --> 01:58:07.370
for the remembrance of such places,

2741
01:58:07.370 --> 01:58:09.470
and goes to them by his note:

2742
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:10.930
there is no hiding you in the house.

2743
01:58:10.930 --> 01:58:12.600
I'll go out then.

2744
01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:17.530
If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir John.

2745
01:58:17.530 --> 01:58:20.270
Unless you go out disguised--

2746
01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:21.530
How might we disguise him?

2747
01:58:21.530 --> 01:58:22.800
Alas the day, I know not!

2748
01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:24.500
There is no woman's gown big enough for him

2749
01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:25.500
otherwise he might put on a hat,

2750
01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:27.830
a kerchief and a muffler, and so escape.

2751
01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:29.930
Good hearts, devise something:

2752
01:58:29.930 --> 01:58:32.970
any extremity rather than a mischief.

2753
01:58:32.970 --> 01:58:36.770
My maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a gown above.

2754
01:58:36.770 --> 01:58:38.070
On my word, it will serve him;

2755
01:58:38.070 --> 01:58:39.830
she's as big as he is:

2756
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:41.570
and there's her thrummed hat and her muffler too.

2757
01:58:41.570 --> 01:58:43.070
Run up, Sir John.

2758
01:58:43.070 --> 01:58:44.270
Go, go, sweet Sir John:

2759
01:58:44.270 --> 01:58:46.430
Mistress Page and I will look some linen for your head.

2760
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:49.070
Quick, quick!

2761
01:58:49.070 --> 01:58:50.000
we'll come dress you straight:

2762
01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.370
put on the gown the while.

2763
01:58:52.370 --> 01:58:56.100
I would my husband would meet him in this shape:

2764
01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:57.830
he cannot abide the old woman of Brentford;

2765
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:59.630
he swears she's a witch;

2766
01:58:59.630 --> 01:59:02.600
forbade her my house and hath threatened to beat her.

2767
01:59:02.600 --> 01:59:05.500
Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel,

2768
01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:08.130
and the devil guide his cudgel afterwards!

2769
01:59:08.130 --> 01:59:09.630
But is my husband coming?

2770
01:59:09.630 --> 01:59:11.830
Ah, in good sadness, is he;

2771
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:13.170
and talks of the basket too,

2772
01:59:13.170 --> 01:59:16.300
howsoever he hath had intelligence.

2773
01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:17.530
We'll try that;

2774
01:59:17.530 --> 01:59:19.600
for I'll appoint my men to carry the basket again,

2775
01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:21.630
to meet him at the door with it, as they did last time.

2776
01:59:21.630 --> 01:59:23.470
Nay, but he'll be here presently:

2777
01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:24.930
let's go dress him like the witch of Brentford.

2778
01:59:24.930 --> 01:59:27.200
I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the basket.

2779
01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:29.670
Oh John! Robert!

2780
01:59:29.670 --> 01:59:32.130
Go up; I'll bring linen for him straight.

2781
01:59:32.130 --> 01:59:33.200
Hang him, dishonest varlet!

2782
01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:35.370
we cannot misuse him enough.

2783
01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:43.200
Go, sirs, carry this basket again on your shoulders:

2784
01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:44.400
your master is hard at door;

2785
01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:46.170
if he bid you set it down, obey him:

2786
01:59:46.170 --> 01:59:49.830
quickly, dispatch.

2787
01:59:50.930 --> 01:59:53.270
Come, come, take it up.

2788
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:55.270
Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.

2789
01:59:55.270 --> 01:59:56.400
I hope not;

2790
01:59:56.400 --> 01:59:59.730
I had as lief bear so much lead.

2791
02:00:05.470 --> 02:00:08.300
Ay, but if it prove true,

2792
02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:09.530
Master Page,

2793
02:00:09.530 --> 02:00:12.100
have you any way then to unfool me again?

2794
02:00:15.330 --> 02:00:20.170
Set down the basket, villain!

2795
02:00:20.170 --> 02:00:21.930
Somebody call my wife.

2796
02:00:21.930 --> 02:00:23.800
Youth in a basket!

2797
02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:26.530
O you panderly rascals!

2798
02:00:26.530 --> 02:00:28.900
there's a knot, a ging,

2799
02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:31.970
a pack, a conspiracy against me:

2800
02:00:31.970 --> 02:00:34.370
now shall the devil be shamed.

2801
02:00:34.370 --> 02:00:37.230
What, wife, I say! Come, come forth!

2802
02:00:37.230 --> 02:00:42.530
Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!

2803
02:00:42.530 --> 02:00:44.170
Why, this passes, Master Ford;

2804
02:00:44.170 --> 02:00:45.270
you are not to go loose any longer;

2805
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:47.230
you must be pinioned.

2806
02:00:47.230 --> 02:00:48.300
Why, this is lunatics!

2807
02:00:48.300 --> 02:00:49.700
this is mad as a mad dog!

2808
02:00:49.700 --> 02:00:51.770
Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.

2809
02:00:51.770 --> 02:00:52.970
So say I too, sir.

2810
02:00:52.970 --> 02:00:56.430
Come hither, Mistress Ford;

2811
02:00:56.430 --> 02:01:01.130
Mistress Ford the honest woman,

2812
02:01:01.130 --> 02:01:03.230
the modest wife, the virtuous creature,

2813
02:01:03.230 --> 02:01:05.870
that hath the jealous fool to her husband!

2814
02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:07.630
I suspect without cause, mistress, do I?

2815
02:01:07.630 --> 02:01:09.770
Heaven be my witness you do,

2816
02:01:09.770 --> 02:01:12.170
if you suspect me in any dishonesty.

2817
02:01:12.170 --> 02:01:22.330
Well said, brazen-face! hold it out.

2818
02:01:22.330 --> 02:01:24.400
Come forth, sirrah!

2819
02:01:34.170 --> 02:01:36.570
This passes!

2820
02:01:36.570 --> 02:01:38.570
Are you not ashamed? let the clothes alone.

2821
02:01:38.570 --> 02:01:40.630
I shall find you anon.

2822
02:01:40.630 --> 02:01:42.130
'Tis unreasonable!

2823
02:01:42.130 --> 02:01:43.670
Will you take up your wife's clothes?

2824
02:01:43.670 --> 02:01:44.230
Come away.

2825
02:01:44.230 --> 02:01:45.070
Empty the basket, I say!

2826
02:01:45.070 --> 02:01:46.100
Why, man, why?

2827
02:01:46.100 --> 02:01:47.770
Master Page, as I am a man,

2828
02:01:47.770 --> 02:01:50.930
there was one conveyed out of my house yesterday in this basket:

2829
02:01:50.930 --> 02:01:52.570
why may not he be there again?

2830
02:01:52.570 --> 02:01:54.570
In my house I am sure he is:

2831
02:01:54.570 --> 02:01:55.970
my intelligence is true;

2832
02:01:55.970 --> 02:01:59.100
my jealousy is reasonable.

2833
02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:05.030
Pluck me out all the linen.

2834
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:09.230
If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death.

2835
02:02:09.230 --> 02:02:11.270
Here's no man.

2836
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:14.330
By my fidelity, Master Ford, this is not well,

2837
02:02:14.330 --> 02:02:15.370
this wrongs you.

2838
02:02:15.370 --> 02:02:17.200
Master Ford, you must pray,

2839
02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:19.870
and not follow the imaginations of your own heart:

2840
02:02:19.870 --> 02:02:21.770
this is jealousies.

2841
02:02:21.770 --> 02:02:23.670
Well, he's not here I seek for.

2842
02:02:23.670 --> 02:02:29.830
No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.

2843
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:32.730
Help to search my house this one time.

2844
02:02:32.730 --> 02:02:34.770
If I find not what I seek,

2845
02:02:34.770 --> 02:02:37.170
show no colour for my extremity;

2846
02:02:37.170 --> 02:02:41.170
let me for ever be your table-sport;

2847
02:02:41.170 --> 02:02:43.330
let them say of me,

2848
02:02:43.330 --> 02:02:44.370
'As jealous as Ford,

2849
02:02:44.370 --> 02:02:45.670
Chat searched a hollow walnut

2850
02:02:45.670 --> 02:02:46.800
for his wife's leman.'

2851
02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:51.230
Satisfy me once more;

2852
02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:54.330
once more search with me.

2853
02:02:55.970 --> 02:02:58.270
Mistress Page! come you and the old woman down;

2854
02:02:58.270 --> 02:02:59.800
my husband will come into the chamber.

2855
02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:02.230
Old woman! what old woman's that?

2856
02:03:02.230 --> 02:03:06.370
Nay, it is my maid's aunt of Brentford.

2857
02:03:06.370 --> 02:03:11.230
A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean!

2858
02:03:11.230 --> 02:03:12.900
Have I not forbid her my house?

2859
02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:14.970
She comes of errands, does she?

2860
02:03:14.970 --> 02:03:16.830
We are simple men;

2861
02:03:16.830 --> 02:03:18.770
we do not know what's brought to pass

2862
02:03:18.770 --> 02:03:21.000
under the profession of fortune-telling.

2863
02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:26.270
She works by charms, by spells, by the figure,

2864
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:28.030
and such daubery as this is,

2865
02:03:28.030 --> 02:03:30.400
beyond our element we know nothing.

2866
02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:32.600
Come down, you witch,

2867
02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:34.600
you hag, you; come down, I say!

2868
02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:37.030
Nay, good, sweet husband!

2869
02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:40.230
Good gentlemen, let him not strike the old woman.

2870
02:03:43.530 --> 02:03:45.670
Come, Mother Prat;

2871
02:03:45.670 --> 02:03:48.400
come, give me your hand.

2872
02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:53.170
I'll prat her.

2873
02:03:53.170 --> 02:03:54.770
Out of my door, you witch,

2874
02:03:54.770 --> 02:03:56.700
you hag, you baggage,

2875
02:03:56.700 --> 02:03:58.770
you polecat, you runyon!

2876
02:03:58.770 --> 02:04:05.570
out, out! I'll conjure you,

2877
02:04:05.570 --> 02:04:09.530
I'll fortune-tell you.

2878
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:59.070
Are you not ashamed?

2879
02:04:59.070 --> 02:05:00.700
I think you have killed the poor woman.

2880
02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:01.530
Nay, he will do it.

2881
02:05:01.530 --> 02:05:02.930
'Tis a goodly credit for you.

2882
02:05:02.930 --> 02:05:05.100
Hang her, witch!

2883
02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:06.030
By the yea and no,

2884
02:05:06.030 --> 02:05:08.300
I think the 'oman is a witch indeed:

2885
02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:11.530
I like not when a 'oman has a great peard;

2886
02:05:11.530 --> 02:05:13.870
I spy a great peard under his muffler.

2887
02:05:13.870 --> 02:05:16.030
Will you follow, gentlemen?

2888
02:05:16.030 --> 02:05:17.200
I beseech you, follow;

2889
02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:20.470
see but the issue of my jealousy:

2890
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:21.930
if I cry out thus upon no trail,

2891
02:05:21.930 --> 02:05:25.570
never trust me when I open again.

2892
02:05:26.170 --> 02:05:30.000
Let's obey his humour a little further:

2893
02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.600
come, gentlemen.

2894
02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:46.300
Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.

2895
02:05:46.300 --> 02:05:47.630
Nay, by the mass, that he did not;

2896
02:05:47.630 --> 02:05:49.830
he beat him most unpitifully, methought.

2897
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:51.930
I'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o'er the altar;

2898
02:05:51.930 --> 02:05:55.670
it hath done meritorious service.

2899
02:05:55.670 --> 02:05:56.900
What think you? may we,

2900
02:05:56.900 --> 02:05:58.670
with the warrant of womanhood

2901
02:05:58.670 --> 02:06:00.170
and the witness of a good conscience,

2902
02:06:00.170 --> 02:06:02.730
pursue him with any further revenge?

2903
02:06:02.730 --> 02:06:03.900
The spirit of wantonness is,

2904
02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:06.370
sure, scared out of him:

2905
02:06:06.370 --> 02:06:10.170
he will never, I think, attempt us again.

2906
02:06:12.130 --> 02:06:17.970
(laughing like a maniac)

2907
02:06:20.430 --> 02:06:23.730
(gunshots)

2908
02:06:48.770 --> 02:06:51.000
Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him?

2909
02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:52.500
Yes, by all means;

2910
02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:53.800
if it be but to scrape the figures

2911
02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:57.200
out of your husband's brains.

2912
02:06:57.200 --> 02:06:58.700
If they can find in their hearts

2913
02:06:58.700 --> 02:07:00.600
the poor unvirtuous fat knight

2914
02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:02.770
shall be any further afflicted,

2915
02:07:02.770 --> 02:07:07.500
we two will still be the ministers.

2916
02:07:07.730 --> 02:07:13.030
I'll warrant they'll have him publicly shamed:

2917
02:07:13.030 --> 02:07:15.500
and methinks there would be no period to the jest,

2918
02:07:15.500 --> 02:07:18.700
should he not be publicly shamed.

2919
02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:20.500
Come, to the forge with it then; shape it:

2920
02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:22.670
I would not have things cool.

2921
02:07:32.630 --> 02:07:39.000
(dogs barking)

2922
02:07:48.970 --> 02:07:51.000
I would all the world were cozened;

2923
02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:55.070
for I have been cozened and beaten too.

2924
02:07:55.070 --> 02:07:56.070
If it should come

2925
02:07:56.070 --> 02:07:56.830
to the ear of the court,

2926
02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:58.500
how I have been transformed

2927
02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:01.530
and how my transformation hath been washed and cudgelled,

2928
02:08:01.530 --> 02:08:05.930
they would melt me out of my fat drop by drop

2929
02:08:05.930 --> 02:08:07.730
and liquor fisherman's boots with me.

2930
02:08:07.730 --> 02:08:12.000
I warrant they would whip me with their fine wits

2931
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:16.100
till I were as crest-fallen as a dried pear.

2932
02:08:16.100 --> 02:08:20.900
I never prospered since I forswore myself at primero.

2933
02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:24.770
Well, if I had wind enough to say my prayers,

2934
02:08:24.770 --> 02:08:30.200
I would repent.

2935
02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:33.130
(barking)

2936
02:08:35.230 --> 02:08:37.300
'Tis one of the best discretions

2937
02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:39.900
of a 'oman as ever I did look upon.

2938
02:08:39.900 --> 02:08:42.470
And did he send you both these letters at an instant?

2939
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:45.100
Within a quarter of an hour.

2940
02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:56.830
Pardon me, wife.

2941
02:08:56.830 --> 02:09:00.170
Henceforth do what thou wilt;

2942
02:09:00.170 --> 02:09:02.900
I rather will suspect the sun with cold

2943
02:09:02.900 --> 02:09:05.030
Than thee with wantonness:

2944
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:06.670
now doth thy honour stand

2945
02:09:06.670 --> 02:09:09.430
In him that was of late an heretic,

2946
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:15.100
As firm as faith.

2947
02:09:15.100 --> 02:09:21.970
'Tis well, 'tis well; no more:

2948
02:09:22.730 --> 02:09:25.270
Be not as extreme in submission

2949
02:09:25.270 --> 02:09:27.700
As in offence.

2950
02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:30.430
But let our plot go forward:

2951
02:09:30.430 --> 02:09:32.430
let our wives Yet once again,

2952
02:09:32.430 --> 02:09:33.800
to make us public sport,

2953
02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:36.400
Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,

2954
02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:38.330
Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.

2955
02:09:38.330 --> 02:09:40.430
There is no better way than that they spoke of.

2956
02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:41.670
How? to send him word

2957
02:09:41.670 --> 02:09:43.500
they'll meet him in the park at midnight?

2958
02:09:43.500 --> 02:09:45.130
Fie, fie! he'll never come.

2959
02:09:45.130 --> 02:09:47.570
You say he has been thrown in the rivers

2960
02:09:47.570 --> 02:09:50.700
and has been grievously peaten as an old 'oman:

2961
02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:52.000
methinks there should be terrors

2962
02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:53.930
in him that he should not come;

2963
02:09:53.930 --> 02:09:56.000
methinks his flesh is punished,

2964
02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:57.730
he shall have no desires.

2965
02:09:57.730 --> 02:09:58.930
So think I too.

2966
02:09:58.930 --> 02:10:00.270
Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,

2967
02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:03.900
And let us two devise to bring him thither.

2968
02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:08.030
There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,

2969
02:10:08.030 --> 02:10:10.670
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,

2970
02:10:10.670 --> 02:10:13.970
Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,

2971
02:10:13.970 --> 02:10:19.530
Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;

2972
02:10:19.530 --> 02:10:23.300
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle

2973
02:10:23.300 --> 02:10:28.300
And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain

2974
02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:31.430
In a most hideous and dreadful manner:

2975
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:32.570
You have heard of such a spirit,

2976
02:10:32.570 --> 02:10:34.530
and well you know the superstitious idle-headed eld

2977
02:10:34.530 --> 02:10:37.170
Received and did deliver to our age

2978
02:10:37.170 --> 02:10:39.430
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.

2979
02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:40.900
Why, yet there want not many

2980
02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:42.370
that do fear in deep of night

2981
02:10:42.370 --> 02:10:44.030
to walk by this Herne's oak:

2982
02:10:44.030 --> 02:10:45.170
But what of this?

2983
02:10:45.170 --> 02:10:46.630
Marry, this is our device;

2984
02:10:46.630 --> 02:10:49.470
That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.

2985
02:10:49.470 --> 02:10:52.730
Diguised like hern with huge horns on his head.

2986
02:10:52.730 --> 02:10:54.330
Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come:

2987
02:10:54.330 --> 02:10:56.130
And in this shape when you have brought him thither,

2988
02:10:56.130 --> 02:10:57.270
What shall be done with him?

2989
02:10:57.270 --> 02:10:58.330
what is your plot?

2990
02:10:58.330 --> 02:11:00.330
That also have we thought upon, and thus:

2991
02:11:00.330 --> 02:11:03.970
Nan Page my daughter and my little son

2992
02:11:03.970 --> 02:11:04.970
And three or four more

2993
02:11:04.970 --> 02:11:08.100
of their growth we'll dress like urchins,

2994
02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:10.270
ouphes and fairies, green and white,

2995
02:11:10.270 --> 02:11:13.030
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,

2996
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:14.870
And rattles in their hands:

2997
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:15.730
upon a sudden,

2998
02:11:15.730 --> 02:11:18.370
As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,

2999
02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:19.800
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once

3000
02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:22.730
With some diffused song:

3001
02:11:22.730 --> 02:11:23.600
upon their sight,

3002
02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:26.070
We two in great amazedness will fly:

3003
02:11:26.070 --> 02:11:28.330
Then let them all encircle him about

3004
02:11:28.330 --> 02:11:29.630
And, fairy-like,

3005
02:11:29.630 --> 02:11:32.130
to-pinch the unclean knight,

3006
02:11:32.130 --> 02:11:33.500
And ask him why,

3007
02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:35.000
that hour of fairy revel,

3008
02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.600
In their so sacred paths

3009
02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:37.730
he dares to tread

3010
02:11:37.730 --> 02:11:39.330
In shape profane.

3011
02:11:39.330 --> 02:11:40.870
And till he tell the truth,

3012
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:44.670
Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound

3013
02:11:44.670 --> 02:11:46.130
And burn him with their tapers.

3014
02:11:46.130 --> 02:11:47.230
The truth being known,

3015
02:11:47.230 --> 02:11:48.070
We'll all present ourselves,

3016
02:11:48.070 --> 02:11:49.300
dis-horn the spirit,

3017
02:11:49.300 --> 02:11:51.470
And mock him home to Windsor.

3018
02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:53.930
The children must be practised well

3019
02:11:53.930 --> 02:11:56.070
to this, or they'll ne'er do't.

3020
02:11:56.070 --> 02:11:58.370
I will teach the children their behaviors;

3021
02:11:58.370 --> 02:12:00.170
and I will be like a jack-an-apes

3022
02:12:00.170 --> 02:12:03.700
also, to burn the knight with my taber.

3023
02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:05.400
That will be excellent.

3024
02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:07.600
I'll go and buy them vizards.

3025
02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:10.870
My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,

3026
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:13.100
Finely attired in a robe of white.

3027
02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:14.930
That silk will I go buy.

3028
02:12:14.930 --> 02:12:18.570
And in that time

3029
02:12:18.570 --> 02:12:20.870
Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away

3030
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:22.670
And marry her at Eton.

3031
02:12:22.670 --> 02:12:24.470
Go send to Falstaff straight.

3032
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:29.330
Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook

3033
02:12:29.330 --> 02:12:31.030
He'll tell me all his purpose:

3034
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:32.270
sure, he'll come.

3035
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:33.170
Fear not you that.

3036
02:12:33.170 --> 02:12:34.070
Go get us properties

3037
02:12:34.070 --> 02:12:35.700
And tricking for our fairies.

3038
02:12:35.700 --> 02:12:36.700
Let us about it:

3039
02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:38.070
it is admirable pleasures

3040
02:12:38.070 --> 02:12:40.630
and fery honest knaveries.

3041
02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:51.070
Go, Mistress Ford,

3042
02:12:51.070 --> 02:12:52.230
Send quickly to Sir John,

3043
02:12:52.230 --> 02:12:56.400
to know his mind.

3044
02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:00.500
I'll to the doctor:

3045
02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:02.270
he hath my good will,

3046
02:13:02.270 --> 02:13:06.300
And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.

3047
02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:09.470
That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;

3048
02:13:09.470 --> 02:13:12.970
And he my husband best of all affects.

3049
02:13:12.970 --> 02:13:15.130
The doctor is well money'd,

3050
02:13:15.130 --> 02:13:17.670
and his friends potent at court:

3051
02:13:17.670 --> 02:13:20.330
he, none but he, shall have her,

3052
02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:25.700
Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.

3053
02:13:38.070 --> 02:13:40.270
What wouldst thou have, boor?

3054
02:13:40.270 --> 02:13:42.030
what: thick-skin?

3055
02:13:42.030 --> 02:13:47.330
speak, breathe, discuss;

3056
02:13:47.330 --> 02:13:49.070
brief, short, quick, snap.

3057
02:13:49.070 --> 02:13:50.030
Marry, sir, I come to speak

3058
02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:52.930
with Sir John Falstaff from Master Slender.

3059
02:13:52.930 --> 02:13:54.430
There's his chamber,

3060
02:13:54.430 --> 02:13:56.070
his house, his castle,

3061
02:13:56.070 --> 02:13:59.200
his standing-bed and truckle-bed;

3062
02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:00.130
'tis painted about

3063
02:14:00.130 --> 02:14:01.970
with the story of the Prodigal,

3064
02:14:01.970 --> 02:14:03.670
fresh and new.

3065
02:14:03.670 --> 02:14:06.730
Go knock and call;

3066
02:14:06.730 --> 02:14:11.100
hell speak like an Anthropophaginian

3067
02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:13.670
unto thee: knock, I say.

3068
02:14:13.670 --> 02:14:15.370
There's an old woman, a fat woman,

3069
02:14:15.370 --> 02:14:16.970
gone up into his chamber:

3070
02:14:16.970 --> 02:14:18.730
I'll be so bold as stay, sir,

3071
02:14:18.730 --> 02:14:20.470
till she come down;

3072
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:21.900
I come to speak with her, indeed.

3073
02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:26.530
Ha! a fat woman! the knight may be robbed:

3074
02:14:26.530 --> 02:14:28.700
I'll call. Bully knight!

3075
02:14:28.700 --> 02:14:30.770
bully Sir John!

3076
02:14:30.770 --> 02:14:34.300
speak from thy lungs military:

3077
02:14:34.700 --> 02:14:36.800
art thou there?

3078
02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:41.070
it is thine host, thine Ephesian, calls.

3079
02:14:41.070 --> 02:14:43.200
How now, mine host!

3080
02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:45.130
Here's a Bohemian-Tartar

3081
02:14:45.130 --> 02:14:46.200
tarries the coming down

3082
02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:47.800
of thy fat woman.

3083
02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:49.100
Let her descend, bully,

3084
02:14:49.100 --> 02:14:50.570
let her descend;

3085
02:14:50.570 --> 02:14:53.100
my chambers are honourable:

3086
02:14:53.100 --> 02:14:55.230
fie! privacy? fie!

3087
02:14:55.230 --> 02:14:56.530
There was, mine host,

3088
02:14:56.530 --> 02:14:59.070
an old fat woman even now with me;

3089
02:14:59.070 --> 02:15:00.330
but she's gone.

3090
02:15:00.330 --> 02:15:01.370
Pray you, sir,

3091
02:15:01.370 --> 02:15:05.870
was't not the wise woman ofBrentford?

3092
02:15:05.870 --> 02:15:08.070
Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell:

3093
02:15:08.070 --> 02:15:09.930
what would you with her?

3094
02:15:09.930 --> 02:15:12.430
My master, sir, Master Slender,

3095
02:15:12.430 --> 02:15:13.300
sent to her,

3096
02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:15.370
seeing her go through the streets,

3097
02:15:15.370 --> 02:15:18.370
to know, sir, whether one Nym, sir,

3098
02:15:18.370 --> 02:15:20.100
that beguiled him of a chain,

3099
02:15:20.100 --> 02:15:22.270
had the chain or no.

3100
02:15:22.270 --> 02:15:25.170
I spake with the old woman about it.

3101
02:15:25.170 --> 02:15:26.700
And what says she, I pray, sir?

3102
02:15:26.700 --> 02:15:28.970
Marry, she says that the very same man

3103
02:15:28.970 --> 02:15:30.900
that beguiled Master Slender

3104
02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:35.670
of his chain cozened him of it.

3105
02:15:38.370 --> 02:15:39.870
I would I could have spoken

3106
02:15:39.870 --> 02:15:41.300
with the woman herself;

3107
02:15:41.300 --> 02:15:42.930
I had other things to have spoken

3108
02:15:42.930 --> 02:15:44.970
with her too from him.

3109
02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:46.670
What are they? let us know.

3110
02:15:46.670 --> 02:15:48.030
Ay, come; quick.

3111
02:15:48.030 --> 02:15:50.230
I may not conceal them, sir.

3112
02:15:50.230 --> 02:15:54.800
Conceal them, or thou diest.

3113
02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:55.870
Why, sir, they were nothing

3114
02:15:55.870 --> 02:15:58.500
but about Mistress Anne Page;

3115
02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:00.670
to know if it were my master's fortune

3116
02:16:00.670 --> 02:16:02.600
to have her or no.

3117
02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:06.230
'Tis, 'tis his fortune.

3118
02:16:06.230 --> 02:16:08.000
What, sir?

3119
02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:11.100
To have her, or no.

3120
02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:15.830
Go; say the woman told me so.

3121
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:18.570
May I be bold to say so, sir?

3122
02:16:18.570 --> 02:16:21.130
Ay, sir; like who more bold.

3123
02:16:21.130 --> 02:16:22.570
I thank your worship:

3124
02:16:22.570 --> 02:16:29.900
I shall make my master glad with these tidings.

3125
02:16:43.170 --> 02:16:44.730
Thou art clerkly,

3126
02:16:44.730 --> 02:16:50.030
thou art clerkly, Sir John.

3127
02:16:50.570 --> 02:16:53.970
Was there a wise woman with thee?

3128
02:16:53.970 --> 02:16:56.470
Ay, that there was, mine host;

3129
02:16:56.470 --> 02:16:58.670
one that hath taught me more wit

3130
02:16:58.670 --> 02:17:00.930
than ever I learned before in my life;

3131
02:17:00.930 --> 02:17:02.530
and I paid nothing for it neither,

3132
02:17:02.530 --> 02:17:04.530
but was paid for my learning.

3133
02:17:04.530 --> 02:17:10.500
Out, alas, sir! cozenage, mere cozenage!

3134
02:17:10.500 --> 02:17:12.730
Where be my horses?

3135
02:17:12.730 --> 02:17:14.770
speak well of them, varletto.

3136
02:17:14.770 --> 02:17:16.470
Run away with the cozeners;

3137
02:17:16.470 --> 02:17:18.070
for so soon as I came beyond Eton,

3138
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:19.630
they threw me off from behind

3139
02:17:19.630 --> 02:17:22.800
one of them, in a slough of mire;

3140
02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:25.100
and set spurs and away,

3141
02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:27.930
like three German devils,

3142
02:17:27.930 --> 02:17:31.330
three Doctor Faustuses.

3143
02:17:31.330 --> 02:17:32.230
They are gone

3144
02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:34.600
but to meet the duke, villain:

3145
02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:36.030
do not say they be fled;

3146
02:17:36.030 --> 02:17:37.870
Germans are honest men.

3147
02:17:37.870 --> 02:17:39.530
Where is mine host?

3148
02:17:39.530 --> 02:17:41.500
What is the matter, sir?

3149
02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:44.470
Have a care of your entertainments:

3150
02:17:44.470 --> 02:17:45.570
there is a friend of mine

3151
02:17:45.570 --> 02:17:47.700
come to town tells me

3152
02:17:47.700 --> 02:17:49.900
there is three cozen-germans

3153
02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:51.400
that has cozened all the hosts

3154
02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:52.630
of Readins, of Maidenhead,

3155
02:17:52.630 --> 02:17:55.200
of Colebrook, of horses and money.

3156
02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:58.030
I tell you for good will, look you:

3157
02:17:58.030 --> 02:18:01.070
you are wise and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks,

3158
02:18:01.070 --> 02:18:02.130
and 'tis not convenient

3159
02:18:02.130 --> 02:18:04.330
you should be cozened. Fare you well.

3160
02:18:04.330 --> 02:18:06.070
Vere is mine host de Jarteer?

3161
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:07.030
Here, master doctor,

3162
02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:09.170
in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.

3163
02:18:09.170 --> 02:18:10.570
I cannot tell vat is dat:

3164
02:18:10.570 --> 02:18:12.170
but it is tell-a me dat

3165
02:18:12.170 --> 02:18:14.200

3166
02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:16.870
for a duke de Jamany:

3167
02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:19.570
by my trot, dere is no duke

3168
02:18:19.570 --> 02:18:21.530
dat the court is know to come.

3169
02:18:21.530 --> 02:18:25.030
I tell you for good vill: adieu.

3170
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:28.200
Hue and cry, villain, go!

3171
02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:29.930
Assist me, knight.

3172
02:18:29.930 --> 02:18:31.800
I amundone!

3173
02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:37.170
Fly, run, hue and cry, villain!

3174
02:18:37.170 --> 02:18:38.830
I am undone!

3175
02:18:38.830 --> 02:18:41.670
(laughing)

3176
02:18:56.770 --> 02:18:59.570
Now, whence come you?

3177
02:18:59.570 --> 02:19:01.770
From the two parties, forsooth.

3178
02:19:01.770 --> 02:19:03.430
The devil take one party

3179
02:19:03.430 --> 02:19:05.000
and his dam the other!

3180
02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.270
and so they shall be both bestowed.

3181
02:19:07.270 --> 02:19:10.030
I have suffered more for their sakes,

3182
02:19:10.030 --> 02:19:12.930
more than the villanous inconstancy

3183
02:19:12.930 --> 02:19:15.530
of man's disposition is able to bear.

3184
02:19:15.530 --> 02:19:17.270
And have not they suffered?

3185
02:19:17.270 --> 02:19:18.570
Yes, I warrant;

3186
02:19:18.570 --> 02:19:19.900
speciously one of them;

3187
02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:21.230
Mistress Ford, good heart,

3188
02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:22.930
is beaten black and blue,

3189
02:19:22.930 --> 02:19:24.730
that you cannot see a white spot about her.

3190
02:19:24.730 --> 02:19:27.500
What tellest thou me of black and blue?

3191
02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:28.330
I was beaten myself

3192
02:19:28.330 --> 02:19:30.630
into all the colours of the rainbow;

3193
02:19:30.630 --> 02:19:32.170
and I was like to be apprehended

3194
02:19:32.170 --> 02:19:34.570
for the witch of Brentford:

3195
02:19:34.570 --> 02:19:36.130
but that my admirable dexterity of wit,

3196
02:19:36.130 --> 02:19:38.730
my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,

3197
02:19:38.730 --> 02:19:40.930
protected me, the knave constable

3198
02:19:40.930 --> 02:19:42.430
had set me i' the stocks,

3199
02:19:42.430 --> 02:19:45.670
i' the common stocks, for a witch.

3200
02:19:45.670 --> 02:19:48.330
Sir, let me speak with you

3201
02:19:48.330 --> 02:19:49.630
in your chamber:

3202
02:19:49.630 --> 02:19:51.430
you shall hear how things go;

3203
02:19:51.430 --> 02:19:55.500
and, I warrant, to your content.

3204
02:19:55.500 --> 02:19:57.500
Here is a letter,

3205
02:19:57.500 --> 02:20:01.670
Good hearts, what ado here is to bring you together!

3206
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:03.330
Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well,

3207
02:20:03.330 --> 02:20:05.930
that you are so crossed.

3208
02:20:05.930 --> 02:20:10.070
Come up into my chamber.

3209
02:20:12.900 --> 02:20:15.500
Master Fenton, talk not to me;

3210
02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:17.330
my mind is heavy:

3211
02:20:17.330 --> 02:20:20.670
I have had a great loss. I will give over all.

3212
02:20:20.670 --> 02:20:22.030
Yet hear me speak.

3213
02:20:22.030 --> 02:20:23.730
Assist me in my purpose,

3214
02:20:23.730 --> 02:20:25.400
And, as I am a gentleman,

3215
02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:26.900
I'll give thee a hundred pound

3216
02:20:26.900 --> 02:20:30.470
in gold more than your loss.

3217
02:20:30.470 --> 02:20:32.330
I will hear you, Master Fenton;

3218
02:20:32.330 --> 02:20:34.730
and I will at the least keep your counsel.

3219
02:20:34.730 --> 02:20:36.830
From time to time I have acquainted you

3220
02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:39.070
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;

3221
02:20:39.070 --> 02:20:41.500
Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,

3222
02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:43.770
So far forth as herself might be her chooser,

3223
02:20:43.770 --> 02:20:45.070
Even to my wish:

3224
02:20:45.070 --> 02:20:46.970
I have a letter from her

3225
02:20:46.970 --> 02:20:49.300
Of such contents as you will wonder at;

3226
02:20:49.300 --> 02:20:51.970
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,

3227
02:20:51.970 --> 02:20:53.870
That neither singly can be manifested,

3228
02:20:53.870 --> 02:20:56.300
Without the show of both;

3229
02:20:56.300 --> 02:21:00.200
fat Falstaff hath a great scene:

3230
02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:01.170
the image of the jest

3231
02:21:01.170 --> 02:21:02.300
I'll show you here at large.

3232
02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:06.370
Hark, good mine host.

3233
02:21:06.370 --> 02:21:08.630
To-night at Herne's oak,

3234
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:10.330
just 'twixt twelve and one,

3235
02:21:10.330 --> 02:21:12.870
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;

3236
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:15.200
The purpose why, is here:

3237
02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:16.370
in which disguise,

3238
02:21:16.370 --> 02:21:17.800
While other jests

3239
02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:19.570
are something rank on foot,

3240
02:21:19.570 --> 02:21:21.430
Her father hath commanded her

3241
02:21:21.430 --> 02:21:22.730
to slip away with Slender

3242
02:21:22.730 --> 02:21:23.800
and with him at Eton

3243
02:21:23.800 --> 02:21:25.170
Immediately to marry:

3244
02:21:25.170 --> 02:21:26.370
she hath consented:

3245
02:21:26.370 --> 02:21:27.670
Now, sir, Her mother,

3246
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:29.230
ever strong against that match

3247
02:21:29.230 --> 02:21:30.670
And firm for Doctor Caius,

3248
02:21:30.670 --> 02:21:32.000
hath appointed

3249
02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.430
that he shall likewise shuffle her away,

3250
02:21:34.430 --> 02:21:35.430
While other sports

3251
02:21:35.430 --> 02:21:37.030
are tasking of their minds,

3252
02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:38.100
And at the deanery,

3253
02:21:38.100 --> 02:21:39.130
where a priest attends,

3254
02:21:39.130 --> 02:21:41.030
Straight marry her:

3255
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:42.770
to this her mother's plot

3256
02:21:42.770 --> 02:21:44.000
She seemingly obedient likewise hath

3257
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:45.530
Made promise to the doctor.

3258
02:21:45.530 --> 02:21:47.300
Now, thus it rests:

3259
02:21:47.300 --> 02:21:50.200
Her father means she shall be all in white,

3260
02:21:50.200 --> 02:21:51.270
And in that habit,

3261
02:21:51.270 --> 02:21:52.430
when Slender sees his time

3262
02:21:52.430 --> 02:21:53.730
To take her by the hand

3263
02:21:53.730 --> 02:21:54.470
and bid her go,

3264
02:21:54.470 --> 02:21:56.030
She shall go with him:

3265
02:21:56.030 --> 02:21:57.430
her mother hath intended,

3266
02:21:57.430 --> 02:21:58.930
The better to denote her to the doctor,

3267
02:21:58.930 --> 02:22:01.130
For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,

3268
02:22:01.130 --> 02:22:03.170
That quaint in green

3269
02:22:03.170 --> 02:22:04.570
she shall be loose enrobed,

3270
02:22:04.570 --> 02:22:05.800
With ribands pendent,

3271
02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:07.100
flaring 'bout her head;

3272
02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:09.300
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,

3273
02:22:09.300 --> 02:22:10.300
To pinch her by the hand,

3274
02:22:10.300 --> 02:22:11.270
and, on that token,

3275
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:13.470
The maid hath given consent to go with him.

3276
02:22:13.470 --> 02:22:15.930
Which means she to deceive, father or mother?

3277
02:22:15.930 --> 02:22:19.730
Both, my good host, to go along with me:

3278
02:22:19.730 --> 02:22:21.870
And here it rests,

3279
02:22:21.870 --> 02:22:23.500
that you'll procure the vicar

3280
02:22:23.500 --> 02:22:24.630
To stay for me at church

3281
02:22:24.630 --> 02:22:25.930
'twixt twelve and one,

3282
02:22:25.930 --> 02:22:26.970
And, in the lawful name of marrying,

3283
02:22:26.970 --> 02:22:29.400
To give our hearts united ceremony.

3284
02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:31.830
Well, husband your device;

3285
02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:33.070
I'll to the vicar:

3286
02:22:33.070 --> 02:22:34.530
Bring you the maid,

3287
02:22:34.530 --> 02:22:36.470
you shall not lack a priest.

3288
02:22:36.470 --> 02:22:39.270
So shall I evermore be bound to thee;

3289
02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:42.430
Besides, I'll make a present recompense.

3290
02:22:42.830 --> 02:22:47.630
(♪ music)

3291
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:50.200
This is the third time;

3292
02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:53.330
I hope good luck lies in odd numbers.

3293
02:22:53.330 --> 02:22:56.330
Away I go.

3294
02:22:56.330 --> 02:22:58.830
They say there is divinity in odd numbers,

3295
02:22:58.830 --> 02:23:04.330
either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!

3296
02:23:05.670 --> 02:23:08.170
I'll provide you a chain;

3297
02:23:08.170 --> 02:23:09.430
and I'll do what I can

3298
02:23:09.430 --> 02:23:12.070
to get you a pair of horns.

3299
02:23:12.070 --> 02:23:15.630
Away, I say; time wears:

3300
02:23:15.630 --> 02:23:19.630
hold up your head, and mince.

3301
02:23:27.930 --> 02:23:29.930
How now, Master Brook!

3302
02:23:29.930 --> 02:23:31.700
Master Brook,

3303
02:23:31.700 --> 02:23:35.300
the matter will be known to-night, or never.

3304
02:23:35.300 --> 02:23:37.100
Be you in the park about midnight,

3305
02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:39.370
at Herne's oak, and you shall see wonders.

3306
02:23:39.370 --> 02:23:41.300
Went you not to her this morning, sir,

3307
02:23:41.300 --> 02:23:43.000
as you told me you had appointed?

3308
02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:44.930
I went to her, Master Brook,

3309
02:23:44.930 --> 02:23:48.700
as you see, like a poor old man:

3310
02:23:48.700 --> 02:23:50.470
but I came from her, Master Brook,

3311
02:23:50.470 --> 02:23:53.100
like a poor old woman.

3312
02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:57.470
That same knave Ford, her husband,

3313
02:23:57.470 --> 02:23:59.070
hath the finest mad devil

3314
02:23:59.070 --> 02:24:00.100
of jealousy in him,

3315
02:24:00.100 --> 02:24:02.330
Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy.

3316
02:24:02.330 --> 02:24:04.600
I will tell you: he beat me grievously,

3317
02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:06.030
in the shape of a woman;

3318
02:24:06.030 --> 02:24:07.670
for in the shape of man, Master Brook,

3319
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:09.930
I fear not Goliath with a weaver's beam;

3320
02:24:09.930 --> 02:24:11.130
I am in haste; go along with me:

3321
02:24:11.130 --> 02:24:15.300
I'll tell you all.

3322
02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:17.470
Since I plucked geese,

3323
02:24:17.470 --> 02:24:19.600
played truant and whipped top,

3324
02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:20.400
I knew not what 'twas

3325
02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:22.630
to be beaten till lately.

3326
02:24:22.630 --> 02:24:25.230
Follow me: I'll tell you strange things

3327
02:24:25.230 --> 02:24:27.730
of this knave Ford, on whom to-night

3328
02:24:27.730 --> 02:24:29.670
I will be revenged,

3329
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:32.000
and I will deliver his wife

3330
02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
into your hand. Follow.

3331
02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:40.470
Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.

3332
02:24:51.130 --> 02:24:55.030
Come, come;

3333
02:24:55.730 --> 02:24:57.630
we'll couch i' the castle-ditch

3334
02:24:57.630 --> 02:24:59.670
till we see the light of our fairies.

3335
02:24:59.670 --> 02:25:02.030
Remember, son Slender,my daughter.

3336
02:25:02.030 --> 02:25:03.870
Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her

3337
02:25:03.870 --> 02:25:05.100
and we have a nay-word how

3338
02:25:05.100 --> 02:25:06.300
to know one another:

3339
02:25:06.300 --> 02:25:08.770
I come to her in white, and cry 'mum;'

3340
02:25:08.770 --> 02:25:10.800
she cries 'budget;'

3341
02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:13.100
and by that we know one another.

3342
02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:14.770
That's good too:

3343
02:25:14.770 --> 02:25:17.270
but what needs either your 'mum'

3344
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:19.200
or her 'budget?'

3345
02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:23.100
the white will decipher her well enough.

3346
02:25:23.100 --> 02:25:25.330
It hath struck ten o'clock.

3347
02:25:25.330 --> 02:25:27.070
The night is dark;

3348
02:25:27.070 --> 02:25:29.030
light and spirits will become it well.

3349
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:31.430
Heaven prosper our sport!

3350
02:25:31.430 --> 02:25:33.370
No man means evil but the devil,

3351
02:25:33.370 --> 02:25:35.030
and we shall know him by his horns.

3352
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:39.130
Let's away; follow me.

3353
02:25:47.870 --> 02:25:50.630
Master doctor, my daughter is in green:

3354
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:52.130
when you see your time,

3355
02:25:52.130 --> 02:25:53.070
take her by the band,

3356
02:25:53.070 --> 02:25:54.170
away with her to the deanery,

3357
02:25:54.170 --> 02:25:55.270
and dispatch it quickly.

3358
02:25:55.270 --> 02:25:56.370
Go before into the Park:

3359
02:25:56.370 --> 02:25:58.370
we two must go together.

3360
02:25:58.370 --> 02:26:04.170
I know vat I have to do. Adieu.

3361
02:26:06.930 --> 02:26:09.630
Fare you well, sir.

3362
02:26:09.630 --> 02:26:12.000
My husband will not rejoice so much

3363
02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:13.830
at the abuse of Falstaff

3364
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:15.230
as he will chafe at the doctor's

3365
02:26:15.230 --> 02:26:17.330
marrying my daughter:

3366
02:26:17.330 --> 02:26:19.200
but 'tis no matter;

3367
02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:20.430
better a little chiding

3368
02:26:20.430 --> 02:26:22.270
than a great deal of heart-break.

3369
02:26:22.270 --> 02:26:25.870
Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies,

3370
02:26:25.870 --> 02:26:27.530
and the Welsh devil Hugh?

3371
02:26:27.530 --> 02:26:28.400
They are all couched

3372
02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:31.330
in a pit hard by Herne's oak,

3373
02:26:31.330 --> 02:26:32.370
with obscured lights;

3374
02:26:32.370 --> 02:26:33.930
which, at the very instant of Falstaff's

3375
02:26:33.930 --> 02:26:34.870
and our meeting,

3376
02:26:34.870 --> 02:26:36.600
they will at once display to the night.

3377
02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:38.370
That cannot choose but amaze him.

3378
02:26:38.370 --> 02:26:41.470
If he be not amazed, he will be mocked;

3379
02:26:41.470 --> 02:26:43.600
if he be amazed, he will every way be mocked.

3380
02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:45.330
We'll betray him finely.

3381
02:26:45.330 --> 02:26:47.970
Against such lewdsters and their lechery

3382
02:26:47.970 --> 02:26:50.470
Those that betray them do no treachery.

3383
02:26:51.130 --> 02:26:56.270
The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!

3384
02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:09.470
Trib, trib, fairies; come;

3385
02:27:09.470 --> 02:27:12.330
and remember your parts: Trib.

3386
02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:28.070
be pold, I pray you; follow me into the pit;

3387
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:29.870
and when I give the watch-'ords,

3388
02:27:29.870 --> 02:27:32.130
do as I pid you:

3389
02:27:32.130 --> 02:27:38.870
come, come; trib, trib.

3390
02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:08.900
The Windsor bell hath struck twelve;

3391
02:28:08.900 --> 02:28:11.470
the minute draws on.

3392
02:28:11.470 --> 02:28:14.700
Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me!

3393
02:28:14.700 --> 02:28:17.230
Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull

3394
02:28:17.230 --> 02:28:18.500
for thy Europa;

3395
02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:21.900
love set on thy horns.

3396
02:28:21.900 --> 02:28:23.170
O powerful love! that,

3397
02:28:23.170 --> 02:28:25.270
in some respects, makes a a man a beast,

3398
02:28:25.270 --> 02:28:29.470
in some other, a beast a man.

3399
02:28:29.470 --> 02:28:31.570
When gods have hot backs,

3400
02:28:31.570 --> 02:28:34.000
what shall poor men do?

3401
02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:39.370
For me, I am here a Windsor stag;

3402
02:28:39.370 --> 02:28:40.100
and the fattest,

3403
02:28:40.100 --> 02:28:43.200
I think, i' the forest.

3404
02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:47.030
Send me a cool rut-time, Jove,

3405
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:51.500
or who can blame me to piss my tallow?

3406
02:28:51.500 --> 02:28:55.570
Who comes here? my doe?

3407
02:28:55.570 --> 02:28:59.230
My deer? my male deer?

3408
02:28:59.230 --> 02:29:01.870
My doe with the black scut!

3409
02:29:01.870 --> 02:29:05.030
Let the sky rain potatoes;

3410
02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:07.370
let it thunder to the tune of Green Sleeves,

3411
02:29:07.370 --> 02:29:11.230
hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes;

3412
02:29:11.230 --> 02:29:13.770
let there come a tempest of provocation,

3413
02:29:13.770 --> 02:29:16.570
I will shelter me here.

3414
02:29:16.570 --> 02:29:20.930
Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.

3415
02:29:25.070 --> 02:29:29.900
Divide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch:

3416
02:29:31.930 --> 02:29:34.630
I will keep my sides to myself,

3417
02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:37.430
my shoulders for the fellow of this walk,

3418
02:29:37.430 --> 02:29:41.770
and my horns I bequeath your husbands.

3419
02:29:41.770 --> 02:29:42.930
Am I a woodman, ha?

3420
02:29:42.930 --> 02:29:46.400
Speak I like Herne the hunter?

3421
02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:47.970
Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience;

3422
02:29:47.970 --> 02:29:50.030
he makes restitution.

3423
02:29:50.030 --> 02:29:53.300
As I am a true spirit, welcome!

3424
02:29:53.300 --> 02:29:56.170
(♪ horns)

3425
02:29:56.170 --> 02:29:57.330
Alas, what noise?

3426
02:29:57.330 --> 02:29:58.600
Heaven forgive our sins

3427
02:29:58.600 --> 02:30:01.900
What should this be?

3428
02:30:01.900 --> 02:30:04.200
Away, away!

3429
02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:12.670
I think the devil will not have me damned,

3430
02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:14.600
lest the oil that's in me

3431
02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:16.500
should set hell on fire;

3433
02:30:37.300 --> 02:30:39.900
Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,

3434
02:30:39.900 --> 02:30:42.970
You moonshine revellers and shades of night,

3435
02:30:42.970 --> 02:30:45.730
You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,

3436
02:30:45.730 --> 02:30:49.430
Attend your office and your quality.

3437
02:30:49.430 --> 02:30:51.930
Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.

3438
02:30:51.930 --> 02:30:54.470
Elves, list your names;

3439
02:30:54.470 --> 02:30:58.300
silence, you airy toys.

3440
02:30:58.300 --> 02:31:01.630
Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:

3441
02:31:01.630 --> 02:31:02.930
Where fires thou find'st unraked

3442
02:31:02.930 --> 02:31:04.730
and hearths unswept,

3443
02:31:04.730 --> 02:31:07.530
There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry:

3444
02:31:07.530 --> 02:31:12.300
Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.

3445
02:31:12.300 --> 02:31:14.070
They are fairies;

3446
02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:17.000
he that speaks to them shall die:

3447
02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:18.770
I'll wink and couch:

3448
02:31:18.770 --> 02:31:21.870
no man their works must eye.

3449
02:31:21.870 --> 02:31:23.100

3450
02:31:23.100 --> 02:31:23.900
Here!

3451
02:31:23.900 --> 02:31:26.400
Go you, and where you find a maid

3452
02:31:26.400 --> 02:31:28.000
That, ere she sleep,

3453
02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:29.900
has thrice her prayers said,

3454
02:31:29.900 --> 02:31:32.900
Raise up the organs of her fantasy;

3455
02:31:32.900 --> 02:31:37.000
Sleep she as sound as careless infancy:

3456
02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:40.400
But those as sleep and think not on their sins,

3457
02:31:40.400 --> 02:31:41.970
Pinch them, arms, legs, backs,

3458
02:31:41.970 --> 02:31:43.430
shoulders, sides and shins.

3459
02:31:43.430 --> 02:31:44.200
Where's Pede?

3460
02:31:44.200 --> 02:31:47.470
Here!

3461
02:31:47.470 --> 02:31:49.530
Go you and see where Brokers sleep.

3462
02:31:49.530 --> 02:31:51.930
and foxide servants with their mace.

3463
02:31:51.930 --> 02:31:53.770
Go lay the proctors in the streets,

3464
02:31:53.770 --> 02:31:56.530
and pinch the lousy servants face,

3465
02:31:56.530 --> 02:31:58.130
spare none of these when there abed,

3466
02:31:58.130 --> 02:32:02.100
but such whose nose looks blue and red.

02:32:02.400 --> 02:32:03.900
About, about;

3470
02:32:06.930 --> 02:32:10.430
Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:

3471
02:32:10.430 --> 02:32:13.470
That it may stand till the perpetual doom,

3472
02:32:13.470 --> 02:32:17.070
In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,

3473
02:32:17.070 --> 02:32:19.330
Worthy the owner, and the owner it.

3474
02:32:19.330 --> 02:32:26.200
Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,

3475
02:32:26.200 --> 02:32:28.200
Our dance of custom round about the oak

3476
02:32:28.200 --> 02:32:30.730
Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.

3477
02:32:30.730 --> 02:32:32.830
Pray you, lock hand in hand;

3478
02:32:32.830 --> 02:32:35.570
yourselves in order set

3479
02:32:35.570 --> 02:32:39.430
And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,

3480
02:32:39.430 --> 02:32:42.630
To guide our measure round about the tree.

3481
02:32:42.630 --> 02:32:51.730
But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.

3482
02:32:54.370 --> 02:32:56.670
Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy,

3483
02:32:56.670 --> 02:32:58.870
lest he transform me to a piece of cheese!

3484
02:32:58.870 --> 02:33:01.170
Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd

3485
02:33:01.170 --> 02:33:02.470
even in thy birth.

3486
02:33:02.470 --> 02:33:04.800
With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:

3487
02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:07.130
If he be chaste, the flame will back descend

3488
02:33:07.130 --> 02:33:10.030
And turn him to no pain; but if he start,

3489
02:33:10.030 --> 02:33:12.600
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.

3490
02:33:12.600 --> 02:33:14.100
A trial, come.

3491
02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:17.270
Come, will this wood take fire?

3492
02:33:17.270 --> 02:33:20.030
Oh, Oh, Oh!

3493
02:33:20.030 --> 02:33:22.870
Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!

3494
02:33:22.870 --> 02:33:25.770
About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;

3495
02:33:25.770 --> 02:33:26.570
And, as you trip,

3496
02:33:26.570 --> 02:33:31.170

Now, sir, who's a cuckold now?

3522
02:36:46.470 --> 02:36:47.430
Master Brook,

3523
02:36:47.430 --> 02:36:50.070
Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave;

3524
02:36:50.070 --> 02:36:52.870
here are his horns, Master Brook:

3525
02:36:52.870 --> 02:36:54.470
and, Master Brook,

3526
02:36:54.470 --> 02:36:56.070
he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford's

3527
02:36:56.070 --> 02:36:58.570
but his buck-basket,

3528
02:36:58.570 --> 02:37:00.930
his cudgel, and twenty pounds of money,

3529
02:37:00.930 --> 02:37:03.300
which must be paid to Master Brook;

3530

Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet.

3532
02:37:14.100 --> 02:37:15.700
I will never take you for my love again;

3533
02:37:15.700 --> 02:37:18.270
but I will always count you my deer.

3534
02:37:21.570 --> 02:37:24.070
I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.

3535
02:37:24.070 --> 02:37:27.100
Ay, and an ox too:

3536
02:37:27.100 --> 02:37:31.530
both the proofs are extant.

3537
02:37:31.530 --> 02:37:35.130
And these are not fairies?

(laughing)

3539
02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:41.330
I was three or four times in the thought

3540
02:37:41.330 --> 02:37:42.930
they were not fairies:

3541
02:37:42.930 --> 02:37:45.900
and yet the guiltiness of my mind,

3542
02:37:45.900 --> 02:37:48.130
the sudden surprise of my powers,

3543
02:37:48.130 --> 02:37:50.070
drove the grossness of the foppery

3544
02:37:50.070 --> 02:37:51.970
into a received belief,

3545
02:37:51.970 --> 02:37:52.830
in despite of the teeth

3546
02:37:52.830 --> 02:37:54.070
of all rhyme and reason,

3547
02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:56.400
that they were fairies.

3548
02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:57.900
See now how wit may be made

02:37:57.900 --> 02:37:58.800

3552
02:38:04.630 --> 02:38:06.730
and leave your desires,

02:38:06.730 --> 02:38:08.630
and fairies will not pinse you.

3554
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:11.030
Well said, fairy Hugh.

3555
02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:15.330
And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.

3556
02:38:15.330 --> 02:38:17.330
I will never mistrust my wife again

3557
02:38:17.330 --> 02:38:20.800
till thou art able to woo her in good English.

3558
02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:25.700
Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it,

3559
02:38:25.700 --> 02:38:26.700
that it wants matter

3560
02:38:26.700 --> 02:38:30.000
to prevent so gross o'erreaching as this?

3561
02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.970
Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too?

3562
02:38:32.970 --> 02:38:34.770
shall I have a coxcomb of frize?

02:38:34.770 --> 02:38:36.470

Seese is not good to give putter;

'Seese' and 'putter'!

3568
02:38:44.130 --> 02:38:47.870
have I lived to stand at the taunt

3569
02:38:47.870 --> 02:38:50.730
of one that makes fritters of English?

3570
02:38:50.730 --> 02:38:52.030
This is enough to be the decay

3571
02:38:52.030 --> 02:38:54.430

3572
02:38:54.430 --> 02:38:56.400
Why Sir John, do you think,

3573
02:38:56.400 --> 02:38:58.430
though we would have thrust virtue

3574
02:38:58.430 --> 02:39:00.300
out of our hearts by the head and shoulders

3575
02:39:00.300 --> 02:39:01.200
and have given ourselves

3576
02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:03.330
without scruple to hell,

3577
02:39:03.330 --> 02:39:04.330
that ever the devil

3578
02:39:04.330 --> 02:39:06.130
could have made you our delight?

3579
02:39:06.130 --> 02:39:10.970
What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?

3580
02:39:10.970 --> 02:39:12.400
A puffed man?

3581
02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:16.970
Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?

3582
02:39:16.970 --> 02:39:18.870
And one that is as slanderous as Satan?

3583
02:39:18.870 --> 02:39:19.870
And as poor as Job?

3584
02:39:19.870 --> 02:39:21.570
And as wicked as his wife?

3585
02:39:21.570 --> 02:39:24.070
And given to fornications,

3586
02:39:24.070 --> 02:39:25.700
and to taverns and sack

3587
02:39:25.700 --> 02:39:27.800
and wine and metheglins,

3588
02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:28.970
and to drinkings and

3589
02:39:28.970 --> 02:39:33.600
swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?

3590
02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:36.130
Well, I am your theme:

3591
02:39:36.130 --> 02:39:37.500

3592
02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:40.670

3593
02:39:40.670 --> 02:39:43.500
I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel;

3594
02:39:43.500 --> 02:39:45.730
ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me:

3595
02:39:45.730 --> 02:39:47.930
use me as you will.

3596
02:39:47.930 --> 02:39:49.130
Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor,

3597
02:39:49.130 --> 02:39:50.230
to one Master Brook,

3598
02:39:50.230 --> 02:39:51.700
that you have cozened of money,

3599
02:39:51.700 --> 02:39:53.430
to whom you should have been a pander:

3600
02:39:53.430 --> 02:39:55.700
over and above that you have suffered,

3601
02:39:55.700 --> 02:39:57.170
I think to repay that money

3602
02:39:57.170 --> 02:39:59.470
will be a biting affliction.

3603
02:39:59.470 --> 02:40:00.770
Nay good husband.

3604
02:40:00.770 --> 02:40:04.070
Let that go to make amends. Forget that sum.

3605
02:40:04.070 --> 02:40:05.930
Then we'll all be friends.

3606
02:40:05.930 --> 02:40:08.230
Yet be cheerful, knight:

3607
02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:10.130
thou shalt eat a posset to-night at my house;

3608
02:40:10.130 --> 02:40:13.370
where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife,

3609
02:40:13.370 --> 02:40:15.170
that now laughs at thee:

3610
02:40:15.170 --> 02:40:19.200
tell her Master Slender hath married her daughter.

3611
02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:21.870
Doctors doubt that:

3612
02:40:21.870 --> 02:40:23.330
if Anne Page be my daughter,

3613
02:40:23.330 --> 02:40:25.700
she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.

3614
02:40:25.700 --> 02:40:28.000
Whoa ho! ho, father Page!

3615
02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.600
Son, how now! how now, son!

3616
02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:31.630
have you dispatched?

3617
02:40:31.630 --> 02:40:32.770
Dispatched!

3618
02:40:32.770 --> 02:40:34.370
I'll make the best in Gloucestershire know on't;

3619
02:40:34.370 --> 02:40:36.500
would I were hanged, la, else.

3620
02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:37.430
Of what, son?

3621
02:40:37.430 --> 02:40:38.530
I came yonder at Eton

3622
02:40:38.530 --> 02:40:40.130
to marry Mistress Anne Page,

3623
02:40:40.130 --> 02:40:42.500
and she's a great lubberly boy.

3624
02:40:42.500 --> 02:40:44.130
If it had not been i' the church,

3625
02:40:44.130 --> 02:40:45.700
I would have swinged him,

3626
02:40:45.700 --> 02:40:47.270
or he should have swinged me.

3627
02:40:47.270 --> 02:40:48.600
If I did not think it had been Anne Page,

3628
02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:49.970
would I might never stir!

3629
02:40:49.970 --> 02:40:52.170
--and 'tis a postmaster's boy.

3630
02:40:52.170 --> 02:40:56.330
Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.

3631
02:40:56.330 --> 02:40:58.000
What need you tell me that?

3632
02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:01.170
I think so, when I took a boy for a girl.

3633
02:41:01.170 --> 02:41:02.670
If I had been married to him,

3634
02:41:02.670 --> 02:41:03.970
for all he was in woman's apparel,

3635
02:41:03.970 --> 02:41:06.030
I would not have had him.

3636
02:41:06.030 --> 02:41:07.370
Why, this is your own folly.

3637
02:41:07.370 --> 02:41:08.530
Did not I tell you how

3638
02:41:08.530 --> 02:41:10.800
you should know my daughter by her garments?

3639
02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:13.800
I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,'

3640
02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:15.130
and she cried 'budget,'

3641
02:41:15.130 --> 02:41:16.730
as Anne and I had appointed;

3642
02:41:16.730 --> 02:41:21.900
and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.

3643
02:41:21.900 --> 02:41:24.670
Good George, be not angry:

3644
02:41:24.670 --> 02:41:25.970
I knew of your purpose;

3645
02:41:25.970 --> 02:41:28.130
turned my daughter into green;

3646
02:41:28.130 --> 02:41:29.470
and, indeed, she is now with the doctor

3647
02:41:29.470 --> 02:41:32.030
at the deanery, and there married.

3648
02:41:32.030 --> 02:41:34.130
Vere is Mistress Page?

3649
02:41:34.130 --> 02:41:36.500
By gar, I am cozened:

3650
02:41:36.500 --> 02:41:39.670
I ha' married un garcon, a boy;

3651
02:41:39.670 --> 02:41:43.400
un paysan, by gar, a boy;

3652
02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:48.130
it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.

3653
02:41:48.130 --> 02:41:49.600
Why, did you take her in green?

3654
02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:54.800
Ay, by gar, and 'tis a garson, jacque boy:

3655
02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:58.600
by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.

3656
02:42:02.830 --> 02:42:10.130
This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?

3657
02:42:10.130 --> 02:42:16.930
My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.

3658
02:42:16.930 --> 02:42:19.670
How now, Master Fenton!

3659
02:42:19.670 --> 02:42:24.000
Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!

3660
02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:25.270
Now, mistress,

3661
02:42:25.270 --> 02:42:27.870
how chance you went not with Master Slender?

3662
02:42:27.870 --> 02:42:30.100
Why went you not with master doctor, maid?

3663
02:42:30.100 --> 02:42:34.530
You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.

3664
02:42:34.530 --> 02:42:36.830
You would have married her most shamefully,

3665
02:42:36.830 --> 02:42:38.970
Where there was no proportion held in love.

3666
02:42:38.970 --> 02:42:40.700
The truth is, she and I,

3667
02:42:40.700 --> 02:42:42.400
long since contracted,

3668
02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:47.130
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.

3669
02:42:49.100 --> 02:42:51.770
The offence is holy that she hath committed;

3670
02:42:51.770 --> 02:42:54.330
And this deceit loses the name of craft,

3671
02:42:54.330 --> 02:42:57.830
Of disobedience, or unduteous title,

3672
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:59.400
Since therein she doth evitate and shun

3673
02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:02.530
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,

3674
02:43:02.530 --> 02:43:03.370
Which forced marriage

3675
02:43:03.370 --> 02:43:08.370
would have brought upon her.

3676
02:43:08.370 --> 02:43:14.800
Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:

3677
02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:17.570
In love the heavens themselves

3678
02:43:17.570 --> 02:43:19.830
do guide the state;

3679
02:43:19.830 --> 02:43:28.400
Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.

3680
02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:29.570
I am glad,

3681
02:43:29.570 --> 02:43:32.430
though you have ta'en a special stand to strike at me,

3682
02:43:32.430 --> 02:43:36.670
that your arrow hath glanced.

3683
02:43:36.670 --> 02:43:42.970
Well, what remedy?

3684
02:43:42.970 --> 02:43:49.270
Fenton, heaven give thee joy!

3685
02:43:49.270 --> 02:43:54.400
What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.

3686
02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:55.670
When night-dogs run,

3687
02:43:55.670 --> 02:43:59.830
all sorts of deer are chased.

3688
02:43:59.830 --> 02:44:02.800
Well, I will muse no further.

3689
02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:04.330
Master Fenton,

3690
02:44:04.330 --> 02:44:09.530
Heaven give you many, many merry days!

3691
02:44:11.630 --> 02:44:16.770
I also will dance and eat plums at your wedding.

3692
02:44:16.770 --> 02:44:19.670
Good husband, let us every one go home,

3693
02:44:19.670 --> 02:44:23.500
And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;

3694
02:44:23.500 --> 02:44:26.070
Sir John and all.

3695
02:44:28.970 --> 02:44:32.300
Let it be so. Sir John,

3696
02:44:32.300 --> 02:44:35.530
To Master Brook you yet shall keep your word

3697
02:44:35.530 --> 02:44:42.430
For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.

3698
02:44:55.200 --> 02:45:05.200
(♪singing)

3699
02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:50.000


3700
02:47:51.100 --> 02:47:54.100
