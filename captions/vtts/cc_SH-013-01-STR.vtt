00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:53.430


2
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.700
Tranio,

3
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.170
since for the great desire I had

4
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.830
to see fair Padua, nursery of arts,

5
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.170
I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy, the pleasant garden of great Italy;

6
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.100
and by my father's love and leave am arm'd

7
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.970
with his good will and thy good company,

8
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.930
my trusty servant, well-approved in all,

9
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.800
here let us breathe and haply institute

10
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.870
a course of learning and ingenious studies.

11
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.430
Pisa renown'd for grave citizens

12
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.170
gave me my being and my father first,

13
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.370
a merchant of great traffic through the world,

14
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.970
Vincetino come of Bentivolii.

15
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.900
Vincetino's son brought up in Florence,

16
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.030
it shall become to serve all hopes conceived,

17
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.100
to deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.

18
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.170
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,

19
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.830
virtue and that part of philosophy

20
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.200
will I apply that treats of happiness by virtue specially to be achieved.

21
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.400
Well, tell me thy mind,

22
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.230
for I have Pisa left and am to Padua come

23
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.830
as he that leaves a shallow plash to plunge him in the deep

24
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.900
and with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.

25
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.600
Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,

26
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.870
I am in all affected as yourself,

27
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.870
glad that you thus resolve

28
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.000
to suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.

29
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.200
Only, good master, while we do admire

30
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.500
this virtue and this moral discipline,

31
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.800
let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray,

32
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.830
or so devote to Aristotle's cheques

33
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.600
as Ovid be an outcast quite abjured.

34
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.030
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have

35
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.300
and practise rhetoric in your common talk.

36
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.470
Music and poesy use to quicken you.

37
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.070
The mathematics and metaphysics,

38
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.670
fall to them as you find your stomach serves you.

39
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.630
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en.

40
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.830
In brief, sir, study what you most affect.

41
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.600
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.

42
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.930
If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,

43
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.700
we could at once put us in readiness--

44
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.800
ow--

45
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.500
and take a lodging fit to entertain

46
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.670
such friends as time in Padua shall beget.

47
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.770
But stay a while.

48
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.900
What company is this?

49
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.330
Master, some show to welcome us to town.

50
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.630
Gentlemen, importune me no farther,

51
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.970
for how I firmly am resolved you know;

52
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.830
that is, not bestow my youngest daughter

53
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.730
before I have a husband for the elder.

54
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.530
If either of you both love Katharina,

55
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.470
because I know you well and love you well,

56
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.800
leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.

57
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.900
To cart her rather.

58
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.370
She's too rough for me.

59
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.570
There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?

60
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.770
I pray you, sir, is it your will

61
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.500
to make a stale of me amongst these mates?

62
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.630
Mates, maid, how mean you that?

63
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.800
No mates for you

64
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.170
unless you were of gentler, milder mold.

65
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.470
I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear.

66
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.000
I wis it is not halfway to her heart,

67
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.900
but if it were, doubt not her care should be

68
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.730
to comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool

69
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.730
and paint your face and use you like a fool.

70
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.400
From all such devils, good Lord deliver us.

71
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.930
And me too, good Lord.

72
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.630
Hush, master.

73
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.230
Here's some good pastime toward.

74
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.700
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.

75
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.970
But in the other's silence

76
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.070
do I see maid's mild behavior and sobriety.

77
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.430
Peace, Tranio.

78
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.200
Gentlemen, that I may soon make good what I have said--

79
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.870
Bianca, get you in,

80
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.630
and let it not displease thee, good Bianca,

81
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.670
for I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.

82
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.300
A pretty peat.

83
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.130
It is best put finger in the eye,

84
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.230
an she knew why.

85
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.070
Sister, content you in my discontent.

86
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.230
Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe.

87
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.870
My books and instruments shall be my company,

88
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.570
on them to look and practise by myself.

89
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.300
Hark, Tranio, thou may'st hear Minerva speak.

90
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.570
Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?

91
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.570
Sorry am I that our good will effects Bianca's grief.

92
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.770
Why will you mew her up, Signior Baptista,

93
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.000
for this fiend of hell,

94
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.500
and make her bear the penance of her tongue?

95
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.330
Gentlemen, content ye.

96
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.070
I am resolved.

97
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.530
Go in, Bianca.

98
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.300
And for I know she taketh most delight

99
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.800
in music, instruments, and poetry,

100
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.100
schoolmasters will I have within my house,

101
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.070
fit to instruct her youth.

102
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.270
If you, Hortensio, or, Signior Gremio, you,

103
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.670
know any such, prefer them hither,

104
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.000
for to cunning men I will be very kind

105
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.170
and liberal to mine own children in good bringing up.

106
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.200
And so farewell.

107
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.370
Katharina, you may stay,

108
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.970
for I have more to commune with Bianca.

109
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.930
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?

110
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.530
What?

111
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.700
Shall I be appointed hours?

112
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.000
As though, belike,

113
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.530
I knew not what to take and what to leave?

114
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.530
Ooh.

115
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.470
Ha!

116
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.370
Oh.

117
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.470
Phew.

118
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.730
You may go to the devil's dam.

119
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.700
Your gifts are so good, here's none will hold you.

120
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.070
Their love is not so great, Hortensio,

121
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.670
but we may blow our nails together

122
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.870
and fast it fairly out.

123
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.270
Our cakes dough on both sides.

124
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.800
Farewell.

125
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.930
And yet for the love I bear my sweet Bianca,

126
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.100
if I can by any means light on a fit man

127
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.970
to teach her that wherein she delights,

128
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.330
I will wish him to her father.

129
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.570
So will I, Signior Gremio,

130
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.000
but a word, I pray.

131
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.870
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle,

132
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.500
know now, upon advice,

133
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.800
it touches us both

134
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.570
that we may yet again have access

135
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.530
to our fair mistress and be happy rivals

136
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.700
in Bianco's love,

137
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.430
to labor and effect one thing specially.

138
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.630
What's that, I pray?

139
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.030
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.

140
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.130
A husband? A devil.

141
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.230
I say a husband.

142
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.500
I say a devil.

143
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.570
Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though her father be very rich,

144
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.770
any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?

145
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.030
Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine

146
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.470
to endure her loud alarums,

147
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.530
why, man, there be good fellows in the world,

148
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.900
an a man should light on them,

149
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.200
would take her with all faults, and money enough.

150
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.400
I cannot tell,

151
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.730
but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition

152
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.870
to be whipped at the high cross every morning.

153
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.800
Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten apples,

154
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.030
but come;

155
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.700
since this bar in law makes us friends,

156
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.530
it shall be so far forth friendly maintained

157
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.530
till by helping Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband

158
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.500
we set his youngest free for a husband

159
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.530
and then have to't a fresh, hmm?

160
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.700
Sweet Bianca.

161
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.400
Happy man be his dole.

162
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.100
He that runs fastest gets the ring.

163
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.470
How say you, Signior Gremio?

164
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.870
I am agreed,

165
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.500
and would I had given him the best horse in Padua

166
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.800
to begin his wooing

167
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.370
that would thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her,

168
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.970
and rid the house of her.

169
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:01.970
Come on.

170
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.900
I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible

171
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.270
that love should of a sudden take such hold?

172
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.870
Tranio, till I found it to be true,

173
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.630
I never thought it possible or likely;

174
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.470
But see, while idly I stood looking on,

175
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.270
I found the effect of love in idleness

176
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.130
and now in plainness do confess to thee,

177
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.730
that art to me as secret and as dear

178
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.470
as Anna to the queen of Carthage was,

179
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.630
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,

180
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.600
if I achieve not this young, modest girl.

181
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.930
Well, counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst.

182
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.800
Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.

183
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.900
Master, it is no time to chide you now.

184
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.500
Affection is not rated from the heart.

185
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.700
If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so--

186
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.970
"Redime te captum quam queas minimo."

187
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.100
Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:

188
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.300
the rest will comfort for thy counsel's sound.

189
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.230
Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,

190
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.370
perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.

191
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.070
O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face

192
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.670
such as the daughter of Agenor had

193
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.730
that made great Jove to humble him to her hand

194
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.970
when with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.

195
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.070
Saw you no more?

196
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.430
Mark'd you not how her sister

197
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.330
began to scold and raise up such a storm

198
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.470
that mortal ears might hardly endure the din?

199
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.970
Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,

200
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.230
and with her breath, she did perfume the air.

201
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.330
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.

202
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.570
Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.

203
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.430
I pray, awake, sir.

204
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.730
If you love the maid,

205
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.270
bend thoughts and wits to achieve her.

206
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.770
Thus it stands.

207
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.700
Her eldest sister is so cursed and shrewd

208
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.670
that till the father rid his hands of her,

209
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.900
Master, your love must live a maid at home.

210
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.870
Therefore has he closely mew'd her up,

211
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.030
because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.

212
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.930
Oh, Tranio, what a cruel father's he.

213
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:37.130
But art thou not advised,

214
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.470
he took some care to get her cunning schoolmasters

215
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.000
to instruct her?

216
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.970
Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now 'tis plotted.

217
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.300
I have it, Tranio.

218
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.970
Master, for my hand, both our inventions meet and jump in one.

219
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.300
Well, tell me thine first.

220
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.170
You will be schoolmaster and undertake the teaching of the maid.

221
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.200
- That's your device. - It is; may it be done?

222
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.230
Not possible, for who shall bear your part,

223
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.000
and be in Padua here Vincentio's son,

224
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.300
keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,

225
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.270
visit his countrymen and banquet them?

226
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.470
Basta; content thee, for I have it full.

227
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.270
We have not yet been seen in any house,

228
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.830
nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces for man or master.

229
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.030
Then it follows thus,

230
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.300
thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,

231
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.370
keep house and port and servants as I should.

232
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.200
I will some other be, some Florentine,

233
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.130
some Neapolitan, or a meaner man of Pisa.

234
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.600
'Tis hatch'd and shall be so.

235
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.270
Tranio, at once, uncase thee.

236
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.870
Take my color'd hat and cloak.

237
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.100
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee,

238
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.270
but I will charm him first to keep his tongue.

239
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.800
So had you need.

240
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.730
In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,

241
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.270
and I am tied to be obedient,

242
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.100
for so your father charged me at our parting.

243
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.800
"Be serviceable to my son," quoth he,

244
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.800
although I think 'twas in another sense.

245
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.830
I am content to be Lucentio, because so well I love Lucentio.

246
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.770
Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves,

247
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.630
and let me be a slave to achieve that maid

248
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.030
whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.

249
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.330
Here comes the rogue.

250
00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.730
Sirrah, where have you been?

251
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.930
Where have I been?

252
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.300
Nay, how now. Where are you?

253
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.870
Dear Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes?

254
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.070
Or you stolen his?

255
00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.570
Or both? Pray, what's the news?

256
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.900
Sirrah, come hither.

257
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.730
'Tis no time to jest, and feign your manners to the time.

258
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.670
Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,

259
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.500
puts my apparel and my countenance on,

260
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.230
for in a quarrel since I came ashore,

261
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.000
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried.

262
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.930
Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,

263
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.900
while I make way from hence to save my life.

264
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.000
You understand me?

265
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.100
I, sir? Ne'er a whit.

266
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.770
And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth.

267
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.330
Tranio is changed into Lucentio.

268
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.530
Yeah, the better for him.

269
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.870
Would I were so too.

270
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.370
So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,

271
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.030
that Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.

272
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.230
But, sirrah, not for my sake but your master's,

273
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.270
I advise you use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.

274
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.070
When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;

275
00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.200
but in all places else, your master Lucentio.

276
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.000
Tranio, let's go.

277
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.070
One thing more rests that thyself execute--

278
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.570
to make one among these wooers--

279
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:53.970
if thou ask me why, sufficeth,

280
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.130
my reasons are both good and weighty.

281
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.370
Verona, for a while, I take my leave,

282
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.400
to see my friends in Padua,

283
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.000
but of all--

284
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.230
oh--

285
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:22.370
my best beloved and approved friend, Hortensio;

286
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.770
and I trow this is his house.

287
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.830
Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.

288
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:26.930
Knock, sir?

289
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:28.100
Whom should I knock?

290
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.500
Is there any man has abused your worship?

291
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.630
Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.

292
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.900
Knock you here, sir?

293
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.330
Why, what am I, sir, that I should knock you here, sir?

294
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.070
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate

295
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.300
and rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.

296
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.800
My master is grown quarrelsome.

297
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.000
I should knock you first,

298
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.870
then I know after who comes by the worst.

299
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.030
Will it not be?

300
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.130
Faith, sirrah,

301
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.730
an you'll not knock, I'll ring it.

302
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.600
I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.

303
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.430
Help, masters, help! My master is mad!

304
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.400
Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!

305
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.730
How now, what's the matter?

306
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:59.200
My old friend Grumio...

307
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.930
And my good friend Petruchio!

308
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.700
How do you all at Verona?

309
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.130
Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?

310
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.700
"Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato," may I say.

311
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:18.730
Ooh, um, "Alla nostra casa ben venuto,

312
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.470
molto honorato signor mio Petruchio."

313
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:23.570
Rise, Grumio, rise.

314
00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.700
Up, up, up, up.

315
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.170
We will compound this quarrel.

316
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.470
Nay, sir, 'tis no matter, what he 'leges in Latin.

317
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.070
If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service,

318
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.730
look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir.

319
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.030
Well, was it fit for a servant to use his master so,

320
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.330
being perhaps, for aught I see, 2 and 30, a pip out,

321
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.170
whom to God I had well knock'd at first,

322
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.930
then had not Grumio come by the worst?

323
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.130
A senseless villain.

324
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.530
Good Hortensio, I bade the rascal knock upon your gate

325
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.470
and could not get him for my heart to do it.

326
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.270
Knock at the gate? O heavens, spake you not these words plain,

327
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.600
"Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here, knock me well,

328
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.700
knock me soundly"?

329
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.670
And come you now with, "Knock at the gate"?

330
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.630
Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.

331
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.870
Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge.

332
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.470
Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,

333
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.270
your ancient, pleasant, trusty servant Grumio.

334
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.730
And tell me now, sweet friend,

335
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.770
what happy gale blows you to Padua here from old Verona?

336
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.900
Oh, such wind as scatters young men through the world

337
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.970
to seek their fortune farther than at home

338
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.430
where small experience grows.

339
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.370
But in a few, Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me.

340
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.930
Antonio, my father, is deceased,

341
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.130
Oh.

342
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.330
Oh.

343
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.430
And I have thrust myself into this maze,

344
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.500
haply to wive and thrive as best I may.

345
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.930
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,

346
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.330
and so am come abroad to see the world.

347
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.000
Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee

348
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.300
and wish thee to a shrewd ill-favor'd wife?

349
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.500
Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel,

350
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.000
and yet I promise you, she shall be rich, and very rich.

351
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.470
Yet thou'rt too much my friend,

352
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.830
and I'll not wish thee to her.

353
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.030
Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we,

354
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.200
few words suffice;

355
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.230
and therefore, if thou know one rich enough

356
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:58.500
to be Petruchio's wife,

357
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.400
as wealth is burden of my wooing dance,

358
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.300
be she as foul as was Florentius' love,

359
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.430
as old as Sibyl,

360
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.000
and as cursed and shrewd as Socrates' Xanthippe--

361
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.070
or a worse-- she moves me not,

362
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.000
or not removes, at least, affection's edge in me,

363
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.470
were she as rough as are the Adriatic seas:

364
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.400
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua.

365
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.170
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.

366
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.730
Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is.

367
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.970
Why, give him gold enough, marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby

368
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.170
or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head,

369
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.730
though she have as many diseases as 2 and 50 horses,

370
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.700
nothing comes amiss so money comes withal.

371
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.530
But, Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,

372
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.570
I will continue that I broach'd in jest.

373
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.270
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife

374
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.930
with wealth enough and young and beauteous,

375
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.930
brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman.

376
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.530
Her only fault, and that is faults enough,

377
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.770
is that she is intolerable cursed and shrewd and froward,

378
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.330
so beyond all measure that,

379
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.300
were my state far worser than it is,

380
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.300
I would not wed her for a mine of gold.

381
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.570
Hortensio, peace.

382
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.070
Thou know'st not gold's effect.

383
00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.100
Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough,

384
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.470
for I will board her,

385
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:08.470
though she chide as loud as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.

386
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.170
Her father is Baptista Minola, an affable and courteous gentleman.

387
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.330
Her name is Katharina Minola,

388
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.870
renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.

389
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.370
I know her father, though I know not her.

390
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.670
He knew my deceased father well.

391
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.730
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;

392
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.700
and therefore, let me be thus bold with you

393
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.630
to give you over at this first encounter,

394
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.470
unless you will accompany me thither.

395
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.770
I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.

396
00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.630
O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do,

397
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.200
she would think scolding would do little good upon him.

398
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.500
She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so.

399
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.430
That's nothing, an he begin once, he'll rail in his rope tricks.

400
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.870
I'll tell you what sir, an she stand him but a little,

401
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.530
he'll throw a figure in her face, so disfigure her with it,

402
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.870
she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.

403
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.130
You know him not, sir.

404
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:51.970
Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,

405
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.800
for in Baptista's keep, my treasure is.

406
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.230
He hath the jewel of my life in hold--

407
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.500
his youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca--

408
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.970
and her withholds from me and other more,

409
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.930
suitors to her and rivals in my love,

410
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.430
supposing it a thing impossible

411
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.130
for those defects I have before rehearsed

412
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.430
that ever Katharina shall be woo'd.

413
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.170
Therefore, this order hath Baptista ta'en

414
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.830
that none shall have access unto Bianca

415
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.100
till Katharine the cursed have got a husband.

416
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.170
Katharine the cursed, a title for a maid, of all titles the worst.

417
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:24.300
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace

418
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.700
and offer me disguised in sober robes

419
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.900
to old Baptista as a schoolmaster

420
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.030
well seen in music to instruct Bianca

421
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.400
that so I may by this device

422
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.700
at least have leave and leisure to make love to her

423
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.630
and, unsuspected, court her by herself.

424
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.830
Here's no knavery.

425
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.230
See, to beguile the old folks,

426
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.370
how the young folks lay their heads together.

427
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.770
Master, master, look about you. Who goes there, ha?

428
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.030
Oh, oh, peace, Grumio.

429
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.230
It is the rival of my love.

430
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.670
Petruchio, stand by a while.

431
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.230
O, very well.

432
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.100
I have perused the note.

433
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.400
Hark you, sir,

434
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.530
I'll have them very fairly bound:

435
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.100
all books of love, see that at any hand;

436
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.400
and see you read no other lectures to her,

437
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.330
you understand me.

438
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.370
Over and beside Signior Baptista's liberality,

439
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.430
I'll mend it with a largess.

440
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.830
Take your paper too,

441
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:14.770
and let me have them very well perfumed,

442
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.770
for she is sweeter than perfume itself

443
00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:17.870
to whom they go to.

444
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:18.970
Mm.

445
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.470
Nay, what will you read to her?

446
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.400
Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you

447
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.230
as for my patron, stand you so assured,

448
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.230
as firmly as yourself were still in place.

449
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.800
Yea, and perhaps with more successful words than you--

450
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.900
Hmm?

451
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.370
Unless you were a scholar, sir.

452
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.700
O this learning, what a thing it is.

453
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.300
O this woodcock, what an ass it is.

454
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.470
Grumio, mum.

455
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:37.900
God save you, Signior Gremio.

456
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.170
And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.

457
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.500
Trow you whither I am going?

458
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.830
To Baptista Minola.

459
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.530
I promised to inquire carefully

460
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.500
about a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca,

461
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.770
and by good fortune,

462
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.730
I have lighted well on this young man,

463
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.400
for learning and behavior fit for her turn,

464
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.370
well read in poetry and other books, good ones, I warrant ye.

465
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.630
'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman

466
00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.670
hath promised me to show me to another,

467
00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.100
a fine musician to instruct our mistress;

468
00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.970
so shall I no whit be behind in duty to fair Bianca,

469
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.170
so beloved of me.

470
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.270
Beloved of me, and that my deeds shall prove.

471
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.670
And that his bags shall prove.

472
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:14.300
Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love.

473
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.730
Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,

474
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.200
I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.

475
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.770
Here is a gentleman by chance I met,

476
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.030
upon agreement from us to his liking,

477
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:26.970
will undertake to woo cursed Katharine.

478
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.070
Huh?

479
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.300
Yea, and to marry her

480
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.270
if her dowry please.

481
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.930
So said, so done, is well.

482
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.530
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?

483
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.600
I know she is an irksome, brawling scold.

484
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.430
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.

485
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.300
No, say'st me so, friend?

486
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.500
What countryman?

487
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.670
Born in Verona, old Antonio's son.

488
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:47.770
My father dead--

489
00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:48.870
Oh.

490
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.070
my fortune lives for me,

491
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.170
and I do hope good days and long to see.

492
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.030
O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange,

493
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.270
but if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name.

494
00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.970
You shall have me assisting you in all.

495
00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.100
But will you woo this wildcat?

496
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.200
Will I live?

497
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.330
Will he woo her? Aye, or I'll hang her.

498
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.070
Why came I hither but to that intent?

499
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.870
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?

500
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.300
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?

501
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.630
Have I not heard the sea, puff'd up with winds,

502
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.770
rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?

503
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.930
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,

504
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.570
and heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?

505
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.770
Have I not, in a pitched battle, heard

506
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.930
loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?

507
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.530
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue

508
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.100
that gives not half so great a blow to hear

509
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.900
as will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?

510
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.930
Tush, tush. Fear boys with bugs.

511
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.800
For he fears none.

512
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.270
Hortensio, hark,

513
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.170
this gentleman is happily arrived,

514
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.200
my mind presumes, for his own good and ours.

515
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.230
Mm, I promised we would be contributors

516
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.330
and bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe'er.

517
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.500
And so we will, provided that he win her.

518
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.800
I would I were as sure of a good dinner.

519
00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.430
Gentlemen, God save you.

520
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.500
If I may be bold, tell me, I beseech you,

521
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.770
which is the readiest way

522
00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.770
to the house of Signior Baptista Minola?

523
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.430
He that has the two fair daughters?

524
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:07.530
Is't he you mean?

525
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.630
Even he, Biondello.

526
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.630
Hark you, sir, you mean not her to--

527
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:11.870
Perhaps, him and her, sir.

528
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.100
What have you to do?

529
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.770
Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.

530
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.330
I love no chiders, sir.

531
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:18.670
Biondello, let's away.

532
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:19.800
Well begun, Tranio.

533
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.470
Sir, a word ere you go.

534
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.330
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of,

535
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:24.430
yea or no?

536
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.500
And if I be, sir, is it any offence?

537
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.530
No, if without more words you will get you hence.

538
00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.600
Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free

539
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.330
for me as for you?

540
00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:34.670
But so is not she.

541
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.270
For what reason, I beseech you?

542
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.830
For this reason, if you'll know,

543
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.970
that she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.

544
00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.070
That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.

545
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.700
Softly, my masters.

546
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.230
If you be gentlemen, do me this right.

547
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.870
Hear me with patience.

548
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.830
Baptista is a noble gentleman

549
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.400
to whom my father is not all unknown,

550
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.700
and were his daughter fairer than she is,

551
00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.230
she may more suitors have and me for one.

552
00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.730
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers.

553
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.870
Then well one more may fair Bianca have,

554
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.070
and so she shall.

555
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.500
Lucentio shall make one,

556
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.130
though Paris came in hope to speed alone.

557
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:10.170
What, this gentleman will out-talk us all.

558
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.300
Sir, give him head.

559
00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.630
I know he'll prove a jade.

560
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.730
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?

561
00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.370
Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,

562
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.300
did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?

563
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.430
No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two,

564
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.470
the one as famous for a scolding tongue

565
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.330
as is the other for beauteous modesty.

566
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.700
Sir, sir, the first's for me.

567
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.830
Let her go by.

568
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.430
Yea, leave that labor to great Hercules,

569
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.570
and let it be more than Alcides' 12.

570
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.970
Sir, understand you this of me in sooth.

571
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.800
The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,

572
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.030
her father keeps from all access of suitors

573
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.500
and will not promise her to any man

574
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.700
until the elder sister first be wed.

575
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.100
The younger then is free and not before.

576
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.470
If it be so, sir,

577
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.370
that you are the man must stead us all--

578
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:57.700
and me amongst the rest--

579
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.100
and if you break the ice and do this feat,

580
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.200
achieve the elder,

581
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.530
and set the younger free for our access,

582
00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.200
whose hap shall be to have her

583
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.830
will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

584
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.830
Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive,

585
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.030
and since you do profess to be a suitor,

586
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.200
you must, as we do, gratify this gentleman

587
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.600
to whom we all--all rest generally beholding.

588
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.770
Sir, I shall not be slack.

589
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:20.900
In sign whereof,

590
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.870
please you we may contrive this afternoon

591
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.200
and quaff carouses to our mistress' health

592
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.330
and do as adversaries do in law--

593
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.700
strive mightily but eat and drink as friends.

594
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.570
Excellent motion.

595
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:34.700
Let's be gone.

596
00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.430
The motion's good indeed, and be it so.

597
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.970
Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.

598
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.970
