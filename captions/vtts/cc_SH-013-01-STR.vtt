00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.700
Tranio,

3
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.170
since for the great desireI had

4
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.830
to see fair Padua, nurseryof arts,

5
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.170
I am arrived for fruitfulLombardy, the pleasantgarden of great Italy;

6
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.100
and by my father's loveand leave am arm'd

7
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.970
with his good will and thygood company,

8
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.930
my trusty servant,well-approved in all,

9
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.800
here let us breathe andhaply institute

10
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.870
a course of learning andingenious studies.

11
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.430
Pisa renown'd for gravecitizens

12
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.170
gave me my being and myfather first,

13
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.370
a merchant of greattraffic through the world,

14
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.970
Vincetino come ofBentivolii.

15
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.900
Vincetino's son brought upin Florence,

16
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.030
it shall become to serveall hopes conceived,

17
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.100
to deck his fortune withhis virtuous deeds.

18
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.170
And therefore, Tranio, forthe time I study,

19
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.830
virtue and that part ofphilosophy

20
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.200
will I apply that treatsof happiness by virtuespecially to be achieved.

21
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.400
Well, tell me thy mind,

22
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.230
for I have Pisa left andam to Padua come

23
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.830
as he that leaves ashallow plash to plungehim in the deep

24
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.900
and with satiety seeks toquench his thirst.

25
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.600
Mi perdonato, gentlemaster mine,

26
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.870
I am in all affected asyourself,

27
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.870
glad that you thus resolve

28
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.000
to suck the sweets ofsweet philosophy.

29
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.200
Only, good master, whilewe do admire

30
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.500
this virtue and this moraldiscipline,

31
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.800
let's be no stoics nor nostocks, I pray,

32
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.830
or so devote toAristotle's cheques

33
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.600
as Ovid be an outcastquite abjured.

34
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.030
Balk logic withacquaintance that you have

35
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.300
and practise rhetoric inyour common talk.

36
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.470
Music and poesy use toquicken you.

37
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.070
The mathematics andmetaphysics,

38
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.670
fall to them as you findyour stomach serves you.

39
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.630
No profit grows where isno pleasure ta'en.

40
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.830
In brief, sir, study whatyou most affect.

41
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.600
Gramercies, Tranio, welldost thou advise.

42
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.930
If, Biondello, thou wertcome ashore,

43
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.700
we could at once put us inreadiness--

44
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.800
ow--

45
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.500
and take a lodging fit toentertain

46
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.670
such friends as time inPadua shall beget.

47
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.770
But stay a while.

48
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.900
What company is this?

49
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.330
Master, some show towelcome us to town.

50
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.630
Gentlemen, importune me nofarther,

51
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.970
for how I firmly amresolved you know;

52
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.830
that is, not bestow myyoungest daughter

53
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.730
before I have a husbandfor the elder.

54
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.530
If either of you both loveKatharina,

55
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.470
because I know you welland love you well,

56
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.800
leave shall you have tocourt her at your pleasure.

57
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.900
To cart her rather.

58
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.370
She's too rough for me.

59
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.570
There, there, Hortensio,will you any wife?

60
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.770
I pray you, sir, is ityour will

61
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.500
to make a stale of meamongst these mates?

62
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.630
Mates, maid, how mean youthat?

63
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.800
No mates for you

64
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.170
unless you were ofgentler, milder mold.

65
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.470
I' faith, sir, you shallnever need to fear.

66
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.000
I wis it is not halfway toher heart,

67
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.900
but if it were, doubt nother care should be

68
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.730
to comb your noddle with athree-legg'd stool

69
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.730
and paint your face anduse you like a fool.

70
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.400
From all such devils, goodLord deliver us.

71
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.930
And me too, good Lord.

72
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.630
Hush, master.

73
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.230
Here's some good pastimetoward.

74
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.700
That wench is stark mad orwonderful froward.

75
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.970
But in the other's silence

76
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.070
do I see maid's mildbehavior and sobriety.

77
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.430
Peace, Tranio.

78
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.200
Gentlemen, that I may soonmake good what I have said--

79
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.870
Bianca, get you in,

80
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.630
and let it not displeasethee, good Bianca,

81
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.670
for I will love thee ne'erthe less, my girl.

82
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.300
A pretty peat.

83
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.130
It is best put finger inthe eye,

84
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.230
an she knew why.

85
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.070
Sister, content you in mydiscontent.

86
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.230
Sir, to your pleasurehumbly I subscribe.

87
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.870
My books and instrumentsshall be my company,

88
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.570
on them to look andpractise by myself.

89
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.300
Hark, Tranio, thou may'sthear Minerva speak.

90
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.570
Signior Baptista, will yoube so strange?

91
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.570
Sorry am I that our goodwill effects Bianca's grief.

92
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.770
Why will you mew her up,Signior Baptista,

93
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.000
for this fiend of hell,

94
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.500
and make her bear thepenance of her tongue?

95
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.330
Gentlemen, content ye.

96
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.070
I am resolved.

97
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.530
Go in, Bianca.

98
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.300
And for I know she takethmost delight

99
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.800
in music, instruments, andpoetry,

100
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.100
schoolmasters will I havewithin my house,

101
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.070
fit to instruct her youth.

102
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.270
If you, Hortensio, or,Signior Gremio, you,

103
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.670
know any such, prefer themhither,

104
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.000
for to cunning men I willbe very kind

105
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.170
and liberal to mine ownchildren in good bringing up.

106
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.200
And so farewell.

107
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.370
Katharina, you may stay,

108
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.970
for I have more to communewith Bianca.

109
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.930
Why, and I trust I may gotoo, may I not?

110
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.530
What?

111
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.700
Shall I be appointedhours?

112
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.000
As though, belike,

113
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.530
I knew not what to takeand what to leave?

114
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.530
Ooh.

115
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.470
Ha!

116
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.370
Oh.

117
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.470
Phew.

118
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.730
You may go to the devil'sdam.

119
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.700
Your gifts are so good,here's none will hold you.

120
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.070
Their love is not sogreat, Hortensio,

121
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.670
but we may blow our nailstogether

122
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.870
and fast it fairly out.

123
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.270
Our cakes dough on bothsides.

124
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.800
Farewell.

125
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.930
And yet for the love Ibear my sweet Bianca,

126
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.100
if I can by any meanslight on a fit man

127
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.970
to teach her that whereinshe delights,

128
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.330
I will wish him to herfather.

129
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.570
So will I, Signior Gremio,

130
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.000
but a word, I pray.

131
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.870
Though the nature of ourquarrel yet never brookedparle,

132
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.500
know now, upon advice,

133
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.800
it touches us both

134
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.570
that we may yet again haveaccess

135
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.530
to our fair mistress andbe happy rivals

136
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.700
in Bianco's love,

137
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.430
to labor and effect onething specially.

138
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.630
What's that, I pray?

139
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.030
Marry, sir, to get ahusband for her sister.

140
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.130
A husband? A devil.

141
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.230
I say a husband.

142
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.500
I say a devil.

143
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.570
Thinkest thou, Hortensio,though her father be very rich,

144
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.770
any man is so very a foolto be married to hell?

145
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.030
Tush, Gremio, though itpass your patience and mine

146
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.470
to endure her loudalarums,

147
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.530
why, man, there be goodfellows in the world,

148
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.900
an a man should light onthem,

149
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.200
would take her with allfaults, and money enough.

150
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.400
I cannot tell,

151
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.730
but I had as lief take herdowry with this condition

152
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.870
to be whipped at the highcross every morning.

153
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.800
Faith, as you say, there'ssmall choice in rotten apples,

154
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.030
but come;

155
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.700
since this bar in lawmakes us friends,

156
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.530
it shall be so far forthfriendly maintained

157
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.530
till by helping Baptista'seldest daughter to a husband

158
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.500
we set his youngest freefor a husband

159
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.530
and then have to't afresh, hmm?

160
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.700
Sweet Bianca.

161
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.400
Happy man be his dole.

162
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.100
He that runs fastest getsthe ring.

163
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.470
How say you, SigniorGremio?

164
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.870
I am agreed,

165
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.500
and would I had given himthe best horse in Padua

166
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.800
to begin his wooing

167
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.370
that would thoroughly wooher, wed her and bed her,

168
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.970
and rid the house of her.

169
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:01.970
Come on.

170
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.900
I pray, sir, tell me, isit possible

171
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.270
that love should of asudden take such hold?

172
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.870
Tranio, till I found it tobe true,

173
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.630
I never thought itpossible or likely;

174
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.470
But see, while idly Istood looking on,

175
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.270
I found the effect of lovein idleness

176
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.130
and now in plainness doconfess to thee,

177
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.730
that art to me as secretand as dear

178
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.470
as Anna to the queen ofCarthage was,

179
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.630
Tranio, I burn, I pine, Iperish, Tranio,

180
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.600
if I achieve not thisyoung, modest girl.

181
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.930
Well, counsel me, Tranio,for I know thou canst.

182
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.800
Assist me, Tranio, for Iknow thou wilt.

183
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.900
Master, it is no time tochide you now.

184
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.500
Affection is not ratedfrom the heart.

185
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.700
If love have touch'd you,nought remains but so--

186
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.970
"Redime te captum quamqueas minimo."

187
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.100
Gramercies, lad, goforward; this contents:

188
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.300
the rest will comfort forthy counsel's sound.

189
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.230
Master, you look'd solongly on the maid,

190
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.370
perhaps you mark'd notwhat's the pith of all.

191
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.070
O yes, I saw sweet beautyin her face

192
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.670
such as the daughter ofAgenor had

193
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.730
that made great Jove tohumble him to her hand

194
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.970
when with his knees hekiss'd the Cretan strand.

195
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.070
Saw you no more?

196
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.430
Mark'd you not how hersister

197
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.330
began to scold and raiseup such a storm

198
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.470
that mortal ears mighthardly endure the din?

199
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.970
Tranio, I saw her corallips to move,

200
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.230
and with her breath, shedid perfume the air.

201
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.330
Sacred and sweet was all Isaw in her.

202
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.570
Nay, then, 'tis time tostir him from his trance.

203
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.430
I pray, awake, sir.

204
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.730
If you love the maid,

205
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.270
bend thoughts and wits toachieve her.

206
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.770
Thus it stands.

207
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.700
Her eldest sister is socursed and shrewd

208
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.670
that till the father ridhis hands of her,

209
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.900
Master, your love mustlive a maid at home.

210
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.870
Therefore has he closelymew'd her up,

211
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.030
because she will not beannoy'd with suitors.

212
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.930
Oh, Tranio, what a cruelfather's he.

213
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:37.130
But art thou not advised,

214
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.470
he took some care to gether cunning schoolmasters

215
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.000
to instruct her?

216
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.970
Ay, marry, am I, sir, andnow 'tis plotted.

217
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.300
I have it, Tranio.

218
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.970
Master, for my hand, bothour inventions meet andjump in one.

219
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.300
Well, tell me thine first.

220
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.170
You will be schoolmasterand undertake the teachingof the maid.

221
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.200
- That's your device. - Itis; may it be done?

222
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.230
Not possible, for whoshall bear your part,

223
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.000
and be in Padua hereVincentio's son,

224
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.300
keep house and ply hisbook, welcome his friends,

225
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.270
visit his countrymen andbanquet them?

226
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.470
Basta; content thee, for Ihave it full.

227
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.270
We have not yet been seenin any house,

228
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.830
nor can we liedistinguish'd by our facesfor man or master.

229
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.030
Then it follows thus,

230
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.300
thou shalt be master,Tranio, in my stead,

231
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.370
keep house and port andservants as I should.

232
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.200
I will some other be, someFlorentine,

233
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.130
some Neapolitan, or ameaner man of Pisa.

234
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.600
'Tis hatch'd and shall beso.

235
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.270
Tranio, at once, uncasethee.

236
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.870
Take my color'd hat andcloak.

237
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.100
When Biondello comes, hewaits on thee,

238
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.270
but I will charm him firstto keep his tongue.

239
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.800
So had you need.

240
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.730
In brief, sir, sith ityour pleasure is,

241
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.270
and I am tied to beobedient,

242
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.100
for so your father chargedme at our parting.

243
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.800
"Be serviceable to myson," quoth he,

244
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.800
although I think 'twas inanother sense.

245
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.830
I am content to beLucentio, because so wellI love Lucentio.

246
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.770
Tranio, be so, becauseLucentio loves,

247
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.630
and let me be a slave toachieve that maid

248
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.030
whose sudden sight haththrall'd my wounded eye.

249
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.330
Here comes the rogue.

250
00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.730
Sirrah, where have youbeen?

251
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.930
Where have I been?

252
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.300
Nay, how now. Where areyou?

253
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.870
Dear Master, has my fellowTranio stolen your clothes?

254
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.070
Or you stolen his?

255
00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.570
Or both? Pray, what's thenews?

256
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.900
Sirrah, come hither.

257
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.730
'Tis no time to jest, and feignyour manners to the time.

258
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.670
Your fellow Tranio here,to save my life,

259
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.500
puts my apparel and mycountenance on,

260
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.230
for in a quarrel since Icame ashore,

261
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.000
I kill'd a man and fear Iwas descried.

262
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.930
Wait you on him, I chargeyou, as becomes,

263
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.900
while I make way fromhence to save my life.

264
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.000
You understand me?

265
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.100
I, sir? Ne'er a whit.

266
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.770
And not a jot of Tranio inyour mouth.

267
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.330
Tranio is changed intoLucentio.

268
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.530
Yeah, the better for him.

269
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.870
Would I were so too.

270
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.370
So could I, faith, boy, tohave the next wish after,

271
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.030
that Lucentio indeed hadBaptista's youngest daughter.

272
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.230
But, sirrah, not for mysake but your master's,

273
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.270
I advise you use yourmanners discreetly in allkind of companies.

274
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.070
When I am alone, why, thenI am Tranio;

275
00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.200
but in all places else,your master Lucentio.

276
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.000
Tranio, let's go.

277
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.070
One thing more rests thatthyself execute--

278
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.570
to make one among thesewooers--

279
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:53.970
if thou ask me why,sufficeth,

280
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.130
my reasons are both goodand weighty.

281
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.370
Verona, for a while, Itake my leave,

282
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.400
to see my friends inPadua,

283
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.000
but of all--

284
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.230
oh--

285
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:22.370
my best beloved andapproved friend, Hortensio;

286
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.770
and I trow this is hishouse.

287
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.830
Here, sirrah Grumio,knock, I say.

288
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:26.930
Knock, sir?

289
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:28.100
Whom should I knock?

290
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.500
Is there any man hasabused your worship?

291
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.630
Villain, I say, knock mehere soundly.

292
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.900
Knock you here, sir?

293
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.330
Why, what am I, sir, that Ishould knock you here, sir?

294
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.070
Villain, I say, knock meat this gate

295
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.300
and rap me well, or I'llknock your knave's pate.

296
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.800
My master is grownquarrelsome.

297
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.000
I should knock you first,

298
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.870
then I know after whocomes by the worst.

299
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.030
Will it not be?

300
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.130
Faith, sirrah,

301
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.730
an you'll not knock, I'llring it.

302
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.600
I'll try how you can sol,fa, and sing it.

303
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.430
Help, masters, help! Mymaster is mad!

304
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.400
Now, knock when I bid you,sirrah villain!

305
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.730
How now, what's thematter?

306
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:59.200
My old friend Grumio...

307
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.930
And my good friendPetruchio!

308
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.700
How do you all at Verona?

309
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.130
Signior Hortensio, comeyou to part the fray?

310
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.700
"Con tutto il cuore, bentrovato," may I say.

311
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:18.730
Ooh, um, "Alla nostra casaben venuto,

312
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.470
molto honorato signor mioPetruchio."

313
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:23.570
Rise, Grumio, rise.

314
00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.700
Up, up, up, up.

315
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.170
We will compound thisquarrel.

316
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.470
Nay, sir, 'tis no matter,what he 'leges in Latin.

317
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.070
If this be not a lawful causefor me to leave his service,

318
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.730
look you, sir, he bid meknock him and rap himsoundly, sir.

319
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.030
Well, was it fit for aservant to use his master so,

320
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.330
being perhaps, for aught Isee, 2 and 30, a pip out,

321
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.170
whom to God I had wellknock'd at first,

322
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.930
then had not Grumio comeby the worst?

323
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.130
A senseless villain.

324
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.530
Good Hortensio, I bade therascal knock upon yourgate

325
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.470
and could not get him formy heart to do it.

326
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.270
Knock at the gate? Oheavens, spake you notthese words plain,

327
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.600
"Sirrah, knock me here, rapme here, knock me well,

328
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.700
knock me soundly"?

329
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.670
And come you now with,"Knock at the gate"?

330
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.630
Sirrah, be gone, or talknot, I advise you.

331
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.870
Petruchio, patience; I amGrumio's pledge.

332
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.470
Why, this's a heavy chance'twixt him and you,

333
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.270
your ancient, pleasant,trusty servant Grumio.

334
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.730
And tell me now, sweetfriend,

335
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.770
what happy gale blows you toPadua here from old Verona?

336
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.900
Oh, such wind as scattersyoung men through the world

337
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.970
to seek their fortunefarther than at home

338
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.430
where small experiencegrows.

339
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.370
But in a few, SigniorHortensio, thus it standswith me.

340
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.930
Antonio, my father, isdeceased,

341
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.130
Oh.

342
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.330
Oh.

343
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.430
And I have thrust myselfinto this maze,

344
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.500
haply to wive and thriveas best I may.

345
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.930
Crowns in my purse I haveand goods at home,

346
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.330
and so am come abroad tosee the world.

347
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.000
Petruchio, shall I thencome roundly to thee

348
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.300
and wish thee to a shrewdill-favor'd wife?

349
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.500
Thou'ldst thank me but alittle for my counsel,

350
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.000
and yet I promise you, sheshall be rich, and very rich.

351
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.470
Yet thou'rt too much myfriend,

352
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.830
and I'll not wish thee toher.

353
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.030
Signior Hortensio, 'twixtsuch friends as we,

354
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.200
few words suffice;

355
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.230
and therefore, if thouknow one rich enough

356
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:58.500
to be Petruchio's wife,

357
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.400
as wealth is burden of mywooing dance,

358
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.300
be she as foul as wasFlorentius' love,

359
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.430
as old as Sibyl,

360
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.000
and as cursed and shrewdas Socrates' Xanthippe--

361
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.070
or a worse-- she moves menot,

362
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.000
or not removes, at least,affection's edge in me,

363
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.470
were she as rough as arethe Adriatic seas:

364
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.400
I come to wive itwealthily in Padua.

365
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.170
If wealthily, then happilyin Padua.

366
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.730
Nay, look you, sir, hetells you flatly what hismind is.

367
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.970
Why, give him gold enough,marry him to a puppet oran aglet-baby

368
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.170
or an old trot with ne'era tooth in her head,

369
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.730
though she have as manydiseases as 2 and 50 horses,

370
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.700
nothing comes amiss somoney comes withal.

371
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.530
But, Petruchio, since weare stepp'd thus far in,

372
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.570
I will continue that Ibroach'd in jest.

373
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.270
I can, Petruchio, helpthee to a wife

374
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.930
with wealth enough andyoung and beauteous,

375
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.930
brought up as best becomesa gentlewoman.

376
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.530
Her only fault, and thatis faults enough,

377
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.770
is that she is intolerablecursed and shrewd andfroward,

378
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.330
so beyond all measurethat,

379
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.300
were my state far worserthan it is,

380
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.300
I would not wed her for amine of gold.

381
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.570
Hortensio, peace.

382
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.070
Thou know'st not gold'seffect.

383
00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.100
Tell me her father's name,and 'tis enough,

384
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.470
for I will board her,

385
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:08.470
though she chide as loudas thunder when the cloudsin autumn crack.

386
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.170
Her father is BaptistaMinola, an affable andcourteous gentleman.

387
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.330
Her name is KatharinaMinola,

388
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.870
renown'd in Padua for herscolding tongue.

389
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.370
I know her father, thoughI know not her.

390
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.670
He knew my deceased fatherwell.

391
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.730
I will not sleep,Hortensio, till I see her;

392
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.700
and therefore, let me bethus bold with you

393
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.630
to give you over at thisfirst encounter,

394
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.470
unless you will accompanyme thither.

395
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.770
I pray you, sir, let himgo while the humour lasts.

396
00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.630
O' my word, an she knewhim as well as I do,

397
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.200
she would think scolding woulddo little good upon him.

398
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.500
She may perhaps call himhalf a score knaves or so.

399
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.430
That's nothing, an hebegin once, he'll rail inhis rope tricks.

400
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.870
I'll tell you what sir, anshe stand him but alittle,

401
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.530
he'll throw a figure inher face, so disfigure herwith it,

402
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.870
she shall have no more eyesto see withal than a cat.

403
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.130
You know him not, sir.

404
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:51.970
Tarry, Petruchio, I mustgo with thee,

405
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.800
for in Baptista's keep, mytreasure is.

406
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.230
He hath the jewel of mylife in hold--

407
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.500
his youngest daughter,beautiful Bianca--

408
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.970
and her withholds from meand other more,

409
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.930
suitors to her and rivalsin my love,

410
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.430
supposing it a thingimpossible

411
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.130
for those defects I havebefore rehearsed

412
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.430
that ever Katharina shallbe woo'd.

413
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.170
Therefore, this order hathBaptista ta'en

414
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.830
that none shall haveaccess unto Bianca

415
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.100
till Katharine the cursedhave got a husband.

416
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.170
Katharine the cursed, atitle for a maid, of alltitles the worst.

417
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:24.300
Now shall my friendPetruchio do me grace

418
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.700
and offer me disguised insober robes

419
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.900
to old Baptista as aschoolmaster

420
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.030
well seen in music toinstruct Bianca

421
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.400
that so I may by thisdevice

422
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.700
at least have leave andleisure to make love to her

423
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.630
and, unsuspected, courther by herself.

424
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.830
Here's no knavery.

425
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.230
See, to beguile the oldfolks,

426
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.370
how the young folks laytheir heads together.

427
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.770
Master, master, look aboutyou. Who goes there, ha?

428
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.030
Oh, oh, peace, Grumio.

429
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.230
It is the rival of mylove.

430
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.670
Petruchio, stand by awhile.

431
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.230
O, very well.

432
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.100
I have perused the note.

433
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.400
Hark you, sir,

434
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.530
I'll have them very fairlybound:

435
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.100
all books of love, seethat at any hand;

436
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.400
and see you read no otherlectures to her,

437
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.330
you understand me.

438
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.370
Over and beside SigniorBaptista's liberality,

439
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.430
I'll mend it with alargess.

440
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.830
Take your paper too,

441
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:14.770
and let me have them verywell perfumed,

442
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.770
for she is sweeter thanperfume itself

443
00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:17.870
to whom they go to.

444
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:18.970
Mm.

445
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.470
Nay, what will you read toher?

446
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.400
Whate'er I read to her,I'll plead for you

447
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.230
as for my patron, standyou so assured,

448
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.230
as firmly as yourself werestill in place.

449
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.800
Yea, and perhaps with moresuccessful words than you--

450
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.900
Hmm?

451
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.370
Unless you were a scholar,sir.

452
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.700
O this learning, what athing it is.

453
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.300
O this woodcock, what anass it is.

454
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.470
Grumio, mum.

455
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:37.900
God save you, SigniorGremio.

456
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.170
And you are well met,Signior Hortensio.

457
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.500
Trow you whither I amgoing?

458
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.830
To Baptista Minola.

459
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.530
I promised to inquirecarefully

460
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.500
about a schoolmaster forthe fair Bianca,

461
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.770
and by good fortune,

462
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.730
I have lighted well onthis young man,

463
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.400

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.970
so shall I no whit be behindin duty to fair Bianca,

469
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.170

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.270
Beloved of me, and that mydeeds shall prove.

471
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.670
And that his bags shallprove.

472
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:14.300
Gremio, 'tis now no timeto vent our love.

473
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.730
Listen to me, and if youspeak me fair,

474
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.200
I'll tell you newsindifferent good for either.

475
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.770
Here is a gentleman bychance I met,

476
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.030

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:26.970
will undertake to woocursed Katharine.

478
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.070
Huh?

479
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.300
Yea, and to marry her

480
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.270
if her dowry please.

481
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.930
So said, so done, is well.

482
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.530
Hortensio, have you toldhim all her faults?

483
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.600
I know she is an irksome,brawling scold.

484
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.430
If that be all, masters, Ihear no harm.

485
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.300
No, say'st me so, friend?

486
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.500
What countryman?

487
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.670
Born in Verona, oldAntonio's son.

488
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:47.770
My father dead--

489
00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:48.870
Oh.

490
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.070
my fortune lives for me,

491
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.170
and I do hope good daysand long to see.

492
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.030
O sir, such a life, withsuch a wife, were strange,

493
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.270
but if you have a stomach,to't i' God's name.

494
00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.970
You shall have meassisting you in all.

495
00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.100
But will you woo thiswildcat?

496
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.200
Will I live?

497
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.330
Will he woo her? Aye, orI'll hang her.

498
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.070
Why came I hither but tothat intent?

499
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.870
Think you a little din candaunt mine ears?

500
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.300
Have I not in my timeheard lions roar?

501
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.630
Have I not heard the sea,puff'd up with winds,

502
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.770
rage like an angry boarchafed with sweat?

503
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.930
Have I not heard greatordnance in the field,

504
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.570
and heaven's artillerythunder in the skies?

505
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.770
Have I not, in a pitchedbattle, heard

506
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.930
loud 'larums, neighingsteeds, and trumpets' clang?

507
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.530
And do you tell me of awoman's tongue

508
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.100
that gives not half sogreat a blow to hear

509
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.900
as will a chestnut in afarmer's fire?

510
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.930
Tush, tush. Fear boys withbugs.

511
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.800
For he fears none.

512
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.270
Hortensio, hark,

513
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.170
this gentleman is happilyarrived,

514
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.200
my mind presumes, for hisown good and ours.

515
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.230
Mm, I promised we would becontributors

516
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.330
and bear his charge ofwooing, whatsoe'er.

517
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.500
And so we will, providedthat he win her.

518
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.800
I would I were as sure ofa good dinner.

519
00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.430
Gentlemen, God save you.

520
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.500
If I may be bold, tell me,I beseech you,

521
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.770
which is the readiest way

522
00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.770
to the house of SigniorBaptista Minola?

523
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.430
He that has the two fairdaughters?

524
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:07.530
Is't he you mean?

525
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.630
Even he, Biondello.

526
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.630
Hark you, sir, you meannot her to--

527
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:11.870
Perhaps, him and her, sir.

528
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.100
What have you to do?

529
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.770
Not her that chides, sir,at any hand, I pray.

530
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.330
I love no chiders, sir.

531
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:18.670
Biondello, let's away.

532
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:19.800
Well begun, Tranio.

533
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.470
Sir, a word ere you go.

534
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.330
Are you a suitor to themaid you talk of,

535
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:24.430
yea or no?

536
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.500
And if I be, sir, is itany offence?

537
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.530
No, if without more wordsyou will get you hence.

538
00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.600
Why, sir, I pray, are notthe streets as free

539
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.330
for me as for you?

540
00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:34.670
But so is not she.

541
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.270
For what reason, I beseechyou?

542
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.830
For this reason, if you'llknow,

543
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.970
that she's the choice loveof Signior Gremio.

544
00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.070
That she's the chosen ofSignior Hortensio.

545
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.700
Softly, my masters.

546
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.230
If you be gentlemen, do methis right.

547
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.870
Hear me with patience.

548
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.830
Baptista is a noblegentleman

549
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.400
to whom my father is notall unknown,

550
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.700
and were his daughterfairer than she is,

551
00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.230
she may more suitors haveand me for one.

552
00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.730
Fair Leda's daughter had athousand wooers.

553
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.870
Then well one more mayfair Bianca have,

554
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.070
and so she shall.

555
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.500
Lucentio shall make one,

556
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.130
though Paris came in hopeto speed alone.

557
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:10.170
What, this gentleman willout-talk us all.

558
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.300
Sir, give him head.

559
00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.630
I know he'll prove a jade.

560
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.730
Hortensio, to what end areall these words?

561
00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.370
Sir, let me be so bold asask you,

562
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.300
did you yet ever seeBaptista's daughter?

563
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.430
No, sir, but hear I dothat he hath two,

564
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.470
the one as famous for ascolding tongue

565
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.330
as is the other forbeauteous modesty.

566
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.700
Sir, sir, the first's forme.

567
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.830
Let her go by.

568
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.430
Yea, leave that labor togreat Hercules,

569
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.570
and let it be more thanAlcides' 12.

570
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.970
Sir, understand you thisof me in sooth.

571
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.800
The youngest daughter,whom you hearken for,

572
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.030
her father keeps from allaccess of suitors

573
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.500
and will not promise herto any man

574
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.700
until the elder sisterfirst be wed.

575
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.100

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.530
