00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.700


2
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.600
Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;

3
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.400
We have some secrets to confer about.

4
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.230
Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?

5
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.770
My gracious lord, that which I would discover

6
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.570
The law of friendship bids me to conceal;

7
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.170
But when I call to mind your gracious favours

8
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.000
Done to me, undeserving as I am,

9
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.730
My duty pricks me on to utter that

10
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.770
Which else no worldly good should draw from me.

11
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.270
Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,

12
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.070
This night intends to steal away your daughter:

13
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.600
Myself am one made privy to the plot.

14
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.270
I know you have determined to bestow her

15
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.970
On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;

16
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.170
And should she thus be stol'n away from you,

17
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.400
It would be much vexation to your age.

18
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.900
Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose

19
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.830
To cross my friend in his intended drift

20
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.700
Than, by concealing it, heap on your head

21
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.670
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,

22
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.670
Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.

23
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.830
Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;

24
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.870
Which to requite, command me while I live.

25
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.470
This love of theirs myself have often seen,

26
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.900
Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,

27
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.800
And oftentimes have purposed to forbid

28
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.030
Sir Valentine her company and my court:

29
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.930
But fearing lest my jealous aim might err

30
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.370
And so unworthily disgrace the man,

31
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.600
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,

32
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.300
I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find

33
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.100
That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.

34
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.130
And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,

35
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.170
I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,

36
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.300
The key whereof myself have ever kept;

37
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.330
And thence she cannot be convey'd away.

38
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.930
Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean

39
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.730
How he her chamber-window will ascend

40
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.900
And with a corded ladder fetch her down;

41
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.730
For which the youthful lover now is gone

42
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.330
And this way comes he with it presently;

43
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.200
Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.

44
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.170
But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly

45
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.430
That my discovery be not aimed at;

46
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.030
For love of you, not hate unto my friend,

47
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.770
Hath made me publisher of this pretence.

48
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.400
Upon mine honour, he shall never know

49
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.000
That I had any light from thee of this.

50
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.870
Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.

51
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.800
Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?

52
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.330
Please it your grace, there is a messenger

53
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.530
That stays to bear my letters to my friends,

54
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.400
And I am going to deliver them.

55
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.770
Be they of much import?

56
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.130
The tenor of them doth but signify

57
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.230
My health and happy being at your court.

58
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.570
Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;

59
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.570
I am to break with thee of some affairs

60
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.830
That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.

61
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.970
'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought

62
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.230
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.

63
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.670
I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match

64
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.400
Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman

65
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.130
Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities

66
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.730
Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:

67
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.370
Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?

68
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.170
No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,

69
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.800
Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,

70
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.430
Neither regarding that she is my child

71
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.030
Nor fearing me as if I were her father;

72
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.400
And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,

73
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.470
Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;

74
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.630
And, where I thought the remnant of mine age

75
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.930
Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,

76
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.900
I now am full resolved to take a wife

77
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.270
And turn her out to who will take her in:

78
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.700
Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;

79
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.170
For me and my possessions she esteems not.

80
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.870
What would your Grace have me to do in this?

81
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.400
There is a lady in city here

82
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.630
Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy

83
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.900
And nought esteems my aged eloquence:

84
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.000
For long agone I have forgot to court;

85
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.370
Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--

86
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.500
Now therefore, when I have thee to my tutor

87
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.030
How and which way I may bestow myself

88
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.670
To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.

89
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.800
Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:

90
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.830
Dumb jewels often in their silent kind

91
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.400
More than quick words do move a woman's mind.

92
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.600
But she did scorn a present that I sent her.

93
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.270
A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.

94
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.100
Send her another; never give her o'er;

95
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.600
For scorn at first makes after-love the more.

96
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.200
If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,

97
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.700
But rather to beget more love in you:

98
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.930
If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;

99
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.330
For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.

100
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.670
Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;

101
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.200
For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'

102
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.230
Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;

103
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.630
Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.

104
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.130
That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,

105
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.400
If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.

106
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.100
But she I mean is promised by her friends

107
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.930
Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,

108
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.800
And kept severely from resort of men,

109
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.930
That no man hath access by day to her.

110
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.300
Why, then, I would resort to her by night.

111
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.400
Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,

112
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.200
That no man hath recourse to her by night.

113
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.870
What lets but one may enter at her window?

114
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.030
Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,

115
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.200
And built so shelving that one cannot climb it

116
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.670
Without apparent hazard of his life.

117
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:57.400
Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,

118
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.300
To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,

119
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.170
Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,

120
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.800
So bold Leander would adventure it.

121
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.300
Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,

122
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.370
Advise me where I may have such a ladder.

123
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.570
When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.

124
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.330
This very night; for Love is like a child,

125
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.030
That longs for every thing that he can come by.

126
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.270
By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.

127
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.700
But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:

128
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.330
How shall I best convey the ladder thither?

129
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.030
It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it

130
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:35.330
Under a cloak that is of any length.

131
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:41.800
A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?

132
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.930
Ay, my good lord.

133
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.170
Then let me see thy cloak:

134
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.670
I'll get me one of such another length.

135
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.100
Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.

136
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.500
How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?

137
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.770
Let me feel thy cloak upon me.

138
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.370
What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!

139
00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.930
And here an engine fit for my proceeding.

140
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:41.530
I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.

141
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.170
'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,

142
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:47.230
And slaves they are to me that send them flying:

143
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.230
O, could their master come and go as lightly,

144
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.970
Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!

145
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.500
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:

146
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.800
While I, their king, that hither them importune,

147
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.030
Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,

148
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:08.500
Because myself do want my servants' fortune:

149
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.770
I curse myself, for they are sent by me,

150
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:17.700
That they should harbour where their lord would be.'

151
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.600
What's here?

152
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:28.470
'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'

153
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:34.930
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.

154
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:39.530
Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,--

155
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.100
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car

156
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.670
And with thy daring folly burn the world?

157
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.100
Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?

158
00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.430
Go, base intruder! overweening slave!

159
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.730
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,

160
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.770
And think my patience, more than thy desert,

161
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.200
Is privilege for thy departure hence:

162
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.070
Thank me for this more than for all the favours

163
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.430
Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.

164
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.130
But if thou linger in my territories

165
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.570
Longer than swiftest expedition

166
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:14.370
Will give thee time to leave our royal court,

167
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.930
By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love

168
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.070
I ever bore my daughter or thyself.

169
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:24.400
Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;

170
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:32.700
But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.

171
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:51.030
And why not death rather than living torment?

172
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:55.570
To die is to be banish'd from myself;

173
00:10:55.570 --> 00:11:01.170
And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her

174
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:06.430
Is self from self: a deadly banishment!

175
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:19.070
What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?

176
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:25.100
What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?

177
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.770
Unless it be to think that she is by

178
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.970
And feed upon the shadow of perfection

179
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.370
Except I be by Silvia in the night,

180
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.600
There is no music in the nightingale;

181
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.030
Unless I look on Silvia in the day,

182
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:46.070
There is no day for me to look upon;

183
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:51.130
She is my essence, and I leave to be,

184
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:54.370
If I be not by her fair influence

185
00:11:54.370 --> 00:12:05.270
Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.

186
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:09.630
I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:

187
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.130
Tarry I here, I but attend on death:

188
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.030
But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.

189
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.200
Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.

190
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.430
Soho, soho!

191
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:20.530
What does't thou see?

192
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:21.600
Him that we seek: there's not a hair on's head

193
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.230
but 'tis a Valentine.

194
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:26.430
Valentine?

195
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.370
No.

196
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.170
Who then? his spirit?

197
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:28.800
Neither.

198
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.470
What then?

199
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:30.400
Nothing.

200
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.270
Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?

201
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.100
Who wouldst thou strike?

202
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:32.830
Nothing.

203
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:33.870
Villain, forbear.

204
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:34.930
Why, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,--

205
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.270
Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.

206
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.100
My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,

207
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.270
So much of bad already hath possess'd them.

208
00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:42.900
Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,

209
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.270
For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.

210
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:45.930
Is Silvia dead?

211
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:46.870
No, Valentine.

212
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.870
No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.

213
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:49.630
Hath she forsworn me?

214
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:50.700
No, Valentine.

215
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.930
No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.

216
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.030
What is your news?

217
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:58.070
Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.

218
00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:01.700
That thou art banished--O, that's the news!--

219
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.230
From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.

220
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.470
O, I have fed upon this woe already,

221
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.030
And now excess of it will make me surfeit.

222
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.030
Doth Silvia know that I am banished?

223
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.770
Ay, ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom--

224
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.900
Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force--

225
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:19.270
A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:

226
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.430
Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;

227
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.970
With them, upon her knees, her humble self;

228
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.670
Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them

229
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:30.330
As if but now they waxed pale for woe:

230
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.330
But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,

231
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.900
Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,

232
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.600
Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;

233
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.130
But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.

234
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:44.630
Besides, her intercession chafed him so,

235
00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.630
When she for thy repeal was suppliant,

236
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.270
That to close prison he commanded her,

237
00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.700
With many bitter threats of biding there.

238
00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.100
No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st

239
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.730
Have some malignant power upon my life:

240
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.430
If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,

241
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:58.000
As ending anthem of my endless dolour.

242
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.230
Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,

243
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:03.030
And study help for that which thou lament'st.

244
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.370
Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.

245
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.730
Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;

246
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.600
Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.

247
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.230
Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that

248
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.870
And manage it against despairing thoughts.

249
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.000
Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;

250
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.900
Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd

251
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.270
Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.

252
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.370
The time now serves not to expostulate:

253
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.400
Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate;

254
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.400
And, ere I part with thee, confer at large

255
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.430
Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.

256
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.100
As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself,

257
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.030
Regard thy danger, and along with me!

258
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.930
I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,

259
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:44.500
Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.

260
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.830
Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.

261
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:53.200
O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!

262
00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.600
I am but a fool;

263
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:06.530
and yet I have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave:

264
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:12.930
but that's all one, if he be but one knave.

265
00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:16.600
He lives not now that knows me to be in love;

266
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.870
yet I am in love;

267
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.570
but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me;

268
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:31.270
nor who 'tis I love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman,

269
00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:39.170
I will not tell myself; and yet 'tis a milkmaid;

270
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.270
yet 'tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips;

271
00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.430
yet 'tis a maid, for she is her master's maid,

272
00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.530
and serves for wages.

273
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:52.970
She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel;

274
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.430
which is much in a bare Christian.

275
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:59.870
Here is the cate-log of her condition.

276
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.770
'Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.'

277
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.700
Why, a horse can do no more: nay, a horse cannot fetch,

278
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.730
but only carry; therefore is she better than a jade.

279
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:13.470
'Item: She can milk;' look you, a sweet virtue in a maid

280
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.100
with clean hands.

281
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.930
How now, Signior Launce! what news with your mastership?

282
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:22.630
With my master's ship? why, it is at sea.

283
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.570
Well, your old vice still; mistake the word.

284
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:26.530
What news, then, in your paper?

285
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.570
The blackest news that ever thou heardest.

286
00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.700
Why, man, how black?

287
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.030
Why, as black as ink.

288
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.030
Let me read them.

289
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.830
Fie on thee, jolt-head! thou canst not read.

290
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.570
Thou liest; I can.

291
00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:38.270
I will try thee. Tell me this: who begot thee?

292
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.570
Marry, the son of my grandfather.

293
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.730
O illiterate loiterer! it was the son of thy grandmother:

294
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.500
this proves that thou canst not read.

295
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.370
Come, fool, come; try me in thy paper.

296
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.230
There; and St. Nicholas be thy speed!

297
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.500
'Imprimis: She can milk.'

298
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.470
Ay, that she can.

299
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.230
'Item: She brews good ale.'

300
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.700
And thereof comes the proverb:

301
00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.970
'Blessing of your heart, you brew good ale.'

302
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.400
Item: She can sew.'

303
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.400
That's as much as to say, Can she so?

304
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.100
'Item: She can knit.'

305
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.970
What need a man care for a stock with a wench,

306
00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:08.600
when she can knit him a stock?

307
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.400
'Item: She can wash and scour.'

308
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.400
A special virtue:

309
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.800
for then she need not be washed and scoured.

310
00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.270
'Item: She can spin.'

311
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.300
Then may I set the world on wheels,

312
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.770
when she can spin for her living.

313
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.300
'Item: She hath many nameless virtues.'

314
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.530
That's as much as to say, bastard virtues;

315
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:24.770
that, indeed, know not their fathers

316
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.500
and therefore have no names.

317
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.470
'Here follow her vices.'

318
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.300
Close at the heels of her virtues.

319
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.830
'Item: She is not to be kissed fasting

320
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.030
in respect of her breath.'

321
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.700
Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast. Read on.

322
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.670
'Item: She hath a sweet mouth.'

323
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.600
That makes amends for her sour breath.

324
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.300
'Item: She doth talk in her sleep.'

325
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:47.070
It's no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.

326
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.000
'Item: She is slow in words.'

327
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.800
O villain, that set this down among her vices!

328
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.500
To be slow in words is a woman's only virtue:

329
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.900
I pray thee, out with't, and place it for her chief virtue.

330
00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.730
'Item: She is proud.'

331
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.470
Out with that too; it was Eve's legacy,

332
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:03.630
and cannot be ta'en from her.

333
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.400
'Item: She hath no teeth.'

334
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.600
I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.

335
00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.800
'Item: She is curst.'

336
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.670
Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.

337
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.200
'Item: She will often praise her liquor.'

338
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.930
If her liquor be good, she shall: if she will not, I will;

339
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:22.500
for good things should be praised.

340
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.530
'Item: She is too liberal.'

341
00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.770
Of her tongue she cannot be,

342
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.070
for that's writ down she is slow of;

343
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:33.870
of her purse she shall not, for that I'll keep shut:

344
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:38.700
now, of another thing she may, and that cannot I help.

345
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.830
Well, proceed.

346
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.200
'Item: She hath more hair than wit,

347
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.300
and more faults than hairs, and more wealth than faults.'

348
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.170
Stop there; I'll have her: she was mine, and not mine,

349
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:48.730
twice or thrice in that last article.

350
00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.770
Rehearse that once more.

351
00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.530
'Item: She hath more hair than wit,'--

352
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:56.330
More hair than wit? It may be; I'll prove it.

353
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.470
The cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore

354
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.030
it is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit

355
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.070
is more than the wit, for the greater hides the less.

356
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.930
What's next?

357
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.870
'And more faults than hairs,'--

358
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:07.870
That's monstrous: O, that that were out!

359
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.900
'And more wealth than faults.'

360
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.200
Why, that word makes the faults gracious.

361
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.870
Well, I'll have her; and if it be a match,

362
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.030
as nothing is impossible,--

363
00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.130
What then?

364
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:24.700
Why, then will I tell thee--that thy master stays

365
00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:30.770
for thee at the North-gate.

366
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.930
For me?

367
00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.000
For thee! ay, who art thou?

368
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.030
he hath stayed for a better man than thee.

369
00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:35.100
And must I go to him?

370
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.300
Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so long

371
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.670
that going will scarce serve the turn.

372
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.930
Why didst not tell me sooner? pox of your love letters!

373
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.370
Now will he be swinged for reading my letter;

374
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:46.930
an unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into secrets!

375
00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.200
I'll after, to rejoice in the boy's correction.

376
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.300
Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,

377
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.770
Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.

378
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.400
Since his exile she hath despised me most,

379
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.770
Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,

380
00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.270
That I am desperate of obtaining her.

381
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.600
This weak impress of love is as a figure

382
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.000
Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat

383
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.730
Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.

384
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.670
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts

385
00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.100
And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.

386
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.830
How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman

387
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.600
According to our proclamation gone?

388
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.870
Gone, my good lord.

389
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.030
My daughter takes his going grievously.

390
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:37.900
A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.

391
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.200
So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.

392
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.400
Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--

393
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.970
For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--

394
00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.270
Makes me the better to confer with thee.

395
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:51.700
Longer than I prove loyal to your grace

396
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.730
Let me not live to look upon your grace.

397
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:56.770
Thou know'st how willingly I would effect

398
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.670
The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.

399
00:20:58.670 --> 00:20:59.700
I do, my lord.

400
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.000
And also, I think, thou art not ignorant

401
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.030
How she opposes her against my will

402
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.130
She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.

403
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:10.570
Ay, and perversely she persevers so.

404
00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.800
What might we do to make the girl forget

405
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.430
The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?

406
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.700
The best way is to slander Valentine

407
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.400
With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,

408
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.870
Three things that women highly hold in hate.

409
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.830
Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.

410
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.130
Ay, if his enemy deliver it:

411
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.430
Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken

412
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:35.570
By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.

413
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:43.470
Then you must undertake to slander him.

414
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:47.930
And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:

415
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.030
'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,

416
00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.230
Especially against his very friend.

417
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.570
Where your good word cannot advantage him,

418
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.330
Your slander never can endamage him;

419
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:57.730
Therefore the office is indifferent,

420
00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:04.830
Being entreated to it by your friend.

421
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:08.170
You have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do it

422
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.630
By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,

423
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:15.970
She shall not long continue love to him.

424
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.170
But say this weed her love from Valentine,

425
00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:22.170
It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.

426
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.370
Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,

427
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:27.730
Lest it should ravel and be good to none,

428
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.600
You must provide to bottom it on me;

429
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.370
Which must be done by praising me as much

430
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.670
As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.

431
00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.670
And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,

432
00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.670
Because we know, on Valentine's report,

433
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.670
You are already Love's firm votary

434
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.930
And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.

435
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.270
Upon this warrant shall you have access

436
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:49.430
Where you with Silvia may confer at large;

437
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:52.370
For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,

438
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:55.970
And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;

439
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.530
Where you may temper her by your persuasion

440
00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:02.870
To hate young Valentine and love my friend.

441
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:06.000
As much as I can do, I will effect:

442
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.070
But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;

443
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.270
You must lay lime to tangle her desires

444
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.730
By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes

445
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.270
Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.

446
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.170
Ay,

447
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.370
Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.

448
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.700
Say that upon the altar of her beauty

449
00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:28.430
You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:

450
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:30.700
Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears

451
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.570
Moist it again, and frame some feeling line

452
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:35.500
That may discover such integrity:

453
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.200
For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,

454
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.630
Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,

455
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.430
Make tigers tame and huge leviathans

456
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:49.700
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.

457
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.530
After your dire-lamenting elegies,

458
00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:54.030
Visit by night your lady's chamber-window

459
00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:56.700
With some sweet concert; to their instruments

460
00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.470
Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence

461
00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:03.700
Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.

462
00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.070
This, or else nothing, will inherit her.

463
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.970
This discipline shows thou hast been in love.

464
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.270
And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.

465
00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:17.270
Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,

466
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.530
Let us into the city presently

467
00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.330
To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.

468
00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.770
I have a sonnet that will serve the turn

469
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:26.870
To give the onset to thy good advice.

470
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:27.930
About it, gentlemen!

471
00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.670
We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,

472
00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.230
And afterward determine our proceedings.

473
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:39.900
Even now about it! I will pardon you.

474
00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:03.370
