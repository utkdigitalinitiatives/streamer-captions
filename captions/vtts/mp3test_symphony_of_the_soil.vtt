It is extremely rare</font>

01:00:22.608 --> 01:00:24.478
<font color="White">to have a planet
where there is soil.</font>

01:00:26.347 --> 01:00:28.434
<font color="White">As this living crust
that is smeared</font>

is not living.</font>

It's never known life,</font>

01:00:40.652 --> 01:00:43.000
<font color="White">And yet soil starts
forming on it</font>

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:46.695

grinding it to a fine dust,</font>

<font color="White">pulling out the nutrients,</font>

01:01:25.956 --> 01:01:27.521

into this water</font>

01:01:27.782 --> 01:01:30.782

right under the glacier.</font>

<font color="White">the trade winds, like today,</font>

<font color="White">through the area of
the decomposing organic matter,</font>

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:27.826

end products</font>

<font color="White">of the long-term
weathering of soils</font>

<font color="White">And these clays are
very, very small.</font>

01:10:38.739 --> 01:10:41.565

of the clays pack in there,</font>

01:10:41.826 --> 01:10:44.434
<font color="White">then the ability of that water
to move</font>

<font color="White">through the soil becomes
more and more limited.</font>

<font color="White">So if there’s any slope
to the land at all,</font>

01:10:50.347 --> 01:10:52.652
<font color="White">which there is on almost
all these lava flows,</font>

01:10:52.913 --> 01:10:55.565
<font color="White">then the water’s going to start
to move laterally,</font>

01:10:55.826 --> 01:10:58.086
<font color="White">and as it moves laterally then,</font>

01:10:58.347 --> 01:11:01.173
<font color="White">it will tend to drive
more erosion.</font>

01:11:03.434 --> 01:11:07.826
<font color="White">And it tends to create
fairly narrow steep canyons.</font>

01:11:08.043 --> 01:11:13.913
<font color="White">And then over time, the canyons
widen by the walls falling in.</font>

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.086
<font color="White">So as one moves across
the Hawaiian islands</font>

01:11:23.347 --> 01:11:25.608
<font color="White">and you’re getting to older
and older volcanoes,</font>

01:11:25.869 --> 01:11:28.434
<font color="White">those volcanoes are becoming
more and more</font>

01:11:28.695 --> 01:11:30.913
<font color="White">eroded as time goes on.</font>

01:11:31.217 --> 01:11:34.043
<font color="White">And that’s partly just
a function of the time</font>

01:11:34.304 --> 01:11:36.130
<font color="White">that rain has been
falling on them,</font>

01:11:36.391 --> 01:11:39.913
<font color="White">but it’s also driven by
this internal change</font>

01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:42.782
<font color="White">or development
in the soil structure</font>

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.304
<font color="White">and processes that are going on.</font>

01:12:03.782 --> 01:12:06.304
<font color="White">Soils have parents
just like we have parents.</font>

01:12:06.565 --> 01:12:08.217
<font color="White">So they came from somewhere.</font>

01:12:08.478 --> 01:12:13.391
<font color="White">Soils form from some material
that's in a particular location.</font>

01:12:13.652 --> 01:12:14.956
<font color="White">So in this location,</font>

01:12:15.173 --> 01:12:17.217
<font color="White">we had windblown sediments
that came in,</font>

01:12:17.478 --> 01:12:18.608
<font color="White">and you have
these loose sediments,</font>

01:12:18.869 --> 01:12:21.130
<font color="White">that are mostly
silt-sized particles,</font>

01:12:21.391 --> 01:12:23.521
<font color="White">called loess, L-O-E-S-S,</font>

01:12:23.782 --> 01:12:26.521
<font color="White">with some clay and some sand,
and then soil forms.</font>

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
<font color="White">That kind of material
is transported.</font>

01:12:30.217 --> 01:12:32.739
<font color="White">It's transported parent material
because it came in by the wind.</font>

01:12:33.217 --> 01:12:35.304
<font color="White">Other types of parent material
can come in by the water.</font>

01:12:35.565 --> 01:12:37.347
<font color="White">You can have
rivers that overflow,</font>

01:12:37.608 --> 01:12:41.000
<font color="White">like along the Mississippi,
they deposit alluvium.</font>

01:12:42.304 --> 01:12:43.652
<font color="White">Water rushes out
of a mountain range,</font>

01:12:43.913 --> 01:12:47.043
<font color="White">it might drop a lot of material
like in an alluvial fan,</font>

01:12:47.304 --> 01:12:49.086
<font color="White">when they deposit that material</font>

01:12:49.347 --> 01:12:51.826
<font color="White">new soils form in that material.</font>

01:12:52.913 --> 01:12:56.260
<font color="White">And then we also have
glacially-transported materials,</font>

01:12:56.521 --> 01:12:59.217
<font color="White">soils that formed
in glacial sediment.</font>

01:12:59.565 --> 01:13:02.608
<font color="White">When those glaciers melt,
they drop the material.</font>

01:13:02.913 --> 01:13:06.304
<font color="White">We also have soils that
are not transported.</font>

01:13:06.565 --> 01:13:07.956
<font color="White">We have soils
that form in place.</font>

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:09.478
<font color="White">Right where we're standing now,</font>

01:13:09.739 --> 01:13:12.652
<font color="White">we're on a butte,
kind of an old mountain range.</font>

01:13:12.913 --> 01:13:14.217
<font color="White">This particular mountain,</font>

01:13:14.478 --> 01:13:17.043
<font color="White">the soils formed
from rock in place.</font>

01:13:17.347 --> 01:13:20.565
<font color="White">It was exposed after
probably a million years,</font>

01:13:20.826 --> 01:13:24.173
<font color="White">we had a soil that actually
formed in that rock.</font>

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.565
<font color="White">And the easiest way to see this
is you can go to Europe...</font>

01:13:27.826 --> 01:13:30.913
<font color="White">I saw this castle and it was,
like 300 years old,</font>

01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:33.260
<font color="White">it was stone and at the surface,
you could see</font>

01:13:33.521 --> 01:13:34.739
<font color="White">a couple inches of soil
that had formed.</font>

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.086
<font color="White">Those kinds of soils take
a very long time to form.</font>

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.173
<font color="White">So transported soils,
I’m guessing 70%-75%</font>

01:13:42.434 --> 01:13:45.130
<font color="White">of our soils formed in
transported parent material.</font>

01:13:45.391 --> 01:13:48.304
<font color="White">And then another 25% formed
in soils that are in place,</font>

01:13:48.565 --> 01:13:51.217
<font color="White">lot of those
are up in the mountains.</font>

01:13:52.608 --> 01:13:55.086
<font color="White">There's an incredible diversity
of soils on the planet.</font>

01:13:55.347 --> 01:13:57.043
<font color="White">There’s not just
one kind of good dirt.</font>

01:13:57.304 --> 01:13:58.869
<font color="White">If you go to different climates,</font>

01:13:59.086 --> 01:14:00.826
<font color="White">you'll find very different
kinds of soils,</font>

01:14:01.043 --> 01:14:03.217
<font color="White">and consequently, different
kinds of plant communities</font>

01:14:03.478 --> 01:14:05.217
<font color="White">that are adapted to
growing on those soils.</font>

01:14:06.652 --> 01:14:08.000
<font color="White">A lot of people look at a forest
and think "oh wow,"</font>

01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:09.913
<font color="White">"forest soil’s the most
productive in the world."</font>

01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:13.000
<font color="White">Most of the organic matter
is in the standing vegetation,</font>

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:14.695
<font color="White">it’s not in the soil.</font>

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.478
<font color="White">Prairie soil’s the most productive.</font>

01:14:18.391 --> 01:14:20.130
<font color="White">It's that vegetation,</font>

01:14:20.608 --> 01:14:23.304
<font color="White">the grasses that have
these deep fibrous roots,</font>

01:14:23.565 --> 01:14:26.130
<font color="White">and they're constantly
sloughing, dying off,</font>

01:14:26.391 --> 01:14:27.869
<font color="White">putting more organic matter
in the soil.</font>

01:14:28.086 --> 01:14:29.347
<font color="White">That’s what you have here.</font>

01:14:29.608 --> 01:14:32.260
<font color="White">They make
the most productive soils.</font>

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.434
<font color="White">Because of
the prairie soil formation,</font>

01:14:35.695 --> 01:14:38.173
<font color="White">they have really good structure,
water can infiltrate easily</font>

01:14:38.434 --> 01:14:40.608
<font color="White">from the surface
down into the soil.</font>

01:14:40.869 --> 01:14:43.391
<font color="White">They store water well
in most cases.</font>

01:14:43.652 --> 01:14:45.782
<font color="White">In the world maybe 7%</font>

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.391
<font color="White">of the landscape
is in mollisols.</font>

01:14:51.869 --> 01:14:55.086
<font color="White">In the United States,
we have about 22.5%.</font>

01:14:55.434 --> 01:14:59.434
<font color="White">So we have more,
we have 3 times our fair share.</font>

01:15:01.869 --> 01:15:03.043
<font color="White">Alfisols.</font>

01:15:03.304 --> 01:15:06.434
<font color="White">They may be in general the
second most productive order.</font>

01:15:06.695 --> 01:15:09.130
<font color="White">In the world,
there’s probably 12%.</font>

01:15:09.434 --> 01:15:12.826
<font color="White">The United States lucked out,
we have 18% -19%,</font>

01:15:13.043 --> 01:15:14.956
<font color="White">17%, alfisols.</font>

01:15:15.217 --> 01:15:16.782
<font color="White">So we have
more than our average.</font>

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.521
<font color="White">Well, if we have 22.5% mollisols
in the US,</font>

01:15:19.782 --> 01:15:22.000
<font color="White">and another 18% alfisols,</font>

01:15:22.434 --> 01:15:25.434
<font color="White">40% of our soils
are the two best orders.</font>

01:15:25.695 --> 01:15:27.086
<font color="White">That's incredible.</font>

01:16:45.521 --> 01:16:48.434
<font color="White">Soil is the interface between
biology and geology.</font>

01:16:48.695 --> 01:16:51.347
<font color="White">It’s sort of the living skin
of the Earth.</font>

01:16:53.434 --> 01:16:55.173
<font color="White">We're in the Palouse,
and we're in a wheat field,</font>

01:16:55.434 --> 01:16:57.391
<font color="White">and most people would think,
"we're on top of a soil."</font>

01:16:57.652 --> 01:17:00.913
<font color="White">And this is what most people
see in soil. They walk on it,</font>

01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:03.869
<font color="White">but if you look more closely
and you look beneath me,</font>

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:06.782
<font color="White">we have 30-40 inches
of today’s soil</font>

01:17:07.173 --> 01:17:08.478
<font color="White">that’s being farmed</font>

01:17:08.739 --> 01:17:11.956
<font color="White">over 30 inches
of a prehistoric soil,</font>

01:17:12.304 --> 01:17:14.652
<font color="White">over another 30 inches
of prehistoric soil</font>

01:17:14.913 --> 01:17:17.304
<font color="White">and it just keeps going down.</font>

01:17:27.695 --> 01:17:29.739
<font color="White">As I stand on a piece of land,</font>

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:33.782
<font color="White">it’s easy for me to forget that
the soil under my feet</font>

01:17:34.434 --> 01:17:36.043
<font color="White">is only 50% solid.</font>

01:17:40.043 --> 01:17:44.000
<font color="White">50% of that soil is actually
empty spaces,</font>

01:17:44.217 --> 01:17:47.086
<font color="White">the soil pores
that are filled with air,</font>

01:17:47.347 --> 01:17:50.739
<font color="White">water vapor and
a small amount of liquid water.</font>

01:17:51.782 --> 01:17:53.826
<font color="White">And it is within these spaces</font>

01:17:54.043 --> 01:17:56.652
<font color="White">that living organisms
actually thrive.</font>

01:17:57.652 --> 01:18:01.086
<font color="White">It is this small fraction that
keeps nutrients flowing,</font>

01:18:01.347 --> 01:18:04.391
<font color="White">regulates and drives
the functioning of the soil,</font>

01:18:04.652 --> 01:18:08.391
<font color="White">and therefore, the functioning
of the whole ecosystem.</font>

01:18:25.913 --> 01:18:29.086
<font color="White">It's Times Square
on New Year's Eve</font>

01:18:29.347 --> 01:18:31.173
<font color="White">all the time in the soil.</font>

01:18:31.434 --> 01:18:34.043
<font color="White">When you take that soil and
you put it under a microscope</font>

01:18:34.304 --> 01:18:36.217
<font color="White">and you start looking,</font>

01:18:36.478 --> 01:18:38.434
<font color="White">it’s a place full of life.</font>

01:18:50.086 --> 01:18:53.217
<font color="White">There’s so many microorganisms
in one gram of soil</font>

01:18:53.478 --> 01:18:56.956
<font color="White">that 70% to 80% of them still
have never been identified.</font>

01:18:57.173 --> 01:19:01.000
<font color="White">So literally you have...
Soil is more properly viewed</font>

01:19:01.217 --> 01:19:04.782
<font color="White">is sort of like this ecosystem.
It’s a living thing.</font>

01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:37.739
<font color="White">Carbon dioxide in the air
is captured by plants,</font>

01:19:38.434 --> 01:19:41.000
<font color="White">and using the power of sunlight,</font>

01:19:41.217 --> 01:19:45.000
<font color="White">this carbon dioxide is
transformed into carbohydrates</font>

01:19:45.217 --> 01:19:47.913
<font color="White">by the process
called photosynthesis.</font>

01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:01.913
<font color="White">Once carbon is fixed
into carbohydrates,</font>

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:04.956
<font color="White">it is available to become
the many molecules</font>

01:20:05.173 --> 01:20:06.869
<font color="White">that feed and form</font>

01:20:07.086 --> 01:20:09.434
<font color="White">the living organisms
of the soil.</font>

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.260
<font color="White">When you're looking at the
above ground part of the plant</font>

01:20:17.521 --> 01:20:21.130
<font color="White">that most people see and
the roots down into the soil,</font>

01:20:21.521 --> 01:20:23.652
<font color="White">that plant is putting out foods.</font>

01:20:23.913 --> 01:20:27.000
<font color="White">Every bit of the surface
of that plant</font>

01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:29.173
<font color="White">is pouring out foods</font>

01:20:29.434 --> 01:20:31.608
<font color="White">to feed the proper sets
of microorganisms</font>

01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:34.652
<font color="White">in the balances
that the plant requires.</font>

01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:38.000
<font color="White">So it's putting out what's
called in the scientific world,</font>

01:20:38.217 --> 01:20:39.130
<font color="White">"exudates."</font>

01:20:40.130 --> 01:20:42.130
<font color="White">The fruit, the blossoms,</font>

01:20:42.391 --> 01:20:44.173
<font color="White">all of the surface leaves, bark,</font>

01:20:44.434 --> 01:20:46.521
<font color="White">stems, everything on that plant</font>

01:20:46.782 --> 01:20:48.565
<font color="White">is putting out an exudate</font>

01:20:48.869 --> 01:20:52.434
<font color="White">for the purpose of
growing bacteria and fungi.</font>

01:20:52.695 --> 01:20:54.565
<font color="White">And that's really
the only reason</font>

01:20:54.826 --> 01:20:56.304
<font color="White">that plants are putting
those foods out.</font>

01:20:56.565 --> 01:20:58.826
<font color="White">Down in the root system,
all of the roots</font>

01:20:59.043 --> 01:21:00.000
<font color="White">the structural roots,</font>

01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:02.956
<font color="White">the lateral roots, the
root hairs, the fine roots...</font>

01:21:03.173 --> 01:21:05.217
<font color="White">They're all putting out foods</font>

01:21:05.478 --> 01:21:07.217
<font color="White">to feed the bacteria and fungi.</font>

01:21:07.652 --> 01:21:09.739
<font color="White">And of course
if a plant was putting out food</font>

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.739
<font color="White">that would feed
a disease-causing organism,</font>

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.478
<font color="White">the plant would be dead.</font>

01:21:14.956 --> 01:21:17.565
<font color="White">So when this plant growing
its roots through the soil</font>

01:21:17.826 --> 01:21:19.782
<font color="White">starts pumping out
all this food,</font>

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.086
<font color="White">the bacteria grow,
the fungi grow,</font>

01:21:22.347 --> 01:21:24.739
<font color="White">and we have now a million</font>

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.304
<font color="White">million bacteria per teaspoon</font>

01:21:27.565 --> 01:21:29.391
<font color="White">of soil around that root system.</font>

01:21:29.652 --> 01:21:33.086
<font color="White">We have miles and miles
and miles of fungal hyphae</font>

01:21:33.347 --> 01:21:35.000
<font color="White">around the root system.</font>

01:21:35.217 --> 01:21:37.000
<font color="White">So we've got a castle wall.</font>

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:38.173
<font color="White">We're protecting.</font>

01:21:38.434 --> 01:21:41.130
<font color="White">And if the plant's
doing that, how's it doing it?</font>

01:21:41.478 --> 01:21:44.043
<font color="White">Through the exudates, the foods
that it's putting out.</font>

01:21:44.304 --> 01:21:45.478
<font color="White">Simple sugars,</font>

01:21:46.869 --> 01:21:47.956
<font color="White">protein,</font>

01:21:48.782 --> 01:21:50.434
<font color="White">and then carbohydrate.</font>

01:21:51.826 --> 01:21:53.652
<font color="White">What is that a recipe for?</font>

01:21:53.956 --> 01:21:55.347
<font color="White">Cakes and cookies.</font>

01:21:56.434 --> 01:21:58.782
<font color="White">So your plant is dumping
cakes and cookies</font>

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.608
<font color="White">all over its surface,
every single surface,</font>

01:22:00.869 --> 01:22:02.217
<font color="White">putting out cakes and cookies,</font>

01:22:02.478 --> 01:22:04.000
<font color="White">to feed these bacteria and fungi</font>

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:06.565
<font color="White">so they grow
to really high numbers</font>

01:22:06.826 --> 01:22:09.304
<font color="White">and are protecting
that root system</font>

01:22:09.565 --> 01:22:12.652
<font color="White">from all of the diseases that
would be trying to come in.</font>

01:22:13.086 --> 01:22:16.434
<font color="White">So in a healthy soil that
has the proper set of biology,</font>

01:22:17.434 --> 01:22:19.086
<font color="White">that plant is gonna
be able to grow</font>

01:22:19.347 --> 01:22:22.217
<font color="White">everything it needs
to grow to protect that root.</font>

01:22:22.478 --> 01:22:25.478
<font color="White">And if we've got all these
bacteria and fungi growing,</font>

01:22:25.739 --> 01:22:29.304
<font color="White">here come the predators
of the bacteria and fungi.</font>

01:22:29.565 --> 01:22:32.130
<font color="White">And when a protozoan
eats a bacterium,</font>

01:22:32.391 --> 01:22:36.217
<font color="White">it releases nutrients
in a now plant-available form.</font>

01:22:36.478 --> 01:22:38.434
<font color="White">They release nitrogen,
phosphorus,</font>

01:22:38.695 --> 01:22:40.521
<font color="White">sulfur, magnesium, calcium,</font>

01:22:40.782 --> 01:22:43.478
<font color="White">iron, zinc, copper, you name it.</font>

01:22:43.739 --> 01:22:46.695
<font color="White">The whole list of nutrients
that your plant requires...</font>

01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:49.956
<font color="White">They release those nutrients
in a plant available form.</font>

01:22:50.695 --> 01:22:54.391
<font color="White">As long as we maintain
that biology in the soil.</font>

01:22:55.086 --> 01:23:00.869
<font color="White">This is one part of a massive
oxidation-reduction cycle,</font>

01:23:01.086 --> 01:23:03.695
<font color="White">and so you reduce the carbon
from the atmosphere</font>

01:23:03.956 --> 01:23:05.000
<font color="White">via photosynthesis,</font>

01:23:05.521 --> 01:23:09.000
<font color="White">and then that carbon is released
back to the atmosphere</font>

01:23:09.217 --> 01:23:10.826
<font color="White">by oxidation.</font>

01:23:11.434 --> 01:23:13.086
<font color="White">And most of that oxidation</font>

01:23:13.347 --> 01:23:15.086
<font color="White">is driven by microorganisms</font>

01:23:15.347 --> 01:23:17.565
<font color="White">that reside within the soil.</font>

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
<font color="White">And so the soil is the zone</font>

01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:26.826
<font color="White">in which most organic material
produced by photosynthesis</font>

01:23:27.043 --> 01:23:29.000
<font color="White">is then broken down again</font>

01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:31.000
<font color="White">and the components
are being released.</font>

01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:34.913
<font color="White">So carbon dioxide’s being
released back to the atmosphere.</font>

01:23:35.130 --> 01:23:36.739
<font color="White">Nutrients are being released</font>

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.695
<font color="White">back into the biological cycle
to be used again.</font>

<font color="White">to great expense and
great amounts of energy,</font>

01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:12.217
<font color="White">or through the work of microbes,</font>

01:24:12.478 --> 01:24:14.000
<font color="White">especially fungi.</font>

the decomposing litter layer.</font>

<font color="White">called the mycelium,</font>

01:24:54.956 --> 01:24:58.521
<font color="White">penetrating through the crevices
where no plant could ever go,</font>

01:24:58.782 --> 01:25:02.173
<font color="White">finds that phosphorus atom
and pulls it out</font>

01:25:02.434 --> 01:25:06.826
<font color="White">through the crevices of the soil
to the mycorrhizal root tip.</font>

01:25:07.130 --> 01:25:11.000
<font color="White">Here, the phosphorus
is passed into the plant</font>

<font color="White">and then transported
through these fine roots.</font>

01:25:14.913 --> 01:25:17.260
<font color="White">The root grows
in this very special form,</font>

01:25:17.521 --> 01:25:18.826
<font color="White">very special shape.</font>

01:25:19.043 --> 01:25:22.173

<font color="White">at the root tips.</font>

01:25:38.347 --> 01:25:41.000
<font color="White">This is neither plant
nor fungus,</font>

01:25:41.217 --> 01:25:43.434
<font color="White">but the point
where fungi and plant</font>

01:25:43.695 --> 01:25:44.782
<font color="White">find each other and interact</font>

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
<font color="White">in this very intimate
relationship.</font>

01:25:48.173 --> 01:25:52.260
<font color="White">From here, that atom will move
through these fine roots</font>

01:25:52.521 --> 01:25:57.434
<font color="White">into thicker and thicker
and thicker roots,</font>

01:25:57.695 --> 01:25:59.869
<font color="White">until it joins
the secondary roots,</font>

01:26:00.086 --> 01:26:03.000
<font color="White">and it reaches into
the stream of sap</font>

01:26:03.217 --> 01:26:06.260
<font color="White">that is pulling
those nutrients up</font>

<font color="White">through the trunk</font>

01:26:09.347 --> 01:26:11.130
<font color="White">and into the canopy,</font>

01:26:11.565 --> 01:26:14.869
<font color="White">where the leaves
need these nutrients.</font>

01:26:19.695 --> 01:26:21.869
<font color="White">More than 90% of land plants</font>

01:26:22.173 --> 01:26:25.043
<font color="White">have mycorrhizae
of one kind of another.</font>

01:26:25.304 --> 01:26:26.347
<font color="White">So it is the rule.</font>

01:26:26.608 --> 01:26:28.260
<font color="White">There would have been
no colonization</font>

01:26:28.521 --> 01:26:30.782
<font color="White">of the land from the ocean</font>

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.695
<font color="White">without mycorrhizae,
without fungi.</font>

01:26:44.956 --> 01:26:48.043
<font color="White">Many of these fungi
produce a fruit body,</font>

01:26:48.304 --> 01:26:50.434
<font color="White">something we call a mushroom.</font>

01:27:32.434 --> 01:27:35.173
<font color="White">Nitrogen is a very
important element.</font>

01:27:35.434 --> 01:27:39.130
<font color="White">The green color of the plants,
the red color of our blood,</font>

01:27:39.391 --> 01:27:43.043
<font color="White">are signs of
our nitrogen content.</font>

01:27:45.521 --> 01:27:48.608
<font color="White">And yet nitrogen
is not easy to come by.</font>

01:27:49.043 --> 01:27:51.304
<font color="White">Nitrogen is available
in the air.</font>

01:27:52.086 --> 01:27:55.913
<font color="White">More than 70% of the actual
atmosphere that we breathe</font>

01:27:56.130 --> 01:27:59.521
<font color="White">is made of nitrogen, but
that nitrogen is very stable.</font>

01:27:59.782 --> 01:28:01.347
<font color="White">So it's difficult to activate</font>

01:28:01.608 --> 01:28:04.565
<font color="White">to become engaged
in the chemistry of life.</font>

01:28:04.956 --> 01:28:08.652
<font color="White">That activated nitrogen
out of the atmosphere</font>

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.652
<font color="White">is only available when there are
very large electric charges,</font>

01:28:15.695 --> 01:28:19.347
<font color="White">or through a very important
and unique trick</font>

01:28:19.608 --> 01:28:23.434
<font color="White">that only a very specific group
of bacteria can play.</font>

01:28:24.086 --> 01:28:25.217
<font color="White">Plants have learned</font>

01:28:25.478 --> 01:28:28.347
<font color="White">how to establish a relationship
with those bacteria,</font>

01:28:28.608 --> 01:28:31.217
<font color="White">in which the plants have
provided an environment</font>

01:28:31.478 --> 01:28:33.000
<font color="White">for the bacteria to grow,</font>

01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:36.086
<font color="White">and the bacteria are able
to take the nitrogen</font>

01:28:36.347 --> 01:28:40.869
<font color="White">from the atmosphere and
turn it into its available form.</font>

01:28:41.347 --> 01:28:45.000
<font color="White">This all happens inside
the roots of certain plants,</font>

01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:47.521
<font color="White">like these lupines we have here.</font>

01:28:48.173 --> 01:28:49.521
<font color="White">They are...</font>

01:28:50.391 --> 01:28:54.869
<font color="White">something like a tumor that
was induced by the bacteria.</font>

01:28:55.086 --> 01:28:58.304
<font color="White">The bacteria start talking
to the root of the plant,</font>

01:28:58.565 --> 01:29:02.000
<font color="White">the root of the plant responds
by growing around the bacterium</font>

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:04.391
<font color="White">and enclosing it inside.</font>

01:29:04.826 --> 01:29:07.565
<font color="White">The plant then
creates an environment</font>

01:29:07.826 --> 01:29:11.347
<font color="White">where these bacteria
can grow and can fix nitrogen.</font>

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.434
<font color="White">I've taken a nodule out
from the plant root,</font>

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
<font color="White">and I'm going to slice it</font>

01:29:19.217 --> 01:29:22.956
<font color="White">to reveal the place
where the bacteria are living,</font>

01:29:23.478 --> 01:29:27.000
<font color="White">where the nitrogen fixation
is actually happening.</font>

01:29:27.434 --> 01:29:28.608
<font color="White">You can see.</font>

01:29:28.869 --> 01:29:30.652
<font color="White">This red color</font>

01:29:30.913 --> 01:29:32.826
<font color="White">comes from a molecule</font>

01:29:33.043 --> 01:29:36.608
<font color="White">that is very close
to the hemoglobin in our blood.</font>

01:29:36.869 --> 01:29:40.521
<font color="White">If the activated nitrogen
comes in contact with oxygen,</font>

01:29:40.782 --> 01:29:43.130
<font color="White">it goes back
to its inactive form</font>

01:29:43.391 --> 01:29:46.260
<font color="White">and it’s impossible
for the plant to use it.</font>

01:29:47.217 --> 01:29:51.000
<font color="White">So for nitrogen to become
available to the plant world,</font>

01:29:51.304 --> 01:29:53.347
<font color="White">it has to be processed
by the bacteria</font>

01:29:53.608 --> 01:29:55.565
<font color="White">in the absence of oxygen.</font>

01:29:56.782 --> 01:30:01.000
<font color="White">And that's the great trick that
the plant learned how to do.</font>

01:30:01.826 --> 01:30:05.478
<font color="White">The peas, the beans,
all the legumes</font>

01:30:05.826 --> 01:30:07.608
<font color="White">have this type of nodule</font>

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.608
<font color="White">and make it possible for agriculture
to take place</font>

01:30:10.869 --> 01:30:13.695
<font color="White">without the introduction of
artificial nitrogen</font>

01:30:13.956 --> 01:30:15.304
<font color="White">from a fertilizer.</font>

01:30:20.130 --> 01:30:23.347
<font color="White">When you look at the real things
that we're dealing with</font>

01:30:23.608 --> 01:30:26.956
<font color="White">on this earth at a molecular,
cellular level,</font>

01:30:27.173 --> 01:30:28.782
<font color="White">change is life.</font>

01:30:29.913 --> 01:30:33.782
<font color="White">So we're in constant change,
we're in constant creation.</font>

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.521
<font color="White">It's that constant creation that
we get to help manage on a farm.</font>

01:30:59.739 --> 01:31:03.608
<font color="White">In a way, agriculture is
a dance with nature.</font>

01:31:03.869 --> 01:31:05.608
<font color="White">And it's about
timely intervention,</font>

01:31:05.869 --> 01:31:07.913
<font color="White">it's about understanding
the forces of nature,</font>

01:31:08.130 --> 01:31:09.608
<font color="White">maybe even learning
from the forest,</font>

01:31:09.869 --> 01:31:12.173
<font color="White">which is the world's
ultimate ecosystem.</font>

01:31:12.434 --> 01:31:15.434
<font color="White">And then, it's not exactly
improving on nature,</font>

01:31:15.695 --> 01:31:18.130
<font color="White">but it's recognizing that
you have to go with the laws,</font>

01:31:18.391 --> 01:31:21.217
<font color="White">but then if you act decisively
at the right moment,</font>

01:31:21.478 --> 01:31:23.043
<font color="White">you can get a surplus.</font>

01:31:23.347 --> 01:31:25.695
<font color="White">And in a way that's
what good farming is about.</font>

01:31:25.956 --> 01:31:28.565
<font color="White">And on this farm,
just to take this example,</font>

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.695
<font color="White">this land is in good heart.</font>

01:31:31.043 --> 01:31:34.217
<font color="White">It's been farmed organically
for 30 years.</font>

01:31:34.478 --> 01:31:37.260
<font color="White">This is the fifth time 'round
in the rotation.</font>

01:31:37.521 --> 01:31:39.217
<font color="White">So we grow clover grass,</font>

01:31:39.478 --> 01:31:42.000
<font color="White">which is what this is,
to build fertility,</font>

01:31:42.217 --> 01:31:44.434
<font color="White">and that is either grazed
by our dairy cows</font>

01:31:44.695 --> 01:31:47.304
<font color="White">or it's cut for silage,
which we feed in winter.</font>

01:31:47.565 --> 01:31:50.000
<font color="White">And then when it reaches
the peak of fertility</font>

01:31:50.217 --> 01:31:52.956
<font color="White">with very high levels
of organic matter or humus,</font>

01:31:53.173 --> 01:31:55.652
<font color="White">we then plow it and we grow
a crop of carrots</font>

01:31:55.913 --> 01:31:57.217
<font color="White">followed by a crop of oats.</font>

01:31:57.521 --> 01:31:58.608
<font color="White">If we look at this crop now</font>

01:31:58.869 --> 01:32:01.478
<font color="White">which we're just not quite ready
to harvest,</font>

01:32:01.739 --> 01:32:02.869
<font color="White">but it's getting there.</font>

01:32:03.086 --> 01:32:06.130
<font color="White">You got these carrots,
which as you can see,</font>

01:32:06.391 --> 01:32:09.434
<font color="White">have done reasonably well.</font>

01:32:09.695 --> 01:32:13.086
<font color="White">For me what is amazing
about this soil</font>

01:32:13.347 --> 01:32:16.260
<font color="White">is it just feels so alive</font>

01:32:16.521 --> 01:32:17.913
<font color="White">and so vital.</font>

01:32:26.869 --> 01:32:30.434
<font color="White">Mother Nature
is not growing a forest</font>

01:32:30.695 --> 01:32:33.260
<font color="White">the same way
she's growing a grassland</font>

01:32:33.521 --> 01:32:36.217
<font color="White">or the same way she grows
a riparian system.</font>

01:32:36.478 --> 01:32:39.000
<font color="White">What's so different about
what's going on in a wetlands</font>

01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:41.782
<font color="White">as compared to
that high-mountain meadow</font>

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.086
<font color="White">or the most beautiful meadow
you've ever seen in your life,</font>

01:32:45.347 --> 01:32:47.565
<font color="White">highly productive, or
that old-growth forest soil...</font>

01:32:47.826 --> 01:32:49.652
<font color="White">It's the biology in the soil.</font>

01:32:49.913 --> 01:32:51.782
<font color="White">That's what's different.</font>

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.869
<font color="White">Maybe we need to mimic
that system</font>

01:32:55.086 --> 01:32:57.913
<font color="White">in the crops
that we're trying to grow.</font>

01:32:58.391 --> 01:33:00.695
<font color="White">If you're growing strawberries,</font>

01:33:00.956 --> 01:33:03.260
<font color="White">what's the system that
you should be looking at</font>

01:33:03.521 --> 01:33:05.695
<font color="White">to determine
what should be in my soil,</font>

01:33:05.956 --> 01:33:07.217
<font color="White">in order to grow
these strawberries</font>

01:33:07.478 --> 01:33:09.956
<font color="White">without pesticides
or inorganic fertilizers?</font>

01:33:10.173 --> 01:33:13.260
<font color="White">Where do the strawberries exist
out there in the real world?</font>

01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:14.347
<font color="White">And most people,</font>

01:33:14.608 --> 01:33:17.173
<font color="White">when you ask them
that question, they're gonna:</font>

01:33:17.434 --> 01:33:20.739
<font color="White">"Real world? Strawberries grow
in the real world?"</font>

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:21.608
<font color="White">Yes...</font>

01:33:21.869 --> 01:33:23.086
<font color="White">Where do they come from
naturally,</font>

01:33:23.347 --> 01:33:25.521
<font color="White">where are they found
out in nature?</font>

01:33:25.782 --> 01:33:29.565
<font color="White">They're old-growth,
understory plant species.</font>

01:33:29.913 --> 01:33:32.739
<font color="White">So when you're trying to grow
a strawberry in sand</font>

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.478
<font color="White">that has been sterilized,</font>

01:33:35.956 --> 01:33:39.000
<font color="White">in what way does that
possibly mimic</font>

01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:41.478
<font color="White">that old-growth forest soil?</font>

01:33:42.304 --> 01:33:45.217
<font color="White">We’ve gotta get that diversity
back into our soils.</font>

01:33:45.478 --> 01:33:47.608
<font color="White">If you want to grow
those tomatoes or potatoes</font>

01:33:47.869 --> 01:33:49.695
<font color="White">or grapes
or whatever you’re growing,</font>

01:33:49.956 --> 01:33:54.000
<font color="White">we’ve got to get that kind of
diversity back into the soil.</font>

01:34:02.826 --> 01:34:04.086
<font color="White">What you’ve got
out in the field,</font>

01:34:04.347 --> 01:34:07.478
<font color="White">if you've got a really good
biological field going,</font>

01:34:07.782 --> 01:34:10.173
<font color="White">you should have 50,000 protozoa</font>

01:34:10.434 --> 01:34:15.217
<font color="White">out there per a unit of soil,
a good-sized unit of soil.</font>

01:34:15.478 --> 01:34:20.086
<font color="White">And each one of those protozoa
eat 10,000 bacteria a day.</font>

01:34:20.913 --> 01:34:23.521
<font color="White">Each one's eating
10,000 bacteria a day.</font>

01:34:23.782 --> 01:34:25.000
<font color="White">So what happens
when they eat them?</font>

01:34:25.217 --> 01:34:27.913
<font color="White">Well, they poop 'em out,
so we call it the "poop loop."</font>

01:34:28.130 --> 01:34:30.130
<font color="White">What happens with the poop
is it goes into the field,</font>

01:34:30.391 --> 01:34:32.130
<font color="White">it becomes a fertilizer,</font>

01:34:32.652 --> 01:34:35.826
<font color="White">which is your nitrogen reserve
out there in the soil.</font>

01:34:36.043 --> 01:34:39.000
<font color="White">And you should have a nitrogen
reserve like a bank account</font>

01:34:39.217 --> 01:34:40.695
<font color="White">of 150 to 200 pounds,</font>

01:34:40.956 --> 01:34:42.826
<font color="White">300 pounds of nitrogen per acre,</font>

01:34:43.043 --> 01:34:46.130
<font color="White">depending on how good
your biology's going.</font>

01:34:46.391 --> 01:34:48.869
<font color="White">Which is enough to grow anything
with no fertilization.</font>

01:34:50.391 --> 01:34:53.782
<font color="White">For most of the 10,000 years
of the history of agriculture,</font>

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000
<font color="White">nitrogen had been the most
important limiting factor</font>

01:34:58.260 --> 01:34:59.130
<font color="White">to productivity.</font>

01:35:01.130 --> 01:35:02.521
<font color="White">The way my grandfather farmed is</font>

01:35:02.782 --> 01:35:04.304
<font color="White">he'd break up
a piece of prairie,</font>

01:35:04.565 --> 01:35:07.521
<font color="White">and he would grow wheat and
oats usually, sometimes corn,</font>

01:35:07.782 --> 01:35:09.391
<font color="White">until the nutrients
were depleted.</font>

01:35:09.652 --> 01:35:11.565
<font color="White">Then he would break up
a new piece of prairie.</font>

01:35:12.391 --> 01:35:13.739
<font color="White">That's not ecological farming,</font>

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.913
<font color="White">that's sort of
slash-and-burn farming.</font>

01:35:17.130 --> 01:35:20.043
<font color="White">It wasn’t until
the early 20th century</font>

01:35:20.304 --> 01:35:22.826
<font color="White">that we were able to
increase the production</font>

01:35:23.043 --> 01:35:25.434
<font color="White">and the introduction of
nitrogen fertilizers</font>

01:35:25.739 --> 01:35:29.260
<font color="White">through a process called
the "Haber Bosch reaction."</font>

01:35:29.739 --> 01:35:30.826
<i><font color="White">[airplane motors]</font>

01:35:31.782 --> 01:35:33.478
<font color="White">Haber and Bosch, in Germany,</font>

01:35:33.739 --> 01:35:36.347
<font color="White">were looking for a better
explosive during the war,</font>

01:35:36.608 --> 01:35:38.130
<font color="White">and came up with this way
of breaking up</font>

01:35:38.391 --> 01:35:40.391
<font color="White">the bonds of nitrogen in the air</font>

01:35:40.652 --> 01:35:43.434
<font color="White">and turning that nitrogen
into an explosive form</font>

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.652
<font color="White">that is also
a plant available form.</font>

01:35:47.869 --> 01:35:50.565
<font color="White">So out of the chemistry
of war and bombs</font>

01:35:50.826 --> 01:35:54.130
<font color="White">came out the first
synthetic nitrogen fertilizer.</font>

01:35:54.956 --> 01:35:57.478
<i><font color="White">[motor on device starting up]</font>

01:35:57.869 --> 01:36:02.782
<font color="White">Then what happened was,
as World War II came to a close,</font>

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.173
<font color="White">and the fertilizers
became available</font>

01:36:05.434 --> 01:36:07.956
<font color="White">on a very inexpensive basis...</font>

01:36:08.521 --> 01:36:11.000
<font color="White">That was just at the time
when there...</font>

01:36:11.217 --> 01:36:13.739
<font color="White">was a limited amount
of new prairie to go to,</font>

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.391
<font color="White">and so it came as
the saving grace.</font>

01:36:16.826 --> 01:36:18.304
<font color="White">And I still remember my father</font>

01:36:18.565 --> 01:36:20.608
<font color="White">the first time he started
using fertilizer,</font>

01:36:20.869 --> 01:36:23.565
<font color="White">and he saw the response
that he got from that,</font>

01:36:23.826 --> 01:36:26.347
<font color="White">and he said we could never farm
without fertilizer again.</font>

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000
<font color="White">As we increase
the amount of nitrogen input</font>

01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:31.782
<font color="White">to natural ecosystems,</font>

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.782
<font color="White">what is the response of
the ecosystem itself to that?</font>

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000
<font color="White">I mean my father,</font>

01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:40.217
<font color="White">when he before he started
applying fertilizers,</font>

01:36:40.478 --> 01:36:42.956
<font color="White">he went to
our county extension agent,</font>

01:36:43.173 --> 01:36:45.347
<font color="White">he went to every farmer
whose judgment he trusted.</font>

01:36:45.608 --> 01:36:48.347
<font color="White">And his single question was,
"Is this gonna hurt my land?"</font>

01:36:49.826 --> 01:36:51.652
<font color="White">The use of nitrogen fertilizer</font>

01:36:51.913 --> 01:36:55.652
<font color="White">removed a limiting factor
from the agricultural ecosystem</font>

01:36:55.913 --> 01:37:00.217
<font color="White">so of course it yielded a very
high increase in productivity.</font>

01:37:00.695 --> 01:37:03.434
<font color="White">But it also produced
very high demands on the soil.</font>

01:37:03.695 --> 01:37:07.391
<font color="White">Demands in the form of
increased pesticide use,</font>

01:37:07.739 --> 01:37:09.304
<font color="White">the demand for other nutrients,</font>

01:37:09.565 --> 01:37:13.565
<font color="White">the demand for very high inputs
of water and fossil fuels</font>

01:37:13.956 --> 01:37:15.000
<font color="White">through all kinds of ways,</font>

01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:17.000
<font color="White">especially through
the mechanization</font>

01:37:17.217 --> 01:37:19.434
<font color="White">of the agricultural ecosystem.</font>

01:37:21.391 --> 01:37:24.217
<font color="White">All these elements put together
composed a regime</font>

01:37:24.478 --> 01:37:26.956
<font color="White">that is called
the Green Revolution.</font>

01:37:27.347 --> 01:37:29.652
<font color="White">And the poster children
for the Green Revolution</font>

01:37:29.913 --> 01:37:32.173

01:38:54.043 --> 01:38:56.260
<font color="White">But now, the first year
I stopped using the chemicals,</font>

01:38:56.521 --> 01:38:58.782
<font color="White">it went down just to half a ton.</font>

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.391
<font color="White">What happened was
that the soil was sick.</font>

01:39:01.652 --> 01:39:03.000
<font color="White">It was waterlogged,</font>

01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:05.565
<font color="White">it was compact due
to heavy machineries,</font>

01:39:05.826 --> 01:39:07.695
<font color="White">and I was not replacing
the carbon,</font>

01:39:07.956 --> 01:39:10.086
<font color="White">the biomass,
which I should have.</font>

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.391
<font color="White">Weeds were a problem,
they used to overshadow</font>

01:39:14.652 --> 01:39:15.956
<font color="White">all my crop,</font>

01:39:16.173 --> 01:39:19.913
<font color="White">but this year the weeds
are lower than the wheat.</font>

01:39:20.434 --> 01:39:24.130
<font color="White">And these weeds are basically,
they are wild clover,</font>

01:39:24.391 --> 01:39:25.608
<font color="White">which are a legume.</font>

01:39:26.782 --> 01:39:28.782
<font color="White">The legumes
are the lungs of the soil,</font>

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.565
<font color="White">so they catch all of the free
nitrogen and feed it back.</font>

01:39:32.826 --> 01:39:35.565
<font color="White">Nitrogen is the key
to a happy soil</font>

01:39:35.826 --> 01:39:37.260
<font color="White">and happy plants growing,</font>

01:39:37.521 --> 01:39:42.086
<font color="White">and nitrogen also
breaks down the carbon material</font>

01:39:42.347 --> 01:39:44.260
<font color="White">which we plow in our fields.</font>

01:39:52.739 --> 01:39:55.260
<font color="White">There are two very fundamentally
different outcomes</font>

01:39:55.521 --> 01:39:59.000
<font color="White">agriculture can bring to a soil.
It can improve it or degrade it.</font>

01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:01.869
<font color="White">Agriculture's not
necessarily destructive.</font>

01:40:02.086 --> 01:40:05.391
<font color="White">And the difference depends on
how one treats the soil.</font>

01:40:34.565 --> 01:40:36.869
<font color="White">If you look at the history of
many ancient civilizations,</font>

01:40:37.086 --> 01:40:39.130
<font color="White">they share a common storyline.</font>

01:40:39.391 --> 01:40:41.695
<font color="White">Farming starts in the valley
bottoms next to rivers,</font>

01:40:41.956 --> 01:40:44.347
<font color="White">in the soils that are
delivered by the rivers</font>

01:40:44.608 --> 01:40:47.565
<font color="White">from soils eroded off
of upland environments</font>

01:40:47.869 --> 01:40:50.782
<font color="White">that refreshes the fertility
of the valley bottoms</font>

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.391
<font color="White">very naturally.</font>

01:40:55.086 --> 01:40:57.913
<font color="White">Year after year, as floods come,
it deposits a new layer of silt,</font>

01:40:58.130 --> 01:40:59.739
<font color="White">the soil's built over time.</font>

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.347
<font color="White">Those are environments
that can sustain agriculture</font>

01:41:02.608 --> 01:41:03.652
<font color="White">for a long period of time</font>

01:41:03.913 --> 01:41:06.347
<font color="White">because the soil's
refreshed naturally.</font>

01:41:06.608 --> 01:41:07.608
<font color="White">In a very broad sense,</font>

01:41:07.869 --> 01:41:09.695
<font color="White">if you look at the history of
Western civilization,</font>

01:41:09.956 --> 01:41:10.739
<font color="White">you can trace it</font>

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.217
<font color="White">from the original
floodplain-based agriculture</font>

01:41:13.478 --> 01:41:17.304
<font color="White">along the Tigris and Euphrates
Rivers and the Nile River...</font>

01:41:19.739 --> 01:41:23.826
<font color="White">And many ancient civilizations
began in alluvial environments</font>

01:41:24.043 --> 01:41:26.565
<font color="White">as river-oriented civilizations.</font>

01:41:26.956 --> 01:41:29.826
<font color="White">What they found is that
they could grow more food</font>

01:41:30.043 --> 01:41:32.739
<font color="White">on smaller pieces of land
and support lots of people,</font>

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.739
<font color="White">so their populations
started to grow.</font>

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.478
<font color="White">And as populations spread up
into upland environments,</font>

01:41:37.739 --> 01:41:39.000
<font color="White">to the hillsides,</font>

01:41:39.217 --> 01:41:40.130
<font color="White">the same farming techniques</font>

01:41:40.391 --> 01:41:41.695
<font color="White">were brought up
onto the hillsides.</font>

01:41:41.956 --> 01:41:44.608
<font color="White">When you plow
on any kind of a slope,</font>

01:41:44.869 --> 01:41:47.086
<font color="White">it gradually pushes material
quite literally downhill</font>

01:41:47.347 --> 01:41:48.565
<font color="White">with each pass of the plow.</font>

01:41:48.869 --> 01:41:50.956
<font color="White">But it only takes
a few centuries</font>

01:41:51.173 --> 01:41:53.869
<font color="White">to a thousand years to erode
through the soils</font>

01:41:54.086 --> 01:41:56.782
<font color="White">with plow-based agriculture
on hillsides.</font>

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.956
<font color="White">And Greece sort of plowed
through their hillside soils,</font>

01:42:00.173 --> 01:42:01.130
<font color="White">and then to Rome,</font>

01:42:01.391 --> 01:42:03.608
<font color="White">and the Romans
really loved to plow.</font>

01:42:03.956 --> 01:42:06.173
<font color="White">They would plow
6 to 9 times a year,</font>

01:42:06.434 --> 01:42:08.304
<font color="White">depending on the kind of soil.</font>

01:42:08.565 --> 01:42:10.782
<font color="White">And they quite literally
plowed the soil right off</font>

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.347
<font color="White">Roman heartland over
the course of a few centuries...</font>

01:42:14.869 --> 01:42:16.000
<font color="White">A couple centuries B.C.</font>

01:42:16.217 --> 01:42:18.956
<font color="White">to the time that Rome
eventually collapsed.</font>

01:42:21.217 --> 01:42:21.826
<font color="White">Western Europe,</font>

01:42:22.043 --> 01:42:24.000
<font color="White">parts of which plowed
through their hillside soils,</font>

01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:26.130
<font color="White">and parts of which didn’t.</font>

01:42:30.173 --> 01:42:32.043
<font color="White">And then to North America,</font>

01:42:32.695 --> 01:42:35.130
<font color="White">the great American push West
was fueled, if you will,</font>

01:42:35.391 --> 01:42:37.608
<font color="White">by the exhaustion of soils
on the Eastern Seaboard,</font>

01:42:37.869 --> 01:42:39.826
<font color="White">as plantations and people
spread out West</font>

01:42:40.043 --> 01:42:42.434
<font color="White">in search of new fertile soils.</font>

01:42:43.434 --> 01:42:44.826
<font color="White">So one of the fundamental things
that happened</font>

01:42:45.043 --> 01:42:46.608
<font color="White">when the plow
came to the Plains,</font>

01:42:46.869 --> 01:42:49.043
<font color="White">whether in Europe
or North America,</font>

01:42:49.304 --> 01:42:51.652
<font color="White">was that by laying the soil
bare and exposed</font>

01:42:51.913 --> 01:42:54.000
<font color="White">for substantial portions
of the year,</font>

01:42:54.217 --> 01:42:56.739
<font color="White">wind and rain were able to
actually work erosionally</font>

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.956
<font color="White">much faster than they were
under native vegetation.</font>

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.391
<i><font color="White">[sound of heavy machinery]</font>

01:43:32.086 --> 01:43:35.173
<font color="White">When I was a kid growing up,
every spring in March</font>

01:43:35.434 --> 01:43:36.826
<font color="White">we’d have the spring runoff.</font>

01:43:37.043 --> 01:43:38.869
<font color="White">The mud and the water
used to come down</font>

01:43:39.086 --> 01:43:40.782
<font color="White">and boy, I’m telling you,</font>

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.478
<font color="White">this was back in the days
of conventional farming.</font>

01:43:43.739 --> 01:43:47.869
<font color="White">And all this water,
from these hilltops and</font>

01:43:48.086 --> 01:43:50.652
<font color="White">these side hills, would go right
down through around the house</font>

01:43:50.913 --> 01:43:52.565
<font color="White">just around the corner
down there.</font>

01:43:52.826 --> 01:43:55.000
<font color="White">A wall of water
came out of this draw,</font>

01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:57.217
<font color="White">three feet high,
hit the back of the house,</font>

01:43:57.478 --> 01:43:58.608
<font color="White">broke the windows out,</font>

01:43:58.869 --> 01:43:59.782
<font color="White">and it flooded the house,</font>

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.652
<font color="White">and they just opened the doors
and let the water run through.</font>

01:44:02.913 --> 01:44:06.826
<font color="White">After about several hours,
it turned to mud.</font>

01:44:07.043 --> 01:44:10.043
<font color="White">And then the mud would come.
Filled the cellar full of mud.</font>

01:44:10.304 --> 01:44:11.565
<font color="White">Every year.</font>

01:44:12.434 --> 01:44:14.260
<font color="White">And then I took a bulldozer and
I went around the house,</font>

01:44:14.521 --> 01:44:16.913
<font color="White">and I uncovered the house,
you know, from the mud.</font>

01:44:17.130 --> 01:44:19.695
<font color="White">All that came down
out of these fields,</font>

01:44:19.956 --> 01:44:21.260
<font color="White">and this is very, very typical</font>

01:44:21.521 --> 01:44:24.217
<font color="White">of the whole entire area
in these hills.</font>

01:44:24.913 --> 01:44:26.565
<font color="White">Then it became my turn to farm.</font>

01:44:26.826 --> 01:44:29.347
<font color="White">There just had to be
a better way to do it.</font>

01:44:32.956 --> 01:44:36.521
<font color="White">The direct seeding or no-till,
what it does,</font>

01:44:36.782 --> 01:44:38.869
<font color="White">is it’s like a big compost bed.</font>

01:44:39.173 --> 01:44:43.260
<font color="White">We leave all the standing
stubble and residue in place,</font>

01:44:43.521 --> 01:44:47.565
<font color="White">except we roll the straw out
of the seed row.</font>

01:44:47.956 --> 01:44:49.695
<font color="White">We put it in the center here.</font>

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.565
<font color="White">Because it’s not disturbed
from year to year,</font>

01:44:52.826 --> 01:44:55.304
<font color="White">you get worm activity going on</font>

01:44:55.695 --> 01:44:57.260
<font color="White">down here in the straw.</font>

01:44:57.652 --> 01:45:01.652
<font color="White">You’ll see the soil
is really granulated at the top,</font>

01:45:01.913 --> 01:45:04.739
<font color="White">and then as we go down
through the profile,</font>

01:45:05.391 --> 01:45:08.086
<font color="White">you’ll see here all the worm...
the worm holes.</font>

01:45:08.347 --> 01:45:11.260
<font color="White">And of course, the worm hole
is full of worm castings,</font>

01:45:11.521 --> 01:45:13.347
<font color="White">very very good fertilizer.</font>

01:45:14.739 --> 01:45:17.260
<font color="White">The earthworms aerate the soil,
they let the moisture go in,</font>

01:45:17.521 --> 01:45:19.782
<font color="White">and then they provide channels
for the roots to grow,</font>

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.347
<font color="White">oxygen to flow.</font>

01:45:21.608 --> 01:45:23.739
<font color="White">And all the organisms,
things you can't see,</font>

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.173
<font color="White">all grow in that area too.</font>

01:45:28.565 --> 01:45:30.391
<font color="White">We don’t plow it,
we don’t disc it,</font>

01:45:30.652 --> 01:45:32.391
<font color="White">we don’t do anything.
We leave it</font>

01:45:32.652 --> 01:45:35.652
<font color="White">and it gets deeper and deeper.
It’s eaten by the organisms</font>

01:45:35.913 --> 01:45:39.000
<font color="White">and dissolves and turns back
into plant food.</font>

01:45:41.086 --> 01:45:42.086
<font color="White">We found when we plow</font>

01:45:42.347 --> 01:45:43.869
<font color="White">we actually get
an explosion of earthworms</font>

01:45:44.086 --> 01:45:47.086
<font color="White">if we’re plowing
in a good green cover crop.</font>

01:45:49.304 --> 01:45:50.869
<font color="White">You know, just because
when a conventional farmer</font>

01:45:51.086 --> 01:45:53.260
<font color="White">plows all the time and
he loses all his worms</font>

01:45:53.521 --> 01:45:55.521
<font color="White">doesn't mean
the plow is killing them.</font>

01:45:55.782 --> 01:45:57.956
<font color="White">From what I'm seeing,
I would believe that probably</font>

01:45:58.173 --> 01:45:59.826
<font color="White">it's the fact
that he's not putting</font>

01:46:00.043 --> 01:46:02.478
<font color="White">any food down for them
that's killing them.</font>

01:46:04.173 --> 01:46:06.956
<font color="White">So this piece of ground
has just recently been tilled,</font>

01:46:07.173 --> 01:46:08.782
<font color="White">and there's nothing
growing on it right now.</font>

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.304
<font color="White">So the main process going on
in the soil right now</font>

01:46:12.565 --> 01:46:14.434
<font color="White">would be
that decomposition process</font>

01:46:14.695 --> 01:46:17.695
<font color="White">so the breakdown
of organic compounds in the soil</font>

01:46:17.956 --> 01:46:19.173
<font color="White">and the release of nutrients.</font>

01:46:19.434 --> 01:46:21.391
<font color="White">And that's one of the reasons
why farmers,</font>

01:46:21.652 --> 01:46:24.000
<font color="White">for thousands of years,
have tilled the soil,</font>

01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:26.173
<font color="White">because it stimulates
decomposition.</font>

01:46:26.478 --> 01:46:30.565
<font color="White">And because the tillage process
breaks up some soil aggregates</font>

01:46:30.826 --> 01:46:32.956
<font color="White">and makes carbon that
might have been protected</font>

01:46:33.173 --> 01:46:35.739
<font color="White">previously more available
for the organisms.</font>

01:46:37.565 --> 01:46:40.391
<font color="White">Carbon is actually
the key nutrient that drives</font>

01:46:40.652 --> 01:46:43.565
<font color="White">the life of organisms
in the soil.</font>

01:46:44.565 --> 01:46:46.434
<font color="White">Soil organisms
are desperate for carbon,</font>

01:46:46.695 --> 01:46:48.043
<font color="White">the more carbon
you add to the soil,</font>

01:46:48.304 --> 01:46:50.217
<font color="White">the more they like
to burn it up.</font>

01:46:58.043 --> 01:47:01.086
<font color="White">When you move
to an agricultural system,</font>

01:47:01.434 --> 01:47:03.478
<font color="White">you’re removing nutrients
from the soil</font>

01:47:03.739 --> 01:47:05.260
<font color="White">in the form
of those harvested plants.</font>

01:47:05.521 --> 01:47:07.826
<font color="White">Nutrients have to come back
into the soil</font>

01:47:08.043 --> 01:47:09.652
<font color="White">to replenish the soil.</font>

01:47:10.956 --> 01:47:13.521
<font color="White">The most important thing that
we could do right now is</font>

01:47:13.782 --> 01:47:16.043
<font color="White">to take seriously what
Sir Albert Howard called</font>

01:47:16.304 --> 01:47:17.217
<font color="White">the "law of return."</font>

01:47:17.521 --> 01:47:20.869
<font color="White">What he meant by that was
the best way</font>

01:47:21.086 --> 01:47:24.000
<font color="White">to enhance and retain</font>

01:47:24.217 --> 01:47:26.000
<font color="White">the living capacity of the soil</font>

01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:28.043
<font color="White">and its capacity
for self-renewal</font>

01:47:28.304 --> 01:47:30.913
<font color="White">is to return to the soil</font>

01:47:31.130 --> 01:47:33.521
<font color="White">all of those things
that we use...</font>

01:47:33.782 --> 01:47:35.652
<font color="White">that we get from the soil.</font>

01:47:50.565 --> 01:47:52.869
<font color="White">Now this is
how we make our compost.</font>

01:47:53.086 --> 01:47:55.217
<font color="White">We have all
the raw material here.</font>

01:47:55.478 --> 01:47:57.913
<font color="White">Basically we are creating
a body.</font>

01:47:58.260 --> 01:47:59.652
<font color="White">Straw is the carbon,</font>

01:47:59.913 --> 01:48:02.782
<font color="White">the 50% of the compost
is made of carbon.</font>

01:48:03.608 --> 01:48:05.739
<font color="White">The 25% we put in green matter.</font>

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.695
<font color="White">so we try to bring the nitrogen
by putting the green matter.</font>

01:48:12.304 --> 01:48:15.000
<font color="White">And 25%, we have the dung,</font>

01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:17.391
<font color="White">may it be the cow dung
or the buffalo dung.</font>

01:48:23.739 --> 01:48:28.000
<font color="White">On every layer we put
a biodynamic inoculation.</font>

01:48:29.043 --> 01:48:30.652
<font color="White">And this is the rock phosphate.</font>

01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:32.521
<font color="White">A pinch of lime</font>

01:48:32.782 --> 01:48:36.521
<font color="White">does not let the nitrogen
fly up as ammonia.</font>

01:48:37.391 --> 01:48:39.782
<font color="White">It’s an art of making compost.</font>

01:48:50.391 --> 01:48:54.000
<font color="White">That stuff, when it decomposes,
it becomes this...</font>

01:48:54.217 --> 01:48:56.913
<font color="White">it will take another 20 days
maybe,</font>

01:48:57.130 --> 01:48:59.304
<font color="White">it has been given two turnings
and you can look</font>

01:48:59.565 --> 01:49:01.782
<font color="White">at the rich compost</font>

01:49:02.521 --> 01:49:05.347
<font color="White">and it's all greasy.
Greasy means</font>

01:49:05.608 --> 01:49:07.739
<font color="White">these are the byproducts
of the microbes</font>

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.130
<font color="White">which have eaten away.</font>

01:49:09.391 --> 01:49:11.826
<font color="White">And the more greasy it is,
the better.</font>

01:49:12.043 --> 01:49:13.478
<font color="White">There's a lot of humus in it.</font>

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.391
<font color="White">And it smells like jungle soil.</font>

01:49:26.565 --> 01:49:29.347
<i><font color="White">[heavy machinery noise]</font>

01:49:37.652 --> 01:49:40.217
<font color="White">So what you're looking at here
is about a 20-acre site</font>

01:49:40.478 --> 01:49:43.000
<font color="White">in which we bring food scraps
and other materials</font>

01:49:43.217 --> 01:49:45.217
<font color="White">from San Francisco,
the whole Bay Area,</font>

01:49:45.478 --> 01:49:47.130
<font color="White">and we compost them
into a material</font>

01:49:47.391 --> 01:49:48.608
<font color="White">that can be used on farms.</font>

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.956
<font color="White">This is about one million pounds
of recycled organic food</font>

01:50:13.173 --> 01:50:15.521
<font color="White">and recycled organic
green waste.</font>

01:50:16.521 --> 01:50:20.000
<font color="White">Our soils are starving
for this organic matter.</font>

01:50:40.695 --> 01:50:42.956
<font color="White">I am the sheet mulch queen.</font>

01:50:43.434 --> 01:50:45.173
<font color="White">So we don't grow plants.</font>

01:50:45.434 --> 01:50:48.000
<font color="White">We grow soil,
and soil grows plants.</font>

01:50:48.695 --> 01:50:50.565
<font color="White">We actually built up
eight inches of topsoil</font>

01:50:50.826 --> 01:50:52.521
<font color="White">in about five years.</font>

01:50:52.782 --> 01:50:55.478
<font color="White">And now it's up
to 12 inches of topsoil.</font>

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.826
<font color="White">The organic matter level
in this soil</font>

01:50:59.043 --> 01:51:03.000
<font color="White">has increased dramatically
from about 4% or 5%</font>

01:51:03.565 --> 01:51:05.521
<font color="White">to over almost 18%.</font>

01:51:05.782 --> 01:51:08.391
<font color="White">And scientists
will tell you this doesn't work,</font>

01:51:08.652 --> 01:51:10.608
<font color="White">but it does and you can see it.</font>

01:51:10.913 --> 01:51:16.000
<font color="White">This soil just goes down and
down and down and down</font>

01:51:16.521 --> 01:51:17.521
<font color="White">deep, rich.</font>

01:51:17.782 --> 01:51:19.043
<font color="White">Now it didn't start off
like that.</font>

01:51:19.304 --> 01:51:20.913
<font color="White">If you can take with this soil,</font>

01:51:21.130 --> 01:51:24.869
<font color="White">which is about the poorest soil
in the British Isles,</font>

01:51:25.086 --> 01:51:28.391
<font color="White">and produce healthy
economic crops</font>

01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:31.086
<font color="White">year after year,
decade after decade,</font>

01:51:31.347 --> 01:51:34.434
<font color="White">with the soil improving
every year,</font>

01:51:34.826 --> 01:51:36.565
<font color="White">then I see no reason why</font>

01:51:36.826 --> 01:51:38.956
<font color="White">this can't happen anywhere.</font>

01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:42.391
<font color="White">Like many organic farmers,</font>

01:51:42.652 --> 01:51:46.086
<font color="White">we were also buying in
organically-approved inputs.</font>

01:51:46.347 --> 01:51:49.000
<font color="White">- Absolutely, yeah...
- Chicken manures,</font>

01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:51.173
<font color="White">rock phosphates, lime,</font>

01:51:51.434 --> 01:51:53.565
<font color="White">all the other things that many
organic farmers...</font>

01:51:53.826 --> 01:51:56.782
<font color="White">And that's stopped.
We don't do anything like that.</font>

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.478
<font color="White">But a lot of organic growers
still do this.</font>

01:51:59.739 --> 01:52:00.913
<font color="White">They have an organic version</font>

01:52:01.130 --> 01:52:02.869
<font color="White">of the conventional mode,
if you like.</font>

01:52:03.086 --> 01:52:07.304
<font color="White">But it's a shortcut to problems,</font>

01:52:07.565 --> 01:52:09.043
<font color="White">which we found to our cost.</font>

01:52:09.304 --> 01:52:11.130
<font color="White">And so we've now found
that the compost,</font>

01:52:11.391 --> 01:52:15.217
<font color="White">as well as helping the disease,
soil disease problems,</font>

01:52:15.478 --> 01:52:17.304
<font color="White">has its own nutrient value
anyway</font>

01:52:17.565 --> 01:52:19.869
<font color="White">and has reactivated
the soil biology.</font>

01:52:20.086 --> 01:52:23.304
<font color="White">And so now we're in this rather
happy situation of saving money,</font>

01:52:23.565 --> 01:52:25.695
<font color="White">because we only use compost,</font>

01:52:25.956 --> 01:52:28.000
<font color="White">and our only inputs are seeds</font>

01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:29.478
<font color="White">and compost.</font>

01:52:37.565 --> 01:52:39.782
<i><font color="White">[liquid gurgling]</font>

01:53:01.869 --> 01:53:05.304
<font color="White">Here we have a forced
aerobic compost tea brewer.</font>

01:53:06.391 --> 01:53:09.086
<font color="White">It’s mimicking
the motion of the creek.</font>

01:53:09.347 --> 01:53:13.043
<font color="White">And it’s loaded with
aerobic soil biology.</font>

01:53:14.739 --> 01:53:16.652
<i><font color="White">[gushing water]</font>

01:53:29.869 --> 01:53:32.739
<font color="White">So 70%
of our fresh water resources</font>

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.086
<font color="White">on this planet now are used just
for agricultural irrigation.</font>

01:53:36.347 --> 01:53:38.695
<font color="White">And we’re drawing down
our fresh water resources</font>

01:53:38.956 --> 01:53:42.347
<font color="White">all across the planet at an
absolutely unsustainable rate.</font>

01:53:43.086 --> 01:53:47.782
<font color="White">Now this well is at least
more than 150 years old.</font>

01:53:48.434 --> 01:53:51.000
<font color="White">And we had
a water level of 30 feet.</font>

01:53:51.434 --> 01:53:54.956
<font color="White">That was just 40 years back,
just 40 years back I'm saying.</font>

01:53:55.173 --> 01:53:57.086
<font color="White">Thirty feet. And now today,</font>

01:53:57.347 --> 01:53:59.304
<font color="White">the water level,
the ground water is 100 feet.</font>

01:53:59.565 --> 01:54:02.043
<font color="White">So there's a drop of 70 feet.</font>

01:54:02.478 --> 01:54:03.869
<font color="White">In China, for example,</font>

01:54:04.086 --> 01:54:07.956
<font color="White">where 80% of grain
is dependent on irrigation,</font>

01:54:08.304 --> 01:54:09.739
<font color="White">they’re drawing down
their ground water,</font>

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.826
<font color="White">some places already pumping
from 1,000 feet deep.</font>

01:54:13.043 --> 01:54:16.739
<font color="White">Here in the United States,
where the Ogallala Aquifer</font>

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.086
<font color="White">provides most of the irrigation
water for the heartland,</font>

01:54:20.347 --> 01:54:22.782
<font color="White">that’s been drawn down
by half since 1960.</font>

01:54:31.130 --> 01:54:33.565
<font color="White">In California a big impact,</font>

01:54:33.826 --> 01:54:35.086
<font color="White">particularly
in Southern California</font>

01:54:35.347 --> 01:54:39.347
<font color="White">but also in any arid region
of the world where we irrigate,</font>

01:54:39.608 --> 01:54:41.956
<font color="White">is salinization of the soil.</font>

01:54:42.173 --> 01:54:43.521
<font color="White">And applying a lot of water,</font>

01:54:43.782 --> 01:54:47.608
<font color="White">the water evaporates,
and leaves behind salts.</font>

01:54:49.434 --> 01:54:52.043
<font color="White">The loss
of productive agricultural soils</font>

01:54:52.304 --> 01:54:57.826
<font color="White">due to salinization equals that
now of losses due to erosion.</font>

01:54:58.043 --> 01:55:00.782
<font color="White">And so this is why
10 million hectares of land</font>

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.434
<font color="White">are being abandoned annually
in the world</font>

01:55:03.695 --> 01:55:06.695
<font color="White">because of salinization.</font>

01:55:08.956 --> 01:55:10.217
<font color="White">So we use dripper lines.</font>

01:55:10.478 --> 01:55:12.652
<font color="White">Dripper lines use
vastly less water</font>

01:55:12.913 --> 01:55:16.000
<font color="White">and less electricity to bring
water to your field crops.</font>

01:55:16.217 --> 01:55:19.739
<font color="White">We planted the lines of broccoli
down the outside.</font>

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.260
<font color="White">And we planted tatsoi,
a wonderful Asian green,</font>

01:55:22.521 --> 01:55:24.173
<font color="White">down the middle.</font>

01:55:24.434 --> 01:55:25.217
<font color="White">The benefit is,</font>

01:55:25.478 --> 01:55:28.217
<font color="White">if you are looking
at this bed from the top now,</font>

01:55:28.478 --> 01:55:29.478
<font color="White">you actually can’t see the soil,</font>

01:55:29.739 --> 01:55:31.826
<font color="White">which means the sun
isn’t reaching the soil.</font>

01:55:32.043 --> 01:55:35.086
<font color="White">So the soil is staying shaded,
it’s staying moist,</font>

01:55:35.347 --> 01:55:37.391
<font color="White">reducing the weed competition</font>

01:55:37.652 --> 01:55:39.391
<font color="White">and therefore
reducing our labor.</font>

01:55:39.652 --> 01:55:43.739
<font color="White">It also reduces evaporation,
so it means we can water less.</font>

01:55:45.695 --> 01:55:49.782
<font color="White">We make about 200 to 300 yards
of our own compost every year</font>

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.608
<font color="White">entirely from materials
here on the farm.</font>

01:55:52.086 --> 01:55:52.913
<font color="White">And that goes into our fields,</font>

01:55:53.130 --> 01:55:54.826
<font color="White">a couple of inches thick
in every bed row.</font>

01:55:55.043 --> 01:55:58.347
<font color="White">It helps maintain water
moisture in the soil.</font>

01:55:59.130 --> 01:56:00.826
<font color="White">We have friends and neighbors
who are irrigating</font>

01:56:01.043 --> 01:56:03.086
<font color="White">about 3 or 4 hours
of drip per day,</font>

01:56:03.347 --> 01:56:06.652
<font color="White">and we’re doing about 1 hour
of drip per week.</font>

01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:09.869
<font color="White">That’s the difference in terms
of feeding your soil.</font>

01:56:10.086 --> 01:56:13.478
<font color="White">That allows us to use a 10th
or a 20th of the water</font>

01:56:13.739 --> 01:56:14.565
<font color="White">that some of our neighbors
are using</font>

01:56:14.826 --> 01:56:16.565
<font color="White">in this exact same environment
here in California,</font>

01:56:16.826 --> 01:56:19.652
<font color="White">where we have a dry season,
a long dry season.</font>

01:56:24.347 --> 01:56:26.304
<font color="White">Here what we see is soil</font>

01:56:26.565 --> 01:56:29.869
<font color="White">from the Rodale Institute
Farming Systems Trial.</font>

01:56:30.086 --> 01:56:32.478
<font color="White">We have 300 milliliters of water</font>

01:56:32.739 --> 01:56:36.173
<font color="White">that is gonna be introduced
to 1000 grams of soil.</font>

01:56:36.434 --> 01:56:38.826
<font color="White">Here is the simulated rainfall.</font>

01:56:39.130 --> 01:56:42.000
<font color="White">Did you see that we’re having
runoff now?</font>

01:56:43.478 --> 01:56:46.130
<font color="White">And this runoff is actually</font>

01:56:46.391 --> 01:56:49.391
<font color="White">showing the erosion
of the soil particles.</font>

01:56:50.782 --> 01:56:52.217
<font color="White">And we're gonna see
somewhat different effect</font>

01:56:52.478 --> 01:56:54.043
<font color="White">when we have organic soil,</font>

01:56:54.304 --> 01:56:57.173
<font color="White">related to
the increased organic matter.</font>

01:56:58.521 --> 01:57:02.521
<font color="White">You see that there is
some runoff occurring,</font>

01:57:02.782 --> 01:57:04.869
<font color="White">but the runoff is much clearer,</font>

01:57:05.086 --> 01:57:10.000
<font color="White">and there's more water that
is being absorbed into the soil.</font>

01:57:15.086 --> 01:57:18.000
<font color="White">When you add compost
to the organic soil,</font>

01:57:18.217 --> 01:57:20.739
<font color="White">the loss is less than a hundred.</font>

01:57:22.826 --> 01:57:27.304
<font color="White">When we have the mulch and
the organic system and compost,</font>

01:57:27.565 --> 01:57:32.043
<font color="White">there’s more water that
is being absorbed into the soil.</font>

01:57:34.565 --> 01:57:37.434
<font color="White">Now you see how clear
the water is here.</font>

01:57:38.217 --> 01:57:42.086
<font color="White">As we improve the soil,
we get much less runoff.</font>

01:57:42.565 --> 01:57:46.347
<font color="White">One of the ways of avoiding
catastrophic floods</font>

01:57:46.608 --> 01:57:49.000
<font color="White">is by improving our soil.</font>

01:57:50.347 --> 01:57:53.000
<font color="White">Now we're gonna
take these beakers out,</font>

01:57:53.391 --> 01:57:56.956
<font color="White">and we're gonna show you what's
happening below the surface.</font>

01:57:57.260 --> 01:57:59.217
<font color="White">If we look at the bottom of
our containers,</font>

01:57:59.478 --> 01:58:02.130
<font color="White">we see that actually
there's no water</font>

01:58:02.565 --> 01:58:04.782
<font color="White">that runs through
the conventional soil.</font>

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.695
<font color="White">So that you're not getting
anything that could be supplying</font>

01:58:08.956 --> 01:58:12.043
<font color="White">the aquifers, the water storage
that is underground,</font>

01:58:12.304 --> 01:58:16.086
<font color="White">or the surface rivers because
of the poor nature of the soil.</font>

01:58:17.521 --> 01:58:20.391
<font color="White">But as we use
these organic soil methods</font>

01:58:20.652 --> 01:58:22.000
<font color="White">and we create an organic soil,</font>

01:58:22.217 --> 01:58:23.521
<font color="White">what we see is
that we're getting</font>

01:58:23.782 --> 01:58:27.000
<font color="White">not only less water loss
on the surface,</font>

01:58:27.304 --> 01:58:30.043
<font color="White">but we're getting water charge
in the subsurface</font>

01:58:30.304 --> 01:58:34.086
<font color="White">which is feeding our aquifers
and our surface streams.</font>

01:58:35.826 --> 01:58:37.869
<font color="White">So this is very good for
our natural resources</font>

01:58:38.086 --> 01:58:42.086
<font color="White">and most of our water comes from
underground water sources.</font>

01:58:42.347 --> 01:58:43.913
<font color="White">So we've watched here
at the Rodale Institute</font>

01:58:44.130 --> 01:58:46.260
<font color="White">over the years is when
we have drought years,</font>

01:58:46.521 --> 01:58:47.608
<font color="White">our organic fields</font>

01:58:47.869 --> 01:58:51.956
<font color="White">can produce 30% to 70%
more corn or more soybeans,</font>

01:58:52.173 --> 01:58:54.434
<font color="White">because there's
the organic matter in that soil,</font>

01:58:54.695 --> 01:58:58.043
<font color="White">than a conventional chemical
synthetic-based farm ever could.</font>

01:58:58.304 --> 01:58:59.217
<font color="White">So when they talk about</font>

01:58:59.478 --> 01:59:02.217
<font color="White">what we need is bio-engineered
plants for drought resistance,</font>

01:59:02.478 --> 01:59:04.782
<font color="White">we're kind of slapping
our foreheads and going, "What?</font>

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:08.565
<font color="White">"What we need is healthy soil
with organic matter in it."</font>

01:59:08.826 --> 01:59:12.000
<font color="White">And you don't have to put a bio-
engineered gene into that plant.</font>

01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:15.130
<font color="White">You can out-produce conventional
by a whole bunch</font>

01:59:15.391 --> 01:59:17.434
<font color="White">by just improving that soil.</font>

01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:25.173
<font color="White">Here we have a new technique
called "organic no-till,"</font>

01:59:25.695 --> 01:59:28.956
<font color="White">and you can see
that the soil is covered</font>

01:59:29.173 --> 01:59:31.913
<font color="White">with a cover crop
that is rolled down.</font>

01:59:35.826 --> 01:59:38.956
<font color="White">When we put a mat on it,
the materials that are in it</font>

01:59:39.173 --> 01:59:42.739
<font color="White">are high in the nitrogen that is
needed for the corn plant.</font>

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.086
<font color="White">We get both the fertility</font>

01:59:45.347 --> 01:59:47.739
<font color="White">and the better
resource conservation.</font>

01:59:52.043 --> 01:59:54.652
<font color="White">In my gardens, I grow
two things all the time:</font>

01:59:55.086 --> 01:59:58.869
<font color="White">50% for people, which
is the potato in this case,</font>

01:59:59.521 --> 02:00:01.652
<font color="White">and 50% of the land for nature,</font>

02:00:01.913 --> 02:00:04.086
<font color="White">the soil improvement
cycling crops.</font>

02:00:04.347 --> 02:00:05.086
<font color="White">It's very important.</font>

02:00:05.347 --> 02:00:07.869
<font color="White">Without a balance
between the two,</font>

02:00:08.826 --> 02:00:10.260
<font color="White">things will collapse.</font>

02:00:10.782 --> 02:00:14.130
<font color="White">In my gardens and in the gardens
of the future, I believe,</font>

02:00:14.391 --> 02:00:18.478
<font color="White">we need to recognize and feed
nature as we feed humanity.</font>

02:00:18.739 --> 02:00:23.130
<font color="White">And so I grow this crop of
mixed soil-improvement plants.</font>

02:00:23.391 --> 02:00:25.782
<font color="White">You can call them weeds
they're mustards and vetches</font>

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.217
<font color="White">and clovers and a wide range
of different plants in here,</font>

02:00:29.478 --> 02:00:31.913
<font color="White">and as well as potatoes.
There are no bugs,</font>

02:00:32.130 --> 02:00:34.478
<font color="White">there are no disorders of
any kind out here,</font>

02:00:34.739 --> 02:00:36.347
<font color="White">it all transpires.</font>

02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:40.130
<font color="White">And the potato plant
has not yet come to bloom,</font>

02:00:40.391 --> 02:00:43.565
<font color="White">and it's an immature potato
plant at this time of year.</font>

02:00:43.826 --> 02:00:47.782
<font color="White">But we'll harvest one just to
examine what it looks like.</font>

02:00:48.608 --> 02:00:52.304
<font color="White">We see large masses
of fibrous root systems,</font>

02:00:52.565 --> 02:00:56.000
<font color="White">and we see nice soft
crumbly soils</font>

02:00:56.260 --> 02:01:00.608
<font color="White">that have good aggregation
to them held together</font>

02:01:00.869 --> 02:01:03.130
<font color="White">by yeasts and molds
and bacterial colonies</font>

02:01:03.391 --> 02:01:06.000
<font color="White">filled with fibrous,
small root systems.</font>

02:01:06.217 --> 02:01:08.043
<font color="White">And there's the mother potato,</font>

02:01:08.304 --> 02:01:10.173
<font color="White">and it's just beginning
to fruit,</font>

02:01:10.434 --> 02:01:12.521
<font color="White">and it has a few small
new potatoes.</font>

02:01:13.695 --> 02:01:16.956
<font color="White">And it weighed about
two-and-a-half or three ounces</font>

02:01:17.173 --> 02:01:18.608
<font color="White">and it's still solid.</font>

02:01:18.869 --> 02:01:21.826
<font color="White">It has yet to be drained,
it's just barely begun.</font>

02:01:22.173 --> 02:01:23.695
<font color="White">Generally
under this circumstance,</font>

02:01:23.956 --> 02:01:25.347
<font color="White">I will plant one potato,</font>

02:01:25.608 --> 02:01:27.478
<font color="White">in this garden,
under the way I garden,</font>

02:01:27.739 --> 02:01:31.478
<font color="White">I'll plant one potato and I will
get 14 equal-sized potatoes.</font>

02:01:32.565 --> 02:01:35.391
<font color="White">This is also part of nature.</font>

02:01:35.652 --> 02:01:37.304
<font color="White">Humanly trained, I'm afraid.</font>

02:01:37.565 --> 02:01:40.304
<font color="White">Well, that's the end
of the potato story.</font>

<i><font color="White">[woman's laughter]</font>

02:01:50.130 --> 02:01:54.260
<font color="White">In the US, there's
a hundred million head of cattle</font>

02:01:54.521 --> 02:01:56.000
<font color="White">that are grazing the land,</font>

02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:59.086
<font color="White">seven million sheep,
and four million horses.</font>

02:01:59.347 --> 02:02:02.086
<font color="White">And the US Department
of Agriculture reports that</font>

02:02:02.347 --> 02:02:05.826
<font color="White">we have a serious
overgrazing problem.</font>

02:02:06.043 --> 02:02:09.043
<font color="White">And of course that contributes
to increased soil erosion.</font>

02:02:09.304 --> 02:02:12.173
<font color="White">Not as bad as Africa,
where they've almost totally</font>

02:02:12.434 --> 02:02:14.956
<font color="White">stripped all the grass
off the land.</font>

02:02:17.347 --> 02:02:18.826
<font color="White">About five years ago,
we certified</font>

02:02:19.043 --> 02:02:21.086
<font color="White">our cattle as organic.</font>

02:02:21.608 --> 02:02:24.826
<font color="White">And in doing so, we stopped
any inputs to the soil</font>

02:02:25.043 --> 02:02:26.043
<font color="White">and plants,</font>

02:02:26.304 --> 02:02:28.608
<font color="White">but we also stopped using
parasiticides</font>

02:02:28.869 --> 02:02:30.000
<font color="White">or any antibiotics.</font>

02:02:31.130 --> 02:02:34.782
<font color="White">And we were walking around,
and I remember 2 or 3 years ago,</font>

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.478
<font color="White">we looked at some cow patties.</font>

02:02:37.782 --> 02:02:39.913
<font color="White">And we noticed some holes
in the cow patties.</font>

02:02:40.130 --> 02:02:42.000
<font color="White">And I remember talking
to my sister, Ginnie,</font>

02:02:42.217 --> 02:02:44.173
<font color="White">saying, "Do you remember</font>

02:02:44.434 --> 02:02:47.043
<font color="White">"when we were growing up,
we'd see cow patties</font>

02:02:47.304 --> 02:02:50.043
<font color="White">"filled with holes, then
the cow patty would disappear?"</font>

02:02:50.304 --> 02:02:51.043
<font color="White">"They're back!</font>

02:02:51.304 --> 02:02:53.652
<font color="White">"Whatever's doing that,
it's doing it again."</font>

02:02:53.913 --> 02:02:57.608
<font color="White">The parasiticides that
we give to the cows</font>

02:02:57.869 --> 02:03:00.565
<font color="White">come out very concentrated
in their manure.</font>

02:03:00.826 --> 02:03:02.478
<font color="White">It ended up killing</font>

02:03:02.739 --> 02:03:05.304
<font color="White">the natural dung beetle
that was here.</font>

02:03:05.739 --> 02:03:08.913
<font color="White">And it didn't kill them all,
they just started to recover</font>

02:03:09.130 --> 02:03:11.608
<font color="White">when we stopped using
those parasiticides.</font>

02:03:11.869 --> 02:03:13.695
<font color="White">The dung beetles take
little packets</font>

02:03:13.956 --> 02:03:14.695
<font color="White">and they make little balls</font>

02:03:14.956 --> 02:03:18.434
<font color="White">that they carry up to four feet
away from that dung pile...</font>

02:03:19.521 --> 02:03:21.739
<font color="White">So what you're actually doing is
spreading the fertility around,</font>

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.521
<font color="White">aerating the soil,
and they're doing their job.</font>

02:03:24.826 --> 02:03:27.608
<font color="White">Because the cow patty,
if we don't have the dung beetle</font>

02:03:27.869 --> 02:03:31.826
<font color="White">and they don't move, you end up
with a burned hole in the grass</font>

02:03:32.043 --> 02:03:35.652
<font color="White">from the high nitrogen content
of the manure and the shading.</font>

02:03:35.913 --> 02:03:38.260
<font color="White">And as it decomposes, that's
where the increasers come.</font>

02:03:38.521 --> 02:03:40.347
<font color="White">That's where we end up
having thistles</font>

02:03:40.608 --> 02:03:41.956
<font color="White">and weed problems.</font>

02:03:42.173 --> 02:03:44.043
<font color="White">So truth be known,</font>

02:03:44.304 --> 02:03:46.956
<font color="White">we've actually had
a reduction in weed problems</font>

02:03:47.173 --> 02:03:48.608
<font color="White">after certifying organic.</font>

02:03:48.869 --> 02:03:51.391
<font color="White">We've also had
an increase in productivity.</font>

02:03:51.652 --> 02:03:53.434
<font color="White">Because the soils are healthier,</font>

02:03:53.695 --> 02:03:55.521
<font color="White">the microbes
and the critters in the soil</font>

02:03:55.782 --> 02:03:57.217
<font color="White">are coming back to life.</font>

02:03:57.478 --> 02:03:58.956

an important part of our diet,</font>

In traditional agriculture,</font>

02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:49.826
<font color="White">animals were
an integral part of the farm</font>

02:04:50.043 --> 02:04:52.739
<font color="White">because they returned nutrients,

<font color="White">we created two problems.</font>

02:05:08.565 --> 02:05:10.260
<font color="White">Large accumulations of manure,</font>

02:05:10.521 --> 02:05:13.956
<font color="White">which means a lot of nitrogen
in the wrong place,</font>

02:05:20.869 --> 02:05:23.434
<font color="White">and soils that were depleted
of their nutrients</font>

02:05:23.695 --> 02:05:26.217
<font color="White">so that we now have farmers
who are dependent</font>

02:05:26.478 --> 02:05:28.260
<font color="White">on synthetic fertilizer.</font>

02:05:30.086 --> 02:05:32.434
<font color="White">About half of the fertilizer
that we add,</font>

02:05:32.695 --> 02:05:34.173
<font color="White">half of the nitrogen fertilizer</font>

02:05:34.434 --> 02:05:35.913
<font color="White">is lost from the system
right away,</font>

02:05:36.130 --> 02:05:38.782
<font color="White">and about half is taken up
by the crop.</font>

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.347
<font color="White">And that's the average.
It can be much higher.</font>

02:05:41.608 --> 02:05:42.521
<font color="White">In vegetable systems,</font>

02:05:42.782 --> 02:05:45.130
<font color="White">you can end up losing
80% of the nitrogen.</font>

Small amounts of nitrogen</font>

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.956
<font color="White">are continuously brought
into an ecosystem</font>

02:05:51.173 --> 02:05:52.043
<font color="White">by bacteria,</font>

02:05:52.304 --> 02:05:57.000
<font color="White">which fix the nitrogen from the
air into a plant-available form.</font>

02:06:03.304 --> 02:06:05.217
<font color="White">leguminous cover crops
and manure</font>

02:06:05.478 --> 02:06:07.478
<font color="White">add nitrogen to the soil.</font>

02:06:08.608 --> 02:06:10.304
<font color="White">There is minimum
leakage of nitrogen</font>

02:06:10.565 --> 02:06:12.695
<font color="White">in these organic farming
ecosystems</font>

02:06:12.956 --> 02:06:15.478
<font color="White">because the nitrogen
is released slowly,</font>

02:06:15.739 --> 02:06:19.173
<font color="White">and most of it is taken up
again by living organisms.</font>

02:06:22.130 --> 02:06:24.086
<font color="White">When synthetic
nitrogen fertilizer</font>

02:06:24.347 --> 02:06:26.478
<font color="White">is introduced into the field,</font>

02:06:26.869 --> 02:06:29.260
<font color="White">plants can use it
to produce more biomass,</font>

02:06:29.521 --> 02:06:32.956
<font color="White">and for a farmer,
this represents higher yield.</font>

02:06:33.521 --> 02:06:35.434
<font color="White">But plants can only use
a limited amount</font>

02:06:35.695 --> 02:06:37.826
<font color="White">of that nitrogen fertilizer,</font>

02:06:38.130 --> 02:06:41.260
<font color="White">so some farmers use more
and more fertilizer</font>

02:06:41.521 --> 02:06:44.826
<font color="White">to get smaller and smaller
increases in yield.</font>

02:06:45.869 --> 02:06:48.521
<font color="White">Excess nitrogen is released
into the ecosystem</font>

02:06:48.782 --> 02:06:51.217
<font color="White">and forms of this nitrogen
go into the air</font>

02:06:51.478 --> 02:06:53.739
<font color="White">as potent green house gases.</font>

02:06:54.434 --> 02:06:56.913
<font color="White">Fertilizing nitrogen
also leaks into the soil</font>

02:06:57.130 --> 02:07:00.391
<font color="White">and into the water system,
creating a range of problems,</font>

02:07:00.826 --> 02:07:02.652
<font color="White">from nitrates in drinking water</font>

02:07:02.913 --> 02:07:04.695
<font color="White">to the eutrophication
of water ways</font>

02:07:04.956 --> 02:07:08.086
<font color="White">and ultimately,
dead zones in the ocean.</font>

02:07:13.782 --> 02:07:17.347
<font color="White">You end up with a lot of
extra nutrients in those waters,</font>

02:07:17.608 --> 02:07:21.000
<font color="White">and that causes algae to bloom,
the plankton take off.</font>

02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:23.739
<font color="White">Then they die,
they sink down to the bottom.</font>

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.652
<font color="White">And while they're decomposing,
the oxygen demand goes up.</font>

02:07:27.913 --> 02:07:30.652
<font color="White">So all of a sudden,
where there was oxygen</font>

02:07:30.913 --> 02:07:34.086
<font color="White">to support fish, shrimp,
and other shellfish,</font>

02:07:34.347 --> 02:07:36.043
<font color="White">there isn't any,
so they all die.</font>

02:07:36.304 --> 02:07:40.826
<font color="White">Then you've got even more dead
organic biomass to decompose.</font>

02:07:42.260 --> 02:07:44.086
<font color="White">In the Gulf dead zone,</font>

02:07:44.347 --> 02:07:46.739
<font color="White">the average size for the last
few years has been about</font>

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
<font color="White">7,000 square miles.</font>

02:07:49.217 --> 02:07:51.086
<font color="White">About the size
of the state of New Jersey.</font>

02:08:09.173 --> 02:08:12.130
<font color="White">There is one dead zone,
the one in the Black Sea,</font>

02:08:12.391 --> 02:08:14.260
<font color="White">which was the largest dead zone
in the world,</font>

02:08:14.521 --> 02:08:16.217
<font color="White">that disappeared
for about ten years,</font>

02:08:16.478 --> 02:08:19.086
<font color="White">because,
when the Soviet Union collapsed,</font>

02:08:19.347 --> 02:08:21.304
<font color="White">they could no longer
afford fertilizers.</font>

02:08:21.565 --> 02:08:23.826
<font color="White">So that's promising. It means
we can do something about it</font>

02:08:24.043 --> 02:08:26.173
<font color="White">if we change our practices.</font>

02:08:26.608 --> 02:08:28.173
<font color="White">The strategy
that we need to use</font>

02:08:28.434 --> 02:08:29.913
<font color="White">is to look at improving
our field efficiency,</font>

02:08:30.130 --> 02:08:32.391
<font color="White">and this has implication
for greenhouse gases,</font>

02:08:32.652 --> 02:08:34.217
<font color="White">including carbon dioxide
production.</font>

02:08:34.478 --> 02:08:37.086
<font color="White">Because this synthetic nitrogen
that we're using</font>

02:08:37.347 --> 02:08:40.695
<font color="White">is extremely costly
in terms of energy,</font>

02:08:41.086 --> 02:08:43.782
<font color="White">which means it produces
a lot of carbon dioxide.</font>

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:48.478
<font color="White">This accounts for about 50% of
the energy use in agriculture.</font>

02:08:48.782 --> 02:08:52.695
<font color="White">So if we're continuing to just
use it at a 50% efficiency,</font>

02:08:52.956 --> 02:08:54.521
<font color="White">we have the environmental
consequences</font>

02:08:54.782 --> 02:08:57.434
<font color="White">of the leakiness
and also of the energy use</font>

02:08:57.695 --> 02:09:00.782
<font color="White">and all the pollution that
occurs from manufacturing it.</font>

02:09:09.304 --> 02:09:13.000
<font color="White">One strategy that has
a huge impact is to just</font>

02:09:13.217 --> 02:09:15.913
<font color="White">modify rotation so that
you have cover crops</font>

02:09:16.130 --> 02:09:18.000
<font color="White">alternating with the cash crops.</font>

02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:21.000
<font color="White">And we conducted a study
of all the research</font>

02:09:21.217 --> 02:09:22.478
<font color="White">that's been done
looking at cover crops,</font>

02:09:22.739 --> 02:09:24.826
<font color="White">and we found that,
on the average, if you</font>

02:09:25.043 --> 02:09:28.000
<font color="White">introduce cover crops
into an annual rotation</font>

02:09:28.217 --> 02:09:29.478
<font color="White">like corn and soybeans,</font>

02:09:29.739 --> 02:09:32.956
<font color="White">you reduce nitrate
leaching by 70%.</font>

02:09:33.565 --> 02:09:35.086
<font color="White">So that's a huge reduction.</font>

02:09:38.347 --> 02:09:42.434
<font color="White">A healthy soil is a fundamental
part of a healthy grapevine.</font>

02:09:42.695 --> 02:09:44.826
<font color="White">Of course the fundamental
of healthy soil</font>

02:09:45.043 --> 02:09:46.782
<font color="White">is adding organic matter
to the soil.</font>

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
<font color="White">So if we came out here
in February or March,</font>

02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:50.521
<font color="White">we’d be up to our chest</font>

02:09:50.782 --> 02:09:52.739
<font color="White">in peas, oats, vetches,
cover crops that</font>

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.782
<font color="White">we’ve grown to add
organic matter back to the soil,</font>

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.347
<font color="White">along with the compost that
we make from our grape pumice.</font>

02:10:03.565 --> 02:10:05.652
<font color="White">And here’s a nice earthworm, and</font>

02:10:05.913 --> 02:10:08.956
<font color="White">we can just see this is
like chocolate cake basically.</font>

02:10:09.173 --> 02:10:11.260
<font color="White">And this just smells so good!</font>

02:10:11.521 --> 02:10:15.130
<font color="White">This is gonna provide all that
this grapevine needs now</font>

02:10:15.391 --> 02:10:18.260
<font color="White">to provide great grapes
with deep flavor.</font>

02:10:20.826 --> 02:10:21.956
<font color="White">We came out here</font>

02:10:22.173 --> 02:10:24.347
<font color="White">and into another vineyard
in the Napa Valley, but there’s</font>

02:10:24.608 --> 02:10:27.130
<font color="White">really something fundamentally
different about this vineyard,</font>

02:10:27.391 --> 02:10:29.956
<font color="White">is that the soil itself</font>

02:10:30.391 --> 02:10:34.086
<font color="White">really doesn’t have a lot
to contribute to this grapevine</font>

02:10:34.347 --> 02:10:36.956
<font color="White">or to these eventual grapes.</font>

02:10:37.434 --> 02:10:38.086
<font color="White">And the reason is</font>

02:10:38.347 --> 02:10:41.086
<font color="White">that they’ve not added
organic matter back to the soil,</font>

02:10:41.347 --> 02:10:45.695
<font color="White">and therefore, as you can see,
it's become hard and compacted,</font>

02:10:45.956 --> 02:10:48.434
<font color="White">so it’s really become dirt,
not soil.</font>

02:10:51.956 --> 02:10:54.913
<font color="White">We started this farm
back in 1974.</font>

02:10:55.913 --> 02:10:58.000
<font color="White">One of the things
they told us was that</font>

02:10:58.217 --> 02:11:02.130
<font color="White">we wouldn’t really be able to
farm organically in California</font>

02:11:02.391 --> 02:11:04.086
<font color="White">because California</font>

02:11:04.347 --> 02:11:07.130
<font color="White">is an arid climate.
I mean, even here on the coast,</font>

02:11:07.391 --> 02:11:10.608
<font color="White">we have a lot of rain,
30 inches of rain annually.</font>

02:11:10.869 --> 02:11:14.521
<font color="White">But it all occurs in a matter
of four months.</font>

02:11:14.956 --> 02:11:19.304
<font color="White">So we have a long period
of arid conditions.</font>

02:11:19.565 --> 02:11:22.304
<font color="White">And we were told that</font>

02:11:22.565 --> 02:11:24.913
<font color="White">probably you weren't gonna
be able to farm organically</font>

02:11:25.130 --> 02:11:27.086
<font color="White">in any commercially
successful way</font>

02:11:27.347 --> 02:11:31.130
<font color="White">because you couldn't get
the humus levels high enough</font>

02:11:31.391 --> 02:11:35.782
<font color="White">to have the bacteria in
the soil hold the nitrogen</font>

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:40.391
<font color="White">and the fertility elements that
it needed for the crops.</font>

02:11:42.869 --> 02:11:44.391
<font color="White">It hasn't been difficult.</font>

02:11:44.652 --> 02:11:48.565
<font color="White">In the early years, we would do
really what we're doing now.</font>

02:11:49.086 --> 02:11:52.565
<font color="White">In the fall,
we plant cover crops.</font>

02:11:52.826 --> 02:11:53.565
<font color="White">In the spring,</font>

02:11:53.826 --> 02:11:56.130
<font color="White">we plow those down and
then start planting</font>

02:11:56.391 --> 02:11:58.000
<font color="White">and put out compost.</font>

02:11:58.347 --> 02:12:00.260
<font color="White">In fact, we’re farming
organically</font>

02:12:00.521 --> 02:12:01.956
<font color="White">all over the state now.</font>

02:12:03.173 --> 02:12:05.347
<font color="White">This farm is the oldest</font>

02:12:05.608 --> 02:12:07.913
<font color="White">certified organic farm
in California.</font>

02:12:15.826 --> 02:12:18.869
<font color="White">Once we changed
and we started to compost</font>

02:12:19.086 --> 02:12:21.304
<font color="White">our livestock manure
and put that back on the soil,</font>

02:12:21.565 --> 02:12:24.434
<font color="White">we used green-manure cover crops
and incorporated</font>

02:12:24.695 --> 02:12:28.043
<font color="White">that biomass back into the soil.
Within three years,</font>

02:12:28.304 --> 02:12:29.260
<font color="White">and even our neighbors,</font>

02:12:29.521 --> 02:12:31.043
<font color="White">who would walk
across the fields, saying,</font>

02:12:31.304 --> 02:12:34.217
<font color="White">"Your soil's so spongy,
now what did you do?"</font>

02:12:34.478 --> 02:12:36.260
<font color="White">And it was that living,</font>

02:12:36.521 --> 02:12:38.913
<font color="White">that return of the life
of the soil.</font>

02:12:39.130 --> 02:12:40.260
<font color="White">Within 2 to 3 years,</font>

02:12:40.521 --> 02:12:43.086
<font color="White">you can make a tremendous
difference in soil,</font>

02:12:43.347 --> 02:12:45.434
<font color="White">honoring that law of return.</font>

02:12:52.217 --> 02:12:53.434
<font color="White">For 28 years,</font>

02:12:53.782 --> 02:12:57.347
<font color="White">this area has received
conventional agriculture.</font>

02:12:57.739 --> 02:12:59.913
<font color="White">And one of the things that
you'll see here</font>

02:13:00.130 --> 02:13:03.782
<font color="White">is that the corn
is actually spindly</font>

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.434
<font color="White">and yellow,
and this is related to...</font>

02:13:06.913 --> 02:13:10.260
<font color="White">the soil has not improved
during the experiment.</font>

02:13:12.173 --> 02:13:15.913
<font color="White">This comes from long-term
organic management.</font>

02:13:16.478 --> 02:13:18.434
<font color="White">One of the things is that
people would freak out</font>

02:13:18.695 --> 02:13:20.391
<font color="White">with these weeds because</font>

02:13:20.652 --> 02:13:23.652
<font color="White">they would say that they're
taking away from the crop.</font>

02:13:23.913 --> 02:13:27.000
<font color="White">But our long-term data shows
that we can produce even more</font>

02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:30.347
<font color="White">in these organic systems than
in the conventional systems.</font>

02:13:30.608 --> 02:13:32.739
<font color="White">So that a lot of this
has to do with</font>

destroy mycorrhizae in the soil,</font>

02:14:01.260 --> 02:14:05.347
<font color="White">they can actually decrease
levels of beneficial</font>

<font color="White">They’re designed
to be used with RoundUp.</font>

02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:25.913
<font color="White">So, where we've gone in</font>

02:14:26.130 --> 02:14:28.565
<font color="White">and destroyed
the biology in the soil,</font>

<font color="White">you end up getting
this whole food web.</font>

<font color="White">and benefit from each other?</font>

02:18:54.913 --> 02:18:58.000
<font color="White">And how can you then
in agriculture organize those</font>

02:18:58.217 --> 02:19:00.043
<font color="White">in a way that you get
those synergies,</font>

02:19:00.304 --> 02:19:02.739
<font color="White">those benefits
from the synergies?</font>

02:19:13.434 --> 02:19:15.869
<font color="White">One of the really exciting
things here is that</font>

02:19:16.086 --> 02:19:17.782
<font color="White">we have
this working relationship</font>

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.739
<font color="White">between the farmers and
the chefs in the restaurant.</font>

02:19:21.173 --> 02:19:22.695
<font color="White">Well, there’s something
really special</font>

02:19:22.956 --> 02:19:24.695
<font color="White">about working
with passionate chefs.</font>

02:19:24.956 --> 02:19:26.565
<font color="White">To get that good carrot,</font>

02:19:26.826 --> 02:19:30.000
<font color="White">you’ve got to have good ecology
behind the carrot.</font>

02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:31.086
<font color="White">It’s grown in the right soil,</font>

02:19:31.347 --> 02:19:32.608
<font color="White">it has the right amendments
in the soil,</font>

02:19:32.869 --> 02:19:34.434
<font color="White">it's picked at the right moment,
all these issues</font>

02:19:34.695 --> 02:19:38.130
<font color="White">that improve
your overall local ecology.</font>

02:19:38.391 --> 02:19:40.695
<font color="White">Generally if that carrot’s so
delicious, it’s locally grown.</font>

02:19:42.565 --> 02:19:46.695
<font color="White">Blue Hill Restaurant here is
well-recognized now,</font>

02:19:48.652 --> 02:19:49.565
<font color="White">but throughout the country,</font>

02:19:49.826 --> 02:19:51.782
<font color="White">and even to some extent
throughout the world,</font>

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:55.043
<font color="White">as that’s where you’re going to
have the best meal of your life.</font>

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
<font color="White">And as those meals go out,</font>

02:19:58.217 --> 02:20:01.869
<font color="White">I occasionally catch a taste and
just see the presentation,</font>

02:20:02.304 --> 02:20:04.217
<font color="White">what he’s trying to get across.</font>

02:20:04.478 --> 02:20:07.130
<font color="White">Which is really just trying to
get across this awareness</font>

02:20:07.391 --> 02:20:09.608
<font color="White">of relation to the food.</font>

02:20:09.869 --> 02:20:14.739
<font color="White">I think the answers are on these
little microbiological levels.</font>

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.391
<font color="White">Because it translates, for me,
going back to flavor.</font>

02:20:17.652 --> 02:20:18.913
<font color="White">And you cannot have good flavor</font>

02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:21.391
<font color="White">without that kind
of attention to detail,</font>

02:20:21.652 --> 02:20:24.391
<font color="White">and knowledge of the biology,
and knowledge of the chemistry,</font>

02:20:24.652 --> 02:20:27.652
<font color="White">knowledge of these interactions
that are going on</font>

02:20:27.913 --> 02:20:31.869
<font color="White">on a soil level that are
key to health and to flavor.</font>

02:20:32.956 --> 02:20:36.391
<font color="White">And that to me
is hugely inspiring.</font>

02:20:37.086 --> 02:20:40.000
<font color="White">The best economic returns
are from</font>

02:20:40.260 --> 02:20:42.173
<font color="White">the best vegetables and fruits</font>

02:20:42.434 --> 02:20:45.130
<font color="White">and even meats that
are grown in the right way.</font>

02:20:45.391 --> 02:20:48.217
<font color="White">So here we do not bring
any outside inputs</font>

02:20:48.478 --> 02:20:52.521
<font color="White">for either our livestock or
our horticulture operations.</font>

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:55.608
<font color="White">Everything that’s used here,</font>

02:20:55.869 --> 02:20:58.000
<font color="White">and all of the waste
that’s produced here,</font>

02:20:58.217 --> 02:21:00.826
<font color="White">gets composted and
put back into the system.</font>

02:21:01.043 --> 02:21:03.043
<font color="White">Just like the carrot is not
the carrot is not the carrot,</font>

02:21:03.304 --> 02:21:05.260
<font color="White">compost is not compost
is not compost.</font>

02:21:05.521 --> 02:21:08.000
<font color="White">I thought you make compost,
you make compost, right?</font>

02:21:08.217 --> 02:21:11.000
<font color="White">But there’s a recipe to that
as interesting and as profound</font>

02:21:11.260 --> 02:21:14.391
<font color="White">and as important as the recipes
that I’m making in the kitchen.</font>

02:21:14.695 --> 02:21:16.695
<font color="White">And if you have
the biology right,</font>

02:21:16.956 --> 02:21:20.608
<font color="White">you’re going to taste these
different levels of flavor.</font>

02:21:34.652 --> 02:21:37.000
<font color="White">The success that
we've had in our food system,</font>

02:21:37.217 --> 02:21:39.565
<font color="White">over the last, 70 years or so</font>

02:21:40.086 --> 02:21:43.521
<font color="White">has been due to a unique
convergence of circumstances.</font>

02:21:43.869 --> 02:21:46.739
<font color="White">One is this incredible supply
of cheap energy</font>

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:50.347
<font color="White">in the form of oil
and natural gas and coal.</font>

02:21:56.782 --> 02:21:58.217
<font color="White">We saw in the UK in the year 2000</font>

02:21:58.478 --> 02:22:00.130
<font color="White">when the lorry drivers
went on strike,</font>

02:22:00.391 --> 02:22:01.739
<font color="White">and there were no lorries moving</font>

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:03.826
<font color="White">and there was no fuel,
liquid fuels,</font>

02:22:04.086 --> 02:22:05.565
<font color="White">we came about a day
and a half away</font>

02:22:05.826 --> 02:22:08.086
<font color="White">from a major food crisis
in this country.</font>

02:22:08.347 --> 02:22:10.695
<font color="White">Because it became very clear
that we had no food resilience</font>

02:22:10.956 --> 02:22:11.782
<font color="White">to fall back on.</font>

02:22:15.739 --> 02:22:17.043
<font color="White">So the real question is:</font>

02:22:17.304 --> 02:22:19.695
<font color="White">What kind of food system
are we gonna transition to</font>

02:22:19.956 --> 02:22:22.826
<font color="White">when we no longer have
these cheap fossil fuels</font>

02:22:23.260 --> 02:22:25.608
<font color="White">that provide the fertilizer
and the equipment</font>

02:22:25.869 --> 02:22:27.000
<font color="White">and everything else that's made</font>

02:22:27.260 --> 02:22:30.608
<font color="White">these highly specialized
production systems possible?</font>

02:22:31.347 --> 02:22:33.173
<font color="White">People think, it's not
gonna be such a big problem</font>

02:22:33.434 --> 02:22:35.086
<font color="White">because
there's alternative energy.</font>

02:22:35.347 --> 02:22:37.217
<font color="White">So all we gotta do
is switch from</font>

02:22:37.478 --> 02:22:40.086
<font color="White">Mid East oil to
corn-based ethanol from Iowa,</font>

02:22:40.347 --> 02:22:42.347
<font color="White">and then, problem solved.</font>

02:22:43.130 --> 02:22:46.608
<font color="White">Biofuels in the United States
are being produced with corn.</font>

02:22:46.869 --> 02:22:49.782
<font color="White">99.9% are with corn.</font>

02:22:50.565 --> 02:22:52.130
<font color="White">Corn production in the US</font>

02:22:52.391 --> 02:22:53.565
<font color="White">causes more soil erosion</font>

02:22:53.826 --> 02:22:55.217
<font color="White">than any other crop
grown in the nation,</font>

02:22:55.478 --> 02:22:56.695
<font color="White">Number One.</font>

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:58.260
<font color="White">Number Two,</font>

02:22:58.739 --> 02:23:01.565
<font color="White">corn production uses
more nitrogen fertilizer</font>

02:23:01.826 --> 02:23:04.521
<font color="White">than any other crop
grown in the nation.</font>

02:23:04.913 --> 02:23:09.260
<font color="White">And the leakage of the nitrogen
goes down the Mississippi,</font>

02:23:09.521 --> 02:23:12.000
<font color="White">and the National Academy of
Sciences indicate</font>

02:23:12.260 --> 02:23:15.217
<font color="White">that corn production
is the prime cause</font>

02:23:15.478 --> 02:23:18.565
<font color="White">of the dead zone down
in the Gulf of Mexico.</font>

02:23:18.826 --> 02:23:22.782
<font color="White">Another, corn production uses
more insecticides,</font>

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:26.869
<font color="White">more herbicides than any
other crop grown in the nation.</font>

02:23:27.608 --> 02:23:31.826
<font color="White">Because it takes 40%
more fossil energy</font>

02:23:32.347 --> 02:23:35.000
<font color="White">to produce
that gallon of ethanol,</font>

02:23:35.391 --> 02:23:38.826
<font color="White">that means that
there's significant contribution</font>

02:23:39.043 --> 02:23:41.217
<font color="White">to the global warming
or carbon dioxide</font>

02:23:41.478 --> 02:23:44.347
<font color="White">because of the excess
fossil energy used.</font>

02:23:45.260 --> 02:23:46.869
<font color="White">Oh, I should mention the water:</font>

02:23:47.086 --> 02:23:50.347
<font color="White">It takes 1,700 gallons of water</font>

02:23:50.608 --> 02:23:53.391
<font color="White">to produce 1 gallon of ethanol.</font>

02:23:54.956 --> 02:23:57.086
<font color="White">A very inconvenient side effect
that could happen</font>

02:23:57.347 --> 02:24:00.565
<font color="White">from a very aggressive move
towards biofuels is that,</font>

02:24:00.826 --> 02:24:05.347
<font color="White">if we grow the crops that would
provide those fuels in ways</font>

02:24:05.608 --> 02:24:08.130
<font color="White">that are as erosive as
conventional agriculture</font>

02:24:08.391 --> 02:24:09.695
<font color="White">is now for growing corn, say,</font>

02:24:09.956 --> 02:24:12.608
<font color="White">we could be in a situation
where we're essentially trading</font>

02:24:12.869 --> 02:24:16.043
<font color="White">a system that mines oil
for a system that mines soil.</font>

02:24:16.782 --> 02:24:18.782
<font color="White">In which case,
we've just changed the timeframe</font>

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:22.173
<font color="White">over which we're going
to engineer disaster.</font>

02:24:24.521 --> 02:24:27.869
<font color="White">We didn't ask the question,
as we, use more land and</font>

02:24:28.086 --> 02:24:30.869
<font color="White">put pressure on more farmers
to produce more corn</font>

02:24:31.086 --> 02:24:33.173
<font color="White">to both provide for the feed</font>

02:24:33.434 --> 02:24:36.869
<font color="White">and for the fuel,
and on top of that, the exports,</font>

02:24:37.086 --> 02:24:39.260
<font color="White">where are we gonna get
the additional land from?</font>

02:24:39.521 --> 02:24:41.217
<font color="White">We sort of kidded ourselves
into believing that</font>

02:24:41.478 --> 02:24:43.521
<font color="White">we could just increase
the yields rapidly enough</font>

02:24:43.782 --> 02:24:45.086
<font color="White">so we don't have to worry
about more land,</font>

02:24:45.347 --> 02:24:47.434
<font color="White">and of course that
hasn't worked that way.</font>

02:24:51.043 --> 02:24:52.347
<font color="White">I think what happened
in science,</font>

02:24:52.608 --> 02:24:53.608
<font color="White">and I come from
a science background,</font>

02:24:53.869 --> 02:24:55.347
<font color="White">is we became too reductionistic</font>

02:24:55.608 --> 02:24:57.782
<font color="White">and we started to look at
things too narrowly.</font>

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.130
<font color="White">And what the healthy soil
conversation is about</font>

02:25:00.391 --> 02:25:02.086
<font color="White">is really about
the whole biological system.</font>

02:25:02.478 --> 02:25:05.304
<font color="White">And rarely do we investigate
things as a system.</font>

02:25:06.869 --> 02:25:10.521
<font color="White">In 1984 there was
a drought in the south,</font>

02:25:11.347 --> 02:25:13.521
<font color="White">and lots of animals were dying,</font>

02:25:13.782 --> 02:25:15.217
<font color="White">and there was migration.</font>

02:25:16.565 --> 02:25:18.565
<font color="White">So I studied the region,</font>

02:25:18.826 --> 02:25:21.086
<font color="White">and I found the rain
hadn't reduced.</font>

02:25:21.347 --> 02:25:23.956
<font color="White">So why was there a drought
when the rain was the same?</font>

02:25:24.173 --> 02:25:27.913
<font color="White">And it turned out that
new seeds had been brought</font>

02:25:28.260 --> 02:25:31.086
<font color="White">that reduced the plant height,</font>

02:25:31.347 --> 02:25:33.043
<font color="White">got rid of the straw.</font>

02:25:33.826 --> 02:25:35.956
<font color="White">There was no straw for the soil,</font>

02:25:36.173 --> 02:25:39.391
<font color="White">there was no straw
for the fodder for animals.</font>

02:25:39.652 --> 02:25:41.739
<font color="White">So your rainfall was the same,</font>

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.391
<font color="White">but you had a soil drought</font>

02:25:44.652 --> 02:25:46.782
<font color="White">because your organic matter
had not returned.</font>

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
<font color="White">You had a fodder drought</font>

02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:51.434
<font color="White">because you had now redesigned,</font>

02:25:51.695 --> 02:25:53.000
<font color="White">in this case the sorghum,</font>

02:25:53.347 --> 02:25:56.000
<font color="White">to produce more grain
for the market</font>

02:25:56.608 --> 02:25:59.043
<font color="White">at the cost of less
organic matter</font>

02:25:59.304 --> 02:26:00.913
<font color="White">for the soil and for animals.</font>

02:26:12.304 --> 02:26:15.043
<font color="White">60% of our ecological systems</font>

02:26:15.304 --> 02:26:17.347
<font color="White">are now reaching
the point of collapse.</font>

02:26:17.608 --> 02:26:19.000
<font color="White">If that were to happen,</font>

02:26:19.217 --> 02:26:20.565
<font color="White">then it will fundamentally
change</font>

02:26:20.826 --> 02:26:22.782
<font color="White">the functioning of the planet.</font>

02:26:23.739 --> 02:26:25.782
<font color="White">Now I don't know if everybody
grasps the meaning of</font>

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.130
<font color="White">"fundamentally changing
the functions of the planet,"</font>

02:26:28.391 --> 02:26:30.304
<font color="White">but that really means that</font>

02:26:30.565 --> 02:26:33.521
<font color="White">the planet could evolve
into a kind of climate</font>

02:26:33.782 --> 02:26:37.434
<font color="White">that's not very good
for us as a human species.</font>

02:26:40.913 --> 02:26:43.434
<font color="White">How do we continue
to produce</font>

02:26:43.695 --> 02:26:44.956
<font color="White">an adequate amount of food</font>

02:26:45.173 --> 02:26:48.000
<font color="White">for a population
of 6.5 billion people</font>

02:26:48.217 --> 02:26:49.739
<font color="White">and getting larger?</font>

02:26:50.173 --> 02:26:52.391
<font color="White">We have increasing energy costs,</font>

02:26:53.739 --> 02:26:55.565
<font color="White">depleting water resources,</font>

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.478
<font color="White">and more unstable climates and
more severe weather events.</font>

02:26:58.739 --> 02:26:59.869
<font color="White">They have to be addressed
in terms of</font>

02:27:00.086 --> 02:27:02.695
<font color="White">fundamentally changing the way
in which we produce our food,</font>

02:27:02.956 --> 02:27:05.000
<font color="White">which makes it more resilient.</font>

02:27:08.043 --> 02:27:12.347
<font color="White">And the only thing
that really looks promising</font>

02:27:12.608 --> 02:27:15.608
<font color="White">is to get back to
the fundamentals of the soil.</font>

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:21.478
<font color="White">We can sequester over 3 tons
of carbon dioxide per acre</font>

02:27:22.130 --> 02:27:23.913
<font color="White">with organic
regenerative methods,</font>

02:27:24.130 --> 02:27:26.043
<font color="White">whereas conventional
chemical-based agriculture</font>

02:27:26.304 --> 02:27:28.000
<font color="White">emits carbon dioxide.</font>

02:27:28.391 --> 02:27:32.913
<font color="White">So we would solve
so many problems</font>

02:27:33.217 --> 02:27:35.434
<font color="White">if we would just get the biology
back into the soil.</font>

02:27:35.695 --> 02:27:36.521
<font color="White">Stop killing it!</font>

02:27:40.739 --> 02:27:43.391
<font color="White">When the colonialists
came here in New England,</font>

02:27:43.652 --> 02:27:45.130
<font color="White">this became a key area</font>

02:27:45.391 --> 02:27:47.695
<font color="White">to produce food
for the Burlington area.</font>

02:27:48.521 --> 02:27:49.695
<font color="White">In the middle
of the 20th century,</font>

02:27:49.956 --> 02:27:52.478
<font color="White">we began to see the
transformation of agriculture,</font>

02:27:52.739 --> 02:27:54.260
<font color="White">so that local food production</font>

02:27:54.521 --> 02:27:56.086
<font color="White">began to move further
and further away.</font>

02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:00.739
<font color="White">Those farms essentially became
difficult to stay in business</font>

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:04.608
<font color="White">as they competed with
food from around the planet.</font>

02:28:06.608 --> 02:28:09.478
<font color="White">And when we got here,
which was 30 years ago,</font>

02:28:09.739 --> 02:28:11.478
<font color="White">there was one farm left:</font>

02:28:11.739 --> 02:28:13.000
<font color="White">the last dairy in Burlington,</font>

02:28:13.260 --> 02:28:17.217
<font color="White">run by a 90-plus-year-old woman,
and she was just hanging on.</font>

02:28:17.913 --> 02:28:22.086
<font color="White">We started to take on the
restoration of this flood plain,</font>

02:28:22.347 --> 02:28:23.521
<font color="White">which had become</font>

02:28:23.782 --> 02:28:25.913
<font color="White">a dumping ground
for the city of Burlington.</font>

02:28:29.913 --> 02:28:32.826
<font color="White">And we saw this as
just an exciting opportunity</font>

02:28:33.043 --> 02:28:34.956
<font color="White">to imagine the transformation</font>

02:28:35.173 --> 02:28:37.521
<font color="White">of the food system which was
what our business was about:</font>

02:28:37.782 --> 02:28:40.130
<font color="White">producing local food
in your garden.</font>

02:28:42.565 --> 02:28:44.782
<font color="White">This is a flood plain
sandy soil.</font>

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.478
<font color="White">We had lost almost all
the organic matter in the soil.</font>

02:28:47.739 --> 02:28:50.304
<font color="White">One of the things we could do
is we could take all the waste</font>

02:28:50.565 --> 02:28:53.608
<font color="White">from the community
in terms of food waste</font>

02:28:53.869 --> 02:28:56.130
<font color="White">and yard waste, and instead
of taking it to the dump,</font>

02:28:56.391 --> 02:28:58.521
<font color="White">we could put it into
a compost project.</font>

02:28:58.782 --> 02:29:01.913
<font color="White">That compost has brought
the fertility back up to</font>

02:29:02.130 --> 02:29:04.695
<font color="White">4% or 5% organic matter
in the soil.</font>

02:29:04.956 --> 02:29:07.347
<font color="White">That then gave us
the capacity</font>

02:29:07.608 --> 02:29:11.217
<font color="White">to incubate and create the farms
that are down here now.</font>

02:29:12.391 --> 02:29:14.173
<font color="White">1/10th of 1% of the food
eaten in Burlington</font>

02:29:14.434 --> 02:29:15.565
<font color="White">was coming from Burlington,</font>

02:29:15.826 --> 02:29:16.521
<font color="White">and we had a goal of</font>

02:29:16.782 --> 02:29:19.086
<font color="White">"Could it become 10%
of the fresh food?"</font>

02:29:19.347 --> 02:29:21.826
<font color="White">We’re in Vermont, it’s cold,
so you can’t do it all year,</font>

02:29:22.217 --> 02:29:23.086
<font color="White">but we’re getting awfully close</font>

02:29:23.347 --> 02:29:25.869
<font color="White">to 10% of Burlington’s
fresh food</font>

02:29:26.391 --> 02:29:29.956
<font color="White">that’s consumed here now being
produced here in the Intervale.</font>

02:29:31.130 --> 02:29:33.521
<font color="White">There are now 13 farms
down here, they share</font>

02:29:33.782 --> 02:29:36.521
<font color="White">greenhouses,
tractors and irrigation.</font>

02:29:36.869 --> 02:29:38.782
<font color="White">They are now sharing
refrigeration</font>

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.478
<font color="White">and distribution,
so we have a food hub</font>

02:29:41.782 --> 02:29:45.000
<font color="White">that actually aggregates
their available excess supply</font>

02:29:45.217 --> 02:29:47.434
<font color="White">and gets it out efficiently
into the community.</font>

02:29:48.086 --> 02:29:50.217
<font color="White">We actually have
about a dozen employers</font>

02:29:50.478 --> 02:29:53.347
<font color="White">who have supported
the idea of a CSA</font>

02:29:53.695 --> 02:29:56.565
<font color="White">where we actually
are distributing weekly</font>

02:29:56.826 --> 02:29:57.739
<font color="White">to their employees,</font>

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.782
<font color="White">we deliver right
to their places of employment.</font>

02:30:01.217 --> 02:30:04.000
<font color="White">So the employers began to
realize the value of local food,</font>

02:30:04.260 --> 02:30:06.043
<font color="White">health and connecting
their employees</font>

02:30:06.304 --> 02:30:07.391
<font color="White">to the local food system.</font>

02:30:11.608 --> 02:30:14.000
<font color="White">This is not
just happening in Vermont.</font>

02:30:14.217 --> 02:30:16.086
<font color="White">It’s happening
all over the country.</font>

02:30:16.347 --> 02:30:17.956
<font color="White">So we have people
knocking on our door</font>

02:30:18.173 --> 02:30:20.826
<font color="White">saying, "Could we
do this in our community?"</font>

02:30:21.043 --> 02:30:24.217
<font color="White">The simplest answer is make sure
you’ve got fertile soil.</font>

02:30:24.478 --> 02:30:26.043
<font color="White">If you don’t,
figure out how to get there.</font>

02:30:26.304 --> 02:30:27.434
<font color="White">And get it accessible</font>

02:30:27.695 --> 02:30:29.869
<font color="White">so that it’s not too expensive
for people to farm.</font>

02:30:30.130 --> 02:30:32.130
<font color="White">Make sure that you can
support young people</font>

02:30:32.391 --> 02:30:35.130
<font color="White">to be able to be successful
at farming,</font>

02:30:36.478 --> 02:30:38.347
<font color="White">and make sure
that the market is there</font>

02:30:38.608 --> 02:30:40.043
<font color="White">so that they can make
a good living.</font>

02:30:40.304 --> 02:30:42.173
<font color="White">You put those things together
in a dynamic,</font>

02:30:42.434 --> 02:30:45.478
<font color="White">interrelated way
where policy plays a role,</font>

02:30:45.739 --> 02:30:47.956
<font color="White">but ultimately,
it’s the economic system</font>

02:30:48.173 --> 02:30:52.000
<font color="White">that is that which is driving,
I think, our future success.</font>

02:30:54.260 --> 02:30:56.000
<font color="White">One of the things
that works here,</font>

02:30:56.260 --> 02:30:59.304
<font color="White">and in many old cities
you have that same situation,</font>

02:30:59.565 --> 02:31:03.434
<font color="White">is a forgotten bunch of land
next to rivers</font>

02:31:03.695 --> 02:31:05.739
<font color="White">that actually are fairly fertile</font>

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
<font color="White">and could be
brought back to life.</font>

02:31:09.913 --> 02:31:13.695
<font color="White">And sort of the integration
of people to agriculture is...</font>

02:31:13.956 --> 02:31:17.043
<font color="White">a lot of what this
new food system is about.</font>

02:31:30.478 --> 02:31:33.434
<font color="White">One seed you plant,
you get a thousand.</font>

02:31:37.478 --> 02:31:40.478
<font color="White">Thousands seeds you plant,
you get a million.</font>

02:31:44.695 --> 02:31:46.695
<font color="White">Fertility really is
the power of the soil</font>

02:31:46.956 --> 02:31:47.869
<font color="White">to keep producing.</font>

02:31:48.086 --> 02:31:50.434
<font color="White">The power of the seed
to keep reproducing,</font>

02:31:50.695 --> 02:31:53.086

02:32:22.173 --> 02:32:23.565

02:32:23.826 --> 02:32:25.913
<font color="White">in 2008 the final report
came out</font>

02:32:28.260 --> 02:32:31.000
<font color="White">that the answer
is not high tech.</font>

<font color="White">Genetic engineering is not going
to save agriculture.</font>

<font color="White">Neither is nanotechnology or
these high tech solutions.</font>

02:32:37.739 --> 02:32:39.304
<font color="White">But the answer is</font>

02:32:39.565 --> 02:32:43.391
<font color="White">this more ecologically-
rational agroecology.</font>

02:32:45.260 --> 02:32:46.956
<font color="White">The question is:</font>

02:32:47.173 --> 02:32:51.565
<font color="White">"Can organic, sustainable
agroecology feed the world?"</font>

02:32:51.826 --> 02:32:53.652
<font color="White">Sure, it can.
And I know this because</font>

02:32:53.913 --> 02:32:56.478
<font color="White">I was involved myself
a lot of research in Africa.</font>

02:32:56.739 --> 02:32:57.608
<font color="White">We have quadrupled,</font>

02:32:57.869 --> 02:33:00.478
<font color="White">up to even 10 times, more yield,</font>

02:33:00.739 --> 02:33:03.869
<font color="White">totally sustainable,
organic actually,</font>

02:33:04.086 --> 02:33:06.043
<font color="White">by doing the right thing
and by building soil.</font>

02:33:06.304 --> 02:33:08.652
<font color="White">So the yields go up
year after year,</font>

02:33:08.913 --> 02:33:10.478
<font color="White">to reach levels which,</font>

02:33:10.739 --> 02:33:12.956
<font color="White">if every African farmer
would produce</font>

02:33:13.304 --> 02:33:14.608
<font color="White">according to some
of those systems,</font>

02:33:14.869 --> 02:33:17.826
<font color="White">there would be plenty of food
around for everybody.</font>

02:33:24.521 --> 02:33:26.434
<font color="White">But...there’s a but here too,</font>

02:33:26.695 --> 02:33:30.304
<font color="White">it doesn’t fill the pockets of
a few business people.</font>

02:33:30.565 --> 02:33:33.521
<font color="White">It just helps the farmer
and the consumer.</font>

02:33:33.956 --> 02:33:36.913
<font color="White">And we have to widen this stem
to make sure that</font>

02:33:37.130 --> 02:33:39.956
<font color="White">there’s more connections
from farm to consumer</font>

02:33:40.173 --> 02:33:42.000
<font color="White">and also more people in between.</font>

02:33:42.260 --> 02:33:44.130
<font color="White">It’s important because
agriculture needs input-output,</font>

02:33:44.391 --> 02:33:45.521
<font color="White">no matter what you do.</font>

02:33:52.652 --> 02:33:55.565
<font color="White">And you can imagine two possible
alternative futures,</font>

02:33:55.826 --> 02:33:58.608
<font color="White">if we continue
to aggressively pursue</font>

02:33:58.869 --> 02:34:00.521
<font color="White">plow-based
conventional agriculture</font>

02:34:00.782 --> 02:34:02.695
<font color="White">the way that we are
at present...</font>

02:34:02.956 --> 02:34:05.434
<font color="White">We'll eventually deplete
the supply of soil.</font>

02:34:05.826 --> 02:34:07.913
<font color="White">Eventually the areas
of highly fertile,</font>

02:34:08.130 --> 02:34:09.826
<font color="White">highly productive
agricultural soils</font>

02:34:10.043 --> 02:34:12.260
<font color="White">will become very valuable
and fought-over.</font>

02:34:13.304 --> 02:34:15.739
<font color="White">They will become sort of
the central organizing element</font>

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:17.695
<font color="White">of the geopolitical reality.</font>

02:34:17.956 --> 02:34:21.652
<font color="White">Why? Well because soil is
THE fundamental resource.</font>

02:34:24.130 --> 02:34:27.391
<font color="White">On the other hand,
agricultural techniques</font>

02:34:27.652 --> 02:34:29.956
<font color="White">like intensive organic
agriculture and no-till</font>

02:34:30.173 --> 02:34:31.913
<font color="White">that can produce
large crops of food</font>

02:34:32.130 --> 02:34:33.086
<font color="White">without depleting the soil</font>

02:34:33.347 --> 02:34:35.347
<font color="White">and in many cases,
actually improving soil quality.</font>

02:34:35.695 --> 02:34:39.521
<font color="White">It would encourage small-scale
labor-intensive organic farms</font>

02:34:39.782 --> 02:34:41.608
<font color="White">that would supply
what's coming to be known</font>

02:34:41.869 --> 02:34:44.000
<font color="White">as the "local food movement."</font>

02:34:51.739 --> 02:34:53.173
<font color="White">Two very different futures,</font>

02:34:53.434 --> 02:34:55.826
<font color="White">both of them totally possible.</font>

02:34:56.043 --> 02:34:59.652
<font color="White">And the mechanisms that may
guide us toward one or the other</font>

02:34:59.913 --> 02:35:01.043
<font color="White">are gonna evolve</font>

02:35:01.304 --> 02:35:04.869
<font color="White">from what consumers choose to do
with their food dollars,</font>

02:35:05.086 --> 02:35:06.739
<font color="White">and what governments
tend to encourage,</font>

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.391
<font color="White">subsidize and or penalize
or regulate.</font>

02:35:09.652 --> 02:35:11.260
<font color="White">The future is wide open.</font>

02:35:11.695 --> 02:35:14.695
<font color="White">Back in the 1960s,
the chemical companies</font>

02:35:14.956 --> 02:35:18.478
<font color="White">tried to sell the idea that
chemistry was better</font>

02:35:18.739 --> 02:35:20.043
<font color="White">than life forces.</font>

02:35:20.304 --> 02:35:23.173
<font color="White">And they called this "better
living through chemistry."</font>

02:35:23.434 --> 02:35:24.347
<font color="White">But now through science,</font>

02:35:24.608 --> 02:35:26.782
<font color="White">we understand that
there's lots of side effects</font>

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.695
<font color="White">from the chemical approaches
to food and agriculture.</font>

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:33.565
<font color="White">So we call this
"better living through biology."</font>

02:35:33.869 --> 02:35:35.695
<font color="White">When you go to this system,</font>

02:35:35.956 --> 02:35:37.608
<font color="White">the soil returns</font>

02:35:37.869 --> 02:35:41.739
<font color="White">to what it was like when
it was first broken out.</font>

02:35:42.260 --> 02:35:44.086
<font color="White">You go out there and
you start digging in that,</font>

02:35:44.347 --> 02:35:46.260
<font color="White">that's just an awesome thing,
you know?</font>

02:36:18.739 --> 02:36:23.521
<font color="White">In the original Hebrew,
Adam is the masculine form</font>

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.913
<font color="White">of the Hebrew word "adama."</font>

02:36:27.130 --> 02:36:29.869
<font color="White">"Adama" is soil.</font>

02:36:30.608 --> 02:36:34.173
<font color="White">So Adam literally
means "earthling,"</font>

02:36:34.608 --> 02:36:38.521
<font color="White">and as described in
the second chapter of Genesis,</font>

02:36:39.043 --> 02:36:43.434
<font color="White">Adam is fashioned by God
out of "adama,"</font>

02:36:43.695 --> 02:36:45.347
<font color="White">out of the earth.</font>

02:36:46.478 --> 02:36:49.391
<font color="White">The translation is
"the dust of the earth,"</font>

02:36:49.652 --> 02:36:53.217
<font color="White">but it’s really the "afar,"
the material of the soil.</font>

02:36:57.043 --> 02:36:58.956
<font color="White">And now the question is:</font>

02:36:59.173 --> 02:37:00.347
<font color="White">Adam’s mate.</font>

02:37:00.913 --> 02:37:04.478
<font color="White">In Hebrew "Havah,"
or in English rendered Eve.</font>

02:37:04.739 --> 02:37:08.086
<font color="White">"Havah" means literally
"life" or "life giver."</font>

02:37:08.826 --> 02:37:11.086
<font color="White">So the combination
of Adam and Eve</font>

02:37:11.347 --> 02:37:16.000
<font color="White">mean quite literally
soil and life,</font>

02:37:16.521 --> 02:37:20.173
<font color="White">perceiving that life is
associated with the soil.</font>

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:24.521
<font color="White">Adam and Eve are placed
in the Garden of Eden,</font>

02:37:24.782 --> 02:37:27.608
<font color="White">which means literally
the Garden of Delights,</font>

02:37:27.869 --> 02:37:29.739
<font color="White">which is nature,</font>

02:37:31.217 --> 02:37:34.695
<font color="White">and given an assignment.</font>

02:37:36.608 --> 02:37:38.086
<font color="White">Not mastery,</font>

02:37:38.347 --> 02:37:40.000
<font color="White">but a role,</font>

02:37:40.347 --> 02:37:41.260
<font color="White">a task:</font>

02:37:42.347 --> 02:37:44.913
<font color="White">to serve and preserve.</font>

02:37:45.130 --> 02:37:48.173
<font color="White">It says in Hebrew,
"l’ovdah ul’shomrah."</font>

02:37:49.217 --> 02:37:52.869
<font color="White">The King James translation says
"to dress it and keep it,"</font>

02:37:53.086 --> 02:37:54.478
<font color="White">but my translation is</font>

02:37:54.739 --> 02:37:57.391
<font color="White">"to serve it
and to preserve it."</font>

02:39:01.434 --> 02:39:06.000
<font color="White">We banish ourselves from the
Garden of Eden by despoiling it.</font>

02:39:09.086 --> 02:39:11.000
<font color="White">And when mothers
see their children</font>

02:39:11.260 --> 02:39:12.826
<font color="White">playing in the soil now,</font>

02:39:13.043 --> 02:39:16.043
<font color="White">they say, "Oh, that’s dirty,"
and they rapidly,</font>

02:39:16.304 --> 02:39:19.000
<font color="White">quickly wash their hands
of the dirt.</font>

02:39:19.478 --> 02:39:23.130
<font color="White">And we misapply that
terrible word "dirt" to soil,</font>

02:39:23.391 --> 02:39:27.000
<font color="White">which is the fount of
all cleanliness, by the way.</font>

02:39:33.434 --> 02:39:36.304
<font color="White">Think of all
the many generations</font>

02:39:36.565 --> 02:39:38.826
<font color="White">of people in past generations</font>

02:39:39.043 --> 02:39:41.043
<font color="White">who’ve died
of all manner of disease,</font>

02:39:41.304 --> 02:39:44.217
<font color="White">and somehow
the soil cleanses them all,</font>

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:50.478

into the materials of life.</font>
