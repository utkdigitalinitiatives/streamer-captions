00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
COMPUTER:
 The directions for a human
 being are written in code

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
three billion letters long.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
These instructions tell
 our bodies how to live,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
how to grow, how to die.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Researchers call this code
 "The Sequence."

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Just ten years ago a genetic
cures for diseases like OCD seem

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
like a dream
of the very far off future.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
That's because we didn't know
how to read the DNA--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the genetic code-- fast enough.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Without the big picture--

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
the entire genome
of any particular organism--

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
we couldn't analyze
what was wrong with its genes.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But now we can.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It was the challenge
to decode the human genome

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that got scientists inspired

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to come up with the technology
to do it,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and that technology
has transformed

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the life sciences
and the laboratory.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
( computer beeps )

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
COMPUTER:
The basic tools
of gene sequencing

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
are bacteria, robots
and computers.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
After DNA is pulled out of cells

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and broken up into random
fragments by enzymes,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
it is inserted into bacteria.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The bacteria then do what
bacteria do best-- multiply.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But as the bacteria divide,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
they're also making new copies
of the DNA fragments.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Then pipetting robots separate

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
the millions and millions of
DNA fragments from the bacteria.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
PCR machines make
millions more copies

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
of the refined DNA fragments

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and color-code
each A, G, C and T.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The gene sequencer lines up
all the fragments

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and reads out the last letter
of each fragment

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
from the shortest
to the longest.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
This spells out the sequence
of the fragment.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Once the sequence
of a chunk of DNA is known,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
it goes into
a powerful computer,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
which looks
for overlapping sequences

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
so it can reassemble
the whole genome.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
MAN:
What's exciting
about the lab of the future

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
as opposed
to the lab of the past

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
is that we're increasingly able
to take global views

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
of what's going on
inside a cell.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
We may think about the cell
as some tiny little entity,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
but when you imagine
what's going on in that cell,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
it's vast.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
There are 30,000 genes

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
making perhaps 100,000, 200,000
different types of proteins

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that interact with each other
in just myriad different ways.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
SEVERSON:
Enough information exists to
fill 5,000 encyclopedia volumes,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
or one million pages,
and it all has to be analyzed.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
To study the genetic parts list

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
of the tiny factory
that is a human cell,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
a whole new set of tools
had to be invented.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
LANDER:
In order to turn this
into a process

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
in which we could generate
millions and tens of millions

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
of letters of DNA
every single day,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
we had to rethink and automate
all of these approaches.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And so it involved a... a pretty
thoroughgoing reevaluation--

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
uh, lots of, you know,
technical details,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
but the basic notion was we had
to reinvent the biochemistry

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
so that a robot could do it.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
SEVERSON:
The robot turns out information
and data at a fantastic rate.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
It can sequence 70 million
base pairs of DNA in a day--

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
a lifetime of work for many
biologists doing it the old way.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
LANDER:
The whole mind frame
of a biologist has to change

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
to now look for answers
in a sea not of one picture

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000
or one microscope slide but in
billions of bits of information,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and traditionally
in the 20th century,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
biologists didn't think a lot

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
about billions of bits
of information.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
SEVERSON:
These bits come in bytes
from all over the world.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Thanks to the Internet,
sharing information is easy.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Data, gene banks,
reports of discoveries

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
are all available
almost instantly.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Bioinformatics is critical

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
for managing the global flow
of information.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
WOMAN:
As we're taking
this global view,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
we're acquiring data

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
at a rate that was inconceivable
even just a few years ago.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Every year we double the amount
of data that we have to store.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
When you have this kind
of scale of data,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
then the analytic skills
that can be brought to bear

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
by a physicist, by a
mathematician, by an astronomer,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that becomes
very, very important.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
SEVERSON:
John Rioux is
a research scientist.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
His partner, Mark Daly,
is a computational analyst.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
They are investigating
the genetic connection

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
with Crohn's disease,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
an inflammatory disease
of the digestive tract.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
MAN:
For Crohn's disease, uh, 
had we gotten to a region

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
of the genome a few years ago,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
we would had
to have spent many years

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
just to identify all
the sequence in that region,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
identify the genes
within that region

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and to identify all the
genetic variants of those genes.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Uh, essentially right now
we can go to the Web

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and find all that we need
to know within a few minutes,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and what we've been focusing on
more recently

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
is how to understand
how the genetic variants, uh,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
are in patterns and how we can
associate that with disease.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
SEVERSON:
It takes very powerful computers
and innovative computer programs

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
to analyze and make sense of
billions of bits of information.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It also requires a different
approach to making discoveries.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
LANDER:
The lab of the future is
not just the biologist's lab.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
We need to bring together
all of the different disciplines

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that can detect
and analyze processes and data.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Mathematicians,
computer scientists, engineers,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
automation experts, chemists...

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It's about a different community
of minds coming together.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Biology for the first time
is about information.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It's become
an information science

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
in a way that it wasn't
in the 20th century,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and that's just causing
a radical change

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
in the way biologists
approach problems.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
SEVERSON:
Diseases like diabetes, cancer
and Alzheimer's

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
have so far defied science.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
The lab of the future
is tackling them differently,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
piecing together the circuit
of cellular life

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and trying to understand what
happens when the circuit fails.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
So, this has all
9,000 spots on it.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
9,600.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
SEVERSON:
This is a DNA microarray--

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
another tool in the lab
of the future.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Here it shows what all the genes
are doing in a cancer cell.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Cancer has a complex
genetic profile.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
MAN:
Each of the spots

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
on this microarray represents
a different gene

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
in a patient's leukemia cell,
and by looking at the color--

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the intensity
of each of these spots--

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
we can see how much activity
there is for each of these genes

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
in that patient's tumor.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
As recently
as four or five years ago,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
one person could measure perhaps
two or three of these genes, uh,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
every two or three days,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and now we're able
to measure tens of thousands

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
of these spots simultaneously
day in and day out.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
SEVERSON:
Technology
isn't doing everything.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Biologists are
still hard at work.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
But now the two
are inextricably connected,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
working in tandem
to gain a new perspective

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
about cellular activity
as a whole.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
LANDER:
What we're really seeing now
is the ability

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
to complement that
component-by-component approach

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
with a global overview,
and it's... it's that duality

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
between looking
at the individual parts

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and looking at them together
as a system

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
that I think will be
really powerful.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
The biological laboratory

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
is changing at just
an incredibly rapid pace

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
so that the lab of the future
is always advancing.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Will the laboratory
of the future ever just be here

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and will be done?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
No, of course not, because
the future is always tomorrow,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and I think
for as far out as I can see,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
there are more and more
better ideas

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
for probing the cell
more deeply,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and so the lab of the future
is a work in progress.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
By now, most of us
are familiar

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
with the image
of the twisted ladder,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
or double-helix structure
of DNA.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
The year 2003 will mark
the 50-year anniversary

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
of the discovery
of this structure,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
a discovery that changed the way
we perceive ourselves.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Not long after the discovery,
researchers began studying

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
the mysteries
of this blueprint for life

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
by focusing on one gene
at a time.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
But today,
with advanced machines,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
we are able to get a much bigger
picture of genetic expression.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
MAN:
Years ago, we used to work
on one gene for ten years--

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
20 years sometimes--
and we'd do work

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and over and over to do work
and try to get it isolated,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
trying to clone it, do all
the, you know, what?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Produce protein from it.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And now to think that you can
take this technology

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and look at 33,000 genes
overnight is just...

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
it's an amazing advancement
in the science.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
SEVERSON:
What has enabled scientists
to make this leap

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
from studying one gene at a time
to thousands

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
is something called
microarray analysis.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
The technique has become an
essential tool for scientists.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Microarrays allow us
to ask the question

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
of what gene activities occur
in a set of samples.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
They could be a pair of samples,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
they could be five samples,
100 samples,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
but what are the gene activity
differences

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
that distinguish one set
of samples from another.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
SEVERSON:
By studying gene activity,
or gene expression,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
scientists can begin
to understand

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
the molecular process--
how genes express themselves.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
COMPUTER VOICE:
About gene expression:

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Within the nucleus of each cell
are long strings of DNA

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
made up of sequences
we call genes.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Each gene carries a unique set
of instructions,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
directing the cell
to produce a specific protein--

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
the building blocks of life.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Each gene turns on and off

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
at different times
in the life of a cell.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
This activity is called
gene expression.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
By studying how and when
genes express--

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
when they turn on and off--

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
we can better understand
what makes each person unique,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
what causes disease,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and how disease
may be genetically treated.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
SEVERSON:
Microarray analysis
is common now

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
in laboratories
across the world.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Two methods are used
to create microarrays.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
One uses sophisticated robots,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
tissue samples from which
the DNA will be extracted

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and old-fashioned glass slides.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
( robot whirs tray into place )

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
THOMPSON:
Spotted arrays, in essence,
are microscope slides

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
onto which we use robotics

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
to spot a very small solution
of DNA.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
The robot tracks exactly
the position of each DNA spot,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and that information
is critical.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
SEVERSON:
The heart of microarray analysis
is DNA itself,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
which is made up
of four base proteins.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
A device called a writer

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
stacks these base proteins
in precise spots--

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
as many as 22,000 spots--
on the surface of a glass chip

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
and keeps track
of where they were put.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Then, depending on
how the genes are expressing,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
they will bond
in specific patterns

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
with the DNA stacks on glass,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
a bit like how a crossword
puzzle fits together.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
The fluorescent tags are then
scanned or excited by a laser.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
The red and green colors reveal

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
complex patterns indicating
genes at work-- or not.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
The colors indicate,
you know,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
sort of levels
of gene activity...

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
THOMPSON:
We then analyze or use these
microarrays in an experiment

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
where we'll have
two different biological samples

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
where... in which we want
to ask the question

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
"Well, what are
the gene-activity differences

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
between them?"

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And at the end of that,
we basically end up getting

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
very long, Excel-like
spreadsheets of information

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
that relate DNA identity
in one column

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
with sort of gene activity
in another column.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
SEVERSON:
The other type of microarray
analysis uses something

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
called gene chips.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
These small chips, about the
size of your fingernail, contain

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
tiny synthetic fragments of DNA.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Each chip enables us

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
to analyze 18,000 genes
in the human genome,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
a far cry from
our limited abilities

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
to look at one gene at a time
only a few years ago.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Following a similar method
of color coding and analysis,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
scientists are able
to get a visual road map

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
of what genetic signals
are turned on or off

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
in a specific sample,
and to what degree.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
JOHNSON:
What you're seeing is
the image from the chip.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
So, after we put
the sample in the chip

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
and went through the process
of... of scanning it

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
what you'll get is
a bunch of little squares.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And each of these little squares
is what they call a feature.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And the feature is
what is telling you

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
the level of expression, or how
high the gene is in your sample.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And, for example, you can see,
the intense white means

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
there's a lot of that transcript
in the sample.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Whereas if it's dark blue,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
that means there is
basically nothing there;

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
so that chip is not able
to detect any of that message.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
SEVERSON:
In both methods
of microarray analysis,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
by comparing one set of genes
against a control sample,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
scientists are able to see what
specific genes are different.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
JOHNSON:
So what it allows us to do is
it allows us to eliminate

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
all of the genes
that are unaffected,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
but just look at the genes

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
that are either increased
or decreased

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
relative to the control.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
So hopefully
out of the 33,000 genes,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
we will get down to a very
small, like 10 percent or less,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
of genes that are
actually different

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
between the two samples.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And then we can really...
focus in on those genes

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and try to identify
their function.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
THOMPSON:
Once we have a handle on
the 30, the 50, the 112 genes

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
that might really describe
a particular disease condition,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
we don't necessarily need
to continue to monitor

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
all 30,000 or 50,000 genes--

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
however many there are
in the genome--

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
and we can be more specific.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
So you can imagine this tool
being used clinically

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
to assess, you know,
whether a person is responding

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
to a particular therapy

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
or even actually has
a particular disease.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
This technology is allowing
scientists to ask questions

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
they've never been able
to ask before,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
by giving them access

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
to the genetic specs
of the blueprint of life.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
By all accounts
Francis Collins

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
is one of the giants
of genomic research.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
He's director
of the U.S. government's

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
National Human Genome
Research Institute.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
On June 26, 2000, President
Clinton honored Collins,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
along with genetics entrepreneur
Craig Venter,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
for mapping the first draft
of the human genome.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
It was an accomplishment
that may prove more significant

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
than smashing the atom

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
or landing the first man
on the moon.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Our talking encyclopedia,
I'm sure,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
is just dying to tell you
all about him.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
COMPUTER:
Francis Collins,
born Francis Sellers Collins,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
April 14, 1950
in Staunton, Virginia.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Raised on a farm.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Home-schooled
until the sixth grade.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Bachelor of Science,
University of Virginia, 1970.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Ph.D., Yale University, 1974.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Doctor of Internal Medicine,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
University
of North Carolina, 1977.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Part of a team
that discovered the gene

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
for cystic fibrosis, 1989.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Became director
of the U.S. Humane Genome
Research Institute, 1993.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Committed Christian.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Likes to play guitar.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000
( playing guitar )

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
SEVERSON:
When he's not playing guitar
at holiday parties,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Francis Collins is a busy man.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
The sequencing of the genome

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
was just the start of
the process of discovery.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
He believes the genome map
has launched

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
a new era in science--
the genomic age.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
COLLINS:
Well, I think what's happened
is so historical,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
that it deserves to be denoted
by some significant description,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
and maybe "the genomic age"
is a reasonable one.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
We have been trying
to understand ourselves

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
without the information

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
contained in
our own instruction book.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
But now we have it,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
and we'll never go back again
to that position of ignorance

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
that we have been in
for millennia.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And the challenge for us
is to figure out how to read it

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
and then apply it
to benefit humankind.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
SEVERSON:
Collins believes that by 2020,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
there will be gene-based
designer drugs for diabetes,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
hypertension, heart disease
and schizophrenia.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Cancer treatment
will be transformed,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
and every patient
will be prescribed medicines

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
that are tailored
to his own genetic fingerprint.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Big expectations,
but Collins says genetics

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
is taking a lot of
the trial-and-error guesswork

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
out of making medicine.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
COLLINS:
Genetics is so compelling
because it does allow you to go

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
right to the most
basic molecular level

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
of what is wrong
in this disease

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
and lay that out
in very clear terms,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
and that, in turn, gives you
ideas about therapy

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
that you never would have
arrived at empirically.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Comparing
this to that...

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
COLLINS:
So we are trying to come up
with a technology

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
that will allow you to associate

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
any variant letter with
a disease like diabetes.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
SEVERSON:
Adult-onset diabetes
is Collins' latest target,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
and he is passionate about
finding a genetic cure,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
but that'll be a very tough job.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
COLLINS:
This is orders of magnitude
more difficult

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
than anything
we've ever tried to do.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And it would have been called
completely silly

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
to even undertake this
a few years ago.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
But now with the tools
of the genome project,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
it becomes at least imaginable

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
that we might be able
to succeed at this.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
And if we could find the genes

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
that contribute
to adult-onset diabetes,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
each one of those would be
a wonderful opportunity

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
to shine a bright light
into this mystery

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
of why this disease comes about,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
which is really
a very big mystery.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
And that would lead us
to new therapies

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
that might be
much more effective

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
than what we currently have.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
SEVERSON:
Collins is also one
of the self-anointed "watchdogs"

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
of genetics because,
for all its potential for good,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
there is equal cause
for concern.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Genetic testing, for instance,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
raises fears
about genetic privacy.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
COLLINS:
I've ended up spending
a very large fraction of my time

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
on these ethical, legal
and social issues,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
because if we don't
get these right,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
all of these wonderful medical
advances won't get us very far

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
because people will be afraid
to take advantage of them

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
and that would be
a terrible tragedy.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
They're afraid the information
might get used against them,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
and we can't honestly tell them
that that's an unwarranted fear.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
I would like to be able to say
it's an unwarranted fear.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
It will take more action on the
policy side to make that happen.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
SEVERSON:
And if people do decide to find
out about their genetic traits,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
will they try to create
designer babies?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
COLLINS:
Well, I think a lot of people
are wondering

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
what's going to happen
down the road.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
It's great to use genetics
to cure terrible disease.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I haven't met too many people
who are opposed to that.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
But when you get
outside of disease

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
into things that
are really more traits,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
where are the boundaries here

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
and how far do we want to go
in that direction?

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
SEVERSON:
Not only is genetics
the most controversial

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
of the life sciences,
it is also the most expensive.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Collins asks the U.S. Congress

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
for tens of millions of dollars
every year,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
just to keep the Human Genome
Project in operation.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
At the same time,
the genomics industry

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
has made a lot of millionaires.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Many of his colleagues,
like Craig Venter,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
left their government jobs

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
for the wealth and freedom
of the private sector,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
but not Collins.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
COLLINS:
Well, being a federal
scientist-physician

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
is certainly not
the way to get rich.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
But on my scale of what
really matters in life,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
what I hope to do
is to participate

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
in something meaningful,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
to do something
for other people,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
and this gives me
an opportunity,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
like nothing I ever could have
imagined, to do just that.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
SEVERSON:
Francis Collins takes
his mission seriously,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
but he can also poke fun
at himself.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
( crowd cheering
 and applauding )

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Here he's addressing
a graduating class

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
at the University of Virginia.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
( to the tune of "My Way" ):
* Don't talk to me

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
* Go see the dean

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
* Just start today

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
* Love DNA

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
* And do it my way.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
( one person applauding )

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Of course, the sequencing
of the human genome

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
produced as many questions
as answers.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
There's still a lot of work
to be done.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Let's hear about that from
another superstar geneticist,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Eric Lander
of the Whitehead Institute

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
When you run a computer program

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
across the human DNA
to look for genes,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
what you're really looking for
is the portions of DNA

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
that code for proteins according
to the classical genetic code.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
We know how to do that
reasonably well by computer.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
We are almost
completely clueless

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
at running a computer program
across the DNA

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
to look for
the regulation signals

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
that say, "Turn on the gene
in this tissue," like the heart,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
or "at this time,"
when you reach puberty.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
That's the real challenge.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
We'd really like
to be able to read

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
the regulatory code
of the genome,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
and increasingly, I think we're
going to be able to do that.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
But the trick is not by
just looking at the human.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
It's by comparing the sequence
of the human to other organisms,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
like, for example, the mouse,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
a relative of ours
of a hundred million years ago.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Well, it turns out that nature
has lovingly conserved

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
the structural information
for the genes

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
and the regulatory
information.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
And if we line up
the human sequences

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
and the mouse sequences,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
we can see things stand out
clearly as having been preserved

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
that must be regulatory
information.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
We don't quite know how
to interpret all of it yet,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
but just in the past year,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
we've stumbled upon hundreds
of millions of bases

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
of important conserved
regulatory information.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
And if we can understand how
that turns genes on and off,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
we'll learn an awful lot
about the circuitry of life.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Recently a woman
beat the odds

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
in life's most
celebrated lottery:

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
She gave birth
to four identical girls--

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
a phenomenon that only happens
every one in 11 million births.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
The birth of identical twins
is more common,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
one in every 250 births.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
But the story made us wonder

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
about how genetics
might be linked

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
to the phenomena of identical
and fraternal twins.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
COMPUTER:
About twins:

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
To begin with, "identical"
and "fraternal" are inaccurate

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
and misleading terms
when it comes to twins.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
What we call "identical,"

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
scientists
call "monozygotic" twins,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
meaning the result of an egg

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
that has split
following fertilization.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Such twins may or may not
look alike.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
What they are
is genetically identical.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
In the case of so-called
"fraternal" twins,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
scientists use
the term "dizygotic"

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
to describe the result

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
when two sperm fertilize
two different eggs.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Essentially dizygotic twins

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
are just siblings
born at the same time.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
They share, on average,
50% of their genes.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
SEVERSON:
Meet Joe and Jason Zamoiski,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
twin brothers
born four minutes apart.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
28 years later, thanks
to progress in DNA testing,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Joe and Jason can learn

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
exactly what kind of twins
they are: fraternal--

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
I mean, dizygotic--
or monozygotic, identical.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
They don't look much alike
today, but once they did.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
TWIN:
When I look at baby pictures

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
and I look at pictures
when we were younger,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
I can't even
tell us apart.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
I have to ask my mom,
you know, who's who

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
up until
we were probably

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
about three
or four years old
in certain pictures.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
She used to paint
one of our toenails--

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
I don't know who it was--

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
just so she could tell
the difference between us.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
She used to paint
our right pinkie toe,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
and I think that was
your pinkie toe,
by the way.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Okay, well...

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
SEVERSON:
Since birth, Joe and Jason
have believed

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
they came from the same egg.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Their lifestyles
are certainly similar.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
They both chose the same
profession, mortgage banking,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
and they share
an intense emotional bond.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
TWIN:
If I can look at him
and I know pretty much--

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
or if we're sitting
at a dinner table

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
having a conversation,
I know what he's thinking,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
and he knows what
I'm thinking as well.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
TWIN:
Right, we...
it's kind of...

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
it's kind of
like an unwritten,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
like, psychic bond
that we have, no doubt.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Right, we can just
kind of just figure
each other out

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
without having
to say anything.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
That's kind of cool.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Yeah.
You know?

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
SEVERSON:
But it's their differences

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
that make them wonder
about their true "twinship."

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Physically, they're opposites:

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Joe's a lefty,
Jason's right-handed.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
We'll be in a car,
for example,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
or my friend
will be driving,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
and he'll look
in the rear-view mirror

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
and... and freak out
for a second

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
and think that
it was Jason

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
that he's looking at
in the mirror,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
when in actuality
it's me, and vice versa.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
SEVERSON:
The Zamoiski brothers are what
scientists call "mirror twins"--

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
when one twin's
physical features

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
are the opposite of the other.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
The features on Joe's left side
resemble Jason's right side,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
and when they look
in the mirror,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
it reverses the asymmetries.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Well, you be the judge.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
TWIN:
You know, other differences
are obviously,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
physically-wise, you know,
he's an inch taller than I am.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
He weighs about
15 pounds or so
more than I do.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Twenty.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
20 pounds
more than I do.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Um, that has
a lot to do with,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
you know, the fact
that I have Crohn's

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
and Joe doesn't
have Crohn's.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Get on it...

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Get on it!

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
SEVERSON:
It was 11 years ago

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
when Jason was diagnosed
with Crohn's disease.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Crohn's disease is
a gastrointestinal disorder

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
causing inflammation
of the large intestine.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Joe hasn't shown any signs
of Crohn's yet,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
but if he and Jason
are from the same egg,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
he's got a good chance
of getting it--

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Crohn's has a strong
genetic component.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Recently scientists
identified a genetic mutation

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
known as Nod-2 on chromosome 16

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
that has been associated
with the disease

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
in 15% to 20%
of Crohn's patients.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
It is responsible
for encoding a protein

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
that helps
the immune system respond

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
to some types of bacteria.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Give it
a good roll, Sally!

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
MACHIN:
Crohn's disease has been known
for several years to...

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
to cluster in families,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
and there's an increased
frequency of Crohn's disease

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
in brothers and sisters.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
And it looks as though
the likelihood

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
of a co-twin developing
Crohn's disease at some stage

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
when the monozygotic twin
partner has Crohn's disease

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
is something between
25% and 50%,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
whereas for dizygotic twinning,
it's a lot less than that.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
It's in the range
of less than ten percent.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
SEVERSON:
That knowledge alone was enough
to convince Joe and Jason

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
to send away for a DNA test.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
"Using one swab,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
"rub the entire area
of the left cheek

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
inside your mouth."

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
SEVERSON:
The test is remarkably simple--

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
a cotton swab rubbed
on the inside of the mouth

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
will provide enough DNA to
determine whether Joe and Jason

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
are monozygotic
or dizygotic twins.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Seal the bad boy up.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
SEVERSON:
At the lab, scientists analyze
the samples with a PCR test.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
"PCR" stands for
polymerase chain reaction--

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
a process of isolating

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
and duplicating
a particular stretch of DNA.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Dr. Dan Demers is director of
Fairfax Identity Laboratories.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
DEMERS:
In this particular case,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
we're going to have to look at
multiple locations in the genome

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
in order to determine whether
the DNA from the two individuals

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
has an identical pattern or not.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
SEVERSON:
Computers analyze 13 positions

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
at different chromosomes
from each twin

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
and then search for any
four-letter repetitions.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Let's say a repeated sequence
from Jason spells out "A-T-T-C."

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
The computer then compares it

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
with the same sequence
from Joe's DNA.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
If Joe's sequence has
the same letter combination,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
it would prove that he and Jason
have identical genes

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
at that particular point.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
But that's only one point out of
three billion sequenced letters

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
in the 30,000 to 40,000 genes
that make up the human genome.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
So the computer
repeats the process

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
at 13 different points
on the genome,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
which gives them enough
statistical evidence

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
to determine
the twins' zygosity.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Think of it like bar codes

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
on groceries we buy
at the supermarket.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
The lab is identifying
Joe and Jason's bar codes

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
to see if they're the same.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
All's we have to do
is find one difference

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
in their genetic profile,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
and we know they cannot be
identical twins;

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
they must be fraternal twins.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
On the other hand,
in the case of identical twins,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
we can never know
with 100% certainty.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
SEVERSON:
The only way to be
absolutely certain

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
is to sequence the entire genome
of both twins.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
DEMERS:
But for all
intents and purposes,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.000
when you're 99.999%
probability of certainty,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
then that, I think, offers
quite a bit of certainty

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
that they are,
in fact, identical

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
and not fraternal twins.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Our DNA test came in.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
All right.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Let's take a look
at it.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
SEVERSON:
Just ten days after mailing in
their DNA samples,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Joe and Jason get the results.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
"Summary findings:

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
"13 independent genetic
loci were tested.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
"The DNA profiles obtained

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
"from Mr. Joe Zamoiski
and Jason Zamoiski

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
"are identical
at every locus.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Based on this..."

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
SEVERSON:
The waiting is over.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
The secrets of at least
part of their sequence

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
have been revealed.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
So we're
identical twins!

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
All right.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
God, I looked at
my e-mail today...

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
SEVERSON:
Now Joe and his family

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
know his chances of getting
Crohn's disease are higher

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
and they can better
prepare for it.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
MACHIN:
Just because one of the twins
does not have Crohn's disease,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
does not mean that
he might not develop it

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
at some stage in the future.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
But what a great thing
to try to look for it,

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
suggest sensible things
he might to do prevent it,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
and, should he get it, to be
able to offer treatment early

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
and to try and stop him getting
many of the major complications.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
I'll see you later,
all right?

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
SEVERSON:
Genetic science has told
Joe and Jason Zamoiski

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
a lot about each other.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
It also tells us that
when it comes to twins,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
appearances can indeed deceive,
and in more ways than one.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
COMPUTER:
Remember the movie Twins,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
where Danny DeVito
and Arnold Schwarzenegger

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
played identical twins?

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Hollywood producers
actually did their research.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
There's a phenomenon called
"unequal identical twins"

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
caused by unequal cell division
or prenatal conditions.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
One baby may take
all the nutrients

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
and crowd out the other baby
in the womb.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
This results in one baby
developing bigger, stronger

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
and healthier than the other.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
There have even been cases of
opposite-sex monozygotic twins.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Monozygotic twins--
identical twins--

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
who are the opposite sex?

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
As improbable as it seems,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
genetic testing proved it
to be true

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
in the case of 12-year-old
Ricky and Erica Naccarato.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
In the earliest stages
of development,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
when the embryo split,
Ricky got mostly XY chromosomes

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
but Erica only got cells
with one X,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
and girls with a missing X

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
have a disease
called Turner's Syndrome.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Erica is lucky to have reached
this age.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
She's had to undergo
heart surgery

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
and have her ovaries removed.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
The future for her, I'm afraid,
is very uncertain.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Identical twins
who are not identical

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
may be the biggest surprise,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
but genetic studies are
revealing other new details

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
including what causes
twin births

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
to occur in the first place.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
It is widely believed
and understood that dizy...

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
that DZ twins--dizygotic twins--
run in families,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
and that does seem
to be the case.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
And most people, if you read
the books about twins, will say,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
"Well, therefore, MZ twins
don't run in families."

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
And there are very few...
I think there were three papers

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
saying, "Yes, they do
run in families."

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
SEVERSON:
They clearly can run
in families,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
and inside this house
are multiple cases in point.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
WOMAN:
Is that for
your dollhouse?

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
SEVERSON:
Welcome to the Weinsteins.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Here you'll find twin after twin
after twin after twin.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
WOMAN:
Boop!

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
SEVERSON:
And that's just the babies.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
They all come from the same
grandmother, who is also a twin.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Ah, here are
your sister's...

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.000
SEVERSON:
Meet Phyllis..

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Alice...

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Alexandra...

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Nicole...

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Courtney...

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000
and Camryn.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
All twins in the same family.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Phyllis, on the right,
just became a grandma

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
four times over
within five months.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
What do you think?

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
I'm the queen grandma.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
SEVERSON:
For the Weinsteins, fun is
playing the guessing game.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Pardon?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Okay, I have Nicky,
I have Alex,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
um... Courtney and Camryn.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
I think I got it right.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
I think you did.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
WOMAN:
And you are wrong.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
I am?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Courtney and Camryn.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
( chuckles )

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
I think...

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000
I think... this one
has more hair.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Now, what one...?

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Camryn?

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Courtney.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
WOMAN:
Courtney.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
I knew it.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
I have...

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Oh, dear.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
I have Camryn.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
MAN:
Oh, Phyllis, I just
said I was holding...

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Kate had Camryn.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
I have Courtney.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
I thought I knew it!

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
SEVERSON:
With four twin girls
in the family,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
who can blame her
for getting it wrong?

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
After all, she's still in shock.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
PHYLLIS:
Yes, I said

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
I'm absolutely thrilled.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
I never thought
it would happen,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
because I'm
an identical twin,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
and I was always told
it wouldn't run in
our family at all,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
and it was just by chance,
and it happened.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
SEVERSON:
How could this happen?

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
What are the chances?

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
These are the questions
that sparked the curiosity

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
of grandfather
Richard Weinstein.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
The coincidence of finding three
sets of twins in one family,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
I thought, was
rather fascinating;

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
and that sort of got me started.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
He e-mailed me originally
and said he'd got my name,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
and he had figured out
that the chances

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
of having three sets
of twins in the family

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
was one in, you know, X million,
and what did I think.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
And I wrote back and said,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
"Well, sounds like familial
MZ twinning to me--"

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
a well-known phenomenon to me.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
So then there was a silence.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
And he wrote back and said,
"Huh! What's that?" you know.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
SEVERSON:
Dr. Machin has been
studying twins

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
for most of his 30-year career.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
He is convinced that twins
do run in families.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
And after talking to him,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
the grandfather was inspired
to write his own hypothesis.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Within a few months,
he produced an 80-page thesis

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
called "One In Two-Million",

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
chock-full of diagrams,
photographs

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
and a detailed family pedigree
going back many generations.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
There's a total
of nine sets of twins,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
of which eight of them
are same-sex twins.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Your... your likelihood of
having eight same-sex twins...

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
just having that number of twins
says something's going on.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
I mean, there is no doubt
that something is going on.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
There is some sort of trait
in this family constellation

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
that causes this to happen.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
SEVERSON:
But what trait could that be?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Dr. Machin has his own ideas.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
MACHIN:
I think it's probably a mutation

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
in a gene that codes
for proteins

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
that are present on the surface
of cells

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
that keeps cells together,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
make them adhere
to each other.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
But if you have a mutation

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
that... that doesn't keep that
glue so sticky as it should be,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
the cells will tend
to drift apart.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
And so that original
little ball of cells

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
in the first few days
after ovulation

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
might tend more easily
to drift apart

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
into two clones, if you like,
which would make twins.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
SEVERSON:
Dr. Machin wants to go
on a gene search,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
but he needs more evidence.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
First, he thinks the reason
we don't know

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
if monozygotic twins
run in families

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
is because most families
don't know if they have them.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
After all, just because
they don't look identical

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
doesn't mean they aren't
from a single egg.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Machin strongly advocates
DNA testing

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
to determine if twins are
dizygotic or monozygotic,

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
and has been running his own
testing clinic for years.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
We've tested more than 500 pairs
from all over North America,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
and you might be interested
in the results.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Of those 500, 20 were DZ,
and 480 were MZ.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
SEVERSON:
In other words, 96% were
identical or monozygotic.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
As more families find out

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
they have monozygotic twins
rather than dizygotic,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Machin's database
will keep growing.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
And that's the key for starting
a gene search.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
He's already collected
statistics

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
from 50 families
like the Weinsteins.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
RICHARD:
To the best people on Earth--

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
us.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
( all exclaim )

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
ALL:
Cheers.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Doctors still often
misdiagnose twins

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
as monozygotic or dizygotic.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
They used to think the placenta
was a fail-safe indicator

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
of the type of twin,
but that's not always the case.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
COMPUTER:
That is correct.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Dizygotic twins also
have two placentae,

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
but monozygotic twins
can also have two placentae

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
or shared, fused placentae.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Shared, fused placentae
make up one-third,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
or 33%, of monozygotic twins.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
The other two-thirds, or 66%,
of monozygotic twins

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
are born with one placenta.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
The last word
on the causes of twins

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
has yet to be written,
of course.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
We're only beginning
to understand

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
the role genes play in this
and many other aspects

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
of conception
and early development.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000
But in the case of monozygotes
and dizygotes...

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
* And little lambs eat ivy...

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
we can finally tell
which is which.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Mutant

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
The word conjures the strange,
the monstrous,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
something gone terribly wrong
biologically,

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
and the result is, well, scary.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Hollywood horror films are

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
full of mutant beings
doing their mutant thing.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
MAN:
Incredibly huge!

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
WOMAN:
Honey, what's happened?

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
I'm so big!

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
SEVERSON:
Whether it's a giant woman

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
or a human turned into a fly,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
movie mutants are generally
acknowledged to be mistakes

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
or freaks of nature.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Giants! Giants!

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
SEVERSON:
These movies were made

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
about the same time the
double helix was discovered.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Today, we might try and blame
her Amazonian dimensions

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000
on catastrophic mutations
in her developmental genes.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Truth is, mutants and mutations

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
aren't just the stuff
of old "B" movies.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Mutations and mutant genes
are a part of real life, too.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
When do these mutations occur?

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
It varies wildly: some genes
change in less than a day,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
some over a lifetime,
some over centuries.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
It's evolution, and
it isn't just something

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000
that happened a long time ago.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
It's going on right now.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
MAN:
For example, if there is a gene

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
that protects against
an infectious disease,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
and then a wave
of that infection--

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
a plague, if you will--
hits a population,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
you can see that
the copies of the gene

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
that protect against
that infection

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
will be more common
in the offspring,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
because the offspring
that survived

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
had to be resistant
to that disease.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
SEVERSON:
In this way, changes or
mutations in the human genome

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
have gradually collected
and been added over time.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Some are good, and
some are a mixed bag.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
ALTSHULER:
The same DNA change

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
that causes this terrible
disease-- sickle cell anemia--

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
that causes so much suffering,

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
has also been shown to protect
against infection with malaria.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
So in fact, the reason
in some populations

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
that there is a high frequency

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000
of the sickle cell anemia
mutation--

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
you might call it-- is because
the offspring who inherit it

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
are more protected
against malaria.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Is that a shield protecting us
against malaria

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
or a defect in our genome?

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Well, I guess in some ways
it's a tradeoff; it's both.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000
SEVERSON:
The human genome is
rigged for survival

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
and thus, over time,
incorporates changes that help.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
But not all changes in
our genetic code defend us--

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
some are killers.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Medical researchers worldwide
want to find

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
the mutant disease genes
in all of us

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
and use them
to create therapies,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
and clues are the misspellings
in the genome.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
MAN:
If you're a geneticist

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
who is hunting for the genes
which underlie diseases,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
then what you are looking for

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
are places where
the genomes differ

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
between individuals
that have those diseases

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
and individuals that don't.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000
And so from that standpoint,
it's this fraction of the genome

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
that differs between individuals

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
that's actually
more interesting.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
SEVERSON:
Daly is a computational
biologist

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
at the Whitehead Institute
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
He uses statistical analysis
on human DNA

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
to find genetic signposts
pointing to disease.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000
There are nearly ten million
alternate spellings

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
among the genes
of the human genome:

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
some are good, others seem
to have little or no impact.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Still other misspellings
are like smoking guns,

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
pointing to disease.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
What I'm showing here you
is the result

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
of sequencing a short region
of chromosome five.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
We find a "G" at this
certain position here,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
and the other two-thirds
of the time,

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
we'd find a "C"
at this position here.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
But what it turns out to be...

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000
the case is that individuals
carrying the "G" at this spot

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
are maybe two to three times
more likely

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
to develop Crohn's disease
over the course of their life

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
than individuals who are just
carrying "C" at that location.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000
SEVERSON:
In the movies, mutants
are tall stories, unreal.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
But inside us, gene mutations
can create monsters

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000
that are all too real.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Todd Golub researches
genetic mutations

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
that create malignant monsters.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
The monster isn't 50 feet tall,

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
it's the size of a single
microscopic cell

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
that has gone berserk.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
In the early days of thinking
about the genetics of cancer,

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000
it was
a one-mutation-one-cancer model

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
where people thought that it
would only take one mutation

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
to cause a tumor.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
It's now quite clear
that's not the case,

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
that it's more likely that it
would require several mutations,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
the exact number
still not being clear.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
We know that when we look at the
genetic pattern of cancer cells

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
and compare them to the genetic
patterns of normal cells

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000
there are a huge
number of differences

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
at the genetic level,
maybe thousands of genes.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Only a small number of those--
perhaps a couple--

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000
are actually choke points for
the development of that cancer.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
SEVERSON:
Worldwide, researchers
are looking for mutant genes

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
at places like the Sanger Center

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
in England, just south
of the other Cambridge.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000
They want to know all
the misspellings and mutations

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000
that promote cancer
and why they occur.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Exposure to chemical carcinogens
will cause mutations.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Exposure to damaging UV
radiation will cause mutations.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Defects
in just general DNA repair...

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
I mean, to be able to replicate

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
the entire
three billion base pairs of DNA

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
accurately every time
is a huge task

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
and sometimes mistakes are made

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
and that's the genesis
of what causes cancer.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Cells normally
behave quite nicely.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000
They grow when they should

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
and they don't grow
when they shouldn't

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
and they grow where they should
and not where they shouldn't.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Cancer breaks all those rules:

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Cancer cells grow
inappropriately.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
They move throughout the body
and grow where they shouldn't.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
And understanding what
at the genetic level

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
is driving those processes,

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
why cancer cells evade
the immune system,

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
why they can grow in the liver,

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
why they can grow in the brain
when they shouldn't be there--

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
I mean, understanding
the basis of that,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
again, sort of builds
this knowledge base,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
and, sort of, this notion
of knowledge being power...

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
the more knowledge
we have about cancer

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
the more power we have
to control it.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
SEVERSON:
When the human genome
was sequenced,

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
it was, in effect,
a genetic snapshot,

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
a freeze-frame captured
at a point in human evolution.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000
The question is: What will
the human genome look like

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
ten thousand years from now?

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
If history is any indicator,
it will depend entirely

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
on what kind of a world
we will be living in.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
ALTSHULER:
I think the human genome

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
is a changing, fluid,
dynamic entity

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
spread across 12 billion copies,

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
carried all over the world
by different people.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
It carries variability

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
that was handed down
through the generations

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000
from shared ancestors
who lived in Africa.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
New mutations occur,
new changes occur

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000
every generation
when the DNA is copied

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
and potentially
in every cell of our body.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
And how those DNA changes--
the ones we inherited in common

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
and the new ones that occur
in our bodies--

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
interact with the environment
in which we live

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
and its changing characteristics
is a wonderful dance.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Some people like their kicks to
be fast and frequent.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
They are the thrill seekers
who are easily bored.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Whether they get their jollies

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
from drugs, sex
or extreme sports,

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
the basic need
is the same: excitement.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
But is this personality trait
something we learn,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000
or are its roots somewhere
deeper, in our genes?

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000
One or a zero,
they both have the same thing.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
One factorial is one,
zero factorial is zero, so...

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
SEVERSON:
Meet Doug Oberle.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
By the way, if at anytime
you can't see the overhead...

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
SEVERSON:
Born in Washington, DC,

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Doug is a 32-year-old
high school math teacher

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000
in Alexandria, Virginia.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
OBERLE:
...in on our own logic,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
getting to a terminating case
and spiraling out.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
SEVERSON:
As careers go,
this is pretty safe.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Today's lesson...

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
What I'd like to do today
is spiral logic.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Spiral logic
is referred to as recursion.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
SEVERSON:
Outside the classroom,

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Oberle's favorite pastime
gives new meaning

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
to the term "spiral logic."

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
After a 40-hour work week

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000
teaching teenagers
the finer points of math,

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
he says good-bye
to the grounded world

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000
and spends most of his weekends

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
leaping out of airplanes
with his buddies.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
OBERLE:
I actually get more response
of shock from people learning

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
that I am a math teacher,
as opposed to a sky diver.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
I'm the black sheep
in the family,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
referred to as
the freak of the family.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
SEVERSON:
Doug favors free flying,

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
a form of skydiving where
the jumpers reach speeds

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
in excess of 200 miles an hour
as they head toward earth.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
And he's jumped
nearly 1,400 times.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000
He is what you might call a
"risk taker," a thrill seeker.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
OBERLE:
I feel like I belong
in free fall.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000
The sensation of free fall,
being cushioned by air,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
just the sensation of not having
anything under you,

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
just felt like a place
where I belonged.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
I get something I refer
to as "ground sickness."

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
I get agitated,
I can't concentrate as well.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000
If I miss that on
a particular weekend

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
I don't feel right,
I feel off balance.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
SEVERSON:
What makes Doug

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
so exhilarated by--
even addicted to-- skydiving?

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
The typical person
is terrified by the idea

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
of jumping out of planes,
or similar high-risk hobbies.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
There just might be
a genetic explanation

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
for folks like Doug,

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
at least that's what
this man is looking for.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Risk takers happen to have...

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000
RESEARCHER:
When they do this kind
of risk-taking behavior

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000
they feel normal,
they feel, like, alive.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
They feel like you and I,

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000
but when they're not doing that,
they're down,

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000
you know, life has no pleasure,
has no meaning,

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
you know,
"I'm not enjoying myself."

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
Dr. Noble reasons that thrill
seekers need their thrills

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
because their brains
work differently.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
He has been researching
how certain genetic mutations

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
are related to the brain's use
of a chemical called dopamine.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000
COMPUTER:
About Dopamine:

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
a chemical messenger
nerve cells use

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
to communicate with each other.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000
When humans are satisfied

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000
after an especially
enjoyable experience,

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000
the brain is awash in dopamine
and thus they feel good.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Noble's research indicates

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
that those born
with a genetic mutation

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000
of the DRD2 or DRD4 gene
on chromosome 11

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
have fewer dopamine receptors.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000
As a population, these
individuals typically need

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
to experience more excitement

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.000
to achieve
the same sensations of pleasure.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000
SEVERSON:
According to Dr. Noble,
as many as 30% of humans

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000
are born with a shortage
of dopamine receptors.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Are these people
more likely to become

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000
risk takers like Doug Oberle?

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.000
Could that explain other kinds
of risky business

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000
like gambling, drinking
too much, or using drugs?

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000
NOBLE:
Almost all of us
take some risks.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
When you get in the car
and drive on the highway

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
in a way,
you're taking a risk, right?

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000
But there are those who,
when they get to the highway,

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000
are always driving very fast,
taking great risks,

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000
cutting corners, et cetera.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000
SEVERSON:
Which leads to another question:

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000
If risk takers are more likely
to do dangerous things,

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000
why do those genes show up so
often in the population today?

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Why haven't
the risk takers died out?

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000
NOBLE:
I think we take risks
because in doing so

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000
we get excitement
or a thrill or a challenge.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
The other reason
why we may take risks

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000
is because in taking those risks
we accomplish great tasks,

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000
do great things
like, uh, poetry,

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000
like novels,
like music, et cetera.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000
( playing Mozart sonata )

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000
SEVERSON:
Dr. Noble wants us to think
of our genetic inheritance

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000
as just a part
of what makes us what we are.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000
( sonata continuing )

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000
NOBLE:
When somebody sits down
and plays at the piano,

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000
the strings of the piano
are like your DNA.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
You can make the tone louder,

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000
you can make it softer,
smoother, et cetera.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000
And you need the two to give you
the balance of life.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000
And that's what results
in your personality.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.000
SEVERSON:
In his metaphor, the strings
of the piano are our genes.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000
The impact of our environment

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000
is represented by the pedals
controlling how the notes sound,

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000
but the third factor is
the pianist's personal style.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000
NOBLE:
The emotion that person puts in,

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
that finally results
in you sitting as an audience

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
and listening to this person,

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000
see how beautifully
that person plays.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000
SEVERSON:
It's this concert
of genes and environment

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000
that separates those
who are elated by Mozart

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000
and those who go to greater
lengths, or heights,

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000
to collect their thrills.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
OBERLE:
The sky diver in me

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000
does not want to consider
skydiving as risk taking.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000
But I think that in taking risks
you feel more alive.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000
That if just going
through life conservatively,

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.000
and, you know,
you don't experience

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000
a wide range of emotions,
that there's, uh...

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
you know,
it's stagnant, it's static.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Whereas opposed to risk-taking
in a general sense

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000
you know, it creates a more
fulfilling, dynamic experience.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
It's obvious that
some people

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000
are just naturally better
at sports than others.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000
They can run faster or farther
or develop bigger muscles.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Why?

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Well, that and a lot else is
determined by our metabolism--

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
things like breathing,
heart rate, blood flow.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000
And our metabolism
is determined by our genes,

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.000
including two variants of
a very important gene named ACE.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000
I'm sure the computer
would love to tell us about it.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:47.000
COMPUTER:
Well, Lucky, ACE stands for
angiotensin-converting enzyme,

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
a key element
of the circulation system

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
that dictates blood pressure.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Human beings have two ACE genes,
one inherited from each parent.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Each of these has variants
labeled I or D.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.000
There are three
possible combinations.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.000
The I variant makes less ACE,
the D variant makes more.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.000
DDs tend to have higher
blood pressure, IIs lower.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000
For most people, high
blood pressure is undesirable.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000
It is associated with
heart disease and stroke.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000
So, is there
an evolutionary reason

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000
that some produce higher levels
of ACE than others?

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000
COMPUTER:
Good question.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000
There may have been
an adaptive advantage

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
to having high levels of ACE.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
If you were unfortunate enough

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000
to have had a leg bitten off
by a saber-toothed tiger

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
or experienced hemorrhage
in childbirth,

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000
the increased blood pressure
of high-ACE-level individuals

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
would help them survive.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000
SEVERSON:
The relationship
between ACE and blood pressure

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000
has been known for some time.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
A family of drugs
called ACE inhibitors

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000
have proved successful in
controlling high blood pressure

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000
by lowering the levels
of ACE in the body.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000
To a doctor
at London's University College,

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000
those results suggest that
something else is going on, too.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.000
MAN:
The death rates were at least
halved by the ACE inhibitors,

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000
so they were doing
something else magical,

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000
and no one at that stage
knew what that was.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000
SEVERSON:
Hugh Montgomery's lab is devoted

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.000
to exploring the genes that
affect the heart and its growth.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000
MONTGOMERY:
Heart growth itself
in disease states

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000
is almost universally
a bad thing.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.000
And the bigger the heart gets,
the more likely you are to die.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Part of that is explicable
by the fact

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000
that you've just got
an awful lot more heart muscle

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
and it gets a lot of
collagen, or scarring,

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
between the muscle cells

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
and it seems just to function
less well over time.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:53.000
What we can see here is
a cardiac MRI of a normal heart.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000
SEVERSON:
The right ventricle pumps
blood to the lungs,

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000
but the left ventricle,
shown here as this dark ring,

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000
has to do all the work

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000
of supplying blood
to the rest of the body.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000
The left ventricle here
is of normal thickness.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
The MRI of
a thickened heart shows

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
just how much more
work it has to do

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
to keep the circulation going.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:18.000
You can see, although the heart
looks relatively smaller here,

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000
this wall of the left ventricle

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000
is definitely thicker
and is making the cavity,

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000
which is full of fluid,
actually look smaller.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000
if you have a thicker heart
muscle, more heart growth,

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000
you are much more likely to have
a heart attack,

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000
or to get peripheral
vascular disease,

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000
or kidney failure or
to have a stroke.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000
And we don't know what's
connecting those two things.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000
If we can find out what
makes hearts grow,

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
then we can find out
perhaps what's also

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000
causing strokes and
heart attacks.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Animal studies suggested
that the ace gene

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
had something to do with
heart growth.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000
But when it came time to do
human studies,

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
the options
were limited.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000
The only way in which one could
do that was to use the ace gene

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000
as a measure of differences of
ace activity in heart muscle

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000
because you can't otherwise
measure in a human.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000
You can't go around taking
pieces of heart muscle out.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
But there was another way to
approach it.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000
The heart is a muscle and
muscles grow with exercise.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000
What if we could measure
the effects of exercise on

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000
heart size and
match that against

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
their ace gene
expression.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Then we'd know whether ace
affects heart growth.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000
Enter the British Army.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.000
New army recruits were
the perfect control

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000
sample for this
experiment.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
They're all roughly
the same age

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000
and during their
basic training they live a

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:47.000
highly regulated,
identical lifestyle.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000
Over twelve weeks the recruits
were put through paces

00:57:50.000 --> 00:58:02.000
with a combination of strength
and endurance training.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Samples of DNA were
taken from the recruits

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
and sent to the
lab at London.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
In the meantime the
young soldiers

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
continued their
training.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Their heart and skeletal muscle
mass was measured periodically.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
At first the results simply
seamed to confirm

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000
what the researchers were
expecting to find.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Well the first thing
that we identified

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:27.000
was that we found that the two
D versions of the ace gene,

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000
high ace activity was
associated with much greater

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
heart growth with
exercise.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.000
The two I versions of the ace
gene, low ace activity

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000
associated with much
less heart growth.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
So the study demonstrated
that levels of ace

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000
did indeed control
heart growth.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000
The recruits with higher levels
of ace built up bigger muscles

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
including their
heart muscles.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000
But the surprising finding was
that those with low ace levels

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:54.000
developed much
better stamina.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.000
At the end of training we found
very dramatic effects.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
The iis, the low ace
activity people

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
had doubled their
duration exercise.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
And the poor old
DDs actually were

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000
no better off at the
end of ten weeks

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.000
of military training then they
were at the start.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.000
So low ace activity made your
muscles more fatigue resistant.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
And these were big
findings if you view

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
the heart as the ultimate
endurance muscle.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000
It's got to beat maybe
100 times a minute

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000
for lets say
hopefully 105 years.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Not altogether
surprising therefore

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
that perhaps low ace
activity is beneficial

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000
to heart as an
endurance muscle.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
And we began to wonder
whether in fact

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
if that's what ace
inhibitors were doing.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000
They were helping this endurance
characteristic of the muscle.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Part of the recruits
training program involves

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000
running 1 1/2 miles
at maximum speed

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.000
at the start of the twelve weeks
training and again at the end.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.000
Once again the recruits with
low ace activity developed

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000
greater endurance and
dramatically improved

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000
their run times.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000
That means the ace
gene is affecting

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.000
the entire
metabolic system.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
We can now see there
are large advantages

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
to low levels of ace activity.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
The ace gene variation will
partly explain peoples

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
response to exercise but
it's not "the gene"

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000
for exercise performance.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I think we are a long way off
that sort of genetic selection

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
of exercise training.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Much better in fact to say that
exercise is good for everybody

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
and aerobic training is
the best sort of exercise

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
and that we should
all do it.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
So don''t give up the gym
membership just yet.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
In the meantime we 'll
keep you updated on further

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000
research developments with
this two faced gene.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Genetics, confusing,
controversial

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
and always complicated.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000
But that's life.
