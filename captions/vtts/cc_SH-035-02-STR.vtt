00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.870


2
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.270
Was not CountJohn here at supper?

3
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.700
I saw him not.

4
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.830
How tartly thatgentleman looks!

5
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.970
I never can see him but I amheart-burned an hour after.

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.230
He is of a verymelancholy disposition.

7
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.870
He were an excellent manthat were made just

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.600
in the midway betweenhim and Benedick:

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.570
the one is too like animage and says nothing,

10
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.370
and the other too likemy lady's eldest son,

11
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.400
evermore tattling.

12
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.030
Then half SigniorBenedick's tongue

13
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.130
in Count John's mouth, andhalf Count John's melancholy

14
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.700
in Signior Benedick's face,--

15
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.400
With a good leg anda good foot, uncle,

16
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.630
and money enough in his purse,

17
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.570
such a man would win anywoman in the world,

18
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.170
if a' could gether good-will.

19
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.700
By my troth, niece, thou wiltnever get thee a husband,

20
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.470
if thou be so shrewdof thy tongue.

21
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.230
In faith, she's too curst.

22
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.330
Too curst is more than curst:

23
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.230
I shall lessen God's sendingthat way; for it is said,

24
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.100
'God sends a curstcow short horns;

25
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.830
but to a cow toocurst he sends none.

26
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.000
So, by being too curst, Godwill send you no horns.

27
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.130
Just, if he sendme no husband;

28
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.270
for the which blessing

29
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.530
I am at him upon my kneesevery morning and evening.

30
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.430
Lord, I could notendure a husband

31
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.300
with a beard on his face:

32
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.670
I had rather liein the woollen.

33
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.700
You may light on a husbandthat hath no beard.

34
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.300
What should I do with him?

35
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.400
dress him in my apparel and makehim my waiting-gentlewoman?

36
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.230
He that hath a beardis more than a youth,

37
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.400
and he that hath no beardis less than a man:

38
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.700
and he that is more thana youth is not for me,

39
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.700
and he that isless than a man,

40
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.570
I am not for him:

41
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.830
therefore, I willeven take sixpence

42
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.170
in earnest of the bear-ward,and lead his apes into hell.

43
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.530
Well, then, go you into hell?

44
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.300
No, but to the gate; and therewill the devil meet me,

45
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.370
like an old cuckold,with horns on his head,

46
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.530
and say 'Get you toheaven, Beatrice,

47
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.730
get you to heaven;

48
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.830
here's no place for you maids:'so deliver I up my apes,

49
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.600
and away to Saint Peterfor the heavens;

50
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.700
he shows me wherethe bachelors sit,

51
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.270
and there live we asmerry as the day is long.

52
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.370
Well, niece, I trust you willbe ruled by your father.

53
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.200
Yes, faith; it is my cousin'sduty to make curtsy

54
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.430
and say 'Father, asit please you.'

55
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.530
But yet for all that, cousin,let him be a handsome fellow,

56
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.430
or else make anothercurtsy and say 'Father,

57
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.400
as it please me.'

58
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.870
Well, niece, I hope to see youone day fitted with a husband.

59
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.530
Not till God make men of someother metal than earth.

60
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.200
Would it not grieve awoman to be overmastered

61
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.670
by a pierceof valiant dust?

62
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.830
to make an account of her lifeto a clod of wayward marl?

63
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.830
No, uncle, I'll none: Adam'ssons are my brethren;

64
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.870
and, truly, I hold it a sinto match in my kindred.

65
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.800
Daughter, rememberwhat I told you:

66
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.870
if the prince do solicityou in that kind,

67
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.600
you know your answer.

68
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.900
The fault will be inthe music, cousin,

69
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.900
if you be not wooedin good time:

70
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.800
if the prince be too important,tell him there is measure

71
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.300
in every thing and sodance out the answer.

72
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.770
For, hear me,Hero: wooing,

73
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.730
wedding, and repenting,is as a Scotch jig,

74
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.570
a measure, and a cinque pace:

75
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.400
the first suit is hot andhasty, like a Scotch jig,

76
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.070
and full asfantastical; the wedding,

77
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.330
mannerly-modest,as a measure,

78
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.830
full of stateand ancientry;

79
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.000
and then comes repentance

80
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.300
and, with his bad legs,falls into the cinque pace

81
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.570
faster and faster, tillhe sink into his grave.

82
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.430
Neice, you apprehendpassing shrewdly.

83
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.730
I have a good eye, uncle; Ican see a church by daylight.

84
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.170
The revellers areentering, brother:

85
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.600
make good room.

86
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.170
(â™ªmusic for dancing)

87
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.630
Lady, will you walkabout with your friend?

88
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.270
So you walk softly and looksweetly and say nothing,

89
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.470
I am yours for the walk;

90
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.530
especiallywhen I walk away.

91
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.870
With me in your company?

92
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.300
I may say so,when I please.

93
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.530
And when pleaseyou to say so?

94
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.270
When I like your favour;

95
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.300
for God defend the luteshould be like the case!

96
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.000
My visor isPhilemon's roof;

97
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.770
within the house is Jove.

98
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.400
Why, then, your visorshould be thatched.

99
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.430
Speak low, ifyou speak love.

100
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.130
Well, I wouldyou did like me.

101
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.730
So would not I,for your own sake;

102
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.770
for I have manyill-qualities.

103
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.030
Which is one?

104
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.430
I say my prayers aloud.

105
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.670
I love you the better: thehearers may cry, Amen.

106
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.030
God match mewith a good dancer!

107
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.700
Amen.

108
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.400
And God take him out of mysight when the dance is done!

109
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.670
Answer, clerk.

110
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.500
No more words: theclerk is answered.

111
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.370
I know you well enough;you are Signior Antonio.

112
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.600
At a word, I am not.

113
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.000
I know you by thewaggling of your head.

114
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.400
To tell you true,I counterfeit him.

115
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.200
You could never dohim so ill-well,

116
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.730
unless you werethe very man.

117
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.470
Here's his dry hand up anddown: you are he, you are he.

118
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.270
At a word, I am not.

119
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.030
Will you not tellme who told you so?

120
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.130
No, you shall pardon me.

121
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.630
Nor will you nottell me who you are?

122
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.600
Not now.

123
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.930
That I was disdainful,

124
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.970
and that I had my good wit outof the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'

125
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.470
--well this was SigniorBenedick that said so.

126
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.530
What's he?

127
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.900
I am sure you knowhim well enough.

128
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:26.830
Not I, believe me.

129
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.330
Did he nevermake you laugh?

130
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.900
I pray you, what is he?

131
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.230
Why, he is the prince'sjester: a very dull fool;

132
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.430
only his gift is in devisingimpossible slanders:

133
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.670
none but libertinesdelight in him;

134
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.030
and the commendationis not in his wit,

135
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.000
but in his villany; forhe both pleases men

136
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.700
and angers them, and then theylaugh at him and beat him.

137
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.030
I am sure he is in the fleet:I would he had boarded me.

138
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.470
When I know the gentleman,I'll tell him what you say.

139
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.570
Do, do: he'll but break acomparison or two on me;

140
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.400
which, peradventure notmarked or not laughed at,

141
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.130
strikes himinto melancholy;

142
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.900
and then there's apartridge wing saved,

143
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.070
for the fool will eatno supper that night.

144
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.730
We mustfollow the leaders.

145
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.830
In every good thing.

146
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.330
Nay, if theylead to any ill,

147
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.900
I will leave themat the next turning.

148
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.770
Sure my brother isamorous on Hero

149
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.170
and hath withdrawn her fatherto break with him about it.

150
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.800
The ladies follow herand but one visor remains.

151
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.330
And that is Claudio: Iknow him by his bearing.

152
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.900
Are not youSignior Benedick?

153
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.570
You know me well; I am he.

154
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.730
Signior, you are very nearmy brother in his love:

155
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.870
he is enamoured on Hero;

156
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.770
I pray you, dissuadehim from her:

157
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.500
she is no equal for his birth:

158
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.100
you may do the part ofan honest man in it.

159
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.330
How know you he loves her?

160
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.770
I heard himswear his affection.

161
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:44.500
So did I too; and he swore hewould marry her to-night.

162
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.370
Come, let usto the banquet.

163
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.270
Thus answer I inthe name of Benedick,

164
00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:04.400
But hear these ill newswith the ears of Claudio.

165
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.000
'Tis certain so; theprince wooes for himself.

166
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.070
Friendship is constantin all other things

167
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.130
Save in the officeand affairs of love:

168
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.400
Therefore, all hearts inlove use their own tongues;

169
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.600
Let every eyenegotiate for itself

170
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.800
And trust no agent;for beauty is a witch

171
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.770
Against whose charms faithmelteth into blood.

172
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.300
This is anaccident of hourly proof,

173
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.070
Which I mistrusted not.

174
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.470
Farewell, therefore, Hero!

175
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.170
Count Claudio?

176
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.230
Yea, the same.

177
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.130
Come, will you go with me?

178
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.330
Whither?

179
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:49.600
Even to the next willow, aboutyour own business, county.

180
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.930
What fashion will youwear the garland of?

181
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.700
about your neck,like an usurer's chain?

182
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.230
or under your arm, likea lieutenant's scarf?

183
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.270
You must wear it one way, forthe prince hath got your Hero.

184
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.430
I wish him joy of her.

185
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.230
Why, that's spoken likean honest drovier:

186
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.270
so they sell bullocks.

187
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.230
But did you think the princewould have served you thus?

188
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:10.330
I pray you, leave me.

189
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.830
Ho! now you strikelike the blind man:

190
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.200
'twas the boy thatstole your meat,

191
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.800
and you'll beat the post.

192
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.200
If it will notbe, I'll leave you.

193
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.800
Alas, poor hurt fowl!

194
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.770
now will hecreep into sedges.

195
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.230
But that my LadyBeatrice should know me,

196
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.370
and not know me!

197
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.130
The prince's fool!

198
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.470
Ha?

199
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.330
It may be I go under thattitle because I am merry.

200
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.130
Yea, but so I am aptto do myself wrong;

201
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.370
I am not so reputed:

202
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.000
it is the base, though bitter,disposition of Beatrice

203
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
that puts the world into herperson and so gives me out.

204
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.670
Well, I'll berevenged as I may.

205
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.330
Now, signior,where's the count?

206
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.270
did you see him?

207
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.170
I found him here as melancholyas a lodge in a warren:

208
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.870
I told him, and I thinkI told him true,

209
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.900
that your grace had got thegood will of this young lady;

210
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.770
and I offered him mycompany to a willow-tree,

211
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.130
either to make him a garland,

212
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.400
as being forsaken, orto bind him up a rod,

213
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.970
as being worthyto be whipped.

214
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.100
To be whipped!

215
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.000
What's his fault?

216
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.370
The flat transgressionof a schoolboy,

217
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.970
who, being overjoyed withfinding a birds' nest,

218
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.300
shows it his companion,and he steals it.

219
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.630
Wilt thou make atrust a transgression?

220
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:30.900
The transgressionis in the stealer.

221
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.730
Yet it had not been amissthe rod had been made,

222
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.670
and the garland too;

223
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.900
for the garland he mighthave worn himself,

224
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.900
and the rod he mighthave bestowed on you,

225
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.830
who, as I take it, havestolen his birds' nest.

226
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.500
I will butteach them to sing,

227
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.870
and restorethem to the owner.

228
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.670
If their singinganswer your saying,

229
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:54.700
by my faith,you say honestly.

230
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.600
The Lady Beatrice hatha quarrel to you:

231
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.430
the gentleman thatdanced with her

232
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:06.500
told her she is muchwronged by you.

233
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:13.130
O, she misused me pastthe endurance of a block!

234
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.900
an oak but with one green leafon it would have answered her;

235
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:20.800
my very visor began to assumelife and scold with her.

236
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.100
She told me, not thinkingI had been myself,

237
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.070
that I was theprince's jester,

238
00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.570
that I was dullerthan a great thaw;

239
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.900
huddling jest uponjest with such impossible

240
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.200
conveyance upon me that Istood like a man at a mark,

241
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.130
with a whole armyshooting at me.

242
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:40.170
She speaks poniards,and every word stabs:

243
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.770
if her breath were as terribleas her terminations,

244
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.970
there were noliving near her;

245
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.930
she would infectto the north star.

246
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.170
I would not marry her,though she were endowed

247
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.970
with all that Adam bad lefthim before he transgressed:

248
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.100
Come, talk not of her:

249
00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.370
you shall find her theinfernal Ate in good apparel.

250
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.900
I would to God somescholar would conjure her;

251
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.670
for certainly,while she is here,

252
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.070
a man may live as quietin hell as in a sanctuary;

253
00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.630
and people sinupon purpose,

254
00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.330
because theywould go thither;

255
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.230
so, indeed, all disquiet, horrorand perturbation follows her.

256
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.230
Look, here she comes.

257
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:25.670
Will your grace command me anyservice to the world's end?

258
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.370
I will go on theslightest errand now

259
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.070
to the Antipodes that youcan devise to send me on;

260
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.200
I will fetch you atooth-picker now

261
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.070
from the furthest inchof Asia,

262
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:37.470
bring you the length ofPrester John's foot,

263
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.500
fetch you a hair off thegreat Cham's beard,

264
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.870
do you any embassageto the Pigmies,

265
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:46.130
rather than hold three words'conference with this harpy.

266
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.370
You have noemployment for me?

267
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:53.070
None, but to desireyour good company.

268
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:03.770
O God, sir, here'sa dish I love not:

269
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:07.500
I cannot endure myLady Tongue.

270
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.030
Come, lady, come; you have lostthe heart of Signior Benedick.

271
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:24.330
Indeed, my lord, helent it me awhile;

272
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.300
and I gave him usefor it,

273
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.830
a double heart forhis single one:

274
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:33.000
marry, once before he wonit of me with false dice,

275
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.130
therefore your grace maywell say I have lost it.

276
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.770
You have puthim down, lady,

277
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:38.830
you have put him down.

278
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.230
So I would nothe should do me,

279
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.700
my lord, lest I shouldprove the mother of fools.

280
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.100
I have broughtCount Claudio,

281
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.570
whom you sent meto seek.

282
00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.000
Why, how now, count!

283
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.200
wherefore are you sad?

284
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.970
Not sad, my lord.

285
00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.400
How then? sick?

286
00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.930
Neither, my lord.

287
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.030
The count isneither sad, nor sick,

288
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:07.570
nor merry, nor well; but civilcount, civil as an orange,

289
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.370
and something of thatjealous complexion.

290
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.300
I' faith, lady, I thinkyour blazon to be true;

291
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.470
though, I'll besworn, if he be so,

292
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:19.000
his conceit is false.

293
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.570
Here, Claudio, Ihave wooed in thy name,

294
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:28.330
and fair Hero is won: I havebroke with her father,

295
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:32.900
and his good will obtained:name the day of marriage,

296
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.730
and God give thee joy!

297
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.100
Count, take ofme my daughter,

298
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.700
and with her my fortunes: hisgrace hath made the match,

299
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.900
and an grace say Amen to it.

300
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.500
Speak, count,'tis your cue.

301
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:53.800
Silence is the perfectestherald of joy:

302
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.870
I were but little happy,if I could say how much.

303
00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:04.270
Lady, as you aremine, I am yours:

304
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:11.400
I give away myself for youand dote upon the exchange.

305
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.400
Speak, cousin;or, if you cannot,

306
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.270
stop his mouthwith a kiss,

307
00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.000
and let not himspeak neither.

308
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.370
In faith, lady, youhave a merry heart.

309
00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.870
Yea, my lord; Ithank it, poor fool,

310
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.900
it keeps on thewindy side of care.

311
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:31.370
My cousin tells him in hisear that he is in her heart.

312
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.400
And so she doth, cousin.

313
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.300
Good Lord, for alliance!

314
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.600
Thus goes every oneto the world but I,

315
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.170
I may sit in a corner andcry heigh-ho for a husband!

316
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.030
Lady Beatrice, Iwill get you one.

317
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.400
I would rather have oneof your father's getting.

318
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.730
Hath your grace ne'era brother like you?

319
00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.000
Your father gotexcellent husbands,

320
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.830
if a maid couldcome by them.

321
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.670
Will you have me, lady?

322
00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:00.930
No, my lord, unless I mighthave another for working-days:

323
00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:04.770
your grace is too costlyto wear every day.

324
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.870
But, I beseech yourgrace, pardon me:

325
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:11.130
I was born to speak allmirth and no matter.

326
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.930
Your silencemost offends me,

327
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.330
and to be merrybest becomes you;

328
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.970
for, out of question, youwere born in a merry hour.

329
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:22.170
No, sure, my lord,my mother cried;

330
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.430
but then therewas a star danced,

331
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.600
and under that was I born.

332
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.000
Cousins, God give you joy!

333
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:35.570
Niece, will you look tothose things I told you of?

334
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.530
I cry you mercy, uncle.

335
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:41.500
By your grace's pardon.

336
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.570
By my troth, apleasant-spirited lady.

337
00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.900
There's little of the melancholyelement in her, my lord:

338
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.730
she is never sad butwhen she sleeps,

339
00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:58.030
and not ever sad then; for Ihave heard my daughter say,

340
00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.530
she hath often dreamedof unhappiness

341
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:01.530
and waked herselfwith laughing.

342
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.400
She cannot endure tohear tell of a husband.

343
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.400
O, by no means: she mocksall her wooers out of suit.

344
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.130
She were an excellentwife for Benedict.

345
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:14.200
O Lord, my lord, if theywere but a week married,

346
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.000
they would talkthemselves mad.

347
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.500
County Claudio, whenmean you to go to church?

348
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.000
To-morrow, my lord:time goes on crutches

349
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.470
till love have all his rites.

350
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:26.430
Not tillMonday, my dear son,

351
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.070
which is hence ajust seven-night;

352
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:33.130
and a time too brief, too, tohave all things answer my mind.

353
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.230
Come, you shake the headat so long a breathing:

354
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.930
but, I warrantthee, Claudio,

355
00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:41.100
the time shallnot go dully by us.

356
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:45.930
I will in the interim undertakeone of Hercules' labours;

357
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.930
which is, to bring SigniorBenedick and the Lady Beatrice

358
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.500
into a mountain of affectionthe one with the other.

359
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.770
I would fainhave it a match,

360
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.600
and I doubt notbut to fashion it,

361
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.070
if you three will butminister such assistance

362
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.670
as I shall giveyou direction.

363
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.970
My lord, I am for you, though itcost me ten nights' watchings.

364
00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.000
And I, my lord.

365
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.900
And you too, gentle Hero?

366
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.930
I will do anymodest office,

367
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:11.430
my lord, to help mycousin to a good husband.

368
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.430
And Benedick is not theunhopefullest husband

369
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.600
that I know.

370
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:20.530
Thus far can I praise him;he is of a noble strain,

371
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.330
of approved valourand confirmed honesty.

372
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.530
I will teach you howto humour your cousin,

373
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.400
that she shall fallin love with Benedick;

374
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.070
and I, withyour two helps,

375
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.600
will so practiseon Benedick that,

376
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.300
in despite of his quick witand his queasy stomach,

377
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.370
he shall fall inlove with Beatrice.

378
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:42.830
If we can do this, Cupidis no longer an archer:

379
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:47.800
his glory shall be ours, forwe are the only love-gods.

380
00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.970
Go in with me, and Iwill tell you my drift.

381
00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.500
It is so;

382
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.370
the Count Claudio shall marrythe daughter of Leonato.

383
00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.930
Yea, my lord; butI can cross it.

384
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.900
Any bar, any cross,

385
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.530
any impediment will bemedicinable to me:

386
00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.130
I am sick indispleasure to him,

387
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.970
and whatsoever comesathwart his affection

388
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.830
ranges evenly with mine.

389
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.470
How canst thou crossthis marriage?

390
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.170
Not honestly, my lord;

391
00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.730
but so covertly that nodishonesty shall appear in me.

392
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.070
Show me briefly how.

393
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.730
I think I told yourlordship a year since,

394
00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.100
how much I am in thefavour of Margaret,

395
00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.170
the waitinggentlewoman to Hero.

396
00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.230
I remember.

397
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.800
I can, at any unseasonableinstant of the night,

398
00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.500
appoint her to look out ather lady's chamber window.

399
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.630
What life is in that, to bethe death of this marriage?

400
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.830
The poison of thatlies in you to temper.

401
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.970
Go you to theprince your brother;

402
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.100
spare not to tell him thathe hath wronged his honour

403
00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.470
in marrying therenowned Claudio

404
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.600
--whose estimation doyou mightily hold up--

405
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.900
to a contaminated stale,such a one as Hero.

406
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.730
What proof shallI make of that?

407
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.370
Proof enough tomisuse the prince,

408
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:15.300
to vex Claudio, to undoHero and kill Leonato.

409
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.730
Look you forany other issue?

410
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.970
Only to despite them, Iwill endeavour any thing.

411
00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.670
Go, then; find me a meethour to draw Don Pedro

412
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.770
and the CountClaudio alone:

413
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.370
tell them that you knowthat Hero loves me;

414
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.100
intend a kind of zeal bothto the prince and Claudio,

415
00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.900
as, -in love of yourbrother's honour,

416
00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.270
who hath made this match, andhis friend's reputation,

417
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:43.430
who is thus like to be cozenedwith the semblance of a maid,

418
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:44.870
-that you havediscovered thus.

419
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:48.900
They will scarcely believethis without trial:

420
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.770
offer them instances; whichshall bear no less likelihood

421
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.630
than to see me ather chamber-window,

422
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:58.730
hear me callMargaret Hero,

423
00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.530
hear Margaretterm me Borachio;

424
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.100
and bring themto see this

425
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.000
the very night beforethe intended wedding,

426
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.800
--for in the meantime Iwill so fashion the matter

427
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.430
that Hero shall be absent,

428
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.400
-and there shall appear

429
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.300
such seeming truth ofHero's disloyalty

430
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.670
that jealousy shallbe called assurance

431
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:21.330
and all the preparationoverthrown.

432
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:25.100
Grow this to whatadverse issue it can,

433
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.330
I will put it in practise.

434
00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.430
Be cunning inthe working this,

435
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:33.130
and thy fee is athousand ducats.

436
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.300
Be you constantin the accusation,

437
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.670
and my cunningshall not shame me.

438
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:45.430
I will presently go learntheir day of marriage.

439
00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:57.870
(â™ªsong)

440
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:36.870
Boy!

441
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:38.200
Signior?

442
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.000
In my chamber-windowlies a book:

443
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.230
bring it hither tome in the orchard.

444
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.630
I am here already, sir.

445
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.700
I know that; but Iwould have thee hence,

446
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.030
and here again.

447
00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.700
I do muchwonder that one man,

448
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.700
seeing how muchanother man is a fool

449
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.000
when he dedicates hisbehaviors to love,

450
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.030
will, after hehath laughed

451
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:12.070
at such shallowfollies in others,

452
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:16.700
become the argument of his ownscorn by falling in love:

453
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.270
and such a man is Claudio.

454
00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:22.470
I have known when therewas no music with him

455
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.130
but the drum and the fife;

456
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:28.100
and now had he rather hearthe tabour and the pipe:

457
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.870
I have known when he wouldhave walked ten mile a-foot

458
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:33.500
to see a good armour;

459
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.700
and now will he lieten nights awake,

460
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.730
carving the fashionof a new doublet.

461
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:41.530
He was wont to speakplain and to the purpose,

462
00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.100
like an honestman and a soldier;

463
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.730
and now is heturned orthography;

464
00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:50.570
his words are a veryfantastical banquet,

465
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:56.100
just so manystrange dishes.

466
00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.970
May I be so convertedand see with these eyes?

467
00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:06.000
I cannot tell; I thinknot: I will not be sworn,

468
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.130
but love maytransform me to an oyster;

469
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:09.730
but I'll takemy oath on it,

470
00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:11.600
till he have madean oyster of me,

471
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.200
he shall nevermake me such a fool.

472
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:19.770
One woman isfair, yet I am well;

473
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:21.330
another is wise,yet I am well;

474
00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:25.800
anothervirtuous, yet I am well;

475
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.030
but till allgraces be in one woman,

476
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.800
one woman shall notcome in my grace.

477
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.970
Rich she shallbe, that's certain;

478
00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:37.170
wise, or I'llnone; virtuous,

479
00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.870
or I'll nevercheapen her; fair,

480
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.770
or I'll neverlook on her; mild,

481
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:42.870
or come not near me;

482
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:48.000
noble, or not I for anangel; of good discourse,

483
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.070
an excellent musician,and her hair

484
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:57.670
shall be of whatcolour it please God.

485
00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:58.770
Ha!

486
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.370
the prince andMonsieur Love!

487
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.630
I will hide mein the arbour.

488
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:10.530
Come, shall wehear this music?

489
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.300
Yea, my good lord.

490
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.830
How still the evening is,As hush'd on purpose

491
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.930
to grace harmony!

492
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.900
See you whereBenedick hath hid himself?

493
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.530
O, very well, mylord: the music ended,

494
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.300
We'll fit thekid-fox with a pennyworth.

495
00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:32.500
Come, Balthasar, we'llhear that song again.

496
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.530
O, good my lord, taxnot so bad a voice

497
00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.230
To slander music anymore than once.

498
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.170
It is the witnessstill of excellency

499
00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:42.600
To put a strange faceon his own perfection.

500
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.300
I pray thee, sing,and let me woo no more.

501
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:51.670
Note, notes,forsooth, and nothing.

502
00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:02.300
Now, divine air!

503
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.100
now is his soul ravished!

504
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.300
Is it not strange that sheeps'guts should hale souls

505
00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.600
out of men's bodies?

506
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:14.830
Well, a horn for mymoney, when all's done.

507
00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:16.930
(â™ªsinging) Men weredeceivers ever,

508
00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:21.800
foot in sea and one on shore,To one thing constant never:

509
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:26.730
Then sigh not so,but let them go,

510
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:31.800
And be you blithe and bonny,

511
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:43.030
Converting all your sounds ofwoe Into Hey nonny, nonny.

512
00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:49.270
Sing no moreditties, sing no moe,

513
00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:55.100
Of dumps sodull and heavy;

514
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:59.300
The fraud ofmen was ever so,

515
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:04.900
Since summer first was leafy:

516
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:15.230
Then sigh not so, And beyou blithe and bonny,

517
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:25.270
Converting all your sounds ofwoe Into Hey nonny, nonny.

518
00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:32.070
Converting all your sounds ofwoe Into Hey nonny, nonny.

519
00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.900
By my troth, a good song.

520
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.330
And an illsinger, my lord.

521
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:42.900
Ha, no, no, faith; thou singestwell enough for a shift.

522
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.530
An he had been a dog thatshould have howled thus,

523
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.230
they would have hangedhim: and I pray God

524
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.430
his bad voicebode no mischief.

525
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.700
I had as lief haveheard the night-raven,

526
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.800
come what plaguecould have come after it.

527
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.800
Yea, marry, dost thouhear, Balthasar?

528
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.770
I pray thee, get ussome excellent music;

529
00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:02.500
for to-morrow nightwe would have it

530
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.100
at the Lady Hero'schamber-window.

531
00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.700
The best I can, my lord.

532
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.230
Do so: farewell.

533
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.500
Come hither, Leonato.

534
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.730
What was it youtold me of to-day,

535
00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:22.530
that your niece Beatrice was inlove with Signior Benedick?

536
00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.100
O, ay:

537
00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.370
stalk on. stalk on;the fowl sits.

538
00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:29.730
I did never think that ladywould have loved any man.

539
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:32.900
No, nor I neither;but most wonderful

540
00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.970
that she should so doteon Signior Benedick,

541
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:39.470
whom she hath in all outwardbehaviors seemed ever to abhor.

542
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:41.100
Is't possible?

543
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.200
Sits the windin that corner?

544
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.500
By my troth, my lord, I cannottell what to think of it

545
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.870
but that she loves him withan enraged affection:

546
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.130
it is past theinfinite of thought.

547
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.630
May be she dothbut counterfeit.

548
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.100
Faith, like enough.

549
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.270
O God, counterfeit!

550
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.030
There was nevercounterfeit of passion

551
00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.500
came so near the life ofpassion as she discovers it.

552
00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.500
Why, what effects ofpassion shows she?

553
00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.670
Bait the hook well;this fish will bite.

554
00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:06.930
What effects, my lord?

555
00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:12.100
She will sit you, you heardmy daughter tell you how.

556
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.130
She did, indeed.

557
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.700
How, how, pray you?

558
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.070
You amaze me: I would haveI thought her spirit

559
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:21.930
had been invincible againstall assaults of affection.

560
00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:23.570
I would have swornit had, my lord;

561
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:25.370
especiallyagainst Benedick.

562
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:29.300
I should thinkthis a gull,

563
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.670
but that the white-beardedfellow speaks it:

564
00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:36.500
knavery cannot, sure, hidehimself in such reverence.

565
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.730
He hath ta'en theinfection: hold it up.

566
00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:42.000
Hath she made her affectionknown to Benedick?

567
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.900
No; and swears she neverwill: that's her torment.

568
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.530
'Tis true, indeed; soyour daughter says:

569
00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:50.170
'Shall I, says she,

570
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.070
'that have so oftencountered him with scorn,

571
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:53.270
write to him that I love him?'

572
00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.500
This says she now when she isbeginning to write to him;

573
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.030
for she'll be uptwenty times a night,

574
00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:01.170
and there will shesit in her smock

575
00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:02.970
till she have writa sheet of paper:

576
00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:04.730
my daughter tells us all.

577
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:06.570
Now you talk of asheet of paper,

578
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.000
I remember a pretty jestyour daughter told us of.

579
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.070
O, when she had writ itand was reading it over,

580
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:15.870
she found Benedick andBeatrice between the sheet?

581
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.670
That.

582
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.800
O, she tore the letterinto a thousand halfpence;

583
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.130
railed at herself, thatshe should be so immodest

584
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.300
to write to one thatshe knew would flout her;

585
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:30.200
'I measure him,' saysshe, 'by my own spirit;

586
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.800
for I should flouthim, if he writ to me;

587
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.770
yea, though I lovehim, I should.'

588
00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.730
Then down upon her kneesshe falls, weeps, sobs,

589
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.800
beats her heart,tears her hair,

590
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.470
prays, curses; 'Osweet Benedick!

591
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:43.800
God give me patience!'She doth indeed;

592
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.330
my daughter tells us:

593
00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:49.000
and her ecstasy hathso overcome her

594
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.130
that my daughter issometime afeared

595
00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:54.600
she will do a desperateoutrage to herself:

596
00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.900
it is very true.

597
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.000
It were good that Benedickknew of it by some other,

598
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
if she willnot discover it.

599
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.900
To what end?

600
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:02.930
He would make buta sport of it

601
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:04.630
and torment thepoor lady worse.

602
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.000
An he should, it werean alms to hang him.

603
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.030
She's anexcellent sweet lady;

604
00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:11.070
and, out of all suspicion,she is virtuous.

605
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.670
And she is exceeding wise.

606
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:14.330
In every thing butin loving Benedick.

607
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:21.600
O, my lord, wisdom and bloodcombating in so tender a body,

608
00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.030
we have ten proofs to onethat blood hath the victory.

609
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.300
I am sorry for her,as I have just cause,

610
00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.370
being her uncleand her guardian.

611
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.100
I would she had bestowedthis dotage on me:

612
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.800
I would have daffedall other respects

613
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.530
and made her half myself.

614
00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.970
I pray you, tellBenedick of it,

615
00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:41.430
and hear what a' will say.

616
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:42.930
Were it good, think you?

617
00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.300
Hero thinkssurely she will die;

618
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.900
for she says she willdie, if he love her not,

619
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.930
and she will die, ereshe make her love known,

620
00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:51.700
and she willdie, if he woo her,

621
00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.300
rather than she willbate one breath

622
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.430
of her accustomedcrossness.

623
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.930
She doth well: if she shouldmake tender of her love,

624
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:05.930
'tis very possiblehe'll scorn it;

625
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:07.270
for the man, asyou know all,

626
00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:08.900
hath acontemptible spirit.

627
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.670
He is a very proper man.

628
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.970
He hath indeed agood outward happiness.

629
00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:14.200
Before God!

630
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.730
and, in mymind, very wise.

631
00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:19.770
He doth indeed show somesparks that are like wit.

632
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.670
Well I am sorryfor your niece.

633
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.330
Shall we go seek Benedick,and tell him of her love?

634
00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:28.200
Never tell him, my lord: let herwear it out with good counsel.

635
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.170
Nay, that's impossible: shemay wear her heart out first.

636
00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:35.270
Well, we will hear furtherof it by your daughter:

637
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:37.200
let it cool the while.

638
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.930
I love Benedick well;

639
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.130
and I could wish he wouldmodestly examine himself,

640
00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:46.730
to see how much he isunworthy so good a lady.

641
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.970
Will you walk, my Lord?

642
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:52.700
dinner is ready.

643
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.330
If he do not doteon her upon this,

644
00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:57.870
I will nevertrust my expectation.

645
00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.570
Let there be the samenet spread for her;

646
00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:03.670
and that must your daughterand her gentlewomen carry.

647
00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:04.830
The sport will be,

648
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:07.570
when they hold one an opinionof another's dotage,

649
00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:09.130
and no such matter:

650
00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.830
that's the scenethat I would see,

651
00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:14.200
which will be merelya dumb-show.

652
00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:19.830
Let us send her tocall him in to dinner.

653
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:42.100
This can be no trick: theconference was sadly borne.

654
00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:46.130
They have the truthof this from Hero.

655
00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:50.370
They seem to pity the lady:

656
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:53.700
it seems her affectionshave their full bent.

657
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:56.030
Love me!

658
00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:00.800
why, it must be requited.

659
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.200
I hear how I am censured: theysay I will bear myself proudly,

660
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.100
if I perceive thelove come from her;

661
00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.700
they say too thatshe will rather die

662
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.470
than give anysign of affection.

663
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:20.130
I did never think to marry:I must not seem proud:

664
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:21.970
happy are they thathear their detractions

665
00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:25.100
and can put themto mending.

666
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:28.300
They say the lady isfair; 'tis a truth,

667
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.830
I can bear themwitness; and virtuous;

668
00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.200
'tis so, Icannot reprove it;

669
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:41.530
and wise, butfor loving me;

670
00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:44.070
by my troth, it is noaddition to her wit,

671
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.670
nor no greatargument of her folly,

672
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:50.870
for I will behorribly in love with her.

673
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:52.900
I may chance havesome odd quirks

674
00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.730
and remnants ofwit broken on me,

675
00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:56.900
because I have railed solong against marriage:

676
00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.530
but doth not theappetite alter?

677
00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.600
a man loves themeat in his youth

678
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.830
that he cannotendure in his age.

679
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.870
Shall quips and sentences

680
00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:09.230
and these paperbullets of the brain

681
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:11.030
awe a man from thecareer of his humour?

682
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:20.130
No, the worldmust be peopled.

683
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.000
When I said Iwould die a bachelor,

684
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.870
I did not think I shouldlive till I were married.

685
00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:32.430
Here comes Beatrice.

686
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.900
By this day!

687
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:40.730
she's a fair lady: I do spysome marks of love in her.

688
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:44.130
Against my will I am sent tobid you come in to dinner.

689
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:48.530
Fair Beatrice, Ithank you for your pains.

690
00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:50.400
I took no more painsfor those thanks

691
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.500
than you take pains to thankme: if it had been painful,

692
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.830
I would not have come.

693
00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:58.800
You take pleasurethen in the message?

694
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.330
Yea, just so much as you maytake upon a knife's point

695
00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:07.670
and choke a daw withal.

696
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:12.330
You have no stomach,signior: fare you well.

697
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.300
Ha!

698
00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:27.930
'Against my will I am sent tobid you come in to dinner;'

699
00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:32.300
there's a double meaning inthat 'I took no more pains

700
00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.900
for those thanks than youtook pains to thank me.'

701
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.170
that's as much as to say,

702
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:43.230
Any pains that I take foryou is as easy as thanks.

703
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:44.400
If I do nottake pity of her,

704
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:48.500
