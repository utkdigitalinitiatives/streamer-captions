00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.870


2
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.270
Was not Count John here at supper?

3
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.700
I saw him not.

4
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.830
How tartly that gentleman looks!

5
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.970
I never can see him but I am heart-burned an hour after.

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.230
He is of a very melancholy disposition.

7
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.870
He were an excellent man that were made just

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.600
in the midway between him and Benedick:

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.570
the one is too like an image and says nothing,

10
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.370
and the other too like my lady's eldest son,

11
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.400
evermore tattling.

12
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.030
Then half Signior Benedick's tongue

13
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.130
in Count John's mouth, and half Count John's melancholy

14
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.700
in Signior Benedick's face,--

15
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.400
With a good leg and a good foot, uncle,

16
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.630
and money enough in his purse,

17
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.570
such a man would win any woman in the world,

18
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.170
if a' could get her good-will.

19
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.700
By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband,

20
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.470
if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.

21
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.230
In faith, she's too curst.

22
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.330
Too curst is more than curst:

23
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.230
I shall lessen God's sending that way; for it is said,

24
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.100
'God sends a curst cow short horns;

25
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.830
but to a cow too curst he sends none.

26
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.000
So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.

27
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.130
Just, if he send me no husband;

28
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.270
for the which blessing

29
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.530
I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening.

30
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.430
Lord, I could not endure a husband

31
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.300
with a beard on his face:

32
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.670
I had rather lie in the woollen.

33
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.700
You may light on a husband that hath no beard.

34
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.300
What should I do with him?

35
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.400
dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting-gentlewoman?

36
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.230
He that hath a beard is more than a youth,

37
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.400
and he that hath no beard is less than a man:

38
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.700
and he that is more than a youth is not for me,

39
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.700
and he that is less than a man,

40
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.570
I am not for him:

41
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.830
therefore, I will even take sixpence

42
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.170
in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes into hell.

43
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.530
Well, then, go you into hell?

44
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.300
No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet me,

45
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.370
like an old cuckold, with horns on his head,

46
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.530
and say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice,

47
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.730
get you to heaven;

48
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.830
here's no place for you maids:' so deliver I up my apes,

49
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.600
and away to Saint Peter for the heavens;

50
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.700
he shows me where the bachelors sit,

51
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.270
and there live we as merry as the day is long.

52
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.370
Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father.

53
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.200
Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy

54
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.430
and say 'Father, as it please you.'

55
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.530
But yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow,

56
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.430
or else make another curtsy and say 'Father,

57
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.400
as it please me.'

58
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.870
Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.

59
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.530
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth.

60
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.200
Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered

61
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.670
by a pierce of valiant dust?

62
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.830
to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?

63
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.830
No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;

64
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.870
and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.

65
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.800
Daughter, remember what I told you:

66
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.870
if the prince do solicit you in that kind,

67
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.600
you know your answer.

68
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.900
The fault will be in the music, cousin,

69
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.900
if you be not wooed in good time:

70
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.800
if the prince be too important, tell him there is measure

71
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.300
in every thing and so dance out the answer.

72
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.770
For, hear me, Hero: wooing,

73
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.730
wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,

74
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.570
a measure, and a cinque pace:

75
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.400
the first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig,

76
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.070
and full as fantastical; the wedding,

77
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.330
mannerly-modest, as a measure,

78
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.830
full of state and ancientry;

79
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.000
and then comes repentance

80
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.300
and, with his bad legs, falls into the cinque pace

81
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.570
faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.

82
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.430
Neice, you apprehend passing shrewdly.

83
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.730
I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.

84
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.170
The revellers are entering, brother:

85
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.600
make good room.

86
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.170
(â™ªmusic for dancing)

87
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.630
Lady, will you walk about with your friend?

88
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.270
So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,

89
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.470
I am yours for the walk;

90
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.530
especially when I walk away.

91
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.870
With me in your company?

92
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.300
I may say so, when I please.

93
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.530
And when please you to say so?

94
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.270
When I like your favour;

95
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.300
for God defend the lute should be like the case!

96
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.000
My visor is Philemon's roof;

97
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.770
within the house is Jove.

98
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.400
Why, then, your visor should be thatched.

99
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.430
Speak low, if you speak love.

100
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.130
Well, I would you did like me.

101
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.730
So would not I, for your own sake;

102
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.770
for I have many ill-qualities.

103
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.030
Which is one?

104
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.430
I say my prayers aloud.

105
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.670
I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.

106
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.030
God match me with a good dancer!

107
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.700
Amen.

108
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.400
And God take him out of my sight when the dance is done!

109
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.670
Answer, clerk.

110
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.500
No more words: the clerk is answered.

111
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.370
I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.

112
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.600
At a word, I am not.

113
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.000
I know you by the waggling of your head.

114
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.400
To tell you true, I counterfeit him.

115
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.200
You could never do him so ill-well,

116
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.730
unless you were the very man.

117
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.470
Here's his dry hand up and down: you are he, you are he.

118
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.270
At a word, I am not.

119
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.030
Will you not tell me who told you so?

120
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.130
No, you shall pardon me.

121
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.630
Nor will you not tell me who you are?

122
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.600
Not now.

123
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.930
That I was disdainful,

124
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.970
and that I had my good wit out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'

125
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.470
--well this was Signior Benedick that said so.

126
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.530
What's he?

127
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.900
I am sure you know him well enough.

128
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:26.830
Not I, believe me.

129
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.330
Did he never make you laugh?

130
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.900
I pray you, what is he?

131
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.230
Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;

132
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.430
only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:

133
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.670
none but libertines delight in him;

134
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.030
and the commendation is not in his wit,

135
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.000
but in his villany; for he both pleases men

136
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.700
and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him.

137
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.030
I am sure he is in the fleet: I would he had boarded me.

138
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.470
When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.

139
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.570
Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;

140
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.400
which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,

141
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.130
strikes him into melancholy;

142
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.900
and then there's a partridge wing saved,

143
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.070
for the fool will eat no supper that night.

144
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.730
We must follow the leaders.

145
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.830
In every good thing.

146
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.330
Nay, if they lead to any ill,

147
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.900
I will leave them at the next turning.

148
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.770
Sure my brother is amorous on Hero

149
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.170
and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it.

150
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.800
The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.

151
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.330
And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.

152
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.900
Are not you Signior Benedick?

153
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.570
You know me well; I am he.

154
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.730
Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:

155
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.870
he is enamoured on Hero;

156
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.770
I pray you, dissuade him from her:

157
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.500
she is no equal for his birth:

158
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.100
you may do the part of an honest man in it.

159
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.330
How know you he loves her?

160
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.770
I heard him swear his affection.

161
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:44.500
So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.

162
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.370
Come, let us to the banquet.

163
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.270
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,

164
00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:04.400
But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.

165
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.000
'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.

166
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.070
Friendship is constant in all other things

167
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.130
Save in the office and affairs of love:

168
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.400
Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;

169
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.600
Let every eye negotiate for itself

170
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.800
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch

171
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.770
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.

172
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.300
This is an accident of hourly proof,

173
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.070
Which I mistrusted not.

174
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.470
Farewell, therefore, Hero!

175
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.170
Count Claudio?

176
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.230
Yea, the same.

177
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.130
Come, will you go with me?

178
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.330
Whither?

179
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:49.600
Even to the next willow, about your own business, county.

180
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.930
What fashion will you wear the garland of?

181
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.700
about your neck, like an usurer's chain?

182
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.230
or under your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf?

183
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.270
You must wear it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.

184
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.430
I wish him joy of her.

185
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.230
Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier:

186
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.270
so they sell bullocks.

187
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.230
But did you think the prince would have served you thus?

188
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:10.330
I pray you, leave me.

189
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.830
Ho! now you strike like the blind man:

190
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.200
'twas the boy that stole your meat,

191
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.800
and you'll beat the post.

192
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.200
If it will not be, I'll leave you.

193
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.800
Alas, poor hurt fowl!

194
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.770
now will he creep into sedges.

195
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.230
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me,

196
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.370
and not know me!

197
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.130
The prince's fool!

198
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.470
Ha?

199
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.330
It may be I go under that title because I am merry.

200
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.130
Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong;

201
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.370
I am not so reputed:

202
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.000
it is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice

203
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
that puts the world into her person and so gives me out.

204
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.670
Well, I'll be revenged as I may.

205
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.330
Now, signior, where's the count?

206
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.270
did you see him?

207
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.170
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren:

208
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.870
I told him, and I think I told him true,

209
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.900
that your grace had got the good will of this young lady;

210
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.770
and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,

211
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.130
either to make him a garland,

212
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.400
as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod,

213
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.970
as being worthy to be whipped.

214
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.100
To be whipped!

215
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.000
What's his fault?

216
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.370
The flat transgression of a schoolboy,

217
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.970
who, being overjoyed with finding a birds' nest,

218
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.300
shows it his companion, and he steals it.

219
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.630
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression?

220
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:30.900
The transgression is in the stealer.

221
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.730
Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,

222
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.670
and the garland too;

223
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.900
for the garland he might have worn himself,

224
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.900
and the rod he might have bestowed on you,

225
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.830
who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.

226
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.500
I will but teach them to sing,

227
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.870
and restore them to the owner.

228
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.670
If their singing answer your saying,

229
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:54.700
by my faith, you say honestly.

230
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.600
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you:

231
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.430
the gentleman that danced with her

232
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:06.500
told her she is much wronged by you.

233
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:13.130
O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!

234
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.900
an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her;

235
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:20.800
my very visor began to assume life and scold with her.

236
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.100
She told me, not thinking I had been myself,

237
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.070
that I was the prince's jester,

238
00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.570
that I was duller than a great thaw;

239
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.900
huddling jest upon jest with such impossible

240
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.200
conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark,

241
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.130
with a whole army shooting at me.

242
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:40.170
She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:

243
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.770
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,

244
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.970
there were no living near her;

245
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.930
she would infect to the north star.

246
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.170
I would not marry her, though she were endowed

247
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.970
with all that Adam bad left him before he transgressed:

248
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.100
Come, talk not of her:

249
00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.370
you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel.

250
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.900
I would to God some scholar would conjure her;

251
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.670
for certainly, while she is here,

252
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.070
a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary;

253
00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.630
and people sin upon purpose,

254
00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.330
because they would go thither;

255
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.230
so, indeed, all disquiet, horror and perturbation follows her.

256
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.230
Look, here she comes.

257
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:25.670
Will your grace command me any service to the world's end?

258
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.370
I will go on the slightest errand now

259
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.070
to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;

260
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.200
I will fetch you a tooth-picker now

261
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.070
from the furthest inch of Asia,

262
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:37.470
bring you the length of Prester John's foot,

263
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.500
fetch you a hair off the great Cham's beard,

264
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.870
do you any embassage to the Pigmies,

265
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:46.130
rather than hold three words' conference with this harpy.

266
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.370
You have no employment for me?

267
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:53.070
None, but to desire your good company.

268
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:03.770
O God, sir, here's a dish I love not:

269
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:07.500
I cannot endure my Lady Tongue.

270
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.030
Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick.

271
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:24.330
Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile;

272
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.300
and I gave him use for it,

273
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.830
a double heart for his single one:

274
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:33.000
marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,

275
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.130
therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.

276
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.770
You have put him down, lady,

277
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:38.830
you have put him down.

278
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.230
So I would not he should do me,

279
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.700
my lord, lest I should prove the mother of fools.

280
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.100
I have brought Count Claudio,

281
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.570
whom you sent me to seek.

282
00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.000
Why, how now, count!

283
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.200
wherefore are you sad?

284
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.970
Not sad, my lord.

285
00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.400
How then? sick?

286
00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.930
Neither, my lord.

287
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.030
The count is neither sad, nor sick,

288
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:07.570
nor merry, nor well; but civil count, civil as an orange,

289
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.370
and something of that jealous complexion.

290
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.300
I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;

291
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.470
though, I'll be sworn, if he be so,

292
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:19.000
his conceit is false.

293
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.570
Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name,

294
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:28.330
and fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,

295
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:32.900
and his good will obtained: name the day of marriage,

296
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.730
and God give thee joy!

297
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.100
Count, take of me my daughter,

298
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.700
and with her my fortunes: his grace hath made the match,

299
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.900
and an grace say Amen to it.

300
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.500
Speak, count, 'tis your cue.

301
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:53.800
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy:

302
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.870
I were but little happy, if I could say how much.

303
00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:04.270
Lady, as you are mine, I am yours:

304
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:11.400
I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange.

305
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.400
Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot,

306
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.270
stop his mouth with a kiss,

307
00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.000
and let not him speak neither.

308
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.370
In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.

309
00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.870
Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool,

310
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.900
it keeps on the windy side of care.

311
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:31.370
My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart.

312
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.400
And so she doth, cousin.

313
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.300
Good Lord, for alliance!

314
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.600
Thus goes every one to the world but I,

315
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.170
I may sit in a corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!

316
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.030
Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.

317
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.400
I would rather have one of your father's getting.

318
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.730
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you?

319
00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.000
Your father got excellent husbands,

320
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.830
if a maid could come by them.

321
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.670
Will you have me, lady?

322
00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:00.930
No, my lord, unless I might have another for working-days:

323
00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:04.770
your grace is too costly to wear every day.

324
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.870
But, I beseech your grace, pardon me:

325
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:11.130
I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.

326
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.930
Your silence most offends me,

327
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.330
and to be merry best becomes you;

328
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.970
for, out of question, you were born in a merry hour.

329
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:22.170
No, sure, my lord, my mother cried;

330
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.430
but then there was a star danced,

331
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.600
and under that was I born.

332
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.000
Cousins, God give you joy!

333
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:35.570
Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?

334
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.530
I cry you mercy, uncle.

335
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:41.500
By your grace's pardon.

336
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.570
By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.

337
00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.900
There's little of the melancholy element in her, my lord:

338
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.730
she is never sad but when she sleeps,

339
00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:58.030
and not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,

340
00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.530
she hath often dreamed of unhappiness

341
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:01.530
and waked herself with laughing.

342
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.400
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.

343
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.400
O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.

344
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.130
She were an excellent wife for Benedict.

345
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:14.200
O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,

346
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.000
they would talk themselves mad.

347
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.500
County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?

348
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.000
To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches

349
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.470
till love have all his rites.

350
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:26.430
Not till Monday, my dear son,

351
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.070
which is hence a just seven-night;

352
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:33.130
and a time too brief, too, to have all things answer my mind.

353
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.230
Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:

354
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.930
but, I warrant thee, Claudio,

355
00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:41.100
the time shall not go dully by us.

356
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:45.930
I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules' labours;

357
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.930
which is, to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice

358
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.500
into a mountain of affection the one with the other.

359
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.770
I would fain have it a match,

360
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.600
and I doubt not but to fashion it,

361
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.070
if you three will but minister such assistance

362
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.670
as I shall give you direction.

363
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.970
My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights' watchings.

364
00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.000
And I, my lord.

365
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.900
And you too, gentle Hero?

366
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.930
I will do any modest office,

367
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:11.430
my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband.

368
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.430
And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband

369
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.600
that I know.

370
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:20.530
Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble strain,

371
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.330
of approved valour and confirmed honesty.

372
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.530
I will teach you how to humour your cousin,

373
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.400
that she shall fall in love with Benedick;

374
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.070
and I, with your two helps,

375
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.600
will so practise on Benedick that,

376
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.300
in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach,

377
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.370
he shall fall in love with Beatrice.

378
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:42.830
If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer:

379
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:47.800
his glory shall be ours, for we are the only love-gods.

380
00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.970
Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.

381
00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.500
It is so;

382
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.370
the Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato.

383
00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.930
Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.

384
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.900
Any bar, any cross,

385
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.530
any impediment will be medicinable to me:

386
00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.130
I am sick in displeasure to him,

387
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.970
and whatsoever comes athwart his affection

388
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.830
ranges evenly with mine.

389
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.470
How canst thou cross this marriage?

390
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.170
Not honestly, my lord;

391
00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.730
but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me.

392
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.070
Show me briefly how.

393
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.730
I think I told your lordship a year since,

394
00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.100
how much I am in the favour of Margaret,

395
00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.170
the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.

396
00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.230
I remember.

397
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.800
I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,

398
00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.500
appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.

399
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.630
What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?

400
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.830
The poison of that lies in you to temper.

401
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.970
Go you to the prince your brother;

402
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.100
spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour

403
00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.470
in marrying the renowned Claudio

404
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.600
--whose estimation do you mightily hold up--

405
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.900
to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.

406
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.730
What proof shall I make of that?

407
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.370
Proof enough to misuse the prince,

408
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:15.300
to vex Claudio, to undo Hero and kill Leonato.

409
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.730
Look you for any other issue?

410
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.970
Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.

411
00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.670
Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro

412
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.770
and the Count Claudio alone:

413
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.370
tell them that you know that Hero loves me;

414
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.100
intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and Claudio,

415
00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.900
as, -in love of your brother's honour,

416
00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.270
who hath made this match, and his friend's reputation,

417
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:43.430
who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid,

418
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:44.870
-that you have discovered thus.

419
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:48.900
They will scarcely believe this without trial:

420
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.770
offer them instances; which shall bear no less likelihood

421
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.630
than to see me at her chamber-window,

422
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:58.730
hear me call Margaret Hero,

423
00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.530
hear Margaret term me Borachio;

424
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.100
and bring them to see this

425
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.000
the very night before the intended wedding,

426
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.800
--for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter

427
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.430
that Hero shall be absent,

428
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.400
-and there shall appear

429
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.300
such seeming truth of Hero's disloyalty

430
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.670
that jealousy shall be called assurance

431
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:21.330
and all the preparation overthrown.

432
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:25.100
Grow this to what adverse issue it can,

433
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.330
I will put it in practise.

434
00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.430
Be cunning in the working this,

435
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:33.130
and thy fee is a thousand ducats.

436
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.300
Be you constant in the accusation,

437
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.670
and my cunning shall not shame me.

438
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:45.430
I will presently go learn their day of marriage.

439
00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:57.870
(â™ªsong)

440
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:36.870
Boy!

441
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:38.200
Signior?

442
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.000
In my chamber-window lies a book:

443
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.230
bring it hither to me in the orchard.

444
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.630
I am here already, sir.

445
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.700
I know that; but I would have thee hence,

446
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.030
and here again.

447
00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.700
I do much wonder that one man,

448
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.700
seeing how much another man is a fool

449
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.000
when he dedicates his behaviors to love,

450
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.030
will, after he hath laughed

451
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:12.070
at such shallow follies in others,

452
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:16.700
become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love:

453
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.270
and such a man is Claudio.

454
00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:22.470
I have known when there was no music with him

455
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.130
but the drum and the fife;

456
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:28.100
and now had he rather hear the tabour and the pipe:

457
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.870
I have known when he would have walked ten mile a-foot

458
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:33.500
to see a good armour;

459
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.700
and now will he lie ten nights awake,

460
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.730
carving the fashion of a new doublet.

461
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:41.530
He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose,

462
00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.100
like an honest man and a soldier;

463
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.730
and now is he turned orthography;

464
00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:50.570
his words are a very fantastical banquet,

465
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:56.100
just so many strange dishes.

466
00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.970
May I be so converted and see with these eyes?

467
00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:06.000
I cannot tell; I think not: I will not be sworn,

468
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.130
but love may transform me to an oyster;

469
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:09.730
but I'll take my oath on it,

470
00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:11.600
till he have made an oyster of me,

471
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.200
he shall never make me such a fool.

472
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:19.770
One woman is fair, yet I am well;

473
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:21.330
another is wise, yet I am well;

474
00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:25.800
another virtuous, yet I am well;

475
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.030
but till all graces be in one woman,

476
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.800
one woman shall not come in my grace.

477
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.970
Rich she shall be, that's certain;

478
00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:37.170
wise, or I'll none; virtuous,

479
00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.870
or I'll never cheapen her; fair,

480
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.770
or I'll never look on her; mild,

481
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:42.870
or come not near me;

482
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:48.000
noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse,

483
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.070
an excellent musician, and her hair

484
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:57.670
shall be of what colour it please God.

485
00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:58.770
Ha!

486
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.370
the prince and Monsieur Love!

487
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.630
I will hide me in the arbour.

488
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:10.530
Come, shall we hear this music?

489
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.300
Yea, my good lord.

490
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.830
How still the evening is, As hush'd on purpose

491
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.930
to grace harmony!

492
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.900
See you where Benedick hath hid himself?

493
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.530
O, very well, my lord: the music ended,

494
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.300
We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.

495
00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:32.500
Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.

496
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.530
O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice

497
00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.230
To slander music any more than once.

498
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.170
It is the witness still of excellency

499
00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:42.600
To put a strange face on his own perfection.

500
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.300
I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.

501
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:51.670
Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.

502
00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:02.300
Now, divine air!

503
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.100
now is his soul ravished!

504
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.300
Is it not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls

505
00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.600
out of men's bodies?

506
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:14.830
Well, a horn for my money, when all's done.

507
00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:16.930
(â™ªsinging) Men were deceivers ever,

508
00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:21.800
foot in sea and one on shore, To one thing constant never:

509
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:26.730
Then sigh not so, but let them go,

510
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:31.800
And be you blithe and bonny,

511
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:43.030
Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny, nonny.

512
00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:49.270
Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,

513
00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:55.100
Of dumps so dull and heavy;

514
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:59.300
The fraud of men was ever so,

515
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:04.900
Since summer first was leafy:

516
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:15.230
Then sigh not so, And be you blithe and bonny,

517
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:25.270
Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny, nonny.

518
00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:32.070
Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny, nonny.

519
00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.900
By my troth, a good song.

520
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.330
And an ill singer, my lord.

521
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:42.900
Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.

522
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.530
An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,

523
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.230
they would have hanged him: and I pray God

524
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.430
his bad voice bode no mischief.

525
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.700
I had as lief have heard the night-raven,

526
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.800
come what plague could have come after it.

527
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.800
Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar?

528
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.770
I pray thee, get us some excellent music;

529
00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:02.500
for to-morrow night we would have it

530
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.100
at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.

531
00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.700
The best I can, my lord.

532
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.230
Do so: farewell.

533
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.500
Come hither, Leonato.

534
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.730
What was it you told me of to-day,

535
00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:22.530
that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick?

536
00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.100
O, ay:

537
00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.370
stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits.

538
00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:29.730
I did never think that lady would have loved any man.

539
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:32.900
No, nor I neither; but most wonderful

540
00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.970
that she should so dote on Signior Benedick,

541
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:39.470
whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.

542
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:41.100
Is't possible?

543
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.200
Sits the wind in that corner?

544
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.500
By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it

545
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.870
but that she loves him with an enraged affection:

546
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.130
it is past the infinite of thought.

547
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.630
May be she doth but counterfeit.

548
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.100
Faith, like enough.

549
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.270
O God, counterfeit!

550
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.030
There was never counterfeit of passion

551
00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.500
came so near the life of passion as she discovers it.

552
00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.500
Why, what effects of passion shows she?

553
00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.670
Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.

554
00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:06.930
What effects, my lord?

555
00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:12.100
She will sit you, you heard my daughter tell you how.

556
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.130
She did, indeed.

557
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.700
How, how, pray you?

558
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.070
You amaze me: I would have I thought her spirit

559
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:21.930
had been invincible against all assaults of affection.

560
00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:23.570
I would have sworn it had, my lord;

561
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:25.370
especially against Benedick.

562
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:29.300
I should think this a gull,

563
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.670
but that the white-bearded fellow speaks it:

564
00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:36.500
knavery cannot, sure, hide himself in such reverence.

565
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.730
He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.

566
00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:42.000
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?

567
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.900
No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.

568
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.530
'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says:

569
00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:50.170
'Shall I, says she,

570
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.070
'that have so oft encountered him with scorn,

571
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:53.270
write to him that I love him?'

572
00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.500
This says she now when she is beginning to write to him;

573
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.030
for she'll be up twenty times a night,

574
00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:01.170
and there will she sit in her smock

575
00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:02.970
till she have writ a sheet of paper:

576
00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:04.730
my daughter tells us all.

577
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:06.570
Now you talk of a sheet of paper,

578
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.000
I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of.

579
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.070
O, when she had writ it and was reading it over,

580
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:15.870
she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?

581
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.670
That.

582
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.800
O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;

583
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.130
railed at herself, that she should be so immodest

584
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.300
to write to one that she knew would flout her;

585
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:30.200
'I measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit;

586
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.800
for I should flout him, if he writ to me;

587
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.770
yea, though I love him, I should.'

588
00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.730
Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,

589
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.800
beats her heart, tears her hair,

590
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.470
prays, curses; 'O sweet Benedick!

591
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:43.800
God give me patience!' She doth indeed;

592
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.330
my daughter tells us:

593
00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:49.000
and her ecstasy hath so overcome her

594
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.130
that my daughter is sometime afeared

595
00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:54.600
she will do a desperate outrage to herself:

596
00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.900
it is very true.

597
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.000
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other,

598
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
if she will not discover it.

599
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.900
To what end?

600
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:02.930
He would make but a sport of it

601
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:04.630
and torment the poor lady worse.

602
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.000
An he should, it were an alms to hang him.

603
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.030
She's an excellent sweet lady;

604
00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:11.070
and, out of all suspicion, she is virtuous.

605
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.670
And she is exceeding wise.

606
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:14.330
In every thing but in loving Benedick.

607
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:21.600
O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body,

608
00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.030
we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory.

609
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.300
I am sorry for her, as I have just cause,

610
00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.370
being her uncle and her guardian.

611
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.100
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me:

612
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.800
I would have daffed all other respects

613
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.530
and made her half myself.

614
00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.970
I pray you, tell Benedick of it,

615
00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:41.430
and hear what a' will say.

616
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:42.930
Were it good, think you?

617
00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.300
Hero thinks surely she will die;

618
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.900
for she says she will die, if he love her not,

619
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.930
and she will die, ere she make her love known,

620
00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:51.700
and she will die, if he woo her,

621
00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.300
rather than she will bate one breath

622
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.430
of her accustomed crossness.

623
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.930
She doth well: if she should make tender of her love,

624
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:05.930
'tis very possible he'll scorn it;

625
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:07.270
for the man, as you know all,

626
00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:08.900
hath a contemptible spirit.

627
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.670
He is a very proper man.

628
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.970
He hath indeed a good outward happiness.

629
00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:14.200
Before God!

630
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.730
and, in my mind, very wise.

631
00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:19.770
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.

632
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.670
Well I am sorry for your niece.

633
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.330
Shall we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?

634
00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:28.200
Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with good counsel.

635
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.170
Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.

636
00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:35.270
Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:

637
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:37.200
let it cool the while.

638
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.930
I love Benedick well;

639
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.130
and I could wish he would modestly examine himself,

640
00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:46.730
to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.

641
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.970
Will you walk, my Lord?

642
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:52.700
dinner is ready.

643
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.330
If he do not dote on her upon this,

644
00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:57.870
I will never trust my expectation.

645
00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.570
Let there be the same net spread for her;

646
00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:03.670
and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry.

647
00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:04.830
The sport will be,

648
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:07.570
when they hold one an opinion of another's dotage,

649
00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:09.130
and no such matter:

650
00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.830
that's the scene that I would see,

651
00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:14.200
which will be merely a dumb-show.

652
00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:19.830
Let us send her to call him in to dinner.

653
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:42.100
This can be no trick: the conference was sadly borne.

654
00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:46.130
They have the truth of this from Hero.

655
00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:50.370
They seem to pity the lady:

656
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:53.700
it seems her affections have their full bent.

657
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:56.030
Love me!

658
00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:00.800
why, it must be requited.

659
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.200
I hear how I am censured: they say I will bear myself proudly,

660
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.100
if I perceive the love come from her;

661
00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.700
they say too that she will rather die

662
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.470
than give any sign of affection.

663
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:20.130
I did never think to marry: I must not seem proud:

664
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:21.970
happy are they that hear their detractions

665
00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:25.100
and can put them to mending.

666
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:28.300
They say the lady is fair; 'tis a truth,

667
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.830
I can bear them witness; and virtuous;

668
00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.200
'tis so, I cannot reprove it;

669
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:41.530
and wise, but for loving me;

670
00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:44.070
by my troth, it is no addition to her wit,

671
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.670
nor no great argument of her folly,

672
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:50.870
for I will be horribly in love with her.

673
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:52.900
I may chance have some odd quirks

674
00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.730
and remnants of wit broken on me,

675
00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:56.900
because I have railed so long against marriage:

676
00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.530
but doth not the appetite alter?

677
00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.600
a man loves the meat in his youth

678
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.830
that he cannot endure in his age.

679
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.870
Shall quips and sentences

680
00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:09.230
and these paper bullets of the brain

681
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:11.030
awe a man from the career of his humour?

682
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:20.130
No, the world must be peopled.

683
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.000
When I said I would die a bachelor,

684
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.870
I did not think I should live till I were married.

685
00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:32.430
Here comes Beatrice.

686
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.900
By this day!

687
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:40.730
she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in her.

688
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:44.130
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.

689
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:48.530
Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.

690
00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:50.400
I took no more pains for those thanks

691
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.500
than you take pains to thank me: if it had been painful,

692
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.830
I would not have come.

693
00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:58.800
You take pleasure then in the message?

694
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.330
Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's point

695
00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:07.670
and choke a daw withal.

696
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:12.330
You have no stomach, signior: fare you well.

697
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.300
Ha!

698
00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:27.930
'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner;'

699
00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:32.300
there's a double meaning in that 'I took no more pains

700
00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.900
for those thanks than you took pains to thank me.'

701
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.170
that's as much as to say,

702
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:43.230
Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks.

703
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:44.400
If I do not take pity of her,

704
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:48.500
I am a villain; if I do not love her,

705
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.870
I am a Jew.

706
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.800
