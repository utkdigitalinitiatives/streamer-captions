00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:54.570


2
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.970
Hey! Hey!

3
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.900
Hey! Hey!

4
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.700
Hey! Hey!

5
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.430
Now is the winter of our discontent

6
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.630
made glorious summer by this son of York.

7
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.200
And all the clouds that lowered upon our house

8
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.730
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

9
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.930
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,

10
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.900
our bruised arms hung up for monuments,

11
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.300
our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,

12
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.200
our dreadful marches to delightful measures.

13
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.870
Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front,

14
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.370
and now, instead of mounting barbed steeds

15
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.900
to fright the souls of fearful adversaries,

16
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.170
he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber

17
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.170
to the lascivious pleasing of a lute.

18
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.670
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks

19
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.670
nor made to court an amorous looking glass;

20
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.830
I, that am rudely stamped

21
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.030
and want love's majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph;

22
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.170
I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion,

23
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.030
cheated of feature by dissembling nature,

24
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.870
deformed, unfinished,

25
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.770
sent before my time into this breathing world

26
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.470
scarce half made up,

27
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.030
and that so lamely and unfashionable

28
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.230
that dogs bark at me as I halt by them--

29
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.330
why I, in this weak piping time of peace

30
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.300
have no delight to pass away the time,

31
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.900
unless to spy my shadow in the sun

32
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.400
and descant on my own deformity.

33
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.900
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover

34
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.900
to entertain these fair well-spoken days,

35
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.200
I am determined to prove a villain

36
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.470
and hate the idle pleasures of these days.

37
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.370
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,

38
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.030
by drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,

39
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.770
to set my brother Clarence and the king in deadly hate

40
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.370
the one against the other.

41
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.770
And if King Edward be as true and just

42
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.100
as I am subtle, false, and treacherous,

43
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.070
this day should Clarence closely be mewed up

44
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.300
about a prophecy which says

45
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.070
that G of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.

46
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.230
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul.

47
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.070
Here Clarence comes.

48
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.500
Brother, good day.

49
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.900
What means this armed guard that waits upon your grace?

50
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.270
His majesty, tendering my person's safety,

51
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.900
hath appointed this conduct to convey me to the Tower.

52
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.030
Upon what cause?

53
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.500
Because my name is George.

54
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.070
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours.

55
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.870
He should for that commit your godfathers.

56
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.370
Oh, belike his majesty hath some intent

57
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.830
that you shall be new-christened in the Tower.

58
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.000
What's the matter, Clarence?

59
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.100
May I know?

60
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.600
Yea, Richard, when I know,

61
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.770
for I protest, as yet I do not.

62
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.430
But as I can learn, he hearkens after prophecies and dreams

63
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.700
and from the cross-row plucks the letter G

64
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.430
and says a wizard told him

65
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.870
that by G his issue disinherited should be.

66
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.170
And, for my name of George begins with G,

67
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.330
it follows in his thought that I am he.

68
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.970
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these

69
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.130
have moved his highness to commit me now.

70
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.170
Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women.

71
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.500
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower.

72
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.230
My Lady Grey, his wife, Clarence;

73
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.870
'tis she that tempers him to this extremity.

74
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.130
Was it not she and that good man of worship,

75
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.130
Anthony Woodville, her brother there,

76
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.370
that made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,

77
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.730
from whence this present day he is delivered?

78
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.930
We are not safe, Clarence.

79
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.170
We are not safe.

80
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.730
By heaven, I think there is no man secure

81
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.230
but the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds

82
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.600
that trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.

83
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.070
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant

84
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.100
Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?

85
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.970
Humbly complaining to her deity

86
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.230
got my lord chamberlain his liberty.

87
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.400
I'll tell you what.

88
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.770
I think it is our way,

89
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.370
if we will keep in favor with the king,

90
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.930
to be her men and wear her livery.

91
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.700
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,

92
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.630
since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen,

93
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.970
are mighty gossips in our monarchy.

94
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.230
I beseech your graces both to pardon me.

95
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.670
His majesty hath straitly given in charge

96
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.000
that no man shall have private conference

97
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.670
of what degree soever with his brother.

98
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.370
Even so, and it please your worship, Brakenbury,

99
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.430
you may partake of anything we say.

100
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.400
We speak no treason, man.

101
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.000
We say the king is wise and virtuous

102
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.930
and his noble queen well struck in years, fair, and not jealous.

103
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.700
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot, a cherry lip,

104
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.730
a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue,

105
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.970
and that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folk.

106
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.770
Now how say you, sir?

107
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.000
Can you deny all this?

108
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.630
With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.

109
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.000
Naught with Mistress Shore?

110
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.670
I tell thee, fellow,

111
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.730
he that doth naught with her, excepting one,

112
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.530
were best to do it secretly, alone.

113
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.100
What one, my lord?

114
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.830
Her husband, knave. Wouldst thou betray me?

115
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.070
I do beseech your grace to pardon me

116
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.200
and withal forbear your conference with the noble duke.

117
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.600
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.

118
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.270
We are the queen's objects and must obey.

119
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.470
Brother, farewell.

120
00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.800
I will unto the king.

121
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.000
And whatsoe'er you will employ me in,

122
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.400
were it to call King Edward's widow sister,

123
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.070
I will perform it to enfranchise you.

124
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.100
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood

125
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.570
touches me deeper than you can imagine.

126
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.870
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.

127
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.930
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long.

128
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.100
I will deliver you or else lie for you.

129
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.470
Meantime, have patience.

130
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.230
I must, perforce.

131
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:30.700
Farewell.

132
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.830
Go; tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.

133
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.830
Simple, plain Clarence.

134
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.200
I do love thee so

135
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.870
that I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,

136
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.630
if heaven will take the present at our hands.

137
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.630
But who comes here?

138
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.270
The new-delivered Hastings.

139
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.000
Good time of day unto my gracious lord.

140
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.700
As much unto my good lord chamberlain.

141
00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.800
Well are you welcome to the open air.

142
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.570
How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment?

143
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.300
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must.

144
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.800
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks

145
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.600
that were the cause of my imprisonment.

146
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.470
No doubt, no doubt, and so shall Clarence too,

147
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.100
for they that were your enemies are his

148
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.070
and have prevailed as much on him as you.

149
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.200
More pity that the eagle should be mewed

150
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.630
while kites and buzzards prey at liberty.

151
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.030
What news abroad?

152
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.730
No news so bad abroad as this at home.

153
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.870
The king is sickly, weak, melancholy,

154
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.530
and his physicians fear him mightily.

155
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.800
Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed.

156
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.430
O, he hath kept an evil diet long

157
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.870
and overmuch consumed his royal person.

158
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.970
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.

159
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.900
Where is he, in his bed?

160
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.270
He is.

161
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.270
Go you before, and I will follow you.

162
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.400
He cannot live, I hope, and must not die

163
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.570
till George be packed with post-horse up to heaven.

164
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.700
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence

165
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.100
with lies well steeled with weighty arguments.

166
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.530
And if I fail not in my deep intent,

167
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.930
Clarence hath not another day to live;

168
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.630
which done, God take King Edward to his mercy

169
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.530
and leave the world for me to bustle in,

170
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.270
for then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.

171
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.800
What though I killed her husband and her father?

172
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.300
The readiest way to make the wench amends

173
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.770
is to become her husband and her father,

174
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.400
the which will I,

175
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.200
not all so much for love as for another secret close intent,

176
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.970
by marrying her which I must reach unto.

177
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.600
But yet I run before my horse to market.

178
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.600
Clarence still breathes.

179
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.270
Edward still lives and reigns.

180
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.600
When they are gone, then must I count my gain.

181
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.200
Set down, set down your honorable load,

182
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.130
if honor may be shrouded in a hearse,

183
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.200
whilst I awhile obsequiously lament

184
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.770
the untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.

185
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.870
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king,

186
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.230
pale ashes of the house of Lancaster,

187
00:10:54.230 --> 00:11:00.300
thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood.

188
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.170
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost

189
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.300
to hear the lamentations of poor Anne,

190
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.530
wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtered son,

191
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:17.300
stabbed by the selfsame hand that made these wounds.

192
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:23.000
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,

193
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.330
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.

194
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:34.400
O, cursed be the hand that made these holes,

195
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.170
cursed the heart that had the heart to do it,

196
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:43.730
cursed the blood that let this blood from hence.

197
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.400
More direful hap betide that hated wretch

198
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.070
that makes us wretched by the death of thee

199
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.400
than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,

200
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.670
or any creeping venomed thing that lives.

201
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:02.130
If ever he have child, abortive be it,

202
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.630
prodigious, and untimely brought to light,

203
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.700
whose ugly and unnatural aspect

204
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.570
may fright the hopeful mother at the view,

205
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.970
and that be heir to his unhappiness.

206
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.270
If ever he have wife,

207
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:19.270
let her be made more miserable by the death of him

208
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.730
than I am made by my young lord and thee.

209
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.270
Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load,

210
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.100
taken from Paul's to be interred there.

211
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:46.300
Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.

212
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.800
What black magician conjures up this fiend

213
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.870
to stop devoted charitable deeds?

214
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.130
Villains, set down the corse, or, by Saint Paul,

215
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.300
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.

216
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.730
My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.

217
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.530
Unmannered dog, stand thou, when I command.

218
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.130
Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,

219
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.130
or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot

220
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.600
and spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness!

221
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.630
What? Do you tremble?

222
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.500
Are you all afraid?

223
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.400
Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,

224
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.330
and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.

225
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.030
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell.

226
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.300
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body.

227
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.600
His soul thou canst not have; therefore ,be gone.

228
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.570
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.

229
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.400
Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not,

230
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.830
for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,

231
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.830
filled it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.

232
00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.370
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,

233
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.230
behold this pattern of thy butcheries!

234
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:09.500
O, gentlemen, see, see!

235
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.030
Dead Henry's wounds open their congealed mouths

236
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.170
and bleed afresh!

237
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.730
Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,

238
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.370
for 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood

239
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.600
from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells.

240
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.500
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,

241
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.200
provokes this deluge most unnatural.

242
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.230
O God, which this blood madest,

243
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.700
revenge his death!

244
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.070
O earth, which this blood drinkest,

245
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.300
revenge his death!

246
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.800
Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead,

247
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.800
or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,

248
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.200
as thou dost swallow up this good king's blood,

249
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.270
which his hell-governed arm hath butchered!

250
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.600
Lady, you know no rules of charity,

251
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.530
which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.

252
00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.330
Villain, thou knowest no law of God nor man.

253
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.970
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.

254
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.230
But I know none and therefore am no beast.

255
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.170
O wonderful, when devils speak the truth!

256
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.270
More wonderful when angels are so angry.

257
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.530
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,

258
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.500
of these supposed crimes to give me leave

259
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.070
by circumstance but to acquit myself.

260
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.900
Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,

261
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.200
of these known evils but to give me leave

262
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.000
by circumstance to accuse thy cursed self!

263
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.370
Fairer than tongue can name thee.

264
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.830
Let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself.

265
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.630
Fouler than heart can think thee.

266
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.870
Thou canst make no excuse current but to hang thyself!

267
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.830
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

268
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.170
And by despairing shalt thou stand excused

269
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.230
for doing worthy vengeance on thyself,

270
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.470
that didst unworthy slaughter upon others.

271
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.600
Say that I slew them not.

272
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.330
Then say they were not slain, but dead they are,

273
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.670
and, devilish slave, by thee.

274
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:51.670
I did not kill your husband.

275
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.930
Why, then he is alive.

276
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.630
Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward's hand.

277
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.770
In thy foul throat, thou liest.

278
00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.770
Queen Margaret saw thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood,

279
00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.370
the which thou once didst spend against her breast,

280
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.230
but that thy brothers beat aside the point.

281
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.000
I was provoked by her slanderous tongue

282
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.330
that laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.

283
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.600
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,

284
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.270
that never dreamt on aught but butcheries.

285
00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.970
Didst thou not kill this king?

286
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.330
I grant ye, aye.

287
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.830
Dost grant me, hedgehog?

288
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.600
Then God grant me too

289
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.500
thou mayest be damned for that wicked deed!

290
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.430
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!

291
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.400
The better for the King of Heaven, that hath him.

292
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.300
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.

293
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.370
Let him thank me that holp to send him thither,

294
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.200
for he was fitter for that place than earth.

295
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.200
And thou unfit for any place but hell.

296
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.900
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.

297
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.900
Some dungeon.

298
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.270
Your bedchamber.

299
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.600
Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!

300
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.200
So will it, madam, till I lie with you.

301
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.300
I hope so.

302
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.230
I know so.

303
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.100
But, gentle Lady Anne,

304
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.900
to leave this keen encounter of our wits

305
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.470
and fall something into a slower method,

306
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.070
is not the causer of the timeless deaths

307
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.270
of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,

308
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.230
as blameful as the executioner?

309
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.900
Thou wast the cause and most accursed effect.

310
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.800
Your beauty was the cause of that effect,

311
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.070
your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep

312
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:16.700
to undertake the death of all the world

313
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.770
so I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.

314
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.770
If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,

315
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.500
these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.

316
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.570
These eyes could not endure that beauty's wreck.

317
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:28.570
You should not blemish it if I stood by.

318
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:31.900
As all the world is cheered by the sun, so I by that.

319
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.230
It is my day, my life.

320
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.770
Black night o'ershade thy day and death thy life!

321
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.700
Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.

322
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.230
I would I were to be revenged on thee.

323
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.900
It is a quarrel most unnatural

324
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.530
to be revenged on him that loveth thee.

325
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.270
It is a quarrel just and reasonable

326
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.030
to be revenged on him that killed my husband.

327
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.870
He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband

328
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.470
did it to help thee to a better husband.

329
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.600
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.

330
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.530
He lives that loves thee better than he could.

331
00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:54.130
Name him.

332
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:54.770
Plantagenet.

333
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:55.770
Why, that was he.

334
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.330
The selfsame name but one of better nature.

335
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:57.930
Where is he?

336
00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:58.930
Here.

337
00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.770
Why dost thou spit at me?

338
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.130
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake.

339
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.300
Never came poison from so sweet a place.

340
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.600
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.

341
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.000
Out of my sight! Thou dost infect mine eyes.

342
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.030
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.

343
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.700
Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!

344
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.600
I would they were, that I might die at once,

345
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.800
for now they kill me with a living death.

346
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.330
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,

347
00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.470
shamed their aspects with store of childish drops.

348
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.430
These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear,

349
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.100
no, when my father York and Edward wept

350
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.070
to hear the piteous moan that Rutland made

351
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:38.600
when black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him

352
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.200
nor when thy warlike father, like a child,

353
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.770
told the sad story of my father's death

354
00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.100
and twenty times made pause to sob and weep,

355
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.100
that all the standers-by had wet their cheeks

356
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.470
like trees bedashed with rain.

357
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.970
In that sad time, my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear,

358
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.670
and what these sorrows could not thence exhale,

359
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:00.900
thy beauty hath,

360
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.930
and made them blind with weeping.

361
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.900
I never sued to friend nor enemy.

362
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.400
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word.

363
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.430
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,

364
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.330
my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak.

365
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.670
Teach not thy lip such scorn,

366
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.630
for it was made for kissing, lady,

367
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.700
not for such contempt.

368
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.730
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,

369
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.530
lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword,

370
00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.630
which if thou please to hide in this true breast

371
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.300
and lay the soul forth that adoreth thee,

372
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.300
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke

373
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.770
and humbly beg the death upon my knee.

374
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.230
Nay, do not pause, for I did kill King Henry,

375
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.600
but 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.

376
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.800
Nay, now dispatch!

377
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.570
'Twas I that stabbed young Edward,

378
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.830
but 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.

379
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.500
Take up the sword again, or take up me.

380
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.800
Arise, dissembler.

381
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.770
Though I wish thy death, I will not be thy executioner.

382
00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.230
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.

383
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:56.230
I have already.

384
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.330
That was in thy rage.

385
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.070
Speak it again, and even with the word,

386
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.230
this hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,

387
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.730
shall for thy love kill a far truer love.

388
00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.900
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessory.

389
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.070
I would I knew thy heart.

390
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.370
'Tis figured in my tongue.

391
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.870
I fear me both are false.

392
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.500
Then never was man true.

393
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.700
Well, well, put up your sword.

394
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.030
Say, then, my peace is made.

395
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.430
That thou shalt know hereafter.

396
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.100
But shall I live in hope?

397
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.930
All men, I hope, live so.

398
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.930
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.

399
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.570
To take is not to give.

400
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.600
Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger.

401
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.530
Even so, thy breast encloseth my poor heart.

402
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.100
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.

403
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.400
And if thy poor, devoted servant

404
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.100
may but beg one favor at thy gracious hand,

405
00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.300
thou dost confirm his happiness forever.

406
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.900
What is it?

407
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.200
That it may please you leave these sad designs

408
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.970
to him that hath most cause to be a mourner

409
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.830
and presently repair to Crosby Place,

410
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:12.600
where, after I have solemnly interred

411
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.170
at Chertsey Monastery this noble king

412
00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.330
and wet his grave with my repentant tears,

413
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.170
I will with all expedient duty see you

414
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.630
for divers unknown reasons.

415
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.370
I beseech you, grant me this boon.

416
00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:32.000
With all my heart, and much it joys me too,

417
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.470
to see you are become so penitent.

418
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.900
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.

419
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.830
Bid me farewell.

420
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:44.270
'Tis more than you deserve.

421
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.930
But since you teach me how to flatter you,

422
00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:50.100
imagine I have said farewell already.

423
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.770
Sirs, take up the corse.

424
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.830
Towards Chertsey, noble lord?

425
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:07.600
No, to Whitefriars; there attend my coming.

426
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.530
Was ever woman in this humor wooed?

427
00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.530
Was ever woman in this humor won?

428
00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.270
I'll have her, but I will not keep her long.

429
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:29.330
What?

430
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.970
I, that killed her husband and his father,

431
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.930
to take her in her heart's extremest hate,

432
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.030
curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,

433
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.670
the bleeding witness of her hatred by;

434
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.700
having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,

435
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.700
and I, no friends to back my suit at all

436
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.600
but the plain devil and dissembling looks,

437
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.870
and yet to win her, all the world to nothing.

438
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.630
Hath she forgot already that brave prince, Edward, her lord,

439
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.670
whom I, some three months since,

440
00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.170
stabbed in my angry mood at Tewksbury?

441
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.000
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,

442
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.500
framed in the prodigality of nature,

443
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.400
young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,

444
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.130
the spacious world cannot again afford.

445
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.770
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,

446
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.970
that cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince

447
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.970
and made her widow to a woeful bed?

448
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:23.700
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?

449
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.600
On me, who halts and am misshapen thus?

450
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:31.630
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,

451
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.830
I do mistake my person all this while.

452
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:37.400
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,

453
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.670
myself to be a marvelous proper man.

454
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.170
I'll be at charges for a looking glass

455
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.670
and entertain a score or two of tailors

456
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.770
to study fashion to adorn my body.

457
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.970
Since I am crept in favor with myself,

458
00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.370
I will maintain it at some little cost.

459
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.030
But first, I'll turn yon fellow in his grave

460
00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:02.130
and then return, lamenting to my love.

461
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.070
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,

462
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.330
that I might see my shadow as I pass.

463
00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.130
Have patience, sister.

464
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.330
There's no doubt

465
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.000
his majesty will soon recover his accustom'd health.

466
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.500
In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse.

467
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.870
Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,

468
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.900
and cheer his grace with quick and merry eyes.

469
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.000
If he were dead, what would betide of me?

470
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.200
No other harm but loss of such a lord.

471
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.130
The loss of such a lord includes all harms!

472
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:40.770
The heavens have blessed you with a goodly son

473
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.770
to be your comforter when he is gone.

474
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.670
Ah, he is young, and his minority is put

475
00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.370
unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,

476
00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.370
a man who loves not me nor none of you.

477
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.200
Is it concluded he shall be protector?

478
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.930
It is determined, not concluded yet,

479
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.230
but so it must be, if the king miscarry.

480
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.330
Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.

481
00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.270
Good time of day unto your royal grace.

482
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.400
God make your majesty joyful as you have been.

483
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.330
The Countess Richmond, good my lord of Derby,

484
00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.230
to your good prayer would scarcely say amen.

485
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:14.800
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife

486
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.700
and loves not me, be you, good lord, assured

487
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.700
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.

488
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.800
I do beseech you, either not believe

489
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.270
the envious slanders of her false accusers,

490
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.630
or, if she be accused on true report,

491
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.470
bear with her weakness,

492
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.370
which, I think, proceeds from wayward sickness

493
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.070
and no grounded malice.

494
00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:39.970
Saw you the king today, my lord of Derby?

495
00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.630
But now the duke of Buckingham and I

496
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:43.270
are come from visiting his majesty.

497
00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.030
What likelihood of his amendment, lords?

498
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.230
Madam, good hope.

499
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.070
His grace speaks cheerfully.

500
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.100
God grant him health.

501
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.600
Did you confer with him?

502
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.630
Aye, madam.

503
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.130
He desires to make atonement

504
00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:55.830
between the duke of Gloucester and your brothers

505
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.900
and between them and my lord chamberlain

506
00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.930
and sent to warn them to his royal presence.

507
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.370
Would all were well.

508
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.900
But that will never be.

509
00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.230
I fear our happiness is at the height.

510
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:10.130
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it.

511
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.500
Who is it that complains unto the king

512
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.070
that I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?

513
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.370
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly

514
00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.300
that fill his ears with such dissentious rumors.

515
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.230
Because I cannot flatter and look fair,

516
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:25.600
smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,

517
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.000
duck with French nods and apish courtesy,

518
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.900
I must be held a rancorous enemy.

519
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.330
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,

520
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.430
but thus his simple truth must be abused

521
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.330
with silken, sly, insinuating jacks?

522
00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.430
To who in all this presence speaks your grace?

523
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:44.430
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.

524
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:45.830
When have I injured thee?

525
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.030
When done thee wrong?

526
00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.770
Or thee? Or thee?

527
00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.530
Or any of your faction?

528
00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:51.830
A plague upon you all!

529
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.030
His royal grace,

530
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:54.930
whom God preserve better than you would wish,

531
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.070
cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while

532
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.070
but you must trouble him with lewd complaints.

533
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:01.170
Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.

534
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.430
The king, on his own royal disposition

535
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.430
and not provoked by any suitor else,

536
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:08.030
aiming, belike, at your interior hatred

537
00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:09.830
that in your outward actions shows itself

538
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:12.430
against my children, brothers, and myself,

539
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.700
makes him to send,

540
00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.530
that he may learn the ground of your ill will

541
00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:17.270
and thereby to remove it.

542
00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.630
I cannot tell.

543
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.170
The world is grown so bad

544
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.630
that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.

545
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.430
Since every jack became a gentleman,

546
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.200
there's many a gentleperson made a jack.

547
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.600
Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloucester.

548
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.200
You envy my advancement and my friends'.

549
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.700
God grant we never may have need of you!

550
00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.730
Meantime, God grants that we have need of you.

551
00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:42.170
Our brother is imprison'd by your means,

552
00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:43.630
myself disgraced,

553
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:45.400
and the nobility held in contempt,

554
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.430
while great promotions are daily given

555
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.830
to ennoble those that scarce some two days since

556
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.030
were worth a noble.

557
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.400
By Him that raised me to this careful height

558
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.700
from that contented hap which I enjoyed,

559
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.870
I never did incense his majesty against the duke of Clarence

560
00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.370
but have been an earnest advocate to plead for him.

561
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.300
My lord, you do me shameful injury

562
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.770
falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.

563
00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.700
You may deny that you were not the mean

564
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.900
of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.

565
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:10.900
She may, my lord, for--

566
00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:11.970
She may, Lord Rivers.

567
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.430
Why, who knows not so?

568
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:15.730
She may do more, sir, than denying that.

569
00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:18.500
She may help you to many fair preferments

570
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.130
and then deny her aiding hand therein

571
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.070
and lay those honors on your high desert.

572
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.170
What may she not?

573
00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:25.170
She may. Aye, marry, may she.

574
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.700
What, marry, may she?

575
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.200
What, marry, may she?

576
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:32.200
Marry with a king, a bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.

577
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.070
I wish your grandam had a worser match.

578
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.870
My lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne

579
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.470
your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.

580
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:43.770
By Heaven, I will acquaint his majesty

581
00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:46.330
of those gross taunts that oft I have endured!

582
00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.570
I had rather be a country servant maid

583
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.200
than a great queen with this condition

584
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.330
to be so baited, scorned, and stormed at.

585
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:56.030
Small joy have I in being England's queen!

586
00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:59.630
And lessened be that small, God, I beseech Him.

587
00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.200
Thy honor, state, and seat are due to me.

588
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.200
What!

589
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.970
Threat you me with telling of the king?

590
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:06.400
Tell him, and spare not.

591
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.730
Look, what I have said,

592
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:09.430
I will avouch in presence of the king.

593
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:12.200
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.

594
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.700
'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.

595
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.970
Out, devil!

596
00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:17.870
I remember them too well.

597
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.670
Thou kills't my husband Henry in the Tower

598
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.100
and Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.

599
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.900
Ere you were queen, aye, or your husband king,

600
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.200
I was a packhorse in his great affairs,

601
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.630
a weeder-out of his proud adversaries,

602
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:31.730
a liberal rewarder of his friends.

603
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.330
To royalize his blood, I spent mine own.

604
00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:37.470
Aye, and much better blood than his or thine.

605
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.430
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,

606
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:42.000
what you have been ere this and what you are;

607
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.570
withal, what I have been and what I am.

608
00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:47.970
A murderous villain, and so still thou art.

609
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.230
Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick.

610
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.830
Aye, and forswore himself, which, Jesu pardon--

611
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.230
Which God revenge.

612
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.130
To fight on Edward's party for the crown.

613
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.700
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.

614
00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.470
I would to God my heart were flint like Edward's

615
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:04.070
or Edward's soft and pitiful like mine.

616
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.430
I am too childish-foolish for this world.

617
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:12.870
My lord of Gloucester, in those busy days

618
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:15.500
which here you urge to prove us enemies,

619
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:19.330
we followed then our lord, our sovereign king.

620
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.270
So should we you, if you should be our king.

621
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:22.370
If I should be?

622
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:23.800
I'd rather be a peddler.

623
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.200
Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof.

624
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.570
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose you should enjoy

625
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:29.970
were you this country's king,

626
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:31.600
as little joy you may suppose in me

627
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.530
that I enjoy being the queen thereof.

628
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:37.100
Aye, little joy enjoys the queen thereof,

629
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.800
for I am she and altogether joyless.

630
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.530
I can no longer hold me patient.

631
00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:46.700
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out

632
00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.330
in sharing that that you have pilled from me.

633
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:53.530
Which of you trembles not that looks on me

634
00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:57.130
if not that I am queen, you bow like subjects,

635
00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:00.970
yet that by you deposed, you quake like rebels?

636
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:04.430
Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away.

637
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:07.030
Foul wrinkled witch, what mak'st thou in my sight?

638
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.200
But repetition of what thou hast marred.

639
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.130
That will I make before I let thee go.

640
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.430
Wert thou not banished on pain of death?

641
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:18.770
I was, but I do find more pain in banishment

642
00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:22.370
than death can yield me here by my abode.

643
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:26.870
A husband and a son thou owest me.

644
00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:31.600
And thou a kingdom.

645
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.800
All of you, allegiance.

646
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.070
This sorrow that I have by right is yours,

647
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:41.730
and all the pleasures you usurp are mine.

648
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.970
The curse my noble father laid on thee

649
00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:46.730
when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper,

650
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:49.400
and with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,

651
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.130
and then to dry them gavest the duke a clout

652
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:55.030
steeped in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--

653
00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:58.570
His curses then from bitterness of soul denounced against thee

654
00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:00.070
are all fallen upon thee.

655
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:03.400
And God, not we, have plagued thy bloody deed.

656
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.930
So just is God to right the innocent.

657
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:08.170
O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe

658
00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:10.000
and the most merciless that e'er was heard of!

659
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.170
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.

660
00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:14.370
No man but prophesied revenge for it.

661
00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.970
Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.

662
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:19.230
What?

663
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.730
Were you snarling all before I came,

664
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.100
ready to catch each other by the throat

665
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:29.730
and turn you all your hatred now on me?

666
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:33.870
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with Heaven

667
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:38.100
that Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,

668
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:42.000
their kingdom's loss, my woeful banishment

669
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.500
should all but answer for that peevish brat?

670
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.030
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter Heaven?

671
00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:54.070
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!

672
00:32:56.170 --> 00:33:01.530
Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,

673
00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:05.230
as ours by murder to make him a king.

674
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.970
Edward, thy son, that now is Prince of Wales,

675
00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:15.030
for Edward, my son, that was Prince of Wales,

676
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:20.230
die in his youth by like untimely violence.

677
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:25.770
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,

678
00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.700
outlive thy glory, like my wretched self.

679
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:33.700
Long mayest thou live to wail thy children's death,

680
00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.130
and see another, as I see thee now,

681
00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:40.430
decked in thy rights as thou art stalled in mine.

682
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:45.230
Long die thy happy days before thy death,

683
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:50.000
and after many lengthened hours of grief,

684
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.430
die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen.

685
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:58.270
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by.

686
00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:02.470
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings,

687
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:06.770
when my son was stabbed with bloody daggers.

688
00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.300
God, I pray him

689
00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.100
that none of you may live his natural age

690
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.800
but by some unlooked accident cut off!

691
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.130
Have done thy charm, thou hateful, withered hag!

692
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:18.330
And leave out thee?

693
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:22.100
Stay, dog! For thou shalt hear me.

694
00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:28.530
If heaven have any grievous plague in store

695
00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:32.070
exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,

696
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:35.370
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,

697
00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:38.800
and then hurl down their indignation on thee,

698
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.800
the troubler of the poor world's peace.

699
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:48.100
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul.

700
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:53.670
Thy friends suspect for traitors whilst thou lives

701
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:57.930
and take deep traitors for thy dearest friends.

702
00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:01.630
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,

703
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:05.100
unless it be whilst some tormenting dream affrights thee

704
00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.030
with a hell of ugly devils.

705
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:15.070
O, thou elfish-marked, abortive, rooting hog!

706
00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.500
Thou that wast sealed in thy nativity

707
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.830
the slave of nature and the son of hell!

708
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:25.800
Ah, slander of thy heavy mother's womb!

709
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.370
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!

710
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:32.030
Thou rag of honor! Thou detested--

711
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.030
Margaret!

712
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.030
Richard!

713
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.030
Huh?

714
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:36.130
I call thee not.

715
00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:37.500
I cry thee mercy, then, for I did think

716
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.370
that thou hadst called me all these bitter names.

717
00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.870
Why, so I did, but looked for no reply.

718
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:43.730
O, let me make the period to my curse!

719
00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.200
'Tis done by me and ends in Margaret.

720
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.730
Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.

721
00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:53.930
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune.

722
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:57.400
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,

723
00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.900
whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?

724
00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.130
Fool, fool!

725
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:04.700
Thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.

726
00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.130
The day will come that thou shalt wish for me

727
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:11.230
to help thee curse this poisonous bunchbacked toad.

728
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.700
False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,

729
00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:15.900
lest to thy harm thou move our patience.

730
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.130
Foul shame upon you!

731
00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.500
You have all moved mine!

732
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.400
Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.

733
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.070
To serve me well, you all should do me duty.

734
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:29.930
Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects.

735
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:33.670
O, to serve me well, teach yourselves that duty.

736
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.530
Peace, please, for shame if not for charity.

737
00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:39.570
Urge neither charity nor shame to me!

738
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:42.770
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,

739
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:47.530
and shamefully my hopes by you are butchered.

740
00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:53.600
My charity is outrage; life, my shame.

741
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.200
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage!

742
00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.200
Have done, have done.

743
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.530
O princely Buckingham.

744
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:06.370
I kiss thy hand in sign of league and amity with thee.

745
00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:09.770
Now fair befall thee and thy noble house.

746
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:12.470
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,

747
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:14.300
nor thou within the compass of my curse.

748
00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:15.570
Nor no one here,

749
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:17.130
for curses never pass

750
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:19.300
the lips of those that breathe them in the air.

751
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:26.130
I will but think that they ascend the sky

752
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:31.370
and there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.

753
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:35.500
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!

754
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.730
Look, when he fawns, he bites.

755
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.900
And when he bites, his venom tooth will rankle to the death.

756
00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.830
Have naught to do with him. Beware of him.

757
00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:45.330
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,

758
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.830
and all their ministers, they attend on him.

759
00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.130
What doth she say, my lord of Buckingham?

760
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:56.070
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.

761
00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:59.670
What?

762
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:05.170
Dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel

763
00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:08.400
and soothe the devil that I warn thee from?

764
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:13.000
O, remember this another day,

765
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.670
when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,

766
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:21.570
and say poor Margaret was a prophetess.

767
00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:28.670
Live, each of you,

768
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:32.670
the subjects to his hate

769
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:36.970
and he to yours

770
00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:40.100
and all of you to God's.

771
00:38:56.530 --> 00:39:00.800
My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.

772
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.130
And so doth mine.

773
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:05.530
I muse why she's at liberty.

774
00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:09.870
I cannot blame her.

775
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:13.570
By God's holy mother, she hath had too much wrong,

776
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:17.330
and I repent my part thereof that I have done to her.

777
00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:19.600
I never did her any, to my knowledge.

778
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.830
Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.

779
00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:24.270
I was too hot to do somebody good

780
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:26.430
that is too cold in thinking of it now.

781
00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:30.730
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid.

782
00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:34.070
He is franked up to fatting for his pains.

783
00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:37.230
God pardon them that are the cause thereof.

784
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:39.800
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,

785
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.200
to pray for them that have done scathe to us.

786
00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.630
So do I ever, being well-advised,

787
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.570
for had I cursed now, I'd curse myself.

788
00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:49.170
Madam, his majesty doth call for you

789
00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.800
and for your grace and you, my gracious lords.

790
00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.970
Catesby, I come.

791
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:54.030
Lords, will you go with me?

792
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:55.270
We wait upon your grace.

793
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:05.500
I do the wrong and first begin to brawl.

794
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.530
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach,

795
00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.570
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.

796
00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.500
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have cast in darkness,

797
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.930
I do beweep to many simple gulls--

798
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:17.430
namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham--

799
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:20.300
and tell them 'tis the queen and her allies

800
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.100
that stir the king against the duke my brother.

801
00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.030
Now they believe it and withal whet me

802
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:29.500
to be revenged on Rivers, Dorset, Grey.

803
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.300
But then I sigh and with a piece of scripture,

804
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:36.100
tell them that God bids us do good for evil,

805
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.900
and thus I clothe my naked villainy

806
00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.400
with odd old ends stolen forth of holy writ

807
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.130
and seem a saint when most I play the Devil.

808
00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.000
But soft. Here come my executioners.

809
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:55.870
How now, my hardy, stout, resolved mates.

810
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:57.870
Are you now going to dispatch this thing?

811
00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:59.730
We are, my lord, and come to have the warrant

812
00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.600
that we may be admitted where he is.

813
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.900
Well thought upon; I have it here about me.

814
00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.670
When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.

815
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:15.900
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution, withal obdurate.

816
00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.600
Do not hear him plead,

817
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.370
for Clarence is well-spoken

818
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:21.070
and perhaps may move your hearts to pity

819
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:22.070
if you mark him.

820
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:23.170
Tut, tut, my lord.

821
00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:24.870
We will not stand to prate.

822
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.870
Talkers are no good doers.

823
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:33.270
Be assured we go to use our hands, not our tongues.

824
00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:39.230
Your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes fall tears.

825
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.270
I like you, lads.

826
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.570
About your business, straight.

827
00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:46.930
Go, go; dispatch.

828
00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:48.570
We will, my noble lord.

829
00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.170
Why looks your grace so heavily today?

830
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.800
O, I have passed a miserable night...

831
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:19.900
so full of fearful dreams and ugly sights

832
00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.800
that, as I am a Christian faithful man,

833
00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.630
I would not spend another such a night

834
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.100
though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,

835
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.270
so full of dismal terror was the time.

836
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:31.000
What was your dream, my lord?

837
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.200
I pray you, tell it.

838
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:37.900
Methought that I had broken from the Tower

839
00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.670
and was embark'd to cross to Burgundy.

840
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:43.900
And in my company, my brother Gloucester,

841
00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.900
who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches.

842
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:51.570
Thence we looked toward England

843
00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:53.670
and cited up a thousand heavy times

844
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.230
during the wars of York and Lancaster

845
00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:56.770
that had befallen us.

846
00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:02.200
As we paced along upon the giddy footing of the hatches,

847
00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.230
methought that Gloucester stumbled

848
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:06.830
and in falling, struck me, that thought to stay him,

849
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:09.730
overboard into the tumbling billows of the main.

850
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:15.230
"O Lord," methought, "what pain it was to drown."

851
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:18.430
What dreadful noise of waters in my ears.

852
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:22.030
What sights of ugly death within my eyes.

853
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:26.430
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,

854
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:30.100
ten thousand men that fishes gnawed upon,

855
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:33.930
wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,

856
00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:36.500
inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,

857
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.900
all scattered in the bottom of the sea.

858
00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.700
Some lay in dead men's skulls.

859
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.370
And in the holes where eyes did once inhabit,

860
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:49.700
there were crept, as 'twere, in scorn of eyes,

861
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:54.600
reflecting gems that wooed the slimy bottom of the deep

862
00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.970
and mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by.

863
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.700
Had you such leisure in the time of death

864
00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.730
to gaze upon these secrets of the deep?

865
00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:04.930
Methought I had,

866
00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:07.930
and often did I strive to yield the ghost,

867
00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:11.030
but still the envious flood stopped in my soul

868
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:12.200
and would not let it forth

869
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.470
to find the empty, vast, and wandering air

870
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:16.730
but smothered it within my panting bulk,

871
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:18.370
which almost burst to belch it in the sea.

872
00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:20.230
Awaked you not in this sore agony?

873
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:22.770
No, no, my dream was lengthened after life.

874
00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:28.870
O, then began the tempest to my soul.

875
00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:36.030
I passed, methought, the melancholy flood

876
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:38.770
with that sour ferryman which poets write of

877
00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:42.230
unto the kingdom of perpetual night.

878
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:47.430
The first that there did greet my stranger soul

879
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:50.000
was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,

880
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.100
who spake aloud, "What scourge for perjury

881
00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:00.200
can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?"

882
00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.700
And so he vanished.

883
00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:08.370
Then came wandering by a shadow like an angel

884
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.170
with bright hair dabbled in blood,

885
00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:14.200
and he shrieked out aloud,

886
00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.730
"Clarence is come,

887
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:20.070
"false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,

888
00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:22.630
"that stabbed me in the field by Tewksbury.

889
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:27.300
Seize on him, Furies. Take him unto torment!"

890
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.430
With that, methought,

891
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:30.600
a legion of foul fiends environed me

892
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.870
and howled in mine ears such hideous cries

893
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:35.030
that with the very noise, I trembling waked,

894
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:38.500
and for a season after could not believe but that I was in hell,

895
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.700
such terrible impression made my dream.

896
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.030
No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you.

897
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:46.530
I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.

898
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:48.900
Keeper, keeper, I have done these things

899
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.500
that now give evidence against my soul, for Edward's sake.

900
00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.900
And see how he requites me!

901
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:58.630
O God!

902
00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:00.370
If my deep prayers cannot appease thee,

903
00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:03.230
but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,

904
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:05.770
yet execute thy wrath in me alone.

905
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:11.170
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children.

906
00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:27.470
Keeper, I prithee, sit by me awhile.

907
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:31.030
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.

908
00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.570
I will, my lord.

909
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.670
God give your grace good rest.

910
00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:31.200
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,

911
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.830
makes the night morning and the noontide night.

912
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.530
Princes have but their titles for their glories,

913
00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:46.300
an outward honor for an inward toil.

914
00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.870
And for unfelt imaginations,

915
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:52.230
they often feel a world of restless cares,

916
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:59.200
so that between their titles and low name,

917
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.870
there's nothing differs but the outward fame.

918
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:03.100
How?

919
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.270
Who's here?

920
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:06.730
What wouldst thou, fellow?

921
00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:07.970
How cam'st thou hither?

922
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:09.470
I would speak with Clarence,

923
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:11.700
and I came hither on me legs.

924
00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.300
What?

925
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.200
So brief?

926
00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.100
'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious.

927
00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.830
Let him see our commission, and talk no more.

928
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.830
I am in this commanded to deliver

929
00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:48.600
the noble duke of Clarence to your hands.

930
00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.470
I will not reason what is meant hereby

931
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.370
because I will be guiltless from the meaning.

932
00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:02.470
There lies the duke asleep.

933
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:05.700
There are the keys.

934
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:13.700
I'll to the king and signify to him

935
00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:16.400
that thus I have resigned to you my charge.

936
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.000
You may, sir.

937
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.630
'Tis a point of wisdom.

938
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:28.370
Fare you well?

939
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:35.130
What? Shall I stab him as he sleeps?

940
00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:37.470
No.

941
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:40.070
For he'll say 'twas done cowardly when he wakes.

942
00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:43.370
Why, he shall never wake until the great judgment day.

943
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:46.270
Why, then he'll say we stabbed him sleeping.

944
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:50.370
The urging of that word "judgment"

945
00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:52.500
hath bred a kind of remorse in me.

946
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.400
What? Art thou afraid?

947
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.300
Not to kill him, having a warrant,

948
00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.930
but to be damned for killing him,

949
00:50:57.930 --> 00:50:59.830
from the which no warrant can defend me.

950
00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:01.500
I thought thou hadst been resolute.

951
00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.530
So I am, to let him live.

952
00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:10.300
I'll back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so.

953
00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:14.170
Hey, I pray thee, stay a little.

954
00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:17.630
I hope this passionate humor of mine will change.

955
00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:22.170
It was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty.

956
00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:26.230
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

957
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:28.830
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,

958
00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:31.370
sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,

959
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:34.770
nineteen, twenty.

960
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:39.570
How dost thou feel thyself now?

961
00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:42.700
Some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me.

962
00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.970
Remember our reward when the deed's done.

963
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:48.700
Zounds, he dies!

964
00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.500
I had forgot the reward.

965
00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.370
Where is thy conscience now?

966
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:54.530
O, in the duke of Gloucester's purse.

967
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:57.070
When he opens his purse to give us our reward,

968
00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:58.230
thy conscience flies out.

969
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:59.730
'Tis no matter. Let it go.

970
00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:03.070
There's few or none will entertain it.

971
00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:05.730
Or if it come to thee again?

972
00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:06.970
I'll not meddle with it.

973
00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:09.430
It makes a man a coward.

974
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:12.770
A man cannot steal but it accuseth him.

975
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:15.500
A man cannot swear but it checks him.

976
00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.030
A man cannot lie with his neighbor's wife

977
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:19.730
but it detects him.

978
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:22.770
'Tis a blushing, shamefaced spirit

979
00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:24.570
that mutinies in a man's bosom.

980
00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:27.470
It fills a man full of obstacles.

981
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:30.530
It made me once restore a purse of gold

982
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:33.100
that by chance I found.

983
00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:34.970
It beggars any man that keeps it.

984
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:36.630
It is turned out of towns and cities

985
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:37.930
for a dangerous thing,

986
00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:40.230
and every man that means to live well

987
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:43.270
endeavors to trust to himself and live without it.

988
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:45.270
'Zounds.

989
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:48.000
'Tis is even now at my elbow,

990
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.100
persuading me not to kill the duke.

991
00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:54.070
Take the devil in thy mind, and believe him not.

992
00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:56.730
He would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.

993
00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:59.100
Tut, I am strong-framed.

994
00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.430
He cannot prevail with me.

995
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:03.870
Spoke like a tall man that respects our reputation.

996
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:06.530
Come, shall we fall to work?

997
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:12.770
Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword

998
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:16.300
and then throw him in the malmsey-butt in the next room.

999
00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:18.300
O excellent devise!

1000
00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:19.970
And make a sop of him.

1001
00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:25.930
Hark.

1002
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:28.900
He wakes.

1003
00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:30.270
Strike now?

1004
00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:34.000
We'll reason with him.

1005
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Where art thou, keeper?

1006
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.300
Give me a cup of wine.

1007
00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:41.170
You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.

1008
00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:42.600
In God's name, what art thou?

1009
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.270
A man, as you are.

1010
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:47.970
But not, as I am, royal.

1011
00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:50.630
Nor you, as we are, loyal.

1012
00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:57.570
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.

1013
00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:03.070
My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.

1014
00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:06.330
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak.

1015
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:12.000
Your eyes do menace me.

1016
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.470
Why look you pale?

1017
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:16.300
Who sent you hither?

1018
00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.330
Wherefore do you come?

1019
00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:18.330
To--

1020
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:22.970
To--

1021
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:26.200
To murder me?

1022
00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.370
Aye. Aye.

1023
00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:30.200
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so

1024
00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.130
and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.

1025
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:35.870
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?

1026
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:39.330
Offended us you have not but the king.

1027
00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:41.200
I shall be reconciled to him again.

1028
00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:44.370
Never, my lord. Therefore, prepare to die.

1029
00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:46.800
Are you drawn forth among a world of men

1030
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.270
to slay the innocent?

1031
00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:52.300
What is my offense?

1032
00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.870
Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?

1033
00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:58.400
What lawful quest have given their verdict up

1034
00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.830
unto the frowning judge?

1035
00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:01.600
Or who pronounced the bitter sentence

1036
00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.830
of poor Clarence death?

1037
00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:07.900
Before I be convict by course of law,

1038
00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:11.600
to threaten me with death is most unlawful.

1039
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.530
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption

1040
00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:17.270
by Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,

1041
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:19.900
that you depart and lay no hands on me.

1042
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.970
The deed you undertake is damnable.

1043
00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:24.600
What we will do, we do upon command.

1044
00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.030
And he that hath commanded is our king.

1045
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:28.700
Erroneous vassals!

1046
00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.330
The great King of kings hath in the table of his law

1047
00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:33.570
commanded that thou shalt do no murder.

1048
00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:37.730
Will you then spurn at his edict and fulfill a man's?

1049
00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:41.030
Take heed, for he holds vengeance in his hand

1050
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:43.330
to hurl upon their heads that break his law.

1051
00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:46.030
And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee

1052
00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:48.300
for false forswearing and for murder too.

1053
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.700
Thou didst receive the sacrament

1054
00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.730
to fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.

1055
00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:53.600
And like a traitor to the name of God

1056
00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.700
didst break that vow

1057
00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:56.330
and with thy treacherous blade

1058
00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:58.370
unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.

1059
00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:00.770
Whom thou was sworn to cherish and defend.

1060
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:03.100
How can thou urge God's dreadful law to us,

1061
00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.830
when thou hast broke it in such dear degree?

1062
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:07.030
Alas, for whose sake did I that ill deed?

1063
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.730
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.

1064
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:10.670
He sends you not to murder me for this,

1065
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:12.830
for in that sin, he is as deep as I.

1066
00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:15.070
If God will be avenged for the deed,

1067
00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:17.400
O, know you yet, he does it publicly.

1068
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.930
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm.

1069
00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:22.500
He needs no indirect or lawless course

1070
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.770
to cut off those that have offended him.

1071
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:26.270
Who made thee, then, a bloody minister

1072
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:29.100
when gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,

1073
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:31.570
that princely novice, was struck dead by thee?

1074
00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:33.330
My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.

1075
00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:35.930
Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault

1076
00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:38.430
provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.

1077
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:40.700
Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me.

1078
00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:43.400
I am his brother, and I love him well.

1079
00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.730
If you are hired for meed, go back again,

1080
00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:47.070
and I will send you to my brother Gloucester,

1081
00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:48.730
who shall reward you better for my life

1082
00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:50.070
than Edward will for tidings of my death.

1083
00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:51.300
You are deceived.

1084
00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:52.870
Your brother Gloucester hates you.

1085
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:55.330
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.

1086
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:56.370
Go you to him from me.

1087
00:56:56.370 --> 00:56:57.370
Aye, so we will.

1088
00:56:57.370 --> 00:56:59.430
Tell him when that our princely father York

1089
00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:01.300
blessed his three sons with his victorious arm

1090
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.900
and charged us from his soul to love each other,

1091
00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:05.930
he little thought of this divided friendship.

1092
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:08.500
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.

1093
00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.700
Ah, millstones, as he lessoned us to weep.

1094
00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.470
O, do not slander him, for he is kind!

1095
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:16.800
Right, as snow in harvest.

1096
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.970
Come, you deceive yourself.

1097
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:22.500
'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.

1098
00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.070
It cannot be,

1099
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:25.570
for he bewept my fortune

1100
00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:27.470
and hugged me in his arms and swore with sobs

1101
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:28.830
that he would labor my delivery.

1102
00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:30.230
Why, so he doth,

1103
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:31.970
when he delivers you from this earth's thralldom

1104
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:33.470
to the joys of Heaven.

1105
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:35.830
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.

1106
00:57:38.370 --> 00:57:39.770
Have you that holy feeling in your souls

1107
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:42.070
to counsel me to make my peace with God,

1108
00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:45.800
and are you yet to your own soul so blind

1109
00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:48.330
that you will war with God by murdering me?

1110
00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:51.970
Oh, sirs, consider.

1111
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:54.470
They that set you on to do this deed

1112
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:56.330
will hate you for the deed.

1113
00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:00.230
What shall we do?

1114
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.830
Relent, and save your souls.

1115
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.200
Relent.

1116
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.700
No, 'tis cowardly and womanish.

1117
00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:10.800
Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.

1118
00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.700
Which of you, if you were a prince's son

1119
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:14.470
being pent from liberty as I am now,

1120
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:15.930
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you

1121
00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:17.270
would not entreat for life?

1122
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:20.170
Ah, you would beg, were you in my distress.

1123
00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:22.900
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks.

1124
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.100
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,

1125
00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.900
come thou on my side and entreat for me.

1126
00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:27.900
A begging prince, what beggar pities not?

1127
00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:29.170
Look behind you, my lord!

1128
00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:31.800
Take that.

1129
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.530
And that.

1130
00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:39.070
And if all this will not do,

1131
00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:41.470
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.

1132
00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:59.200
A bloody deed, and desperately dispatched.

1133
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.570
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands

1134
00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:03.600
of this most grievous murder.

1135
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:06.130
How now.

1136
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:08.070
What mean'st thou, that thou helped me not?

1137
00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:11.330
The duke shall know how slack you have been.

1138
00:59:11.330 --> 00:59:13.330
I would he knew that I had saved his brother.

1139
00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:15.170
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say,

1140
00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:17.670
for I repent me that the duke is slain!

1141
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:19.600
Go, coward, as thou art!

1142
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:23.830
Well.

1143
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.930
I'll go hide the body in some hole

1144
00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:31.300
till that the duke give order for his burial.

1145
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:34.970
And when I have my meed, I will away,

1146
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:39.730
for this will out, and then I must not stay.

1147
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
