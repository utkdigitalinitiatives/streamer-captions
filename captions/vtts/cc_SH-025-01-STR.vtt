00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:54.570


2
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.970
Hey! Hey!

3
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.900
Hey! Hey!

4
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.700
Hey! Hey!

5
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.430
Now is the winter of ourdiscontent

6
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.630
made glorious summer bythis son of York.

7
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.200
And all the clouds thatlowered upon our house

8
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.730
in the deep bosom of theocean buried.

9
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.930
Now are our brows boundwith victorious wreaths,

10
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.900
our bruised arms hung upfor monuments,

11
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.300
our stern alarums changedto merry meetings,

12
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.200
our dreadful marches todelightful measures.

13
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.870
Grim-visaged war hathsmoothed his wrinkledfront,

14
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.370
and now, instead ofmounting barbed steeds

15
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.900
to fright the souls offearful adversaries,

16
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.170
he capers nimbly in alady's chamber

17
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.170
to the lascivious pleasingof a lute.

18
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.670
But I, that am not shapedfor sportive tricks

19
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.670
nor made to court anamorous looking glass;

20
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.830
I, that am rudely stamped

21
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.030
and want love's majesty tostrut before a wantonambling nymph;

22
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.170
I, that am curtailed ofthis fair proportion,

23
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.030
cheated of feature bydissembling nature,

24
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.870
deformed, unfinished,

25
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.770
sent before my time intothis breathing world

26
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.470
scarce half made up,

27
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.030
and that so lamely andunfashionable

28
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.230
that dogs bark at me as Ihalt by them--

29
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.330
why I, in this weak pipingtime of peace

30
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.300
have no delight to passaway the time,

31
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.900
unless to spy my shadow inthe sun

32
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.400
and descant on my owndeformity.

33
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.900
And therefore, since Icannot prove a lover

34
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.900
to entertain these fairwell-spoken days,

35
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.200
I am determined to prove avillain

36
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.470
and hate the idlepleasures of these days.

37
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.370
Plots have I laid,inductions dangerous,

38
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.030
by drunken prophecies,libels, and dreams,

39
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.770
to set my brother Clarenceand the king in deadly hate

40
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.370
the one against the other.

41
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.770
And if King Edward be astrue and just

42
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.100
as I am subtle, false, andtreacherous,

43
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.070
this day should Clarenceclosely be mewed up

44
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.300
about a prophecy whichsays

45
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.070
that G of Edward's heirsthe murderer shall be.

46
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.230
Dive, thoughts, down to mysoul.

47
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.070
Here Clarence comes.

48
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.500
Brother, good day.

49
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.900
What means this armed guardthat waits upon your grace?

50
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.270
His majesty, tendering myperson's safety,

51
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.900
hath appointed thisconduct to convey me tothe Tower.

52
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.030
Upon what cause?

53
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.500
Because my name is George.

54
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.070
Alack, my lord, that faultis none of yours.

55
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.870
He should for that commityour godfathers.

56
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.370
Oh, belike his majestyhath some intent

57
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.830
that you shall benew-christened in the Tower.

58
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.000
What's the matter,Clarence?

59
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.100
May I know?

60
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.600
Yea, Richard, when I know,

61
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.770
for I protest, as yet I donot.

62
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.430
But as I can learn, hehearkens after propheciesand dreams

63
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.700
and from the cross-rowplucks the letter G

64
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.430
and says a wizard told him

65
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.870
that by G his issuedisinherited should be.

66
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.170
And, for my name of Georgebegins with G,

67
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.330
it follows in his thoughtthat I am he.

68
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.970
These, as I learn, andsuch like toys as these

69
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.130
have moved his highness tocommit me now.

70
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.170
Why, this it is, when menare ruled by women.

71
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.500
'Tis not the king thatsends you to the Tower.

72
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.230
My Lady Grey, his wife,Clarence;

73
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.870
'tis she that tempers himto this extremity.

74
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.130
Was it not she and thatgood man of worship,

75
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.130
Anthony Woodville, herbrother there,

76
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.370
that made him send LordHastings to the Tower,

77
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.730
from whence this presentday he is delivered?

78
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.930
We are not safe, Clarence.

79
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.170
We are not safe.

80
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.730
By heaven, I think thereis no man secure

81
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.230
but the queen's kindredand night-walking heralds

82
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.600
that trudge betwixt theking and Mistress Shore.

83
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.070
Heard ye not what anhumble suppliant

84
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.100
Lord Hastings was to herfor his delivery?

85
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.970
Humbly complaining to herdeity

86
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.230
got my lord chamberlainhis liberty.

87
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.400
I'll tell you what.

88
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.770
I think it is our way,

89
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.370
if we will keep in favorwith the king,

90
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.930
to be her men and wear herlivery.

91
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.700
The jealous o'erworn widowand herself,

92
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.630
since that our brotherdubbed them gentlewomen,

93
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.970
are mighty gossips in ourmonarchy.

94
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.230
I beseech your graces bothto pardon me.

95
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.670
His majesty hath straitlygiven in charge

96
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.000
that no man shall haveprivate conference

97
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.670
of what degree soever withhis brother.

98
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.370
Even so, and it pleaseyour worship, Brakenbury,

99
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.430
you may partake ofanything we say.

100
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.400
We speak no treason, man.

101
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.000
We say the king is wiseand virtuous

102
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.930
and his noble queen wellstruck in years, fair, andnot jealous.

103
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.700
We say that Shore's wifehath a pretty foot, acherry lip,

104
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.730
a bonny eye, a passingpleasing tongue,

105
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.970
and that the queen's kindredare made gentle-folk.

106
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.770
Now how say you, sir?

107
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.000
Can you deny all this?

108
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.630
With this, my lord, myselfhave naught to do.

109
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.000
Naught with MistressShore?

110
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.670
I tell thee, fellow,

111
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.730
he that doth naught withher, excepting one,

112
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.530
were best to do itsecretly, alone.

113
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.100
What one, my lord?

114
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.830
Her husband, knave.Wouldst thou betray me?

115
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.070
I do beseech your grace topardon me

116
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.200
and withal forbear yourconference with the noble duke.

117
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.600
We know thy charge,Brakenbury, and will obey.

118
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.270
We are the queen's objectsand must obey.

119
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.470
Brother, farewell.

120
00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.800
I will unto the king.

121
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.000
And whatsoe'er you willemploy me in,

122
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.400
were it to call KingEdward's widow sister,

123
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.070
I will perform it toenfranchise you.

124
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.100
Meantime, this deepdisgrace in brotherhood

125
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.570
touches me deeper than youcan imagine.

126
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.870
I know it pleaseth neitherof us well.

127
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.930
Well, your imprisonmentshall not be long.

128
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.100
I will deliver you or elselie for you.

129
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.470
Meantime, have patience.

130
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.230
I must, perforce.

131
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:30.700
Farewell.

132
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.830
Go; tread the path thatthou shalt ne'er return.

133
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.830
Simple, plain Clarence.

134
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.200
I do love thee so

135
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.870
that I will shortly sendthy soul to heaven,

136
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.630
if heaven will take thepresent at our hands.

137
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.630
But who comes here?

138
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.270
The new-deliveredHastings.

139
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.000
Good time of day unto mygracious lord.

140
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.700
As much unto my good lordchamberlain.

141
00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.800
Well are you welcome tothe open air.

142
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.570
How hath your lordshipbrooked imprisonment?

143
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.300
With patience, noble lord,as prisoners must.

144
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.800
But I shall live, my lord,to give them thanks

145
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.600
that were the cause of myimprisonment.

146
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.470
No doubt, no doubt, and soshall Clarence too,

147
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.100
for they that were yourenemies are his

148
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.070
and have prevailed as muchon him as you.

149
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.200
More pity that the eagleshould be mewed

150
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.630
while kites and buzzardsprey at liberty.

151
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.030
What news abroad?

152
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.730
No news so bad abroad asthis at home.

153
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.870
The king is sickly, weak,melancholy,

154
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.530
and his physicians fearhim mightily.

155
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.800
Now, by Saint John, thatnews is bad indeed.

156
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.430
O, he hath kept an evildiet long

157
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.870
and overmuch consumed hisroyal person.

158
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.970
'Tis very grievous to bethought upon.

159
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.900
Where is he, in his bed?

160
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.270
He is.

161
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.270
Go you before, and I willfollow you.

162
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.400
He cannot live, I hope,and must not die

163
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.570
till George be packed withpost-horse up to heaven.

164
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.700
I'll in, to urge hishatred more to Clarence

165
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.100
with lies well steeledwith weighty arguments.

166
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.530
And if I fail not in mydeep intent,

167
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.930
Clarence hath not anotherday to live;

168
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.630
which done, God take KingEdward to his mercy

169
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.530
and leave the world for meto bustle in,

170
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.270
for then I'll marryWarwick's youngest daughter.

171
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.800
What though I killed herhusband and her father?

172
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.300
The readiest way to makethe wench amends

173
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.770
is to become her husbandand her father,

174
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.400
the which will I,

175
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.200
not all so much for loveas for another secretclose intent,

176
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.970
by marrying her which Imust reach unto.

177
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.600
But yet I run before myhorse to market.

178
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.600
Clarence still breathes.

179
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.270
Edward still lives andreigns.

180
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.600
When they are gone, thenmust I count my gain.

181
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.200
Set down, set down yourhonorable load,

182
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.130
if honor may be shroudedin a hearse,

183
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.200
whilst I awhileobsequiously lament

184
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.770
the untimely fall ofvirtuous Lancaster.

185
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.870
Poor key-cold figure of aholy king,

186
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.230
pale ashes of the house ofLancaster,

187
00:10:54.230 --> 00:11:00.300
thou bloodless remnant ofthat royal blood.

188
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.170
Be it lawful that Iinvocate thy ghost

189
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.300
to hear the lamentationsof poor Anne,

190
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.530
wife to thy Edward, to thyslaughtered son,

191
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:17.300
stabbed by the selfsame handthat made these wounds.

192
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:23.000
Lo, in these windows thatlet forth thy life,

193
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.330
I pour the helpless balmof my poor eyes.

194
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:34.400
O, cursed be the hand thatmade these holes,

195
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.170
cursed the heart that hadthe heart to do it,

196
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:43.730
cursed the blood that letthis blood from hence.

197
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.400
More direful hap betidethat hated wretch

198
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.070
that makes us wretched bythe death of thee

199
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.400
than I can wish to adders,spiders, toads,

200
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.670
or any creeping venomedthing that lives.

201
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:02.130
If ever he have child,abortive be it,

202
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.630
prodigious, and untimelybrought to light,

203
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.700
whose ugly and unnaturalaspect

204
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.570
may fright the hopefulmother at the view,

205
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.970
and that be heir to hisunhappiness.

206
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.270
If ever he have wife,

207
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:19.270
let her be made moremiserable by the death of him

208
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.730
than I am made by my younglord and thee.

209
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.270
Come now towards Chertseywith your holy load,

210
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.100
taken from Paul's to beinterred there.

211
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:46.300
Stay, you that bear thecorse, and set it down.

212
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.800
What black magicianconjures up this fiend

213
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.870
to stop devoted charitabledeeds?

214
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.130
Villains, set down thecorse, or, by Saint Paul,

215
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.300
I'll make a corse of himthat disobeys.

216
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.730
My lord, stand back, andlet the coffin pass.

217
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.530
Unmannered dog, standthou, when I command.

218
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.130
Advance thy halberd higherthan my breast,

219
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.130
or, by Saint Paul, I'llstrike thee to my foot

220
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.600
and spurn upon thee,beggar, for thy boldness!

221
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.630
What? Do you tremble?

222
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.500
Are you all afraid?

223
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.400
Alas, I blame you not, foryou are mortal,

224
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.330
and mortal eyes cannotendure the devil.

225
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.030
Avaunt, thou dreadfulminister of hell.

226
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.300
Thou hadst but power overhis mortal body.

227
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.600
His soul thou canst nothave; therefore ,be gone.

228
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.570
Sweet saint, for charity,be not so curst.

229
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.400
Foul devil, for God's sake,hence, and trouble us not,

230
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.830
for thou hast made thehappy earth thy hell,

231
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.830
filled it with cursingcries and deep exclaims.

232
00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.370
If thou delight to viewthy heinous deeds,

233
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.230
behold this pattern of thybutcheries!

234
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:09.500
O, gentlemen, see, see!

235
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.030
Dead Henry's wounds opentheir congealed mouths

236
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.170
and bleed afresh!

237
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.730
Blush, blush, thou lump offoul deformity,

238
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.370
for 'tis thy presence thatexhales this blood

239
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.600
from cold and empty veinswhere no blood dwells.

240
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.500
Thy deed, inhuman andunnatural,

241
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.200
provokes this deluge mostunnatural.

242
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.230
O God, which this bloodmadest,

243
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.700
revenge his death!

244
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.070
O earth, which this blooddrinkest,

245
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.300
revenge his death!

246
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.800
Either heaven with lightningstrike the murderer dead,

247
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.800
or earth, gape open wideand eat him quick,

248
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.200
as thou dost swallow upthis good king's blood,

249
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.270
which his hell-governedarm hath butchered!

250
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.600
Lady, you know no rules ofcharity,

251
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.530
which renders good forbad, blessings for curses.

252
00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.330
Villain, thou knowest nolaw of God nor man.

253
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.970
No beast so fierce butknows some touch of pity.

254
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.230
But I know none andtherefore am no beast.

255
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.170
O wonderful, when devilsspeak the truth!

256
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.270
More wonderful when angelsare so angry.

257
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.530
Vouchsafe, divineperfection of a woman,

258
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.500
of these supposed crimesto give me leave

259
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.070
by circumstance but toacquit myself.

260
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.900
Vouchsafe, defusedinfection of a man,

261
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.200
of these known evils butto give me leave

262
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.000
by circumstance to accusethy cursed self!

263
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.370
Fairer than tongue canname thee.

264
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.830
Let me have some patientleisure to excuse myself.

265
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.630
Fouler than heart canthink thee.

266
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.870
Thou canst make no excusecurrent but to hang thyself!

267
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.830
By such despair, I shouldaccuse myself.

268
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.170
And by despairing shaltthou stand excused

269
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.230
for doing worthy vengeanceon thyself,

270
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.470
that didst unworthyslaughter upon others.

271
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.600
Say that I slew them not.

272
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.330
Then say they were notslain, but dead they are,

273
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.670
and, devilish slave, bythee.

274
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:51.670
I did not kill yourhusband.

275
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.930
Why, then he is alive.

276
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.630
Nay, he is dead, and slainby Edward's hand.

277
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.770
In thy foul throat, thouliest.

278
00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.770
Queen Margaret saw thymurderous falchion smokingin his blood,

279
00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.370
the which thou once didstspend against her breast,

280
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.230
but that thy brothers beataside the point.

281
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.000
I was provoked by herslanderous tongue

282
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.330
that laid their guilt uponmy guiltless shoulders.

283
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.600
Thou wast provoked by thybloody mind,

284
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.270
that never dreamt on aughtbut butcheries.

285
00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.970
Didst thou not kill thisking?

286
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.330
I grant ye, aye.

287
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.830
Dost grant me, hedgehog?

288
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.600
Then God grant me too

289
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.500
thou mayest be damned forthat wicked deed!

290
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.430
O, he was gentle, mild,and virtuous!

291
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.400
The better for the King ofHeaven, that hath him.

292
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.300
He is in heaven, wherethou shalt never come.

293
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.370
Let him thank me that holpto send him thither,

294
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.200
for he was fitter for thatplace than earth.

295
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.200
And thou unfit for anyplace but hell.

296
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.900
Yes, one place else, ifyou will hear me name it.

297
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.900
Some dungeon.

298
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.270
Your bedchamber.

299
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.600
Ill rest betide thechamber where thou liest!

300
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.200
So will it, madam, till Ilie with you.

301
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.300
I hope so.

302
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.230
I know so.

303
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.100
But, gentle Lady Anne,

304
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.900
to leave this keenencounter of our wits

305
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.470
and fall something into aslower method,

306
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.070
is not the causer of thetimeless deaths

307
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.270
of these Plantagenets,Henry and Edward,

308
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.230
as blameful as theexecutioner?

309
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.900
Thou wast the cause andmost accursed effect.

310
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.800
Your beauty was the causeof that effect,

311
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.070
your beauty that did hauntme in my sleep

312
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:16.700
to undertake the death ofall the world

313
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.770
so I might live one hourin your sweet bosom.

314
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.770
If I thought that, I tellthee, homicide,

315
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.500
these nails should rendthat beauty from mycheeks.

316
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.570
These eyes could not endurethat beauty's wreck.

317
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:28.570
You should not blemish itif I stood by.

318
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:31.900
As all the world is cheered bythe sun, so I by that.

319
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.230
It is my day, my life.

320
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.770
Black night o'ershade thyday and death thy life!

321
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.700
Curse not thyself, faircreature; thou art both.

322
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.230
I would I were to berevenged on thee.

323
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.900
It is a quarrel mostunnatural

324
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.530
to be revenged on him thatloveth thee.

325
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.270
It is a quarrel just andreasonable

326
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.030
to be revenged on him thatkilled my husband.

327
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.870
He that bereft thee, lady,of thy husband

328
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.470
did it to help thee to abetter husband.

329
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.600
His better doth notbreathe upon the earth.

330
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.530
He lives that loves theebetter than he could.

331
00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:54.130
Name him.

332
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:54.770
Plantagenet.

333
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:55.770
Why, that was he.

334
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.330
The selfsame name but oneof better nature.

335
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:57.930
Where is he?

336
00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:58.930
Here.

337
00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.770
Why dost thou spit at me?

338
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.130
Would it were mortalpoison, for thy sake.

339
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.300
Never came poison from sosweet a place.

340
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.600
Never hung poison on afouler toad.

341
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.000
Out of my sight! Thou dostinfect mine eyes.

342
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.030
Thine eyes, sweet lady,have infected mine.

343
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.700
Would they were basilisks,to strike thee dead!

344
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.600
I would they were, that Imight die at once,

345
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.800
for now they kill me witha living death.

346
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.330
Those eyes of thine frommine have drawn salt tears,

347
00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.470
shamed their aspects withstore of childish drops.

348
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.430
These eyes, which nevershed remorseful tear,

349
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.100
no, when my father Yorkand Edward wept

350
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.070
to hear the piteous moanthat Rutland made

351
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:38.600
when black-faced Cliffordshook his sword at him

352
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.200
nor when thy warlikefather, like a child,

353
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.770
told the sad story of myfather's death

354
00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.100
and twenty times madepause to sob and weep,

355
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.100
that all the standers-byhad wet their cheeks

356
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.470
like trees bedashed withrain.

357
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.970
In that sad time, my manlyeyes did scorn an humble tear,

358
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.670
and what these sorrowscould not thence exhale,

359
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:00.900
thy beauty hath,

360
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.930
and made them blind withweeping.

361
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.900
I never sued to friend norenemy.

362
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.400
My tongue could never learnsweet smoothing word.

363
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.430
But now thy beauty isproposed my fee,

364
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.330
my proud heart sues andprompts my tongue to speak.

365
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.670
Teach not thy lip suchscorn,

366
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.630
for it was made forkissing, lady,

367
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.700
not for such contempt.

368
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.730
If thy revengeful heartcannot forgive,

369
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.530
lo, here I lend thee thissharp-pointed sword,

370
00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.630
which if thou please tohide in this true breast

371
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.300
and lay the soul forththat adoreth thee,

372
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.300
I lay it naked to thedeadly stroke

373
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.770
and humbly beg the deathupon my knee.

374
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.230
Nay, do not pause, for Idid kill King Henry,

375
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.600
but 'twas thy beauty thatprovoked me.

376
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.800
Nay, now dispatch!

377
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.570
'Twas I that stabbed youngEdward,

378
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.830
but 'twas thy heavenlyface that set me on.

379
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.500
Take up the sword again,or take up me.

380
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.800
Arise, dissembler.

381
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.770
Though I wish thy death, Iwill not be thy executioner.

382
00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.230
Then bid me kill myself,and I will do it.

383
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:56.230
I have already.

384
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.330
That was in thy rage.

385
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.070
Speak it again, and evenwith the word,

386
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.230
this hand, which for thylove did kill thy love,

387
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.730
shall for thy love kill afar truer love.

388
00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.900
To both their deaths thoushalt be accessory.

389
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.070
I would I knew thy heart.

390
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.370
'Tis figured in my tongue.

391
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.870
I fear me both are false.

392
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.500
Then never was man true.

393
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.700
Well, well, put up yoursword.

394
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.030
Say, then, my peace ismade.

395
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.430
That thou shalt knowhereafter.

396
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.100
But shall I live in hope?

397
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.930
All men, I hope, live so.

398
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.930
Vouchsafe to wear thisring.

399
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.570
To take is not to give.

400
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.600
Look how my ringencompasseth thy finger.

401
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.530
Even so, thy breastencloseth my poor heart.

402
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.100
Wear both of them, forboth of them are thine.

403
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.400
And if thy poor, devotedservant

404
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.100
may but beg one favor atthy gracious hand,

405
00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.300
thou dost confirm hishappiness forever.

406
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.900
What is it?

407
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.200
That it may please youleave these sad designs

408
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.970
to him that hath mostcause to be a mourner

409
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.830
and presently repair toCrosby Place,

410
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:12.600
where, after I havesolemnly interred

411
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.170
at Chertsey Monastery thisnoble king

412
00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.330
and wet his grave with myrepentant tears,

413
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.170
I will with all expedientduty see you

414
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.630
for divers unknownreasons.

415
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.370
I beseech you, grant methis boon.

416
00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:32.000
With all my heart, andmuch it joys me too,

417
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.470
to see you are become sopenitent.

418
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.900
Tressel and Berkeley, goalong with me.

419
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.830
Bid me farewell.

420
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:44.270
'Tis more than youdeserve.

421
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.930
But since you teach me howto flatter you,

422
00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:50.100
imagine I have saidfarewell already.

423
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.770
Sirs, take up the corse.

424
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.830
Towards Chertsey, noblelord?

425
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:07.600
No, to Whitefriars; thereattend my coming.

426
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.530
Was ever woman in thishumor wooed?

427
00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.530
Was ever woman in thishumor won?

428
00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.270
I'll have her, but I willnot keep her long.

429
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:29.330
What?

430
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.970
I, that killed her husbandand his father,

431
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.930
to take her in her heart'sextremest hate,

432
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.030
curses in her mouth, tearsin her eyes,

433
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.670
the bleeding witness ofher hatred by;

434
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.700
having God, herconscience, and these barsagainst me,

435
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.700
and I, no friends to backmy suit at all

436
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.600
but the plain devil anddissembling looks,

437
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.870
and yet to win her, allthe world to nothing.

438
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.630
Hath she forgot already thatbrave prince, Edward, her lord,

439
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.670
whom I, some three monthssince,

440
00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.170
stabbed in my angry moodat Tewksbury?

441
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.000
A sweeter and a loveliergentleman,

442
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.500
framed in the prodigalityof nature,

443
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.400
young, valiant, wise, and,no doubt, right royal,

444
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.130
the spacious world cannotagain afford.

445
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.770
And will she yet debaseher eyes on me,

446
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.970
that cropped the goldenprime of this sweet prince

447
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.970
and made her widow to awoeful bed?

448
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:23.700
On me, whose all notequals Edward's moiety?

449
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.600
On me, who halts and ammisshapen thus?

450
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:31.630
My dukedom to a beggarlydenier,

451
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.830
I do mistake my person allthis while.

452
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:37.400
Upon my life, she finds,although I cannot,

453
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.670
myself to be a marvelousproper man.

454
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.170
I'll be at charges for alooking glass

455
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.670
and entertain a score ortwo of tailors

456
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.770
to study fashion to adornmy body.

457
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.970
Since I am crept in favorwith myself,

458
00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.370
I will maintain it at somelittle cost.

459
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.030
But first, I'll turn yonfellow in his grave

460
00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:02.130
and then return, lamentingto my love.

461
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.070
Shine out, fair sun, tillI have bought a glass,

462
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.330
that I might see my shadowas I pass.

463
00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.130
Have patience, sister.

464
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.330
There's no doubt

465
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.000
his majesty will soon recoverhis accustom'd health.

466
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.500
In that you brook it ill,it makes him worse.

467
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.870
Therefore, for God's sake,entertain good comfort,

468
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.900
and cheer his grace withquick and merry eyes.

469
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.000
If he were dead, whatwould betide of me?

470
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.200
No other harm but loss ofsuch a lord.

471
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.130
The loss of such a lordincludes all harms!

472
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:40.770
The heavens have blessedyou with a goodly son

473
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.770
to be your comforter whenhe is gone.

474
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.670
Ah, he is young, and hisminority is put

475
00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.370
unto the trust of RichardGloucester,

476
00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.370
a man who loves not me nornone of you.

477
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.200
Is it concluded he shallbe protector?

478
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.930
It is determined, notconcluded yet,

479
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.230
but so it must be, if theking miscarry.

480
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.330
Here come the lords ofBuckingham and Derby.

481
00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.270
Good time of day unto yourroyal grace.

482
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.400
God make your majestyjoyful as you have been.

483
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.330
The Countess Richmond,good my lord of Derby,

484
00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.230
to your good prayer wouldscarcely say amen.

485
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:14.800
Yet, Derby, notwithstandingshe's your wife

486
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.700
and loves not me, be you,good lord, assured

487
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.700
I hate not you for herproud arrogance.

488
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.800
I do beseech you, eithernot believe

489
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.270
the envious slanders ofher false accusers,

490
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.630
or, if she be accused ontrue report,

491
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.470
bear with her weakness,

492
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.370
which, I think, proceedsfrom wayward sickness

493
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.070
and no grounded malice.

494
00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:39.970
Saw you the king today, mylord of Derby?

495
00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.630
But now the duke ofBuckingham and I

496
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:43.270
are come from visiting hismajesty.

497
00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.030
What likelihood of hisamendment, lords?

498
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.230
Madam, good hope.

499
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.070
His grace speakscheerfully.

500
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.100
God grant him health.

501
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.600
Did you confer with him?

502
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.630
Aye, madam.

503
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.130
He desires to makeatonement

504
00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:55.830
between the duke ofGloucester and your brothers

505
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.900
and between them and mylord chamberlain

506
00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.930
and sent to warn them tohis royal presence.

507
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.370
Would all were well.

508
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.900
But that will never be.

509
00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.230
I fear our happiness is atthe height.

510
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:10.130
They do me wrong, and Iwill not endure it.

511
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.500
Who is it that complainsunto the king

512
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.070
that I, forsooth, am sternand love them not?

513
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.370
By holy Paul, they lovehis grace but lightly

514
00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.300
that fill his ears withsuch dissentious rumors.

515
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.230
Because I cannot flatterand look fair,

516
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:25.600
smile in men's faces,smooth, deceive, and cog,

517
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.000
duck with French nods andapish courtesy,

518
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.900
I must be held a rancorousenemy.

519
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.330
Cannot a plain man liveand think no harm,

520
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.430
but thus his simple truthmust be abused

521
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.330
with silken, sly,insinuating jacks?

522
00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.430
To who in all this presencespeaks your grace?

523
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:44.430
To thee, that hast norhonesty nor grace.

524
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:45.830
When have I injured thee?

525
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.030
When done thee wrong?

526
00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.770
Or thee? Or thee?

527
00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.530
Or any of your faction?

528
00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:51.830
A plague upon you all!

529
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.030
His royal grace,

530
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:54.930
whom God preserve betterthan you would wish,

531
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.070
cannot be quiet scarce abreathing-while

532
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.070
but you must trouble himwith lewd complaints.

533
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:01.170
Brother of Gloucester, youmistake the matter.

534
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.430
The king, on his own royaldisposition

535
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.430
and not provoked by anysuitor else,

536
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:08.030
aiming, belike, at yourinterior hatred

537
00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:09.830
that in your outwardactions shows itself

538
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:12.430
against my children,brothers, and myself,

539
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.700
makes him to send,

540
00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.530
that he may learn theground of your ill will

541
00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:17.270
and thereby to remove it.

542
00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.630
I cannot tell.

543
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.170
The world is grown so bad

544
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.630
that wrens make prey whereeagles dare not perch.

545
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.430
Since every jack became agentleman,

546
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.200
there's many agentleperson made a jack.

547
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.600
Come, come, we know yourmeaning, brother Gloucester.

548
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.200
You envy my advancementand my friends'.

549
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.700
God grant we never mayhave need of you!

550
00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.730
Meantime, God grants thatwe have need of you.

551
00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:42.170
Our brother is imprison'dby your means,

552
00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:43.630
myself disgraced,

553
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:45.400
and the nobility held incontempt,

554
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.430
while great promotions aredaily given

555
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.830
to ennoble those thatscarce some two days since

556
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.030
were worth a noble.

557
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.400
By Him that raised me tothis careful height

558
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.700
from that contented hapwhich I enjoyed,

559
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.870
I never did incense hismajesty against the dukeof Clarence

560
00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.370
but have been an earnestadvocate to plead for him.

561
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.300
My lord, you do meshameful injury

562
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.770
falsely to draw me inthese vile suspects.

563
00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.700
You may deny that you werenot the mean

564
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.900
of my Lord Hastings' lateimprisonment.

565
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:10.900
She may, my lord, for--

566
00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:11.970
She may, Lord Rivers.

567
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.430
Why, who knows not so?

568
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:15.730
She may do more, sir, thandenying that.

569
00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:18.500
She may help you to manyfair preferments

570
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.130
and then deny her aidinghand therein

571
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.070
and lay those honors onyour high desert.

572
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.170
What may she not?

573
00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:25.170
She may. Aye, marry, mayshe.

574
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.700
What, marry, may she?

575
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.200
What, marry, may she?

576
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:32.200
Marry with a king, abachelor, and a handsomestripling too.

577
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.070
I wish your grandam had aworser match.

578
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.870
My lord of Gloucester, Ihave too long borne

579
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.470
your blunt upbraidings andyour bitter scoffs.

580
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:43.770
By Heaven, I will acquainthis majesty

581
00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:46.330
of those gross taunts thatoft I have endured!

582
00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.570
I had rather be a countryservant maid

583
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.200
than a great queen withthis condition

584
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.330
to be so baited, scorned,and stormed at.

585
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:56.030
Small joy have I in beingEngland's queen!

586
00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:59.630
And lessened be thatsmall, God, I beseech Him.

587
00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.200
Thy honor, state, and seatare due to me.

588
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.200
What!

589
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.970
Threat you me with tellingof the king?

590
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:06.400
Tell him, and spare not.

591
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.730
Look, what I have said,

592
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:09.430
I will avouch in presenceof the king.

593
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:12.200
I dare adventure to besent to the Tower.

594
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.700
'Tis time to speak; mypains are quite forgot.

595
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.970
Out, devil!

596
00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:17.870
I remember them too well.

597
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.670
Thou kills't my husbandHenry in the Tower

598
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.100
and Edward, my poor son,at Tewksbury.

599
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.900
Ere you were queen, aye,or your husband king,

600
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.200
I was a packhorse in hisgreat affairs,

601
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.630
a weeder-out of his proudadversaries,

602
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:31.730
a liberal rewarder of hisfriends.

603
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.330
To royalize his blood, Ispent mine own.

604
00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:37.470
Aye, and much better bloodthan his or thine.

605
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.430
Let me put in your minds,if you forget,

606
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:42.000
what you have been erethis and what you are;

607
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.570
withal, what I have beenand what I am.

608
00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:47.970
A murderous villain, andso still thou art.

609
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.230
Poor Clarence did forsakehis father, Warwick.

610
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.830
Aye, and forswore himself,which, Jesu pardon--

611
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.230
Which God revenge.

612
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.130
To fight on Edward's partyfor the crown.

613
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.700
And for his meed, poorlord, he is mew'd up.

614
00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.470
I would to God my heartwere flint like Edward's

615
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:04.070
or Edward's soft andpitiful like mine.

616
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.430
I am too childish-foolishfor this world.

617
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:12.870
My lord of Gloucester, inthose busy days

618
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:15.500
which here you urge toprove us enemies,

619
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:19.330
we followed then our lord,our sovereign king.

620
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.270
So should we you, if youshould be our king.

621
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:22.370
If I should be?

622
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:23.800
I'd rather be a peddler.

623
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.200
Far be it from my heart,the thought thereof.

624
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.570
As little joy, my lord, asyou suppose you should enjoy

625
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:29.970
were you this country'sking,

626
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:31.600
as little joy you maysuppose in me

627
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.530
that I enjoy being thequeen thereof.

628
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:37.100
Aye, little joy enjoys thequeen thereof,

629
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.800
for I am she andaltogether joyless.

630
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.530
I can no longer hold mepatient.

631
00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:46.700
Hear me, you wranglingpirates, that fall out

632
00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.330
in sharing that that youhave pilled from me.

633
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:53.530
Which of you trembles notthat looks on me

634
00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:57.130
if not that I am queen,you bow like subjects,

635
00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:00.970
yet that by you deposed,you quake like rebels?

636
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:04.430
Ah, gentle villain, do notturn away.

637
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:07.030
Foul wrinkled witch, whatmak'st thou in my sight?

638
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.200
But repetition of whatthou hast marred.

639
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.130
That will I make before Ilet thee go.

640
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.430
Wert thou not banished onpain of death?

641
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:18.770
I was, but I do find morepain in banishment

642
00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:22.370
than death can yield mehere by my abode.

643
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:26.870
A husband and a son thouowest me.

644
00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:31.600
And thou a kingdom.

645
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.800
All of you, allegiance.

646
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.070
This sorrow that I have byright is yours,

647
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:41.730
and all the pleasures youusurp are mine.

648
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.970
The curse my noble fatherlaid on thee

649
00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:46.730
when thou didst crown hiswarlike brows with paper,

650
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:49.400
and with thy scorns drew'strivers from his eyes,

651
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.130
and then to dry themgavest the duke a clout

652
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:55.030
steeped in the faultlessblood of pretty Rutland--

653
00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:58.570
His curses then frombitterness of souldenounced against thee

654
00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:00.070
are all fallen upon thee.

655
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:03.400
And God, not we, haveplagued thy bloody deed.

656
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.930
So just is God to rightthe innocent.

657
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:08.170
O, 'twas the foulest deedto slay that babe

658
00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:10.000
and the most mercilessthat e'er was heard of!

659
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.170
Tyrants themselves weptwhen it was reported.

660
00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:14.370
No man but prophesiedrevenge for it.

661
00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.970
Northumberland, thenpresent, wept to see it.

662
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:19.230
What?

663
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.730
Were you snarling allbefore I came,

664
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.100
ready to catch each otherby the throat

665
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:29.730
and turn you all yourhatred now on me?

666
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:33.870
Did York's dread curseprevail so much with Heaven

667
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:38.100
that Henry's death, mylovely Edward's death,

668
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:42.000
their kingdom's loss, mywoeful banishment

669
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.500
should all but answer forthat peevish brat?

670
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.030
Can curses pierce theclouds and enter Heaven?

671
00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:54.070
Why, then, give way, dullclouds, to my quick curses!

672
00:32:56.170 --> 00:33:01.530
Though not by war, bysurfeit die your king,

673
00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:05.230
as ours by murder to makehim a king.

674
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.970
Edward, thy son, that nowis Prince of Wales,

675
00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:15.030
for Edward, my son, thatwas Prince of Wales,

676
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:20.230
die in his youth by likeuntimely violence.

677
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:25.770
Thyself a queen, for methat was a queen,

678
00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.700
outlive thy glory, like mywretched self.

679
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:33.700
Long mayest thou live towail thy children's death,

680
00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.130
and see another, as I seethee now,

681
00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:40.430
decked in thy rights asthou art stalled in mine.

682
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:45.230
Long die thy happy daysbefore thy death,

683
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:50.000
and after many lengthenedhours of grief,

684
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.430
die neither mother, wife,nor England's queen.

685
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:58.270
Rivers and Dorset, youwere standers by.

686
00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:02.470
And so wast thou, LordHastings,

687
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:06.770
when my son was stabbedwith bloody daggers.

688
00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.300
God, I pray him

689
00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.100
that none of you may livehis natural age

690
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.800
but by some unlookedaccident cut off!

691
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.130
Have done thy charm, thouhateful, withered hag!

692
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:18.330
And leave out thee?

693
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:22.100
Stay, dog! For thou shalthear me.

694
00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:28.530
If heaven have anygrievous plague in store

695
00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:32.070
exceeding those that I canwish upon thee,

696
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:35.370
O, let them keep it tillthy sins be ripe,

697
00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:38.800
and then hurl down theirindignation on thee,

698
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.800
the troubler of the poorworld's peace.

699
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:48.100
The worm of consciencestill begnaw thy soul.

700
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:53.670
Thy friends suspect fortraitors whilst thou lives

701
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:57.930
and take deep traitors forthy dearest friends.

702
00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:01.630
No sleep close up thatdeadly eye of thine,

703
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:05.100
unless it be whilst sometormenting dream affrightsthee

704
00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.030
with a hell of uglydevils.

705
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:15.070
O, thou elfish-marked,abortive, rooting hog!

706
00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.500
Thou that wast sealed inthy nativity

707
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.830
the slave of nature andthe son of hell!

708
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:25.800
Ah, slander of thy heavymother's womb!

709
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.370
Thou loathed issue of thyfather's loins!

710
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:32.030
Thou rag of honor! Thoudetested--

711
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.030
Margaret!

712
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.030
Richard!

713
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.030
Huh?

714
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:36.130
I call thee not.

715
00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:37.500
I cry thee mercy, then,for I did think

716
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.370
that thou hadst called meall these bitter names.

717
00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.870
Why, so I did, but lookedfor no reply.

718
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:43.730
O, let me make the periodto my curse!

719
00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.200
'Tis done by me and endsin Margaret.

720
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.730
Thus have you breathed yourcurse against yourself.

721
00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:53.930
Poor painted queen, vainflourish of my fortune.

722
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:57.400
Why strew'st thou sugar onthat bottled spider,

723
00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.900
whose deadly web ensnareththee about?

724
00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.130
Fool, fool!

725
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:04.700
Thou whet'st a knife tokill thyself.

726
00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.130
The day will come thatthou shalt wish for me

727
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:11.230
to help thee curse thispoisonous bunchbacked toad.

728
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.700
False-boding woman, endthy frantic curse,

729
00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:15.900
lest to thy harm thou moveour patience.

730
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.130
Foul shame upon you!

731
00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.500
You have all moved mine!

732
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.400
Were you well served, youwould be taught your duty.

733
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.070
To serve me well, you allshould do me duty.

734
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:29.930
Teach me to be your queenand you my subjects.

735
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:33.670
O, to serve me well, teachyourselves that duty.

736
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.530
Peace, please, for shameif not for charity.

737
00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:39.570
Urge neither charity norshame to me!

738
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:42.770
Uncharitably with me haveyou dealt,

739
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:47.530
and shamefully my hopes byyou are butchered.

740
00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:53.600
My charity is outrage;life, my shame.

741
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.200
And in that shame stilllive my sorrow's rage!

742
00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.200
Have done, have done.

743
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.530
O princely Buckingham.

744
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:06.370
I kiss thy hand in sign ofleague and amity with thee.

745
00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:09.770
Now fair befall thee andthy noble house.

746
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:12.470
Thy garments are notspotted with our blood,

747
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:14.300
nor thou within thecompass of my curse.

748
00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:15.570
Nor no one here,

749
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:17.130
for curses never pass

750
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:19.300
the lips of those thatbreathe them in the air.

751
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:26.130
I will but think that theyascend the sky

752
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:31.370
and there awake God'sgentle-sleeping peace.

753
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:35.500
O Buckingham, take heed ofyonder dog!

754
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.730
Look, when he fawns, hebites.

755
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.900
And when he bites, hisvenom tooth will rankle tothe death.

756
00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.830
Have naught to do withhim. Beware of him.

757
00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:45.330
Sin, death, and hell haveset their marks on him,

758
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.830
and all their ministers,they attend on him.

759
00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.130
What doth she say, my lordof Buckingham?

760
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:56.070
Nothing that I respect, mygracious lord.

761
00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:59.670
What?

762
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:05.170
Dost thou scorn me for mygentle counsel

763
00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:08.400
and soothe the devil thatI warn thee from?

764
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:13.000
O, remember this anotherday,

765
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.670
when he shall split thyvery heart with sorrow,

766
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:21.570
and say poor Margaret wasa prophetess.

767
00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:28.670
Live, each of you,

768
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:32.670
the subjects to his hate

769
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:36.970
and he to yours

770
00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:40.100
and all of you to God's.

771
00:38:56.530 --> 00:39:00.800
My hair doth stand on endto hear her curses.

772
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.130
And so doth mine.

773
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:05.530
I muse why she's atliberty.

774
00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:09.870
I cannot blame her.

775
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:13.570
By God's holy mother, shehath had too much wrong,

776
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:17.330
and I repent my part thereofthat I have done to her.

777
00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:19.600
I never did her any, to myknowledge.

778
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.830
Yet you have all thevantage of her wrong.

779
00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:24.270
I was too hot to dosomebody good

780
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:26.430
that is too cold inthinking of it now.

781
00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:30.730
Marry, as for Clarence, heis well repaid.

782
00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:34.070
He is franked up tofatting for his pains.

783
00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:37.230
God pardon them that arethe cause thereof.

784
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:39.800
A virtuous and aChristian-like conclusion,

785
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.200
to pray for them that havedone scathe to us.

786
00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.630
So do I ever, beingwell-advised,

787
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.570
for had I cursed now, I'dcurse myself.

788
00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:49.170
Madam, his majesty dothcall for you

789
00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.800
and for your grace andyou, my gracious lords.

790
00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.970
Catesby, I come.

791
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:54.030
Lords, will you go withme?

792
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:55.270
We wait upon your grace.

793
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:05.500
I do the wrong and firstbegin to brawl.

794
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.530
The secret mischiefs thatI set abroach,

795
00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.570
I lay unto the grievouscharge of others.

796
00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.500
Clarence, whom I, indeed,have cast in darkness,

797
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.930
I do beweep to many simplegulls--

798
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:17.430
namely, to Derby,Hastings, Buckingham--

799
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:20.300
and tell them 'tis thequeen and her allies

800
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.100
that stir the king againstthe duke my brother.

801
00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.030
Now they believe it andwithal whet me

802
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:29.500
to be revenged on Rivers,Dorset, Grey.

803
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.300
But then I sigh and with apiece of scripture,

804
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:36.100
tell them that God bids usdo good for evil,

805
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.900
and thus I clothe my nakedvillainy

806
00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.400
with odd old ends stolenforth of holy writ

807
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.130
and seem a saint when mostI play the Devil.

808
00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.000
But soft. Here come myexecutioners.

809
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:55.870
How now, my hardy, stout,resolved mates.

810
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:57.870
Are you now going todispatch this thing?

811
00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:59.730
We are, my lord, and cometo have the warrant

812
00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.600
that we may be admittedwhere he is.

813
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.900
Well thought upon; I haveit here about me.

814
00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.670
When you have done, repairto Crosby Place.

815
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:15.900
But, sirs, be sudden in theexecution, withal obdurate.

816
00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.600
Do not hear him plead,

817
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.370
for Clarence iswell-spoken

818
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:21.070
and perhaps may move yourhearts to pity

819
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:22.070
if you mark him.

820
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:23.170
Tut, tut, my lord.

821
00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:24.870
We will not stand toprate.

822
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.870
Talkers are no good doers.

823
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:33.270
Be assured we go to use ourhands, not our tongues.

824
00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:39.230
Your eyes drop millstoneswhen fools' eyes fall tears.

825
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.270
I like you, lads.

826
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.570
About your business,straight.

827
00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:46.930
Go, go; dispatch.

828
00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:48.570
We will, my noble lord.

829
00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.170
Why looks your grace soheavily today?

830
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.800
O, I have passed amiserable night...

831
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:19.900
so full of fearful dreamsand ugly sights

832
00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.800
that, as I am a Christianfaithful man,

833
00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.630
I would not spend anothersuch a night

834
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.100
though 'twere to buy aworld of happy days,

835
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.270
so full of dismal terrorwas the time.

836
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:31.000
What was your dream, mylord?

837
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.200
I pray you, tell it.

838
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:37.900
Methought that I hadbroken from the Tower

839
00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.670
and was embark'd to crossto Burgundy.

840
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:43.900
And in my company, mybrother Gloucester,

841
00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.900
who from my cabin tempted meto walk upon the hatches.

842
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:51.570
Thence we looked towardEngland

843
00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:53.670
and cited up a thousandheavy times

844
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.230
during the wars of Yorkand Lancaster

845
00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:56.770
that had befallen us.

846
00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:02.200
As we paced along upon thegiddy footing of the hatches,

847
00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.230
methought that Gloucesterstumbled

848
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:06.830
and in falling, struck me,that thought to stay him,

849
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:09.730
overboard into the tumblingbillows of the main.

850
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:15.230
"O Lord," methought, "whatpain it was to drown."

851
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:18.430
What dreadful noise ofwaters in my ears.

852
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:22.030
What sights of ugly deathwithin my eyes.

853
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:26.430
Methought I saw a thousandfearful wrecks,

854
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:30.100
ten thousand men thatfishes gnawed upon,

855
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:33.930
wedges of gold, greatanchors, heaps of pearl,

856
00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:36.500
inestimable stones,unvalued jewels,

857
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.900
all scattered in thebottom of the sea.

858
00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.700
Some lay in dead men'sskulls.

859
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.370
And in the holes whereeyes did once inhabit,

860
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:49.700
there were crept, as'twere, in scorn of eyes,

861
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:54.600
reflecting gems that wooedthe slimy bottom of the deep

862
00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.970
and mocked the dead bonesthat lay scattered by.

863
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.700
Had you such leisure inthe time of death

864
00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.730
to gaze upon these secretsof the deep?

865
00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:04.930
Methought I had,

866
00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:07.930
and often did I strive toyield the ghost,

867
00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:11.030
but still the enviousflood stopped in my soul

868
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:12.200
and would not let it forth

869
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.470
to find the empty, vast,and wandering air

870
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:16.730
but smothered it within mypanting bulk,

871
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:18.370
which almost burst tobelch it in the sea.

872
00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:20.230
Awaked you not in thissore agony?

873
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:22.770
No, no, my dream waslengthened after life.

874
00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:28.870
O, then began the tempestto my soul.

875
00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:36.030
I passed, methought, themelancholy flood

876
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:38.770
with that sour ferrymanwhich poets write of

877
00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:42.230
unto the kingdom ofperpetual night.

878
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:47.430
The first that there didgreet my stranger soul

879
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:50.000
was my great father-in-law,renowned Warwick,

880
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.100
who spake aloud, "Whatscourge for perjury

881
00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:00.200
can this dark monarchyafford false Clarence?"

882
00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.700
And so he vanished.

883
00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:08.370
Then came wandering by ashadow like an angel

884
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.170
with bright hair dabbledin blood,

885
00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:14.200
and he shrieked out aloud,

886
00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.730
"Clarence is come,

887
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:20.070
"false, fleeting, perjuredClarence,

888
00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:22.630
"that stabbed me in thefield by Tewksbury.

889
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:27.300
Seize on him, Furies. Takehim unto torment!"

890
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.430
With that, methought,

891
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:30.600
a legion of foul fiendsenvironed me

892
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.870
and howled in mine earssuch hideous cries

893
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:35.030
that with the very noise,I trembling waked,

894
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:38.500
and for a season aftercould not believe but thatI was in hell,

895
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.700
such terrible impressionmade my dream.

896
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.030
No marvel, lord, though itaffrighted you.

897
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:46.530
I am afraid, methinks, tohear you tell it.

898
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:48.900
Keeper, keeper, I havedone these things

899
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.500
that now give evidenceagainst my soul, forEdward's sake.

900
00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.900
And see how he requitesme!

901
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:58.630
O God!

902
00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:00.370
If my deep prayers cannotappease thee,

903
00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:03.230
but thou wilt be avengedon my misdeeds,

904
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:05.770
yet execute thy wrath inme alone.

905
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:11.170
O, spare my guiltless wifeand my poor children.

906
00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:27.470
Keeper, I prithee, sit byme awhile.

907
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:31.030
My soul is heavy, and Ifain would sleep.

908
00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.570
I will, my lord.

909
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.670
God give your grace goodrest.

910
00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:31.200
Sorrow breaks seasons andreposing hours,

911
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.830
makes the night morningand the noontide night.

912
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.530
Princes have but theirtitles for their glories,

913
00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:46.300
an outward honor for aninward toil.

914
00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.870
And for unfeltimaginations,

915
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:52.230
they often feel a world ofrestless cares,

916
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:59.200
so that between theirtitles and low name,

917
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.870
there's nothing differsbut the outward fame.

918
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:03.100
How?

919
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.270
Who's here?

920
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:06.730
What wouldst thou, fellow?

921
00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:07.970
How cam'st thou hither?

922
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:09.470
I would speak withClarence,

923
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:11.700
and I came hither on melegs.

924
00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.300
What?

925
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.200
So brief?

926
00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.100
'Tis better, sir, than tobe tedious.

927
00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.830
Let him see our commission,and talk no more.

928
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.830
I am in this commanded todeliver

929
00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:48.600
the noble duke of Clarenceto your hands.

930
00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.470
I will not reason what ismeant hereby

931
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.370
because I will be guiltlessfrom the meaning.

932
00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:02.470
There lies the dukeasleep.

933
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:05.700
There are the keys.

934
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:13.700
I'll to the king andsignify to him

935
00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:16.400
that thus I have resignedto you my charge.

936
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.000
You may, sir.

937
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.630
'Tis a point of wisdom.

938
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:28.370
Fare you well?

939
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:35.130
What? Shall I stab him ashe sleeps?

940
00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:37.470
No.

941
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:40.070
For he'll say 'twas donecowardly when he wakes.

942
00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:43.370
Why, he shall never wakeuntil the great judgment day.

943
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:46.270
Why, then he'll say westabbed him sleeping.

944
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:50.370
The urging of that word"judgment"

945
00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:52.500
hath bred a kind ofremorse in me.

946
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.400
What? Art thou afraid?

947
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.300
Not to kill him, having awarrant,

948
00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.930
but to be damned forkilling him,

949
00:50:57.930 --> 00:50:59.830
from the which no warrantcan defend me.

950
00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:01.500
I thought thou hadst beenresolute.

951
00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.530
So I am, to let him live.

952
00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:10.300
I'll back to the duke ofGloucester and tell him so.

953
00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:14.170
Hey, I pray thee, stay alittle.

954
00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:17.630
I hope this passionatehumor of mine will change.

955
00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:22.170
It was wont to hold me butwhile one tells twenty.

956
00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:26.230
One, two, three, four,five, six, seven, eight,nine, ten,

957
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:28.830
eleven, twelve, thirteen,fourteen, fifteen,

958
00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:31.370
sixteen, seventeen,eighteen,

959
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:34.770
nineteen, twenty.

960
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:39.570
How dost thou feel thyselfnow?

961
00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:42.700
Some certain dregs ofconscience are yet within me.

962
00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.970
Remember our reward whenthe deed's done.

963
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:48.700
Zounds, he dies!

964
00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.500
I had forgot the reward.

965
00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.370
Where is thy consciencenow?

966
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:54.530
O, in the duke ofGloucester's purse.

967
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:57.070
When he opens his purse togive us our reward,

968
00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:58.230
thy conscience flies out.

969
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:59.730
'Tis no matter. Let it go.

970
00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:03.070
There's few or none willentertain it.

971
00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:05.730
Or if it come to theeagain?

972
00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:06.970
I'll not meddle with it.

973
00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:09.430
It makes a man a coward.

974
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:12.770
A man cannot steal but itaccuseth him.

975
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:15.500
A man cannot swear but itchecks him.

976
00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.030
A man cannot lie with hisneighbor's wife

977
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:19.730
but it detects him.

978
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:22.770
'Tis a blushing,shamefaced spirit

979
00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:24.570
that mutinies in a man'sbosom.

980
00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:27.470
It fills a man full ofobstacles.

981
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:30.530
It made me once restore apurse of gold

982
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:33.100
that by chance I found.

983
00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:34.970
It beggars any man thatkeeps it.

984
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:36.630
It is turned out of townsand cities

985
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:37.930
for a dangerous thing,

986
00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:40.230
and every man that meansto live well

987
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:43.270
endeavors to trust tohimself and live without it.

988
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:45.270
'Zounds.

989
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:48.000
'Tis is even now at myelbow,

990
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.100
persuading me not to killthe duke.

991
00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:54.070
Take the devil in thymind, and believe him not.

992
00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:56.730
He would insinuate withthee but to make thee sigh.

993
00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:59.100
Tut, I am strong-framed.

994
00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.430
He cannot prevail with me.

995
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:03.870
Spoke like a tall man thatrespects our reputation.

996
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:06.530
Come, shall we fall towork?

997
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:12.770
Take him on the costardwith the hilts of thy sword

998
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:16.300
and then throw him in themalmsey-butt in the next room.

999
00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:18.300
O excellent devise!

1000
00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:19.970
And make a sop of him.

1001
00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:25.930
Hark.

1002
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:28.900
He wakes.

1003
00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:30.270
Strike now?

1004
00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:34.000
We'll reason with him.

1005
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Where art thou, keeper?

1006
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.300
Give me a cup of wine.

1007
00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:41.170
You shall have wineenough, my lord, anon.

1008
00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:42.600
In God's name, what artthou?

1009
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.270
A man, as you are.

1010
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:47.970
But not, as I am, royal.

1011
00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:50.630
Nor you, as we are, loyal.

1012
00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:57.570
Thy voice is thunder, butthy looks are humble.

1013
00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:03.070
My voice is now theking's, my looks mine own.

1014
00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:06.330
How darkly and how deadlydost thou speak.

1015
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:12.000
Your eyes do menace me.

1016
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.470
Why look you pale?

1017
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:16.300
Who sent you hither?

1018
00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.330
Wherefore do you come?

1019
00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:18.330
To--

1020
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:22.970
To--

1021
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:26.200
To murder me?

1022
00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.370
Aye. Aye.

1023
00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:30.200
You scarcely have thehearts to tell me so

1024
00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.130
and therefore cannot havethe hearts to do it.

1025
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:35.870
Wherein, my friends, haveI offended you?

1026
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:39.330
Offended us you have notbut the king.

1027
00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:41.200
I shall be reconciled tohim again.

1028
00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:44.370
Never, my lord. Therefore,prepare to die.

1029
00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:46.800
Are you drawn forth amonga world of men

1030
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.270
to slay the innocent?

1031
00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:52.300
What is my offense?

1032
00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.870
Where is the evidence thatdoth accuse me?

1033
00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:58.400
What lawful quest havegiven their verdict up

1034
00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.830
unto the frowning judge?

1035
00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:01.600
Or who pronounced thebitter sentence

1036
00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.830
of poor Clarence death?

1037
00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:07.900
Before I be convict bycourse of law,

1038
00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:11.600
to threaten me with deathis most unlawful.

1039
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.530
I charge you, as you hopeto have redemption

1040
00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:17.270
by Christ's dear blood shedfor our grievous sins,

1041
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:19.900
that you depart and lay nohands on me.

1042
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.970
The deed you undertake isdamnable.

1043
00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:24.600
What we will do, we doupon command.

1044
00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.030
And he that hath commandedis our king.

1045
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:28.700
Erroneous vassals!

1046
00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.330
The great King of kings hathin the table of his law

1047
00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:33.570
commanded that thou shaltdo no murder.

1048
00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:37.730
Will you then spurn at hisedict and fulfill a man's?

1049
00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:41.030
Take heed, for he holdsvengeance in his hand

1050
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:43.330
to hurl upon their headsthat break his law.

1051
00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:46.030
And that same vengeancedoth he hurl on thee

1052
00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:48.300
for false forswearing andfor murder too.

1053
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.700
Thou didst receive thesacrament

1054
00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.730
to fight in quarrel of thehouse of Lancaster.

1055
00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:53.600
And like a traitor to thename of God

1056
00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.700
didst break that vow

1057
00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:56.330
and with thy treacherousblade

1058
00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:58.370
unrip'dst the bowels ofthy sovereign's son.

1059
00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:00.770
Whom thou was sworn tocherish and defend.

1060
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:03.100
How can thou urge God'sdreadful law to us,

1061
00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.830
when thou hast broke it insuch dear degree?

1062
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:07.030
Alas, for whose sake did Ithat ill deed?

1063
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.730
For Edward, for mybrother, for his sake.

1064
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:10.670
He sends you not to murderme for this,

1065
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:12.830
for in that sin, he is asdeep as I.

1066
00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:15.070
If God will be avenged forthe deed,

1067
00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:17.400
O, know you yet, he doesit publicly.

1068
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.930
Take not the quarrel fromhis powerful arm.

1069
00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:22.500
He needs no indirect orlawless course

1070
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.770
to cut off those that haveoffended him.

1071
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:26.270
Who made thee, then, abloody minister

1072
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:29.100
when gallant-springingbrave Plantagenet,

1073
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:31.570
that princely novice, wasstruck dead by thee?

1074
00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:33.330
My brother's love, thedevil, and my rage.

1075
00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:35.930
Thy brother's love, ourduty, and thy fault

1076
00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:38.430
provoke us hither now toslaughter thee.

1077
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:40.700
Oh, if you love mybrother, hate not me.

1078
00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:43.400
I am his brother, and Ilove him well.

1079
00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.730
If you are hired for meed,go back again,

1080
00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:47.070
and I will send you to mybrother Gloucester,

1081
00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:48.730
who shall reward youbetter for my life

1082
00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:50.070
than Edward will fortidings of my death.

1083
00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:51.300
You are deceived.

1084
00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:52.870
Your brother Gloucesterhates you.

1085
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:55.330
O, no, he loves me, and heholds me dear.

1086
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:56.370
Go you to him from me.

1087
00:56:56.370 --> 00:56:57.370
Aye, so we will.

1088
00:56:57.370 --> 00:56:59.430
Tell him when that ourprincely father York

1089
00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:01.300
blessed his three sonswith his victorious arm

1090
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.900
and charged us from hissoul to love each other,

1091
00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:05.930
he little thought of thisdivided friendship.

1092
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:08.500
Bid Gloucester think ofthis, and he will weep.

1093
00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.700
Ah, millstones, as helessoned us to weep.

1094
00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.470
O, do not slander him, forhe is kind!

1095
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:16.800
Right, as snow in harvest.

1096
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.970
Come, you deceiveyourself.

1097
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:22.500
'Tis he that sends us todestroy you here.

1098
00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.070
It cannot be,

1099
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:25.570
for he bewept my fortune

1100
00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:27.470
and hugged me in his armsand swore with sobs

1101
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:28.830
that he would labor mydelivery.

1102
00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:30.230
Why, so he doth,

1103
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:31.970
when he delivers you fromthis earth's thralldom

1104
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:33.470
to the joys of Heaven.

1105
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:35.830
Make peace with God, foryou must die, my lord.

1106
00:57:38.370 --> 00:57:39.770
Have you that holy feelingin your souls

1107
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:42.070
to counsel me to make mypeace with God,

1108
00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:45.800
and are you yet to yourown soul so blind

1109
00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:48.330
that you will war with Godby murdering me?

1110
00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:51.970
Oh, sirs, consider.

1111
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:54.470
They that set you on to dothis deed

1112
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:56.330
will hate you for thedeed.

1113
00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:00.230
What shall we do?

1114
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.830
Relent, and save yoursouls.

1115
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.200
Relent.

1116
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.700
No, 'tis cowardly andwomanish.

1117
00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:10.800
Not to relent is beastly,savage, devilish.

1118
00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.700
Which of you, if you werea prince's son

1119
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:14.470
being pent from liberty asI am now,

1120
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:15.930
if two such murderers asyourselves came to you

1121
00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:17.270
would not entreat forlife?

1122
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:20.170
Ah, you would beg, wereyou in my distress.

1123
00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:22.900
My friend, I spy some pityin thy looks.

1124
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.100
O, if thine eye be not aflatterer,

1125
00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.900
come thou on my side andentreat for me.

1126
00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:27.900
A begging prince, whatbeggar pities not?

1127
00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:29.170
Look behind you, my lord!

1128
00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:31.800
Take that.

1129
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.530
And that.

1130
00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:39.070
And if all this will notdo,

1131
00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:41.470
I'll drown you in themalmsey-butt within.

1132
00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:59.200
A bloody deed, anddesperately dispatched.

1133
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.570
How fain, like Pilate,would I wash my hands

1134
00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:03.600
of this most grievousmurder.

1135
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:06.130
How now.

1136
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:08.070
What mean'st thou, thatthou helped me not?

1137
00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:11.330
The duke shall know howslack you have been.

1138
00:59:11.330 --> 00:59:13.330
I would he knew that I hadsaved his brother.

1139
00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:15.170
Take thou the fee, andtell him what I say,

1140
00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:17.670
for I repent me that theduke is slain!

1141
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:19.600
Go, coward, as thou art!

1142
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:23.830
Well.

1143
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.930
I'll go hide the body insome hole

1144
00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:31.300
till that the duke giveorder for his burial.

1145
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:34.970
And when I have my meed, Iwill away,

1146
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:39.730
for this will out, andthen I must not stay.

1147
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
