WEBVTT

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
[FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
100 MILLION YEARS AGO
IN THE CRETACEOUS PERIOD,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
THE OPEN UNIVERSITY HERE
IN MILTON KEYNES, AND I,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
WOULD HAVE BEEN
SUBMERGED BENEATH THE SEA.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
AND IF I WANT TO SEE
THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I HAVE ONLY TO TRAVEL
A FEW MILES SOUTH FROM HERE

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
ALONG THE OLD ROMAN ROAD
TO LONDON--

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
WATLING STREET,
OR THE A5 AS WE CALL IT NOW.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
THIS QUARRY HERE
GIVES US A GOOD SECTION

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
THROUGH THE LOWER PART OF THE
CRETACEOUS SEQUENCE HEREABOUTS.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE QUARRY

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
IS THE LOWER GREENSAND
 OF LATE APTIAN AGE,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
AND ABOVE THAT
 IS THE ALBIAN GAULT CLAY.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
THE LOWER GREENSAND
CONSISTS OF A VARIETY

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
OF MARGINAL AND INSHORE
SHALLOW MARINE SANDY FACIES

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
WITH QUITE A LOT OF EVIDENCE
FOR TIDAL CURRENT ACTIVITIES

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
SUCH AS MUD DRAPES,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
AND HERRINGBONE
 CROSS-STRATIFICATION.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
THE GAULT CLAY,
BY CONTRAST, CONSISTS ONLY OF

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
FINE-GRAIN TERRIGENOUS DEPOSITS
CARRIED MUCH FURTHER OFFSHORE

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
AND ALLOWED TO SETTLE
OUT IN DEEPER WATER.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
THE GAULT IS EASILY ERODED AND
SO GIVES RISE TO THE LOW GROUND

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
THAT WE CAN SEE OFF
TO THE SOUTH AND WEST FROM HERE

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
IN THE EASTWARD EXTENSION
OF THE VALE OF AYLESBURY.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
IF WE WANT TO SEE THE
NEXT UNIT UP IN THE SEQUENCE,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRAVEL
FURTHER SOUTH AGAIN.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I'M JUST A COUPLE OF MILES
 NORTH OF DUNSTABLE HERE,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
AND WE CAN SEE THE LOW VALE
 UNDERLAIN BY THE GAULT CLAY

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
ABUTTING AGAINST THE CHILTERN
 ESCARPMENT ON THE HORIZON,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
WHICH IS FORMED
 BY THE LOWER PART OF THE CHALK,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
OR THE GRAY CHALK
 AS IT'S TECHNICALLY CALLED,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
WHICH IS OF CENOMANIAN AGE.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
WE CAN SEE
SOME OF THAT CHALK CROPPING OUT

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
IN ABANDONED CEMENT QUARRIES

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
DOTTED ALONG THE TOP
OF THE ESCARPMENT.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
LET.S GO AND TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
HERE WE ARE THEN IN ONE
 OF THESE ABANDONED QUARRIES,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
SOMEWHAT OVERGROWN,
 BUT WE CAN STILL SEE

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
THE WHITE FACIES FORMED BY
 THE MASSIVE DEPOSITS OF CHALK.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
AND A CURIOUS DEPOSIT
 IT IS TOO.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
DEVOID OF THE
 SILISICLASTIC SEDIMENTS,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
THE SANDS AND MUDS THAT WE SAW
LOWER DOWN IN THE SUCCESSION,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
IT'S A FINE, WHITE, POWDERY
LIMESTONE, WHICH CONTAINS

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
SCATTERED MACRO-FOSSILS,
INCLUDING PARTICULARLY

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
THE REMAINS OF SUCH
FREE-SWIMMING FORMS

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
AS THIS AMMONITE HERE.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
SO WE'VE PASSED FROM

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
INSHORE SHALLOW MARINE
SILISICLASTIC DEPOSITS

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
UP TO FINE WHITE CHALKS,
WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
IN WATER DEEP ENOUGH
FOR SUCH ANIMALS AS AMMONITES

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
TO SWIM AROUND IN,
AND SUFFICIENTLY FAR OFFSHORE

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
FOR THERE TO HAVE BEEN
VERY LITTLE SILISICLASTIC INPUT

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
FROM THE LAND.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S A STRONGLY
TRANSGRESSIVE SUCCESSION,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
AND THAT MEANS THAT
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
A SIGNIFICANT RISE
IN RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
IT'S WHAT'S
SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
"THE GREAT CRETACEOUS
TRANSGRESSION..

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
NARRATOR: THE FINE-GRAINED
 MATRIX OF THE CHALK

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
IS MAINLY COMPOSED
 OF THE SKELETAL REMAINS

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
OF MICROSCOPIC
 PLANKTONIC ORGANISMS,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
ESPECIALLY COCCOLITHOPHORES.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
SEDIMENT CORE SAMPLES HARVESTED
 BY OCEAN-DRILLING SHIPS

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
SHOW THAT TODAY
 THESE SINGLE-CELLED ALGAE

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
TYPICALLY OCCUPY
 OCEANIC WATERS,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
AND THAT THEIR
 ACCUMULATED REMAINS

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
ARE ABUNDANT IN THE SHALLOWER
 PARTS OF THE OCEAN FLOOR.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
SO, IN THE CRETACEOUS,
 THE RISE IN SEA LEVEL

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
SEEMS TO HAVE ALLOWED
 OCEANIC WATER MASSES

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
TO FLOOD
 ONTO THE CONTINENTS.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
THE RISE IN SEA LEVEL
 WAS TRULY GLOBAL IN EXTENT,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
WITH SHELF SEAS
 SPREADING ACROSS

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
LARGE AREAS
 OF THE CONTINENTS.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
IN CENOMANIAN TIMES,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
WHILE THE GREY CHALK
 WAS ACCUMULATING IN ENGLAND,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
VAST CARBONATE PLATFORMS
 DEVELOPED IN THE SHALLOW SEAS

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
THAT FORMED
 AT LOWER LATITUDES

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
IN AND AROUND THE CONJOINED
 TETHYS AND ATLANTIC OCEANS.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
THOSE OF THE WESTERN TETHYS

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
WERE PARTICULARLY
 WELL DEVELOPED AT THAT TIME,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
AND THIS PROGRAM
 WILL LOOK IN DETAIL

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
AT THE DEVELOPMENT
 OF ONE OF THESE PLATFORMS,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
THE ADRIATIC
 CARBONATE PLATFORM.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
THIS WAS ONE OF
 THE LARGE ISOLATED PLATFORMS

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
THAT THEN LAY
 IN THE CENTRAL PART

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
OF THE WESTERN TETHYAN OCEAN.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
TODAY, FOLLOWING THE CLOSURE
 OF THE TETHYS OCEAN,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
THE LIMESTONES OF
 THE ADRIATIC CARBONATE PLATFORM

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
ARE INCORPORATED
 IN THE DINARIC MOUNTAIN CHAIN,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
THE NORTHERN PART OF WHICH
 RUNS ALONG THE ADRIATIC COAST

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
OF WESTERN CROATIA.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
THE CRETACEOUS
 PLATFORM DEPOSITS

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
ARE PARTICULARLY
 WELL EXPOSED,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
WITH RELATIVELY
 LITTLE DEFORMATION,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
IN THE PENINSULA OF ISTRIA,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
SITUATED AT THE NORTHERN END
 OF THE ADRIATIC SEA.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
SKELTON: WELCOME TO PULA
 IN THE SOUTHERN PART

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
OF THE ISTRIAN PENINSULA
 OF CROATIA,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
AND ITS SPECTACULARLY
 WELL-PRESERVED ROMAN ARENA.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
WHEN THEY BUILT IT IN THE FIRST
 TO THE SECOND CENTURY A.D.,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
THE ROMANS HAD
NO PROBLEM AT ALL

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
TO FIND SUITABLE BUILDING STONE
IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRYSIDE,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
FOR MOST OF ISTRIA
IS UNDERLAIN

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
BY CLEAN, WHITE
CRETACEOUS LIMESTONES

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
WHICH CAN BE CUT
INTO BLOCKS OF ANY DESIRED SIZE.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I'M HERE TO MEET IGOR VLAHOVICH,
FROM THE INSTITUTE OF GEOLOGY,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
THAT'S THE
NATIONAL GEOLOGICAL SURVEY,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A CLOSER
LOOK AT SOME OF THIS LIMESTONE

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
AND HOW IT WAS FORMED.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
HI, IGOR.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
HI, PETER.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
WHAT.S IT LIKE THEN?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
IT'S A BIOCLASTIC MEDIUM
TO COARSE-GRAINED PACK STONE

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
TO GRAIN STONE AND IT IS
COMPOSED OF FINE GRAINED DEBRIS,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
BUT ALSO OF ENTIRE SHELLS

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
AND PARTS OF RUDIST
AND MOLLUSK SHELLS.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
IT'S ABSOLUTELY
BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T IT?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
THIS IS A LOVELY EXAMPLE HERE
OF A... OF A TYPICAL RUDIST

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
WITH THE OUTER SHELL THERE
OF CALCITE, NICELY PRESERVED,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
RATHER DARK-BROWN COLOR HERE,
AND INSIDE THAT,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
THE RATHER THICKER
NOW WHITE SHELL THERE

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
WHICH WAS
ORIGINALLY ARAGONITE,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
BUT OF COURSE BEEN
DISSOLVED AWAY NOW

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
AND THE CAVITY
HAS BEEN PARTIALLY FILLED

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
WITH SPARRY CALCITE.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
WHAT.S... WHAT.S THE AGE
OF THIS MATERIAL?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
CONCERNING MICRO-
PALEONTOLOGICAL EVIDENCE,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
MOSTLY BENTHIC FORAMINIFER
AND OF COURSE RUDISTS,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
WE KNOW THAT
IT IS OF CENOMANIAN AGE.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
PRECISELY, IT IS OF THE UPPER
PART OF THE LOWER CENOMANIAN

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
TO LOWER PART
OF THE MIDDLE CENOMANIAN.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
OK, SO THAT.S ABOUT EQUIVALENT
TO THE LOWER CHALK IN ENGLAND.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
YES, IT.S ABOUT
95 MILLION YEARS OLD.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
THE RUDISTS, WITH THEIR
ASSOCIATED BIOTA

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
WERE THEREFORE RESPONSIBLE
FOR GENERATING THE VAST AMOUNTS

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
OF SHELL DEBRIS AND SAND
WHICH EVENTUALLY MADE UP

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
THESE LIMESTONES,
AND THIS ROCK TYPE

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
IS A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT
OF THE VAST CARBONATE PLATFORMS

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
THAT WERE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH
THE TETHYAN-ATLANTIC SEAWAY

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
OF THE CRETACEOUS WORLD.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
YOU SAID THAT THEY WERE
OF CENOMANIAN AGE,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
SO HOW DOES THAT FIT

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
INTO THE GENERAL PATTERN
OF ISTRIAN GEOLOGY?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
VLAHOVICH: THE SUCCESSION
 OF ISTRIAN DEPOSITS

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
RUNS FROM MIDDLE JURASSIC
 TO MIDDLE EOCENE

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
AND WE DIVIDED IT INTO
 FOUR LARGE-SCALE SEQUENCES

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
SO CENOMANIAN ROCKS
 REPRESENT

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
PART OF THE THIRD
 LARGE-SCALE SEQUENCE

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
OF ISTRIAN SUCCESSION.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
SKELTON: AND THAT THIRD
 LARGE-SCALE SEQUENCE

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
RUNS FROM WHEN TILL WHEN?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
VLAHOVICH: IT RUNS FROM
 THE END OF THE LOWER ALBIAN

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
OR BEGINNING
 OF THE MIDDLE ALBIAN

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
UP TO THE UPPER CENTONIAN.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
SO IF WE WANT TO GO
AND LOOK AT THE OLDEST ROCKS

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
OF THAT THIRD
LARGE-SCALE SEQUENCE,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
WHERE DO
WE NEED TO GO NOW?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
A MAJOR GEOLOGICAL
STRUCTURE OF ISTRIA

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
IS THE WESTERN
 ISTRIAN ANTICLINE.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
SO, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE
 THE LOWER BOUNDARY

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
OF THIS SUCCESSION,
 WE SHOULD APPROACH ITS CORE,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
SO WE SHOULD GO
 TOWARDS THE NORTH

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
AND TO THE VILLAGE
 OF KANFANAR.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
NARRATOR: HERE,
 IN A QUARRY NEAR KANFANAR,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
LIMESTONE FROM THE TOP
 OF THE PRECEDING

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
SECOND LARGE-SCALE SEQUENCE
 IS CUT INTO BLOCKS,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
WHICH ARE THEN SLICED
 AND POLISHED AS FACING STONE.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
THE LIMESTONE WAS DEPOSITED
 IN EARLY APTIAN TIMES,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
IN THE RESTRICTED SHALLOW
 WATERS OF A PLATFORM INTERIOR,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
WITH SCATTERED CLUMPS
 OF RUDIST SHELLS.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
AT THE TOP OF THIS LIMESTONE IS
 A THIN LAYER OF GREENISH CLAY,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
MARKING THE BASE OF THE THIRD
 LARGE-SCALE SEQUENCE,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
FOLLOWED HERE BY A THIN CAP
 OF ALBIAN LIMESTONES.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
IN A SMALL,
 DISUSED QUARRY NEARBY,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
IGOR AND PETER
 ARE ABLE TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
AT THIS MAJOR
 SEQUENCE BOUNDARY.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
HERE AT THE TOP
OF THE APTIAN LIMESTONES

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
WE SEE QUITE
AN IRREGULAR SURFACE

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
WITH IMPORTANT BUTTRESSES
STICKING UP THERE

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
WHICH IS TYPICAL FOR SUB-AERIAL
CASTING, WEATHERING,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
SO I SUPPOSE THAT
THE CLAYS MUST REPRESENT

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
SOME KIND OF A FOSSIL SOIL.
SO THE WHOLE PACKAGE THERE

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
REPRESENTS A PERIOD
 OF IMMERSION,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
AND THE UPPER ALBIAN
LIMESTONES HERE REPRESENT

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
THE RETURN
OF MARINE DEPOSITS.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
SO WE'RE GOING FROM ABOUT
THE MIDDLE OF THE APTIAN

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
UP TO THE UPPER ALBIAN,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
THAT'S AT LEAST
15 MILLION YEARS.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
AND YET DURING
THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
IN BRITAIN FOR EXAMPLE,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
THERE'S AN IMPORTANT
TRANSGRESSION,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
GOING FROM THE LOWER GREENSAND
UP TO THE GAULT.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THEREFORE
THE IMMERSION THAT WE SEE HERE?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
WE HAVE DONE A LOT
OF REGIONAL WORK,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
AND WE HAVE STUDIED
SEVERAL SECTIONS IN DETAIL

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
THROUGHOUT THE ADRIATIC
CARBONATE PLATFORM,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
WHICH IS
MORE THAN 600 KM LONG.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
IN ALL AREAS WE HAVE FOUND
IMMERSION LIKE THIS.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
HOWEVER, THE LARGEST
STRATIGRAPHIC GAP

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
IS HERE IN ISTRIA.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
ON SEVERAL LOCALITIES
ALONG THE ISTRIAN ANTICLINE,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
WE HAVE MADE DETAILED COLUMNS,
AND WE HAVE FOUND OUT

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
THAT THERE IS FROM
11 TO 19 MILLION YEARS MISSING.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
EXACTLY AT THIS LOCALITY

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
THERE IS ABOUT
16 MILLION YEARS MISSING.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
IN OTHER PARTS
OF THE PLATFORM,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
THIS STRATIGRAPHIC GAP
IS MUCH SHORTER,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
SO IN SOME PLACES
IT IS ABOUT FIVE MILLION YEARS

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
IN SOME PLACES ABOUT
THREE OR ONLY TWO MILLION YEARS.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
WHAT IS VERY IMPORTANT,
IN THOSE PARTS WE HAVE

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
UPPER APTIAN DEPOSITS
AND LOWER ALBIAN DEPOSITS.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
SO NOT LIKE HERE,
HERE WE'VE GOT ONLY

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
LOWER APTIAN
AND UPPER ALBIAN.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
HOWEVER, THIS EMERGENCE
IS EXACTLY AT THE BOUNDARY

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
BETWEEN APTIAN AND ALBIAN,
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
FROM THE REGIONAL SCALE,
YOU WILL SEE THAT FOR THAT

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SYN-SEDIMENTARY
TECTONIC CONTROL.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
SO THAT'S THE REASON WE HAVE
DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF SUBSIDENCE

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
AT THE SAME LEVEL
AND DIFFERENT CONTROL

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
OVER THE REGIONAL
SUCCESSION OF DEPOSITS.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
DIFFERENTIAL SUBSIDENCE
HAS TO IMPLY A TECTONIC CONTROL.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
YES, YES.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
NARRATOR: THE STRATIGRAPHICAL
 SUCCESSION CAN BE FOLLOWED

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
UPWARDS, AT STOJA COVE
 TO THE SOUTH OF PULA,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
WHERE MORE OF
 THE UPPER ALBIAN LIMESTONES

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
LIE EXPOSED
 ALONG THE SHORELINE.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
HERE AT STOJA COVE I'VE COME UP
ABOUT 300 METERS FROM THE BASE

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
OF THE LARGE-SCALE SEQUENCE,
ALWAYS WITHIN THE UPPER ALBIAN.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
THAT PART OF THE SUCCESSION
WAS ENTIRELY DEPOSITED

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
WITHIN RELATIVELY
SHALLOW WATER.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE
AT CERTAIN HORIZONS

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
YOU CAN FIND DINOSAUR
FOOTPRINTS AND MUD CRACKS.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
PROBABLY WITHIN
THAT PART OF THE SUCCESSION

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
IS A SMALL-SCALE SEQUENCE,
BUT EXPRESSED

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
ONLY AS RELATIVELY SUBTLE
VARIATIONS IN DEPTH.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
WE'VE COME NOW TO
THE UPPERMOST PART OF THE ALBIAN

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
AND WE STILL HAVE
THESE RELATIVELY THIN

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
BEDDED LIMESTONES WHICH WERE
DEPOSITED IN SHALLOW WATER,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
TYPICALLY ORGANIZED INTO PACKETS
OF SEDIMENTS SUCH AS THIS,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
FINE-GRAINED PELOIDAL
WACKY STONES AND PACK STONES

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
WHICH WOULD
HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
IN VERY SHALLOW RESTRICTED
SUBTIDAL CONDITIONS,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000
AND THEN PACKETS
OF BEAUTIFUL STROMATOLITES HERE

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
WITH THESE
LAMINAR FENESTREE IN.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
THESE WOULD HAVE BEEN
 DEPOSITED IN INTERTIDAL

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
OR EVEN
SUPERTIDAL CONDITIONS.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
TOGETHER, THEREFORE,
WE CAN RECOGNIZE

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
WHAT ARE KNOWN AS PERITIDAL
CYCLES FROM SUBTIDAL

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
TO INTER OR EVEN
SUPERTIDAL CONDITIONS

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
AND THESE ARE TYPICALLY
THE DEPOSITS THAT WE FIND

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
IN THE RESTRICTED INTERIOR OF
CRETACEOUS CARBONATE PLATFORMS.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
NARRATOR: SLIGHTLY
 HIGHER UP THE SUCCESSION,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
AT NEARBY CINTINERA COVE,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
THE STROMATOLITES
 BECOME SCARCER

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
AND OTHER
 SEDIMENTARY STRUCTURES

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
BEGIN TO MAKE
 THEIR APPEARANCE.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
I'VE COME UP ONLY ABOUT
20 METERS FROM THE LEVEL

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
WHERE WE WERE LOOKING
AT THE PERITIDAL DEPOSITS,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
AND ALREADY THERE'S
QUITE A BIG CHANGE

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
IN THE CHARACTER OF
THE SEDIMENTARY STRUCTURES.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
HERE.S A VERY NICE EXAMPLE OF
HUMMOCKY CROSS-STRATIFICATION.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
HERE IS THE HUMMOCK...

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
PASSING DOWN HERE
INTO THE SWALE

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
WITH A VERY
LOW-ANGLED TRUNCATION

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
OF THE LAMINATIONS BENEATH.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
HUMMOCKY
CROSS-STRATIFICATION

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
IS A CLEAR INDICATOR
OF DEPOSITION

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
BELOW FAIR-WEATHER WAVE BASE
IN THE OFFSHORE TRANSITION ZONE,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
SO ALREADY WE'RE SEEING
EVIDENCE HERE FOR A DEEPENING

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
OF THE DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
A LITTLE FURTHER UP HERE
THINGS REALLY BEGIN

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
TO GET QUITE INTERESTING.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
AT THIS LEVEL HERE, MORE
EVIDENCE OF STORM DEPOSITION.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
HERE ARE SOME RUDIST SHELLS
WHICH HAVE CLEARLY BEEN ROUNDED

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
AND THEY MUST HAVE BEEN
RE-WORKED AND TRANSPORTED

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
FROM SOME SHALLOWER
 WATER AREA AND WASHED

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
INTO THIS DEEPER SEDIMENTARY
 ENVIRONMENT BY STORM CURRENTS.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
JUST A LITTLE
FURTHER UP HERE

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
ARE SOME BURROWS
WHICH HAVE BEEN FILLED

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
BY LARGER BENTHIC FORAMINIFERA
KNOWN AS ORBITALINES.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
THESE ARE VERY INTERESTING

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
BECAUSE THIS PARTICULAR
SPECIES OF ORBITALINES

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
IS THE FIRST
INDICATION THAT WE HAVE

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
OF DEPOSITION
IN THE CENOMANIAN,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
SO ALREADY WE'VE NOW
COME UP INTO THE CENOMANIAN.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
NARRATOR: BESIDES
 THE SEDIMENTOLOGICAL EVIDENCE

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
FOR DEEPENING
 IN THIS PART OF THE SEQUENCE,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
SOME OTHER FEATURES HELP
 TO THROW LIGHT ON ITS CAUSE.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
OK, IGOR,
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND HERE?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
HERE WE.VE GOT ONE SMALL-SCALE
SYN-SEDIMENTARY DEFORMATION.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
HERE AS YOU CAN SEE WE'VE GOT
THIS FLAT SURFACE BELOW,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
THEN WE.VE GOT THIS STRUCTURE
WHICH IS CLIMBING--

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
A SMALL OVERTRUSS
WHICH IS CLIMBING

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
OVER THIS PART
OF THE SEQUENCE

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
AND HERE WE.VE GOT
SOME SMALL-SCALE SLUMPS.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
THE ORIENTATION IS INTERESTING,
IT IS TOWARDS SOUTH-EAST,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
GENERALLY TOWARDS SOUTH-EAST.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
AND ON TOP OF THIS STRUCTURE
WE CAN SEE FLAT LAYERS.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
THAT MEANS THIS IS INSIDE
ONE PACKAGE OF DEPOSITS.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
SO THE WHOLE STRUCTURE IS
ENCASED WITHIN ONE UNIT?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
YES.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
OK.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY MORE
OF THESE SORT OF STRUCTURES?

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
YES, BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME
SYN-SEDIMENTARY STRUCTURES.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
LET.S GO
AND HAVE A LOOK.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
HERE.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
VLAHOVICH: HERE WE'VE GOT
ANOTHER INTERESTING FEATURE

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
OF SYN-SEDIMENTARY ORIGIN.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
WE'VE GOT
SMALL SCALE GROWTH FAULT.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
WE CAN SEE IN THIS HANGING WALL
A STEEPER INCLINATION

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
OF THESE LAMINATIONS
AND WE CAN SEE THE THICKNESS

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
WHICH IS HIGHER IN THE HANGING
WALL THAN IN THE FOOTWALL.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
SO THAT PROVES THEREFORE
THAT THE FAULT MOVEMENT

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
MUST HAVE OCCURRED DURING
 SEDIMENTATION?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
VLAHOVICH: DEFINITELY.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
OK, IGOR, THEN HOW DOES THAT FIT
INTO THE REGIONAL PICTURE?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
THE ORIENTATION OF ALL THESE
STRUCTURES THAT YOU'VE SEEN

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
IS TOWARDS SOUTH-EAST,
SO THIS IS THE ORIENTATION

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
WHICH IS NORMAL TO THE AXIS
OF THE WEST ISTRIAN ANTICLINE.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
SO AT THIS MOMENT
 WE HAVE A RECORD

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
OF THE TILTING OF THE AREA
 TOWARDS SOUTH-EAST.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
SO THAT COULD EXPLAIN

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
THE SEDIMENTARY EVIDENCE
WE'VE SEEN FOR DEEPENING.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
YES, YES.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
WE HAVE... WE HAVE
GENTLE INCLINES, RAMP...

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
SKELTON: OK.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
...FROM FORMER FLAT PLATFORM.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
AND IS THE DEEPENING
ENTIRELY TECTONIC IN ORIGIN?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
DEEPENING IS
MOSTLY TECTONIC IN ORIGIN.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
THE PROBLEM IS THROUGHOUT THE
INVERTEBRATE CARBONATE PLATFORM

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
WE HAVE A WEAK
EUSTATIC SIGNAL AT THIS LEVEL,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
SO THERE IS A SMALL
EUSTATIC SEA LEVEL RISE.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
BUT IN THIS AREA
AS WELL AS IN THE AREA

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
OF THE NEIGHBORING ISLAND
OF TERES, WE HAVE...

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
THIS SIGNAL IS VERY,
VERY MUCH AUGMENTED

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
BY THE LOCAL
SYN-SEDIMENTARY TECTONICS.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
SKELTON: SO THAT'S
 CREATING IN EFFECT

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
A LARGE EXTENDED WEDGE SHAPE
 OF ACCOMMODATION SPACE.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
VLAHOVICH: YES, YES.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
SKELTON: OK.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
NARRATOR:
 THE BEST WAY TO SEE

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
HOW THIS NEW ACCOMMODATION
 SPACE BECAME FILLED IN

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
IS TO TAKE A BOAT TRIP
 TO THE COASTAL CLIFF

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
OF FRAAKERISLAND,
 A LITTLE TO THE SOUTH OF PULA.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
VLAHOVICH: WITH THE OUTCROP
LIKE THIS, WE CAN REALLY SEE

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
THE LARGE-SCALE ARCHITECTURE
OF THE SEDIMENTARY BODY.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
SO HERE AT THE BOTTOM
WE CAN SEE ALBIAN DEPOSITS

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
WHICH ARE
 THIN-BEDDED LIMESTONES.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
SKELTON:
 OK, THAT'S FORMING THAT...

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
THAT BENCH WE SEE
 ALONG THE BOTTOM THERE?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
VLAHOVICH: YES, YES, AND THEY
 ARE VERY GENTLE INCLINES.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
THIS IS ORIGINAL DIPPING
 OF THE... OF THIS LIMB

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
OF THE WEST
 ISTRIAN ANTICLINE.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
AND WHAT.S HAPPENING
ALONG HERE?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
VLAHOVICH: HERE WE CAN SEE
 STEEPLY INCLINED BEDS

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
OF PROGRADING
 CLINOFORMS.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
SKELTON: OK, THEY'RE
 AT A MUCH STEEPER ANGLE.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
VLAHOVICH:
 YES, THEY ARE MUCH STEEPER

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
THAN THE ORIGINAL DIPPING.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
OK, AND WHICH DIRECTION
IS THAT THAT'S...?

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
THEY'RE INCLINED
TOWARDS SOUTH-EAST,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
TOWARDS DEEPER PARTS
OF THE RAMP.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.000
ALWAYS THEN...

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
ALWAYS SOUTH-EAST.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
...TOWARDS THE AREA
OF MAXIMUM DEPRESSION.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:08.000
YES.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
NARRATOR: THE UPPER PARTS
 OF THESE CLINOFORMS

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
ARE EXPOSED ON
 THE TOP SURFACE OF THE ISLAND,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
WHERE CLUES CAN BE FOUND

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE
 OF ALL THIS MATERIAL.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
AND HERE IN THISMARVELOUS
PRESERVATIONAL WINDOW HERE

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
WE SEE, IF YOU LIKE, THE MAIN
CARBONATE FACTORY FLOOR.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
MASSES OF RUDISTS
PRESERVED IN LIFE POSITION

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
FORMING RELATIVELY THIN,
BUT LATERALLY EXTENSIVE

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
CARPETS AT THE TOPS
OF THE CLINOFORMS.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
THESE PARTICULAR KINDS OF
RUDISTS WE REFER TO IN GENERAL

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
AS "ELEVATOR RUDISTS"
BECAUSE THEIR CONICAL

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
OR CYLINDRICAL SHELLS
GREW SEMI-IMPLANTED

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
IN THE BIOCLASTIC SEDIMENT
THAT WAS PRODUCED

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
BY THE BREAKDOWN OF EARLIER
GENERATIONS OF SHELLS,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
AND THE RUDISTS GREW
 IN LITTLE BOUQUETS AND CLUSTERS

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
THAT SPREAD OVER THE SURFACE
LIKE SHELLY MEADOWS.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
HERE'S A LOVELY EXAMPLE OF ONE
OF THESE ELEVATOR RUDISTS,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
PRESERVED IN LIFE POSITION,
SEMI-INCLINED

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
WITH ITS CONICAL APEX OF THE
SHELL DOWN AT THE BOTTOM HERE,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
AND WITHIN THE SECTION
YOU CAN SEE THESE FALSE FLOORS,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
OR TABULAE AS THEY'RE CALLED,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
STILL MAINTAINING
THE HORIZONTAL

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
IN WHICH THEY WERE FORMED
 IN THE ORIGINAL ENVIRONMENT,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
SO THAT PROVES
THAT THIS EXAMPLE

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
IS PRESERVED PERFECTLY
IN LIFE POSITION.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
NARRATOR: A MODERN ANALOG
 FOR THESE ELEVATOR RUDISTS

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
IS THE PEN SHELL, PINNA,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
WHICH CAN BE FOUND
 SEMI-IMPLANTED

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
IN LOOSE SEDIMENT ALONG
 THE COAST OF ISTRIA TODAY,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.000
AT ONLY A FEW METERS DEPTH.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
HERE AND THERE ON TOP
OF THE BIOSTROMES

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
THERE ARE THIN SHEETS
OF BIOCLASTIC SEDIMENT,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
CARPETED BY THESE
ELONGATE RUDISTS HERE

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
OF A VERY DIFFERENT SHAPE
 FROM THE ELEVATOR ONES

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
THAT WE.VE JUST
 BEEN LOOKING AT.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
THESE ARE WHAT WE CALL
RECUMBENT RUDISTS.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
THEY WERE CLEARLY ADAPTED
TO LIVING VERY STABLY,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
BUT PRONE
UPON THE SEDIMENT SURFACE

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
IN AREAS WHERE THE SEDIMENT
WAS BEING SWEPT PAST THEM

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
BY CURRENTS,
AND NOT ACCUMULATING.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
IT SEEMS THAT THESE
 MUST HAVE LIVED ON THE TOPS

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
OF THE ADVANCING BANKS
 WITHIN WHICH

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
THE ELEVATOR RUDISTS
 HAD BEEN GROWING.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
NARRATOR: THE ISLAND ALSO
 HOLDS ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTEREST.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
SMALL TRIAL QUARRIES EXCAVATED
 BY THE ROMANS IN THEIR SEARCH

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
FOR SUITABLE BUILDING STONE.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
A FEW KILOMETERS
 INLAND FROM FRAAKER ISLAND,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
THE SAME CLINOFORMS
 CAN BE SEEN IN SECTION

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
IN AN ABANDONED QUARRY.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
AND ON THE FLOOR OF THE QUARRY,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
THE MATERIAL UNDERLYING
 THE CLINOFORMS IS EXPOSED.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
HERE AT THE
HORIZONTALLY-CUT FLOOR

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
AT THE BOTTOM
OF VINKURAN QUARRY,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
WE CAN SEE
BURROW SYSTEMS

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
EXACTLY THE SAME
LIKE IN CINTINERA COVE.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
AND THEY ARE FILLED
WITH SAME ORBITALINES.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
OK, AND INTERESTINGLY,
HERE ON THIS FLAT SURFACE

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
WE SEE VERY NICELY
THE Y-SHAPED BRANCHING PATTERN

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
THAT'S TYPICAL
OF THALASSINOIDES.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
AND DIRECTLY ABOVE
THIS LEVEL

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
THERE ARE CLINOFORMS

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
THAT WE SAW
AT THE FRAAKER ISLAND.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
SO HOW WOULD YOU NOW INTERPRET
THIS PART OF THE SEQUENCE

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
IN TERMS OF
SEQUENCE STRATIGRAPHY?

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
VLAHOVICH: THE PART BELOW US
 IS VERY HEAVILY BURROW TURBATED

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
AND ITREPRESENTS
 A CONDENSED SECTION.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
ABOVE US WE CAN SEE CLINOFORMS
WHICH ARE THE RESULT

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
OF HIGHSTAND PROGRADATION,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
OF SHEDDING
 OF SURPLUS MATERIAL.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
AND BETWEEN
THOSE TWO PARTS WE CAN PUT

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
MAXIMUM FLOODING SURFACE
WHEN THE CARBONATE FACTORY

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
WAS RETREATED TOWARD
THE INNER PART OF THE RAMP.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
OK.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
RIGHT, LET'S NOW GO
AND LOOK AT THE CLINOFORMS

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
AND SEE WHAT THEY CONSIST OF.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
OK.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
SKELTON:
OVER HERE ONE CAN SEE

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
THESE NICELY
SHARPLY BASED UNITS

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
WITH A CONCENTRATION
 OF VERY EVIDENT RUDIST DEBRIS.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
I CAN SEE IT FROM HERE,
 IT'S FULL OF MASSES

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
OF BROKEN-UP
 RUDIST DEBRIS,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
PASSING UP, I SUPPOSE,
 TO BIOCLASTIC MATERIAL

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
BEFORE THE NEXT UNIT.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
I GUESS THESE ARE THE RESULTS
OF SINGLE STORM EVENTS

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
WHERE RUDIST DEBRIS WAS SWEPT
OVER ONTO THE CLINOFORMS,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
SO IF WE MOVE BACK
TO THE MAIN WALL HERE,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
WE CAN SEE
 THE INCLINED CLINOFORMS

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
GRADUALLY BECOMING LESS STEEP
 AS WE GO UPWARDS UNTIL WE REACH

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
AT THE TOP THERE I CAN SEE
 FROM HERE A SERIES

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
OF MORE OR LESS HORIZONTAL
 RUDIST BIOSTROMES

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
WHICH WILL BE THE SAME
 AS THE ONES WE SAW AT FRAAKER,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
OF COURSE THE SOURCE
 OF ALL THE MATERIAL

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
THAT WE SEE
 IN THE CLINOFORMS.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
NARRATOR: TO RECAP,
 THE CONDENSED BED

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
WITH THE BURROWS
 REPRESENTS THE CULMINATION

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
OF THE TRANSGRESSIVE
 SYSTEMS TRACT,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
WITH THE MAXIMUM FLOODING
 SURFACE AT ITS TOP,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
WHILE THE CLINOFORMS
 MARK THE INCEPTION

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
OF THE HIGHSTAND
 SYSTEMS TRACT,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
INVOLVING PROGRADATION
 AND SHALLOWING

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
AS THE HIGHSTAND SHEDDING
 OFSHELLY DEBRIS

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
DERIVED FROM THE RUDIST MEADOWS
 STARTED TO FILL IN

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
THE ACCOMMODATION SPACE.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
WELL, THESE MARKS LOOK
INTERESTING. WHAT ARE THESE?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
THESE ARE OLD
ROMAN CHISEL MARKS

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
BECAUSE THEY EXCAVATED
 THE STONE BY CUTTING DEEP,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
VERY DEEP GUTTERS
 BETWEEN BLOCKS.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
AND THEY WERE CHISELED
IN ONE DIRECTION AND THEN

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION,
SO THEY MADE

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
SOMETHING LIKE
HERRINGBONE STRUCTURE.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
AND AFTER THAT, THEY WERE ABLE
TO CUT THE LOWER PART

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
MAINLY BY PHYSICAL
DISCONTINUITIES,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
BY BEDDING PLANES
BETWEEN TWO BLOCKS.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
AND WHERE DID
THIS STUFF END UP?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
DID THAT GO TO THE ARENA?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
YES, THIS IS THE...
 THE MAIN QUARRY FROM WHERE

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
THE MOST OF THE MATERIAL
 FOR ARENA WAS EXCAVATED.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
NARRATOR: FURTHER SOUTH
 ALONG THE COAST, AT TASELERA

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
ON THE SOUTHERNMOST
 HEADLAND OF ISTRIA,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
THE REMAINING TOPMOST PART

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
OF THE HIGHSTAND SYSTEMS TRACT
 CAN BE FOUND.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
HERE WE ARE, QUITE A BIT HIGHER
IN THE HIGHSTAND SYSTEMS TRACT.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
HERE WE CAN SEE
SMALL SCALE CYCLES,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
WE CAN SEE
 THIN BEDDED LIMESTONES.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
IT MEANS WE ARE
 AGAIN IN AN INNER PART

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
OF THE PLATFORM
 WITH LOWER ENERGY.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
THAT'S INTERESTING ACTUALLY,
BECAUSE IF WE LOOK

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
AT THE RUDISTS DOWN HERE,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
WE DON'T SEE
 ANY RECUMBENTS

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
SUCH AS WE SAW AT FRAAKER,
OR VINKURAN, THOUGH.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
JUST ELEVATOR RUDISTS
 AND EVEN THESE ARE MUCH SMALLER

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
THAN THE ONES
 WE SAW EARLIER

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000
WITH QUITE THIN SHELLS,
CLUSTERED HERE IN BOUQUETS.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
VLAHOVICH: HERE IS ANOTHER
 INTERESTING FASCIES

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
OF THIS LOCALITY. THESE ARE
CHONDRODONTID BIVALVES,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
WHICH ARE FOUND BOTH IN
THEIR PRIMARY GROWTH POSITION.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
ORIENTED VERTICALLY
WITHIN THE SEDIMENT.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
YES, AND REWORKED
BY OCCASIONAL STORMS.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
SKELTON: AND THERE THEY'RE
 FORMING FLAT SHEETS OF SHELLS.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
VLAHOVICH: YES.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
NARRATOR:
 TELLING PROOF OF A RETURN

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
TO EXTREMELY SHALLOW CONDITIONS

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
CAN BE SEEN TOWARDS THE TOP
 OF THE HIGHSTAND SYSTEMS TRACT,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
EXPOSED ON
 A NEARBY SMALL ISLAND,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
WHERE DINOSAUR FOOTPRINTS RUN

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
RIGHT ACROSS THE TOP
 OF A RUDIST BIOSTROME.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
IN THE AREA OF MEDULIN,
 TO THE SOUTH-EAST OF PULA,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
A DISTINCT CHANGE IN
 THE CHARACTER OF THE SEDIMENTS

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
AND FOSSILS MARKS
 A NEW PHASE OF DEEPENING,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
AND THUS THE BEGINNING
 OF A NEW MINORSEQUENCE.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
IGOR, THIS FACIES HERE
IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
FROM WHAT WE.VE BEEN
 LOOKING AT LOWER DOWN.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
HERE WE SEEM TO HAVE SCATTERED
AMMONITES, A PELAGIC FAUNA,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
WHICH WOULD SUGGEST DROWNING
 OF OUR PLATFORM.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
THE AGE OF THIS HORIZON?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
THESE AMMONITES
ARE VERY SCARCE. BUT BELOW THEM

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
WE'VE GOT PLANKTONIC
FORAMINIFERA AND CALCIFEROUS,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
AND ON THE BASIS OF
PLANKTONIC FORMANINIFERA

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
WE ARE DEFINITELY SURE
THAT BELOW THIS LEVEL

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
THE ROCKS ARE OF
 THE UPPER CENOMANIAN AGE.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
SO ABOVE THIS LEVEL,
THE ROCKS ARE OF THE TURONIAN.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
AND THE AMMONITES?

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
THE AMMONITES,
MOST OF THEM

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
ARE ALREADY TURONIAN,
 BUT ALSO THERE ARE

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
SOME UPPERMOST
 CENOMANIAN FORMS.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000
SO THE DROWNING THEN
HAS STARTED TO OCCUR HERE,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
A BIT BEFORE THE
CENOMANIAN-TURONIAN BOUNDARY,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
WHICH IS WHEN WE SEE DROWNING

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
IN MANY OTHER PARTS
 OF THE WORLD.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
DURING THE
CENOMANIAN-TURONIAN BOUNDARY,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
THE MOST
OF THE PLATFORM WAS ROUND,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000
SO AT, I WOULD SAY
ABOUT 80% OF THE PLATFORM AREA

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
WAS ROUND BY THIS EVENT.
BUT...

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
BUT THAT WAS EUSTATIC.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
THAT WAS EUSTATIC, YES.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
BUT ALSO AT THE SAME MOMENT,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
WE GET SOME
SMALL ISOLATED AREAS

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
WHICH WERE, WITH CONTINUOUS
SHALLOW WATER DEPOSITION

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
FROM CENOMANIAN-TURONIAN,
AND IN SOME PLACES,

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
LIKE IN NORTHERN ISTRIA
OR IN NORTHERN PART

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
OF THE NEIGHBORING
ISLAND OF TRIES, WE GOT EMERGES,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
SO IT MEANS WE GOT
FALSE REGRESSION,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
DURING THE SAME PERIOD
WHEN WE HAD

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
THIS EUSTATIC
SEA LEVEL RISE.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
SO THAT.S ALSO INFLUENCE OF THE
LOCAL SYN-SEDIMENTARY TECTONICS.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
SO WE'RE GETTING
A TECTONIC ALTERATION

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
OF THE EUSTATIC PATTERN,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
AND HERE,
THEREFORE PRESUMABLY,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
SUBSIDENCE IS BEGINNING
JUST A BIT BEFORE

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
THE CENOMANIAN-TURONIAN
BOUNDARY.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
OK, THAT.S INTERESTING.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
NARRATOR:
 SO, A SIMILAR COMBINATION

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
OF EUSTATIC SEA LEVEL RISE
 AND TECTONIC MOVEMENT

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
TO THE ONE WHICH OCCURRED
 IN THE LATEST ALBIAN SEQUENCE

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
WAS THEN REPEATED
 IN THE LATE CENOMANIAN

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
TO PROVIDE THE ACCOMMODATION
 SPACE FOR A NEW SEQUENCE.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
AND SO, NOW WE KNOW

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
WHERE THE ROMANS
GOT THEIR STONE FROM

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
TO BUILD THE ARENA.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
AND WHO MADE THAT STONE.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
INDEED.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
LET.S NOW SUMMARIZE
THE MAIN POINTS OF THE PROGRAM.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
ESSENTIALLY WHAT
WE WERE CONCERNED WITH

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
WAS THE DYNAMIC
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
THE BIOLOGICAL
CARBONATE FACTORY

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
OF A CRETACEOUS
CARBONATE PLATFORM,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
AND THE FACTORS
THAT PROVIDED

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
THE ACCOMMODATION
SPACE FOR ITS GROWTH.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
THE PARTICULAR SUCCESSION
THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
CAME FROM
 THE NORTH-WESTERN PART

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
OF THE ADRIATIC
 CARBONATE PLATFORM.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
AT THAT TIME
 IN THE MID-CRETACEOUS,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
THIS WAS
 AN ISOLATED PLATFORM

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
IN THE CENTRAL PART
 OF THE TETHYS OCEAN.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
IN ISTRIA ITSELF,
 WE FIND THAT

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
THE SUCCESSION
 EXPOSED AT THE SURFACE

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
RUNS FROM THE MIDDLE JURASSIC
 TO THE PALEOGENE,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
AND CAN BE DIVIDED
 INTO FOUR LONG-TERM SEQUENCES.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
WE CONCENTRATED
 OUR ATTENTION ON THE THIRD

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
OF THESE LONG-TERMSEQUENCES,
 AND WE STARTED

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
AT THE UNCONFORMITY
 THAT MARKS ITS BASE,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
WHERE LOWER APTIAN LIMESTONES
 HAVE BEEN CAUSTICALLYERODED

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
AND OVERLAIN BY
 A FOSSIL SOIL, THEN FOLLOWED

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
BY SHALLOW MARINE DEPOSITS
OF LATE ALBIAN AGE.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
WE THEREFORE STARTED
 OUR INVESTIGATION

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
WITH EXTREMELY
 SHALLOW WATER DEPOSITS

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
OF LATEST ALBIAN AGE
 CONTAINING PERITIDAL CYCLES,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE,
 THE STROMATOLITES

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
WHICH WERE INDICATIVE
 OF A DEPOSITION

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
IN THE INTERTIDAL
 OR EVEN SUPERTIDAL ZONE.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
ABOVE THEM
CAME THE DEPOSITS

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
OF THE TRANSGRESSIVE
SYSTEMS TRACT OF THE SEQUENCE,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
WITH EVIDENCE
FOR PROGRESSIVE DEEPENING.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
SO WE SAW HUMMOCKY
CROSS-STRATIFICATION

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
INDICATING THE OFFSHORE
 TRANSITION ZONE,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
AND FINISHING OFF
 WITH A HIGHLY CONDENSED UNIT

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
THAT HAD BEEN
 HEAVILY BURROWED

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
BUT WERE THE
 THALASSONOIDES BURROWS.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
ABOVE THE MAXIMUM
FLOODING SURFACE,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
WE SEE THE BEGINNING OF
THE HIGHSTANDS SYSTEMS TRACT,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
THE REGRESSIVE EPISODE
 REPRESENTED BY

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
THE GROWTH OF CLINOFORMS
 TOWARDS THE SOUTH-EAST

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
AND EFFECTIVELY
 FILLING IN THIS ZONE

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
OF INTRA-PLATFORM DEPRESSION.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000
AS THE CLINOFORMS EXTENDED
FURTHER TOWARDS THE SOUTH-EAST,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
OUR HIGHSTANDS SYSTEMS TRACT
IN THE AREA THAT WE LOOKED AT

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
BECAME SHALLOWER AND SHALLOWER,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
AND SO WE SAW THIN BIOSTROMES
 OF JUST ELEVATOR RUDISTS

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
WITH RELATIVELY THIN SHELLS
 ANDSMALL SIZE,

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
TOGETHER WITH
 THE CHONDRODON BIVALVES.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
AND VERY NICE EVIDENCE
 FOR THE RETURN

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
OF EXTREMELY
 SHALLOW CONDITIONS IN THE FORM

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
OF THE DINOSAUR FOOTPRINTS
 ACROSS THE TOP

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
OF ONE OF THESE
 RUDIST BIOSTROMES.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
FINALLY,
THIS SHALLOW PLATFORM SYSTEM

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000
THEN DROWNED AGAIN
IN THE LATEST CENOMANIAN.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
AND THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
WERE THESE PELAGIC DEPOSITS
CONTAINING THE AMMONITES,

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
MARKING THE BEGINNING OF
 A NEW SEQUENCE OF DEPOSITION.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
SO OVERALL THEREFORE,
WE HAVE SEEN A PATTERN

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
OF EXTREMELY
DYNAMIC INTERPLAY BETWEEN

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000
A POTENTIALLY HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE
BIOLOGICAL CARBONATE FACTORY

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
AND THE PROVISION OF
ACCOMMODATION SPACE

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
BY A COMBINATION OF
EUSTATIC SEA LEVEL CHANGE

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
AND IMPORTANT
TECTONIC MOVEMENTS.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
OK, IGOR...
[SPEAKS RUSSIAN]

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
YOU'RE WELCOME.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
