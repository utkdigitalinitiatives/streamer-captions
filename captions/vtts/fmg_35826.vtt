the same? Science is beginning

Gone are the days when men and

if you want to get along, you

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
have to talk. But most couples

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
spend less than 15 minutes a

can't wait until those minutes

are over.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And who do they blame for the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
pressure to talk? That's right.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And the more women want to talk,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the more men take cover.

I'm most often asked: "How much

cultural in origin, learned over

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
in words is of no importance."

read without problems."

- What we're seeing in this

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
situation is that the women are

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
reading the whole word.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
They're focusing on the shape of

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
the word rather than the

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
individual constituents of the

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
words, the mixed up letters,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
which is why they're able to

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
continue on and read these

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
things much better than

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000

Oh God!

- The other thing we must

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
consider here is that women also

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
read more than men. So there

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
maybe a practice effect

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
here as well.

- Two out of the 3 women were

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
able to easily ready the jumbled

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000

do it at all.

We may not know why women are

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
better at language, but we can

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
see the proof of it every day,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
as more and more women dominate

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
fields that highlight

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
language skills.

public people.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
- We do what we're good at.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And so if we're good at

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
language, we tend to do things

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
that are easy for us to do.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
- I find it a very

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
happy coincidence.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
- Twice as many women work in

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
the fields of public relations

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and communications. 75% of

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
primary and secondary school

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
teachers are women. More than

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
90% of librarians are women.

[ Applause ]

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Is all of this proof that women

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
are naturally at ease with

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
language and that men are

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
secretly struggling?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
- I'm not a reader, I've never

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
been a reader. I read

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
newspapers, I read magazines.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Reading novels? I don't have the

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
patience to get through all of

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
that language and all of that

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
stuff. I'm more a person who

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
really likes to get to

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
the point.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
- We have to come to a consensus

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
of one great subject.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
- We're going to do a bit of

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
brainstorming to try to

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
come up with ideas.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
- And the theme is,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
"to have or have not."

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
- That is the question.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
- That is the question.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
- Women's ease with language has

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
helped them be creative with

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
words, and quick too.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
For our second exercise, our

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
participants think they're going

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
to learn how to write for radio.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
What we're really trying to see

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
is who can be more creative

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
with language.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
- So, to have or have not.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
To have or have not, what?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
- It's a theme that allows you a

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
lot of room, I think.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
- You gotta remember that to do

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
this sort of thing, we got to

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
have something that's going to

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
interest our audience...

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
- Do we have to pick a side, or

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
is it that whole "to have or

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
have not"? Are we picking

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
a side?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
- You mean, "Do you want to be

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
rich or poor?" Is that it?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
- That's a pretty easy choice.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
- There's an old thing about

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
writing: write about

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
what you know.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
- The guys are not going to like

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000

- Oh, we're in trouble. We lost.

even written language has a sex.

A professor at the University of

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Texas studying student diaries,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
wrote a computer program that

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
can tell the sex of a writer.

really see differences.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
They felt different. You could

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
tell if a story was by a man or

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
a woman almost always. You could

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
feel it, but you couldn't put

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
your finger on it. I just didn't

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
know... I knew there were

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
differences, I just didn't see

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
them. It wasn't until we had

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
this computer program, and pow,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
they start popping out.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
A woman will often use words

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
like, "I think, I feel."

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And males are more likely to

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
just say the fact.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Females also use more social

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
words in general. So they'll

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
talk about family, friends.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
They'll use words that we call

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
communication verbs. Words like

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
talk, listen, etc., at much

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
higher rates than males.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Those kinds of words are used to

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
make a closer connection between

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
the speaker and the listener.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Part of it is women are

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
interested in human beings much

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
more than males are. Men use

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
"we" in this fascinating way.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And they use it at fairly high

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
rates, which is the way I talk

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
to my son. "You know Nick, we

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
need to take out the trash,"

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000

"You need to take out the

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
trash." Listen to male

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
politicians. They use "we" a

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
lot, but it's this kind of

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
distanced we. You don't know who

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
the "we" really is. It's not

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
this warm, inclusive,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
fuzzy kind of "we".

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
lenses. Is it biological?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Beats me. I'd probably put a

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
little money on it. But there

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
are differences.

two forces. One is closeness-

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
distance. Are we the same?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Are we different? How close are

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
we? How distant are we? And then

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
there's also the hierarchy

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
dynamic. We're also balancing

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
best friend, you spend a lot of

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
time talking, telling secrets...

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Talk is the glue that keeps

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
relationships together.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
It's your way that you monitor

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
how close or distant you are.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Boys tend to socialize very

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
differently. They play in larger

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
groups. It's the activity that's

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
central. And they're very

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
attuned not to who's in, who's

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
out, but who's up, who's down.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
- The measure of success.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
- The measure of success?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
- Yes!

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
- Well, we're talking about to

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
have or have not, so having is

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
often equated with being

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
successful, but that's not

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
necessarily so because a lot of

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
people can have the Mercedes and

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
have the big house and have the

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
maids and servants and whatever

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and be miserable in their lives.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
- When women use language,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
they're creating a community

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
within the group, and

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
acknowledging the presence of

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
others and acknowledging that

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
what they're saying is important

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and valid.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
- I know if you said to the

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
guys, "measure of success",

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
they're going to say money, how

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
much they know about sports,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
what their golf score is,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
what they shoot in golf.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
That's going to automatically

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
come out of their mouth.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
They don't think the same way

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
that we do in terms of success.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
- OK, but let's think of

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
something else.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
- When men are speaking to each

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
other, it tends to be very

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
agentic, that is to show

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
mastery of a skill, to make the

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
group... to vie for leadership

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
of the group, for instance.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
- You can talk about children...

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
- All right, children.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
- A job, even. You can talk

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
about goals.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
- To have or have not

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
left your mark.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
- OK.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
- For men to be successful at

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
mating, they generally have to

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
have resources or power. This is

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
what the evolutionary

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
psychologists have found time

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and time again.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
- We've got sports, money...

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
You were just like bursting out

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
there. What were you

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
saying? Women?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
- A job. Just a job...

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
- Sports, which is power and

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
money. Money, which is power and

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
money. And career, which can be

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
power and money. And in fact

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
the women discard those items

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
right away.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
- It doesn't take money to be

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
happy, but a man will have a

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
hard time agreeing with that.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
- So when you think to have or

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
have not, sports, you're

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
thinking what?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
- What would I do on Sundays if

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I didn't have sports?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
[ Chuckling ]

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
- I agree, but my wife's found

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
many things for me.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
[ All laughing ]

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
- In our exercise, the men came

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
up with 10 different subjects;

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
the women, with only one, albeit

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
with several variations. Not the

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
result most studies would

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
predict. But maybe something

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
else was at play here.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
- The women were trying to

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
develop a communal attitude

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
towards each other. They were

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
valuing each other's points.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And so while they were only

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
developing one topic, they're

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
going very deeply into the topic

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
as a way of almost getting to

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
know each other.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
- I speak the most at home.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
My God, I never shut up.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
I babble. I talk a lot, all the

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
time, no matter what.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
- I'm a good listener.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
- Yes. He has to be,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
he has no choice.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
- You have 30 seconds to say...

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
- ...as many words as you can

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
that start with "Th". Go.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
- If you want to see the effects

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
of sex differences in language,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
look no further than school,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
where boys are seriously

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
lagging behind.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
In primary school, boys are

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
twice as likely as girls to have

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
trouble reading and writing,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
and it's not just in Canada.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
It's happening in every

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
developed country in the world.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Girls get higher grades than

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
boys, they drop out half as

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
often, and they get more post-

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
secondary degrees. Three cheers

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
for girls. But what's this

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
doing to boys?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
- Extra! Extra!

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
- How does this language gap

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
come about? Could females have a

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
hormonal advantage? To find out,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
a Cambridge University

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
researcher analyzed the

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
concentration of the hormone

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
testosterone in the amniotic

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
fluid of pregnant women.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
- We had about 70 mothers who

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
were all having amniocentesis,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
where they take the amniotic

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
fluid from the womb.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
So we measured the testosterone.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Comes from both the male and

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
female fetus, and later we

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
followed the child when they

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
were 18 months old to see the

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
size of their vocabulary.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
We found that in children that

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
had higher levels of pre-natal

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
testosterone had a smaller

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
vocabulary. We think there may

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
be a link between the hormone,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
brain, and language, because the

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
more testosterone the fetus is

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
producing, the faster the right

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
hemisphere of the brain

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
develops, and correspondingly,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
the slower the left hemisphere.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
And of course language is

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
usually in the left hemisphere.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
So it may just be that this

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
hormone is affecting language

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
development by affecting the

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
rate of the development of the

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
left hemisphere.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
- Boys get a big boost of

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
testosterone when they reach

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
adolescence. Could this

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
account for all those

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
grunting monosyllables?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000

getting warmed up for an

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000

- Thatch, thumb.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
- "Th" is actually a huge word

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
category. And what we think is

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
going on, is that they're able

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
to access these categories of

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
words more rapidly. Maybe they

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
overlap more for women then they

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
- Thigh... Uh...

[ Speaking rapidly ]

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
- What is interesting as well to

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
note in this, is how quickly

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
they go through similar things.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
So the one woman starts with

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
"that, this, those", etc.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
- Thou, thee,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
thus, therefore...

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
- Thoroughly. But I've

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
said that about 14 times.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
- And then once they move onto a

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
different category, then boom,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
boom, boom. And you can see them

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
skipping from category to

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
category more quickly then

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
the men are.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
- Thank you.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
- Thank you! That's a good one.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Thank, think, thunk.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
- Th.. Th...

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
- That's it! All right.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
- That was brutal.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
- That was brutal.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
- In just 30 seconds, the men's

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
team were able to say about

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
20 words starting with "Th",

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
while the women were able to say

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
39, almost twice as many.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000
- This ability to generate lists

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
of words that are related to

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
each other may in fact be

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
innate. We see that this happens

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
very early in development.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Little girls are much better at

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
this than little boys. And we

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
see changes with hormones as

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
well, suggesting that this is

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
probably something that's

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
not necessarily learned

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
or practiced.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
- I most often hear from women

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
it's all cultural, and if you

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
say there's anything biological,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
it's because you're putting

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
women down and you're trying to

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
hold women back. And it's most

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
often from men that I hear it's

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
all biological and if you say

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
there's a cultural component,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
it's like you're trying to blame

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
me that women aren't all the

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
CEOs, when I know that it's

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
really biological. My personal

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
opinion, and it is really only

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
an opinion, is that it's

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
probably an inextricable

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
combination of cultural and

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
biological factors.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
- In language, as in other

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
behaviors, it's difficult to

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
separate culture from biology,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
nature from nurture.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Take something as common as

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
toys. Why do girls play with

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
dolls, and boys with trucks?

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
A psychologist at Texas A&M

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
University did research on toy

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
choice using monkeys.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
- We were interested in

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
determining if there were

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
factors other than socialization

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
that could contribute to

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
children's preferences for toys.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
So what we decided to do was go

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
to a species where we knew that

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
there weren't these social

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
pressures to play with

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
particular toys.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
A monkey does not know the

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
functional significance of the

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
truck. For that matter, the

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
doll. And if they showed

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
preferences that were similar

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
to children, then we could

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
argue that there were factors

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
other than socialization

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
that contributed to

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
those differences.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
What we found was that the

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
preferences that monkeys show

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
were very similar to the

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
preferences that children show.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
That the boys preferred the

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
truck and the females

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
preferred the doll.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
It has strengthened my belief

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
that biological and social

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
factors may work in a

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
complementary fashion in

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
some instances. That we are

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
socializing people in a way that

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
is consistent with these little

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
pushes that we might get from

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
biological factors. So they're

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
not really in opposition,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
which makes it really hard to

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
tease them apart.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
- Our culture is something that

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
we learn from the time

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
we're very small. And I think

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
many of us prefer that it be

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
cultural so that we can change

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
it. And in fact, cultural

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
conditioning is very hard to

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
change. But at the same time we

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
can change cultural conditioning

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
if we try really hard. But we

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
can also change what's

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
biologically given. So it's a

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
question that's intriguing to

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
think about, but it's probably

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
more important to understand

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
what are the patterns so that we

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
know how to deal with them, than

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
it is to try to pick apart which

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
part comes from what.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
- And technology hasn't changed

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
anything. Research shows that

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
women use the telephone twice

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
as much as men.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
And man, the tool-user, prefers

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
to commune with his gadgets.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
So even if the tools have

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
changed, men and women still

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
maintain their age-old divide.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
and I've come up with a few

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
patterns that might

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
explain this frustration.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
So the typical situation for

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
little girls when they're

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
talking to each other, and you

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
see this among adult women too,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
is to look right at each other,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
keep this direct face-to-face

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
gaze, lean in. And so it's this

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
very focused gaze. And among

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
little boys, older boys, and

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
men, the pattern that I found is

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
they typically will sit at

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
angles, or even side-by-side.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Now, if you have a woman talking

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
to a man, and she keeps looking,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
trying to get him to look at

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
her, and he's looking somewhere

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
else, she thinks he's not

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
listening because he's not

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
looking at her. Sometimes of

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
course, he may not be listening,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
but the very fact of not looking

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
does not seem to carry that

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
meaning of not listening for men

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
as it does for women.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
- So sometimes it may look like

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
a man isn't listening,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000
but his brain is still

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
processing language.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
[ Woman clears throat ]

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
[ Laughter ]

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Well, not always.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Thanks to research using the

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
latest in magnetic resonance

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
imagery, we can now pinpoint the

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
exact part of the brain that men

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
and women use to understand

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
language. The experiment

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
involved listening to an audio

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
tape, first backwards,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
and then forwards.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
- We compare what the brain does

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
when listening to the story

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
forward, to what the brain does

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
listening to the story backward.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000
And the reason why that's

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
important is because when you

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
listen to a story forward, you

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
have comprehension of language,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
because it's normal speech.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
When you listen to it backwards,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
you have the exact same sounds,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
and everything else that your

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
brain does to process that

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
sound, expect for the

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
comprehension of speech.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
So we're able to select out

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
the areas of brain that

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
are responsible for

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
comprehensive speech, or

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
understanding language.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
One of the things we noticed

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
early on was that we got a

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
different response when we put

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
men in and when we put women in.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Men tended to show this very

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
localized activity in the left

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
side of the brain, which is the

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
traditional area that we think

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
of as being dominant for

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
listening or dominant for

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
speech. Women tended to show

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
activity on both sides of their

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
brain in this area of the

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
temporal lobe, which is

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
responsible for listening to

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
language. This result suggests

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
that the normal structures used

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
for men and women in listening

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
are probably different. And that

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
may indicate a different process

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
inside the brain.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
- Like the process inside the

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
corpus callosum, the part of the

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
brain that transmits information

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
from one hemisphere to the

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000
other, women have a greater

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
number of nerve fibres

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
connecting the two sides.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
- There may be some differences

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
in brain development between men

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
and women. That's been suggested

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
by people in the past, and the

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
debate has gone back and forth

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
for a long time.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
- So, do these biological

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
differences make women

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
better listeners?

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
- As a man with a wife and

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
4 daughters, I've been told on

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
multiple occasions that I don't

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
listen as well as other people,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
so from that standpoint, yes.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
That's a personal observation,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
but it says nothing about the

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
native ability of men or women

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
to listen to things.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
- He and Nick Auf der Mar...

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
- And how well will our

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
participants listen, especially

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
when they have to talk at the

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
same time?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
- Alan, you're on.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
- Thanks Jon, for coming.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
- Nice to be here.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
- Uh, I know you've been a

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
veteran journalist for

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
30 years now...

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
- ...come into the business

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
all over again.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
- Rita, your voice sounds a

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
little dry. Take a sip of water.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
- Do you think that you have to

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
become better as a broadcaster

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
because you're an older female?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
- Good question.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
- So there's a challenge as

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
being a woman...

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
- Christine, that's enough on

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
gender challenges.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Talk about age.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
- Is there an age challenge as

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
well in broadcasting?

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
- Along the way--

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
- OK Robert, skip to the next

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
question. Go with the next

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
question right now.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
- Sorry. Heh heh! How do you

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
feel about the, speaking of

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
news, how do you feel about the

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
news coverage in Iraq...

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
- There is expressive

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
and receptive language.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Expressive is what I'm doing

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
right now. Receptive is

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
listening. And these take part

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
in different parts of your

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
brain. And so to be able to

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
listen and speak at the same

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
time, actually requires an

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
integration of these two parts

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
of your brain. And we see that

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
men are having a harder time

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
doing this.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
- You said something--

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
- Sean, you have sweat on your

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
right earlobe. Wipe it off.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Go on. Go on with the interview.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
- Is it still there?

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
- The show must go on, Sean.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Ask the next question.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
- OK.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
- So...

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
- Linda, uncross your legs and

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
remember to look Francine

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
in the eyes.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
[ Linda talking at same time ]

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
- ...pleasant parts of your

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
career was your stint with the

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
magazine La Vie en Rose. And why

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
was that?

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
- What about...

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
- OK, Alan, go to

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
the last question.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
- ...in terms of...

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
- We're short on time.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
- ...what's happening today.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
What do you see happening to

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
journalism in the future?

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
- 3 out of 3 of our female

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
participants figured out how to

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
deal with the earphone, and were

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
able to both listen and speak at

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
the same time. And as for the

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
men, well, they didn't

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
do so well.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
- It's not easy when somebody's

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
speaking to you.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
- Oh my God. You gotta learn to,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
"Shut up back there!"

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
- "Jump to the last question."

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Oh, all right.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
- You just lost a couple of

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
years from your life, but you

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
did a good job.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
- It's not as easy as I...

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
- So, if men can't listen to two

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
things at once, it isn't their

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
fault, it's just the way their

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
brains work.

[ Horses on TV, music ]

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
- If I'm listening to the radio,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
and I want to talk, I just turn

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
down the radio, and then I talk.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
So that kind of superfluous

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
noise bothers me. I could never

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
study in school while the radio

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
was on or the television was on.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
It's got to be one thing

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
at a time.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
- I can cook and speak at the

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
same time, and sweep at the same

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
time, and change the radio and

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
even sing at the same time.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
- I can't cook, period.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
- So, this exercise...

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
- We're going to have a debate.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
- What do you think should be

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
the number one quality...

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
- We're getting to

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
meet the women.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
- ...a journalist should have.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
- Meet and beat the women, I'd

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
like to point out.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
- In situations like a dinner

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
party, women can be

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
surprisingly intimate.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000
But this is an environment where

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
men really open up.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
- I think many women feel quite

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
cautious about talking in a

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
public situation. You might say

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
the wrong thing. You might hurt

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
somebody's feelings. You might

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
spark a conflict which you'd

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000
like to avoid. People might be

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
critical of you. They might

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
accuse you of talking too much.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
For him, it's just the opposite.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Everything about the boy's

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
socialization encourages them to

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
put themselves forward

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
in that group.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
- To find out more about the

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
difference between public and

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
private language, we asked our

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
participants to take part in a

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
debate. What we'll be observing

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
is which sex is more at ease

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
speaking in public.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
- OK, we've selected the ability

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
to communicate as the key

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
characteristic for a good

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
journalist because essentially,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
communication is the nucleus of

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
this profession. You have to be

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
able to take an idea, to

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
articulate it, to sell it to

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
your audience, and to get your

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
point across in a succinct and

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
clear manner as possible. In a

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
nutshell. Thank you.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
[ Applause ]

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
- Well, that's true. I guess

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
what we feel is, "Why do we

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
watch the news in the first

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
place?" Because we need to be

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
informed. The number one quality

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
of a journalist of any form, we

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
feel, is knowledge.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
- We know that men speak more

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
often in public and more

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
frequently. So not only do they

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
speak for longer periods of

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
time, but they're more likely to

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
interrupt each other,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
or other women.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
- You may be able to communicate

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
a story, but if you don't know

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
anything about it, what are you

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
communicating? You know

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
what I mean?

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
- Hello, research? You go out

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
and you do your research.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
You don't have to

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
already know it.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
- That's knowledge.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
- No, that's going to acquire

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
knowledge. Why are you going to

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
acquire knowledge?

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
- That's secondary,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
it's not primary.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
- The goals of public speech for

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
women is often to establish

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
intimacy and to show communion

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
with each other, that "Yes, I

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
understand what you're saying.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
I might be different, but I

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
value your position."

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
- There's absolutely no denying

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
that knowledge and gathering

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
knowledge is key to the ability

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
to communicate well.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
But essentially the role of a

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
journalist is to get a point

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
across. Would you disagree?

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
- The goals for men are a little

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
different, subtly different.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
They're to dominate each other

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
to establish hierarchy. So I can

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
perhaps say to you, "Yes, your

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
idea is fine, mine is better."

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
- You're presenting very well.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
The 3 of you look very good

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
there. You're presenting very

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
well, but go ahead and talk to

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
me about nuclear physics.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Any one of you. Feel free,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
go ahead.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
- There's a subtle difference

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
there between saying, "Yours is

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
just as good as mine, but I'm

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
sticking with my point" versus,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
"Yours is fine, but mine

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
is better."

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
- If I had the opportunity to do

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
some research on nuclear

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
physics, I could very

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
effectively communicate--

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
- Well, you're just backing up

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000
our point. That's the most

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000
important thing.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
- You got the knowledge first.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
- You need to go find the story.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
- I would have expected that the

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
men would excel at this and that

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000
they would dominate the

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
conversation and take more time

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
than the women would. It's what

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
we see in the research.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
- News is facts.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
- News is facts. Journalism is

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
presenting the facts. Can I just

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
stand up and say that, because I

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
think that's a very valid point.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
News is fact, delivering the

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
news is journalism.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
- No.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
- The women are actually doing

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
OK. In fact, one of the women

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
relies on personal experience

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
with her job to suggest that,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
"No, I actually know this better

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
than you."

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
- I'm a communicator in my real

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
life. I write policy material

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
for a major bank. My job is to

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
gather information and decipher

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
it and translate it in such a

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
way that my audience is going to

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
understand it. So yes, I need

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
to research, I need to know my

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
subject, absolutely. But I need

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
to be able to communicate

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
it effectively.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
- We see that this woman is very

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
confident, very fluent, very

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
elegant in her speech.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
- If you can't understand the

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
message that this person is

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
trying to deliver, even though

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
he's as knowledgeable as

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
can be-- Let me put it to you

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
another way. Because you have

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
all the information that you

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
need on a subject, means you

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
know what you're talking about.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
It does not mean that you know

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
how to talk about it.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
- The fact that the women are

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
becoming more confident may be

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
indicative of some of the

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
changes we're seeing in the

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
workforce, and that our culture

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
is actually changing our

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
abilities, and our abilities to

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
speak in public.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
- We're not saying we're better

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
communicators, we're just saying

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
that's what you need.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
- [Male moderator]: Ladies and

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
gentlemen, I'm glad that we have

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000
picked such a good topic.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Even though we were right...

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000
- Let's take it outside!

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
[ Laughter ]

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
- Although things may be

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
changing in society, in the

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
course of our debate, the men

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
spoke more than the women,

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
used more words, and

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
interrupted more frequently.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Classic differences between men

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
and women in public speech.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000
- I think some people are

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
uncomfortable with the

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000
description of differences

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
between women and men for a

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
number of reasons. For one

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
thing, it seems like we're

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
making too much of them.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
There are so many ways that

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
we're the same, and if we focus

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
on what's different, we're

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
driving a wedge between us.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
There can be a discomfort that

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
what we're describing

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
is "typical"...

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
...can sound like we're saying

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
it's "normal". And so anyone who

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
doesn't fit that typical pattern

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
is being told they're not

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
normal, there's something wrong

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
with you. And I think there can

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
be a discomfort too that if

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
we're saying women and men are

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
different, we may be justifying

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
the inequality in our culture,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
and we may be denying even

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
social injustice. And so it can

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
be heard as, "Well, women and

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
men are different, so if women

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
don't get promoted as often as

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
men do, it's because there's

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
something different about them.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
They don't deserve it, they

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
don't want it, they're not as

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
good at it." I feel it's

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
important to describe the

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
differences if they're there, so

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
that we know what we're

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
dealing with.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
- What about the Internet?

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
That was supposed to be a brave,

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
new, gender-free world where men

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
and women would be equal.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Dr. Susan Herring, a linguist,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
has collected hundreds of posted

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
messages and analyzed the way

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
men and women were writing on

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
the Internet. And she found the

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
brave new world of cyber

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
relations was neither

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
brave nor very equal.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
- I found that there were some

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
very striking differences

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
between the messages of the men

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000
and the women. The women's

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
messages on average were between

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
one and two screens long.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Men's messages were often 10 or

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
even 20 screens long. And women

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
would sometimes apologize if

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
their message was only two

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
screens long. They would say,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
"Sorry for such a long message."

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
But a man, I never saw an

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
example of a man apologizing for

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
the length of a message, even

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
when it was 20 screens long.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Men are more likely to engage in

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
directly challenging statements.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Men are more likely to baldly

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
state, "That's wrong."

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Or, "You're wrong." Women are

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
more likely to hedge or phrase

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
their disagreement indirectly.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
It may be more difficult to tell

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
that women are in fact

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000
disagreeing, because they're

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
phrasing it in such

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
a polite way.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
There are many similarities

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
between what I found in terms

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
of gender differences on the

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Internet, and what other

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
researchers had found previously

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
for spoken language, face-to-

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
face communication. In both

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
cases, we see men being more

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000
confrontational, more

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
comfortable with confrontation,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
than women, and women being more

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
apologetic, more tenuous in

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
their communication style,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000
and also more supportive of

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
one another. So in those

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
senses, I think the patterns

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
are very similar.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Maybe what's most surprising

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
about that, is that there was an

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
expectation that all of that

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
would disappear on the Internet.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
And not only did it not

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
disappear, but it seemed to be

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
perfectly reproduced, which

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
raises interesting questions

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
why people feel the need to

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
reproduce those kinds of almost

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
stereotypical behaviors in a

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000
new environment which actually

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
allows for great anonymity

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
in theory.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Gender is very deeply rooted in

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
all of us. It's a very deep part

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
of our identities, that we don't

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
slough that off so easily.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000

and proved themselves most at

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
ease with language.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000

- Now, is that a surprise?

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
I didn't think so. Language

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
sounds an awful lot like

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
communication, eh?

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000
- Well, there you go, although

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
you were wrong about that point.

[ Laughter ]

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000
- If the differences are there,

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
we need to acknowledge them so

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000
we can address them. If we

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
don't, it's like you're sweeping

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000
something under the rug and

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
eventually you're going to start

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000

- Men may be learning to connect

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
with women and speak their

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
language, but women have had a

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
lot more practice. And if women

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000
have been gabbing away since the

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
dawn of humanity, it shouldn't

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
be a surprise that they're

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
better at it than men, who are

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
never that interested in talking

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
in the first place.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
- Discussing differences isn't

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000
to deny issues of social

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000
justice. It's to have more tools

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
issues and change the things

we're not happy with.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000
- What it all comes down to is

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
that men and women may speak

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
different languages, but we've

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
only just started talking.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
And you know what they say:

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000

more important to understanding

human nature than understanding

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
how people compete and how

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
they cooperate.
