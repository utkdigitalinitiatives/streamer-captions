WEBVTT

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.300
FROM THE BEGINNING OF
HISTORY THE NILE HAS BEEN

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.230
THE LIFEBLOOD OF
ONE OF THE GREATEST

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.960
CIVILIZATIONS
ON EARTH.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
ITS WATERS HAVE FLOWED
AT THE FEET OF ARISTOTLE

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.360
AND CLEOPATRA, JOSEPH
AND MOSES, THE CRUSADERS

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.800
AND THE PHARAOHS
OF ANCIENT EGYPT.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.060
ALL HAVE BATHED
IN THIS STREAM.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.530
THE EGYPTIANS HAVE ALWAYS
BELIEVED THIS RIVER TO BE

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.430
THEIR OWN EXCLUSIVE GIFT FROM
THE GODS AND UP UNTIL RECENTLY

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.460
IT WAS ALLOWED TO FLOW
UNHINDERED TO THEIR LANDS.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.060
BUT NOW ALL THIS
IS SET TO CHANGE.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.000
UPSTREAM, ETHIOPIA IS BUSY
BUILDING DAMS WHICH THREATEN

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.500
TO CUT OFF EGYPT'S WATER
SUPPLY AT THE SOURCE.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.130
MANY OF THE WARS OF THE 20TH
CENTURY WERE ALL ABOUT OIL,

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.400
BUT WARS OF THE 21ST
WILL BE OVER WATER...

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.000
WITH THE NILE, THE LONGEST
RIVER IN THE WORLD,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.900
AT THE CENTER
OF THE CONFLICT.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.060
FRESH RUNNING WATER HAS ALWAYS
BEEN THE LIFEBLOOD OF OUR WORLD

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.330
BUT IS NOW MORE
PRECIOUS THAN EVER.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.630
OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS, THE
AMOUNT OF WATER AVAILABLE

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.430
TO EVERYONE IS EXPECTED
TO DECREASE BY A THIRD.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.130
BUT THIS STORY ISN'T JUST ABOUT
WATER, IT'S ABOUT THE NILE

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.500
AS AN ICON FOR DEEPLY HELD
BELIEFS AND ABOUT A SENSE OF

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.560
BELONGING WHICH STRETCHES
BACK A THOUSAND YEARS.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.200
THIS EPIC JOURNEY WILL FOLLOW
THE RIVER BACK TO ITS SOURCE

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.160
IN ETHIOPIA, AND, AS THE NILE
WINDS ITS WAY BACK HOME,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.460
ITS WATERS WILL WASH
THROUGH THE LIVES OF PEOPLE

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.600
WHO CANNOT
SURVIVE WITHOUT IT.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.000
THE NILE FLOWS FROM THE HEART
OF AFRICA IN TWO MAIN CHANNELS:

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.230
THE WHITE NILE WHICH RISES
FROM LAKE VICTORIA IN UGANDA,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.730
AND THE BLUE NILE WHICH FLOWS
FROM THE MOUNTAINS OF ETHIOPIA

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.360
AND WHICH HAS NOURISHED
THE GROWTH OF EGYPT

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.430
AND ITS CAPITAL, CAIRO.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.030
POUNDING TRAFFIC AND PULSATING
CROWDS FORM THE BACKDROP

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.800
TO AN EXHILARATING MIX
OF PRESENT AND PAST.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.200
AND RIGHT THROUGH IT
ALL FLOWS THE RIVER NILE,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.600
THE LIFELINE AND THE
HEART OF THE CITY.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.400
MOST OF THE CITIZENS HERE
TAKE THIS RIVER FOR GRANTED.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.500
FOR THEM, IT'S A NICE PLACE TO
TAKE A WALK WITH THE FAMILY,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.530
A GREAT LOCATION FOR AN
APARTMENT, OR JUST A PLACE

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.130
FOR A BIT OF PEACE AWAY FROM
THE CACOPHONY OF THE STREETS.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.130
THEY PROBABLY DON'T EVEN
THINK THAT WITHOUT THIS RIVER

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.900
THEY WOULDN'T
EVEN BE HERE.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.660
IN A COUNTRY WITH
HARDLY ANY RAINFALL,

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.030
THE NILE GIVES THE PEOPLE
WATER, WORK, FOOD, LIFE.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.430
FOR SOME, IT ALSO GIVES THEM
A PLACE TO LIVE, LIKE ABDULLAH

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.500
AND HIS FAMILY WHO LIVE ON
THE NILE ALL YEAR ROUND.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.800
TRANSLATOR: OF
COURSE LIFE IS HARD,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.000
ESPECIALLY WHEN
THE WEATHER IS COLD.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.030
SOME PEOPLE LIVE
VERY COMFORTABLY

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.230
AND OTHERS HAVE A
HARD LIFE LIKE US.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.700
BUT WE TRY NOT
TO AIM TOO HIGH.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.900
SOME PEOPLE ARE BORN RICH
AND WE ARE POOR AND HUMBLE.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.200
SUCH IS LIFE.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.800
>>WITH 17 MILLION INHABITANTS
AND STILL GROWING, CAIRO ITSELF

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.100
HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN
SIZE OVER THE PAST 50 YEARS.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.230
THE CITY IS NOW HOME TO NEARLY
THE SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE AS THE

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.860
WHOLE OF AUSTRALIA, ALL IN ONE
CONFINED CHAOTIC SPRAWLING CITY.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.600
THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH
ROOM HERE FOR EVERYBODY

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.360
AND SO SOME PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN PUSHED OFF THE LAND

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.200
AND ONTO THE RIVER.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:24.000
TRANSLATOR: I'VE BEEN BROUGHT
UP IN A BOAT WITH MY FATHER.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.730
I WORKED BESIDE HIM AND WITH
HIM BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.830
AND I GOT MARRIED.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.530
MY WIFE WAS FROM THE
VILLAGE OF EL MENOUFIA.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.500
I TOLD HER THAT SHE COULD STAY
THERE WITH HER PARENTS BUT SHE

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.460
REFUSED AND SAID THAT WE HAVE
TO BE TOGETHER ON THE BOAT.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.100
>>ABDULLAH, SAIFA,
AND THEIR YOUNG FAMILY

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.330
LIVE IN A SMALL
COMMUNITY.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.060
THESE WOODEN BOATS
ARE THEIR HOMES.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.930
THEY FISH ON THEM BY DAY
AND SLEEP IN THEM AT NIGHT.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.800
THEY GET ALL THEIR WATER
DIRECTLY FROM THE RIVER,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.860
WASH THEIR CLOTHES,
BATHE THEIR BABIES IN IT.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.360
THEY ALSO EARN A
MEAGER LIVING FROM IT.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:15.330
TAKING HOME BETWEEN $10 AND
$20 U.S. A DAY FOR THEIR CATCH,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.530
ABDULLAH CAN ONLY BUY THE
BARE NECESSITIES OF LIFE.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.300
THEY COULD NEVER AFFORD
AN APARTMENT OR A HOUSE.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.960
BUT IN SPITE OF THEIR
DIFFICULT LIVING CONDITIONS

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.430
ABDULLAH STILL LOVES
HIS LIFE ON THE NILE.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.330
TRANSLATOR: WHEN MY MOTHER
DIED I REMEMBER HER TELLING ME

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:50.360
HOW I WAS BORN ON THE BOAT
BEFORE BEING TAKEN TO HOSPITAL.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.000
I AM LIKE A FISH.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.830
YOU TAKE ME AWAY FROM
THIS RIVER AND I DIE.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.630
I LOVE THE NILE.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:06.860
>>THIS LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE
NILE LIES AT THE HEART OF THE

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:12.200
EGYPTIAN PSYCHE AND HAS EXISTED
SINCE THE AGE OF THE PHARAOHS

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:18.800
AND THEIR PYRAMIDS.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.330
THESE MONUMENTAL STRUCTURES
ARE ABOUT AN HOUR'S DRIVE AWAY

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.400
FROM THE NILE IN GIZA,
FAR ENOUGH THROUGH THE

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.800
POUNDING TRAFFIC AND HOT
MESSY CAIRO SUBURBS TO SEEM

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:35.430
COMPLETELY DIVORCED FROM
THE RIVER AND ITS CONCERNS.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.900
BUT IT WASN'T
ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:54.430
IN ANCIENT TIMES THE NILE FLOWED
RIGHT BY HERE BECAUSE DURING

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.530
THE SUMMER MONTHS THE RIVER
FLOODED AND BROKE ITS BANKS,

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:03.530
WITH THE FLOOD WATERS REACHING
AS FAR AS GIZA AND BEYOND.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:09.400
THIS NATURALLY RECURRING
PHENOMENON WAS THE SECRET

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:16.000
BEHIND EGYPT'S SUCCESS.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.630
THE LIFE-GIVING FLOODS PROVIDED
THE PHARAOHS WITH A DYNAMIC

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.730
SURGE OF WATER WHICH ALLOWED
THEM TO GROW THEIR CROPS

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:28.300
AND FEED THEIR PEOPLE.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.700
IT ALSO ALLOWED THEM
TO CARRY GIANT ROCKS

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:37.960
SO THAT THEY COULD
BUILD THEIR PYRAMIDS.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.830
THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS HAD
NO IDEA HOW THE FLOODS

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.630
CAME TO THEM DURING
THE HOT SUMMER

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.660
WHEN OTHER NATIONS WITHERED
AND DIED IN THE DRY HEAT

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.960
BUT THEY GAVE THEIR GODS ETERNAL
THANKS FOR THE MIRACLE ON WHICH

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.560
NOT JUST THE PYRAMIDS BUT
THEIR WHOLE NATION WAS BUILT.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.360
AND TO THIS DAY, EVEN THOUGH
THE FLOODS HAVE DRIED UP

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.060
AND THEIR GODS ARE LONG
GONE, THE MONUMENTS

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.300
THAT WERE BUILT IN THEIR
HONOR REMAIN AS TESTIMONY

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:09.900
TO EGYPT'S HISTORIC RIGHT
TO OWN AND CONTROL THE NILE.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:15.860
BUT ANCIENT RIGHTS TO THE
RIVER DON'T ALWAYS ANSWER

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:22.330
THE NEEDS OF
PEOPLE TODAY.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.960
THIS IS A VILLAGE
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF GIZA

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.160
AND RIGHT ON THE
EDGE OF THE DESERT.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.430
COMPARED TO SOME, LOCALS
HERE ARE FAIRLY WELL OFF

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:45.230
BUT THEY STILL HAVEN'T
GOT WHAT THEY NEED MOST...

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:52.200
FRESH RUNNING WATER.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.300
MOST OF THE HOMES HERE HAVE A
TAP, BUT THE MURKY STUFF THAT

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:01.330
COMES OUT OF IT IS JUST TOO
DIRTY TO DRINK AND SO THE LOCALS

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.960
HAVE TO EITHER CARRY THEIR
WATER FROM DISTANT STANDPIPES

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.530
OR BUY THEIR WATER
FROM PRIVATE VENDORS

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:12.200
AT TWICE THE RATE OF
METERED CONSUMPTION.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.960
TRANSLATOR: THE WATER
FROM THE TAPS IS NO GOOD

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.060
FOR DRINKING
AND COOKING.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.530
YOU CAN USE IT FOR DOMESTIC
TASKS BUT MY WATER IS GOOD.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:26.900
THE VILLAGERS CAN USE IT FOR
DRINKING AND COOKING AS WELL.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:33.060
>>SAID MOHAMMED ABDUL IS
THE LOCAL WATER SELLER.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.530
HE USED TO HAVE A SPICE
STALL IN THE LOCAL SOUQ

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.400
BUT SAW AN OPPORTUNITY
TO MAKE MORE MONEY

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.660
SELLING SOMETHING FAR MORE
VALUABLE THAN SAFFRON.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.700
TRANSLATOR: I'VE BEEN
DOING IT FOR EIGHT YEARS.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.860
THE MORE I WORK THE
MORE I GET CLIENTS.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.100
THE INHABITANTS OF THE
VILLAGE, ALL THE CAFES

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:57.800
AND EVERY HOUSEHOLD
NOW BUY MY WATER.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:04.400
>>THE RECENT POPULATION GROWTH
IN EGYPT HASN'T BEEN MATCHED

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.760
BY A GROWTH IN THE
COUNTRY'S INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.830
AND SO, FOR THE PEOPLE
LIVING ON THE OUTSKIRTS

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:16.730
THERE'S A DESPERATE
SHORTAGE OF BASIC FACILITIES.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:23.530
FOR SAID MOHAMMED, HOWEVER,
BUSINESS IS BOOMING,

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:30.800
WITH PEOPLE
THROWING MONEY AT HIM.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.130
THERE ARE 800 WATER
SELLERS IN CAIRO AND GIZA.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.460
WITH THE COUNTRY STILL
GROWING AT AN ALARMING RATE,

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.730
THEY'RE WORKING OVERTIME
TO TRY AND MEET DEMAND.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.100
SO SAID MOHAMMED IS SOON
PLANNING TO BUY ANOTHER

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.600
HORSE AND CART TO
EXPAND HIS BUSINESS.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.530
IT'S EASY TO SYMPATHIZE WITH
EGYPT'S NEED FOR MORE WATER

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.260
AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW
DESPERATELY TRYING TO FIND

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.900
NEW WAYS OF STRETCHING
THE NILE'S SUPPLY

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.730
TO SATISFY THE NEEDS OF
ITS BURGEONING MILLIONS.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.600
BUT SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THE
COUNTRY'S ALREADY USING UP

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.000
MORE THAN ITS
FAIR SHARE.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.030
ITS RIGHT TO ITS OWN WATER
SUPPLY IS NOW BEING CHALLENGED

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.900
BY A DESPERATE AND DETERMINED
NEIGHBOR WHO'S PREPARED TO GO

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:29.730
TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO SECURE
ITS OWN STAKE IN THE NILE.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:33.060
THE SITUATION HAS
NEVER BEEN SO VOLATILE

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.960
AND EGYPT HAS BEEN
THREATENING WAR...

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.430
WITH ETHIOPIA SET
FIRMLY IN ITS SITES.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:51.260
THE NILE IN EGYPT FLOWS ALMOST
ENTIRELY THROUGH DESERT.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.460
APART FROM THE THIN STRIPS
OF GREEN WATERED LAND

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.730
WHICH BORDER THE RIVER ON
EITHER SIDE, THE WHOLE COUNTRY

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:02.360
IS MADE UP OF
INHOSPITABLE WASTELAND.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.930
SINCE THE STONE AGE,
MOST EGYPTIANS HAVE LIVED

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:25.630
VERY CLOSE TO THE NILE,
DEPENDENT ON IT FOR EVERYTHING.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.060
FROM THE URBAN CENTERS
OF CAIRO AND GIZA, THE NILE

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.500
WINDS ITS WAY BACK THROUGH
THE FLATLANDS OF EGYPT TO THE

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.030
AGRICULTURAL REGIONS OF THE
NILE VALLEY WHERE, ONCE AGAIN,

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:48.160
THE RIVER PLAYS A
CENTRAL ROLE IN SOCIETY.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:07.100
HAMMAM AND MOHAMMED ARE
FATHER AND SON FARMERS

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:11.260
WHO OWN A SMALL PIECE OF
LAND IN THE NILE VALLEY.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:18.430
MOHAMMED, HOWEVER, MAY
BE THE LAST OF A LONG LINE.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.660
TRANSLATOR: MY DAD IS A FARMER,
MY GRANDPARENTS AND MY GREAT

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:27.530
GRANDPARENTS WERE FARMERS,
AND I AM A FARMER.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.960
>>HAMMAM AND MOHAMMED
HAVE WORKED TOGETHER

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.230
FROM DAWN TILL DUSK SINCE
MOHAMMED WAS OLD ENOUGH

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:41.200
TO CARRY A FAS (HOE)
OR A MINJAL (SICKLE).

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.060
THE PACE OF LIFE FOR THEM HAS AN
ANCIENT RHYTHM AND THIS SCENE

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:52.000
COULD HAVE BEEN WITNESSED
A THOUSAND YEARS AGO.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.630
THEY INHERITED THEIR SKILLS
AND THEIR TOOLS FROM THEIR

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.300
FOREFATHERS AND USE THE SAME
IRRIGATION CHANNELS AND CANALS

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.160
FIRST COMMISSIONED BY
THE PHARAOHS TO ENSURE

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.830
THAT THE NILE NEVER FAILS
TO REACH THEIR CROPS.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.260
MOHAMMED AND HIS ANCESTORS HAVE
ALWAYS PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE IN

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:31.730
EGYPTIAN LIFE, BUT THEIR AGE-OLD
POSITION IS NOW UNDER THREAT.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:38.030
THE LONGEVITY OF THIS ANCIENT
CIVILIZATION REFLECTS MORE THAN

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:42.530
ANYTHING ELSE THE TIME-HONED
SKILLS OF THESE FARMERS,

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.730
BUT ALSO THE ETERNAL
FERTILITY OF ITS SOIL -

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:50.860
A POWER WHICH IS
UNPARALLELED IN HUMAN HISTORY.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.230
WHERE OTHER CIVILIZATIONS
WITHERED AND DIED AS THEIR SOILS

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:04.000
WERE EXHAUSTED, EGYPT'S LAND
WAS CONTINUOUSLY REPLENISHED

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.400
BY THE ANNUAL FLOODS
WHICH INUNDATED THE COUNTRY

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.000
EVERY YEAR.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.600
THESE FLOODS HAD ALLOWED THE
PHARAOHS TO BUILD THEIR TOMBS,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.560
BUT FAR MORE IMPORTANTLY
THEY GAVE EGYPT

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.860
AN ANNUAL DEPOSIT OF
RICH AND GLORIOUS MUD

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:32.160
FROM WHICH THEY COULD
GROW AN ABUNDANCE OF FOOD.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:37.300
TRANSLATOR: THE NILE
IS EVERYTHING FOR THE

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.900
EGYPTIAN FARMER AND
EVERYTHING FOR THE LAND.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.330
IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS
THE NILE STOOD FLOODED

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.900
FOR THREE MONTHS SO
IT SOFTENED THE SOIL.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.360
THEN, WHEN THE NILE'S
WATER SUBSIDED,

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.060
WE COULD START
CULTIVATING.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.260
>>BUT TIMES
HAVE CHANGED.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:09.200
HUGE DAMMING PROJECTS
UPSTREAM HAVE BEEN BUILT

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.730
TO PROVIDE EGYPT WITH A MUCH
NEEDED SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.360
BUT THEY ALSO STEMMED
THE FLOW OF THE RIVER

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:23.860
AND WRECKED THE LIVES
OF THE EGYPTIAN FARMERS.

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:29.300
EGYPT USED TO HAVE SOME OF
THE BEST SOIL IN THE WORLD

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.960
BUT THE DAMMING SCHEMES
DESTROYED THE SILTING PROCESS

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.300
WHICH HAD NATURALLY
ENRICHED THIS LAND

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.930
FOR THOUSANDS
OF YEARS.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.600
MOHAMMED'S FIELDS NOW
YIELD A VERY POOR RETURN.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.060
TRANSLATOR: WE USED TO GROW
OUR CROPS WITHOUT CHEMICALS

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.060
BUT NOW WE HAVE
TO USE CHEMICALS.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.530
WITHOUT THEM WE
GET A POOR HARVEST

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.730
BUT THE SPRAYS
ARE VERY EXPENSIVE.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.230
>>THE ARTIFICIAL FERTILIZERS
SIMPLY AREN'T AS EFFECTIVE

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.530
AS MOTHER NATURE AND
THEY'RE ALSO A BIG DRAIN

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.400
ON HIS PROFITS.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.130
IT'S A BLEAK SITUATION
AND MOHAMMED NO LONGER

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:13.660
SEES A FUTURE
HERE FOR HIS SONS.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:19.900
AS A DIRECT RESULT OF MODERN
DAMMING METHODS AGRICULTURE

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:24.160
IN EGYPT IS IN DECLINE FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN ITS HISTORY

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.960
AND FARMERS ARE BEING
FORCED OUT OF A WAY OF LIFE

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.930
THAT HAS SUPPORTED THIS NATION
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.000
AS THE RIVER JOURNEYS TOWARD
EGYPT'S SOUTHERNMOST BORDER

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.300
IT'S HARD TO AVOID THE SIGNS
AND SIGNALS THAT THIS IS FAST

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.860
BECOMING A VERY MODERN NATION
WITH TOURISM NOW REPLACING

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.060
FARMING AS THE MAINSTAY
OF THE EGYPTIAN ECONOMY,

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:59.030
AND WITH THE OLD WAYS GRADUALLY
DISAPPEARING INTO THE SAND.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.800
BUT NO MATTER HOW MUCH LIFE
CHANGES ALONG ITS BANKS,

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.430
THE NILE REMAINS AN ETERNAL
AND CONSTANT PRESENCE IN EGYPT.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:25.160
WHETHER PEOPLE PLOW THE LAND
OR RELAX IN LINEN SUITS ON THE

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.100
DECKS OF CRUISE SHIPS, THE RIVER
IS ALWAYS CLOSE AND EVER PRESENT

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:33.230
- THE STAR ATTRACTION FOR
LOCALS AND VISITORS ALIKE.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:48.430
IN ASWAN, HOWEVER, A CITY VERY
CLOSE TO EGYPT'S SOUTHERN

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:53.130
BORDER, THE RIVER IS UPSTAGED BY
A COLOSSUS WHICH TOOK TEN YEARS

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.900
TO COMPLETE AND USED UP
ENOUGH BUILDING MATERIALS

00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:04.030
TO HAVE CONSTRUCTED 17
GREAT PYRAMIDS AT GIZA...

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:10.560
THE ASWAN DAM.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:15.730
HAILED AS EGYPT'S SAVIOR
WHEN IT WAS COMPLETED IN 1970,

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:22.500
THE DAM PROVIDED THE COUNTRY
WITH 90% OF ITS ELECTRICITY.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.360
BUT PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT
REASON FOR BUILDING THIS DAM

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.260
HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH GENERATING POWER.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:39.100
EGYPT IS THE DRIEST
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:43.600
THE NILE, ALTHOUGH AN
ALMIGHTY RIVER, HAS SOMETIMES

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.360
REVEALED ITSELF AS AN
EXTREMELY VULNERABLE FORCE.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.330
IT IS ALMOST ENTIRELY
DEPENDENT ON UPSTREAM RAINS

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:57.360
TO FEED AND
RENEW ITS FLOW.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.600
AND IN THE PAST,
WHEN THESE FAILED,

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:09.300
THE NILE AND THE WHOLE
OF EGYPT ALSO FAILED.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:14.000
ONE OF THE WORST EVER DROUGHTS
HAPPENED DURING THE TIMES OF THE

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.630
PHARAOHS AND IS RECORDED ON THIS
STONE KNOWN AS THE FAMINE STELE.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.460
THESE HIEROGLYPHS TELL OF
A SEVEN YEAR LONG DROUGHT

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.100
WHEN THE RAINS DID NOT
COME AND WHEN THE NILE WAS

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.860
TURNED INTO A MUD BAKED
TRENCH AS IF DUG OUT

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:36.000
ESPECIALLY TO RECEIVE THE
DRY CORPSES OF THE NATION.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.960
BUT THE ASWAN DAM
CHANGED EVERYTHING.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.500
IT ALLOWED EGYPT TO STORE
VAST QUANTITIES OF NILE WATER

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.700
IN LAKE NASSER AND GAVE
THE COUNTRY DIRECT CONTROL

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:59.830
OVER ITS MOST
PRECIOUS RESOURCE.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:05.260
FOR OVER 30 YEARS THE DAM HAS
SUPPLIED EGYPT WITH ENOUGH

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:11.560
ELECTRICITY AND WATER TO SATISFY
THE NEEDS OF ALL ITS PEOPLE.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.560
DURING THE 1980'S WHEN ETHIOPIA
SUFFERED YEARS OF TERRIBLE

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.060
DROUGHT AND FAMINE, EGYPT WAS
ABLE TO BASK IN THE RESERVES

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:24.400
HELD IN LAKE NASSER...

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.630
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:34.130
WITH 63 MILLION INHABITANTS NOW
FILLING UP ALL THE AREAS ALONG

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:38.330
THE NILE AND WITH THE POPULATION
EXPLOSION SET TO CONTINUE,

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:42.100
THE ASWAN DAM MAY NOT
BE ENOUGH TO SAVE EGYPT

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:49.660
FROM DYING OF
THIRST IN THE FUTURE.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:54.560
THE SOLUTION TO THIS
SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION

00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:03.530
MAY BE FOUND IN THE
MOST UNLIKELY OF PLACES.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:07.630
THE TOSHKA PROJECT SEEKS TO
RELIEVE POPULATION CONGESTION

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:10.860
AND RECLAIM SOME 4,000
SQUARE KILOMETERS OF LAND

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:15.760
FOR AGRICULTURE BY
IRRIGATING THE DESERT.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:31.900
TRANSLATOR: I PUT WATER
INTO THE DESERT BECAUSE

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.030
I'M CERTAIN
OF SUCCESS.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.430
THE LAND WILL
BECOME FERTILE

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.030
AND PEOPLE WILL BE
ABLE TO LIVE HERE.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.600
THE PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS
PROJECT AS THEY TALKED ABOUT

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.760
THE PYRAMIDS, THE ASWAN
DAM, AND THE PHARAOHS.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.760
>>IRRIGATION SECRETARY, AHMED
MORSI, IS THE GOVERNMENT'S

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.860
REPRESENTATIVE
IN TOSHKA.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.630
HE BELIEVES THAT BY
DIVERTING WATER FROM THE NILE

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.060
AND PUMPING IT INTO THE
MIDDLE OF THE DESERT,

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:14.830
EGYPT'S FUTURE
WILL BE ASSURED.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:19.230
BUT TO TURN TOSHKA FROM DESERT
TO SETTLEMENT REQUIRES AN EXTRA

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:24.330
FIVE BILLION CUBIC LITERS OF
WATER EVERY YEAR - A SITUATION

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:32.100
WHICH HAS GREATLY ANGERED
THE OTHER AFRICAN NATIONS.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.760
THE NILE'S WATERS FLOW
THROUGH TEN COUNTRIES

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.630
BUT IT'S EGYPT WHICH HAS
ALWAYS BEEN ALLOWED

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:43.930
TO USE MOST OF IT,
A MASSIVE 65%,

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.800
LEAVING NEXT TO NOTHING
FOR THE OTHER NATIONS

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:52.400
TO SHARE
BETWEEN THEM.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.960
THE DISTRIBUTION AND OWNERSHIP
OF THE NILE HAS NOTHING TO DO

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.360
WITH THE AMOUNT OF WATER WHICH
FLOWS THROUGH EACH COUNTRY.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:07.200
IT IS IN FACT THE RESULT OF
AN OLD COLONIAL AGREEMENT.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.560
THE 1929 TREATY BETWEEN EGYPT
AND GREAT BRITAIN, WHOSE EMPIRE

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.300
AT THE TIME STRETCHED OVER A
GREAT SWATH OF THE NILE BASIN,

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.500
GAVE EGYPT THE POWER OF VETO TO
STOP ANY UPSTREAM DEVELOPMENTS

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:25.600
FROM AFFECTING THE AMOUNT
OF WATER REACHING ITS LANDS.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.930
IN RETURN FOR COTTON AND
AN EASY TRADE ROUTE TO INDIA,

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:34.500
THE BRITISH GAVE EGYPT
FULL CONTROL OF THE RIVER

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.230
AND A LION'S
SHARE OF ITS FLOW.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:44.630
THESE RIGHTS ARE
STILL MAINTAINED TODAY.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.360
WHILST OTHER NATIONS
ARE PREVENTED FROM

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.130
HARNESSING A SINGLE DROP
OF THE NILE, EGYPT IS NOW

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:53.800
DIVERTING EVEN MORE
OF THIS PRECIOUS RIVER

00:25:53.800 --> 00:26:00.900
TO GROW CROPS IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE DESERT.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:05.000
AHMED, HOWEVER, IS PROMISING
FAITHFULLY TO OFFSET THE USE OF

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.800
EXTRA WATER HERE BY LIMITING
CONSUMPTION ELSEWHERE IN EGYPT.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:18.900
TRANSLATOR: THE PROJECT HAS
NOT AND WILL NOT CAUSE ANY

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.530
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN US AND
THE OTHER NILE COUNTRIES.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.200
NONE OF THE RIGHTS OF
OTHER COUNTRIES ARE LOST

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:32.230
AND NEITHER DO WE TAKE
MORE THAN WE DESERVE.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:36.130
>>BUT CRITICS SAY THAT
EGYPT WILL SOON BE DEMANDING

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:43.360
AN EVEN GREATER SHARE OF THE
NILE THAN IT'S GETTING ALREADY.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.160
WITH THE OTHER NILE NATIONS
FED UP WITH TAKING A BACK SEAT

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.030
AND NOW CLAIMING
THEIR RIGHT TO THE RIVER,

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:57.060
WATER WARS COULD SOON BECOME
A VERY REAL AND POTENT DANGER

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:01.230
WITH ETHIOPIA A COUNTRY
ON THE FRONT LINE.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.560
FROM EGYPT THE NILE SNAKES BACK
THROUGH THE DESERTS OF THE SUDAN

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.760
BEFORE SPLITTING INTO
TWO SEPARATE STREAMS.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.930
FROM THIS POINT THE NILE BECOMES
TWO RIVERS: THE WHITE NILE WITH

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:40.660
ITS SOURCE IN UGANDA, AND
THE MORE POWERFUL BLUE NILE

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:45.560
WHICH NOW TAKES US TO THE
SOURCE OF OUR STORY - ETHIOPIA.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:10.000
THE ETHIOPIA WE EXPECT TO SEE IS
A PARCHED AND BARREN COUNTRY,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.100
RAVAGED BY DICTATORSHIP
AND CIVIL WAR

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:23.430
AND LEFT TO ROT
IN THE MIDDAY SUN.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:26.330
BUT THIS ISN'T THE
WHOLE PICTURE.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.630
ETHIOPIA IS AN INCREDIBLE
COUNTRY OF IMMENSE BEAUTY

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:32.030
WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF
ONE OF THE MOST PRECIOUS

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:36.730
NATURAL RESOURCES
IN THE WORLD...

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:39.000
WATER.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.030
THIS IS THE COUNTRY WHICH
PROVIDES EGYPT WITH 90%

00:28:56.030 --> 00:29:00.230
OF ITS WATER SUPPLY AND IS
THE SOURCE OF THE NILE ITSELF.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.600
BUT DESPITE ITS
APPARENT WATER WEALTH,

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.560
ETHIOPIA'S PROBLEM HAS
ALWAYS BEEN A CRIPPLING

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:11.930
INABILITY TO USE THE
VAST PERCENTAGE OF IT.

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:18.600
AS THE NILE FLOWS THROUGH A LUSH
BUT ALMOST IMPENETRABLE VALLEY

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.600
NAMED THE BLUE NILE GORGE,
IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.500
THIS IS A COUNTRY WITH A
VERY DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.960
TO THE ONE THAT EGYPT
HAS WITH THE RIVER.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.900
FAR FROM BEING EVER PRESENT AND
EVER CLOSE, THE NILE IN ETHIOPIA

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.300
IS OFTEN TRAPPED BY TERRAIN
MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:41.660
RIVER TO SEEP OUT AND IRRIGATE
THE SURROUNDING LANDS.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:45.400
IT SEEMS ALMOST TO BE
SWALLOWED UP BY THE LANDSCAPE,

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:51.660
CONSUMED BY
SOME DARK FORCE.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:56.600
SUPERSTITION HAS LONG HELD THAT
THE BLUE NILE GORGE WHICH

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.900
STRETCHES FOR 400 KILOMETERS
RIGHT THROUGH THE HEART OF

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:07.030
ETHIOPIA IS AN EVIL PLACE
POPULATED BY DANGEROUS SPIRITS.

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:09.900
THIS, ALONG WITH ITS
EXTREMELY HARSH GEOGRAPHY,

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.630
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SERIOUS
OBSTACLE, NOT ONLY IN

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:18.630
ACCESSING THE NILE BUT ALSO
IN THE SEARCH FOR ITS SOURCE.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:21.800
THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS
PROBABLY TRAVELED UPSTREAM

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:28.600
AS FAR AS THIS POINT BUT WEREN'T
ABLE TO PENETRATE ANY FURTHER.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:33.660
IT WAS ONLY IN 1968 THAT THE
GORGE WAS FINALLY NAVIGATED.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:37.830
AND TO THIS DAY RUMORS OF
DEATHLY RAPIDS, HUGE CROCODILES

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:46.960
AND RUTHLESS BANDITS
DETER WOULD-BE TRAVELERS.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.860
THE CRUEL PARADOX FOR
LOCALS IS THAT EVEN THOUGH

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.730
THIS IS THE COUNTRY
WHICH FEEDS THE NILE,

00:30:52.730 --> 00:31:00.200
ETHIOPIA HAS NEVER BEEN
ABLE TO USE IT TO FEED ITSELF.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.730
AS THIS JOURNEY TO THE
RIVER'S SOURCE CONTINUES

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.800
THROUGH TO THE FARMING
HEARTLAND OF ETHIOPIA,

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.860
IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO GRASP
WHY THIS FRUITFUL COUNTRY

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:18.000
SHOULD STILL BE DEPENDENT
ON FOOD AID FOR ITS SURVIVAL.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.600
BUT ENU TEMESGHEN
KNOWS ONLY TOO WELL

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.060
WHY THIS IS
STILL THE CASE.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.300
HE AND HIS WIFE, WOOBIT, OWN
A SMALL FARM JUST AT THE END

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:30.760
OF THE BLUE NILE GORGE IN
THE FOOTHILLS OF ETHIOPIA.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.300
AND EVEN THOUGH THE NILE
HERE FINALLY BREAKS FREE

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.060
OF ITS CONFINES TO FLOW
RIGHT THROUGH THEIR FIELDS,

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:40.900
ENU CAN HARDLY USE
A SINGLE DROP OF IT.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.600
TRANSLATOR: THE
NILE IS FAR FOR ME.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.460
I CANNOT AFFORD A MOTOR
PUMP AND I CANNOT FETCH IT

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:51.160
WITH MY BARE HANDS SO ONLY
MY CATTLE DRINK FROM IT.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.700
IF I COULD I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY
TO BRING THE NILE TO MY LAND

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:59.260
BUT IT IS BEYOND
OUR ABILITY.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:04.430
>>ENU USED TO BE A BUILDER'S
LABORER WITH NOTHING

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:08.230
TO HIS NAME, BUT HE WORKED
HARD AND SAVED UP HIS MEAGER

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:13.200
WAGES TO BUY A SMALL PLOT
OF LAND AND GET MARRIED.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.030
HIS FAMILY NOW WORK
TOGETHER ON THE FARM.

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:20.630
THE DAYS ARE LONG AND HARD, WITH
EACH ONE OF THEM CONTRIBUTING

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:25.730
NOT JUST TO THEIR LIVELIHOOD
BUT TO THEIR SURVIVAL.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:30.700
UNLIKE EGYPT, THERE ARE HARDLY
ANY IRRIGATION OR WATER STORAGE

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:34.760
SYSTEMS IN ETHIOPIA AND SO
FARMERS HERE ARE ENTIRELY

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:41.960
DEPENDENT ON THE ANNUAL RAINY
SEASON TO GROW THEIR CROPS.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.630
WHEN THERE'S RAIN THERE'S PLENTY
OF FOOD, BUT FOR NINE MONTHS

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:49.830
OF THE YEAR NOT A DROP
WILL FALL FROM THE SKIES.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:55.060
THEN THIS PLACE WILL BECOME
A DRY AND BARREN DUST BOWL.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.430
THE MOST FRUSTRATING
THING FOR ENU IS THAT

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:11.460
SINCE A LITTLE TRIBUTARY OF THE
NILE FLOWS THROUGH HIS LAND

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:16.330
HE COULD POTENTIALLY IRRIGATE
THEIR FIELDS ALL YEAR ROUND.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:20.630
BUT INSTEAD ALL THEY CAN DO IS
CARRY LITTLE QUANTITIES OF IT

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:24.730
IN PLASTIC
JERRY CANS.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.860
THIS IS WOOBIT'S JOB.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.600
SHE HAS TO MAKE THIS TRIP
FOUR OR FIVE TIMES A DAY

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:38.000
TO PROVIDE JUST ENOUGH WATER
TO COOK, CLEAN AND WASH.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.060
ENU'S DREAM IS TO SOME DAY BE
ABLE TO AFFORD A WATER PUMP

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:46.660
SO THAT WOOBIT WON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS BACKBREAKING WORK

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:52.230
AND SO THAT HE'LL BE ABLE TO
PROPERLY IRRIGATE THEIR FIELDS.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:57.960
TRANSLATOR: THEN OUR
COUNTRY WILL BE LIKE A FLOWER.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.830
HAND LABOR WILL BE
REPLACED BY MACHINES

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:06.460
AND WATER WILL BE
USED FOR DEVELOPMENT.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:10.130
IF THE NILE IS GIVEN
TO THE FARMER,

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:13.560
THE FARM LAND
WILL BE SO BIG.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:22.330
OH, IF I GET THAT, I
WILL BE A RICH MAN.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:25.430
>>ALL THIS
SHOULD BE POSSIBLE.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.460
THIS VAST COUNTRY HAS AN
ESTIMATED 37,000 SQUARE

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:40.330
KILOMETERS OF GOOD FARMLAND - AN
AREA LARGER THAN BELGIUM THAT

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:46.200
IF PROPERLY IRRIGATED COULD FEED
ALL ITS PEOPLE ALL YEAR ROUND.

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.260
TO DO SO, HOWEVER, WOULD
REDUCE THE RIVER'S FLOW TO EGYPT

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.330
DRAMATICALLY AND RESULT
IN ALMOST CERTAIN CONFLICT

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:59.230
BETWEEN THE
TWO NATIONS.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:03.730
IT'S A POLITICAL STALEMATE
AND IN THE MEANTIME

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:07.430
NOTHING IS BEING DONE TO
HELP THE STARVING PEOPLE

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:12.260
AND STRUGGLING
FARMERS OF ETHIOPIA.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.900
ENU AND HIS FAMILY JUST
HAVE TO MAKE THE MOST OF

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.930
THE SUMMER RAINS AND
HOPE FOR A BETTER FUTURE

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:22.360
WHEN ETHIOPIA WILL BE ABLE
TO REALIZE ITS POTENTIAL

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:26.160
AND BLOSSOM INTO A
FULLY DEVELOPED NATION.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.900
BUT FOR NOW THE
UNAVOIDABLE TRUTH

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.260
THAT THIS IS A COUNTRY STILL
STRUGGLING TO PROVIDE

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.160
ITS PEOPLE WITH THE BARE
ESSENTIALS TO SURVIVE

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:48.730
IS STILL AS GLARINGLY CLEAR
AS THE BRIGHT ETHIOPIAN SUN.

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:52.700
IN A PLACE WHERE HUMAN BEINGS
ARE SO ENTIRELY AT THE MERCY

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:56.500
OF NATURE AND ITS FORCES
ON GOOD SOIL AND GOOD RAINS,

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.660
WITH HUNGER AND THIRST
THEIR OLD COMPANIONS,

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.260
IT'S HARDLY SURPRISING
THAT SOME PEOPLE HERE

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:09.230
STILL CLING TO THE COMFORT
OF ANCIENT BELIEFS.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:14.830
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON THROUGHOUT
THIS COUNTRY, BUT ESPECIALLY IN

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:18.230
THE AREAS CLOSEST TO THE NILE,
TO FIND SMALL GROUPS OF PEOPLE

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:22.600
HUDDLED BY THE RIVER
QUIETLY CHANTING VERSES

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.860
AND THROWING
OFFERINGS INTO THE WATER.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:30.960
A PIECE OF BREAD, A CUP OF
COFFEE, OR SOMETIMES A LIVE

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:36.630
SACRIFICE TO GIVE THANKS OR
PERHAPS APPEASE THE GREAT RIVER.

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:48.530
THE WATOW TRIBE IS ONE OF
THE OLDEST IN AFRICA AND THEIR

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:52.300
WAY OF LIFE HAS NOT CHANGED
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.730
THEY LIVE ON ONE OF
THE NILE'S TRIBUTARIES

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.300
ONLY THIRTY KILOMETERS
AWAY FROM ITS SOURCE

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.760
AND STILL MAKE BOATS OUT
OF PAPYRUS REMINISCENT OF

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.760
THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN USED IN ANCIENT EGYPT.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:08.660
GEBRAI SEMITU IS ONE
OF THE TRIBES' ELDERS.

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:15.360
TRANSLATOR: IT IS KNOWN THAT
THE LIFE OF THE WATOW TRIBE

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.160
IS ON THE WATER.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.660
POVERTY IS A BIG PROBLEM
FOR US, MORE THAN EVER.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.060
THE FISH HARVEST
IS DISAPPEARING

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:27.300
AND PAPYRUS IS NOT
FOUND NEAR LIKE BEFORE.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.960
IT IS A DIFFICULT LIFE.

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:43.930
>>THESE PEOPLE ARE UTTERLY
DEPENDENT ON THE NILE

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:47.300
FOR EVERYTHING - THEIR
FOOD AND THEIR FAITH.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.230
APART FROM THE LITTLE MONEY
THEY MAKE BY SELLING BASKETS

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:53.460
IN THE LOCAL MARKET, THEY LIVE
A HAND TO MOUTH EXISTENCE

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:59.560
WITH NO LAND TO FARM
AND NO ANIMALS TO REAR.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:03.700
THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
RIVER IS ONE OF COMPLETE

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:07.600
RESPECT, BELIEVING THAT THE
NILE IS AN AWESOME FORCE

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.700
THERE TO SERVE THE
NEEDS OF ALL THE PEOPLE

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:14.560
BUT BELONGING
TO NONE.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.800
TRANSLATOR: THE NILE IS
THE EARTH'S RESOURCE.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.200
IT BELONGS
TO THE EARTH.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:24.460
AS IT GOES ON ITS TRAVELS ON
EARTH, IT BELONGS TO NO ONE.

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:34.030
>>ONCE IN A WHILE A SHEEP
IS BOUGHT TO BE SACRIFICED,

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:36.960
BUT TODAY A CHICKEN
SEEMS TO SUFFICE.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.600
THE ANIMAL'S BLOOD WILL
BE POURED INTO THE WATER

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:44.430
MAKING SURE THAT NOT A SINGLE
DROP TOUCHES THE EARTH.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:47.430
IF IT DID, THE NILE'S
WRATH WOULD BE INCURRED

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:50.200
AND THEN WHO KNOWS
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN?

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.600
TRANSLATOR: THE NILE
IS OUR CARETAKER

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.530
AND WE SACRIFICE
FOR IT.

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:05.330
IT SUPPORTS US.

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:08.130
WHEN WE WERE KIDS AND SWAM
IN IT, IT DID NOT HARM US.

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:11.160
THIS IS BECAUSE WE
SACRIFICE FOR IT.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:29.260
>>OVER RECENT YEARS VILLAGE
ELDERS SEEM WORRIED THAT THEIR

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:33.200
SACRIFICES AREN'T WORKING
AS WELL AS THEY USED TO.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:37.230
THE NILE AND ITS ENVIRONMENTS
ARE CHANGING, THEY SAY,

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:42.330
AND THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:47.060
AS THE SUN SETS ON THE WATOW
VILLAGE WE CAN BUT PONDER ON

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:53.700
GEBRAI'S WORDS, "THE NILE
BELONGS TO ALL AND YET TO NONE".

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:59.100
WISE WORDS THAT A WISE WORLD
WOULD CHOOSE TO HEAR.

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:19.930
FOR MORE THAN 6,700 KILOMETERS
THE NILE SNAKES THROUGH FORESTS,

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:23.560
SLASHES THROUGH GORGES, AND
FLOATS THROUGH DESERTS

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:29.730
OFFERING SOME OF THE MOST
GRACEFUL SIGHTS IN AFRICA.

00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:33.860
IT JOURNEYS PAST MONUMENTS AND
MOUNTAINS, THROUGH LUSH FIELDS

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:38.260
AND URBAN EXPANSE, BUT ITS
HOME IS HERE, IN LAKE TANA,

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:44.000
THE SOURCE
OF THE NILE.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.800
OVER SIXTY SMALL RIVERS RUN
INTO THIS VAST INLAND SEA,

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:57.160
BUT ONLY ONE FLOWS
OUT: THE BLUE NILE.

00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:01.760
IT'S HERE, HIDDEN IN ANCIENT
TEXTS, THAT WE WILL UNLOCK

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.800
THE SECRET WHY ETHIOPIA
HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:13.130
UNLEASH THE POWER
OF ITS RIVER.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:19.060
THE ETHIOPIAN, OR COPTIC,
CHURCH IS AMONG THE WORLD'S

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:22.300
OLDEST CHRISTIAN
DENOMINATIONS.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.630
CHRISTIANITY HERE GOES
BACK TO THE FOURTH CENTURY

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:27.630
WITH THE ARC OF THE
COVENANT SAID TO BE HIDDEN

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:29.760
SOMEWHERE IN
THESE MOUNTAINS.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.600
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SITES
IS LAKE TANA ITSELF, WITH MANY

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:42.060
ANCIENT MONASTERIES
FOUNDED ON TANA'S 37 ISLANDS.

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:46.800
ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED
AND REVERED IS KEBRAN GABRIEL

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:50.130
WHICH STILL HOUSES A
SMALL COMMUNITY OF MONKS,

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:53.500
ALL OF WHOM ARE ENTIRELY
DEPENDENT ON THE LAKE

00:41:53.500 --> 00:42:01.160
AND THE NILE FOR THEIR
SPIRITUAL AND DAILY NEEDS.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:06.660
TRANSLATOR: LAKE
TANA IS IMPORTANT

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:09.100
BECAUSE OF THE
MONASTERIES,

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:12.500
BUT MORE SO BECAUSE THE NILE
FLOWS RIGHT THROUGH IT.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.160
IT'S A PLACE THAT'S
MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:22.430
AND IS ONE OF OUR MOST
PRECIOUS RESOURCES.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:33.460
>>ABAHI LI'MARYAM HAS LIVED HERE
FOR TEN YEARS SINCE HE WAS 15.

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:36.930
ETHIOPIA IS ONE OF THE MOST
DEVOUT AND CHRISTIAN COUNTRIES

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:39.130
IN THE WORLD.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:41.500
RELIGION IS EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT HERE,

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:45.730
WITH POLITICS AND FAITH
ALWAYS CLOSELY INTERTWINED.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:49.130
ETHIOPIA'S SPIRITUAL MAKEUP HAS
BEEN ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:55.000
THE COUNTRY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE
TO UTILIZE THE SACRED NILE.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:01.360
TO UNDERSTAND MORE WE HAVE
TO FOLLOW ABA MARYAM INTO

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:04.700
THE MONASTERY'S OLD
SCRIPTORIUM WHERE THEY KEEP

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:09.300
PRICELESS RELIGIOUS
ARTIFACTS AND ANCIENT TEXTS.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:12.300
TRANSLATOR: LOOK, THIS IS
WHERE IT EXPLAINS ABOUT EGYPT.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:15.000
THIS BOOK WAS MADE OF
PARCHMENT AND IT WAS WRITTEN

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.330
A VERY, VERY
LONG TIME AGO.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:24.700
>>IN THIS BOOK FROM
THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:28.700
THERE'S A NOTE REFERRING
TO AN ABU, OR ARCHBISHOP,

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:31.860
BEING SENT FROM
EGYPT TO ETHIOPIA.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:37.560
IT'S THIS LINE THAT
HOLDS THE KEY.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:43.430
IN THE CRUCIAL AREA OF RELIGION,
ETHIOPIA WAS FOR CENTURIES

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:47.060
UNDER THE RULE OF
THE EGYPTIAN CHURCH.

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:50.830
EVEN THEIR ARCHBISHOP,
THEIR ABU, WAS SENT TO THEM

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:54.700
FROM EGYPTIAN HQ.

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.830
WITH THAT KIND OF DEPENDANCY
ON EGYPT FOR THEIR SPIRITUAL

00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:01.600
HEALTH, ETHIOPIA WAS ALWAYS
KEPT UNDER THEIR YOKE,

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:05.130
AFRAID THAT IF THEY EVER DARED
INTERFERE WITH EGYPT'S LIFELINE

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.760
THEN THEY WOULD
LOSE THEIR ARCHBISHOP

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.560
AND THEIR OWN
RELIGIOUS HEARTBEAT.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:18.360
BUT THEN IN 1959, IN AN ACT
WHICH EXPRESSED A GROWING

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:22.060
NATIONAL SELF CONFIDENCE,
THE ETHIOPIANS BROKE AWAY

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.760
FROM THE
EGYPTIAN CHURCH.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:28.530
BY SO DOING THEY RELEASED
THEMSELVES OF ANY SPIRITUAL

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:31.460
DEPENDENCY AND SET THE
STAGE FOR WHAT COULD BE

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:35.460
A CONFLICT OF
APOCALYPTIC PROPORTIONS.

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:49.360
TRANSLATOR: IT'S
A GIFT OF GOD.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:54.230
IF IT WERE A GIFT OF MAN IT
WOULD HAVE DRIED UP BY NOW,

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:57.500
BUT IT WILL
ALWAYS BE THERE.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:02.860
WE'LL USE IT
ALL OUR LIVES.

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:15.960
>>WITH HARDLY ANY CONTACT
WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.000
ABA MARYAM AND HIS SMALL
COMMUNITY ON LAKE TANA

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.730
SEEM UNAWARE THAT
THE FUTURE OF THE NILE

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:24.760
MAY NOW HANG
IN THE BALANCE.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.500
200 KILOMETERS FROM LAKE
TANA, ON ONE OF THE MAIN

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:42.060
DISTRIBUTARIES OF THE NILE,
LOOMS A HUGE CONCRETE

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:51.130
STRUCTURE WHICH COULD
CHANGE THE NILE BASIN FOREVER.

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:55.330
WHEN COMPLETED,
THE TEKEZE DAM WILL BE

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:59.900
ONE OF THE
LARGEST IN AFRICA.

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:02.960
ALTHOUGH THE PLAN AT
THE MOMENT IS TO USE IT TO

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.860
GENERATE HYDRO ELECTRICITY,
IT HAS THE POTENTIAL

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:09.500
TO RETAIN A VAST AMOUNT
OF WATER FOR IRRIGATION,

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:15.560
BLOCKING MUCH OF
ITS FLOW TO EGYPT.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.360
IF THE TEKEZE
SCHEME IS SUCCESSFUL,

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:22.360
ETHIOPIA PLANS TO BUILD
MANY MORE DAMS JUST LIKE IT

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:26.230
AND IF THIS HAPPENS SOME
EXPERTS SAY THAT EGYPT'S

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:31.130
WATER SUPPLY COULD BE
REDUCED BY 40% OR MORE.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:44.960
TRANSLATOR: THE ETHIOPIAN
GOVERNMENT'S FIRST GOAL

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:49.230
IS TO CHANGE THE LIFE OF
THE POOR - GIVE THEM POWER,

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:52.960
BUILD DAMS TO
PROVIDE DRINKING WATER.

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.900
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO
HAVE TO WALK SIX TO SEVEN HOURS

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.600
TO FETCH WATER.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:06.960
THE PRIORITY HERE
IS OUR PEOPLE.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:12.830
>>ASFOUR SHIGRA IS THE
ETHIOPIAN SITE MANAGER

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:16.630
THAT HAS BEEN WORKING ON
THIS PROJECT FOR SIX YEARS.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:19.260
HE HARDLY EVER
SEES HIS FAMILY

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:22.300
WHO LIVE IN THE
CAPITAL, ADDIS ABABA.

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:28.060
BUT ALL THE EFFORT AND SACRIFICE
HE SAYS WILL BE WORTH IT.

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:31.930
HIS CHILDREN WERE VERY YOUNG
DURING THE FAMINE OF THE 80'S

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:34.500
AND HE SAYS THAT HE NEVER
WANTS TO LIVE THROUGH

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:40.960
A PERIOD LIKE
THAT AGAIN.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:46.860
TRANSLATOR: ETHIOPIA IN THE
PAST HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:51.000
AT FIRST, OUR PROBLEM WAS
THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO USE

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.460
OUR NATURAL RESOURCES
- ESPECIALLY UNABLE

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.230
TO USE THE CHEAP
RESOURCES, THE RIVERS.

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:59.460
HENCE THERE WAS BIG
FAMINE IN OUR COUNTRY.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:07.600
NOW IS THE TIME TO
ERADICATE THAT FAMINE.

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:11.130
>>THE TAKEZE PROJECT WAS ON THE
DRAWING BOARD FOR MANY YEARS

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:13.500
BUT POTENTIAL
WESTERN INVESTORS

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.830
SUCH AS THE WORLD BANK
WERE ALWAYS SCARED OFF

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:20.030
BY BELLIGERENT NOISES
FROM THE EGYPTIAN CAPITAL.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:22.830
SO ETHIOPIA WENT EAST
IN SEARCH OF HELP AND

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:29.460
IN 2002 FOUND A CHINESE
BACKER FOR THIS PROJECT.

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:34.830
THE TAKEZE MARKS A DEFINITE
TURNING POINT IN ETHIOPIA'S

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:39.430
HISTORY AND IN ITS POTENTIAL
TO HARNESS THE NILE.

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:44.530
IT ALSO MARKS THE REALIZATION
OF MANY OF EGYPT'S FEARS.

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:49.030
AFTER THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF
JUST LETTING IT SLIP THROUGH

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:52.900
THEIR FINGERS, ETHIOPIA'S
NEW DETERMINATION AND ABILITY

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:56.000
TO UTILIZE THE BLUE
NILE IS LIKELY TO PUT IT

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.160
ON A COLLISION COURSE
WITH EGYPT, THE COUNTRY

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:07.330
WHICH MAKES MOST USE OF
THE WATER DOWNSTREAM.

00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:12.360
CONFLICT HAS BEEN THREATENED
BY BOTH SIDES BUT ASFOUR

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:17.060
BELIEVES THAT ALL THIS
DOESN'T HAVE TO LEAD TO WAR.

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:23.960
TRANSLATOR: WHEN WE TAKE SUCH
MEASURES TO FEED OUR PEOPLE,

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.830
EGYPT, OUR NEIGHBOR
AND BROTHER,

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:29.930
SHOULD NOT BE NERVOUS
AND SHOULD NEVER BE.

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:33.100
BEFORE THERE WAS NOT MUCH
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US.

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:41.900
NOW WE KNOW EACH
OTHER VERY WELL.

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:44.030
>>FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN HISTORY

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:47.860
ALL TEN NILE BASIN STATES ARE
MEETING AROUND ONE TABLE

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:51.560
TO DISCUSS HOW BEST
TO SHARE THE RIVER.

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:55.700
DESPITE ASFOUR'S OPTIMISM,
RELATIONS ARE STILL TENSE

00:49:55.700 --> 00:50:00.300
AND AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
COUNTRIES IS A LONG WAY OFF.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:05.000
THERE IS HOPE, HOWEVER,
WITH ETHIOPIA AND EGYPT

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
NOW STARTING TO WORK
TOGETHER TO FACE REALITIES

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:15.060
AND FIND A SOLUTION TO
THEIR CONFLICTING DEMANDS.

00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:19.700
ONE THING IS CERTAIN, TO AVERT
DISASTER THERE WILL HAVE TO BE

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:22.700
COMPROMISE
ON BOTH SIDES.

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:27.100
WAR CAN ONLY BE AVOIDED IF EVERY
COUNTRY BEGINS TO SEE THE RIVER

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:32.160
AS A GIFT FOR ALL
BUT A PRIZE FOR NONE.

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:43.060
THE NILE, MORE THAN ANY
OTHER RIVER IN THE WORLD,

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:48.260
EVOKES A FEELING OF CONTINUUM,
AN EVERLASTING PRESENCE.

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:53.330
FROM ARISTOTLE AND MOSES
THROUGH TO PRESENT DAY POLITICS

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:56.800
THE NILE FLOWS THROUGH
THE WORLD'S CONSCIOUSNESS

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.260
AND ITS HISTORY.

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:05.260
NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE SURE
IT FLOWS THROUGH ITS FUTURE.
