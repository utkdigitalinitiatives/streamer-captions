00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800


2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.800
If I have too austerelypunish'd you,

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.530
Your compensation makesamends, for I

4
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.630
Have given you here athird of my own life,

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.330
Or that for which I live;

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.100
who once again I tender tothy hands: all thy vexations

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.770
Were but my trials of thylove and thou haststrangely stood the test.

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:36.770
Here afore Heaven, Iratify this my rich gift.

9
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.900
O Ferdinand,

10
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.870
Do not smile at me that Iboast here of,

11
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.630
For thou shalt find shewill outstrip all praise

12
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.530
And make it halt behindher.

13
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.830
I do believe it against anoracle.

14
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.130
Then, as my gift and thineown acquisition

15
00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:00.500
Worthily purchased, takemy daughter.

16
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.070
But if thou dost break hervirgin-knot before

17
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.730
All sanctimoniousceremonies may

18
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.000
With full and holy rite beminister'd,

19
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.570
No sweet aspersion shallthe heavens let fall

20
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.430
To make this contractgrow: but barren hate,

21
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.500
Sour-eyed disdain anddiscord shall bestrew

22
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.230
The union of your bed withweeds so loathly

23
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.700
That you shall hate itboth: therefore take heed,

24
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.300
As Hymen's lamps shalllight you.

25
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.170
As I hope

26
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.200
For quiet days, fair issueand long life,

27
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.330
With such love as 'tisnow, the murkiest den,

28
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.000
The most opportune place,the strong'st suggestion,

29
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.500
Our worser genius can,shall never melt

30
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.330
Mine honour into lust, totake away

31
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.430
The edge of that day'scelebration

32
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.370
When I shall think: orPhoebus' steeds are founder'd,

33
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.930
Or Night kept chain'dbelow.

34
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.800
Fairly spoke.

35
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.070
Sit then.

36
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.870
And talk with her;

37
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.630
she is thine own.

38
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.800
What, Ariel.

39
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.300
My industrious servant,Ariel.

40
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.130
What would my potentmaster? Here I am.

41
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.270
Thou and thy meanerfellows your last service

42
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.200
Did worthily perform; butI must use you

43
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.300
In such another trick.

44
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.400
Go bring the rabble,

45
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.600
O'er whom I give theepower, here to this place:

46
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.430
Incite them to quickmotion; for I must

47
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.300
Bestow upon the eyes ofthis young couple

48
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.700
Some vanity of mine art:it is my promise,

49
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.030
And they expect it fromme.

50
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.530
-Presently? -Ay, with atwink.

51
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.200
Before you can say "come"and "go,"

52
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.970
And breathe twice and cry"so, so,"

53
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.800
Each one, tripping on histoe,

54
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.530
Will be here with mop andmow.

55
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.030
Do you love me, master?

56
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.570
No?

57
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.700
Dearly my delicate Ariel.

58
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.830
Do not approach

59
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.470
Till thou dost hear mecall.

60
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.430
Well, I conceive.

61
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.170
Look thou be true; do notgive dalliance

62
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.430
Too much the rein: thestrongest oaths are straw

63
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.000
To the fire i' the blood:be more abstemious,

64
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.430
Or else, good night yourvow.

65
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.630
I warrant you sir;

66
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.500
The white cold virgin snowupon my heart

67
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.300
Abates the ardour of myliver.

68
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.500
Well.

69
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.770
Now come, my Ariel, bringa corollary,

70
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.370
Rather than want a spirit:appear and pertly.

71
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.530
No tongue.

72
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.830
All eyes.

73
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.600
Be silent.

74
00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:02.970
Honour, riches,

75
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.530
marriage-blessing,

76
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:18.830
Long continuance, andincreasing,

77
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.970
Hourly joys

78
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.430
be still upon you!

79
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.930
Juno sings her blessingson you.

80
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:45.970
Juno sings her blessingson you.

81
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.800
Earth's increase, foisonplenty,

82
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.370
Barns and garners neverempty,

83
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.200
Vines with clusteringbunches growing,

84
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.500
Plants with goodly burdenbowing;

85
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.530
Spring come to you at thefarthest

86
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.030
In the very end ofharvest.

87
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.300
Scarcity and want shallshun you;

88
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.500
Ceres' blessing so is onyou.

89
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:40.130
Ceres' blessing so is onyou.

90
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.530
This is a most majesticvision, and

91
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.770
Harmonious charmingly.

92
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.130
May I be bold

93
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.870
To think these spirits?

94
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.730
Spirits, which by mine art

95
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.330
I have from their confinescall'd to enact

96
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.970
My present fancies.

97
00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.830
Let me live here ever;

98
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.300
So rare a wonder'd fatherand a wise

99
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.600
Makes this place Paradise.

100
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.800
Sweet, now, silence.

101
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.600
Juno and Ceres whisperseriously;

102
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.830
There's something else todo: hush, and be mute,

103
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.030
Or else our spell ismarr'd.

104
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:25.330
You nymphs, call'd Naiads,of the windring brooks,

105
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:34.770
With your sedged crownsand ever-harmless looks,

106
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:40.830
Leave your crisp channelsand on this green land

107
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:52.200
Answer your summons; Junodoes command:

108
00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:02.530
Come, temperate nymphs,and help to celebrate

109
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:11.700
A contract of true love;be not too late.

110
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:20.070
You sunburnt sicklemen, ofAugust weary,

111
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:27.700
Come hither from thefurrow and be merry:

112
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:34.270
Make holiday; yourrye-straw hats put on

113
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:43.430
And these fresh nymphsencounter every one

114
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:49.130
In country footing.

115
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.770
I had forgot that foulconspiracy

116
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.730
Of the beast Caliban andhis confederates

117
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.700
Against my life: theminute of their plot

118
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.800
Is almost come.

119
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.900
Well done!

120
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.700
Avoid; no more!

121
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.130
This is strange: yourfather's in some passion

122
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.470
That works him strongly.

123
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.630
Never till this day

124
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.700
Saw I him touch'd withanger so distemper'd.

125
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.230
You do look, my son, in amoved sort,

126
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.200
As if you were dismay'd:be cheerful, sir.

127
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.300
Our revels now are ended.

128
00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.430
These our actors,

129
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.270
As I foretold you, wereall spirits and

130
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:04.730
Are melted into air, intothin air:

131
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.900
And, like the baselessfabric of this vision,

132
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.330
The cloud-capp'd towers,the gorgeous palaces,

133
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.700
The solemn temples, thegreat globe itself,

134
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.170
Yea all which it inherit,shall dissolve

135
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.700
And, like this insubstantialpageant faded,

136
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.930
Leave not a rack behind.

137
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.570
We are such stuff

138
00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:36.330
As dreams are made on, andour little life

139
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.570
Is rounded with a sleep.

140
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.400
Sir, I am vex'd;

141
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.830
Bear with my weakness; myold brain is troubled:

142
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.670
Be not disturb'd by myinfirmity:

143
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.430
If you be pleased, retireinto my cell

144
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.370
And there repose: a turnor two I'll walk,

145
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.670
To still my beating mind.

146
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.830
We wish your peace.

147
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.970
Come with a thought Ithank thee, Ariel: come.

148
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.170
Thy thoughts I cleave to.

149
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.370
What's thy pleasure?

150
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.500
Spirit, we must prepare tomeet with Caliban.

151
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.530
Ay, my commander: when Ipresented Ceres,

152
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.600
I thought to have toldthee of it, but I fear'd

153
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.800
Lest I might anger thee.

154
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.100
Say again, where didstthou leave these varlets?

155
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.770
I told you, sir, they werered-hot with drinking;

156
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.430
So full of valour thatthey smote the air

157
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.830
For breathing of theirfaces; beat the ground

158
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.800
For kissing of their feet;yet always bending

159
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.530
Towards their project.

160
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.330
Then I beat my tabour;

161
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.600
At which, like unback'd colts,they prick'd their ears,

162
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.400
Advanced their eyelids,lifted up their noses

163
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.170
As they smelt music: so Icharm'd their ears

164
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.830
That calf-like they mylowing follow'd through

165
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.930
Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes,pricking goss and thorns,

166
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.430
Which entered their frailshins: at last I left them

167
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.100
I' the filthy-mantled poolbeyond your cell,

168
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.170
There dancing up to thechins, that the foul lake

169
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.100
O'erstunk their feet.

170
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.470
This was well done, mybird.

171
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.200
Thy shape invisible retainthou still:

172
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.830
The trumpery in my house,go bring it hither,

173
00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.630
For stale to catch thesethieves.

174
00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.330
I go, I go.

175
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:05.870
A devil, a born devil, onwhose nature

176
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:10.330
Nurture can never stick;on whom my pains,

177
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.130
Humanely taken, all, alllost, quite lost;

178
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.800
And as with age his bodyuglier grows,

179
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.330
So his mind cankers.

180
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.230
I will plague them all,

181
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.330
Even to roaring.

182
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.900
Hang them upon this line.

183
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.430
Pray you, tread softly,that the blind mole may not

184
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.630
Hear a foot fall: we noware near his cell.

185
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.370
Monster, your fairy,

186
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:43.500
which you say is aharmless fairy,

187
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.930
hath done little better thanplayed the Jack with us.

188
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.670
Monster, I do smell allhorse-piss;

189
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.170
at which my nose is ingreat indignation.

190
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.370
So is mine.

191
00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.700
Do you hear, monster?

192
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.270
If I should take adispleasure against you,look you--

193
00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.130
Thou wert but a lostmonster.

194
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:02.130
Good my lord, give me thyfavour still.

195
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.070
Be patient, for the prizeI'll bring thee to

196
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:09.230
Shall hoodwink this mischance:therefore speak softly.

197
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.700
All's hush'd as midnightyet.

198
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.330
Ay, but to lose ourbottles in the pool.

199
00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.300
There is not only disgrace anddishonour in that, monster,

200
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.430
but an infinite loss.

201
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.300
That's more to me than mywetting:

202
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.300
yet this is your harmlessfairy, monster.

203
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.770
I will fetch off mybottle,

204
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:28.070
though I be o'er ears formy labour.

205
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.930
Prithee, my king, bequiet.

206
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.300
Seest thou here,

207
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:37.800
This is the mouth o' thecell: no noise, and enter.

208
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.900
Do that good mischiefwhich may make this island

209
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.900
Thine own for ever, and I,thy Caliban,

210
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.830
For aye thy foot-licker.

211
00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.570
Give me thy hand.

212
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.070
I do begin to have bloodythoughts.

213
00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.770
O king Stephano!

214
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.000
O peer!

215
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.570
O worthy Stephano!

216
00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.670
Look what a wardrobe hereis for thee!

217
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.270
Let it alone, thou fool;it is but trash.

218
00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.500
Monster!

219
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.370
We know what belongs to afrippery.

220
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.500
O king Stephano!

221
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.430
Put off that gown,Trinculo;

222
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.400
by this hand, I'll havethat gown.

223
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.830
Thy grace shall have it.

224
00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:15.900
The dropsy drown thisfool; what do you mean

225
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.430
To dote thus on suchluggage?

226
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.600
Let alone

227
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.870
And do the murder first:if he awake,

228
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:24.130
From toe to crown he'll fillour skins with pinches,

229
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.900
Make us strange stuff.

230
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.400
Be you quiet, monster.

231
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.330
Mistress line, is not thismy jerkin?

232
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.900
Now is the jerkin underthe line:

233
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.170
now, jerkin, you are liketo lose your hair

234
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.700
and prove a bald jerkin.

235
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:47.570
Do, do: we steal by lineand level,

236
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.030
an't like your grace.

237
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.030
I thank thee for that jest;here's a garment for't:

238
00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.830
wit shall not gounrewarded while I am kingof this country.

239
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:06.770
"Steal by line and level" isan excellent pass of pate;

240
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.370
there's another garmentfor't.

241
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.900
Monster, come, put somelime upon your fingers,

242
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.670
and away with the rest.

243
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.530
I will have none on't: weshall lose our time,

244
00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:22.400
And all be turn'd tobarnacles, or to apes

245
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.400
With foreheads villanouslow.

246
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.530
Monster, lay-to yourfingers:

247
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:30.470
help to bear this away wheremy hogshead of wine is,

248
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.930
or I'll turn you out of mykingdom:

249
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.870
go to, carry this.

250
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.070
And this.

251
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.900
Ay, and this.

252
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.430
Hey, Mountain, hey!

253
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.670
Silver, there it goes,Silver!

254
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.200
Fury, Fury!

255
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.230
There, Tyrant!

256
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.230
Go charge my goblins thatthey grind their joints

257
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.800
With dry convulsions,shorten up their sinews

258
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.600
With aged cramps, and morepinch-spotted make them

259
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.500
Than pard or cat o'mountain.

260
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.700
Hark, they roar.

261
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.300
Let them be huntedsoundly.

262
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.630
At this hour

263
00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:30.600
Lies at my mercy all mineenemies:

264
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.500
Shortly shall all mylabours end, and thou

265
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.470
Shalt have the air atfreedom: for a little

266
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:36.930
Follow, and do me service.

267
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.100
Now does my project gatherto a head:

268
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.100
