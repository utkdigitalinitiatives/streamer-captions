SPIRITUAL BELIEF.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.900
IS IT BEYOND UNDERSTANDING?

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.430
I JUST KNOW THAT IT MAKES A

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.100
DIFFERENCE.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.100
I DON'T NEED A BRAIN SCAN TO

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.830
TELL ME THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.200
HEALTHIER.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.330
IF WE HAVE TO DRAW

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.230
CONCLUSIONS NOW BASED UPON THE

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.300
DATA, THE ANSWER WOULD BE BEYOND

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.930
THE FACT THAT THERE IS NONE.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.000
SCIENCE IS NOT WIRED TO PICK

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.400
UP ANY SIGNALS.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.460
ARE SCIENCE AND FAITH

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.030
INCOMPATIBLE?

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.760
SCIENCE IS TAKING ME TO

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.860
SPIRITUALITY.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.800
IT IS ACTUALLY BRINGING ME

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.100
THERE.

THE INTERSECTION OF GOD AND

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.360
SCIENCE IS OFTEN A TREACHEROUS

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.130
PLACE.

EVOLUTION.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.860
BUT SOME SCIENTISTS WHO STUDY

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.660
THE HUMAN BRAIN ARE DETERMINED

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.030
TO DISCOVER IF RELIGIOUS

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.600
EXPERIENCE CAN BE OBSERVED OR

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.130
MEASURED.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.660
THEY ARE ASKING IF THE BRAIN IS

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.460
WIRED FOR GOD.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.100
THEIR EXPERIMENTS INVOLVE TAKING

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.360
IMAGES OF THE BRAIN FROM THOSE

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.430
WHO ARE DEEP IN PRAYER OR

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.860
MEDITATION.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.230
THE IDEA IS TO FIND OUT WHICH

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.100
BRAIN CIRCUITS OPEN AND CLOSE

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.060
DURING THOSE MOMENTS AND THEN

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.060
TO ASK, "IS THERE A PHYSICAL

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.330
PATTERN TO PRAYER?"

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.460
OTHER SCIENTISTS ATTEMPT

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.630
TO INDUCE A SENSE

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.460
OF SPIRITUALITY BY STIMULATING

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.400
THE BRAIN, AND SOME RESEARCH

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.460
EVEN EXAMINES THE CONCEPT

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.960
SO CENTRAL TO ALL RELIGIONS --

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.130
LIFE AFTER DEATH.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.160
WHETHER SCIENTISTS SHOULD EVEN

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.360
STUDY THESE THINGS IS

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.000
THE SUBJECT OF RAGING DEBATE.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.100
MANY RELIGIONS STIPULATE THAT

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.400
MATTERS OF FAITH ARE A MYSTERY

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.660
BEYOND THE REALM OF HUMAN

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.960
UNDERSTANDING.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.100
AND THEN THERE IS THE CHICKEN

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.460
AND EGG QUESTION --

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.860
IF, INDEED, SCIENTISTS COULD

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.900
PROVE THE HUMAN BRAIN IS WIRED

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.400
FOR RELIGION, THEN WHO --

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.600
OR WHAT -- WIRED IT THAT WAY?

REACTS DURING SPIRITUAL

SO SURE.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.530
NOT VERY INTENSE.

LOCALLY WHERE PEOPLE, A YOUNG

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.730
GIRL FELT A GOD TAKE

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.460
OVER HER BODY, SHE FELT

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.330
HER UTERUS STIMULATED, SHE FELT

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.000
A SEXUAL STIMULATION.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.060
SHE FELT AS IF THERE WAS A CHILD

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.200
ON HER LEFT SIDE.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.100
IT WAS HER EXPERIENCE

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.430
IN A CONTEXT OF A RELIGIOUS

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.900

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.960
CONCERNED, BUT IT WAS BEING

TRIGGERED.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.700

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.260
VERY SIMILAR TO THE PATTERN

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.000
BECAUSE THE CLOCK WAS NOT

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.160

WITH OUR SIMPLE TECHNOLOGY, MORE

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.030

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.100
GENERATE SENSED PRESENCES

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.460
RE-CREATE THE SPIRITUAL

THE EXISTENCE OF GOD?

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.760
WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY IS NOT

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.100
INTENDED TO OFFEND ANYONE,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.160

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.400
OF US ARE BEING CONTROLLED RIGHT

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.260
NOW BY NONPHYSICAL, INVISIBLE

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.730
PINK ELEPHANTS.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:19.860
NOW, YOU MAY NOT LIKE THAT IDEA,

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.460
BUT PROVE THEY'RE NOT THERE.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.630
THE POINT IS YOU CAN'T

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.400
BECAUSE THEY'RE NONPHYSICAL

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.030
AND INVISIBLE, AND SO MANY KINDS

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.100
OF WORDS, IN ALL CULTURES, THERE

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.600
ARE CERTAIN PHRASES, CERTAIN

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.560
BELIEFS THAT ARE NONTESTABLE

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.460
BECAUSE THEY NEVER CAN BE.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.930
BUT IF WE HAVE TO DRAW

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.630
CONCLUSIONS NOW, BASED

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.730
UPON THE DATA, THE ANSWER WOULD

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.260
BE MORE ON THE FACT THAT THERE

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.660
IS NO DEITY.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.700
Reporter: WHY DOESN'T THAT

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.700
JUST PROVE ON ITS FACE THAT

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.760
THESE ARE BIOCHEMICAL,

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.660
NEUROLOGICAL REACTIONS,

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.600
AS OPPOSED TO THE PRESENCE

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.900
OF GOD?

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.960
RELIGION IS MUCH, MUCH MORE

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.630
THAN CERTAIN STATES OF MIND,

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.100
CERTAIN ECSTATIC FEELINGS,

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.960
CERTAIN MEDITATIVE MOMENTS

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.230
OF PIETY OR OF LONGING OR SENSE

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.400
OF BELONGING TO THE ONENESS

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.960
OF BEING.

PROFESSOR OF THEOLOGY

AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.560
THERE'S A METHODOLOGICAL

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.000
RESTRAINT THAT FORBIDS SCIENCE

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.430
FROM EVER CROSSING

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:19.830
OVER INTO MAKING STATEMENTS THAT

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.200
WE HAVE FINALLY ENCOMPASSED

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.730
THE TOTALITY OF OUR BEING

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.400
BY OUR METHOD OF SCIENCE, WHEN

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.730
THE SCIENTIST HAS SAID THAT

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.130
THE SCIENTIST IS NO LONGER

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.300
A SCIENTIST BUT A BELIEVER.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.300
IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE,

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.460
THAT'S FINE.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.630
BELIEF CAN BE DANGEROUS.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.700
THERE IS NO WAY TO TEST IT ONE

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.660
WAY OR T OTHER.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.900
THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD, YOU CAN

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.230
TEST IT, AND IF WE CAN GENERATE

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.600
THE GOD EXPERIENCE, AND ALTER

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.130
THE GOD BELIEF EXPERIMENTALLY,

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.560
THAT MEANS WE HAVE A TOOL

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.730
BY WHICH WE CAN TRULY UNDERSTAND

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:47.960
WHAT THE BRAIN'S DOING.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.330
WHO CREATED IT, IF INDEED IT WAS

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:54.360
CREATED, BECOMES IRRELEVANT.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.260
PEOPLE HAVE LONG BELIEVED

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.600
IN THE POWER OF PRAYER

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.130
OR THE PEACE OF MEDITATION,

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.130
BUT THE BRAIN AND THE BODY

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.230
REALLY DO CHANGE DURING

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.860
SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.900

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.230
MY MIND MAY BE ONE

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.400

COME TO MEDITATE.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.460
THERE'S A KIND OF DEEPER REST

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.730
THAT BEGINS TO CONNECT

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:50.630
WITH THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF ME.

OF PENNSYLVANIA MEDICAL CENTER.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.800
IT WAS AS IF THE BOUNDARY

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.860
I PUT BETWEEN MYSELF

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.400
AND THE WORLD OUT THERE,

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.030
THE KIND OF SEPARATION BETWEEN

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.800
ME AND EVERYTHING ELSE BEGINS

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.430
TO SOFTEN AND LOOSEN.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.160

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.360
A SUBJECT FOR THE RESEARCH

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.730
CONDUCTED BY UNIVERSITY

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.030
OF PENNSYLVANIA NEURORADIOLOGIST

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.260
ANDREW NEWBERG.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.960
WHEN PEOPLE HAVE VERY

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.000
POWERFUL SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.130
THEY PERCEIVE THEM AS BEING

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.160
INCREDIBLY REAL.

Reporter: NEWBERG

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.100
DEMONSTRATED FOR US LAST AUGUST

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.330
HOW BAIME'S BRAIN, AS WELL

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.560
AS THE BRAINS OF OTHER TIBETAN

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.260
BUDDHISTS AND CATHOLIC NUNS,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.930
WERE PHOTOGRAPHED

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.730
DURING MEDITATION OR PRAYER.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.730
UNLIKE MICHAEL PERSINGER,

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.230
NEWBERG ISN'T TRYING TO PROVOKE

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.130
A SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE BUT TO,

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.760
IN ESSENCE, CATCH THE BRAIN

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.430
RED-HANDED IN THE MIDDLE

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.360
OF A CONSCIOUS ACT OF FAITH.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.660
THEY'RE NOT JUST A SIMPLE

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.760
QUIETING OF THE MIND, PER SE,

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.200
BUT THAT THERE'S LOTS

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.300
OF DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON,

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.530
THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT PARTS

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.200
OF THE BRAIN INVOLVED THAT HELP

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.300
TO CREATE FOR US THESE VERY

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.330
POWERFUL KIND OF EMOTIONAL

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.360
AND COGNITIVE EXPERIENCES THAT

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.600
WE LABEL AS SPIRITUAL.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.100
Reporter: NOW EVERYONE

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.160
DOESN'T MEDIATE AS PART

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.300
OF HIS OR HER RELIGIOUS

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.660
PRACTICE.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.430
SOME PEOPLE WOULD CALL WHAT IS

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:03.500
CENTRAL TO HIS OR HER RELIGIOUS

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.400
PRACTICE PRAYING.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.400
DO YOU FIND THE SAME KINDS

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.200
OF BRAIN ACTIVITY DURING WHAT

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.660
SOME OTHER TRADITIONS WOULD CALL

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.500
PRAYING OR PRAYING DEEPLY

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.830
OR PRAYING FOR A LONG TIME

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:11.630
OR PRAYING FULLY?

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.630
ABSOLUTELY.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:14.760
EVEN WHEN PEOPLE PRAY THEY HAVE

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.000
A SENSE OF CONNECTING

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.900
WITH SOMETHING GREATER THAN

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.260
THEMSELVES.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.100
Reporter: NOW THAT YOU HAVE

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.160
BEEN ABLE TO MAP WHAT IS GOING

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.560
ON IN THE BRAIN WHILE PEOPLE ARE

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.530
HAVING CERTAIN KINDS

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:25.660
OF EXPERIENCES, WHEN PEOPLE ARE

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.100
HAVING DEEPLY MEDITATIVE

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.060
OR PRAYERFUL EXPERIENCES, WHAT

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.560
ELSE WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW?

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.830
WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.300
WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN IS

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.430
SEEING THE LINK BETWEEN WHAT

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.500
HAPPENS DURING SPIRITUAL

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.700
PRACTICES AND EXPERIENCES

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.630
TO PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.660
HEALTH.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.430
SO THAT WE CAN SEE EXACTLY WHY,

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.500
WHEN PEOPLE PRAY OR MEDITATE,

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.600
WHY THEY LOWER THEIR BLOOD

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.700
PRESSURE, WHY THEY MAY AFFECT

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.960
THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.530
OR THEIR HORMONE SYSTEM, ALL

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:49.760
CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.900
TO OCCUR BUT PEOPLE DON'T

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.800
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHY THAT'S

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.730
HAPPENING.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.560
Reporter: THERE ARE SOME WHO

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.330
MIGHT ARGUE THAT ULTIMATELY

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.030
TRYING TO SORT OF FIND WAYS

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.660
TO KIND OF REPLICATE

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.160
THE HEALTHFUL OR BENEFICIAL

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.900
EFFECTS OF THE RELIGIOUS

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:06.860
EXPERIENCE SO THAT IT CAN BE

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.630
DISPENSED.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.030
WHICH IS NOT WHAT RELIGION IS

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.330
FOR.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.630
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.800
AND WE ACTUALLY REALLY DO NOT

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.300
FEEL THAT THE WAY OF SOME

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.360
OF OUR COLLEAGUES, WHICH IS THAT

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.000
THERE ARE WAYS OF STIMULATING

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.160
THESE KINDS OF EXPERIENCES THAT

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.800
YOU MAY ULTIMATELY BE ABLE TO DO

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.600
SOMETHING WHERE PEOPLE WOULD

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.630
COME IN AND YOU'D STIMULATE

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:25.730
A PARTICULAR RELIGIOUS

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:26.700
EXPERIENCE AND THEN SEND THEM

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.730
OUT.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.960
I DON'T THINK OUR RESEARCH

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.960
SUGGESTS THAT.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.100
IN FACT, WHAT I THINK IT SHOWS

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.060
IS THAT THESE ARE VERY COMPLEX

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.900
KIND OF EXPERIENCES.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.600
SOMETHING THAT IS FAR DEEPER

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.530
THAN WHAT SOMEBODY COULD JUST

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:39.460
STIMULATE THROUGH ELECTRODES

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.700
OR THROUGH SOME TYPE OF DRUG

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:41.630
EXPERIENCE OR SOMETHING LIKE

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.730
THAT.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.260
Reporter: AND YET,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.830
WITHOUT ELECTRODES OR DRUGS,

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.030
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.030
DR. MICHAEL BAIME IS DISPENSING.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.500
AND OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.660
WE'VE TRAINED MORE THAN

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.960
1,300 PEOPLE TO PRACTICE THESE

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.230
ANCIENT TECHNIQUES.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.960
AND I JUST KNOW THAT IT MAKES

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.960
A DIFFERENCE.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.860
I DON'T NEED A BRAIN SCAN

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.800
TO TELL ME THAT THESE TWO PEOPLE

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.060
ARE HEALTHIER, THAT THEY FEEL

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:06.960
BETTER, THAT THEY FUNCTION

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.800
BETTER IN THEIR LIVES.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.430
THEY TELL US AND WE HAVE

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.030
STUDIES, RESEARCH THAT SHOWS

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.800
THAT THAT'S THE CASE.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.100
Reporter: YOU'RE MAPPING

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.160
THE WAY THE BRAIN BEHAVES

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.060
DURING A CERTAIN KIND

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.230
OF SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.130
ISN'T THE INESCAPABLE CONCLUSION

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.800
THAT THOSE SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.060
ARE A FUNCTION OF THE BRAIN'S

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.460
ACTIVITY, THAT THE BRAIN IS

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.460
DOING THIS RATHER THAN GOD DOING

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.400
THIS?

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.060
SOMEBODY WHO IS VERY

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.560
RELIGIOUS MIGHT LOOK AT THIS

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.360
AND SAY, "YOU KNOW, OF COURSE

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.300
THIS MAKES SENSE.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:36.960
IF GOD IS UP THERE AND WE'RE

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.500

OF CONTACT AND SOME KNOWLEDGE

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.700
OF GOD, THEN OUR BRAINS

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.160
NECESSARILY WOULD BE DESIGNED

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.760
BY GOD, PERHAPS, TO HAVE THAT

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.900
ABILITY, TO HAVE THAT

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.200
EXPERIENCE, TO HAVE THAT SENSE

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.160
OF COMMUNICATION OR UNION

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.530

Reporter: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.100
WELL, I THINK THE ANSWER

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.060
ACTUALLY LIES SOMEWHERE

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.630
IN BETWEEN, AND I THINK THAT

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.900
WE CAN'T REALLY GET AT THE TRUE

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.630
ANSWERS ABOUT WHAT IS OUT THERE

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.200
IN REALITY WITHOUT LOOKING

AT BOTH THE SCIENTIFIC AS WELL

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.900
AS THE SPIRITUAL PERSPECTIVE.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.800
AND WHETHER THAT ULTIMATE

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.760
REALITY BECOMES JUST PHYSICAL,

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.000
MATERIAL REALITY, OR SOMETHING

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.860
THAT IS VERY SPIRITUAL

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.400
AND DIVINE IN ITS ORIENTATION,

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.760
THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT WE,

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.030
THAT ALL HUMAN BEINGS ULTIMATELY

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.500
HAVE TO FACE AND COME TO TERMS

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.500

A COMING TO TERMS WHEN IT COMES

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.000
TO SPIRITUALITY AND THE BRAIN.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.900
WHETHER WE CALL IT GOD

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:34.260
OR SOMETHING ULTIMATE

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260

OF REALITY, THE FUNDAMENTAL

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:39.760
NATURE, IT'S HARD TO GET AROUND

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.330
SOME KIND OF LABEL.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.660
YOU COULD CALL IT EMPTINESS,

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.530
AS SOME SCHOOLS OF BUDDHISM DO.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.600

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.500
ABSOLUTE.

THAT CAN BE DESCRIBED IN WORDS.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.030
I THINK THAT THIS EXPERIENCE IS

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.900
BIGGER THAN THE KINDS OF THING

00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:00.360

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:15.500

HAPPENS IN THE BRAIN TO SUSTAIN

IT FORCES US TO REALLY THINK

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.660

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.430
SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER THAN US.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.560

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.700
IMPORTANTLY, WE CAN LOOK TO SEE

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.100
WHAT EXTENT THOSE PROCESSES ARE

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.960
ACTUALLY ACCURATE,

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.730
BECAUSE WE CAN NOW DO OTHER

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.060
KINDS OF EXPERIMENTS, LIKE

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.400
OUR MEDIUMSHIP EXPERIMENTS,

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.330
TO DOCUMENT THEIR VERACITY.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.430
Reporter: THE EXPERIMENTS

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.930
WITH THE MEDIUMS INVOLVE

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.200
COMPARING THE BRAIN WAVES

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.260
AND HEART RATES OF BOTH

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.230
THE MEDIUM AND THE PERSON

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:58.300
FOR WHOM HE OR SHE IS TRYING

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.300
TO CONTACT THE DEAD.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.860
AND ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.930
QUESTIONS IS, HOW DOES A MEDIUM

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.060
RECEIVE THIS KIND

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.060
OF INFORMATION?

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.160
TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THEY USING

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.130
SPECIFIC REGIONS OF THE BRAIN

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:10.330
WHICH ARE PURPORTEDLY ASSOCIATED

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.760
WITH OTHER KINDS OF MYSTICAL

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.930
OR RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCES?

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.260
FOR EXAMPLE, THE RIGHT TEMPORAL

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.530
LOBE, WHICH SOME PEOPLE CALL

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:18.800
THE "GOD SPOT," IS THIS REGION

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.560
ACTIVATED WITHIN A GENUINE

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.900
MEDIUM?

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.800
THE MEDIUMSHIP RESEARCH IS

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.330
ACTUALLY A WINDOW OR A DOORWAY,

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.860
IF YOU WILL, TO A MUCH LARGER

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.160
SPIRITUAL REALITY WHICH

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.300
INTEGRATES ANCIENT WISDOM

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.760
WITH CONTEMPORARY SCIENCE.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.000
WHAT'S FASCINATING IS THAT

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.900
SCIENCE IS TAKING ME

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:37.930
TO SPIRITUALITY, NOT TAKING IT

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.530
AWAY.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:41.330
IT'S ACTUALLY TAKING ME THERE.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.030
Reporter: FOR SCHWARTZ,

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.730
HIS RESEARCH CAN ONLY CONCLUDE

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:46.930
THAT THE HUMAN BRAIN IS WIRED

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.800
TO RECEIVE SIGNALS FROM A GRAND

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.600
ORGANIZING DESIGN, OR G.O.D.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.660
FOR SHORT.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.030
SURVIVAL OF CONSCIOUS TELLS

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:59.200
US THAT CONSCIOUSNESS DOES NOT

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.100
REQUIRE A BRAIN AND THAT

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.130
OUR MEMORIES, OUR INTENTIONS,

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.700
OUR INTELLIGENCE, OUR DREAMS

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.660
THAT ALL OF THAT CAN EXIST

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:15.900
OUTSIDE OF THE PHYSICAL BODY.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.060
NOW, BY THE WAY, THAT'S THE SAME

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.900
IDEA THAT WE HAVE ABOUT GOD,

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:25.300
THAT SOMETHING THAT IS

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.160
"INVISIBLE," THAT IS "BIGGER

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:26.900
THAN

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.030
ALL OF US" WHICH WE CANNOT SEE

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.100
CAN HAVE INTELLECT, CREATIVITY,

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.030
INTENTION, MEMORY AND CAN

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:30.960
INFLUENCE THE UNIVERSE.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.060
Reporter: IT SHOULD COME

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.030
AS NO SURPRISE THAT SCHWARTZ

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.400
AND HIS WORK WITH MEDIUMS HAS

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.600
ITS DETRACTORS.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.630
IN FACT, A NUMBER OF HIS PEERS,

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.400
NOT TO MENTION MEMBERS

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.030
OF THE PUBLIC, CONSIDER IT

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:40.430
RIDICULOUS.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:41.160
WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE SINCE IT

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:41.860
SEEMS ABSURD, AS ABSURD AS IT

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.430
ONCE WAS TO SUGGEST THAT

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:48.500
THE SUN, NOT THE EARTH, IS

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.630
THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.000
IT IS TOO SOON TO SAY WHETHER

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.100
ANY OF THESE INQUIRIES

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.600
INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.660
MIND, BODY AND SPIRIT WILL PROVE

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.200
TO BE MERE DIVERSIONS

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.160
OR AS EARTH-SHATTERING

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.060
AS GALILEO'S DISCOVERY.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.930
BUT THE INVESTIGATIONS WILL GO

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.730
ON, BECAUSE THE HUMAN DESIRE

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.900
TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND IS

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.560
INFINITE.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.430
OMORROW ON "NIGHTLINE."

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:15.300
THAT'S OUR REPORT

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.700
FOR TONIGHT.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.900
I'M CHRIS BURY IN WASHINGTON.
