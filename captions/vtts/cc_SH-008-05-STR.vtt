00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.030


2
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.870
How doth the king?

3
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.470
Excellent well.

4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.700
His cares are now all ended.

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.530
I hope, not dead.

6
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.970
He's walked the way of nature.

7
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.930
To our purposes, he lives no more.

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.970
I would His Majesty had called me with him.

9
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.030
The service that I truly did his life

10
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.970
hath left me open to all injuries.

11
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.070
Indeed, I think the young king loves you not.

12
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.430
I know he doth not

13
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.370
and do arm myself to welcome the condition of the time,

14
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.400
which cannot look more hideously upon me

15
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.870
than I have drawn it in my fantasy.

16
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.570
Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry.

17
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.870
Oh, that the living Harry

18
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.100
had the temper of either worst of these three gentlemen.

19
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.370
How many nobles then might keep their place

20
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.270
that must strike sail to spirits of vile sort.

21
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.630
Oh, God, I fear all will be overthrown.

22
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.470
Good morrow, and God save Your Majesty.

23
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.870
This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,

24
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.000
sits not so easy on me as you think.

25
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.670
Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear.

26
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.070
This is the English, not the Turkish court.

27
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.430
Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds, but Harry Harry.

28
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.500
Yet be sad, good brothers,

29
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.930
for, by my faith, it very well becomes you.

30
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.230
Sorrow so royally in you appears

31
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.830
that I will deeply put the fashion on

32
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.000
and wear it in my heart.

33
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.730
Why then, be sad.

34
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.370
But entertain no more of it, good brothers,

35
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.400
than a joint burden laid upon us all.

36
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.070
For me, by heaven, I bid you be assured,

37
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.130
I'll be your father and your brother too.

38
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.600
Let me but bear your love, and I'll bear your cares.

39
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.270
Yet weep that Harry's dead, and so will I.

40
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.930
But Harry lives that shall convert those tears

41
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.400
by number into hours of happiness.

42
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.770
We hope no otherwise from Your Majesty.

43
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.400
You all look strangely on me,

44
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.700
and you most.

45
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.470
You are, I think, assured I love you not.

46
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.430
I am assured, if I be rightly measured,

47
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.830
Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me.

48
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.570
No?

49
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.000
How might a prince of my great hopes

50
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.900
forget so great indignities you laid upon me?

51
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.330
What?

52
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.130
Rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison

53
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.970
the immediate heir of England.

54
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.770
Was this easy?

55
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.830
May this be washed in lethe and forgotten?

56
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.430
I then did use the person of your fatheró

57
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.730
the image of his power lay then in meó

58
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.300
and, in the administration of his law,

59
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.100
whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,

60
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.730
Your Highness pleased to forget my place,

61
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.470
the majesty and power of law and justice,

62
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.170
the image of the king whom I presented,

63
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.170
and struck me in my very seat of judgment,

64
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.730
whereon, as an offender to your father,

65
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.730
I gave bold way to my authority and did commit you.

66
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.970
If this were ill done,

67
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.170
be you contented wearing now the garland,

68
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.170
to have a son set your decrees at naught,

69
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.370
to pluck down justice from your awful bench,

70
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.930
to trip the course of law and blunt the sword

71
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.100
that guards the peace and safety of your person.

72
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.500
Behold yourself so by a son disdained,

73
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.570
and then imagine me taking your part

74
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.770
and in your power soft silencing your son.

75
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.770
After this cold considerance, sentence me.

76
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.900
And, as you are a king,

77
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.030
speak in your state what I have done

78
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.430
that misbecame my place, my person,

79
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.170
or my liege's sovereignty.

80
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.430
You are right, Justice,

81
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.670
and you weigh this well.

82
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.170
Therefore still bear the balance and the sword.

83
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.300
And I do wish your honors may increase

84
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.830
till you do live to see a son of mine

85
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.800
offend you and obey you, as I did.

86
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.730
So shall I live to speak my father's words.

87
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.230
"Happy am I that have a man so bold

88
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.430
"that dares do justice on my proper son,

89
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.870
"and not less happy, having such a son,

90
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.530
"that would deliver up his greatness

91
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.200
so into the hands of justice."

92
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.970
You did commit me,

93
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.430
for which, I do commit into your hand the unstained sword

94
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.700
that you have used to bear, with this remembrance:

95
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.930
that you use the same

96
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.500
with the like bold, just, and impartial spirit

97
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.730
that you have used 'gainst me.

98
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:40.900
There is my hand.

99
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.470
You shall be as a father to my youth.

100
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.500
My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,

101
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.600
and I will stoop and humble my intents

102
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.030
to your well-practiced, wise directions.

103
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.270
And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you.

104
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.770
My father is gone wild into his grave,

105
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.970
for in his tomb lie my affections.

106
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.830
And with his spirit sadly I survive

107
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:18.270
to mock the expectation of the world, to frustrate prophecies,

108
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.430
and to raze out rotten opinion,

109
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.730
who hath writ me down after my seeming.

110
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.230
The tide of blood in me

111
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.470
hath proudly flowed in vanity till now.

112
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.170
Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,

113
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.000
where it shall mingle with the state of floods

114
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.630
and flow henceforth in formal majesty.

115
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.070
Now call we our high court of parliament.

116
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.830
And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel

117
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.530
that the great body of our state may go

118
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.730
in equal rank with the best governed nation,

119
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.630
that war or peace or both at once

120
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.400
may be as things acquainted and familiar to us,

121
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.230
in which you, Father, shall have foremost hand.

122
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.600
Our coronation done, we will accite,

123
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.870
as I before remembered, all our state.

124
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.170
And, God consigning to my good intents,

125
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:24.930
no prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,

126
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.000
"God shorten Harry's happy life one day."

127
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.630
God save the king!

128
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.470
Sir John, you shall see my orchard,

129
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.330
where, in an arbor,

130
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.870
we will eat the last year's pippin of my own grafting

131
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.970
and a dish of caraways, and so forth.

132
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.470
Come, cousin Silence, and then to bed.

133
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.530
'Fore God, you have a goodly dwelling here and rich.

134
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.100
Barren, barren, barren.

135
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.430
Beggars all; beggars all, Sir John.

136
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.470
Marry, good air.

137
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.870
Well spread, Davy; well spread, Davy.

138
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:05.970
Well said, Davy.

139
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.130
This Davy serves you in good uses.

140
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.700
He is your servingman and your husband.

141
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.000
He's a good varlet, a good varlet, a good varlet.

142
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.570
He's a good varlet, Sir John.

143
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:22.430
Oh, by the mass, I have drunk too much sack at supper.

144
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.070
A good varlet.

145
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.070
Now sit down.

146
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.070
Come on.

147
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.530
Now sit down.

148
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.400
Come, Cousin.

149
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.430
Ah, sirrah, quotha,

150
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:39.300
we shall do nothing but eat and make good cheer

151
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:43.930
and praise God for a merry year,

152
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:49.730
when flesh is cheap and females dear

153
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.630
and lusty lads roam here and there,

154
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.000
so merrily, so merrily,

155
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.370
and ever anon so merrily.

156
00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.130
There's a merry heart.

157
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.730
Good Master Silence, I'll give you a health for that anon.

158
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:15.170
Davy, give Master Bardolph some wine.

159
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.730
Sweet sir, sit.

160
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:18.900
I'll be with you anon.

161
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.870
Most sweet sir, sit.

162
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.530
Master page, good master page, sit.

163
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.270
And what you want in meat, we'll have in drink.

164
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.000
But you must bear.

165
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.570
The heart's all.

166
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.500
Master Bardolph, be merry,

167
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:37.170
and, my little soldier there, be merry.

168
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.930
Be merry; be merry.

169
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.330
My wife has all.

170
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.630
Women are shrews, both short and tall.

171
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:51.600
'Tis merry in hall when beards lack all

172
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.230
and welcome merry shrovetide.

173
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.600
Be merry; be merry.

174
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.000
I did not think Master Silence

175
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.930
to have been a man of this mettle.

176
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.570
An't please your worship,

177
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.730
there's one Pistol come from the court with news.

178
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.730
From the court?

179
00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.230
Let him come in.

180
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.000
How now, Pistol.

181
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.230
Sir John, God save you.

182
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.930
What wind blew you hither, Pistol?

183
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.530
Not the ill wind that blows no man to good.

184
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:25.770
Sweet knight,

185
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.130
thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm.

186
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.800
Sir John, I am thy Pistol and thy friend.

187
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.470
And helter-skelter have I rode to thee,

188
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.730
and tidings do I bring

189
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.830
and lucky joys and golden times and happy news of price.

190
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.000
I pray you now, deliver them like a man of this world.

191
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.570
A fouter for the world and worldlings base.

192
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:48.070
I speak of Africa and golden joys.

193
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.000
Oh, base Assyrian knight, what is thy news?

194
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.600
Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof.

195
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.130
Give me your pardon, sir.

196
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.800
If, sir, you come from the court with news,

197
00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.630
I take it there's but two ways,

198
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.530
either to utter them or conceal them.

199
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:08.630
I am, sir, under the king, in some authority.

200
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:12.330
Under which king, Besonian?

201
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.570
Speak or die.

202
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.700
Under King Harry.

203
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.500
Harry IV or

204
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.230
Harry IV.

205
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.970
A fouter for thine office.

206
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.770
Sir John, thy tender lambkin now is king.

207
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.630
Harry V's the man.

208
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.100
If Pistol lie, do this

209
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.770
and fig me like the bragging Spaniard.

210
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:34.830
What?

211
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.170
Is the old king dead?

212
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.400
As nail in door.

213
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.370
The things I speak are just.

214
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.670
Bardolph.

215
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.770
Away, Bardolph.

216
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.470
Saddle my horse.

217
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.770
Master Robert Shallow,

218
00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.130
choose what office thou wilt in the land.

219
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.470
'Tis thine.

220
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:59.330
Pistol, I will double charge thee with dignities.

221
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.900
Oh, joyful day.

222
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.070
I would not take a knighthood for my fortune.

223
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.630
I do bring good news.

224
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.830
Master Robert Shallowó my Lord Shallowó

225
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.400
be what thou wilt.

226
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.530
I am fortune's steward.

227
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.530
But go on.

228
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.530
Get on thy boots.

229
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:13.630
We'll ride all night.

230
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.170
Oh, sweet Pistol.

231
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:16.300
Away, Bardolph.

232
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.170
Here, boot, boot, Master Shallow.

233
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.670
I know the young king is sick for me.

234
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.770
Oh, let us take any man's horses.

235
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.670
The laws of England are at my commandment.

236
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.470
Blessed are they that have been my friends,

237
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:34.930
and woe to my lord chief justice.

238
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.200
Come!

239
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.930
Stand back!

240
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.670
Standóstand here by me, Master Robert Shallow.

241
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.570
I will make the king do you grace.

242
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.730
I will leer upon him as a' comes by.

243
00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.070
And do but mark the countenance he will give me.

244
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.970
God bless thy lungs, good knight.

245
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.170
Come here, Pistol.

246
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.500
Stand behind me.

247
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.400
Oh, I would I'd had time to have made new liveries.

248
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.470
I would have bestowed

249
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.770
the thousand pound I borrowed of you.

250
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.000
But 'tis no matter.

251
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.630
This poor show doth better.

252
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.400
This doth infer the zeal I had to see him.

253
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.500
It doth so.

254
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.030
It shows my earnestness of affection.

255
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.030
It dothó

256
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.070
My devotionó

257
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.100
It doth; it doth; it doth.

258
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.730
As it were, to ride day and night,

259
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.600
and not to deliberate, not to remember,

260
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.470
not to have patience to shift meó

261
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.470
'Tis best, certain.

262
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:29.430
But to stand stained with travel

263
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.670
and sweating with desire to see him,

264
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:32.830
thinking of nothing else,

265
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.730
putting all affairs else into oblivion,

266
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.700
as if there were nothing else to be done but to see him.

267
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.430
God save Thy Grace, King Hal.

268
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.030
My royal Hal.

269
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.770
God save thee, my sweet boy.

270
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.870
My lord chief justice, speak to that vain man.

271
00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.670
Have you your wits?

272
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.170
Know you what 'tis you speak?

273
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:04.170
My king.

274
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.670
My Jove.

275
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.070
I speak to thee, my heart.

276
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.970
I know thee not, old man.

277
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:21.700
Fall to thy prayers.

278
00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.670
How ill white hairs become a fool and jester.

279
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.030
I have long dreamt of such a kind of man,

280
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:37.470
so surfeit swelled, so old, and so profane.

281
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.230
But, being awaked, I do despise my dream.

282
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:48.770
Make less thy body hence and more thy grace.

283
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.100
Leave gormandizing.

284
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.330
Know the grave doth gape for thee

285
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.870
thrice wider than for other men.

286
00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.130
Reply not to me with a fool born jest.

287
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.000
Presume not I am the thing I was,

288
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.800
for God doth know, so shall the world perceive,

289
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.700
that I have turned away my former self.

290
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:15.000
So will I those that kept me company.

291
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.270
When thou dost hear I am as I have been,

292
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.270
approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,

293
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.930
the tutor and feeder of my riots.

294
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:31.430
Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,

295
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.300
as I have done the rest of my misleaders,

296
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.270
not to come near our person by ten mile.

297
00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:45.730
For competence of life, I will allow you

298
00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.500
that lack of means enforce you not to evils.

299
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.030
And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,

300
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:57.470
we will, according to your strengths and qualities,

301
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.770
give you advancement.

302
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.030
Be it your charge, my lord,

303
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:10.770
to see performed the tenor of our word.

304
00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.070
Set on.

305
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.530
God save the king!

306
00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.200
God save the king!

307
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.130
God save the king!

308
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:48.430
God save the king!

309
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.900
God save the king!

310
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.170
Master Shallow,

311
00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.570
I owe you a thousand pound.

312
00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:02.870
Marry, Sir John,

313
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:07.900
which I beseech you to let me have home with me.

314
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.470
That can hardly be, Master Shallow.

315
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.670
Do not you grieve at this.

316
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:19.700
I shall be sent for in private to him.

317
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:24.500
Look, he must seem thus to the world.

318
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.100
Fear not your advancement.

319
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.170
I shall be the man yet that will make you great.

320
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:30.170
I cannot perceive how,

321
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:35.230
unless you give me your doublet and stuff me out with straw.

322
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:36.700
I beseech you, Sir John,

323
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.670
let me have 500 of my 1,000.

324
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.030
Sir, I will be as good as my word.

325
00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:51.500
This that you heard was but a color.

326
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.970
A color I fear you will die in, Sir John.

327
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.370
Oh, no, fear no colors.

328
00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.000
Come.

329
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.700
Go with me to dinner.

330
00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.170
Come, Lieutenant Pistol.

331
00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:03.430
Come, Bardolph.

332
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.530
I shall be sent for to him in private at night.

333
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.430
Carry Sir John Falstaff to the fleet.

334
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.100
Take all his company along with him.

335
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.400
My lord.

336
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.900
My lord.

337
00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.470
I cannot now speak.

338
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.470
I shall hear you soon.

339
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:21.570
Take them away.

340
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:27.930
"Si fortuna me tormenta, spero me contento."

341
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.230
I like this fair proceeding of the king's.

342
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:34.970
He hath intent his wonted followers

343
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:38.330
shall all be very well provided for,

344
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.570
but all are banished till their conversations

345
00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:44.130
appear more wise and modest to the world.

346
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.070
And so they are.

347
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:48.730
The king hath called his parliament, my lord.

348
00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:49.930
He hath.

349
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.470
I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,

350
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:57.970
we bear our civil swords and native fire as far as France.

351
00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.470
I heard a bird so sing, whose music, to my thinking,

352
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.300
pleased the king.

353
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.900
