00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:31.670


2
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.330
Escalus.

3
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.970
My lord.

4
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.170
Of government the properties to unfold,

5
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.470
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;

6
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.930
Since I am put to know that your own science

7
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.730
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice

8
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.200
My strength can give you: then no more remains,

9
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.000
But that to your sufficiency

10
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.430
as your Worth is able,

11
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.930
And let them work.

12
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.570
The nature of our people,

13
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.670
Our city's institutions,

14
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.930
and the terms for common justice,

15
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.700
you're as pregnant in as art and practise

16
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.300
hath enriched any that we remember.

17
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.300
There is our commission,

18
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.470
From which we would not have you warp.

19
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.570
Bid come before us Angelo.

20
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.500
What figure of us think you he will bear?

21
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.500
For you must know, we have with special soul

22
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.870
Elected him our absence to supply,

23
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.130
Lent him our terror,

24
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.400
dress'd him with our love,

25
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.330
And given his deputation

26
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.000
all the organs of our own power:

27
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.370
what think you of it?

28
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.800
If any in Vienna be of worth

29
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.230
To undergo such ample grace and honour,

30
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.770
It is Lord Angelo.

31
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.000
Always obedient to your grace's will,

32
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.570
I come to know your pleasure.

33
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.130
Angelo,

34
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.070
There is a kind of character in thy life,

35
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.900
That to the observer doth thy history

36
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.200
Fully unfold.

37
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.730
Thyself and thy belongings

38
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.700
Are not thine own so proper as to waste

39
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.100
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.

40
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.500
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,

41
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.900
Not light them for themselves;

42
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.370
(laughing)

43
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.670
for if our virtues did not go forth of us,

44
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.230
'twere all alike as if we had them not.

45
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.270
Spirits are not finely touch'd

46
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.030
But to fine issues,

47
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.370
nor Nature never lends

48
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.930
The smallest scruple of her excellence

49
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.130
But, like a thrifty goddess,

50
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.500
she determines herself the glory of a creditor,

51
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.200
Both thanks and use.

52
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.700
But I do bend my speech

53
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.870
to one that can my part in him advertise;

54
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.500
Hold therefore, Angelo:--

55
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.330
In our remove be thou at full ourself;

56
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.470
Mortality and mercy in Vienna

57
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.770
Live in thy tongue and heart:

58
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.730
old Escalus, though first in question,

59
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.570
is thy secondary.

60
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.070
Take thy commission.

61
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.370
Now, good my lord,

62
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.170
Let there be some more test made of my metal,

63
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.830
Before so noble and so great a figure

64
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.370
Be stamp'd upon it.

65
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.870
No more evasion:

66
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.400
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice

67
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.570
Proceeded to you;

68
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.930
therefore take your honours.

69
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.470
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition

70
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.770
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd

71
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.500
Matters of needful value.

72
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.970
We shall write to you,

73
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.230
As time and our concernings shall importune,

74
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.270
How it goes with us, and do seek to know

75
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.770
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;

76
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.570
To the hopeful execution do I leave you

77
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.500
Of your commissions.

78
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.500
Yet give leave, my lord,

79
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.600
That we may bring you something on the way.

80
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.430
My haste may not admit it;

81
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.830
Nor need you, on mine honour,

82
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.930
have to do with any scruple;

83
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.030
your scope is as mine own

84
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.870
So to enforce or qualify the laws

85
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.570
As to your soul seems good.

86
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.600
Give me your hand:

87
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.530
I'll privily away.

88
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.700
I love the people,

89
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.400
But do not like to stage me to their eyes:

90
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.900
Through it do well,

91
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.230
I do not relish well

92
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.770
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;

93
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.130
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion

94
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.570
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

95
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.470
The heavens give safety to your purposes!

96
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.530
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!

97
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.130
I shall desire you, sir,

98
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.870
to give me leave to have free speech with you;

99
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.200
and it concerns me

100
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.800
to look into the bottom of my place:

101
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.700
A power I have, but of what strength and nature

102
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.970
I am not yet instructed.

103
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.170
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,

104
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.170
And we may soon our satisfaction have

105
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.930
Touching that point.

106
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.870
I'll wait upon your honour.

107
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.100
If the duke with the other dukes come not

108
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.530
to composition with the King of Hungary,

109
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.900
why then all the dukes fall upon the king.

110
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.570
Heaven grant us its peace,

111
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.830
but not the King of Hungary's!

112
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.400
Amen.

113
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.430
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate

114
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.200
that went to sea with the Ten Commandments,

115
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.100
but scraped one out of the table.

116
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.200
'Thou shalt not steal'?

117
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.670
Ay, that he razed.

118
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.300
Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain

119
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.070
and all the rest from their functions:

120
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.670
they put forth to steal.

121
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.630
There's not a soldier of us all, that,

122
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.500
in the thanksgiving before meat,

123
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.870
do relish the petition well that prays for peace.

124
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.470
I never heard any soldier dislike it.

125
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.570
I believe thee;

126
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.030
for I think thou never wast where grace was said.

127
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.300
No? a dozen times at least.

128
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.500
What, in metre?

129
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.030
In any proportion or in any language.

130
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.400
I think, or in any religion.

131
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.970
Ay, why not? Grace is grace,

132
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.070
despite of all controversy:

133
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.600
as, for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain,

134
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.770
despite of all grace.

135
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.430
Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.

136
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.630
I grant; as there may between the lists

137
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.700
and the velvet. Thou art the list.

138
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.800
And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet;

139
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.530
thou'rt a three-piled piece, I warrant thee:

140
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.430
I had as lief be a list of an English kersey

141
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.000
as be piled, as thou art piled,

142
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.300
for a French velvet.

143
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.630
Do I speak feelingly now?

144
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.230
I think thou dost; and, indeed,

145
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.100
with most painful feeling of thy speech:

146
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.900
I will, out of thine own confession,

147
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.300
learn to begin thy health;

148
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.100
but, whilst I live, forget to drink after thee.

149
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.300
I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?

150
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.100
Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.

151
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.070
Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes!

152
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.370
I have purchased as many diseases

153
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.530
under her roof as come to--

154
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.630
How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?

155
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.930
Well, well; there's one yonder arrested

156
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.830
and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all.

157
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.900
Who's that, I pray thee?

158
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.430
Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.

159
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.630
Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.

160
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.730
Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested,

161
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.830
saw him carried away; and, which is more,

162
00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:02.230
within these three days his head to be chopped off.

163
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.300
But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.

164
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.700
Art thou sure of this?

165
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.770
I am too sure of it:

166
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.700
and it is for getting Madam Julietta with child.

167
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.730
Believe me, this may be:

168
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.700
he promised to meet me two hours since,

169
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.400
and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.

170
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.830
Besides, you know, it draws something near

171
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.270
to the speech we had to such a purpose.

172
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.600
But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.

173
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.700
Away! let's go learn the truth of it.

174
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.870
Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat,

175
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.170
what with the gallows and what with poverty,

176
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.970
I am custom-shrunk.

177
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.300
How now!

178
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.900
How now! what's the news with you?

179
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.730
Yonder man is carried to prison.

180
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.630
Well; what has he done?

181
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.970
A woman.

182
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.000
(laughing)

183
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.870
But what's his offence?

184
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.670
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.

185
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.500
What, is there a maid with child by him?

186
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:11.370
No, but there's a woman with maid by him.

187
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.970
You have not heard of the proclamation, have you?

188
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.730
What proclamation, man?

189
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.600
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna

190
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.770
must be plucked down.

191
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.470
And what shall become of those in the city?

192
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.600
They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,

193
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.500
but that a wise burgher put in for them.

194
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.300
But shall all our houses of resort

195
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.230
in the suburbs be pulled down?

196
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.300
To the ground, mistress.

197
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.670
Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!

198
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.730
What shall become of me?

199
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.530
Come; fear not you:

200
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.800
good counsellors lack no clients:

201
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.270
though you change your place,

202
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.400
you need not change your trade;

203
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.970
I'll be your tapster still.

204
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.570
Courage! there will be pity taken on you:

205
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:04.430
you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service,

206
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.200
you will be considered.

207
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.330
(laughing)

208
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.200
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?

209
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.930
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.

210
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.530
I do it not in evil disposition,

211
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.670
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.

212
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.530
Thus can the demigod Authority

213
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.500
Make us pay down for our offence by weight

214
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.600
The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;

215
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.700
On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.

216
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:34.230
Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?

217
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.600
From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:

218
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.900
As surfeit is the father of much fast,

219
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.330
So every scope by the immoderate use

220
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.430
Turns to restraint.

221
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:44.500
Our natures do pursue,

222
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.500
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,

223
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.530
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.

224
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.700
If could speak so wisely under an arrest,

225
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.170
I would send for certain of my creditors:

226
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.270
and yet, to say the truth,

227
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.600
I had as lief have the foppery of freedom

228
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.230
as the morality of imprisonment.

229
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.500
What's thy offence, Claudio?

230
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.370
What but to speak of would offend again.

231
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.530
What, is't murder?

232
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.470
No.

233
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.200
Lechery?

234
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.830
Call it so.

235
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:11.870
Away, sir! you must go.

236
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.930
One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

237
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.030
A hundred, if they'll do you any good.

238
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.730
Is lechery so look'd after?

239
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.630
Thus stands it with me:

240
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.730
upon a true contract

241
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.500
I got possession of Julietta's bed:

242
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.830
You know the lady; she is fast my wife,

243
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.330
Save that we do the denunciation lack

244
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.730
Of outward order:

245
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.270
this we came not to,

246
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.070
Only for propagation of a dower

247
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.870
Remaining in the coffer of her friends,

248
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.830
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love

249
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.870
Till time had made them for us.

250
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:41.900
But it chances the stealth

251
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.630
of our most mutual entertainment

252
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.970
With character too gross is writ on Juliet.

253
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.400
With child, perhaps?

254
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.630
Unhappily, even so.

255
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.300
And the new deputy now for the duke--

256
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.370
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,

257
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:59.330
Or whether that the body public

258
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.730
be a horse whereon the governor doth ride,

259
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.030
Who, newly in the seat,

260
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.230
that it may know he can command,

261
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.630
lets it straight feel the spur;

262
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.300
Whether the tyranny be in his place,

263
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.430
Or in his emmence that fills it up,

264
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.270
I stagger in:-

265
00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.570
but this new governor awakes me all the enrolled penalties

266
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.700
Which have, like unscour'd armour,

267
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.400
hung by the wall so long that nineteen zodiacs

268
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.170
have gone round

269
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.330
And none of them been worn;

270
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.670
and, for a name,

271
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.400
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act

272
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.030
Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.

273
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.130
I warrant it is:

274
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.470
and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders

275
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.300
that a milkmaid, if she be in love,

276
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.370
may sigh it off.

277
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:40.630
(crying)

278
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:52.270
Send after the duke and appeal to him.

279
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.800
I have done so, but he's not to be found.

280
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.230
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:

281
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.330
This day my sister should the cloister enter

282
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.130
And there receive her approbation:

283
00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.530
Acquaint her with the danger of my state:

284
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:04.730
Implore her, in my voice,

285
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.430
that she make friends to the strict deputy;

286
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.130
bid herself assay him:

287
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.470
I have great hope in that; for in her youth

288
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.630
There is a prone and speechless dialect,

289
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.870
Such as move men;

290
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.500
beside, she hath prosperous art

291
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.000
When she will play with reason and discourse,

292
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.770
And well she can persuade.

293
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:20.700
I pray she may;

294
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.500
as well for the encouragement of the like,

295
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.170
which else would stand under grievous imposition,

296
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.170
as for the enjoying of thy life,

297
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.900
who I would be sorry should be thus

298
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:33.630
foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack. I'll to her.

299
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:38.700
I thank you, good friend Lucio.

300
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.170
No, holy father; throw away that thought;

301
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.400
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love

302
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.470
Can pierce a complete bosom.

303
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:52.600
Why I desire thee

304
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.670
To give me secret harbour,

305
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.600
hath a purpose more grave and wrinkled

306
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.170
than the aims and ends of burning youth.

307
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.170
May your grace speak of it?

308
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.430
My holy sir, none better knows than you

309
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.870
How I have ever loved the life removed

310
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.830
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies

311
00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:11.000
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.

312
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.600
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,

313
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.200
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,

314
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.070
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,

315
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.170
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;

316
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.730
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,

317
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.800
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,

318
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.800
You will demand of me why I do this?

319
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.670
Gladly, my lord.

320
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:35.200
We have strict statutes and most biting laws.

321
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.230
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,

322
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.870
Which for this fourteen years we have let slip;

323
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.870
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,

324
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.870
That goes not out to prey.

325
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.070
Now, as fond fathers,

326
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.570
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,

327
00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.300
Only to stick it in their children's sight

328
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.230
For terror, not to use,

329
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:58.070
in time the rod becomes more mock'd

330
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.130
than fear'd; so our decrees,

331
00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.430
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;

332
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.270
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;

333
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:07.630
The baby beats the nurse,

334
00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.870
and quite athwart goes all decorum.

335
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.800
It rested in your grace

336
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.800
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:

337
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.230
And it in you more dreadful

338
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.070
would have seem'd than in Lord Angelo.

339
00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:26.500
I do fear, too dreadful:

340
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.700
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,

341
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.430
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them

342
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.670
For what I bid them do:

343
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.470
for we bid this be done,

344
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.330
When evil deeds have their permissive pass

345
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.370
And not the punishment.

346
00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.170
Therefore indeed, my father,

347
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.530
I have on Angelo imposed the office;

348
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.700
Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,

349
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.670
But my nature never in the fight

350
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.930
To do in slander.

351
00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.400
And to behold his sway,

352
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.200
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,

353
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.830
Visit both prince and people:

354
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:00.770
therefore, I prithee,

355
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.730
Supply me with the habit and instruct me

356
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.230
How I may formally in person

357
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.700
bear me like a true friar.

358
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.200
More reasons for this action

359
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.600
At our more leisure shall I render you;

360
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:16.530
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;

361
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.130
Stands at a guard with envy;

362
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.230
scarce confesses that his blood flows,

363
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.300
or that his appetite is more to bread than stone:

364
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.270
hence shall we see,

365
00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.400
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

366
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.400
And have you nuns no farther privileges?

367
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.430
Are not these large enough?

368
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.700
Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;

369
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.570
But rather wishing a more strict restraint

370
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.330
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.

371
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.730
Ho! Peace be in this place!

372
00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.100
Who's that which calls?

373
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.000
It is a man's voice.

374
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.200
Gentle Isabella, turn you the key,

375
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.400
and know his business of him;

376
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.870
You may, I may not; you are yet not sworn.

377
00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.830
When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men

378
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.130
But in the presence of the prioress:

379
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.730
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,

380
00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:09.530
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.

381
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.100
Hello! (off camera)

382
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.670
He calls again; I pray you, answer him.

383
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.970
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls

384
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.930
Hail, virgin, if you be,

385
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.900
as those cheek-roses proclaim you are no less!

386
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.770
Can you so stead me

387
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:36.300
as bring me to the sight of Isabella,

388
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.170
A novice of this place and the fair sister

389
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.300
To her unhappy brother Claudio?

390
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.730
Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,

391
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.730
The rather for I now must make you know

392
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.200
I am that Isabella and his sister.

393
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.430
Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:

394
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:56.130
Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.

395
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.100
Woe me! for what?

396
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.570
For that which, if myself might be his judge,

397
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.300
He should receive his punishment in thanks:

398
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.830
He hath got his friend with child.

399
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.900
Sir, make me not your story.

400
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.830
It is true.

401
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.570
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin

402
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.700
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,

403
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.730
Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:

404
00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:23.670
I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.

405
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.630
By your renouncement an immortal spirit,

406
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:27.700
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,

407
00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.630
As with a saint.

408
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:32.530
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.

409
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:36.730
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:

410
00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:44.430
Your brother and his lover have embraced:

411
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.330
As those that feed grow full,

412
00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.230
as blossoming time that from the seedness

413
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.870
the bare fallow brings to teeming foison,

414
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.530
even so her plenteous womb

415
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:56.230
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.

416
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:59.630
Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?

417
00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:00.970
Is she your cousin?

418
00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.100
Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names

419
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.030
By vain though apt affection.

420
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:05.970
She it is.

421
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.970
O, let him marry her.

422
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.430
This is the point.

423
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:12.500
The duke is very strangely gone from hence;

424
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.800
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,

425
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.470
In hand and hope of action:

426
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.530
but we do learn

427
00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.530
By those that know the very nerves of state,

428
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.900
His givings-out were of an infinite distance

429
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.000
From his true-meant design.

430
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Upon his place,

431
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.700
And with full line of his authority,

432
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.930
Governs Lord Angelo;

433
00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.900
a man whose blood is very snow-broth;

434
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:33.900
one who never feels

435
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.670
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,

436
00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.170
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge

437
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.730
With profits of the mind, study and fast.

438
00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.970
He--to give fear to use and liberty,

439
00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.100
Which have for long run by the hideous law,

440
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.430
As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,

441
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.630
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life

442
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:55.270
Falls into forfeit:

443
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.100
he arrests him on it;

444
00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.970
And follows close the rigour of the statute,

445
00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:00.970
To make him an example.

446
00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.730
All hope is gone,

447
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.630
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer

448
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.070
To soften Angelo:

449
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.000
and that's my pith of business

450
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.400
'Twixt you and your poor brother.

451
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.870
Doth he so seek his life?

452
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.730
Has censured him already;

453
00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:24.300
and, as I hear, the provost hath a warrant for his execution.

454
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.130
Alas! what poor ability's in me

455
00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.230
To do him good?

456
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.000
Assay the power you have.

457
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.570
My power? Alas, I doubt--

458
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.400
Our doubts are traitors

459
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.770
And make us lose the good we oft might win

460
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.830
By fearing to attempt.

461
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.070
Go to Lord Angelo,

462
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.830
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,

463
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:48.570
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,

464
00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.800
All their petitions are as freely theirs

465
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.170
As they themselves would owe them.

466
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.830
I'll see what I can do.

467
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.200
But speedily.

468
00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.600
I will about it straight;

469
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.270
No longer staying but to give the mother

470
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.430
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:

471
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:10.030
Commend me to my brother:

472
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.900
soon at night I'll send him certain word of my success.

473
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.600
I humbly take my leave.

474
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.430
Good sir, adieu.

475
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.800
