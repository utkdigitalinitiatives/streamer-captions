00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:12.370


2
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.300
If music be the food of love, play on;

3
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.200
Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,

4
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.030
The appetite may sicken, and so die.

5
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.900
That strain again! it had a dying fall:

6
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.070
O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,

7
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.370
That breathes upon a bank of violets,

8
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.200
Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:

9
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.900
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.

10
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.900
O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,

11
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.630
That, notwithstanding thy capacity

12
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.770
Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,

13
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.600
Of what validity and pitch soe'er,

14
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.470
But falls into abatement and low price,

15
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.670
Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy

16
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.230
That it alone is high fantastical.

17
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.730
Will you go hunt, my lord?

18
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.400
What, Curio?

19
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.300
The hart.

20
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.300
Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:

21
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.100
O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,

22
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.700
Methought she purged the air of pestilence!

23
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.600
That instant was I turn'd into a hart;

24
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.970
And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,

25
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.100
E'er since pursue me.

26
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.670
How now! what news from her?

27
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.170
So please my lord, I might not be admitted;

28
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.100
But from her handmaid do return this answer:

29
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.970
The element itself, till seven years' heat,

30
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.500
Shall not behold her face at ample view;

31
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.430
But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk

32
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.470
And water once a day her chamber round

33
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.800
With eye-offending brine: all this to season

34
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.970
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh

35
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.530
And lasting in her sad remembrance.

36
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.130
O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame

37
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.070
To pay this debt of love but to a brother,

38
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.270
How will she love, when the rich golden shaft

39
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.200
Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else

40
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.170
That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,

41
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.700
These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd

42
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.470
Her sweet perfections with one self king!

43
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.500
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:

44
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.600
Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.

45
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.870
What country, friends, is this?

46
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.070
This is Illyria, lady.

47
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.600
And what should I do in Illyria?

48
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.100
My brother he is in Elysium.

49
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.630
Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?

50
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.600
It is perchance that you yourself were saved.

51
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.730
O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.

52
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.800
True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,

53
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.100
Assure yourself, after our ship did split,

54
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.770
When you and those poor number saved with you

55
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.500
Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,

56
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.370
Most provident in peril, bind himself,

57
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.830
Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,

58
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.670
To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;

59
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.230
Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,

60
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.970
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves

61
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.300
So long as I could see.

62
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.930
For saying so, there's gold:

63
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.530
Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,

64
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.530
Whereto thy speech serves for authority,

65
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.800
The like of him. Know'st thou this country?

66
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.400
Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born

67
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.370
Not three hours' travel from this very place.

68
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.770
Who governs here?

69
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.670
A noble duke, in nature as in name.

70
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.370
What is the name?

71
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.300
Orsino.

72
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.530
Orsino! I have heard my father name him:

73
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.530
He was a bachelor then.

74
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.430
And so is now, or was so very late;

75
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.970
For but a month ago I went from hence,

76
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.470
And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,

77
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.570
What great ones do the less will prattle of,--

78
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.100
That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.

79
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.800
What's she?

80
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.570
A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count

81
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.400
That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her

82
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.870
In the protection of his son, her brother,

83
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.730
Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,

84
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.630
They say, she hath abjured the company

85
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.730
And sight of men.

86
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.970
O that I served that lady

87
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.970
And might not be delivered to the world,

88
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.630
Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,

89
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.230
What my estate is!

90
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.470
That were hard to compass;

91
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.170
Because she will admit no kind of suit,

92
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.130
No, not the duke's.

93
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.870
There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;

94
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.800
And though that nature with a beauteous wall

95
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.670
Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee

96
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.330
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits

97
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.430
With this thy fair and outward character.

98
00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.900
I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,

99
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.830
Conceal me what I am, and be my aid

100
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.130
For such disguise as haply shall become

101
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.530
The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:

102
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.730
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:

103
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.070
It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing

104
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.070
And speak to him in many sorts of music

105
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.100
That will allow me very worth his service.

106
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.370
What else may hap to time I will commit;

107
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.000
Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.

108
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.070
Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:

109
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.270
When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.

110
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.470
I thank thee: lead me on.

111
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.670
What a plague means my niece,

112
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.670
to take the death of her brother thus?

113
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.570
I am sure care's an enemy to life.

114
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:57.470
By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights:

115
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.030
your cousin, my lady, takes great

116
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.530
exceptions to your ill hours.

117
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.000
Why, let her except, before excepted.

118
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.230
Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest

119
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.330
limits of order.

120
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.700
Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:

121
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.230
these clothes are good enough to drink in;

122
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.230
and so be these boots too: an they be not,

123
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.600
let them hang themselves in their own straps.

124
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.300
That quaffing and drinking will undo you:

125
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.530
I heard my lady talk of it yesterday;

126
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.430
and of a foolish knight

127
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.570
that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.

128
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.900
Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?

129
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.370
Ay, he.

130
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.800
He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.

131
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.030
What's that to the purpose?

132
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.330
Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.

133
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.970
Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:

134
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.070
he's a very fool and a prodigal.

135
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.900
Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the viol-de-gamboys,

136
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.330
and speaks three or four languages

137
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.300
word for word without book,

138
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.870
and hath all the good gifts of nature.

139
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.330
He hath indeed, almost natural:

140
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.930
for besides that he's a fool, he's a great quarreller:

141
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.030
and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay

142
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.300
the gust he hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent

143
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.570
he would quickly have the gift of a grave.

144
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.530
By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors

145
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.070
that say so of him. Who are they?

146
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.970
They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.

147
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.800
With drinking healths to my niece:

148
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.230
I'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat

149
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.700
and drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill

150
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.900
that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn

151
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.370
o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!

152
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:35.030
Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.

153
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:47.600
Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!

154
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.970
Sweet Sir Andrew!

155
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.430
Bless you, fair shrew.

156
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.400
And you too, sir.

157
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.730
Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.

158
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:54.630
What's that?

159
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.800
My niece's chambermaid.

160
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.970
Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.

161
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.370
My name is Mary, sir.

162
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.630
Good Mistress Mary Accost,--

163
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.830
You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her,

164
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.400
board her, woo her, assail her.

165
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.730
By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company.

166
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.070
Is that the meaning of 'accost'?

167
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.230
Fare you well, gentlemen.

168
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.730
An thou let part so, Sir Andrew,

169
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.430
would thou mightst never draw sword again.

170
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.870
An you part so, mistress,

171
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.000
I would I might never draw sword again.

172
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.370
Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?

173
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.500
Sir, I have not you by the hand.

174
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.830
Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.

175
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.430
Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you,

176
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.900
bring your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.

177
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.800
Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?

178
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.000
It's dry, sir.

179
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.670
Why, I think so: I am not such an ass

180
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.130
but I can keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?

181
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.330
A dry jest, sir.

182
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:48.300
Are you full of them?

183
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.970
Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends:

184
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:56.400
marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.

185
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.870
O knight thou lackest a cup of canary:

186
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.100
when did I see thee so put down?

187
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.630
Never in your life, I think;

188
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.830
unless you see canary put me down.

189
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.570
Methinks sometimes I have no more wit

190
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.330
than a Christian or an ordinary man has:

191
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.630
but I am a great eater of beef

192
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.030
and I believe that does harm to my wit.

193
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.930
No question.

194
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.700
An I thought that, I'ld forswear it.

195
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.700
I'll ride home to-morrow, Sir Toby.

196
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.570
Pourquoi, my dear knight?

197
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.630
What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do?

198
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.700
I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues

199
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.970
that I have in fencing, dancing and bear-baiting:

200
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.570
O, had I but followed the arts!

201
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.770
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.

202
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.200
Why, would that have mended my hair?

203
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.570
Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.

204
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.900
But it becomes me well enough, does't not?

205
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.830
Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff;

206
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.800
and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs

207
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.230
and spin it off.

208
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.200
Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby:

209
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.900
your niece will not be seen; or if she be,

210
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.070
it's four to one she'll none of me:

211
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.970
the count himself here hard by woos her.

212
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.470
She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above her degree,

213
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:06.870
neither in estate, years, nor wit;

214
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:13.030
I have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't, man.

215
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.900
I'll stay a month longer.

216
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.830
I am a fellow o' the strangest mind i' the world;

217
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:21.700
I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.

218
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.900
Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?

219
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.130
As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be,

220
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.430
under the degree of my betters;

221
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.500
and yet I will not compare with an old man.

222
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.130
What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?

223
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.970
Faith, I can cut a caper.

224
00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:35.400
And I can cut the mutton to't.

225
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.430
And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong

226
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.300
as any man in Illyria.

227
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.900
Wherefore are these things hid?

228
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.470
wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em?

229
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.500
are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture?

230
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.400
why dost thou not go to church in a galliard

231
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.270
and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig;

232
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:57.470
I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace.

233
00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.700
What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?

234
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:05.100
I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg,

235
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.170
it was formed under the star of a galliard.

236
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.270
Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well

237
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.670
in a flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?

238
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.000
What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?

239
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.200
Taurus! That's sides and heart.

240
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.770
No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the caper;

241
00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:29.630
ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!

242
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.570
If the duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario,

243
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.430
you are like to be much advanced:

244
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.570
he hath known you but three days,

245
00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.600
and already you are no stranger.

246
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.730
You either fear his humour or my negligence,

247
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.570
that you call in question the continuance of his love:

248
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.470
is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?

249
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.130
No, believe me.

250
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.370
I thank you. Here comes the count.

251
00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.830
Who saw Cesario, ho?

252
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.830
On your attendance, my lord; here.

253
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:03.200
Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,

254
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.530
Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd

255
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.470
To thee the book even of my secret soul:

256
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.200
Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;

257
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.670
Be not denied access, stand at her doors,

258
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.830
And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow

259
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.830
Till thou have audience.

260
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:18.930
Sure, my noble lord,

261
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.400
If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow

262
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.900
As it is spoke, she never will admit me.

263
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.100
Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds

264
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.970
Rather than make unprofited return.

265
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.870
Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?

266
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.930
O, then unfold the passion of my love,

267
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.470
Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:

268
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.770
It shall become thee well to act my woes;

269
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.930
She will attend it better in thy youth

270
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.970
Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.

271
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.470
I think not so, my lord.

272
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.470
Dear lad, believe it;

273
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.670
For they shall yet belie thy happy years,

274
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.770
That say thou art a man: Diana's lip

275
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.630
Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe Is

276
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:02.830
as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,

277
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.370
And all is semblative a woman's part.

278
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.330
I know thy constellation is right apt

279
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.570
For this affair. Some four or five attend him;

280
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:15.230
All, if you will; for I myself am best

281
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.530
When least in company. Prosper well in this,

282
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.000
And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,

283
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.770
To call his fortunes thine.

284
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:23.700
I'll do my best

285
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.370
To woo your lady:

286
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.430
yet, a barful strife!

287
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:35.170
Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.

288
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.470
Nay, either tell me where thou hast been,

289
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.500
or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter

290
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.700
in way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.

291
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.970
Let her hang me:

292
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.330
he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colours.

293
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.430
Make that good.

294
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.500
He shall see none to fear.

295
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.630
A good lenten answer:

296
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.200
I can tell thee where that saying was born,

297
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.730
of 'I fear no colours.'

298
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.000
Where, good Mistress Mary?

299
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.970
In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.

300
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.930
Well, God give them wisdom that have it;

301
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.570
and those that are fools, let them use their talents.

302
00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.270
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent;

303
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:16.200
or, to be turned away,

304
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.030
is not that as good as a hanging to you?

305
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.200
Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage;

306
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.500
and, for turning away, let summer bear it out.

307
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.570
You are resolute, then?

308
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.570
Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.

309
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.700
That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both break,

310
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.770
your gaskins fall.

311
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.800
Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way;

312
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.770
if Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty

313
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.270
a piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.

314
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:42.370
Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my lady:

315
00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:45.070
make your excuse wisely, you were best.

316
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.330
Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!

317
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:50.530
Those wits, that think they have thee,

318
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.830
do very oft prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee,

319
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:57.830
may pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?

320
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.370
'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'

321
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.700
God bless thee, lady!

322
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.770
Take the fool away.

323
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.030
Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.

324
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:09.970
Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:

325
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.930
besides, you grow dishonest.

326
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.970
Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel

327
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.800
will amend: for give the dry fool drink,

328
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.300
then is the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend himself;

329
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.430
if he mend, he is no longer dishonest;

330
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.470
if he cannot, let the botcher mend him.

331
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.900
Any thing that's mended is but patched:

332
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.430
virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin;

333
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:32.630
and sin that amends is but patched with virtue.

334
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.330
If that this simple syllogism will serve, so;

335
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.230
if it will not, what remedy?

336
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:42.930
As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty's a flower.

337
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.130
The lady bade take away the fool;

338
00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:45.600
therefore, I say again, take her away.

339
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.700
Sir, I bade them take away you.

340
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.600
Misprision in the highest degree!

341
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.630
Good madonna,

342
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.900
give me leave to prove you a fool.

343
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.030
Can you do it?

344
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.200
Dexterously, good madonna.

345
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.100
Make your proof.

346
00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.430
I must catechise you for it, madonna:

347
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.700
good my mouse of virtue, answer me.

348
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.670
Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.

349
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.930
Good madonna, why mournest thou?

350
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.630
Good fool, for my brother's death.

351
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.770
I think his soul is in hell, madonna.

352
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.000
I know his soul is in heaven, fool.

353
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.700
The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's

354
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.830
soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.

355
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:26.400
What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?

356
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.900
Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:

357
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.570
infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.

358
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.030
God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the

359
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.330
better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn

360
00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.930
that I am no fox; but he will not pass his word

361
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.030
for two pence that you are no fool.

362
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.430
How say you to that, Malvolio?

363
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.630
I marvel your ladyship takes delight

364
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.630
in such a barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day

365
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.470
with an ordinary fool that has no more brain

366
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:58.000
than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard already;

367
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.670
unless you laugh and minister occasion to him,

368
00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:04.270
he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,

369
00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.870
that crow so at these set kind of fools,

370
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.570
no better than the fools' zanies.

371
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.970
Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio,

372
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.330
and taste with a distempered appetite.

373
00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.030
To be generous, guiltless and of free disposition,

374
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.970
is to take those things for bird-bolts

375
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.030
that you deem cannon-bullets:

376
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.830
there is no slander in an allowed fool,

377
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:26.200
though he do nothing but rail;

378
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.630
nor no railing in a known discreet man,

379
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.900
though he do nothing but reprove.

380
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.270
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou

381
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.700
speakest well of fools!

382
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.730
Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman

383
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.900
much desires to speak with you.

384
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.300
From the Count Orsino, is it?

385
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.070
I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.

386
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.530
Who of my people hold him in delay?

387
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:49.770
Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.

388
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.970
Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but madman:

389
00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.000
fie on him!

390
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.170
Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count,

391
00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:01.600
I am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.

392
00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.430
Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old,

393
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:09.630
and people dislike it.

394
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.900
Thou hast spoke for us, madonna,

395
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.370
as if thy eldest son should be a fool;

396
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:17.170
whose skull Jove cram with brains! for,--here he comes,

397
00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.070
--one of thy kin has a most weak pia mater.

398
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:24.770
By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?

399
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.500
A gentleman.

400
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.570
A gentleman! what gentleman?

401
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:36.500
'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' these pickle-herring!

402
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.770
How now, sot!

403
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:41.270
Good Sir Toby!

404
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.700
Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?

405
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:49.870
Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.

406
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.530
Ay, marry, what is he?

407
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.100
Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not:

408
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.500
give me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.

409
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.630
What's a drunken man like, fool?

410
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.600
Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man:

411
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.370
one draught above heat makes him a fool;

412
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.500
the second mads him; and a third drowns him.

413
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.870
Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my coz;

414
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.370
for he's in the third degree of drink,

415
00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:22.170
he's drowned: go, look after him.

416
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.100
He is but mad yet, madonna;

417
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.270
and the fool shall look to the madman.

418
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.400
Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you.

419
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.970
I told him you were sick;

420
00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.400
he takes on him to understand so much,

421
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.830
and therefore comes to speak with you.

422
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.170
I told him you were asleep;

423
00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.970
he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too,

424
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.600
and therefore comes to speak with you.

425
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.370
What is to be said to him, lady?

426
00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.800
he's fortified against any denial.

427
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.030
Tell him he shall not speak with me.

428
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.700
Has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your door

429
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.600
like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to a bench,

430
00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.800
but he'll speak with you.

431
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.430
What kind o' man is he?

432
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.200
Why, of mankind.

433
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.430
What manner of man?

434
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.030
Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.

435
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.970
Of what personage and years is he?

436
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.770
Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy;

437
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.770
as a squash is before 'tis a peascod,

438
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.630
or a cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him

439
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.930
in standing water, between boy and man.

440
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:25.000
He is very well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly;

441
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.400
one would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.

442
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.830
Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.

443
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.670
Gentlewoman, my lady calls.

444
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:39.030
Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.

445
00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:46.200
We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.

446
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.600
The honourable lady of the house, which is she?

447
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.670
Speak to me; I shall answer for her.

448
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:54.670
Your will?

449
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:59.600
Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,

450
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.930
--I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,

451
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.030
for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away

452
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:07.800
my speech, for besides that it is excellently well penned,

453
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.830
I have taken great pains to con it.

454
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:13.130
Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn;

455
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.030
I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.

456
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.300
Whence came you, sir?

457
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.800
I can say little more than I have studied,

458
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.800
and that question's out of my part. Good gentle one,

459
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.230
give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,

460
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.070
that I may proceed in my speech.

461
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.800
Are you a comedian?

462
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.800
No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs

463
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.870
of malice I swear, I am not that I play.

464
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.700
Are you the lady of the house?

465
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.470
If I do not usurp myself, I am.

466
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:44.170
Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself;

467
00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:47.530
for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve.

468
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.470
But this is from my commission:

469
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.370
I will on with my speech in your praise,

470
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.770
and then show you the heart of my message.

471
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.800
Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.

472
00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.800
Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.

473
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.270
It is the more like to be feigned:

474
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.470
I pray you, keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,

475
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.930
and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you

476
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:11.330
than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone;

477
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:13.830
if you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time

478
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.800
of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.

479
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.500
Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.

480
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.300
No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little longer.

481
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.730
Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady.

482
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.430
Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.

483
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.070
Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver,

484
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:36.270
when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.

485
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:42.000
It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war,

486
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.170
no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my hand;

487
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.600
my words are as fun of peace as matter.

488
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.800
Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?

489
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.370
The rudeness that hath appeared in me

490
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.800
have I learned from my entertainment.

491
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.000
What I am, and what I would,

492
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.730
are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears, divinity,

493
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.870
to any other's, profanation.

494
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:09.930
Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.

495
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.600
Now, sir, what is your text?

496
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.800
Most sweet lady,--

497
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.670
A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.

498
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:22.070
Where lies your text?

499
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.070
In Orsino's bosom.

500
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.230
In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?

501
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.870
To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.

502
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:33.330
O, I have read it: it is heresy.

503
00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.430
Have you no more to say?

504
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:39.830
Good madam, let me see your face.

505
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.570
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate

506
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:45.500
with my face? You are now out of your text:

507
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:50.470
but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.

508
00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:54.400
Look you, sir, such a one I was this present:

509
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.600
is't not well done?

510
00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.230
Excellently done, if God did all.

511
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:04.700
'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.

512
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.300
'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white

513
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.730
Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:

514
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.000
Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,

515
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.770
If you will lead these graces to the grave

516
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.400
And leave the world no copy.

517
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.030
O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted;

518
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.930
I will give out divers schedules of my beauty:

519
00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.730
it shall be inventoried, and every particle and utensil

520
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:31.930
labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,

521
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.500
indifferent red; item, two grey eyes,

522
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.800
with lids to them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth.

523
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.270
Were you sent hither to praise me?

524
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:44.570
I see you what you are, you are too proud;

525
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:50.700
But, if you were the devil, you are fair.

526
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:56.300
My lord and master loves you: O, such love

527
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.300
Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd

528
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.070
The nonpareil of beauty!

529
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.470
How does he love me?

530
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.170
With adorations, fertile tears,

531
00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:10.070
With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.

532
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.970
Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:

533
00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.830
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,

534
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:20.170
Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;

535
00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:25.670
In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;

536
00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.100
And in dimension and the shape of nature

537
00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.270
A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;

538
00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:32.670
He might have took his answer long ago.

539
00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:34.730
If I did love you in my master's flame,

540
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.170
With such a suffering, such a deadly life,

541
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.570
In your denial I would find no sense;

542
00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:41.770
I would not understand it.

543
00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:47.070
Why, what would you?

544
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.070
Make me a willow cabin at your gate,

545
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.970
And call upon my soul within the house;

546
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.500
Write loyal cantons of contemned love

547
00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:00.270
And sing them loud even in the dead of night;

548
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.000
Halloo your name to the reverberate hills

549
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
And make the babbling gossip of the air

550
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.900
Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest

551
00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.370
Between the elements of air and earth,

552
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.770
But you should pity me!

553
00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.130
You might do much.

554
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.000
What is your parentage?

555
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.930
Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:

556
00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.600
I am a gentleman.

557
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.800
Get you to your lord;

558
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.270
I cannot love him: let him send no more;

559
00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:35.200
Unless, perchance, you come to me again,

560
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:40.000
To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:

561
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.730
I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.

562
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.070
I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:

563
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:52.170
My master, not myself, lacks recompense.

564
00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:58.230
Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;

565
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.270
And let your fervor, like my master's,

566
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:05.800
be Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.

567
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:10.630
'What is your parentage?'

568
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.600
'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:

569
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.300
I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;

570
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.400
Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,

571
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:26.100
Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:

572
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.500
soft, soft!

573
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:34.070
Unless the master were the man. How now!

574
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:38.100
Even so quickly may one catch the plague?

575
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.430
Methinks I feel this youth's perfections

576
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:42.170
With an invisible and subtle stealth

577
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:49.100
To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.

578
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.600
What ho, Malvolio!

579
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.030
Here, madam, at your service.

580
00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.630
Run after that same peevish messenger,

581
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:58.170
The county's man: he left this ring behind him,

582
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:02.170
Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.

583
00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.930
Desire him not to flatter with his lord,

584
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:06.200
Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:

585
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.500
If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,

586
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.100
I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.

587
00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.730
Madam, I will.

588
00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.970
I do I know not what, and fear to find

589
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:22.300
Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.

590
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.500
Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;

591
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:34.270
What is decreed must be, and be this so.

592
00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.100
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?

593
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.100
Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since

594
00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.370
arrived but hither.

595
00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.170
She returns this ring to you, sir:

596
00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:47.400
you might have saved me my pains,

597
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.800
to have taken it away yourself.

598
00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.770
She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord

599
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.500
into a desperate assurance she will none of him:

600
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.830
and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to

601
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:57.130
come again in his affairs, unless it be to report

602
00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.600
your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.

603
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.630
She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.

604
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.130
Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her;

605
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:07.470
and her will is, it should be so returned:

606
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:10.530
if it be worth stooping for, there it lies in your eye;

607
00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.800
if not, be it his that finds it.

608
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:23.070
I left no ring with her: what means this lady?

609
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:29.300
Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!

610
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.600
She made good view of me; indeed, so much,

611
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.730
That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,

612
00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:37.630
For she did speak in starts distractedly.

613
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:40.400
She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion

614
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.130
Invites me in this churlish messenger.

615
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:46.370
None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.

616
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:53.430
I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,

617
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:57.030
Poor lady, she were better love a dream.

618
00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:01.500
Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,

619
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.830
Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.

620
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.500
How easy is it for the proper-false

621
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.900
In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!

622
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.630
Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!

623
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:17.330
For such as we are made of, such we be.

624
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:21.930
How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;

625
00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.130
And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;

626
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:27.870
And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.

627
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:31.930
What will become of this? As I am man,

628
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:34.530
My state is desperate for my master's love;

629
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:37.370
As I am woman,--now alas the day!--

630
00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:43.230
What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!

631
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:47.070
O time! thou must untangle this, not I;

632
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:50.570
It is too hard a knot for me to untie!

633
00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.800
