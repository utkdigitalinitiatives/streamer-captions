00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.370


2
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.470
Barkloughly Castle call they this at hand?

3
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.470
Yea, my lord.

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.570
How brooks Your Grace the air

5
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.200
after your late tossing on the breaking seas?

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.700
Needs must I like it well.

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.030
I weep for joy to stand upon my kingdom once again.

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.930
Dear earth,

9
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.270
I do salute thee with my hands,

10
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.630
though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs.

11
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.070
As a long-parted mother with her child

12
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.570
plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,

13
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.670
so weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,

14
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.830
and do thee favors with my royal hands.

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.230
Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,

16
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.370
nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense,

17
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.900
but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom

18
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.630
and heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,

19
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.930
doing annoyance to the treacherous feet

20
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.270
which with usurping steps do trample thee.

21
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.800
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies.

22
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.130
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,

23
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.170
guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder

24
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.970
whose double-tongue may with a mortal touch

25
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.800
throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.

26
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.730
Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords.

27
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.370
This earth shall have a feeling

28
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.270
and these stones prove armed soldiers

29
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.400
ere her native king shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.

30
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.500
Fear not, my lord.

31
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.670
That power that made you king

32
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.170
hath power to keep you king in spite of all.

33
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.870
The means that heaven yields must be embraced

34
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.370
and not neglected,

35
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.070
else, if heaven would, and we will not,

36
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.570
heaven's offer we refuse,

37
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.530
the proffered means of succor and redress.

38
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.270
He means, my lord, that we are too remiss

39
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.830
whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,

40
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.230
grows strong and great in substance and in power.

41
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.170
Discomfortable cousin.

42
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.400
Know'st thou not that when the searching eye of heaven

43
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.570
is hid behind the globe and lights the lower world,

44
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.170
then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen

45
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.230
in murders and in outrage, boldly here.

46
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.930
But when from under this terrestrial ball

47
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.170
he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines

48
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.970
and darts his light through every guilty hole,

49
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.900
then murders, treasons, and detested sins,

50
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.700
the cloak of night being plucked from off their backs,

51
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.900
stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?

52
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.570
So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,

53
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.730
who all this while hath reveled in the night

54
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.830
whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,

55
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.900
shall see us rising in our throne, the east.

56
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.370
His treasons will sit blushing on his face,

57
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.730
not able to endure the sight of day,

58
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.130
but self-affrighted tremble at his sin.

59
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.270
Not all the water in the rough, rude sea

60
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.230
can wash the balm off from an anointed king.

61
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.870
The breath of worldly men cannot depose

62
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.570
the deputy elected by the Lord.

63
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.930
For every man that Bolingbroke hath pressed

64
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.030
to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,

65
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.730
God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay a glorious angel.

66
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.300
Then, if angels fight,

67
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.900
weak men must fall,

68
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.670
for heaven still guards the right.

69
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.830
Welcome, my lord.

70
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.830
How far off lies your power?

71
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.170
Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,

72
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.200
than this weak arm.

73
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.770
Discomfort guides my tongue

74
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.470
and bids me speak of nothing but despair.

75
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.530
One day too late, I fear me, gracious Lord,

76
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.800
hath clouded all thy happy days on earth.

77
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.470
Oh, call back yesterday.

78
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.700
Bid time return,

79
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.400
and thou shalt have 12,000 fighting men.

80
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.000
Today, today-- unhappy day, too late--

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.530
o'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state.

82
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.800
For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead,

83
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.200
are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.

84
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.330
Comfort, my liege.

85
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.630
Why looks Your Grace so pale?

86
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.830
But now the blood of 20,000 men did triumph in my face,

87
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.100
and they are fled.

88
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.130
And till so much blood thither come again,

89
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.930
Have I not reason to look pale and dead?

90
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.830
All souls that will be safe fly from my side,

91
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.070
for time hath set a blot upon my pride.

92
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.100
Comfort, my liege.

93
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.170
Remember who you are.

94
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.970
I had forgot myself.

95
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.270
Am I not king?

96
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.130
Awake, thou coward majesty.

97
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.430
Thou sleepest.

98
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.230
Is not the king's name 20,000 names?

99
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.370
Arm, arm, my name.

100
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.270
A puny subject strikes at thy great glory.

101
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.830
Look not to the ground, ye favorites of a king.

102
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.270
Are we not high?

103
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.900
High be our thoughts.

104
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.630
I know my uncle York hath power enough to serve our turn.

105
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.830
But who comes here?

106
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.230
More health and happiness betide my liege

107
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.700
than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him.

108
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.600
Mine ear is open and my heart prepared.

109
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.770
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.

110
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.770
Say, is my kingdom lost?

111
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.170
Why, 'twas my care.

112
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.500
And what loss is it to be rid of care?

113
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.930
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?

114
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.930
Greater he shall not be.

115
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.230
If he serve God,

116
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.500
we'll serve Him, too, and be His fellow so.

117
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.670
Revolt our subjects?

118
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.800
That we cannot mend.

119
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.900
They break their faith to God as well as us.

120
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.900
Cry woe, destruction, ruin, and decay.

121
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.800
The worst is death, and death will have his day.

122
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.330
Glad am I that Your Highness

123
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.200
is so armed to bear the tidings of calamity.

124
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.430
Like an unseasonable stormy day

125
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.570
which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,

126
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.770
as if the world were all dissolved to tears,

127
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.800
so high above his limits swells the rage of Bolingbroke,

128
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.430
covering your fearful land

129
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.470
with hard, bright steel and hearts harder than steel.

130
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.830
Whitebeards have armed their thin and hairless scalps

131
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.370
against thy majesty.

132
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.100
Boys with women's voices strive to speak big

133
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.530
and clap their female joints

134
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.700
in stiff, unwieldy arms against thy crown.

135
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.630
Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows

136
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.000
of double-fatal yew against thy state.

137
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.900
Yea, distaff women manage rusty bills against thy seat.

138
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.600
Both young and old rebel,

139
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.430
and all goes worse than I have power to tell.

140
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.870
Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.

141
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.130
Where is the earl of Wiltshire?

142
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.200
Where is Bagot?

143
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.400
What is become of Bushy?

144
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.270
Where is Green,

145
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.570
that they have let the dangerous enemy

146
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.430
measure our confines with such peaceful steps?

147
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.630
If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it.

148
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.070
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.

149
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.230
Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.

150
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.470
Oh, villains!

151
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.600
Vipers damned without redemption!

152
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.230
Dogs easily won to fawn on any man.

153
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:55.200
Snakes, in my heart blood warmed, that sting my heart.

154
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.770
Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas.

155
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.770
Would they make peace?

156
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:01.970
Terrible hell make war

157
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.130
upon their spotted souls for this offence.

158
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.400
Sweet love, I see changing his property

159
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.900
turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.

160
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.070
Again uncurse their souls.

161
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.930
Their peace is made with heads and not with hands.

162
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.030
Those whom you curse

163
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.870
have felt the worst of death's destroying wound

164
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:26.900
and lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.

165
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.900
Is Bushy, Green, and the earl of Wiltshire dead?

166
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.400
Aye, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.

167
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.330
Where is the duke, my father, with his power?

168
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.700
No matter where.

169
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.870
Of comfort no man speak.

170
00:08:53.870 --> 00:09:01.200
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs.

171
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.070
Make dust our paper,

172
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:09.370
and with rainy eyes write sorrow on the bosom of the earth.

173
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:17.700
Let's choose executors and talk of wills.

174
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.770
And yet not so,

175
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.470
for what can we bequeath,

176
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:25.370
save our deposed bodies to the ground?

177
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:31.600
Our lands, our lives, and all are Bolingbroke's,

178
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.570
and nothing can we call our own but death

179
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.970
and that small model of the barren earth

180
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.600
which serves as paste and cover to our bones.

181
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:50.200
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground

182
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:56.130
and tell sad stories of the death of kings:

183
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.830
how some have been deposed,

184
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.870
some slain in war,

185
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:06.630
some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed,

186
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.870
some poisoned by their wives,

187
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:14.030
some sleeping killed.

188
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.670
All murdered.

189
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.100
For within the hollow crown

190
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.400
that rounds the mortal temples of a king

191
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.900
keeps death his court.

192
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.600
And there the antic sits,

193
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:36.030
scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,

194
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.800
allowing him a breath,

195
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:45.730
a little scene to monarchize, be feared, and kill with looks,

196
00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:51.100
infusing him with self and vain conceit,

197
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:58.000
as if this flesh which walls about our life

198
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.370
were brass impregnable,

199
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:09.500
and humored thus, comes at the last,

200
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:18.070
and with a little pin bores through his castle wall,

201
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.100
and farewell king.

202
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.100
Cover your heads

203
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.330
and mock not flesh and blood with solemn reverence.

204
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:42.870
Throw away respect, tradition, form, and ceremonious duty,

205
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:47.900
for you have but mistook me all this while.

206
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:52.970
I live with bread like you,

207
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.030
feel want,

208
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.870
taste grief,

209
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.500
need friends.

210
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.300
Subjected thus,

211
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:15.900
how can you say to me, I am a king?

212
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.300
My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,

213
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.730
but presently prevent the ways to wail.

214
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.070
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,

215
00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.300
gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,

216
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.830
and so your follies fight against yourself.

217
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.430
Fear and be slain.

218
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.900
No worse can come to fight.

219
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.200
And fight and die is death destroying death,

220
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.630
where fearing dying pays death servile breath.

221
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:45.900
My father hath a power.

222
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.900
Inquire of him and learn to make a body of a limb.

223
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.630
Thou chidest me well.

224
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.970
Proud Bolingbroke,

225
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:58.970
I come to change blows with thee for our day of doom.

226
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.900
This ague fit of fear is overblown.

227
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.000
An easy task it is to win our own.

228
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.770
Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?

229
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.170
Speak sweetly, man,

230
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.730
although thy looks be sour.

231
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.100
Men judge by the complexion of the sky

232
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.530
the state and inclination of the day,

233
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.170
and so may you by my dull and heavy eye.

234
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:24.030
My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.

235
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.230
I play the torturer,

236
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.270
by small and small

237
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.930
to lengthen out the worst that must be spoken.

238
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.400
Your uncle York is joined with Bolingbroke--

239
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.900
and all your northern castles yielded up,

240
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:44.470
and all your southern gentlemen in arms upon his party.

241
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:48.300
Thou hast said enough.

242
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.300
Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth

243
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.570
of that sweet way I was in to despair.

244
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.970
What say you now?

245
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:04.670
What comfort have we now?

246
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.400
By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly

247
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.370
that bids me be of comfort anymore.

248
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.000
Go to Flint Castle.

249
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.970
There I'll pine away.

250
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:21.500
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.

251
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.700
That power I have, discharge,

252
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.270
and let them go to ear the land that hath some hope to grow,

253
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.070
for I have none.

254
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.730
Let no man speak again to alter this,

255
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:35.900
for counsel is but vain.

256
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.900
My liege, one word--

257
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.200
He does me double wrong

258
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.130
that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.

259
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.530
Discharge my followers!

260
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:49.000
Let them hence away

261
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.130
from Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.

262
00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.170
intelligence

263
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.330
we learn the Welshmen are dispersed

264
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.130
and Salisbury is gone to meet the king,

265
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:14.070
who lately landed with some few private friends upon this coast.

266
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.100
The news is very fair and good, my lord.

267
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.230
Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.

268
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.970
It would beseem the lord Northumberland

269
00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.830
to say "King Richard."

270
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.130
Alack the heavy day

271
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.200
when such a sacred king should hide his head.

272
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.430
Your Grace mistakes.

273
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.100
Only to be brief left I his title out.

274
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.330
The time hath been,

275
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.570
would you have been so brief with him,

276
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.900
he would have been so brief with you, to shorten you,

277
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.570
for taking so the head, your whole head's length.

278
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.270
Mistake not, Uncle, further than you should--

279
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:51.570
Take not, good cousin, further than you should,

280
00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.730
lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.

281
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:58.470
I know it, Uncle, and oppose not myself against their will.

282
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.230
But who comes here?

283
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:02.800
Welcome, Harry.

284
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.770
What, will not this castle yield?

285
00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:08.270
The castle royally is manned, my lord, against thy entrance.

286
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.430
Royally?

287
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:13.070
Why, it contains no king?

288
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.300
Yes, my good lord, it doth contain a king.

289
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.030
King Richard lies within the limits of yon lime and stone,

290
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.830
and with him are the lord Aumerle,

291
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.170
Lord Salisbury, Sir Stephen Scroop,

292
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.000
besides a clergyman of holy reverence--

293
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.030
who, I cannot learn.

294
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.200
Oh, belike it is the bishop of Carlisle.

295
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:37.730
Noble lord, go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle.

296
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.400
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parle

297
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.930
into his ruined ears, and thus deliver:

298
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.570
Henry Bolingbroke, on both his knees,

299
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.530
doth kiss King Richard's hand

300
00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.200
and sends allegiance and true faith of heart

301
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.170
to his most royal person,

302
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:59.670
hither come even at his feet to lay my arms and power,

303
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.130
provided that my banishment repealed

304
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.370
and lands restored again be freely granted.

305
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.970
If not, I'll use the advantage of my power

306
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:14.670
and lay the summer's dust with showers of blood

307
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.430
rained from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen.

308
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:22.130
The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke it is,

309
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.630
such crimson tempest should bedrench

310
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:28.300
the fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,

311
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.970
my stooping duty tenderly shall show.

312
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.070
Go.

313
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.670
Signify as much,

314
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:39.170
while here we march upon the grassy carpet of this plain.

315
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:46.700
Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,

316
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.170
that from this castle's tattered battlements

317
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.270
our fair appointments may be well perused.

318
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.770
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet

319
00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.730
with no less terror

320
00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.300
than the elements of fire and water,

321
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.470
when their thundering shock at meeting

322
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.570
tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.

323
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.330
Be he the fire.

324
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.300
I'll be the yielding water.

325
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.130
The rage be his,

326
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:17.570
whilst on the earth I rain my waters--

327
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.930
on the earth, and not on him.

328
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:27.070
March on,

329
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.900
and mark King Richard how he looks.

330
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.600
See; see.

331
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.400
King Richard doth himself appear,

332
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.030
as doth the blushing, discontented sun

333
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.030
from out the fiery portal of the east,

334
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.170
when he perceives the envious clouds are bent

335
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.270
to dim his glory and to stain the track

336
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.270
of his bright passage to the occident.

337
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.600
Yet looks he like a king.

338
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.430
Behold his eye, as bright as is the eagle's,

339
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:05.370
lightens forth controlling majesty.

340
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.530
Alack, alack, for woe,

341
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.670
that any harm should stain so fair a show.

342
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.370
We are amazed

343
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.900
and thus long have we stood

344
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.600
to watch the fearful bending of thy knee,

345
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.770
because we thought ourself thy lawful king.

346
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.870
And if we be,

347
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:28.870
how dare thy joints forget

348
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:32.700
to pay their awful duty to our presence?

349
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.430
If we be not, show us the hand of God

350
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.630
that hath dismissed us from our stewardship,

351
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:43.700
for well we know, no hand of blood and bone

352
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.470
can gripe the sacred handle of our scepter

353
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:51.200
unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.

354
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.670
And though you think that all, as you have done,

355
00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:59.000
have torn their souls by turning them from us,

356
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.230
and we are barren and bereft of friends,

357
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:06.470
yet know, my master, God omnipotent,

358
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.500
is mustering in his clouds, on our behalf,

359
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.170
armies of pestilence,

360
00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:17.970
and they shall strike your children yet unborn and unbegot

361
00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:21.030
that lift your vassal hands against my head

362
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:25.670
and threat the glory of my precious crown.

363
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:32.530
Tell Bolingbroke-- for yond methinks he stands--

364
00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:39.300
that every stride he makes upon my land is dangerous treason.

365
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:43.400
He is come to open the purple testament of bleeding war.

366
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:47.330
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,

367
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:50.830
10,000 bloody crowns of mothers' sons

368
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:54.330
shall ill become the flower of England's face,

369
00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.800
change the complexion of her maid-pale peace

370
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.970
to scarlet indignation

371
00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:03.970
and bedew her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.

372
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:07.830
The king of heaven forbid our lord the king

373
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:13.470
should so with civil and uncivil arms be rushed upon.

374
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.270
Thy thrice noble cousin, Harry Bolingbroke,

375
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:24.370
doth humbly kiss thy hand.

376
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:27.200
And by the honorable tomb he swears,

377
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.430
that stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,

378
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.570
and by the royalties of both your bloods,

379
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:39.400
currents that spring from one most gracious head,

380
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.530
and by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,

381
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:46.530
and by the worth and honor of himself,

382
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:50.600
comprising all that may be sworn or said,

383
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.000
his coming hither hath no further scope

384
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.300
than for his lineal royalties

385
00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:03.600
and to beg enfranchisement immediate on his knees,

386
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.030
which on thy royal party granted once,

387
00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.900
his glittering arms he will commend to rust,

388
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.000
his barbed steeds to stables,

389
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.030
and his heart to faithful service of Your Majesty.

390
00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:26.430
This swears he, as he is a prince, is just.

391
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:32.400
And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.

392
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:39.330
Northumberland, say thus the king returns:

393
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:46.400
his noble cousin is right welcome hither

394
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.430
and all the number of his fair demands

395
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:54.670
shall be accomplished without contradiction.

396
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:59.630
With all the gracious utterance that thou hast,

397
00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:04.000
speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.

398
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.670
We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,

399
00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:14.530
to look so poorly and to speak so fair?

400
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.830
Shall we call back Northumberland

401
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:18.500
and send defiance to the traitor, and so die?

402
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.630
No, good my lord.

403
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.100
Let's fight with gentle words

404
00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.570
till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.

405
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.770
Oh, God.

406
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.300
Oh, God, that e'er this tongue of mine

407
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.970
that laid the sentence of dread banishment on yon proud man

408
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:37.070
should take it off again with words of sooth.

409
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:41.300
Oh, that I were as great as is my grief

410
00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.130
or lesser than my name,

411
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:47.200
or that I could forget what I have been

412
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.970
or not remember what I must be now.

413
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.870
Swell'st thou, proud heart?

414
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.070
I'll give thee scope to beat,

415
00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:00.700
since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.

416
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.730
Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.

417
00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:06.570
What must the king do now?

418
00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:08.970
Must he submit?

419
00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.400
The king shall do it.

420
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.630
Must he be deposed?

421
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.100
The king shall be contented.

422
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.830
Must he lose the name of king?

423
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.730
O' God's name, let it go.

424
00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:33.400
I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,

425
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.630
my gorgeous palace for a hermitage,

426
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:40.670
my gay apparel for an almsman's gown,

427
00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:44.070
my figured goblets for a dish of wood,

428
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:47.500
my scepter for a palmer's walking staff,

429
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.700
my subjects for a pair of carved saints,

430
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:57.230
and my large kingdom for a little grave--

431
00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:00.300
a little, little grave.

432
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:05.000
An obscure grave.

433
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,

434
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.970
some way of common trade,

435
00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:11.270
where subjects' feet

436
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.400
may hourly trample on their sovereign's head;

437
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.670
for on my heart they tread now whilst I live,

438
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.600
and buried once, why not upon my head?

439
00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.900
Aumerle, thou weep'st.

440
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.100
My tenderhearted cousin,

441
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.770
we'll make foul weather with despised tears.

442
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:38.530
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn

443
00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.830
and make a dearth in this revolting land.

444
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:47.900
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes

445
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.970
and make some pretty match with shedding tears,

446
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:56.930
as thus to drop them still upon one place

447
00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:01.100
till they have fretted us a pair of graves within the earth

448
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.830
and, therein laid--

449
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.030
there lies two kinsmen.

450
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.500
Dig their graves with weeping eyes.

451
00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.430
Would not this ill do well?

452
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.000
Well,

453
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.430
well, I see I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.

454
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:34.670
Most mighty prince, my lord Northumberland,

455
00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.830
what says King Bolingbroke?

456
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:42.370
Will His Majesty give Richard leave to live till Richard die?

457
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:48.470
You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says aye.

458
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:51.530
My lord, he doth attend in the base court to speak with you.

459
00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:54.070
May it please you to come down.

460
00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:58.600
Down.

461
00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.170
Down I come,

462
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.830
like glistering Phaethon

463
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:08.900
wanting the manage of unruly jades.

464
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.630
In the base court?

465
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:15.830
Base court, where kings grow base,

466
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.870
to come at traitors' calls and do them grace.

467
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.470
In the base court?

468
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:21.730
Come down?

469
00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:23.330
Down, court;

470
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:24.970
down, king;

471
00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:29.730
for night owls shriek where mounting larks should sing.

472
00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.500
What says His Majesty?

473
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.300
Sorrow and grief of heart make him speak fondly,

474
00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.170
like a frantic man yet he is come.

475
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.870
Stand all apart and show fair duty to His Majesty.

476
00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:53.770
My gracious lord.

477
00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:56.530
Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee

478
00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:59.270
to make the base earth proud with kissing it.

479
00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.930
Me rather had my heart might feel your love

480
00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:05.630
than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.

481
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:09.130
Up, cousin, up.

482
00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:13.030
Your heart is up, I know, thus high at least,

483
00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:16.330
although your knee be low.

484
00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:19.400
My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.

485
00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:24.670
Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.

486
00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:27.830
So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,

487
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.230
as my true service shall deserve your love.

488
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:34.030
Well you deserve.

489
00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:35.530
They well deserve to have

490
00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:38.500
that know the strongest and surest way to get.

491
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:46.200
Uncle, give me your hands.

492
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.070
Nay, dry your eyes.

493
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.870
Tears show their loves, but want their remedies.

494
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.830
Cousin, I am too young to be your father,

495
00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:00.100
though you are old enough to be my heir.

496
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.500
What you will have, I'll give, and willing too,

497
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.900
for do we must what force will have us do.

498
00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.630
Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?

499
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.400
Yea, my good lord.

500
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.670
Then I must not say no.

501
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:31.800
What sport shall we devise here in this garden,

502
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.430
to drive away the heavy thought of care?

503
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:37.000
Madam, we'll play at bowls.

504
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.730
'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,

505
00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:42.630
and that my fortune runs against the bias.

506
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.100
Madam, we'll dance.

507
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.700
My legs can keep no measure in delight

508
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.330
when my poor heart no measure keeps in grief.

509
00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.870
Therefore, no dancing, girl.

510
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:56.170
Some other sport.

511
00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:59.100
Madam, we'll tell tales.

512
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.530
Of sorrow or of joy?

513
00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:02.970
Of either, madam.

514
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:04.930
Of neither, girl.

515
00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.930
For if of joy, being altogether wanting,

516
00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.500
it doth remember me the more of sorrow;

517
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.800
or if of grief, being altogether had,

518
00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.270
it adds more sorrow to my want of joy.

519
00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:20.930
For what I have I need not to repeat,

520
00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:23.400
and what I want it boots not to complain.

521
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.370
Madam, I'll sing.

522
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:29.970
'Tis well that thou hast cause,

523
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:33.700
but thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep.

524
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:38.300
I could weep, madam, would it do you good.

525
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:42.170
And I could sing, would weeping do me good,

526
00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.400
and never borrow any tear of thee.

527
00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.800
Here come the gardeners.

528
00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.430
Let's step into the shadow of these trees.

529
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.770
My wretchedness unto a row of pins

530
00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:54.800
they'll talk of state,

531
00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.000
for everyone doth so against a change.

532
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.370
Woe is forerun with woe.

533
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:05.070
Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,

534
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:06.900
which, like unruly children,

535
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.830
make their sire stoop with oppression

536
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.200
of their prodigal weight.

537
00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:16.570
Give some supportance to the bending twigs.

538
00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:20.200
Go thou and, like an executioner,

539
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.200
cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays

540
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.170
that look too lofty in our commonwealth.

541
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:29.100
All must be even in our government.

542
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.170
You thus employed,

543
00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.970
I will go root away the noisome weeds,

544
00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.730
which without profit suck the soil's fertility

545
00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:38.470
from the wholesome flowers.

546
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:41.630
Why should we, in the compass of a pale,

547
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:45.030
keep law and form and due proportion,

548
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.900
showing, as in a model, our firm estate,

549
00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.370
when our sea-walled garden, the whole land,

550
00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.130
is full of weeds,

551
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:54.200
her fairest flowers choked up,

552
00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.400
her fruit trees all unpruned,

553
00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.030
her hedges ruined, her knots disordered,

554
00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.630
and her wholesome herbs swarming with caterpillars?

555
00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.130
Hold thy peace.

556
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:06.900
He who that hath suffered this disordered spring

557
00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.930
hath now himself met with the fall of leaf.

558
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.730
The weeds which his broad, spreading leaves did shelter,

559
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:16.270
that seemed in eating him to hold him up,

560
00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:19.700
are plucked up root and all by Bolingbroke--

561
00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:24.030
I mean the earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.

562
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:25.770
What, are they dead?

563
00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:28.970
They are, and Bolingbroke hath seized the wasteful king.

564
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:34.000
Oh, I am pressed to death through want of speaking.

565
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.270
Thou, old Adam's likeness,

566
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.230
set to dress this garden,

567
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:42.170
how dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?

568
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:45.000
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee

569
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.430
to make a second fall of cursed man?

570
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.170
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?

571
00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:51.200
Darest thou,

572
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.600
thou little better thing than earth,

573
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.800
divine his downfall?

574
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:59.130
Say, where, when, and how camest thou by this ill tidings?

575
00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.130
Speak, thou wretch.

576
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:02.130
Pardon me, madam.

577
00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:03.870
Little joy have I to breathe this news.

578
00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:06.330
Yet what I say is true.

579
00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:10.270
King Richard, he is in the mighty hold of Bolingbroke.

580
00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:16.070
Their fortunes both are weighed.

581
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.600
In your lord's scale is nothing but himself

582
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.400
and some few vanities that make him light.

583
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.130
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,

584
00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:25.900
besides himself, are all the English peers.

585
00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.500
And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.

586
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.100
Post you to London, and you will find it so.

587
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.830
I speak no more than everyone doth know.

588
00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:45.130
Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,

589
00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:48.200
does not thy embassage belong to me,

590
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.730
and am I the last that knows it?

591
00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:55.570
Oh, thou think'st to serve me last

592
00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:59.870
that I may longest keep thy sorrow in my breast.

593
00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:06.270
Come, ladies, go,

594
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:11.130
to meet at London London's king in woe.

595
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.300
What, was I born to this,

596
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.530
that my sad look

597
00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:23.100
should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?

598
00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:29.370
Gardener, for telling me this news of woe,

599
00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:33.270
pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.

600
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:43.470
