00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
THE LITERATURE OF THE
AMERICAN CONTINENT

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
REACHES BACK LONG
BEFORE THE ARRIVAL

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
IN FACT, IT WAS ALREADY
WELL ESTABLISHED BEFORE

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
"AMERICA" EVEN EXISTED IN
THE EUROPEAN IMAGINATION;

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
BACK IN A TIME WHEN YOU
COULD HEAR TALES OF THE

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
MYTHICAL AZTLAN OR OF
THE MIGHTY TAHUANTINSUYU.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
IN THOSE DAYS MILLIONS OF
INHABITANTS FROM DIFFERENT

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
PARTS OF THE CONTINENT
RECALLED GLORIOUS EVENTS

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
OF THE PAST, WORSHIPED
THEIR GODS, HONORED THEIR

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
RULERS AND LIVED
THEIR DAY TO DAY LIVES

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
IN A WORLD SUFFUSED WITH
SONGS, POEMS, ORAL EPICS,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
DRAMAS, AND LEGENDS.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
EACH TRIBE KEPT IN
ITS SHARED MEMORY

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
THE TALES OF
PAST TRIUMPHS

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
AND THE PROPHECIES
OF THE TIMES TO COME,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
WEAVING A DAZZLING TAPESTRY
OF ANCESTRAL VOICES,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
PRIESTLY WISDOM,
POPULAR LEGENDS,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
TOGETHER WITH
DANCES AND PLAYS.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
THIS WEB OF STORY AND
RITUAL SERVED AS THE

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
CULTURAL TOUCHPOINT FOR
TRIBAL CIVILIZATIONS

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAS.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
AND SO IT WAS THAT
THE NATIVE PEOPLES

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
WENT ON CREATING A
COLLECTIVE MEMORY

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
AND CULTURAL IDENTITY THAT
WAS FOREVER SHATTERED

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
BY THE ARRIVAL OF THE
"MEN OF CASTILLA".

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:58.000
*

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:08.000
*

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
*

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND
PRE-HISPANIC LITERATURE

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
IT'S IMPORTANT TO
UNDERSTAND THAT

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
IT IS A LIVING, DYNAMIC
ART FORM THAT TOUCHES

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
ALL OTHER ASPECTS
OF INDIGENOUS LIFE.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
THIS ART CAN ENCOMPASS
DRAMAS, SONGS, POEMS,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
DANCES, NARRATIVES
AND DISCOURSES.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
THESE FORMS CAN PRESENT
MYTH, HISTORY, POLITICS,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
AND DISCUSS THE ULTIMATE
CONCERNS THAT HAVE

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
PREOCCUPIED HUMANITY
EVERYWHERE - LIFE, LOVE,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
DEATH, AND THE INEXORABLE
PASSAGE OF TIME.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
ALTHOUGH PRE-HISPANIC
LITERARY TEXTS CAN BE

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
TRACED BACK MILLENNIA TO
THE CONTINENT'S EARLIEST

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
CIVILIZATIONS, THEIR
EVANESCENT NATURE MAKES IT

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
POSSIBLE FOR US TO REACH
ONLY A FEW OF THEM.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
THEY ARE PREDOMINANTLY
ORAL WORKS PASSED DOWN

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
FROM GENERATION TO
GENERATION; TALES, SONGS

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
AND DISCOURSES THAT
DEPENDED ON A COMMUNITY

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
TO BRING THEM TO LIFE
AT EACH PRESENTATION.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
BUT THE THREAD WAS BROKEN
WITH THE SPANISH CONQUEST.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
THE FEW BOOKS THAT EXISTED
IN THE FORM OF CODICES

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
OR QUIPUS WERE DESTROYED,
AS WERE THE TEMPLES

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
AND MANY OF THE
INSCRIPTIONS THEY BORE.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
IN THE ANDEAN
REGION, THE QUIPUS

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
- A REMARKABLE
SYSTEM OF KNOTTED

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
MULTI-COLORED STRINGS
USED FOR COMMUNICATION

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
- WERE BURNED, AND
THE WISE MEN, PRIESTS,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
AND LEADERS WHO KNEW
HOW TO READ THEM

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
WERE HOUNDED TO
NEAR EXTINCTION.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
DESPITE THIS SYSTEMATIC
AND MERCILESS OPPRESSION,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
AND THANKS TO THE WILL
OF MANY TO HOLD ON TO

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
THE ESSENCE OF THEIR
CULTURE AND THEIR PAST,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
A FRACTION OF THESE TEXTS
HAS MANAGED TO SURVIVE.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
THEY SERVE
AS THE BASIS

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
FOR AN ONGOING
LITERARY TRADITION.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
THE SOURCES FOR THESE
NATIVE TEXTS ARE MANY

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
AND ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT
THE ENTIRE CONTINENT.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
MESO-AMERICAN WORKS
SURVIVED DUE IN PART TO

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
AN INCIPIENT WRITING
SYSTEM THAT AROSE IN THE

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
ZAPOTECA REGION
- CURRENTLY MONTE ALBAN -

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
AND IN THE MAYA REGION.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
IN ADDITION TO THESE TEXTS
THERE ARE MANUSCRIPTS

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.000
THAT WERE WRITTEN IN NATIVE
LANGUAGES OR HISPANICIZED.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
THEY ARE THE FAMOUS BOOKS
OF THE CHILAM BALAM.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
THEY COME FROM VARIOUS
PLACES: CHILAM BALAM

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
FROM CHUMAYEL - IT DEPENDS
ON WHERE THEY WERE FOUND.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
MANY OF THOSE HAVE
BEEN PRESERVED,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
THE FAMOUS POPOL VUH.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
THEY ARE ALL BOOKS THAT CAME
FROM PRE-HISPANIC CODICES

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
AND WERE TRANSCRIBED
TO ALPHABET WRITING.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
IN CENTRAL MEXICO
THAT HAPPENED LESS,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
THE PRE-HISPANIC SYSTEM
WAS MAINTAINED.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
WHY? BECAUSE THE
EMPIRE WAS SURGING,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
IT WAS A
GREAT EMPIRE,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
AND WHAT WE ALSO
DID IN CENTRAL AMERICA,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
THAT WAS ALREADY HAPPENING
IN THE PRE-HISPANIC TIMES

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
IS WE HAD AN OFFICIAL
LANGUAGE OF THE EMPIRE,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
WHICH WAS THE NAHUATL,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
AND MANY CODICES WERE
WRITTEN IN NAHUATL.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
MANY OF THESE WORKS WERE
COLLECTED IN THE SIXTEENTH

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES
BY FRIARS WHO WERE EAGER

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME WERE

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
FASCINATED BY THE
CULTURAL RICHNESS

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
OF THE NATIVE PEOPLES.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
INDIGENOUS TEXTS HAVE ALSO
BEEN SUMMARIZED, COPIED,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
AND REFERENCED BY NATIVE
OR MIXED-RACE HISTORIANS

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
SUCH AS ALVA IXTLILXOCHITL
AND ALVARADO TEZOZOMOC

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
IN MEXICO; THE INCA
GARCILAZO DE LA VEGA

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
AND GUAMAN POMA DE AYALA IN
PERU, AND SEVERAL SPANIARDS:

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
THE HISTORIAN FRANCISCO
LOPEZ DE GOMARA,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
THE SOLDIER BERNAL
DIAZ, AND THE FRIARS

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
ANDRES DE OLMOS,
BERNARDINO DE SAHAGUN,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
AS WELL AS THE MONK
JUAN DE TORQUEMADA.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
THERE'S AN INTEREST
OF OFFICIALS,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
OF ROYAL OFFICIALS OF THE
SPANISH CROWN AND FRIARS,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
TO KNOW MORE ABOUT
THE PRE-HISPANIC PAST.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
THE REASONS WERE
VERY PRACTICAL -

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
TO COLLECT TRIBUTES AND
HOW THEY WERE COLLECTED,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
WHO COLLECTED THEM, AND
HOW THEY WERE GIVEN OUT

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
- BASIC THINGS
LIKE THESE.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
LAND BORDER PROBLEMS
- TWO TOWNS WOULD

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
GO TO COURT, FIGHTING,
AND THEY WOULD

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
HAVE TO DECIDE WHO
THE LAND BELONGED TO.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
THEY WOULD SHOW CODICES AS
PROOF OF THEIR ARGUMENT.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
IT'S NECESSARY TO
KNOW HOW IT WORKS.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
FRIARS DEDICATED TO
EVANGELIZATION NEEDED TO

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000
KNOW ABOUT THE OLD CUSTOMS
TO MODIFY, ERADICATE THEM.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
OVERLOOKED FOR MUCH OF
POST-COLONIAL HISTORY,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
THESE WORKS WERE
REDISCOVERED AT THE

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH
CENTURY BY HISTORIANS,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
ANTHROPOLOGISTS,
AND ETHNOGRAPHERS.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
ADMIRED FOR THEIR
AESTHETIC BEAUTY AND

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
THEIR INSIGHT INTO
THE HUMAN CONDITION,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
THESE COMPOSITIONS
HAVE BECOME CENTRAL

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
TO LATIN AMERICAN
IDENTITY.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
THE PROCESS OF
INTERPRETING THESE

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
MATERIALS IS
IN GOOD HEALTH

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
AND IS BEING
DONE AS WE SPEAK.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
MANY THINGS STILL NEED TO
BE DONE - DOCUMENTS LEFT

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
TO BE PUBLISHED, TO GET
TO KNOW, TO BE STUDIED IN

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
THEIR HISTORICAL CONTEXT,
NOT SEPARATE FROM IT.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
A LOT HAS ADVANCED
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
NECESSITY OF CONTEXT,
AS A FUNDAMENTAL

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
METHODOLOGICAL RESOURCE
TO UNDERSTAND THEM.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
THESE TEXTS WERE
ORIGINALLY COMPOSED IN THE

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
VARIOUS NATIVE LANGUAGES
OF THE CONTINENT.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
MANY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
PIECES WERE WRITTEN IN

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
NAHUATL, THE LINGUA FRANCA
OF THE MEXICAN EMPIRE

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
BEFORE THE ARRIVAL
OF THE SPANIARDS.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
THEY WERE ALSO COMPOSED
IN THE MAYAN FAMILY

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
OF LANGUAGES - YUCATECAN,
QUICHE, TZOTZIL, AND

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
TZELTAL - AND IN AYMARA,
GUARANI, AND QUECHUAN.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
MANY WORKS WERE TRANSLATED
INTO SPANISH, SUMMARIZED,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
AND INTERPRETED BY
FRIARS AND SCRIBES.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
AS A RESULT, IT'S OFTEN
DIFFICULT TO RECONSTRUCT

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
THE PATTERNS OF NATIVE SPEECH
IN SUBSEQUENT VERSIONS.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
HOWEVER, IN MANY OF THE
TEXTS AVAILABLE TODAY

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
WE CAN STILL HEAR THE DISTANT
ECHOES OF MUSICALITY,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
THE LINGERING
SOUNDS OF A PAST

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000
THAT IS STILL ALIVE
IN MANY COMMUNITIES.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
THE MESO-AMERICAN TERRITORY
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
REGIONS TO FEEL THE YOKE
OF SPANISH CONQUEST,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
COMING ONLY SOME TWENTY
YEARS AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
COLUMBUS AT THE WESTERN
COAST OF GUANAHANI.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
BECAUSE OF ITS COMPLEX
AND FASCINATING TRIBAL

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
HISTORY, MESO-AMERICA IS A
TREASURE TROVE OF TALES,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
MYTHS, AND SONGS - MANY
OF WHICH CAN BE FOUND ON

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
STONE INSCRIPTIONS
AND MONUMENTS.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
IN FACT, ONE OF THE
MOST ANCIENT FORMS OF

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
MESO-AMERICAN WRITING CAN
BE FOUND AT MOUNT ALBAN,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
IN THE STATE OF OAXACA.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
THIS SERIES OF DRAWINGS
AND INSCRIPTIONS

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
IS KNOWN AS "LOS
DANZANTES" - THE DANCERS

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
- ALTHOUGH THE
FIGURES ARE TODAY

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
BELIEVED TO BE
SACRIFICED PRISONERS.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
IN ADDITION TO THESE
IMAGES AND INSCRIPTIONS,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
THERE WERE TEXTS
COMPOSED ON AMATE PAPER

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
OR DEER SKIN BY
SCRIBES AND PRIESTS

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
KNOWN AS "CODICES".

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
WE MUST SAY THAT
THE WORD "CODICES"

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
IS NOT A WORD THAT BELONGS
OR DESCRIBES THEM.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
AND WHAT WE CALLED CODICES
BELONGED TO THE MAYAN

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
CULTURE AND AZTEC CULTURE
IN GENERAL, AND THEY ARE

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
BOOKS - IN WESTERN TERMS
THEY ARE CONSIDERED BOOKS

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
WHICH WERE MADE FROM THE
BARK OF TREES CALLED AMATL.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
THEY WOULD STICK THEM
TOGETHER FORMING THE

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
FLAT PART AND THEY
WOULD HAVE A PROCESS

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
TO MAKE THE
EQUIVALENT OF PAGES.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
THEN THEY WOULD COVER
THEM WITH WHITEWASH

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
TO CREATE A SURFACE
THAT THEY COULD DRAW ON.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
MANY OF THE CODICES WERE
DISCOURSES ON THE GODS,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
ASTRONOMY, OR ON THE
ANCIENT ART OF CHRONICLING

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
THE PASSAGE OF TIME
WITH CALENDARS -

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
A SKILL AT WHICH THE
MAYANS IN PARTICULAR

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
FAR SURPASSED THEIR
EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.000
THE NAMES OF THEIR MONTHS ARE
RELATED TO CERTAIN NATURAL

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000
PHENOMENA OR EVERYDAY LIFE,
BASED ON AGRICULTURE.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
FOR EXAMPLE, ATLCAHUALO,
THE LOWERING,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
WATER GOING DOWN, RELATED
TO WHEN WATER DESCENDS.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
OR TLAXOCHIMACO, THE
OFFERING OF FLOWERS,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
MEANING THERE
ARE FLOWERS.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
OR IN THE CASE
OF ETSACALIZQUI,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
THE EATING OF
CORN AND BEANS,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
MEANING THE MOMENT OF HAVING
CORN AND BEANS TO EAT.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
THEY ARE INTERESTING
SIGNS OF THE CALENDAR

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
THAT ALLOW US TO
CREATE A LINK BETWEEN

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000
FESTIVITIES AND THE
AGRICULTURAL YEAR.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
IT'S BASICALLY A
CALENDAR TO ESTABLISH

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
AND UNDERSTAND THE
CYCLES OF THE STARS.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
BECAUSE IN THE
MESO-AMERICAN WORLD

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
STARS ARE NOT THINGS,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
THEY ARE BEINGS WITH
A WILL OF THEIR OWN.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
THEY ARE BEINGS WITH
PERSONALITY, THEY ARE GODS.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
SO THE CALENDARS ALLOW,
AMONG OTHER THINGS,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
ESTABLISHING CONTACT.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
THE FACT IS THAT
MESO-AMERICANS WERE QUITE

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
ADEPT AT WRITING IN ITS
MOST ELEMENTARY FORM,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
THE PICTOGRAM.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
MOREOVER, MANY INHABITANTS,
ESPECIALLY THE MAYANS,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
HAD MORE DEVELOPED
SYSTEMS OF WRITING

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.000
THAT USED IDEOGRAMS
AND PHONETIC SYMBOLS.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
IN MESO-AMERICA THE TYPE
OF WRITING THEY HAD,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
UNLIKE OURS, WAS
HIEROGLYPHICS.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
ITS SCIENTIFIC NAME IS
LOGOSYLLABIC, MEANING

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
IT'S NOT ALPHABETIC, IT
DOESN'T HAVE LETTERS,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
IT HAS A SERIES
OF SYMBOLS.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
THESE SYMBOLS CAN
BE UNDERSTOOD AS

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
WHOLE WORDS
OR LOGOGRAMS

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
OR SYLLABLES, WHICH
ARE PHONETIC SYMBOLS.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
AND THESE COMBINED
ARE HOW THEY WRITE.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
CODICES WERE OFTEN
ACCOMPANIED BY LONG

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
ORAL SET PIECES THAT
WOULD BE MEMORIZED

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
BY YOUNG APPRENTICES
AT SCHOOLS.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
THESE WERE CALLED
CALMECACS AND WERE

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
KEPT IN LIBRARIES
KNOWN AS AMOXCALLI.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
IN THE MEXICAN
SONG MANUSCRIPT,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
AN AUTHOR RUMINATES ABOUT
THE NATURE OF HIS WORK:

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I SING THE WORDS OF THE
BOOK AS I SPREAD THEM

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I AM LIKE A
COLORFUL PARROT,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I MAKE THESE
CODICES SPEAK UP

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
INSIDE THE HOUSES
OF PAINTINGS.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
RICH WITH METAPHORS AND
IMAGES OF GREAT BEAUTY,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
THESE COMPOSITIONS
WERE DIVIDED INTO

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
CUICATL - SONGS
AND POEMS,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
AND TLAOLLI - STORIES
AND DISCOURSES.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
MANY OF THEM
ARE ANONYMOUS

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
OR WRITTEN BY
UNKNOWN AUTHORS.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
THEY HAVE BEEN PASSED DOWN
THROUGH THE GENERATIONS

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
BY MEANS OF MEMORIZATION
AND REPETITION.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
BUT THERE ARE ALSO
COMPOSITIONS WRITTEN BY

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
OVER THIRTY
WELL-KNOWN AUTHORS;

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
THE MOST FAMOUS OF THESE
BEING NEZAHUALCOYOTL,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
RULER OF TEZCOCO
IN CENTRAL MEXICO.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
THE CUICATL ARE
RHYTHMIC COMPOSITIONS

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
THAT WERE OFTEN
ACCOMPANIED BY MUSIC.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
THEY SERVED AS SACRED
HYMNS TO BE SUNG AT

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
RELIGIOUS FESTIVITIES,
AND AS WAR SONGS.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
THEY RECOUNTED STORIES
OF FAMOUS LEADERS,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
OF WELL-KNOWN VICTORIES
OVER FEARSOME ENEMIES.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
AND THEY EXALTED THE PEOPLE'S
HISTORY AND THEIR CITY.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
FULL OF PRIDE, THE CITY OF
 MEXICO-TENOCHTITLAN RISES;

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
HERE, NO ONE FEARS
 DYING AT WAR.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
THIS IS OUR GLORY.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
THIS IS YOUR INSTRUCTION
 OH, GIVER OF LIFE!

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
BEAR IT IN MIND, OH
 PRINCES; DO NOT FORGET.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
WHO COULD SIEGE
 TENOCHTITLAN?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
WHO COULD MOVE THE
 HEAVENLY FOUNDATIONS?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
THERE ARE ALSO SONGS
OF FLOWERS, OF SPRING,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
STORIES OF LOVE AND
OF GRIEF THAT MEDIATE

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
THE PRIMAL THEMES
OF LIFE AND DEATH.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
AM I TO GO WITH THE
 FLOWERS THAT PERISHED?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
WILL NOTHING BE
 LEFT OF MY NAME?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
NONE OF MY FAME
 HERE ON EARTH?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
AT LEAST MY FLOWERS!

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
AT LEAST MY SONGS!

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
HERE ON EARTH IS THE PLACE
 OF THE EVANESCENT MOMENT.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
IS THIS WHAT
 IT IS ALSO LIKE

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
WHERE SOMEHOW
 THERE IS LIFE?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
IS THERE ANY JOY,
 ANY FRIENDSHIP?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
OR IS IT ONLY
 HERE ON EARTH

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
THAT WE HAVE COME
 TO SEE OUR FACES?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
OTHER NAHUA COMPOSITIONS
INCLUDE THE TLATOLLI -

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
THE "SPEAKINGS",
WHICH INCLUDE TALES,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
STORIES AND
OTHER DISCOURSES.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
AMONG THESE ARE THE
HUEHUETLATOLLI -

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
LITERALLY, THE WORDS
OF WISDOM OR AGE.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
MANY OF THESE WERE
COLLECTED TOGETHER

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
BY FRIAR ANDRES DE OLMOS
IN AROUND THE YEAR 1530.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
THESE WORDS WOULD HAVE
BEEN HEARD ON SPECIAL

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
OCCASIONS, SUCH AS THE
DEATH OF A TRIBAL LEADER,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
A WEDDING, A BIRTH,
OR A PUBLIC CEREMONY.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
THROUGH THEM IT IS
POSSIBLE TO GLIMPSE

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
INTO THE PSYCHOLOGY
AND PHILOSOPHY

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
OF THE PEOPLES OF
CENTRAL MEXICO.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
THERE WERE ALSO TLATOLLIS
DEVOTED TO THE VARIOUS

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
DIVINITIES, STORIES OF
ANCIENT THINGS, LEGENDS,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
MYTHOLOGICAL TALES, AND
EVEN INCANTATIONS THAT

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
WOULD BE CHANTED BY
ASTROLOGERS AND SEERS.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
AT THE FOUNDATION OF
INDIGENOUS LITERATURE

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
ARE THE CREATION MYTHS
AND STORIES OF THE GODS

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
THAT SATURATED INDIGENOUS
LIFE BEFORE THE CONQUEST.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
IN CENTRAL MEXICO
THERE IS A FAMOUS STORY

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
IN WHICH THE EARTH IS
CREATED IN FIVE AGES.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
THIS IS THE LEGEND
OF THE FIVE SUNS:

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
THE SUN OF WATER,
OF EARTH, OF FIRE,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
OF WIND, AND
OF MOVEMENT.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
IN EACH SUCCESSIVE AGE
THERE APPEARED VARIOUS

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
ANIMALS AND HUMANS
COMPOSED OF DIFFERENT

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:17.000
MATERIALS: MUD, ASHES,
WOOD, AND FINALLY CORN.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
THIS ETIOLOGICAL SYSTEM
RESEMBLES THAT FOUND IN

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
OTHER SEMINAL TEXTS
SUCH AS THE POPOL VUH

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
OF THE QUICHES, OR THE
BOOKS OF THE CHILAM BALAM

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
FROM CHUMAYEL.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
THE SOURCE OF THE NAHUA
GODS IS THE SUPREME DEITY,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
CALLED OMETEOTL, THE
"GOD OF DUALITY".

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
OMETEOTL IS BOTH
MOTHER AND FATHER,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
AND IS THAT FROM WHICH
ALL ELSE IS CREATED.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
EACH OF FIVE SUNS TELLS
OF ONE MOMENT OF CREATION

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
AND OF DESTRUCTION
OF THE WORLD.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
AS MEN WERE MADE OF
MUD, ASHES, OR WOOD,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
THEY WERE WEAK
AND THEY DIED.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
AND SO THE GODS,
HORRIFIED TO WITNESS

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
THEIR DESTRUCTION
AND SUFFERING,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
DECIDED TO DIE IN A
SACRIFICE OF FIRE.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
THEY THREW THEMSELVES
INTO THE FLAMES AND ARE

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
CONSUMED BY FIRE,
GIVING BIRTH TO THE SUN,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
THE MOON AND THE CORN.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
THIS IS WHY THE NAHUAS
BELIEVED THAT THE SUN

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
EXISTS BY VIRTUE OF THE
SACRIFICE OF THE GODS,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
WHO IN TURN DEMAND
THE SACRIFICE OF MEN.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
IT WAS REFERRED,
 IT WAS HEARD THUS

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
THERE HAD ALREADY
 BEEN FOUR LIVES,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
AND THAT THIS WAS
 THE FIFTH AGE.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
IN THE YEAR 13, CANA,
 THEY SAY CAME TO EXIST,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
AND SO WAS BORN THE
 SUN THAT IS TODAY.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
THEN IT SHONE,
 AND IT DAWNED,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
THE SUN OF MOVEMENT
 THAT IS TODAY.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
ANOTHER CULTURAL ICON
OF THE MESO-AMERICANS

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
WAS QUETZALCOATL, KNOWN
BY THE MAYAS AS KUKULCÁN,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
WHO WAS BOTH A GOD AND
A PRIEST OF THE TOLTECS.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
LEGEND HAS IT THAT
QUETZALCOATL DETESTED

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
HUMAN SACRIFICE.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
AS A RESULT, HE WAS
DECEIVED BY HIS ENEMIES,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
AND WAS FORCED TO LEAVE THE
CITY TO SUFFER IN PURGATORY.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
BUT THE LEGEND FORETOLD
THAT HE WOULD COME BACK

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
ONE DAY, BRINGING ABOUT
THE END OF THE PRESENT AGE

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
AND THE RETURN OF
THE "GOLDEN AGE".

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
IT WAS SAID THAT
QUETZALCOATL WOULD RETURN

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
FROM THE PLACE WHERE
THE SUN GOES OUT.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
THE STORY GOES THAT AT
FIRST THE SPANIARDS

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
WERE THOUGHT TO BE
THIS LONG-AWAITED GOD,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
AND SO THEY WERE GIVEN THE
NAME OF TETEUH, OR GODS.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
ANOTHER NOTEWORTHY LEGEND
RECOUNTS THE BIRTH

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
OF HUITZILOPCHTLI,
THE SUN.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
HUITZILOPCHTLI WAS
CONCEIVED WHEN A BEAUTIFUL

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
BALL OF PLUMAGE TOUCHED
THE BOSOM OF COATLICUE,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
HIS MOTHER.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
HER BROTHERS, BELIEVING
SHE HAD BEEN DISHONORED,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
RESOLVED TO PUT
HER TO DEATH.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
HUITZILOPCHTLI WAS BORN AS
A FULLY REALIZED WARRIOR,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
AND HIS BIRTH LITERALLY
TORE HIS MOTHER APART -

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
WHICH IS WHY SHE IS
REPRESENTED AS A

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
DISMEMBERED BODY
IN ICONOGRAPHY

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
AT THE TEMPLO MAYOR
OF TENOCHTITLAN.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
IRONICALLY, HUITZILOPCHTLI
WAS BORN TO DEFEND HIS MOTHER.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
CARRYING DARTS AND A
SHIELD OF EAGLE'S FEATHERS,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
HE DEFEATED HER
ENEMIES EACH IN TURN.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
MANY OF THE
NAHUA SACRIFICES

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000
WERE DEDICATED TO HIM.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
AND THIS HUITZILOPCHTLI;
 AS IT WAS SAID,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
WAS A PRODIGY, FOR WITH
 ONLY ONE FINE FEATHER

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
THAT FELL UPON HIS
 MOTHER, COATLICUE'S WOMB

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
HE WAS CONCEIVED.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
NO ONE EVER APPEARED
 AS HIS FATHER.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
HE WAS WORSHIPPED
 BY THE MEXICAS,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
OFFERED SACRIFICES,
 HONORED AND SERVED,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:53.000
AND HUITZILOPCHTLI
 REWARDED THOSE WHO DID SO.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
THE GODS WERE HONORED
IN SONG AND IN CHANTS

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
WHICH WERE GATHERED
TOGETHER IN A COLLECTION

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
OF SACRED HYMNS BY FRIAR
BERNARDINO DE SAHAGUN.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
THEY WERE ALSO COLLECTED
IN CODICES SUCH AS THE

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
MATRITENSE, THE HISTORIA
TOLTECA-CHICHIMECA,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
AND THE FLORENTINO.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
THESE SONGS WERE SUNG IN
PRAISE OF THE ESSENTIAL

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
DIVINITIES OF MESO-AMERICA
- TLALOC, THE GOD OF RAIN

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
AND FERTILITY; XOCHIPILLI,
THE GOD OF LOVE, GAMES,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
SONG AND DANCE; COATLICUE
THE MOTHER OF THE GODS;

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
OMETEOTL, THE GOD OF
DUALITY, AND MANY OTHERS.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
THEY ARE A TESTAMENT
TO THE COMPLEXITY

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
OF THE MYTHICAL AND
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
OF THE ANCIENT MEXICANS.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
FOR A TRADITIONAL SOCIETY,
AS THEY ALL WERE UNTIL

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
THE 18TH CENTURY, THE
RELIGIOUS FESTIVITIES

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
WERE REAL
MILESTONES IN TIME.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
IN ANCIENT TIMES, IN
THE PRE-HISPANIC ERA

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
PARTICULARLY, THE
CELEBRATIONS AND

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
CEREMONIES OF CERTAIN
PARTS OF HISTORY,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
WHICH WAS PRISTINE AND
FUNDAMENTALLY MYTHICAL,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
WHERE GODS ACTED OUT, HAD
ALMOST ALWAYS TO DO WITH

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.000
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
AMONG THE MANY MYTHICAL
HISTORICAL STORIES OF

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
MESO-AMERICA, PERHAPS
THE MOST RENOWNED

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
IS THE POPOL VUH.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
A LITERARY JEWEL OF NATIVE
AMERICA CONSIDERED BY MANY

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
TO BE THE "BIBLE" OF
THE MAYAN PEOPLES.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
IT WAS PROBABLY
TRANSCRIBED FROM

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
HIEROGLYPHS BY MAYA
PRIESTS AND CLERKS

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
IN THE SIXTEENTH
CENTURY.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
THE MANUSCRIPT WAS
DISCOVERED IN THE EARLY

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
BY A PRIEST NAMED

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
FRANCISCO XIMENEZ IN
CHICHICASTENANGO, GUATEMALA.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
HE TRANSLATED THE
MANUSCRIPT INTO SPANISH.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
AS THE ORIGINAL TEXT HAS
BEEN LOST, ALL THAT

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
IS LEFT IS XIMENEZ'S
VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
THE POPOL VUH IS A CASE
OF ALPHABETICAL WRITING

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
FOR WHICH WE DON'T HAVE
THE PICTOGRAPHICAL TEXT,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
BUT WE HAVE AND WE KNOW
THROUGH INTERNAL REFERENCES

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
THAT IT IS BASED ON A
PICTOGRAPHICAL TEXT.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
BUT IT HAS DISAPPEARED.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
HOWEVER, THE TEXT TELLS
US THIS CONSTANTLY.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
IT GIVES US THE
SIGNS AND GESTURES

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
SUGGESTING THAT TEXT.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
THE POPOL VUH CONTAINS
THE CULTURAL HISTORY

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
OF THE QUICHE PEOPLE.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
THE NARRATIVE CAN BE
DIVIDED INTO TWO SECTIONS:

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
THE MYTHICAL AND
THE HISTORICAL,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
ALTHOUGH THE BOUNDARIES
BETWEEN THE TWO

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:56.000
ARE NOT ALWAYS
EASY TO DEFINE.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
WE ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN
 THE ANCIENT STORY

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
KNOWN AS THE QUICHE.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
WE SHALL BEGIN TO WRITE,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
TO TELL THE ANCIENT
 TALE OF THE BEGINNINGS,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
OR THE ORIGIN, OF ALL
 THAT WAS CARRIED OUT

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
IN THE QUICHE CITY BY THE
 MEN OF THE QUICHE TRIBES.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
WE SHALL PORTRAY
 WHAT HAPPENED

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
BEFORE THE WORD OF GOD,
 BEFORE CHRISTIANITY;

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
WE SHALL REPRODUCE
 IT FOR WE NO LONGER

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
HAVE THE VISION
 OF THE POPOL VUH,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
THE VISION OF DAWN, OF
 THE ARRIVAL FROM OVERSEAS,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
OF OUR LIFE
 IN THE SHADOWS,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
THE VISION OF
 THE DAWN OF LIFE.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
THE POPOL VUH TELLS OF
THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
AND ITS DIFFERENT AGES,
WHEN THE GODS CREATED

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
THE EARTH AND ALL
THAT IS IN IT,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
INCLUDING ANIMALS
AND HUMAN BEINGS,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
WHO INITIALLY LACKED
THE GIFT OF SPEECH.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
AS IN THE LEGEND
OF THE SUNS,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
THE GODS FIRST MAKE HUMANS
OUT OF WEAK MATERIAL

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
- FIRST OF MUD,
AND THEN OF WOOD.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
THEY INEVITABLY DIE BECAUSE
THEY ARE UNABLE TO THINK

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
AND THEY ARE UNWORTHY
OF THEIR CREATORS.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
IN ANOTHER AGE, THE GODS
CREATE MEN WHO ARE IN FACT

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
TOO WISE: "THEY UNDERSTAND
ALL BY JUST OBSERVING.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
THEY DOUBT NOTHING, THEY
ARE DETACHED FROM NOTHING".

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
SO THE GODS BLOW UPON THEM
TO MAKE THEIR SIGHT FOGGY

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
AND UNCLEAR.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
THEY NARRATE MYTHS,
EVERYDAY LIFE, HISTORY,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
RIVALRIES AND WARS
AMONG DIFFERENT GROUPS.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000
A STUDIOUS MAYAN
TELLS US ABOUT POETRY,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
ABOUT NARRATIONS THAT WE
COULD CALL SHORT FICTION,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
ABOUT MANY ANNALS

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
- WHICH ARE THE STORIES
OF DIFFERENT GROUPS -

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
THEIR ANCESTORS AND
THEIR RIGHT TO THE LAND.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
THE FIRST PART OF THE
STORY ENDS WITH THE

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
VICTORY OF THE TWINS,
HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
OVER THE INHABITANTS
OF XIBALBA,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
WHO ARE CREATURES
FROM THE UNDERWORLD.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
IN AN EPIC SCENE, THE
TWINS AVENGE THEIR

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
FATHER'S DEATH AT A
BALL GAME, AND THEN,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
TRIUMPHANT, ASCEND
INTO HEAVEN.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
THE SECOND PART OF THE
POPOL VUH BEGINS WITH

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
THE CREATION OF CORN - A
VITALLY IMPORTANT STAPLE

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
- AND RELATES THE TALE
OF THE "CORN PEOPLE".

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
THE POPOL VUH GOES ON TO
CHRONICLE THE STORY OF

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:26.000
THE QUICHE AND THEIR
CONSOLIDATION OF POWER.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
OH, CREATOR, EDUCATOR,
 LOOK AT US, LISTEN.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
DO NOT LEAVE US,
 DO NOT ABANDON US,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
YOU THAT ARE IN
 HEAVEN AND ON EARTH,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
HEART OF HEAVEN,
 HEART OF EARTH.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
LET THE NATIONS FIND
 PEACE, TRUE PEACE,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
AND LET THEM
 FIND HAPPINESS!

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
LEAD US TO A GOOD LIFE
 AND A WHOLE EXISTENCE.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
LET IT DAWN AND LET
 THE AURORA COME.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
THE CHILAM BALAM IS
A COLLECTION OF BOOKS

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
WRITTEN IN THE MAYA
LANGUAGE IN THE

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
SEVENTEENTH AND
EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
THE CHILAMES WERE
IMPORTANT PRE-HISPANIC

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
PRIESTS, AND CHILAM BALAM
PURPORTS TO CONTAIN

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
THE SECRETS OF THE
MAYA CIVILIZATION.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
TODAY ITS STORIES
ARE A PRIMARY SOURCE

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING
OF MAYA RELIGION, HISTORY,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
FOLKLORE, MEDICINE,
AND ASTRONOMY.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
IT IS SUPPOSED THAT THERE
WERE ONCE MANY MORE BOOKS

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
IN THE CHILAM BALAM
COLLECTION, THOUGH ONLY

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
A HANDFUL, NAMED FOR
THE TOWNS IN WHICH

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
THEY WERE WRITTEN, HAVE
SURVIVED UNTIL TODAY.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
IN THE MAYAN FIELD WHERE
TODAY THE WRITINGS ARE

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
80% OR 85% DECIPHERED,
THERE WAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
WITH THE GREAT
MAYAN INVESTIGATOR,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
MR. J. ERIC THOMPSON.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
HE SAID THERE WAS NO SUCH
THING AS MAYAN WRITINGS,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
THAT IT WAS ONLY
SYMBOLS, ESOTERIC.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
FROM THE MOMENT OF
THOMPSON'S DEATH

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
THERE WAS A LEAP TOWARDS
DECRYPTING MAYAN WRITING,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
UP TO TODAY WHEN WE
CAN SAY THAT MAYBE,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
AT THE MOST, THERE
ARE 5% OF RESEARCHERS

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
WHO DENY THERE
WAS MAYAN WRITING.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.000
IT'S CLEAR THE MAYANS HAD
WRITING; THAT'S INDUBITABLE.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
THE MAYAN WORLD COMES BACK
TO THE EUROPEAN CULTURAL

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
AWARENESS BECAUSE IT HAS
SURVIVED ARCHITECTURALLY.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
SO THE BOOKS
DIDN'T SURVIVE.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
BUT BECAUSE THE MAYANS
WROTE ON EVERYTHING -

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
ON PAPER, ON STONE, ON
WHATEVER - TEMPLES WERE

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
DISCOVERED THAT WERE
COVERED IN WRITING,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:39.000
AND THAT MAKES THE STUDY
OF THE GLYPHS BEGIN AGAIN.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
THESE TEXTS WERE
PRESERVED, COPIED,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
AND AMENDED BY
SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
THEY INCLUDE CHRONICLES
AND PROPHECIES,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
INCLUDING ONE THAT
SEEMS TO PREDICT

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
THE ARRIVAL OF THE
"MEN OF CASTILLA".

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
OH, IZTA! WIZARD
 OF THE WATER,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
THE COWARDS COME FORTH,
 WHITE FROM THE SKY,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
THE WHITE CHILDREN
 OF THE SKY.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
THE STICK OF WHITE
 SHALL DESCEND,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
COMING FROM THE HEAVEN,
 IT SHALL BE EVERYWHERE,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
AT DAWN YOU WILL
 SEE THE SIGNAL

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
ANNOUNCING ITS ARRIVAL.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
THE BOOKS OF THE CHILAM
BALAM RETAIN THEIR

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
CURRENCY TO THIS DAY, AND
CONSTITUTE AN ESSENTIAL

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
PART OF A CULTURE
THAT CONTINUES TO

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
REINTERPRET THEIR
MEANING IN NEW CONTEXTS.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
THE CHILAM BALAM IS A
TEXT THAT CONTINUES

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
TO BE WRITTEN AND
CONTINUES TO BE PAINTED,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
WHICH ALSO HAS GLYPHS.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
IT IS NOT A TEXT
THAT GIVES US DATA,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
BUT IT IS A TEXT THAT
CONTINUES GIVING PROPHECIES

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
AND CONTINUES ELABORATING
AND CONTINUES HAVING

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS
OF THE CALENDAR

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000
AND ANTICIPATING EVENTS
IN ALPHABETICAL WRITING.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
THE LITERATURE
OF THE ANDES,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
THOUGH RICH AND COMPLEX
IN ITS OWN RIGHT,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
IS NOT WELL KNOWN
OUTSIDE THE REGION.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
THE INCAN EMPIRE BOASTED
A STRONG FEDERALIST SYSTEM

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
WHICH EMPHASIZED
CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
AND THE LITERATURE IT
SPAWNED PROMOTED A SINGLE,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
SOMEWHAT PROPAGANDISTIC
VERSION OF THE PAST

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
IN WHICH PRIMITIVE,
BARBARIAN WAYS PREVAILED

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
UNTIL THE ARRIVAL
OF THE INCAS,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
WHICH LED TO AN ERA OF
GREAT SPLENDOR AND GLORY.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
THE ANDEAN AREA HAD
SIMILAR YET AT THE SAME

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
TIME DIFFERENT PROBLEMS
COMPARED TO MEXICO.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000
IN THE ANDEAN AREA THERE WAS
NOTHING LIKE THESE CODICES.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000
THERE WERE NO OBJECTS OF
SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
OF THE MEMORY THAT THE
EUROPEANS COULD RECOGNIZE

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
AS SUCH.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
THE ANDEAN CULTURE, AS
MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
IS THE MOST ORIGINAL.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
IT SEEMS TO BE A LOCAL
INVENTION, NOT LESS

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
VALUABLE BECAUSE OF THIS,
BUT THE PEOPLE SEEM TO

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
HAVE KEPT TO THEMSELVES
AND THEY DIDN'T RECEIVE

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:38.000
ANYTHING FROM ANYONE,
THEY WERE VERY SECLUDED.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
ONE REASON LITERATURE FROM
THE ANDEAN REGION HAS BEEN

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
MARGINALIZED IS THE
SYSTEMATIC SUPPRESSION

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
OF ITS INDIGENOUS METHOD
OF RECORDING INFORMATION

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
- THE QUIPU, A COMPLICATED
SYSTEM OF CORDS,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
KNOTS AND COLORS IN
VARIOUS COMBINATIONS.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
THE QUIPUS WERE READ
BY A SPECIALIST,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
KNOWN AS THE
QUIPU-CAMAYOC,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
WHO WAS ESSENTIALLY A
KIND OF INCAN ACCOUNTANT.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
THIS SYSTEM WAS USED TO
RECORD THE LIFE STORY

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
OF AN ENTIRE CULTURE;
EVERYTHING FROM ANIMAL AND

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
HUMAN CENSUSES TO THE EPIC
STORIES OF THEIR RULERS,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
STARTING WITH THE
MYTHICAL MANCO CAPAC.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
THE QUIPU WAS ONE ELEMENT
OF A LARGER SYSTEM

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
OF COLLECTIVE INCAN MEMORY
WHICH ALSO INCLUDED

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
ORAL TRADITIONS, THE WORK
OF THE QUIPU-CAMAYOC,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
AND THE BUREAUCRATIC
INFRASTRUCTURE

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
OF THE INCAN EMPIRE.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
WITH THE COMING OF
THE CONQUEST, HOWEVER,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
THIS SYSTEM
WAS DEVASTATED.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
THE QUIPUS WERE
CONFISCATED AND DESTROYED,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
THE QUIPU-CAMAYOC
WERE SUPPRESSED,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
AND THE
EMPIRE COLLAPSED.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
A GREAT MANY TALES OF
THE ANCIENT INCAS WERE

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
COMPILED BY NATIVE AND
MIXED-RACE CHRONICLERS

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
SUCH AS GUAMAN POMA DE
AYALA, FATHER BLAS VALERA,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
AND GARCILASO DE LA
VEGA, WHO TRANSCRIBED

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
HIS PEOPLE'S STORY
FOR LATER GENERATIONS.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
OTHER ACCOUNTS AND POEMS
HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
THROUGH THE CENTURIES
AND COME TO US WITH THE

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
TRAUMATIC RECOLLECTION
OF A TIME GONE BY.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL
TEXTS IN THE ANDEAN WORLD,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
AN ACCOUNT OF THE
GENESIS OF THE UNIVERSE,

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
IS THE MANUSCRIPT KNOWN AS
 RUNA YNDIO BY HUATOCHIRI.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
ACCORDING TO THE RUNA
 YNDIO - CONSIDERED BY MANY

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
TO BE THE POPOL
VUH OF THE ANDES -

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
THE WORLD UNDERWENT FOUR
AGES CALLED PACHACUTI.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
EACH AGE WAS MARKED BY
A PARTICULAR CATACLYSM:

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
THE FLOOD, THE
ECLIPSE, FIRE,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
AND THE "AUCA",
OR WARRIOR SPIRIT.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
THE STORY HAS TWO HEROES:
PARIARCA AND PACHACAMAC.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
TENDING TO THE HUACAS,

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
A TERM THAT REPRESENTS
SOMETHING REVERED

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000
SUCH AS AN ANCESTOR, A GOD
OR EVEN A CHARACTER TRAIT.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
THE STORY HAS MANY
ELEMENTS IN COMMON

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
WITH THE MESO-AMERICAN
LEGEND OF THE SUNS.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
IT WAS PICKED UP BY
CULTURES THAT BORDERED

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
THE TAHUANTINSUYU,
INCLUDING THE AMAZONIAN,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
THE MAPUCHE, AND THE
CHIBCAN CULTURES.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
THE JAYLLIS IS ANOTHER
IMPORTANT COMPONENT

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
OF INCAN
LITERARY CULTURE.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
THESE SACRED HYMNS ARE
DEDICATED TO PRAISING

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
THE GODS AND TO RECOUNTING
THE GREAT MYTHIC TALES.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
THEY WERE CULTIVATED
BY THE AMAUTAS,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
A SPECIAL CLASS
OF WISE MEN,

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
AND WERE CHANTED DURING
SOLEMN CEREMONIES.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
THERE ARE JAYLLIS
DEDICATED TO WIRAQUCHA,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
TO THE MOTHER MOON, TO THE
FIRST INCA, MANCO CAPAC,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
AND TO PACHACHAMAC.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
FATHER, LORD OF
 ALL CREATION!

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
WHEREABOUTS IN THE
 UNIVERSE ARE YOU?

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
IN HEAVEN OR IN THE
 WORLD OR HERE ON EARTH?

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:06.000
POUR YOUR WATERS FOR
 YOUR POOR, FOR YOUR MEN.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
QUECHUA LITERATURE ALSO
INCLUDES THE GENRE

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
KNOWN AS ARAWIS, A KIND
OF SONG THAT IS HIGHLY

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
ATTUNED TO THE RHYTHM
OF THE HUMAN CONDITION:

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
LOVE, PAIN, JOY,
SATIRE, GRIEF, DEATH.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
THE MOST FAMOUS OF THE
ARAWIS IS APU OLLANTAY,

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
A DRAMATIC WORK THAT IS
CENTRAL TO THE ANDEAN CANON.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
APU OLLANTAY TELLS
A CLASSIC STORY

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
OF LOVE AND WAR.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
WHEN THE NOBLE COMMONER
OLLANTAY IS DENIED

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
THE HAND OF THE
PRINCESS CUSI COYLLOR,

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
DAUGHTER OF PACHACUTEC,
HE REBELS AGAINST THE INCA

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
AND SETS UP
HIS OWN REALM.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
ULTIMATELY HE IS DEFEATED BY
THE LOYAL GENERAL RUMINAWI.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
IN AN UNEXPECTED
ACT OF MERCY,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
OLLANTAY AND CUSI
COYLLOR'S LIVES ARE SPARED,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
AND THEY ARE
ALLOWED TO MARRY.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
THE TAKI, THE WAYNU,
AND THE GHASWA

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
ARE OTHER INDIGENOUS
FORMS OF COMPOSITION,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
COMBINING MUSIC,
DANCE, AND SONG,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
OFTEN IN THE FORM OF
A RECITED DIALOGUE

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
AMONG GROUPS OF
MEN AND WOMEN.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
DRAMA WAS AN IMPORTANT
MECHANISM FOR ENABLING

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
THE INCAN CULTURE
TO SPEAK TO ITSELF,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
AND THERE WERE SEVERAL
GENRES AVAILABLE

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
FOR THIS CONVERSATION
TO TAKE PLACE.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
THE ARANWAY ARE SATIRICAL
FABLES BASED IN THE EVENTS

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
OF EVERYDAY LIFE, AND THE
WANKA ARE SOLEMN WORKS

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
EVOKING THE PAIN
OF LOSS AND GRIEF.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
SOME OF THE BETTER KNOWN
WANKA THAT WE STILL HAVE

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:43.000
MEMORIALIZE THE DEATHS OF THE
INCAS HUASCAR AND ATAHUALPA.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
LET US CRY, LET US
 CRY TEARS OF BLOOD,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
IN DESPAIR,
 LET US CRY ALOUD

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
FOR THE SUN HAS
 FOREVER TAKEN AWAY

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
THE LIGHT
 FROM HIS EYES.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
HIS BROW WE
 SHALL SEE NO MORE,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
NOR SHALL WE
 HEAR HIS VOICE

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:06.000
NOR WILL HIS TENDER
 EYES CARE FOR HIS PEOPLE.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
THE HISTORY AND SOCIAL
STRUCTURES OF THE NATIVE

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
PEOPLES OF AMERICA
WERE NEITHER SIMPLE

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
NOR PEACEFUL BEFORE THE
ARRIVAL OF THE SPANIARDS.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
GREAT EMPIRES ROSE AND
FELL, WARS WERE FOUGHT,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
TRIBUTES WERE DEMANDED
OF SUBJECT PEOPLES.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
THE STORIES THESE
CULTURES TOLD

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
WOVE TOGETHER AN INTRICATE
NARRATIVE TAPESTRY

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
OF FACT, FICTION, AND
POETIC EXPRESSION.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
EVEN THE MYTHICAL ACCOUNTS
SUCH AS THE POPOL VUH,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
THE CHILAM BALAM OR THE
APU OLLANTAY SERVED TO

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
ASSERT THE LEGITIMACY
OF THE RULING CLASS

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000
OR OF A RIGID
SOCIAL HIERARCHY.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
THE CODICE DESCRIBED THE
HISTORY OF THAT LEADER,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
EVERYTHING HE
HAD CONQUERED,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
EVERYTHING HE HAD DONE.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
THAT CREATES A PROBLEM
THAT MANY RESEARCHERS

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
FORGET ABOUT.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
BY HAVING
PRE-HISPANIC DOCUMENTS

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
ONE BELIEVES THE INDIGENOUS
WORD IS THE WORD OF GOD,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
WRITINGS OF THE PAST
LIED AS WE LIE TODAY.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
THE KINGS WOULD,
LOGICALLY,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
SAY WHAT WAS IN
THEIR BEST INTEREST

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
AND WHAT THEY
WANTED PEOPLE TO KNOW.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT
THEIR BATTLES, BUT ONLY

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
OF BATTLES THEY HAD WON,
NOT THE ONES THEY LOST.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
IT WAS BETTER FOR NOBODY
TO KNOW ABOUT THEM.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
YOU MUST TAKE THAT INTO
ACCOUNT WHEN STUDYING

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
PRE-HISPANIC,
MESO-AMERICAN WRITING.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
THE PAINTER OF CODICES
MUST ALWAYS BE CONSIDERED

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
AS AN INDIVIDUAL
CONNECTED IN SOME WAY

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
TO THE DOMINANT GROUP.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.000
WHY? BECAUSE THE CODICES
ARE ALWAYS A WAY OF SHOWING

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:54.000
THE INTERESTS, THE
HISTORY, THE ELEMENTS,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
WHICH ARE PART OF THE
DOMINATING GROUP,

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000
TO JUSTIFY THEIR
RULING OVER THE REST.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
IF IT'S A TRIBUTARY CODICE
IT CONTAINS THE ACCOUNTS

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
OF WHO PAID WHAT.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
IF IT'S A HISTORIC CODICE,
IT'S PARADIGMATIC HISTORY

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
- A HISTORY OF POWER,
A HISTORY OF THE

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
DOMINANT GROUP WHICH
IS ALWAYS JUSTIFYING

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
WHY THEY ARE THE
ONES WHO DOMINATE.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
THE ARRIVAL OF THE
SPANISH WAS AN EXPERIENCE

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
UNPRECEDENTED IN THE
ANNALS OF THE INDIGENOUS

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
PEOPLE OF CENTRAL
AND SOUTH AMERICA.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
NEVER IN THE THOUSANDS
OF YEARS OF PRE-HISPANIC

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
HISTORY HAD THERE BEEN
A SIMILAR ENCOUNTER.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
NOR WOULD HISTORY REPEAT
ITSELF ON THIS SCALE AGAIN.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE THAT
WOULD BRING ABOUT EXTREME

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
AND IRREVOCABLE CHANGE,
USHERING IN A PERIOD OF

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
CEASELESS UNCERTAINTY
AND CULTURAL ANXIETY.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
THE RESULTS OF THE SPANISH
CONQUEST WERE NOTHING

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
SHORT OF CATASTROPHIC
FOR THE NATIVE PEOPLE.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
DEVASTATION WROUGHT BY
DISEASES SUCH AS SMALLPOX;

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
THE DESTRUCTION OF
CITIES AND TEMPLES;

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
THE RELOCATION AND FORCED
LABOR OF ENTIRE POPULATIONS.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
A HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE
ARRIVAL OF THE SPANISH,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
THE NUMBER OF INDIGENOUS
PEOPLE HAD SHRUNK TO

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
10% OF THE PRE-HISPANIC
POPULATION.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
THIS HUMAN CATASTROPHE
HAD ENORMOUS IMPLICATIONS

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
FOR THE PRESERVATION
OF CULTURAL MEMORY -

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
THE STORIES AND ACCOUNTS
THAT HAD BEEN HANDED DOWN

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
THROUGH THE GENERATIONS.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
THIS TRAUMA IS PRESENT
IN THE NATIVE ACCOUNTS

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
OF THE CONQUEST,
IN THE OMNIPRESENT

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
SENSE OF FOREBODING
THAT LURKS IN SONGS

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:46.000
OF PROFOUND DRAMA AND
PAINSTAKING BEAUTY.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000
ALSO OUR MONKS, WHEN THEY
ARRIVE, A BIG PROBLEM

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
RESEARCHERS AND CONTEMPORARY
CULTURE ALSO HAVE,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
IS THAT WHEN THEY ARRIVE
AND FIND OUT ABOUT

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
THE CONTENT OF THE BOOKS,
WHICH ARE RELIGIOUS,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
THEY ARE CONSIDERED THE WORK
OF THE DEVIL AND ARE BURNT.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
THERE ARE FAMOUS
WRITINGS OF FAITH,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
"MANI" BY FRIAR
DIEGO DE LANDA,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
WHICH WERE SUSPECTED, AS WERE
THOUSANDS OF MAYAN BOOKS,

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
AND IN CENTRAL MEXICO
IN TENOCHTITLAN.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
THE ONE BY ZUMARRAGA,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
BISHOP ZUMARRAGA WHO
BURNT AZTEC CODICES.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
THEN THEY WERE PERSECUTED
BY THE INQUISITION

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
FOR A LONG TIME, AND
TO OWN AN ANCIENT BOOK

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
WAS PUNISHABLE
BY THE STAKE.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
THE BOOK AND THE OWNER
WERE BURNT, OF COURSE.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
DESPITE THEIR
CULTURAL DEVASTATION,

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE USED
THEIR LITERATURE TO GIVE

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
VOICE TO THEIR STRUGGLE,
COURAGE, AND LAMENTATION.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
THIS VOICE CAN BE HEARD IN
THE POIGNANT SONGS CALLED

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
ICNOCUICAT IN MESO-AMERICA
OR THE WANKA FROM THE

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
ANDEAN REGION, COMPOSED TO
REMEMBER THE CATASTROPHE

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
BUT ALSO TO HONOR THE
COURAGE OF RESISTANCE,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
TO SAFE KEEP THE MEMORY
OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED,

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
AND TO TRY TO
MAKE SENSE OF IT.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
WITH A STRONG DESIRE FOR
PRESERVATION AND SURVIVAL,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
MANY NATIVES BECAME
LITERATE IN THE

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
LANGUAGE OF THEIR
CONQUERORS IN ORDER TO

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
PRESERVE THEIR
TRADITIONAL WORLD VIEW

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
AND OTHER PIECES
OF THEIR OWN PAST.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
THIS ABILITY TO REFLECT
ON THEIR OWN HISTORY

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
WOULD ALSO ENABLE THEM,
IN THE YEARS TO COME,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
TO OVERCOME THE TRAUMA OF
THE CONQUEST, TO REBUILD

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000
THEIR SHATTERED IDENTITY
AND TO CREATE A NEW ONE.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
FIVE CENTURIES LATER THOSE
VOICES CAN STILL BE HEARD,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:43.000
THAT "VISION OF
THE DEFEATED".

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
AND ALL THAT
 HAPPENED WITH US.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
WE SAW IT,
 WE ADMIRED IT.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
WITH THE LAMENT AND
 SADNESS OF OUR LOT,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
WE FELT ANGUISHED.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
BROKEN DARTS LIE
 ON THE ROADS,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
SCATTERED
 IS THE HAIR.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
THERE ARE NO
 ROOFS ON THE HOUSES,

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
AND THEIR WALLS
 ARE REDDENED.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
WORMS WALK AROUND THE
 STREET AND SQUARES,

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
AND THE GUTS ARE
 SPLATTERED ON WALLS.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
RED ARE THE WATERS,
 AS IF THEY WERE DYED,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
AND WHEN WE
 DRANK FROM THEM,

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
IT WAS AS IF WE
 DRANK SALT WATER.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
MEANWHILE, WE KNOCKED
 ON THE MUD WALLS,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
AND OUR LEGACY WAS
 BUT A NET OF HOLES.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000
SHIELDS WERE
 USED AS REFUGE,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.000
ALTHOUGH SHIELDS CANNOT
 PROTECT THEM FROM SOLITUDE.
