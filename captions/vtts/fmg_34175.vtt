WEBVTT

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'M THE PRODUCER/DIRECTOR
OF GLOBAL CITIES,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
AN INTERNATIONAL
TELEVISION SERIES

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
WHICH DOCUMENTS
THE IMPACT OF IMMIGRATION

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
ON THE GLOBALIZATION PROCESS.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
HERE IN THE U.S.,
IN 1960, ONLY ONE-EIGHTH

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
OF THE POPULATION INCREASE
WAS DUE TO IMMIGRATION--

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
IN 2001, OVER ONE-THIRD OF IT.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
WHETHER BECAUSE
 OF THE PLIGHT OF REFUGEES,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
THE NEED
 FOR CHEAP FOREIGN LABOR,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
OR THE VERY NATURE
 OF ITS IMMIGRATION POLICY,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
THE U.S.
 IS FACING DEMOGRAPHIC PROBLEMS

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
THAT MAKE FOR VOLATILE,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
DANGEROUS
 NEW POLITICAL DISPUTES.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
TO EXAMINE THE ISSUES

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
SURROUNDING
THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'VE COME TO NEW YORK CITY,
WHICH IS THE GATEWAY

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
TO THE UNITED STATES, AS FAR AS
IMMIGRATION IS CONCERNED.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
YOU WILL HEAR
FROM ETHNIC LEADERS,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
POLITICIANS,
AND IMMIGRATION EXPERTS.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
LET'S BEGIN WITH FORMER
NEW JERSEY U.S. SENATOR,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
BILL BRADLEY.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
THE UNTOLD STORY OF AMERICA
IS THAT SINCE 1965,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
WE'VE HAD
A NEW WAVE OF IMMIGRANTS

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
THAT HAVE ENRICHED
THE DIVERSITY OF OUR COUNTRY,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
JUST AS
PREVIOUS WAVES HAVE DONE,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
AND THEY CAME FOR MANY REASONS.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
SOME OF THEM DID COME
TO GO TO WORK FOR COMPANIES,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
SOME OF 'EM CAME
BECAUSE THEY FLED OPPRESSION.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
SOME OF 'EM CAME
BECAUSE THEY WANTED

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CULTURE.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
SOME OF 'EM CAME
BECAUSE THEY WANTED

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE
FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
WELL, MOST IMMIGRANTS
TO THE UNITED STATES

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
ARE ADMITTED AS IMMIGRANTS,
NOT ON THE BASIS

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
OF A NEED FOR LABOR,
OR A NEED FOR SKILLS,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
BUT RATHER SIMPLY BECAUSE
THEY HAVE FAMILY CONNECTIONS

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
TO U.S. CITIZENS
OR LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENTS,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
FORMER IMMIGRANTS
TO THE UNITED STATES.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
THERE'S NO NUMERICAL LIMIT
ON SUCH ADMISSIONS

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
FOR IMMEDIATE FAMILY
OF U.S. CITIZENS.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
SO AS NATURALIZATION
TAKES PLACE,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
NEWLY,
NEWLY NATURALIZED CITIZENS

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
PETITION FOR THE ADMISSION
OF THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
AND YOU GET FLOWS THAT HAVE

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
NOTHING TO DO
WITH LABOR, OR NEED FOR LABOR.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
THE CONCERN THAT MANY PEOPLE
HAVE, AND ONE THAT I HAVE,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
IS THE LARGE NUMBER
OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
AS I TOLD YOU EARLIER,
WE HAVE OVER HALF A MILLION

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE
METROPOLITAN NEW YORK CITY AREA.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
AND THAT, TO ME, IS WRONG,
IT SHOULD NOT BE,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
BECAUSE WHAT YOU HAVE IS PEOPLE
WHO ARE FOLLOWING THE RULES,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
COMING IN, AND DOING
THE THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
AND OTHERS
WHO'RE JUST VIOLATING THE LAW,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
AND COMING IN, BEING SMUGGLED
IN, HOWEVER THEY GET HERE,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
WITH VISAS THAT ARE FORGED,
AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
DEBATE OVER IMMIGRATION ISSUES
IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
ARE CREATING EXPLOSIVE POLITICAL
CRISES IN MANY COUNTRIES.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
HERE IN THE U.S., 
 HUGE NEW WAVES OF IMMIGRANTS

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
CONSIDERED TOO SPICY
 FOR THE AMERICAN MELTING POT

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
ARE ALTERING
 ITS SOCIAL TEXTURE,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
AND CHANGING
 THE FACE OF AMERICA.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
MS. McHUGH, I'VE BEEN TOLD
 BY MANY NEW YORKERS

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
THAT THE NEW WAVE
OF IMMIGRANTS,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
PEOPLE WHO ARRIVE
IN THE '80s AND '90s,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
ARE REALLY CHANGING
 THE FACE OF NEW YORK CITY.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
DO YOU THINK THIS IS TRUE?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
WELL, ABSOLUTELY.
I THINK YOU CAN'T BE

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
TWO-THIRDS OF THE CITY
AND NOT HAVE CHANGED THE--

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
YOU KNOW, CHANGED EVERYTHING,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
FROM, OBVIOUSLY,
THE COMPLEXION OF THE CITY,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
RIGHT ON DOWN TO ITS, YOU KNOW,
ITS BASE OF BUSINESSES AND JOBS,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
ITS CULTURE,
ITS EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
SO, CERTAINLY I THINK

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
THAT THIS IS
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING NEW YORK,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
AND IN WAYS
THAT MOST NEW YORKERS EMBRACE

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
AND BELIEVE HAVE REALLY
BREATHED NEW LIFE INTO THE CITY.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK
AROUND THE UNITED STATES,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
THERE ARE A LOT OF CITIES
THAT ARE REALLY ON THE DECLINE,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
AND ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO GET MORE IMMIGRANTS.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
YEAH, I MEAN, IF YOU LOOK

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
AT A LOT OF
URBAN CENTERS IN AMERICA,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
THAT 20 YEARS AGO
WERE THOUGHT TO BE DEAD,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
THEY'RE ALIVE, AND THEY'RE ALIVE
BECAUSE OF IMMIGRANTS.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE CITIES
WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
FEW IMMIGRANTS,
THEY'VE MOVED VERY LITTLE.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CITIES
WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS,
YOU HAVE WHOLE NEW SUBCULTURES,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
THAT ADD TO THE DYNAMISM
AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
AND ULTIMATE PROSPERITY,
OF THAT COMMUNITY.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
RUIZ: MS. DESAI,
 THERE SEEMS TO BE

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
A LOT OF INTERACTION AMONG
 THE DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
THAT OCCUPY WHAT I CALL
THE CULTURAL MIDDLE GROUND

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
ARE THESE GROUPS CREATING
THEIR OWN CULTURAL SPACE?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
THEY DO.
THEY DO CREATE THEIR OWN SPACE.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
THEY DO, YOU KNOW,
COME TOGETHER.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
YOU'LL FIND POCKETS OF PEOPLE
LIVING, YOU KNOW,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
ALMOST LIKE
IN ISOLATION AT TIMES.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
BUT IT'S LIKE
9:00 TO 5:00, YOU KNOW.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
WHEN THEY ARE 9:00 TO 5:00
AT WORK, THEY ARE AMERICAN.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
BUT WHEN THEY GO HOME,
IT'S LIKE, GOING HOME

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
AND EATING
YOUR OWN TRADITIONAL FOOD,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
AND HAVING YOUR OWN CIRCLE
OF FRIENDS FROM BACK HOME,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
AND YOU SPEND YOUR WEEKENDS
AT THE RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
BUT YOU ALSO LEARN
TO, YOU KNOW, ACCULTURATE,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
IS PROBABLY THE WORD,
AND LEARN TO BE AMERICAN

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
DURING THE HOURS
THAT YOU NEED TO BE AMERICAN,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
AND OPERATE VERY PRODUCTIVELY,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
BUT AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAIN
 YOUR IDENTITY AND YOUR CULTURE.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
MR. LIU, IS IT POSSIBLE
IN NEW YORK CITY

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
TO BE BILINGUAL AND BICULTURAL?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
ABSOLUTELY, AND I WOULD THINK
THAT AS WE GET FURTHER ALONG,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
INTO THE FUTURE, PEOPLE
WOULD BECOME, FURTHERMORE,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
MULTILINGUAL, AND MULTICULTURAL.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
YOU LOOK AT THE--
I AM ASIAN-AMERICAN,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
ASIAN-AMERICAN,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
AND I'M PROUD TO BE.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I HAVE RETAINED MANY ASPECTS
OF MY ASIAN CULTURE,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
AND I AM FULLY IMMERSED
IN AMERICAN POP CULTURE.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
SO I'M VERY FORTUNATE
TO HAVE THAT.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I THINK AS, AS OUR SCHOOLS
BECOME MUCH MORE INTEGRATED,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
AND AS
OUR RESIDENTIAL AREAS,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
BASICALLY THE FABRIC
OF NEW YORK CITY,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
BECOMES MUCH MORE INTEGRATED,
PEOPLE WILL BECOME,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT,
MULTILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
RUIZ: TO SOME AMERICANS,
 IMMIGRANTS ARE A THREATENING,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
RATHER THAN INVIGORATING,
 FORCE IN NATIONAL LIFE,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
A DRAIN IN NATIONAL RESOURCES,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
OR EVEN A FIFTH COLUMN
 WITHIN THE NATION.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
AND FOR AMERICAN NATIONALISTS,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
IMMIGRANTS WHO REFUSE TO FULLY
INTEGRATE ARE SEEN AS A THREAT

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
TO THE NATIONAL AND ETHNIC
IDENTITY OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
SENATOR PADAVAN,
 NEW YORKERS TELL ME

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
THAT MANY NEW IMMIGRANTS
ARE NOT INTEGRATING

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
INTO THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
THAT THEY'RE NOT
 BECOMING AMERICAN,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
AND THAT THEY'RE CLINGING ONTO
THEIR OWN CULTURE AND LANGUAGE.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
IS THIS A CONCERN
IN NEW YORK CITY?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
WELL, IT'S ALWAYS A CONCERN,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I THINK IT'S A CONCERN
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
WHETHER THEY CAME
TO NEW YORK CITY,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
OR THEY CAME
INTO SOME EUROPEAN CITY,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
THAT THEY BRING THEIR CULTURE,
AND THEIR RELIGION,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
AND THEIR BACKGROUND,
AND THEIR WAY OF LIFE,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
WITH THEM, IT'S ONLY NATURAL.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
YOU JUST CAN'T-- BECAUSE
SOMEONE COMES ACROSS THE BORDER,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
AND GETS OFF A PLANE AT
LA GUARDIA OR KENNEDY AIRPORT,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
DOESN'T MEAN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE IS SOMETHIN' ELSE.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
HE IS WHAT HE IS,
AND HE GRAVITATES TO COMMUNITIES

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
WHERE HE FEELS
COMFORTABLE WITH OTHER PEOPLE

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
WITH SIMILAR BACKGROUNDS.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM
OF THE UNITED STATES

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
HAS VERY, VERY LITTLE INPUT

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
THROUGHOUT A CHILD'S
EDUCATIONAL YEARS

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
REGARDING ASIAN CULTURE,
ASIAN HISTORY, ASIAN LANGUAGES.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
AND AS A RESULT OF THIS,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
IT IS MORE
A FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
AND REALLY,
THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
BECAUSE THE ASIANS
ARE HERE IN AMERICA

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
VOLUNTARILY BY CHOICE.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
SOMEWHERE,
IN THEIR CURRENT GENERATION,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
OR THEIR MOST
PREVIOUS GENERATION,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
THEY'VE VOTED WITH THEIR FEET
TO COME TO AMERICA.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000
SO OUR EXISTENCE IN AMERICA
IS VERY, VERY PRECIOUS TO US.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
AND, THEREFORE,
WE HAVE EVERY REASON

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
TO CONTRIBUTE
TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS COUNTRY.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
WE BRING IT
IN MANY, MANY DIFFERENT WAYS,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
SOMETIMES ACADEMICALLY,
SOMETIMES IN A TECHNOLOGY,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
SOMETIMES EVEN WITH OUR FOOD.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
RUIZ: WE OFTEN HEAR
 THAT ONE OF THE BASIC CONCEPTS

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY
 IS FREEDOM OF RELIGION.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
DO YOU THINK THERE IS
 FREEDOM OF RELIGION

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
FOR MINORITIES,
 HERE IN THE U.S.?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
THERE IS FREEDOM OF RELIGION

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
FROM THE GOVERNMENT
POINT OF VIEW.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
IN OTHER WORDS,
THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT--

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
IT GIVES YOU
THE SAME BENEFITS, SO TO SAY,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
WHETHER YOU ARE A HINDU

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
OR AT A CHRISTIAN CHURCH,
OR WHATEVER.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
BUT IF YOU WERE TO ASK ME
WHETHER OR NOT

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
THEY ARE KEPT AT THE SAME LEVEL,
THE ANSWER IS NO.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
IN THIS SENSE, WOULD CHRISTIANS

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
ALSO LOOK UPON THE MINORITY
RELIGIONS IN THE SAME FASHION,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
AS THEY PROFESS
TO HAVE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
PROBABLY NOT SO,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
BECAUSE OF THE MAJORITY
OF THE CHRISTIANS.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
BUT FROM THE GOVERNMENTAL LEVEL,
SEEKING THE BENEFITS--

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
FOR EXAMPLE, 
LET'S SAY WE NEED TAX EXEMPTION,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
BECAUSE WE ARE
ALSO A RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
AS LONG AS
YOU ARE AN ESTABLISHED,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
YOU ARE ALLOWED TO GET
THE SAME KIND OF BENEFITS,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
WHATEVER THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWS,
WHETHER YOU ARE A CHURCH,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
A TEMPLE, SYNAGOGUE,
WHATEVER IT BE.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
RUIZ:
 SENATOR PADAVAN, I SENSE

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
THAT MANY
 NATIVE-BORN NEW YORKERS

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
WITH THE ARRIVAL

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF NON-EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
WHO ARE DEMANDING TO PLAY A ROLE
IN THE LIFE OF THE CITY.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
WHEN THE ITALIANS AND THE IRISH
CAME IN GREAT NUMBERS,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
AS AN EXAMPLE,
IN THE TURN OF THE CENTURY,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
THERE WAS SOME--
THERE WAS RESENTMENT

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
ON THE PART OF SOME PEOPLE

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
WHO FELT
THAT THIS WAS NOT DESIRABLE.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
'COURSE, TURNED OUT
THEY WERE WRONG--

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
IT WAS DESIRABLE,
THE NET RESULT.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
IT'S HUMAN NATURE.
WE DON'T LIKE CHANGE.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
AND WHEN IT'S
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
WE LIKE IT EVEN LESS.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
RUIZ: MR. MARTINEZ,
 A LOT OF LATINOS

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
COMPLAIN OF RACISM
IN NEW YORK CITY.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
A HIGH SCHOOL GIRL
 FROM THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
TOLD ME THAT
SHE'S OFTEN CALLED "NIGGER."

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
IS THERE RACISM IN THIS SOCIETY?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I THINK THERE IS
RACISM IN THIS SOCIETY.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
I THINK WE'VE DONE--
WE'VE GONE A LONG WAY

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
IN TERMS OF IMPROVING
THE RELATIONSHIP

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
BETWEEN
THE DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
BETWEEN WHITES
AND BLACK AND LATINOS.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
BUT THERE STILL EXISTS
SOME FRICTION

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
IN TERMS OF THE WAY
WE INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
YOU KNOW, MR. MARTINEZ,
SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
THAT LATINOS MAKE TOO MUCH FUSS
ABOUT BEING DISCRIMINATED.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
THAT IS WHAT A CITY OFFICIAL
HERE IN NEW YORK TOLD ME.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
DO YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
WELL, I DON'T THINK
IT'S MAKING A FUSS,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
IT'S MORE OF
BRINGING ATTENTION AND AWARENESS

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING
THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE GETTING.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
IT'S BRINGING ATTENTION
THAT WE ARE A MAJORITY.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
WE ARE NOT ONLY A MAJORITY,
WE ARE AN ACTIVE MAJORITY

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
THAT'S STARTING
TO PARTICIPATE AND VOTE.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
THIS CITY IS NOW TWO-THIRDS
IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR CHILDREN.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE
WHO LIVE HERE IN NEW YORK CITY

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
ARE FROM IMMIGRANT FAMILIES.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE
ARE FROM IMMIGRANT FAMILIES.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
AND YET THEIR NEEDS
HAVE GONE UNADDRESSED

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
FOR A VERY, VERY LONG TIME.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
AND THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU EITHER HAVE TO HAVE

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
A LOT OF MONEY TO GIVE
IN CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
OR A LOT OF VOTES,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
IN ORDER TO HARNESS
THE POLITICAL PROCESS

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
TO YOUR COMMUNITY'S NEEDS.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
AND SO,
FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS OR SO,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
MANY GROUPS IN OUR NETWORK
HAVE BEEN STRIVING VERY HARD

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
TO TRY AND HAVE IMMIGRANTS COME
INTO THE MAINSTREAM POLITICALLY.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
RUIZ: MR. LIU,
 HERE IN NEW YORK CITY,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
ETHNIC MINORITIES ARE EMERGING
 AS A POLITICAL FORCE

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
WITH THE POWER
 TO SWING DISTRICT ELECTIONS.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
WILL THIS LEAD
TO MINORITY GROUPS

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
WORKING TOGETHER
FOR COMMON GOALS,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
OR TO COMPETING
AGAINST EACH OTHER?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
WELL, YOU KNOW, NEW YORK CITY
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A MOSAIC

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
OF DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
AT THE TURN OF THE PRIOR
CENTURY, IN THE EARLY 1900s,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
YOU HAD
DIFFERENT GROUPS COMING IN,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
IMMIGRATING FROM EUROPE,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
AND THERE WERE, THERE WAS
ECONOMIC COMPETITION,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
POLITICAL COMPETITION,
MUCH THE SAME AS YOU HAVE NOW,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
AT THE TURN
OF THE 21st CENTURY.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
WE DO HAVE
DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
COMING IN
FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF ASIA.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
YOU TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, LATINOS.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
YOU'VE GOT DIFFERENT GROUPS
OF LATINOS COMING IN,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
THEY'RE COMPETING
AGAINST EACH OTHER

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
FOR ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL
AND SOCIAL OPPORTUNITY.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, CHINA.
YOU'VE-- THAT'S A HUGE COUNTRY.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
YOU'VE GOT DIFFERENT GROUPS
OF PEOPLE FROM CHINA COMING,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
AGAIN, COMPETING,
AND THAT'S WHAT AMERICA'S ABOUT.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
AMERICA IS
A SOCIETY OF COMPETITION.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I THINK THAT WHAT WE FEEL,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
AND MAYBE
WE'RE IN A UNIQUE POSITION,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
BEING HERE IN NEW YORK.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
BUT-- BUT I--
WE HEAR ALL THE TIME

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
THAT PEOPLE VALUE
IMMIGRANTS COMING IN

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE
AMERICAN THAN MOST AMERICANS.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
THEY'RE MORE IDEALISTIC,
THEY BELIEVE IN FREEDOM,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD
EXPERIENCES OF BEING REPRESSED

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
IN A VERY SERIOUS WAY.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
THEY'VE HAD THEIR
EITHER RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
POLITICAL PERSECUTION,
LACK OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
AND SO THEY BELIEVE
VERY STRONGLY

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
IN A LOT
OF THE CORE AMERICAN VALUES,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
AND-- AND ACTUALLY
REJUVENATE THE CULTURE.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
ONE-THIRD OF ALL START-UPS
IN SILICON VALLEY IN THE 1990s

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
WERE STARTED BY ENTREPRENEURS
OF ASIAN ANCESTRY.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
BY FAR THE LARGEST, THE LARGEST
MINORITY IN THE COUNTRY

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
IN 15 OR 20 YEARS
WILL BE LATINOS.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
YOU KNOW, AMERICA IS
A TREMENDOUSLY RICH PLACE,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN TRUER

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
THAT WE WILL EITHER
ALL ADVANCE TOGETHER,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
OR EACH OF US
WILL BE DIMINISHED.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
MR. MARTINEZ,
HISPANICS HAVE BECOME

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
THE LARGEST MINORITY
IN THE U.S., BUT YOU CLAIM

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
THAT THE OPPORTUNITIES OTHER
 MINORITIES HAD IN THE PAST

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
ARE NOT THERE FOR LATINOS.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
YEAH, FOR EXAMPLE, YES,
WHEN WE'RE BECOMING A MAJORITY,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
BUT THEN THEY'RE
CLOSING THE OPPORTUNITIES

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
FOR US TO WORK,
FOR US TO GET INTO, LIKE,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
BECOMING A POLICE OFFICER,
BECOMING A FIREMAN.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
BEFORE, YOU ONLY HAD TO HAVE
A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
AND YOU WERE QUALIFIED
TO BECOME A POLICE OFFICER.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
NOW THEY'RE TELLING YOU,
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME COLLEGE.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
FOR MANY YEARS,
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS USED

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
BY MANY IMMIGRANT GROUPS, A WAY
INTO, GOING INTO GOVERNMENT,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
GETTING A GOOD JOB, A SECURE JOB

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
THAT WILL OFFER RETIREMENT,
VACATION, HEALTH INSURANCE,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
FOR YOUR FAMILY AND YOURSELF.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
BUT THEY WERE MOSTLY WHITE
IMMIGRANT, IRISH, SOME ITALIAN.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
AND NOW WE HAVE A LARGE GROUP
OF IMMIGRANT BLACK AND LATINO,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
MOSTLY LATINO, WHO ARE BECOMING
A BIG MAJORITY IN THIS CITY,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL,
AND THEY'RE TELLING THEM,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
WE'RE NOT GIVING YOU
THE SAME OPPORTUNITY.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE
INTO COLLEGE,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
WHICH IS GOOD, FOR SOME SENSE,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
BUT THEY'RE ALSO
CLOSING DOORS FOR US,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
BECAUSE WHEN WE GO
TO THE UNIVERSITY,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
THEY'RE ALSO TELLING US,
NOW YOU GOTTA PAY MORE MONEY

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
FOR THE SAME EDUCATION
THAT OTHER IMMIGRANTS HAD.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT ISSUE YOU RAISED,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
OR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I DON'T HONESTLY KNOW
THE SITUATION THERE.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE
THAT FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
FIREMEN AND POLICEMEN ARE USING

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
PRETTY SOPHISTICATED MACHINERY
THESE DAYS.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I MEAN, THEY'RE--
A LOT OF THIS IS COMPUTERIZED,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
AND YOU PROBABLY DO WANT
SOMEBODY WHO IS WELL--

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
MUCH BETTER-EDUCATED
THAN YOU USED TO DEMAND

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
OF A POLICEMAN
WALKING THE BEAT.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
SO IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH DISCRIMINATION?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN...

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I HAVE NEVER
HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
IN FACT, I'VE ALWAYS HEARD
THAT THE POLICE FORCE IS OUT

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
BEATING THE BUSHES TO ATTRACT
PEOPLE FROM ETHNIC MINORITIES

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
TO APPLY FOR POLICE POSITIONS,
AND FIRE POSITIONS.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
BUT I DON'T KNOW THE FACTS,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
SO I'M THE WRONG WITNESS
FOR THIS QUESTION.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
THE ZIGZAGS AND REVERSALS OF
AMERICAN POLICY ON IMMIGRATION

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
REFLECT CHANGES
IN POLITICAL OUTLOOK.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
BUT THROUGH IT ALL,
IMMIGRATION QUESTIONS

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
ARE BECOMING
MORE PROMINENT, MORE DIVISIVE,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
AND MORE DIFFICULT TO HANDLE.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
AND WE'VE ALWAYS HAD A HIGHLY,
HIGHLY, COMPULSIVELY STRUCTURED

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
IMMIGRATION POLICY, WHERE
WE EXPEND TREMENDOUS RESOURCES

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
ON THESE QUESTIONS OF PROCESSING
PEOPLE FOR COMING IN,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
AND, YOU KNOW,
DEFENDING THE BORDER,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
AND DEALING WITH IMMIGRATION
ASPECTS OF THIS ISSUE,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
AND VIRTUALLY NO RESOURCES
AND NO THINKING

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
ON THE QUESTION
OF IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
AS IF IT'LL HAPPEN BY MAGIC.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
SO WE'RE SPENDING
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
ON OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM,
AND WE DON'T HAVE ONE PERSON,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
NOT ONE PERSON
IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
WHOSE JOB IT IS TO THEN
TAKE A LOOK ACROSS THE COUNTRY

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
AND SAY, SO WHAT'S HAPPENING,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
NOW THAT
WE'VE LET THESE PEOPLE IN?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
MR. TEITELBAUM,
AS WE ENTER THE 21st CENTURY,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
THERE SEEMS TO BE
A HEATED DEBATE

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
ON WHAT THE AMERICAN NATIONAL
AND ETHNIC IDENTITY SHOULD BE.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
SHOULD AMERICA
REMAIN A MELTING POT,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
OR BECOME
MORE LIKE A SALAD BOWL?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
IT'S A VERY MESSY DEBATE,
FULL OF EMOTION,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.000
AND EXTREME CLAIMS
ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE PEOPLE
WITH NATIONAL IDENTITIES,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
OR ETHNIC IDENTITIES,
OR RELIGIOUS IDENTITIES

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
THAT DIFFER FROM ONE ANOTHER,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
AND I THINK
AMERICAN HISTORY HAS SHOWN

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
THAT THESE PEOPLE
CAN LIVE TOGETHER SUCCESSFULLY,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
WORK TOGETHER SUCCESSFULLY,
IN AN INTEGRATED FASHION,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
IF THEY SHARE
A COMMON SET OF VALUES,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
A COMMON SET
OF NATIONAL IDENTITY,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
IN ADDITION
TO THEIR OTHER IDENTITIES,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
AND A WAY TO COMMUNICATE
WITH EACH OTHER SUCCESSFULLY

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
IN A COMMON LANGUAGE.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
MS. DESAI, FOR YOU PERSONALLY,
IS IT POSSIBLE

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
TO LIVE IN TWO CULTURES
AT THE SAME TIME?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
FOR ME? YES.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
BECAUSE I HAVE
VERY SPECIFIC BOUNDARIES,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
AND IT'S LIKE,
WHEN I KNOW I'M TEACHING DANCE,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
AND I GO TO THE STUDIO,
AND MY STUDENTS COME,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
THAT'S ALL I'M ABOUT,
IS I'M TEACHING DANCE,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
AND I'M TRYING TO MAINTAIN

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
THE ABSOLUTE, TRADITIONAL,
CLASSICAL DANCE STYLE.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
AND THAT'S, FOR ME,
ABSOLUTE, PURE FORM

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
OF BEING WHERE I AM
AT THAT POINT IN TIME.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
WHEN I GO TO WORK,
THAT GOES OUT THE WINDOW.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
AND I AM AT WORK, I'M,
YOU KNOW, DRESSED DIFFERENTLY,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
I'M MEETING PEOPLE
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
DEEP IN YOUR HEART,
WHAT ARE YOU?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
DEEP IN MY HEART, I'M ME...

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
INDIAN, IN AMERICA.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
HOW DO NEW IMMIGRANTS SEE THE
AMERICAN MELTING POT CONCEPT?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
I THINK
THERE'S A VERY STRONG SENSE

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
THAT PEOPLE IN THE PAST
HAVE HAD TO GIVE UP TOO MUCH,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
AND GIVE UP THINGS
THAT WERE EXTREMELY VALUABLE

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
FROM THEIR HOME COUNTRIES,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
AND WE CERTAINLY SEE THAT NOW,
WITH MANY IMMIGRANTS FEELING

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
THAT THE AMERICAN CULTURE,
FOR EXAMPLE, IS TOO PERMISSIVE,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
OR LACKS DISCIPLINE,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
AND SO THAT THEY DON'T WANT
THEIR CHILDREN TO BE IN SCHOOLS

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
WHERE THEY ARE SUDDENLY WEARING
THESE BAGGY CLOTHES

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
THAT ARE FALLING DOWN
AROUND THEIR ANKLES,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
OR THE HIGHLY SEXUALIZED NATURE
OF HIGH SCHOOL,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
TEENAGE CULTURE HERE IN THE U.S.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
AND SO THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
THAT IMMIGRANTS ARE LOOKING AT

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
IN TERMS OF THE DOMINANT CULTURE
HERE, AND SAYING, WAIT A MINUTE,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
I WANT TO PASS ALONG A DIFFERENT
SET OF VALUES TO MY KIDS.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
RUIZ: SENATOR BRADLEY, FOR
 GENERATIONS HERE IN THE U.S.,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
THERE'S BEEN AN UNWRITTEN CODE
 TO AMERICANIZE

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
ANYBODY
 WHO COMES TO THIS COUNTRY.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
DO YOU THINK THAT HAS CHANGED?

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
BECAUSE MANY AMERICANS
ARE NOW SAYING,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
WE CANNOT AMERICANIZE
THE NEW WAVE OF IMMIGRANTS.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
LET THEM BE
WHATEVER THEY WANT TO BE.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
WELL, NO, I MEAN, I THINK
THAT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU MEAN

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
BY "AMERICANIZE."
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I LOOK AT IT

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
AS PEOPLE WHO COME,
WHO HAVE DIFFERENT RELIGIONS,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES,
DIFFERENT RACES.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
THEY ADD THEIR VOICE
TO THE DEFINITION

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
OF WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE AN AMERICAN.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
RUIZ: THE CONCEPT
 OF RACE, NATIONAL ORIGIN,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
ETHNIC ORIGIN, AND ANCESTRY,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
HAVE A LONG AND TORTUROUS
 HISTORY IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000
IN 2000, JUST 35%
OF NEW YORK CITY WAS WHITE, OK?

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
SO NON-WHITES
ACTUALLY COMPRISE A MAJORITY

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
OF NEW YORK CITY'S POPULATION.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
BUT ONE MUST EXERCISE CAUTION

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
WHEN ONE TALKS
ABOUT RACE GROUPS.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
IN 1900, ITALIANS AND JEWS
WERE NOT CONSIDERED WHITE.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
TODAY,
THEY ARE CONSIDERED WHITE,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
AND INCLUDED, YOU KNOW,
WITH OTHER WHITES.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
SO RACE IS
A VERY CHANGING CONCEPT,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
IT'S A VERY MALLEABLE CONCEPT,
AND CATEGORIES THAT EXIST TODAY

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
ARE UNLIKELY TO EXIST
IN 30 TO 40 YEARS,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
ESPECIALLY GIVEN
THE HIGH RATES OF INTERMARRIAGE.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
OVER ONE-HALF
OF ASIAN WOMEN OUT-MARRY, OK?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
AND CLOSE TO ONE-HALF
OF HISPANICS OUT-MARRY.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
GIVEN THESE
HIGH RATES OF OUT-MARRIAGE,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
THE CURRENT RACIAL DEFINITIONS
ARE GOING TO BE QUITE INADEQUATE

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
IN THE COMING DECADES.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
IN 2000,
THE CENSUS BUREAU INTRODUCED

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
A NEW RACIAL CLASSIFICATION
CALLED "MULTIRACIAL."

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
ORIGINALLY,
RACIAL CATEGORIES WERE SIMPLE:

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
WHITE, NEGRO, AND INDIAN.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
TODAY, THERE ARE
16 DIFFERENT RACIAL CATEGORIES.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
THE CATEGORIES OF RACE

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
HAVE ALWAYS INTERESTED
 SOCIAL SCIENTISTS.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
BUT THEIR POLITICAL IMPORTANCE
 INCREASES DRAMATICALLY

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
WHEN THESE CATEGORIES ARE USED

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
TO AWARD
 PRIVILEGES OR BENEFITS.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
MR. MARTINEZ,
WHAT DO YOU THINK LATINOS,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
THE LARGEST
ETHNIC MINORITY IN THE U.S.,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
HAVE TO DO
 TO GET MORE OPPORTUNITIES?

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
YES. GET ORGANIZED,
DEMONSTRATE, PEACEFULLY,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
IN TERMS OF
GETTING THE POINT ACROSS,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
VOTE, ENDORSE CANDIDATES,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
GET INVOLVED
IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
AND WE WILL SEE CHANGES.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
MS. McHUGH, WHAT
CAN WE EXPECT IN THE FUTURE?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
WILL THE U.S.
BE RESHAPED BY IMMIGRANTS

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
WHO ARE DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN
THEIR OWN CULTURE AND LANGUAGE?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
YEAH. I THINK
THAT MOST PEOPLE,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
WHEN THEY'RE, YOU KNOW,
POSED WITH THIS QUESTION,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
ABOUT WHAT
WILL THE FUTURE BRING,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
THEY JUST SAY, STAY TUNED.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
ANYBODY WHO KNOWS
WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
KNOWS THAT THEY CAN'T PREDICT
WHAT IT WILL BE.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT-- I THINK
THAT THE CULTURE WAR IN THE U.S.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
REPRESENTED BY SOMEONE LIKE
PAT BUCHANAN, YOU KNOW, SAYING,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
THIS IS TERRIBLE, IT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE THE 1950s ANY MORE.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
WELL, THANK GOD IT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE THE 1950s.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
AND THEN A WHOLE LOT
OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
WHO KNOWS? YOU KNOW, THIS IS,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
THIS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE
OF CHANGE, OF DIVERSITY.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
WE'VE NEVER BEEN
IN THIS PLACE BEFORE.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE IT'S GOING TO LEAD US,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
AND SO, LET'S GET BACK
TO SORT OF CORE, CORE SERVICES,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
LIKE A STRONG EDUCATION SYSTEM,
LIKE MAKING SURE

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
THAT WE HAVE AS LEVEL
A PLAYING FIELD AS POSSIBLE

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
IN TERMS OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE
TO MOVE INTO THE HOUSING MARKET,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
INTO THE JOB MARKET,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
SO THAT WE AT LEAST ARE MAKING
SURE THAT WE--

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
THAT PEOPLE HAVE
DOORS OPEN, AND OPPORTUNITIES,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE BUILDING A NEW CULTURE,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
AND WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
WE THINK ARE SMART
AND WISE TO MAKE.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
BUT THEN, YOU KNOW,
SEE WHAT COMES OUT OF IT.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT--
ALL WE CAN PREDICT

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
IS THAT
IT WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
I DON'T THINK
ANYONE HAS A CRYSTAL BALL,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
AN ACCURATE CRYSTAL BALL,
ON THE FUTURE.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN
IN THESE SETTINGS.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
BUT THERE IS,
THERE ARE POSITIVE SIGNS,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
AND NEGATIVE SIGNS,
ABOUT SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
AND IF ONE IS AN ADVOCATE
ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
YOU CAN PICK THE POSITIVE
OR PICK THE NEGATIVE SIGNS,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
AND SAY,
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
I THINK IT'S
MUCH MORE NUANCED THAN THAT.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
NO ONE
CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
BUT ONE THING WE CAN BE SURE OF:
THE CONFLICT OVER IMMIGRATION

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
AND THE ROLE
OF IMMIGRANTS IN U.S. SOCIETY

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
WILL GO ON.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
AND GIVEN THE VOLATILITY
OF IMMIGRATION FLOWS,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
AND THE DIFFICULTIES
OF MEASURING THEM,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
THE CONFLICT
IS BOUND TO INTENSIFY.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR WATCHING.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:09.000
