00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:36.000


2
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.270
Hence, home, you idle creatures,get you home.

3
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.830
Is this a holiday?

4
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.070
What, know you not you ought notwalk

5
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.000
upon a laboring day without thesign of your profession?

6
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.330
Speak.

7
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.430
What trade art thou?

8
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.070
Why, sir, a carpenter.

9
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.130
Where is thy leather apron andthy rule?

10
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.600
What dost thou with thy bestapparel on?

11
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.770
You, sir, what trade are you?

12
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.330
Truly, sir, in respect of a fineworkman,

13
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.970
I am but, as you would say, acobbler.

14
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.130
But what trade art thou?

15
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.570
Answer me directly.

16
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.100
A trade, sir, that I hope I mayuse with a safe conscience,

17
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.830
which is indeed, sir, a menderof bad soles.

18
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.500
What trade, thou knave?

19
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.730
Thou naughty knave, what trade?

20
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.400
I beseech you, sir, be not outwith me;

21
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.530
yet, if you be out, sir, I canmend you.

22
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.600
What mean'st thou by that?

23
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.070
Mend me, thou saucy fellow!

24
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.570
Why, sir, cobble you.

25
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.900
Thou art a cobbler, art thou?

26
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.570
Truly, Sir, all that I live byis with the awl;

27
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.430
I meddle with no tradesman'smatters, nor women's matters,

28
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.870
but with awl.

29
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.400
I am indeed, sir, a surgeon toold shoes;

30
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.430
when they're in great danger, Irecover them.

31
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.970
as proper men as ever trod uponneat's leather

32
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.300
have gone upon my handiwork.

33
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.800
But wherefore art not in thyshop today?

34
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.900
Why dost thou lead these menabout the streets?

35
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.470
Truly, sir, to wear out theirshoes

36
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.600
to get myself into more work.

37
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.030
But indeed, sir, we make holidayto see Caesar

38
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.670
and to rejoice in his triumph.

39
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.200
Caesar! Caesar!

40
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.230
Wherefore rejoice?

41
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.430
What conquest brings he home?

42
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.500
What tributaries follow him toRome

43
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.800
to grace in captive bonds hischariot wheels?

44
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.000
You blocks, you stones, youworse than senseless things!

45
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.330
O you hard hearts, you cruel menof Rome,

46
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.600
knew you not Pompey?

47
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.330
Many a time and oft have youclimb'd up to walls

48
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.770
and battlements, to towers andwindows, yea, to chimney tops,

49
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.300
your infants in your arms,

50
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.230
and there have sat the livelongday in patient expectation

51
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.930
to see great Pompey pass thestreets of Rome.

52
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.170
and when you saw his chariot butappear,

53
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.430
have you not made an universalshout

54
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.200
that Tiber trembled underneathher banks

55
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.930
to hear the replication of yoursounds

56
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.500
made in her concave shores?

57
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.870
and do you now put on your bestattire?

58
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.770
and do you now cull out aholiday?

59
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.070
and do you now strew flowers inhis way

60
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.600
that comes in triumph overPompey's blood?

61
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.370
Be gone!

62
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.730
Run to your houses, fall uponyour knees,

63
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.330
pray to the gods to intermit theplague

64
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.670
that needs must light on thisingratitude.

65
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.000
Go, go, good countrymen.

66
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.600
For this fault, assemble all thepoor men of your sort,

67
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.000
draw them to Tiber banks,

68
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.200
and weep your tears into thechannel,

69
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.400
till the lowest stream do kissthe most exalted shore of all.

70
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.230
See whether their basest metalbe not moved;

71
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.200
They vanish tongue-tied in theirguiltiness.

72
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.930
Go you down that way towards theCapitol;

73
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.200
this way will I.

74
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.700
Disrobe the images if you dofind them

75
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.870
deck'd with ceremonies.

76
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.970
May we do so?

77
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.330
You know it is the feast ofLupercal.

78
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.200
It is no matter; let no imagesbe hung with Caesar's trophies.

79
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.670
I'll about and drive away thevulgar from the streets;

80
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.130
so do you too, where youperceive them thick.

81
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.300
These growing feathers pluck'dfrom Caesar's wing

82
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.870
will make him fly an ordinarypitch,

83
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.830
who else would soar above theview of men

84
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.600
and keep us all in servilefearfulness.

85
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.500
Hail, Caesar!

86
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.500
Hail, Caesar!

87
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.570
Caesar!

88
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.470
Hail, Caesar!

89
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.470
Peace, ho!

90
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.070
Caesar speaks.

91
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.170
Calpurnia.

92
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.300
Here, my lord.

93
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.930
Stand you directly in Antonio'sway,

94
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.870
when he doth run his course.

95
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.000
Antonios.

96
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.500
Caesar, my lord?

97
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.100
Forget not in your speed,Antonio, to touch Calpurnia,

98
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.300
for our elders say the barren,touched in this holy chase,

99
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.400
shake off their sterile curse.

100
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.270
I shall remember.

101
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.670
When Caesar says "Do this," itis perform'd.

102
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.900
Set on, and leave no ceremonyout.

103
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.930
Caesar!

104
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:04.770
Haaaaaaaaa!

105
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.400
Bid every noise be still!

106
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.870
Peace yet again!

107
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.400
Who is it in the press thatcalls on me?

108
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.500
I hear a tongue, shriller thanall the music, cry "Caesar."

109
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.670
Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.

110
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.830
Beware the ides of March!

111
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.300
What man is that?

112
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.870
A soothsayer bids you beware theides of March.

113
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.470
Set him before me; let me seehis face.

114
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.370
Fellow, come from the throng.

115
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.670
Look upon Caesar.

116
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.030
What say'st thou to me now?

117
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.330
Speak once again.

118
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.900
Beware the ides of March.

119
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.830
He is a dreamer; let us leavehim.

120
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.130
Pass.

121
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.170
Will you go see the order of thecourse?

122
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.270
Not I.

123
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.370
I pray you, do.

124
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.470
I am not gamesome; I do lacksome part

125
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.530
of that quick spirit that is inAntony.

126
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.500
Let me not hinder, Cassius, yourdesires; I'll leave you.

127
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:57.000
Brutus, I do observe you now oflate;

128
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.800
I have not from your eyes thatgentleness and show of love

129
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.470
as I was wont to have.

130
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.100
You bear too stubborn and toostrange a hand

131
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.570
over your friend that loves you.

132
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:11.930
Cassius, be not deceived; if Ihave veil'd my look,

133
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.130
I turn the trouble of mycountenance merely upon myself.

134
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:19.430
Vexed I am of late with passionsof some difference,

135
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.330
conceptions only proper tomyself,

136
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.670
which give some soil perhaps tomy behaviors;

137
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.470
but let not therefore my goodfriends be grieved--

138
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.530
among which number, Cassius, beyou one--

139
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.230
nor construe any further myneglect than that poor Brutus

140
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:36.830
with himself at war forgets theshows of love to other men.

141
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.500
Then, Brutus, I have muchmistook your passion,

142
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.430
by means whereof this breast ofmine

143
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.030
hath buried thoughts of greatvalue, worthy cogitations.

144
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.070
Tell me, good Brutus, can yousee your face?

145
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.200
No, Cassius, for the eye seesnot itself but by reflection,

146
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.770
by some other things.

147
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:02.070
'Tis just, and it is very muchlamented, Brutus,

148
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.300
that you have no such mirrors

149
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.530
as will turn your hiddenworthiness into your eye

150
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.530
that you may see your shadow.

151
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:11.300
I have heard where many of thebest respect in Rome,

152
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.730
except immortal Caesar,

153
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.330
speaking of Brutus and groaningunderneath this age's yoke,

154
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.170
have wish'd that noble Brutushad his eyes.

155
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.530
Into what dangers would you leadme, Cassius,

156
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.400
that you would have me seek intomyself

157
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.830
for that which is not in me?

158
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.170
Therefore, good Brutus, beprepared to hear,

159
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.700
and since you know you cannotsee yourself

160
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.930
so well as by reflection,

161
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.130
I your glass will modestlydiscover to yourself

162
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:41.770
that of yourself which you yetknow not of.

163
00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.170
and be not jealous on me, gentleBrutus;

164
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.830
were I a common laugther,

165
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.230
or did use to stale withordinary oaths

166
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.830
my love to every new protester,

167
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.030
if you know that I do fawn onmen and hug them hard

168
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.530
and after scandal them,

169
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.200
or if you know that I professmyself

170
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.370
in banqueting to all the rout,then hold me dangerous.

171
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.900
What means this shouting?

172
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.530
I do fear the people chooseCaesar for their king.

173
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.830
Ay, do you fear it?

174
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.070
Then must I think you would nothave it so.

175
00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:24.000
I would not, Cassius, yet I lovehim well.

176
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.800
Wherefore do you hold me here solong?

177
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.000
What is it that you would impartto me?

178
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.930
If it be aught toward thegeneral good,

179
00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.470
set honor in one eye and deathin the other

180
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.400
and I will look on bothindifferently.

181
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.670
Let the gods so speed me as I dolove the name of honor

182
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.930
more than I fear death.

183
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.930
I know that virtue to be in you,Brutus,

184
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.770
as well as I do know youroutward favor.

185
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:52.400
Well, honor is the subject of mystory.

186
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.070
I cannot tell what you and othermen think of this life,

187
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.670
but, for my single self, I hadas lief not be

188
00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.800
as live to be in awe of such athing as I myself.

189
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.900
I was born free as Caesar; sowere you;

190
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.070
we both have fed as well,

191
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.700
and we can both endure thewinter's cold as well as he.

192
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.770
For once, upon a raw and gustyday,

193
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.430
the troubled Tiber chafing withher shores, Caesar said to me,

194
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:22.830
"Darest thou, Cassius, now Leapin with me into this angry flood

195
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.070
and swim to yonder point?"

196
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.400
Upon the word, accoutred as Iwas,

197
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.000
I plunged in and bade himfollow.

198
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.270
So indeed he did.

199
00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:37.500
The torrent roar'd, and we didbuffet it with lusty sinews,

200
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.970
throwing it aside and stemmingit with hearts of controversy.

201
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.100
But ere we could arrive thepoint proposed,

202
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.970
Caesar cried, "Help me, Cassius,or I sink!"

203
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:53.000
I, as Aeneas our great ancestordid from the flames of Troy

204
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.200
upon his shoulder The oldAnchises bear,

205
00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.100
so from the waves of Tiber did Ithe tired Caesar.

206
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.930
And this man is now become agod,

207
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:07.570
and Cassius is a wretchedcreature and must bend his body

208
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.830
if Caesar carelessly but nod onhim.

209
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.070
He had a fever when he was inSpain,

210
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.430
and when the fit was on him, Idid mark how he did shake.

211
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.400
And 'Tis true, this god didshake;

212
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.970
His coward lips did from theircolor fly,

213
00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.130
and that same eye whose benddoth awe the world

214
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.800
did lose his luster.

215
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.300
I did hear him groan.

216
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.800
Ay, and that tongue of his thatbade the Romans mark him

217
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.900
and write his speeches in theirbooks,

218
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.570
alas, it cried, "Give me somedrink, Titinius,"

219
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.630
as a sick girl.

220
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.800
Ye gods, it doth amaze me a manof such a feeble temper

221
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.700
should so get the start of themajestic world

222
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.170
and bear the palm alone.

223
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.230
Another general shout.

224
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.530
I do believe that theseapplauses

225
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.300
are for some new honors that areheap'd on Caesar.

226
00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.330
Why, man, he doth bestride thenarrow world like a Colossus,

227
00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.330
and we petty men walk under hishuge legs and peep about

228
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.530
to find ourselves dishonorablegraves.

229
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.230
Men at some time are masters oftheir fates:

230
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:39.130
the fault, dear Brutus, is notin our stars,

231
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:44.170
But in ourselves that we areunderlings.

232
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:48.670
Brutus and Caesar: what shouldbe in that "Caesar"?

233
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.470
Why should that name be soundedmore than yours?

234
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.970
Write them together, yours is asfair a name;

235
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.930
Sound them, it doth become themouth as well;

236
00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.170
Weigh them, it is as heavy;

237
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.930
conjure with 'em, "Brutus" willstart a spirit

238
00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.030
as soon as "Caesar."

239
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.000
Now, in the names of all thegods at once,

240
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.300
Upon what meat doth this ourCaesar feed

241
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.930
that he is grown so great?

242
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.900
Oh, Age, thou art shamed!

243
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.030
Rome, thou hast lost the breedof noble bloods!

244
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.070
When went there by an age sincethe great flood

245
00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.400
but it was famed with more thanwith one man?

246
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.000
When could they say till nowthat talk'd of Rome

247
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.430
that her wide walls encompass'dbut one man?

248
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.730
Now is it Rome indeed, and roomenough,

249
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:35.830
when there is in it but one onlyman.

250
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:45.130
You and I have heard our fatherssay there was a Brutus once

251
00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.100
who would have brook'd theeternal devil

252
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:51.300
to keep his state in Rome aseasily as a king.

253
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:04.600
That you do love me, I amnothing jealous;

254
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.830
What you would work me to, Ihave some aim.

255
00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:11.200
How I have thought of this andof these times,

256
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.830
I shall recount hereafter; forthis present, I would not,

257
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:18.500
so with love I might entreatyou, be any further moved.

258
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.830
What you have said I willconsider;

259
00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.470
what you have to say I will withpatience hear,

260
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.000
and find a time both meet tohear

261
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.700
and answer such high things.

262
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.000
Till then, my noble friend, chewupon this:

263
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.070
Brutus had rather be a villager

264
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.070
than to repute himself a son ofRome under these hard conditions

265
00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.070
as this time is like to lay uponus.

266
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.730
I am glad that my weak words

267
00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.500
have struck but thus much showof fire from Brutus.

268
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.130
The games are done, and Caesaris returning.

269
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.470
As they pass by, pluck Casca bythe sleeve,

270
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.170
and he will, after his sourfashion,

271
00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.170
tell you what hath proceededworthy note today.

272
00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.470
I will do so.

273
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:07.900
But, look you, Cassius,

274
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.470
the angry spot doth glow onCaesar's brow,

275
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.200
and all the rest look like achidden train:

276
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.070
Calpurnia's cheek is pale,

277
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:17.630
and Cicero looks with suchferret and such fiery eyes

278
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.130
as we have seen him in theCapitol,

279
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.400
being cross'd in conference bysome senators.

280
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.870
Casca will tell us what thematter is.

281
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.030
Antonios.

282
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.400
Caesar?

283
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:44.600
Let me have men about me thatare fat, sleek-headed men,

284
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.000
and such as sleep o' nights:

285
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.330
yond Cassius has a lean andhungry look;

286
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:54.000
he thinks too much; such men aredangerous.

287
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.570
Fear him not, Caesar; he's notdangerous;

288
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.100
he's a noble Roman and wellgiven.

289
00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.500
Would he were fatter!

290
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:04.370
But I fear him not, yet if myname were liable to fear,

291
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.970
I do not know the man I shouldavoid so soon

292
00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.330
as that spare Cassius.

293
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.670
He reads much, he is a greatobserver,

294
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.000
and he looks quite through thedeeds of men.

295
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.170
He loves no plays, as thou dost,Antony; he hears no music;

296
00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:24.770
seldom he smiles, and smiles insuch a sort

297
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.670
as if he mock'd himself andscorn'd his spirit

298
00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:32.100
that could be moved to smile atanything.

299
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.530
Such men as he be never atheart's ease

300
00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:37.700
whiles they behold a greaterthan themselves,

301
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:42.070
and therefore are they verydangerous.

302
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:46.670
I rather tell thee what is to befear'd than what I fear,

303
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.000
for always I am Caesar.

304
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:58.530
Come on my right hand, for thisear is deaf,

305
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.230
and tell me truly what thouthink'st of him.

306
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.800
Would you speak with me?

307
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.530
Ay, Casca, tell us what hathchanced today

308
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.170
that Caesar looks so sad.

309
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.670
Why, you were with him, were younot?

310
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.070
I should not then ask Casca whathad chanced.

311
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:19.930
Why, there was a crown offeredhim, and being offered him,

312
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.930
he put it by with the back ofhis hand, thus,

313
00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.300
and then the people fellashouting.

314
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.600
What was the second noise for?

315
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.500
Why, for that too.

316
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.000
They shouted thrice.

317
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.830
What was the last cry for?

318
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.430
Why, for that too.

319
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.770
Was the crown offered himthrice?

320
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.830
Ay, marry, wast, and he put itby thrice,

321
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.900
every time gentler than other,

322
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:51.200
and at every putting by minehonest neighbors shouted.

323
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.830
Who offered him the crown?

324
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.230
Why, Antony.

325
00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.670
Tell us the manner of it, gentleCasca.

326
00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.730
I can as well be hang'd as tellthe manner of it.

327
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.770
It was mere foolery; I did notmark it.

328
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.430
I saw Mark Antony offer him acrown,

329
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:12.430
yet 'twas not a crown neither;'twas one of these coronets.

330
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.430
And, as I told you, he put it byonce.

331
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.070
But for all that,

332
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.930
to my thinking, he would fainhave had it.

333
00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.570
Then he offered it to him again;then he put it by again.

334
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:28.100
But, to my thinking, he was veryloath to lay his fingers off it.

335
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.570
And then he offered it the thirdtime;

336
00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.570
he put it the third time by;

337
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.700
and still as he refused it, therabblement hooted

338
00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.030
and clapped their chopped hands

339
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.570
and threw up their sweatynightcaps

340
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.530
and uttered such a deal ofstinking breath

341
00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.030
because Caesar refused the crown

342
00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:44.770
that it had almost chokedCaesar,

343
00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.600
for he swounded and fell down atit.

344
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.770
And for mine own part, I durstnot laugh

345
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.030
for fear of opening my lips andreceiving the bad air.

346
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.830
But, soft, I pray you, what, didCaesars wound?

347
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.000
He fell down in the marketplace

348
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.670
and foamed at mouth and wasspeechless.

349
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.270
'Tis very like.

350
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.700
He hath the falling sickness.

351
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.430
No, Caesar hath it not, but youand I and honest Casca,

352
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:09.330
we have the falling sickness.

353
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.830
I know not what you mean bythat,

354
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.030
but I am sure Caesar fell down.

355
00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:17.270
If the tagrag people did notclap him and hiss him

356
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.600
according as he pleased anddispleased them,

357
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.630
as they use to do the players inthe theatre, I am no true man.

358
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.370
What said he when he came untohimself?

359
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.700
Marry, before he fell down, whenhe perceived

360
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.630
the common herd was glad herefused the crown,

361
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.830
he plucked me ope his doublet

362
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.000
and offered them his throat tocut.

363
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.930
And I'd been a man of anyoccupation,

364
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:39.270
if I had not taken him at aword,

365
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.230
I would I might go to hell amongthe rogues.

366
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.770
And so he fell.

367
00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.830
And when he came to himselfagain,

368
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:49.200
he said, if he had done or saidanything amiss,

369
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.900
he desired their worships tothink it was his infirmity.

370
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.700
Three or four wenches where Istood cried, "Alas, good soul!"

371
00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.830
and forgave him with all theirhearts.

372
00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.670
But there's no heed to be takenof them;

373
00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.700
if Caesar had stabbed theirmothers,

374
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.070
they would have done no less.

375
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.730
And after that he came, thussad, away?

376
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.830
Ay.

377
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.000
Did Cicero say anything?

378
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.470
Ay, he spoke Greek.

379
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.070
To what effect?

380
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.170
Nay, an I tell you that,

381
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:15.500
I'll ne'er look you i' the faceagain;

382
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.900
but those that understood himsmiled at one another

383
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.470
and shook their heads;

384
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.900
but for mine own part, it wasGreek to me.

385
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.670
I could tell you more news too:

386
00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.300
Marullus and Flavius,

387
00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.500
for pulling scarfs off Caesar'simages,

388
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.000
are put to silence.

389
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.170
Fare you well.

390
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.730
There was more foolery yet, if Icould remember it.

391
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.930
Will you sup with me tonight,Casca?

392
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.170
No, I am promised forth.

393
00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.670
Then will you dine with metomorrow?

394
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:55.730
Ay, if I be alive, and your mindhold,

395
00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:57.530
and your dinner worth theeating.

396
00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:59.070
Good, I will expect you.

397
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.300
Do so.

398
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.400
Farewell, both.

399
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.570
What a blunt fellow is thisgrown to be.

400
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.530
He was quick mettle when he wentto school.

401
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:14.230
So is he now in execution of anybold or noble enterprise.

402
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.430
However, he puts on this tardyform.

403
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.600
This rudeness is a sauce to hisgood wit,

404
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.730
which gives men stomach todigest his words

405
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:22.900
with better appetite.

406
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.130
And so it is.

407
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.730
For this time I will leave you.

408
00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.530
Tomorrow, if you please to speakwith me,

409
00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.900
I will come home to you, or, ifyou will, come home to me

410
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.000
and I will wait for you.

411
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.230
I will do so.

412
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:39.270
Till then...think of the world.

413
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:50.630
Well, Brutus, thou art noble;yet, I see thy honorable mettle

414
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.870
may be wrought from that it isdisposed;

415
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:56.030
therefore it is meet that nobleminds

416
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.470
keep ever with their likes;

417
00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:02.330
For who so firm that cannot beseduced?

418
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:09.100
Caesar doth bear me hard, but heloves Brutus.

419
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:13.130
If I were Brutus now and he wereCassius, he should not humor me.

420
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:18.800
I will this night, in severalhands, in at his windows throw,

421
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.770
as if they came from severalcitizens, writings,

422
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:25.300
all tending to the great opinionthat Rome holds of his name,

423
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:30.630
wherein obscurely Caesar'sambition shall be glanced at.

424
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:33.300
And after this let Caesar seathim sure;

425
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:40.800
for we will shake him, or worsedays endure.

426
00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.130
Good even, Casca.

427
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.570
Brought you Caesar home?

428
00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.300
Why are you breathless, and whystare you so?

429
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:16.070
Are not you moved, when all thesway of eart

430
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.500
shakes like a thing unfirm?

431
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.070
O Cicero, I have seen tempests

432
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.630
when the scolding winds haverived the knotty oaks,

433
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.900
and I have seen the ambitiousocean swell and rage and foam

434
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:31.400
to be exalted with thethreatening clouds,

435
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.670
but never till tonight, nevertill now,

436
00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.100
did I go through a tempestdropping fire.

437
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.600
Either there is a civil strifein heaven,

438
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.000
or else the world too saucy withthe gods

439
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.730
incenses them to senddestruction.

440
00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:52.930
Why, saw you anything orewonderful?

441
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.430
A common slave-- you know himwell by sight--

442
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.530
held up his left hand,

443
00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:01.830
which did flame and burn liketwenty torches join'd,

444
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:07.630
and yet his hand not sensible offire remain'd unscorch'd.

445
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:11.670
Besides, I ha' not since put upmy sword.

446
00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:16.630
Against the Capitol I met alion, who glaz'd upon me

447
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.700
and went surly by withoutannoying me.

448
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.470
And there were drawn upon a heapa hundred ghastly women

449
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.270
transformed with their fear, whoswore they saw men all in fire

450
00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:29.470
walk up and down the streets.

451
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:46.430
And yesterday the bird of nightdid sit even at noonday

452
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:50.570
upon the marketplace, hootingand shrieking.

453
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.170
When these prodigies do soconjointly meet,

454
00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.030
let not men say "These are theirreasons; they are natural":

455
00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:58.370
For I believe they areportentous things

456
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.700
unto the climate that they pointupon.

457
00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:05.800
Indeed, it is a strange-disposedtime.

458
00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:14.300
But men may construe thingsafter their fashion,

459
00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.330
clean from the purpose of thethings themselves.

460
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.500
Comes Caesar to the Capitoltomorrow?

461
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.870
He doth, for he did bid Antoniossend word to you

462
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:27.030
he would be there tomorrow.

463
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.370
Goodbye then, Casca.

464
00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:36.370
This disturbed sky is not towalk in.

465
00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:38.130
Farewell, Cicero.

466
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.700
Who's there?

467
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.800
A Roman.

468
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.830
Casca, by your voice.

469
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.770
Your ear is good.

470
00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:58.230
Cassius, what night is this!

471
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.570
A very pleasing night to honestmen.

472
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:02.800
Who ever knew the heavens menaceso?

473
00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.070
Those that have known the earthso full of faults.

474
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:08.270
For my part, I have walk'd aboutthe streets,

475
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.200
submitting me unto the perilousnight,

476
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.230
and thus unbraced, Casca, as yousee,

477
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:14.300
have bared my bosom to thethunderstone;

478
00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.130
and when the cross bluelightning

479
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:18.470
seem'd to open the breast ofheaven,

480
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.270
I did present myself even in theaim and very flash of it.

481
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:24.970
But wherefore did you so muchtempt the heavens?

482
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:28.070
It is the part of men to fearand tremble

483
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.470
when the most mighty gods bytokens

484
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:33.030
send such dreadful heralds toastonish us.

485
00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.670
You are dull, Casca,

486
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.600
and those sparks of life thatshould be in a Roman

487
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.900
you do want, or else you usenot.

488
00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.570
You look pale and gaze and puton fear

489
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.470
and cast yourself in wonder

490
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.800
to see the strange impatience ofthe heavens.

491
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:55.700
But if you would consider thetrue cause why all these fires,

492
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.100
why all these gliding ghosts,

493
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.070
why birds and beasts fromquality and kind,

494
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:05.530
why old men, fools, and childrencalculate,

495
00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:08.400
Why all these things change fromtheir ordinance,

496
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:14.700
their natures, and preformedfaculties to monstrous quality,

497
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:19.030
why, you shall find that heavenhath infused them

498
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.870
with these spirits to make theminstruments of fear and warning

499
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.800
unto some monstrous state.

500
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.130
Now could I, Casca,

501
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.470
name to thee a man most likethis dreadful night,

502
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.470
that thunders, lightens, opensgraves,

503
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:33.370
and roars as doth the lion inthe Capitol,

504
00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:37.100
a man no mightier than thyselfor me in personal action,

505
00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.300
yet prodigious grown andfearful,

506
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.000
as these strange eruptions are.

507
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.770
'Tis Caesar that you mean, is itnot, Cassius?

508
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:46.230
Let it be who it is,

509
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:50.130
for Romans now have thews andlimbs like to their ancestors.

510
00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:51.900
But, woe the while!

511
00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.370
Our fathers' minds are dead,

512
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.170
and we are govern'd with ourmothers' spirits;

513
00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:00.370
our yoke and sufferance show uswomanish.

514
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:03.570
Indeed they say the senatorstomorrow

515
00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:06.400
mean to establish Caesar as aking,

516
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.900
and he shall wear his crown bysea and land

517
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.900
in every place save here inItaly.

518
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.570
I know where I will wear thisdagger then:

519
00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:22.000
Cassius from bondage willdeliver Cassius.

520
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.500
Therein, ye gods, you make theweak most strong;

521
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.130
therein, ye gods, you tyrants dodefeat.

522
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:31.870
Nor stony tower, nor walls ofbeaten brass,

523
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.170
nor airless dungeon, nor stronglinks of iron

524
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.430
can be retentive to the strengthof spirit;

525
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.830
but life, being weary of theseworldly bars,

526
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:42.100
never lacks power to dismissitself.

527
00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.130
If I know this, know all theworld besides,

528
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.070
that part of tyranny that I dobear

529
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.630
I can shake off at pleasure.

530
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:50.000
So can I.

531
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.800
So every bondman in his own hand

532
00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.970
bears the power to cancel hiscaptivity.

533
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:58.770
And why should Caesar be atyrant then?

534
00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.670
Poor man.

535
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:01.870
I know he would not be a wolf

536
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:03.970
but that he sees the Romans arebut sheep.

537
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:06.970
He were no lion, were not Romanshinds.

538
00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:09.570
Those that with haste will makea mighty fire

539
00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:11.270
begin it with weak straws.

540
00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:15.430
What trash is Rome, whatrubbish, and what offal,

541
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.870
when it serves for the basematter

542
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:20.900
to illuminate so vile a thing asCaesar?

543
00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.970
Grief, where hast thou led me?

544
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:30.530
I perhaps speak this before awilling bondman;

545
00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:33.500
then I know my answer must bemade.

546
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:38.270
But I am arm'd, and dangers areto me indifferent.

547
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.070
You speak to Casca,

548
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.770
and to such a man that is nofleering tell-tale.

549
00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.370
Hold my hand.

550
00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:48.630
Be factious for redress of allthese griefs,

551
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:50.030
and I will set this foot of mine

552
00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:51.300
as far as who goes farthest.

553
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.030
Ay, there's a bargain made.

554
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:57.330
Now know you, Casca, I havemoved already

555
00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:59.330
some certain of thenoblest-minded Romans

556
00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:00.670
to undergo with me an enterprise

557
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:02.670
of honorable, dangerousconsequence;

558
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.170
and I do know by this, they stayfor me in Pompey's Porch.

559
00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:11.130
For now, this fearful night,

560
00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:12.830
there is no stir or walking inthe streets,

561
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.970
and the complexion of theelement in favor's

562
00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:16.930
like the work we have in hand,

563
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:19.930
most bloody, fiery, and mostterrible.

564
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:22.100
Stand close awhile, for herecomes one in haste.

565
00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.430
'Tis Cinna, I do know him by hisgait; he is a friend.

566
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:26.700
Cinna, where haste you so?

567
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.970
To find out you.

568
00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:29.430
Who's that?

569
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:30.630
Metellus Cimber?

570
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:34.600
No, it is Casca, one incorporateto our attempts.

571
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.200
Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?

572
00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.600
I am glad on't.

573
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.870
What a fearful night is this!

574
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:43.330
There's two or three of us haveseen strange sights.

575
00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:44.530
Am I not stay'd for?

576
00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:45.630
Tell me.

577
00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:46.900
Yes, you are.

578
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:51.400
O Cassius, if you could but winthe noble Brutus to our party--

579
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.530
Be you content.

580
00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:54.970
Good Cinna, take this paper,

581
00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.670
and look you lay it in thepraetor's chair,

582
00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:00.100
where Brutus may but find it;and throw this in at his window;

583
00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.170
set this up with wax upon oldBrutus' statue.

584
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.600
All this done, repair toPompey's Porch,

585
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.700
where you shall find us.

586
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.670
Is Decius Brutus and Treboniusthere?

587
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:08.970
All but Metellus Cimber,

588
00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:10.970
and he's gone to seek you atyour house.

589
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.270
Well, I will hie and so bestowthese papers as you bade me.

590
00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.600
That done, repair to Pompey'sTheatre.

591
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.530
Come, Casca, you and I will yetere day see Brutus at his house.

592
00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:24.130
Three parts of him is oursalready,

593
00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:26.700
and the man entire on the nextencounter yields him ours.

594
00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.300
O, he sits high in all thepeople's hearts,

595
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.770
and that which would appearoffense in us,

596
00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:34.530
His countenance, like richestalchemy,

597
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.470
will change to virtue and toworthiness.

598
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:38.800
Him and his worth and our greatneed of him

599
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.330
you have right well conceited.

600
00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:43.830
Let us go, for it is aftermidnight,

601
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:46.670
and ere day we will awake himand be sure of him.

602
00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.900
