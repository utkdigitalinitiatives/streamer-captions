00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:48.770


2
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.730
Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour draws on apace.

3
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.870
Four happy days bring in another moon,

4
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.830
but oh, methinks, how slow this old moon wanes.

5
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.030
She lingers my desires like to a step-dame or a dowager

6
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.730
long withering out a young man's revenue.

7
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.070
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night.

8
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.930
Four nights will quickly dream away the time.

9
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.000
Then the moon, like to a silver bow new bent in heaven,

10
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.500
shall behold the night of our solemnities.

11
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.600
Go, Philostrate, stir up the Athenian youth to merriments.

12
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.200
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.

13
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.130
Turn melancholy forth to funerals.

14
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.430
The pale companion is not for our pomp.

15
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.470
Hippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword

16
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.270
and won thy love doing the injuries.

17
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.730
But I will wed thee in another key,

18
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:58.070
with pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.

19
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.970
Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke.

20
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.100
Thanks, good Egeus.

21
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.070
What's the news with thee?

22
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.530
Full of vexation come I

23
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.500
with complaint against my child, my daughter Hermia.

24
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.870
My noble lord, this man, Demetrius, hath my consent to marry her.

25
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.070
And, my gracious Duke, this man, Lysander,

26
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.430
hath bewitched the bosom of my child.

27
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.270
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou has given her rhymes

28
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.270
and interchanged love tokens with my child.

29
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.070
Thou hast by moonlight at her window

30
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.830
sung with feigning voice verses of feigning love

31
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.400
and stolen the impression of her fantasy.

32
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.470
With cunning hath thou filched my daughter's heart,

33
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.330
turned her obedience, which is due to me,

34
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.130
to stubborn harshness.

35
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.070
And, my gracious Duke, be it so she will not here before your grace

36
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.800
consent to marry with Demetrius,

37
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.270
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens.

38
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.230
As she is mine, I may dispose of her,

39
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.900
which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death,

40
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.070
according to our law immediately provided in that case.

41
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.330
What says thou, Hermia?

42
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.830
Be advised, fair maid: To you, your father should be as a god,

43
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.800
one that composed your beauties,

44
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.900
yea, and one to whom you are but as a form in wax

45
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.070
by him imprinted and within his power

46
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.270
to leave the figure or disfigure it.

47
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.370
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.

48
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.600
So is Lysander.

49
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.870
In himself, he is.

50
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.570
But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,

51
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.500
the other must be held to be the worthier.

52
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.100
I would my father looked but with my eyes.

53
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.170
Rather, your eyes must with his judgment look.

54
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.330
I do entreat your grace to pardon me.

55
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.770
I know not by what power I am made bold,

56
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.930
nor how it may concern my modesty

57
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.000
in such a presence here to plead my thoughts,

58
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.800
but I beseech your grace that I may know

59
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.930
the worst that may befall me in this case

60
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.070
if I refuse to wed Demetrius.

61
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.700
Either to die the death

62
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.730
or to abjure forever the society of men.

63
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.900
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,

64
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.370
know of your youth, examine well your blood,

65
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.070
whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,

66
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.630
you can endure the livery of a nun,

67
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.900
for aye to be in shady cloister mewed,

68
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.300
to live a barren sister all your life,

69
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.570
chanting faint hymns to the cold, fruitless moon.

70
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.670
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,

71
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.930
to undergo such maiden pilgrimage,

72
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.770
but earthlier happy is the rose distilled

73
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.600
than that which withering on the virgin thorn grows,

74
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.900
lives, and dies in single blessedness.

75
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.870
So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord.

76
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.970
Ere I will yield my virgin patent up unto his lordship,

77
00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.500
whose unwished yoke my soul consents not to give sovereignty.

78
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.800
Take time to pause, and, by the next new moon--

79
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.830
the sealing-day betwixt my love and me

80
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.070
for everlasting bond of fellowship--

81
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.600
upon that day, either prepare to die

82
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.470
for disobedience to your father's will

83
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.300
or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,

84
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.630
or on Diana's altar to protest

85
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.000
for aye austerity and single life.

86
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.300
Relent, sweet Hermia.

87
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.030
And, Lysander, yield thy crazed title to my certain right.

88
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.230
You have her father's love, Demetrius.

89
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.930
Let me have Hermia's.

90
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.630
Do you marry him?

91
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.500
Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love.

92
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.000
And what is mine my love shall render him.

93
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.330
And she is mine, and all my right of her

94
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.870
I do estate unto Demetrius.

95
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.100
I am, my lord, as well derived as he,

96
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.370
as well possessed.

97
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.800
My love is more than his.

98
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.830
My fortunes every way as fairly ranked,

99
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.270
if not with vantage, as Demetrius'.

100
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.030
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,

101
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.430
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia.

102
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.800
Why should not I then prosecute my right?

103
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.570
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,

104
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.500
made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,

105
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.900
and won her soul.

106
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.000
And she, sweet lady, dotes, devoutly dotes,

107
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.300
dotes in idolatry, upon this spotted and inconstant man.

108
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.300
I must confess that I have heard as much,

109
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.630
and with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof,

110
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.500
but, being over-full of self-affairs,

111
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.270
my mind did lose it.

112
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.930
But, Demetrius, come.

113
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.200
And come, Egeus, you shall go with me.

114
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.130
I have some private schooling for you both.

115
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.900
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself

116
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.630
to fit your fancies to your father's will,

117
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.700
or else the law of Athens yields you up--

118
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.900
which by no means we may extenuate--

119
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.800
to death or to a vow of single life.

120
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.100
How now, my love?

121
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.800
Why is your cheek so pale?

122
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.070
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?

123
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.770
Belike for want of rain, which I could well beteem them

124
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.630
from the tempest of my eyes.

125
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.000
Ay me.

126
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.130
For aught that I could ever read,

127
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.930
could ever hear by tale or history,

128
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.930
the course of true love never did run smooth.

129
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.330
But, either it was different in blood--

130
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.530
Oh cross,

131
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.330
too high to be enthralled too low.

132
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.400
Or else misgraffed in respect of years.

133
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.630
Oh, spite.

134
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.830
Too old to be engaged to young.

135
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.870
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends.

136
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.170
Oh, hell.

137
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.800
To choose love by another's eyes.

138
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.130
Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,

139
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.700
war, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,

140
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.700
making it momentary as a sound,

141
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.100
swift as a shadow, short as any dream,

142
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.770
brief as the lightning in the collied night.

143
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.300
Ere a man hath power to say "Behold,"

144
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.270
the jaws of darkness do devour it up,

145
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.670
So quick bright things come to confusion.

146
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.500
If then true lovers have been ever crossed,

147
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.530
it stands as an edict in destiny.

148
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.370
let us teach our trial patience,

149
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.500
because it is a customary cross

150
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:38.670
as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,

151
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:44.570
wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.

152
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.970
A good persuasion.

153
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.800
Therefore, hear me, Hermia.

154
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.830
I have a widow aunt, a dowager of great revenue,

155
00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.130
and she hath no child.

156
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.300
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues.

157
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.100
And she respects me as her only son.

158
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.330
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee,

159
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.770
And to that place the sharp Athenian law cannot pursue us.

160
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.600
If thou lovest me then,

161
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.970
steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night,

162
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.930
and in the wood, a league without the town,

163
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.770
where I did meet thee once with Helena

164
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.570
to do observance to a morn of May,

165
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.970
there will I stay for thee.

166
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.100
My good Lysander.

167
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.470
I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,

168
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.570
by his best arrow with the golden head,

169
00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.900
by the simplicity of Venus' doves,

170
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.270
by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,

171
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.800
and by that fire which burned the Carthage queen,

172
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.870
when the false Troyan under sail was seen,

173
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.400
by all the vows that ever men have broke,

174
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.830
in number more than ever woman spoke.

175
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.270
At that same place thou hast appointed me,

176
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.270
tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.

177
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.770
God speed, fair Helena.

178
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.670
Call you me fair?

179
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.270
That fair again unsay.

180
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.300
Demetrius loves your fair.

181
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.230
Oh, happy fair.

182
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.930
Your eyes are lodestars,

183
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.530
and your tongue's sweet air more tunable

184
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.400
than lark to shepherd's ear when wheat is green,

185
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.500
when hawthorn buds appear.

186
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.730
Sickness is catching.

187
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:37.930
Oh, were favour so,

188
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.130
yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.

189
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:44.130
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,

190
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.000
my tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.

191
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.570
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,

192
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.200
the rest I'd give to be to you translated.

193
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.070
Oh, teach me how you look

194
00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:00.730
and with what art you sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.

195
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.830
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.

196
00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.770
Oh that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill.

197
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.130
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.

198
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.570
Oh, that my prayers could such affection move.

199
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.900
The more I hate, the more he follows me.

200
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.800
The more I love, the more he hateth me.

201
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.530
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.

202
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.400
None but your beauty.

203
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.670
Oh, would that fault were mine.

204
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.100
Take comfort. He no more shall see my face.

205
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.970
Lysander and myself shall fly this place.

206
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.830
Before the time I did Lysander see,

207
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.600
seemed Athens as a paradise to me.

208
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.130
Oh, then, what graces in my love do dwell

209
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.600
that he hath turned a heaven unto a hell.

210
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.600
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold.

211
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:51.330
Tomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold

212
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.670
her silver visage in the watery glass,

213
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:57.000
decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,

214
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.830
a time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,

215
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.330
through Athens' gates we have devised to steal.

216
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:04.600
And in that wood,

217
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.430
where often you and I upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,

218
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.500
emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,

219
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.230
there my Lysander and myself shall meet

220
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.470
and thence from Athens turn away our eyes

221
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:19.370
to seek new friends and stranger companies.

222
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.870
Farewell, sweet playfellow.

223
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.130
Pray thou for us.

224
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.170
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius.

225
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.030
How happy some o'er other some can be.

226
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:39.500
Through Athens, I am thought as fair as she.

227
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.700
But what of that?

228
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.730
Demetrius thinks not so.

229
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.100
He will not know what all but he do know.

230
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.230
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,

231
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.230
so I, admiring of his qualities.

232
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.300
Things base and vile, holding no quantity

233
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.900
love can transpose to form and dignity.

234
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.730
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,

235
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.570
and therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.

236
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.600
Nor hath love's mind of any judgment taste.

237
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.730
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.

238
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.970
And therefore is love said to be a child,

239
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.700
because in choice, he is so oft beguiled.

240
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.370
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,

241
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:21.230
so the boy Love is perjured everywhere.

242
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.100
For ere Demetrius looked on Hermia's eyne,

243
00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.630
he hailed down oaths that he was only mine.

244
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:37.800
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,

245
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:42.170
so he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.

246
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.800
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight,

247
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.630
then to the wood will he tomorrow night pursue her.

248
00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.400
And for this intelligence if I have thanks,

249
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.800
it is a dear expense.

250
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.700
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,

251
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.000
to have his sight thither and back again.

252
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.830
Is all our company here?

253
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.670
You would best to call them generally,

254
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.630
man by man, according to the script.

255
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.970
Here is the scroll of every man's name

256
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.930
which is thought fit, through all Athens,

257
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.870
to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess

258
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.600
on his wedding day at night.

259
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.100
First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on,

260
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.270
then read the names of the actors and so grow to a point.

261
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.870
Marry, our play is the most lamentable comedy

262
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.130
and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe.

263
00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.870
A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry.

264
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.670
Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll.

265
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.070
Masters, spread yourselves.

266
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.170
Answer as I call you.

267
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.370
Nick Bottom, the weaver.

268
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.600
Ready.

269
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.270
Name what part I am for and proceed.

270
00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.300
You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.

271
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.870
What is Pyramus, a lover, or a tyrant?

272
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.530
A lover that kills himself most gallant for love.

273
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.000
That will ask some tears in the true performing of it.

274
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.430
If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes.

275
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.130
I will move storms.

276
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.270
I will condole in some measure.

277
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.700
To the rest.

278
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.370
Yet my chief humour is for a tyrant.

279
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.270
I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in,

280
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.800
to make all split.

281
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.670
The raging rocks and shivering shocks

282
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.630
shall break the locks of prison gates.

283
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.730
And Phibbus' car shall shine from far

284
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:33.630
and make and mar the foolish fates.

285
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.970
This was lofty.

286
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.470
Now name the rest of the players.

287
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.300
This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein.

288
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.530
A lover is more condoling.

289
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.270
Francis Flute, the bellows-maker.

290
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.370
Here, Peter Quince.

291
00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:45.200
Flute, you must take Thisbe on you.

292
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.700
What is Thisbe, a wandering knight?

293
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.000
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.

294
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.230
Nay, faith, let not me play a woman.

295
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.330
I have a beard coming.

296
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.570
That's all one.

297
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:57.800
You shall play it in a mask.

298
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.730
And you may speak as small as you will.

299
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:00.900
And I may hide my face.

300
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.270
Let me play Thisbe too.

301
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.130
I'll speak in a monstrous little voice.

302
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.670
"Thisne, Thisne."

303
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.670
"Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear."

304
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.270
"Thy Thisbe dear, and lady dear."

305
00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.930
No, no, no, you must play Pyramus,

306
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.600
and, Flute, you Thisbe.

307
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.600
Well, proceed.

308
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.270
Robin Starveling, the tailor.

309
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.000
Here, Peter Quince.

310
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.770
Robin Starveling, you must play...

311
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.130
Thisbe's mother.

312
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:28.730
Tom Snout, the tinker.

313
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:29.830
Here, Peter Quince.

314
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:30.930
You, Pyramus' father.

315
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.330
and myself, Thisbe's father.

316
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.470
Oh, and Snug the joiner, you, the lion's part.

317
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.330
And, I hope, here is a play fitted.

318
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.030
Have you the lion's part written?

319
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.470
Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.

320
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.530
You may do it extempore, for it's nothing but roaring.

321
00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:50.970
Let me play the lion too.

322
00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.200
I will roar that it will do any man good to hear me.

323
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.130
I will roar that it will make the duke say,

324
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.970
"Let him roar again. Let him roar again!"

325
00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.600
And you should do it too terribly,

326
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.730
you would fright the duchess and the ladies that they would shriek.

327
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.400
And that were enough to hang us all.

328
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.270
That would hang us, every mother's son.

329
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.370
I grant you, friends,

330
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.670
if you should fright the ladies out of their wits,

331
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.970
they would have no more discretion but to hang us,

332
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.300
but I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you

333
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.730
as gently as any sucking dove.

334
00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.670
I will roar you an 'twere any nightingale.

335
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.270
You can play no part but Pyramus,

336
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.470
for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man,

337
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.730
a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's day,

338
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.230
a most lovely gentleman-like man.

339
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.330
Therefore you must needs play Pyramus.

340
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.230
Well, I will undertake it.

341
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.630
Masters, here are your parts.

342
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.700
And I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you

343
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.230
to con them by tomorrow night

344
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.530
and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight.

345
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.470
There will we rehearse,

346
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:07.170
for if we meet in the city, we will be dogged with company,

347
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.870
and our devices known.

348
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.330
In the meantime, I will draw a bill of properties,

349
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:12.770
such as our play wants.

350
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.270
I pray you, fail me not.

351
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.770
We will meet,

352
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:20.830
and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously.

353
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:23.500
Take pains; Be perfect.

354
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:25.970
Adieu.

355
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.200
Hold or cut bow-strings.

356
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.370
