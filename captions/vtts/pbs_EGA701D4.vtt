00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.700
[horse neighing]

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.430
Actor as Louverture I am
Toussaint Louverture.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.000
My name is perhaps known to you.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.800
[Narrator] He was called the
black George Washington.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.360
He fought off three empires
and enraged Napoleon.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.500
[Louverture] The prospect
of a black republic

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.160
is equally disturbing
to the Spanish,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.300
the English, and
the Americans.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.260
[Narrator] He championed
liberty and egalite for all.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.200
Toussaint Louverture and
the Haitian Revolution.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.400
[Announcer] This program
was made possible

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.330
by the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.060
and by contributions
to your PBS station

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:58.930
from viewers like you.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.130
as the poorest country in
the Western Hemisphere.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.200
But during its height
at Saint-Domingue

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.000
it was the richest
place in the Americas.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.300
The thing about it, though,
is that its richness

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.760
was all rooted in slaves.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.030
Its wealth was based
on human capital,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.600
on owning that human capital.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.730
All day, as long as
the sun is shining,

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.360
the men are bending over

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:32.760
and swaying a machete at
the foot of the sugarcane.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.660
The world, as you
knew it, disappeared.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.000
Therefore, you
become an animal

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.300
and you expect to
live like an animal.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.730
[no audible dialogue]

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.760
[Woman] The dominion of the
master had to be absolute,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.330
but that absoluteness
itself made the master

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.800
into something other
than human as well.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.730
Liberty, equality,
fraternity--

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.860
that was new for the world.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.830
Toussaint Louverture is
the epitome of humanity.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.600
He realized early on that
the condition he was in

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.760
was totally insufferable.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.400
recruited about 3,000
to 4,000 people,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.730
trained them, and they fought

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.760
the French, the British,
and the Spanish armies

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.000
for 12 years.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.330
They burned the mechanisms
of their production--

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.860
they're burning the
plantation fields,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.730
burning down the houses.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.260
It was a wholesale massacre

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.700
on a really, really
enormous scale.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.900
It was big, big
major payback time.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.160
The Haitian Revolution

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.630
is probably the most
profound revolution

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.230
ever realized by human beings.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.760
The only place where
slaves created a nation,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.660
but nobody wants
to talk about it.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:20.830
Aah!

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.300
[gunfire] [horses neighing]

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.230
[Narrator] In the
summer of 1789,

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.230
when Haiti was still
the dormant colony
of Saint-Domingue,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.430
it was France that grabbed
the world's attention.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.100
Parisian mobs rioted
against the French king

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.760
and against their own
desperate poverty.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.800
Chanting slogans for liberty,
equality, and brotherhood,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.200
they sparked the revolution
that would fill history books

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.030
for centuries to come.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.460
The trick about the
French Revolution

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.630
was that it meant a
lot of different things

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.230
to a lot of different people.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.260
[crowd cheering]

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.030
In the streets of Paris,
the French Revolution

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.960
meant an end to the appalling
privileges of wealth.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.300
In France's
brand-new congress,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.030
called the National Assembly,

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.900
it meant the ideas of Europe's
most radical thinkers

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.500
could be realized.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.360
Nobody knows exactly what's
going to come out of it,

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.230
but just the idea of
having rights-- right?--

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.500
the idea that all
people have rights,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.900
that those rights are inherent.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.930
This was something
that obviously

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.430
philosophers had
written about before,

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.130
but during the course of
the French Revolution,

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.530
it was written down
in a text called

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.630
The Declaration of
the Rights of Man.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.900
[Man] It's a dangerous idea

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.260
because the society is
based on inequality.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.960
That's what makes it work.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.300
Because it was not supposed
to work for everybody.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.200
It was supposed to
work for a minority.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.230
What was a dangerous
idea in France

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.600
was even more dangerous in
its slave-holding colonies

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.430
off the coast of Florida--

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.230
Martinique, Guadeloupe,
and an island known

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.960
as the Pearl of the Antilles.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.400
Today, the western
half is Haiti.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:21.300
Then, it was the French
colony of Saint-Domingue.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.060
One thing that's fascinating
about that time--

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.200
people think these things
were very far away.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.230
They were not.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.960
News traveled very, very fast.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.700
[Man] We have to
remember that the ocean

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.300
was like a highway
in the 18th century.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.900
I mean, the ships
were constantly

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.930
bringing news back and forth.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.800
Everyone was obsessed with news.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.100
Sailors would come
off the ships,

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.600
the people they would
work with as they were
unloading the ships,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.630
were enslaved people,
so there are reports

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.230
who were describing
the events of--

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.230
that had been going on
in Paris to the enslaved

00:05:53.230 --> 00:06:01.900
that are working
alongside of them.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.330
Few intended colonial slaves

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.300
should take democratic
ideas to heart.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.230
Far too much was at stake.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.660
Sugar greased the wheels of
the 18th century economy,

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.200
and Saint-Domingue
was the sugar capital

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:36.230
of the world.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.230
It was easy, even for
France's political radicals,

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:52.430
to ignore the agony that
made it all possible.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.030
The leaves of the sugarcane

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.260
are just like miniscule saws.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.500
If they cut you, you
may not even see it.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.030
But when you perspire,

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.300
the sweat gets in
it and it burns.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.500
In the roots there are ants.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.630
They bite.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:22.360
you will scratch
yourself for half a day.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.630
If the worker refused to work,

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.500
well, there is a law
where you just shoot him.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.960
That's all.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.230
The whole concept
of slavery itself

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.500
is a totally savage one.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.160
The French,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.730
they brought it down to science.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.130
A slave coming from Africa
would not last three years,

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.530
the way the system
was organized.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:52.130
They had it down to
that kind of statistics.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.800
They did it very
systematically,

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.660
and it was very successful.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.630
[no audible dialogue]

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.760
Slavery in Saint-Domingue
succeeded, too,

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.800
on a foundation of
relentless terror.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.500
Slave owner Stanislas
Saint Fo ches

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:17.630
explained it as
rational management.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.860
[Actor as Fo ches]
Slow punishments

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:24.930
make a greater impression
than quick or violent ones.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:29.530
Rather than 50 lashes
administered in 5 minutes,

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.500
25 lashes of the whip

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.600
administered in a
quarter of an hour.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:42.260
This is far more likely
to make an impression.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.800
[Man] The accounts
about the tortures

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.260
inflicted on slaves
are often horrifying--

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.200
legs cut off or arms cut off,
amputations for runaways,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:57.700
rubbing hot powder or pepper
and so forth into the wounds.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:07.000
Slaves actually hung
and left to die.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.530
You can kind of imagine
that this kind of a world

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:13.430
in which, essentially, human
life was given so little value

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.460
that these tortures
were kind of refined

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.330
to this incredible cruel effect.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.760
Despite the brutal
tools of control,

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.930
some blacks managed
to escape slavery.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:30.530
Many had been born free,
fathered by white planters.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.630
Others had gained freedom

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.330
through their own
wits or talents.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:41.960
One such man was
Toussaint Louverture.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.130
[Louverture] I
was born a slave,

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:50.800
but nature gave me the
soul of a free man.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.600
Toussaint Louverture was
a very determined man,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.700
he was a very ambitious man,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:04.530
and, in my opinion,
he was a genius.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.960
Toussaint is, I think,

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.160
one of the most
incredible figures

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.260
that I know about in many ways.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.700
He's born on a plantation
in Saint-Domingue.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.600
He grows up on that plantation.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.000
That plantation
was owned by a man

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.860
who was tolerant for the times.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.360
Toussaint was taught to
read and write as a child.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.330
[no audible dialogue]

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:32.400
He eventually occupies a
somewhat privileged role,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.960
if you can say that on a
plantation, as a coachman,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:39.060
and has a kind of
relationship with the managers
and masters, in some ways.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.230
He becomes free in the 1770s,

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.060
so he's somebody
who kind of occupied

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.600
And I think that's the key
for understanding Toussaint,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:53.960
is that he saw possibilities
where other people didn't.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.900
[Man] He had businesses,
had contacts in the U.S.,

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.360
and elsewhere, bank accounts.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.000
He managed his
affairs pretty well.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.660
The man was endless in
organizational capacity.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.300
I mean, he would have been
a fantastic CEO today.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:14.600
[chatter]

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.500
Toussaint didn't record
his first reactions

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.430
to the revolution in France,

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.060
but his fellow free
Saint-Dominguans,

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.300
the white colonials,

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.030
and the mixed-raced population

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.500
were transfixed.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.830
In 1799, there were about
40,000 white people

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.500
and about 30,000 colored
people who were--

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.630
of course, their sons and
cousins and so on and so forth

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.900
who were landowners
themselves,

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.000
many of them
slave-owners themselves,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.360
many of them very
effective businessmen,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.860
many of them involved
romantically

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.730
with the white master class.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.530
One of the things
that's important

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.400
to remember about Haiti and race

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.200
is it wasn't simply
black and white.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:08.160
Instead, you had numerous
gradations of color.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.200
One historian went so far

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:15.200
as to give 110
categories of color

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.560
from absolute black
to absolute white.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.030
And to each combination
he gave a name--

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:26.600
mulatto, quadroon, Mameluke.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:35.530
And what he was accounting for
was the drops of black blood.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:40.460
Whites hoped for more control
over the colony's governance,

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.260
but the colony's
mixed-race population

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.030
hoped for more
fundamental changes.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:52.530
They had been born
free, but not equal.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:56.300
They had to show
physical respect

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.330
for the white.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.400
Stand up when they are
in presence of a white,

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.660
call them mister
or whatever title

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.200
they wanted to have.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.100
It was not easy for them,
and that's exactly why

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.560
they were the first ones--
before the blacks--

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:21.730
they are the first ones
to ask for equality.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.200
The mixed-race population
of Saint-Domingue

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.100
decided their chance
had come in 1791.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.230
They sent a petition to
France's new government

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:34.800
asking for the rights
of citizenship.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.100
This is a powerful message
to have been taking place

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.960
in a society that was
explicitly organized

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.360
on inequality.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.660
It's like dynamite.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.160
[Men speaking French]

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.660
The petition asked
for civil protections,

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.460
and it enraged the
island's white population.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.030
Working-class colonists

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:03.130
began a full-scale
intimidation campaign.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.730
They threatened,
beat, and murdered

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:14.160
mixed-race residents
in the capital.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.060
But the petition met
a different reception

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.260
back in Paris.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.700
The new breed of delegates
in the National Assembly

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.260
issued a landmark decree.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.400
They extended equal rights
to the small population

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:38.130
of mixed-raced people
born of two free parents.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.100
Despite the reform's
limited extent,

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.060
the governor of Saint-Domingue
refused to obey.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.160
Colonial whites felt
profoundly betrayed.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.830
Some, such as a planter's
wife named Madame de Rouvray,

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.030
began discussing radical
thoughts of their own.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.200
[Actor as De Rouvray]
The National Assembly

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.600
is committed to destroying
our lives as masters.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.830
So much so, that
secession from France

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:08.760
The slave-owners of America,
I hope, will band together

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:24.100
to stop this
contagion of liberty.

and listen to the

which speaks in the
hearts of all of us.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.730
In August, 1791,

00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.460
as Saint-Domingue's white
and mix-raced populations

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.130
squared off for a showdown,

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:08.360
Boukman called together slaves
from neighboring plantations.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.500
They'd been kidnapped from
different parts of Africa,

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:41.360
and the voodoo religion
was their common culture.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.260
Boukman had called them to
an area called Bois Ca man.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:54.460
First on the agenda
was strategy.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:58.160
[Man] That ceremony
of Bois Ca man

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.000

planned that night to revolt.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.700
They timed their uprising

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.530
to start on multiple plantations

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.160
in two weeks' time.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.200

they killed a pig

[Men singing in native language]

On the night of
August 22, 1791,

00:18:43.830 --> 00:19:05.100
a thousand enslaved Africans
attacked their masters.

[Man] For them to be free,

that you exerted on them.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:20.930
That's why the revolution
was very brutal.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:22.960
This is that hatred,

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:28.760
in the first day,
that came out.

[people screaming]

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:44.460
The rebel numbers grew
from 1,000 to 20,000

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.260
as newly-liberated slaves

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.500
burned cane fields
and refineries

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:56.560
in order to destroy the system
that had enslaved them.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.430
the most profitable
plantations in the Americas

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:02.360
had been laid waste--

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.560
184 sugar plantations

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.200
and a thousand coffee farms.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.460
Whites and mixed-race people
fled to the capital city

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.900
for mutual protection.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:24.900
From there, they watched
fire storms on all horizons.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:29.700
You've got a fiery
cataclysm of enormous scale.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.360
I mean, the people on
ships in the harbor

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.200
supposedly could read their mail

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.100
by the light of these
fires that were, you know,

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.830
10, 15, 20 miles away, to
give you some faint idea

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:43.600
of what this would have been
like if you were there.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.560
The eruption of violence
put Toussaint Louverture

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.030
in a difficult position.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:53.700
His own fortunes were tied
to the plantation system,

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.400
and he had straddled the
white and black worlds

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.460
for some 15 years.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.630
Toussaint was no longer a slave.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:05.960
He didn't have the
mentality of a slave.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:12.530
He was the owner of two
or three plantations.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:15.300
He was not of the
same class anymore.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.260
His interests were different

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:25.100
from the interests
of the masses.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.630
But Toussaint's first reaction
to the raging violence

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.930
was based neither
on money nor race.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.530
It was personal.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:37.260
He went back to the plantation
where he had been born

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.900
to protect his former owners.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.830
[Man] It's true that
Toussaint Louverture

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:43.930
did return to the plantation

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:45.630
in the early days
of the insurrection

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.330
and kind of maintained
order there.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.660
And there's always-- there's
the question of why--

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.200
I think Toussaint was
somebody who understood

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.030
the value of humanity
in many ways, right?

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.430
And I think he probably
had gained that

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:07.660
precisely from being on the
receiving end of slavery.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.660
Back in the capital city,

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.360
as Toussaint helped
his former master

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.100
flee the violence,
Saint-Domingue's whites

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.600
repelled assault after assault.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.460
They soon regrouped

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:27.530
and launched their
own offensive.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:31.130
The bloodletting
continued day after day,

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:34.230

with stakes driven through them

was killed in battle.

White soldiers decapitated him

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:10.660
and burned his body in
view of the rebel camp.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.700
In the words of one observer,

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.760
The conflict in Saint-Domingue

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:27.460
had become an exterminating war.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.930
[neighing]

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.960
[Narrator] In the
autumn of 1791,

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.160
Toussaint Louverture
could no longer sit

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.830
on the sidelines.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.460
Despite a wife and children,

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.430
despite the chance even of
losing his own freedom,

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:47.260
Toussaint didn't hesitate long.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.460
He left everything,
he dropped everything,

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:55.460
and he went to the mountain.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.960
It was an act of
extraordinary risk.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.400
The island's 500,000 slaves

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.030
outnumbered whites by 12 to 1,

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.960
but their ultimate
prospects were poor.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.830
Few had experience
in military strategy

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:18.560
and they had no unifying
history or long-term vision.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.500
didn't really know what freedom
was supposed to look like.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.600
Nobody had really even theorized

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.430
or imagined this before.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.060
Toussaint, on the other hand,

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.460
had a unique window
on the world.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.900
He was schooled in African
and European culture alike,

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.830
and had read some of France's
most radical thinkers.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:44.260
[Man] Toussaint had certainly
read a text by L'abbe Raynal

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:48.560
which predicted that out of
the colonial slave system

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.200
with its, you know, frightening
imbalance of numbers

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.460
and horrible
suffering and all that

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.930
there would emerge a leader,
revolutionary leader.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.700
I believe Raynal referred to him

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.800
as a black Spartacus.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.400
Toussaint was a literary person.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.960
There's no way he
would have missed this.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.460
As rebel leaders
struggled to forge

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.900
a disciplined fighting force,

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:18.630
Toussaint's talents and
intellect set him apart.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.400
Then, in December, 1791,

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.460
some four months after
the rebellion began,

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:29.960
black enthusiasm
began to crumble.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.100
The new French
government in Paris

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.660
sent more than 10,000
military reinforcements

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:42.460
to help the colonists
reestablish white rule.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.800
Supplies were scarce
in the mountains

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:49.460
and winter brought famine
to the rebel lines.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:55.400
Thousands began to surrender.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:55.430
Toussaint Louverture

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:56.300
Toussaint Louverture

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.130
was not somebody who
liked violence, really.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.960
He was good at it
if he had to do it,

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.900
but he preferred
to use negotiation,

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.460
diplomacy, guile,
trickery, anything, but...

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.700
And if that didn't work,
he'd kill you, no problem.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:13.800
But he'd try
anything else first.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.860
Toussaint Louverture
was asked to write up

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.000
a settlement offer.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.400
In exchange for the freedom
of 200 slave leaders

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.730
and better working conditions
on the plantations,

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.500
the proposal offered to
send most of the rebels

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:29.930
back to the plantation.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:35.730
It was a stark recognition
of 18th century realities.

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:37.700
Sometimes it's easy
to look back at this

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:38.960
and suggest that
they were willing

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.060
to sell out their followers.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.800
While the terms,
I think it's true,

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.060
are troubling in some ways,

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.800
they were also trying
to seek some change.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.000
And I think the key here is
that it was really difficult

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:56.730
to imagine that you would
actually eliminate slavery.

00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:01.100
New French commissioners
had just arrived from Paris

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.760
to restore order.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.660
More liberal than
the planters,

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.830
they urged
Saint-Domingue's whites

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:08.300
to accept the rebels' offer

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:12.600
and they called slave leaders
to the capital of Le Cap

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.000
for negotiations.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.530
Trust was minimal.

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.400
Some slave rebels wanted to kill

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.430
their white prisoners,

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:23.660
but Toussaint Louverture
argued against it.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.630
He wanted the whites
returned to Le Cap

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:33.160
as a gesture of goodwill.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.360
So Toussaint is sent to
negotiate with the planters

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.260
with the idea that, in a sense,
a settlement can be reached.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:42.960
The settlement is not only
for the freedom of some
of the insurgent leaders,

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.300
but also for some reforms
on the plantation.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.300
Small reforms,
but reforms that,

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.060
at least in the
letters they describe,

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.560
their followers really want.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.060
Whether the small
group of leaders

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.800
actually would have
had the power to say

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.660
to all of these people
that they'd taken,

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.260
Okay, you're going
back to work now.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.300
Here's your chains.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.500
I don't know.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.200
the white people
were so short-sighted

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.460
that they didn't even give
him the opportunity to try.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.560
[Man] The whites said no.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.200
They said no because
at that time,

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.200
they were the ones
who wanted revenge.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.130
They forget about what they
have done for three centuries

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.960
and they think that they were
the victims in that thing.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.000
So they have to
avenge themselves,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.830
so they're not going to
forgive or forget anything.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.160
They refused.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.560
[no audible dialogue]

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.100
Of course he's taking
up arms against them.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.160
But at the same time, he's
made a lot of concessions

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.900
and he's struggled
against his own followers

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.860
to say, look, we're going to
treat their prisoners well,

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:42.800
we're going to trade with them,
we're willing to make a deal.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.100
And to have that refused
by the planter class

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.200
I think certainly must have
had a radicalizing effect.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.500
Toussaint's support for a
settlement abruptly ended,

00:28:54.500 --> 00:29:05.030
and with it the best deal
the whites would ever see.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:11.500
[people shouting]
[horses neighing]

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:11.530
[Narrator] Back in France,

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:12.530
[Narrator] Back in France,

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:18.530
the democratic revolution
had turned to terror.

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:20.930
France's revolutionary army

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.860
was at war with
neighboring countries.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.260
Its radical leaders
sought to purge themselves

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.130
of enemies from within.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:33.160
They executed thousands.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:39.560
And in early 1793, they
did the unthinkable.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:46.730
The revolutionary government
beheaded the king.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.060
Events in France
were moving faster

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:52.060
than anyone had ever intended.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:55.060
I mean, this was
volcanic upheaval,

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:55.100
a true class revolution

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.000
a true class revolution

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.460
that turned everything
completely upside-down.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.130
And each ripple that came out

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:08.730
would strike the shores
of Saint-Domingue.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.060
One of the biggest
ripples from France

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.400
that washed into
Saint-Domingue's shores

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:20.660
was a commissioner named
Leger-Felicite Sonthonax.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.200
He was a French revolutionary

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:28.930
with radical ideas about
life in the colony.

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.160
Sonthonax arrives
in Saint-Domingue

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.760
having already had bad
words said about him.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.930
There are people who have
actually written from France

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:39.300
to the colonists on
Saint-Domingue saying,
Watch out for this guy.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.130
He's an abolitionist, he
wants to abolish slavery.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:44.300
[chatter] [chickens clucking]

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.130
Saint-Domingue's
mix-raced population

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:52.700
had so far retained its fragile
alignment with the whites.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.430
To ensure that continued,

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:57.330
Sonthonax created a
representational council

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:01.830
on the island and invited
mixed-race citizens to serve.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:09.530
He even brought mixed-raced mn
into the colonial government.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:10.430
And a lot of white planters

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:13.230
are really, really
upset about that,

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:14.630
and see him as--

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:19.160
that as a really
destructive force.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.360
The white planters
had cause for worry.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.200
Less than two years after
joining the rebellion,

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:31.860
Toussaint Louverture had risen
to the top of the rebel army.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.430
[Actor as Louverture] I
am Toussaint Louverture.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:37.760
My name is perhaps known to you.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.100
In 1793, he wrote
an open letter

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.030
to the island's disenfranchised.

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:46.130
I have undertaken vengeance.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:51.530
I want liberty and equality
to reign in Saint-Domingue.

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:55.100
I'll work to bring
them into existence.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.930
Unite yourselves
to us, brothers,

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:01.300
and fight with us
for the same cause.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.530
With his letter, he
announces two things.

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:05.200
He announces first of
all, his commitment

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.700
to the process-- to the
project of emancipation.

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:11.130
And he announces his
presence as a leader.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:15.560
He has gained great
respect from his followers.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.360
he's essentially saying,
You want freedom,

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.960
and I'm the one who's gonna
bring you that freedom.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:24.860
So I'm the person to
follow in this regard.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.760
But Toussaint, at this time,

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.130
was addressing the
wider world, too.

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:33.960
He was particularly
focused on Spain.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.860
The Spanish wanted
to wrestle the colony

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:40.930
away from France
for two reasons.

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:45.730
First, the colony was
very, very prosperous,

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.500
in spite of the war.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.900
And second, that prosperity

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.100
was used by the
French Revolution

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:56.500
to combat them in Europe.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.360
Spain controlled
Saint-Domingue's

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.060
neighboring colony.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:03.460
So in June of 1793,

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.130
Toussaint struck a deal.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:08.700
Spanish garrisons,
just over the border,

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.630
provided guns and ammunition

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:11.660
to the slave army

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.430
and tipped the
balance their way.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.930
Toussaint's forces
captured three cities

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:23.860
within eight months.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.460
Saint-Domingue's white planters

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.460
were desperate.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:31.200
Many hated the new
order in France.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.360
In a treasonous move,

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.400
they invited the
British to help put down

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.360
the slave rebellion.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:42.060
Now, the empires of
France, Spain and England,

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:45.000
along with a vast
army of former slaves,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:54.660
were fighting for control
of the small island colony.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.130
Then, in early 1794,

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:02.030
events in Paris caused
another explosion

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:05.100
A multi-racial delegation
from Saint-Domingue

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.660
had appeared in France's
National Assembly.

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:11.830
They had been sent by
Commissioner Sonthonax

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:13.430
with a dramatic message.

00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:16.230
He had pledged freedom to
Saint-Domingue's slaves

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:20.060
for fighting the armies
of Britain and Spain.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.730
The emissaries made a
compelling argument.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:27.560
These are the principles
and the ideals of France

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.060
and we fully represent them.

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.760
And we wish to continue
to represent them

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.660
And so we've come to
present our arguments

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:37.130
about why we are, in
fact, truly committed

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:38.960
to those ideals
and principles,

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.000
and how we epitomize
these principles

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.460
of the French Revolution.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.600
I think it was very powerful

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.130
for the representatives
of France

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:50.060
to hear essentially that what
had happened in the Caribbean

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:53.130
is that the white slave
owners had deserted France.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:55.830
They had gone over
to the British.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:59.660
And the true people-- the true
Republicans inSaint-Domingue--

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:04.200
were these enslaved people who
just wanted their freedom.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.600
The French National Assembly

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.430
endorsed the emancipation

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:11.000
of Saint-Dominguan slaves.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.630
But that was not all.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:14.230
The delegates freed slaves

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:17.730
throughout the
entire Empire, too.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:21.330
And there's rejoicing
and celebration.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:24.230
There's an older woman,
a free woman of color,

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.030
who's traditionally
gone to the debates

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:28.200
who, sort of, sheds tears

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.030
and is brought
down and celebrated

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:31.560
as part of this moment.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.060
And there are speeches in Paris.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.300
Celebrations of this
event throughout France.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.560
It's really seen as
a kind of triumph

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.230
for the ideals of the
French Revolution.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.730
That this worst
form of hierarchy--

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:44.300
enslavement and oppression--

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:53.630
has been abolished
in the Caribbean.

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.130
It was utterly unprecedented.

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:59.700
In a stroke, nearly a
million black slaves

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:20.530
had become French citizens.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:24.000
Word that the French
Revolutionary government

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.560
had freed its slaves

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.330
reached Saint-Domingue quickly.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.560
It was one of history's
great watersheds,

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.900
and due largely to
the extraordinary

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:37.060
military accomplishments
of Toussaint's army.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.800
But the credit did not
rest with Toussaint alone.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.000
He had several able commanders

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.260
working under him.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.730
Men like Jean-Jacques
Dessalines,

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:49.400
who shared his soldier's
life experiences

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:54.130
more closely than Toussaint.

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:58.560
Dessalines had been mistreated
in slavery considerably.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.360
He had tremendous
whip scars on his back

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.730
that he liked to
display on occasion.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:07.930
He had deep reserves
of anger and violence.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:12.430
But also a very intelligent man.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.260
For Dessalines and Toussaint,

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:17.430
emancipation changed everything.

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:19.830
They quickly trimmed their sails

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.660
to the new order.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:27.560
Toussaint realized
that Spain had a king,

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:33.100
and France was talking about
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:36.360
All men equal.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.600
So he realized that

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:43.930
although he first started
by fighting the French,

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:45.700
the French right now

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:50.630
could be the best help
they could receive.

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:57.030
So he rejoined the French.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:59.200
After three years
in opposition,

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.660
Toussaint Louverture
was once again

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.160
a loyal French citizen.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:12.000
So were his followers.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.730
It tipped the balance.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:18.360
Toussaint, Dessalines, and
their army of ex-slaves,

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.000
pushed the Spanish
out of Saint-Domingue.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.600
The British soon followed.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.430
Word of Toussaint's
astonishing string of victoris

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:31.060
against white armies

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:36.130
was spreading across
the European world.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.760
They didn't like it.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.500
They didn't like it at all

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:43.700
that there was a black
general beating white armies.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.530
They didn't like it.

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:49.630
Slaveholders
everywhere were stunned

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:51.430
and worried.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:55.430
In the United
States, for instance,

00:38:55.430 --> 00:39:00.360
they didn't want even
white Frenchmen to come

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.700
because they would
tell the story.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.760
Why are you running away
fromSaint-Domingue?

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.300
They would answer that.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.960
And no matter what
they answered,

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.730
it would be known that
there was a black revolt.

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:16.160
[Actor as Louverture]
We confronted dangers in
order to gain our liberty

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:20.560
and we will be able to confront
death in order to keep it.

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.300
Slaves had once
accepted their chain

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:28.100
because they had not experienced
a state happier than slavery.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.800
But those days are over.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.960
The people of Saint-Domingue
would rather be buried

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.500
in the ruin of their country

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:39.800
than suffer the
return of slavery.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.030
Toussaint's ringing language

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:44.800
showed his profound attachment
to democratic ideals.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:49.200
But there was another
side to Toussaint, too.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:54.560
Anybody who looked like
they threatened Toussaint,

00:39:54.560 --> 00:40:00.760
either ended up
dead or deported.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.530
Toussaint had already
been appointed

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:06.930
brigadier general and then
governor of Saint-Domingue.

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:11.700
No black man had ever risen
so far in the colonies.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:17.830
But Toussaint had a rival--

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:20.360
The beloved French
civil commissioner,

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:24.230
Felicite Sonthonax.

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:27.100
Sonthonax was extremely popular

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:32.900
because he was the one to say,
Okay, slavery is abolished.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.200
He was very popular.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.460
And the blacks used
call him Papa Sonthonax.

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.960
That didn't go well
with Toussaint.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.360
Toussaint is very
friendly with Sonthonax

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.930
as long as Sonthonax
can serve his purposes.

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:48.930
And nothing personal about it.

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:50.030
When Sonthonax
becomes useless,

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:52.100
we will send him
back over there.

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:56.230
That's as simple as that.

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:57.660
And in 1797,

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:01.400
Toussaint, in fact, no
longer needed Sonthonax.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.660
In a series of
political maneuvers,

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:06.660
he isolated the
civil commissioner.

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.630
Then in August,

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:10.200
he forced Sonthonax
off the island.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:21.200
Toussaint Louverture
had triumphed again.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.700
[Narrator] In 1798,

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:24.530
as Toussaint
Louverture was evicting

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:27.160
the last of the British
from his island,

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:30.800
another French general
battled British interest

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.560
halfway around the
world in Egypt.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:40.760
His name was Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.660
[Man] Well, Toussaint
and Napoleon in many
ways are similar.

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:46.660
Both were a little bit from
the margins of French society.

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:49.900
They succeeded through
military brilliance

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.860
and they were both
incredible military leaders.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.360
And they became
political leaders

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:57.560
as a result of their
military experience.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.230
But Napoleon's victories

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:01.760
would put Toussaint's at risk.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.800
Just months after
conquering Egypt,

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.500
Napoleon marched into Paris.

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:10.330
A coup d'etat toppled the
revolutionary government

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:13.230
and Napoleon took
the reins of power.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:17.000
The revolution is
over, he declared.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.630
I am the revolution.

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:25.030
As Napoleon is rising
to power in France,

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:27.700
Toussaint is watching closely

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.300
He knows several things.
He knows first of all,

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:33.100
that there are very powerful
pro-slavery voices in France

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.460
who are agitating against
him, attacking him,

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:39.830
and proposing that slavery
actually be recreated

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:42.660
in some form in Saint-Domingue.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.730
Toussaint believed
Saint-Domingue's survival

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:48.030
and the survival
of freedom itself

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:51.630
depended on his ability
to mobilize people

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:54.200
to rebuild the
devastated economy.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.360
And in Toussaint's mind,

00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:03.760
that meant one thing.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:14.660
His black followers should
return to the cane fields.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:16.800
There were some compelling
reasons for this.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.000
I mean, mainly, in
Toussaint's situation,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.300
he was really in a
bind at that point.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.830
Uh, in the sense that

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:26.900
his hope for peace was restoring

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.160
productivity on the plantations.

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.460
Recreating the sugar
trade, in particularly.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:36.500
But nobody wanted to go
back to that kind of work.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.660
So he pretty well
had to force them.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.360
And then the people
began to think,

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:46.130
Hmm. This is a lot like slavery.

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:48.730
Maybe a little too
strong with the blacks

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:50.230
on several occasions.

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:52.100
But he had to do it.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.030
He had to do it.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:55.760
To be a leader,
you've got to know

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.660
where to lay back,

00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:59.230
and you have to
know when to say,

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:01.660
Okay, guys. Go
ahead. Let's do it.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:03.000
If you don't do it, well,

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.800
whatever the consequences,
you'll pay for it.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.830
Most newly freed slaves

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:13.300
didn't see it that way.

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.200
They wanted to work
for themselves,

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.600
growing crops for food
rather than export.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:26.630
Toussaint's luster
began to tarnish.

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:29.000
Napoleon, on the other hand,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.430
was riding high.

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:35.200
and proclaimed a new
constitution for France.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.060
Far from enshrining
black emancipation,

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:39.500
it opened the door for France

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:46.660
to reinstitute slavery
in its colonies.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:47.700
When Louverture heard that,

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.200
he really understood that
something was changing.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.730
And more ominously,
he understood that

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:54.900
he didn't have any way
to influence Napoleon.

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:58.830
And what he did in typical
Toussaint fashion,

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:01.560
Okay. Saint-Domingue is
gonna have its own laws?

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.460
Well, here they are.
I'm in charge here.

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:08.460
I might as well write
the constitution.

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.560
Toussaint's constitution decreed

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:14.330
slavery would never exist
in Saint-Domingue again.

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.300
And it was the first in history

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.730
to prohibit discrimination
based on skin color--

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:24.330
a milestone that U.S.
law would not guarantee

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:28.860
for another 150 years.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:32.560
The constitution had
troubling elements, too.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.600
It made Toussaint
governor for life,

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:41.430
with sole authority to
designate his successor.

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:43.700
Toussaint's a
great hero to me,

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.030
but this was not a good idea.

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:48.000
I mean, he basically,
with that gesture,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
installed permanent
military dictatorship,

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.360
which has remained a problem
in Haiti for two centuries.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:58.700
He could have done
what he needed to do
without that, I think.

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.560
I'm not quite sure
why he did it.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:08.360
But that was enough to send
Napoleon over the edge.

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:13.100
Napoleon Bonaparte had
had enough of revolution.

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:14.430
And according to Napoleon,

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:18.100
the U.S. President,
Thomas Jefferson,

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.030
shared his view.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:22.600
[Actor as Bonaparte] The
prospect of a black republic,

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.830
is equally disturbing
to the Spanish,

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:27.360
the English, and
the Americans.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.830
Jefferson has promised
that at the instant

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:31.030
the French army has arrived,

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:34.300
all measures will be
taken to starve Toussaint.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:36.800
Rid us of these guilty negroes

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:41.900
and we will have nothing
more to wish for.

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:43.160
Toussaint tried urgently

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:47.900
to show Napoleon
that military logic,

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:51.260
proved the merit
of black ambitions.

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:53.830
Toussaint was writing Napoleon.

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:58.100
He wanted so much
to be recognized

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:04.830
as saving this land for France.

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:06.960
His efforts failed.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.030
In 1802,

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:09.530
Toussaint was stunned to see

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:13.660
the largest French expeditionary
force ever assembled

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.860
entering
Saint-Domingue's harbor.

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.660
Its mission was simple.

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:23.900
Napoleon wanted to
turn back the clock.

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.360
[Bonaparte] My
decision to destroy

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.730
the authority of the
blacks in Saint-Domingue

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:30.200
is not so much based
on consideration

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.830
of commerce and money,

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:33.260
as on the need to block forever

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:39.200
the march of the
blacks in the world.

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.630
Toussaint Louverture fought
the invading French ary

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:44.430
for three grueling months.

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:47.100
But the island's
black population,

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:50.060
now disenchanted
with his leadership,

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:58.230
offered lackluster support.

00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:00.130
On May 6th, 1802,

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:03.130
Toussaint Louverture
surrendered.

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:06.960
At first, he was allowed
to retire from the army

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.960
with full honors.

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:15.160
he was called to a meeting
with the French commander.

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.160
[Actor as Louverture]
If I wanted to count

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.360
all the services
that I have rendered

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.960
to the French government,

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.760
I will need several volumes,

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:26.100
and still I wouldn't
finish it all.

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:31.660
Toussaint was arrested on
charges of conspiracy.

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:34.530
He wrote some stuff that's
very eloquent of saying,

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:38.100
I rather suspect that
it's because of my color

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.730
that you're treating me
like a common criminal,

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:43.360
although I prefer
not to believe this.

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.500
[Louverture] And
to compensate me

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:49.630
for all the services, they
arrested me arbitrarily

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:53.230
They choked me and dragged
me like a criminal,

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:56.500
without any decorum or
concern for my rank.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:59.660
Is that the recompense
due my work?

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:03.000
Normally, a mutinous
French officer

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.130
would have been brought
before a military tribunal,

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:10.100
so he comports himself
as if he's gonna
have a military trial.

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:15.030
Toussaint's sons had
been educated in France.

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:16.730
They had even met Napoleon.

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:20.800
Hoping again that Napoleon
would understand his thinking,

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:27.630
Toussaint peacefully
boarded a ship for France.

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:31.160
Saint-Domingue
remained mostly calm

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.600
Jean-Jacques Dessalines and
the other black officers

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:38.500
continued cooperating
with French general,

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.760
Victor Leclerc.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:44.900
But then, news arrived
from the nearby colony

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:45.800
of Guadeloupe.

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:49.500
Napoleon had reinstated slavery.

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.130
Leclerc reported that he
hadDessalines in his pocket,

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:54.100
and controlled him and
had mastered his spirit.

00:49:54.100 --> 00:50:00.030
Well, ha, ha. He was
extremely wrong about that.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:03.830
Saint-Domingue erupted
in anger and fear.

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:08.330
Dessalines quickly
broke from France.

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:10.100
One more time,

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.200
the former slaves
of Saint-Domingue

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:18.000
took to the field
against European armies.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.160
Dessalines is a no-holds
barred, no-compromising leader

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:25.330
and figure who is going
to eradicate anything

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:27.430
that stands in the
way of what the people

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:30.600
have been mobilizing towards.

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.600
[Man] It's generally
reported thatDessalines

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.760
killed all the white people--

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.300
a massacre of all white people.

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:37.230
A race war.

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:38.700
No, not really.

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.960
There was one
report by a survivor

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.900
who managed to get
out, to escape,

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.530
by masquerading
as an American,

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:47.500
'cause Dessalines was
not killing Americans

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.560
or English, just French.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:56.400
Aah!

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.660
One fleeing white,
Pierre Chazaud,

00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.200
paused on a mountaintop

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.760
to observe the devastation.

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.230
[Actor as Chazaud]
No less than ten

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:11.630
square leagues of country,
burning like volcanoes.

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:14.900
The rapidity of the
conflagration was such

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:17.360
as to make the beholder
believe that large,

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.600
and thick trains of gunpowder

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:30.030
had previously been laid down.

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:33.360
The war becomes this
extreme scorched earth

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:34.260
kind of campaign in which

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.630
Dessalines and
others burn the towns

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:38.200
in order to, basically,
leave the French

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:43.330
with little-- with no
choice but to depart.

00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:48.160
Dessalines' scorched
earth tactics worked.

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.160
In 1803,

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:52.600
the French army was
finally driven out.

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:57.000
50,000 French
soldiers had died.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.100
And Saint-Domingue, Haiti,

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:07.160
became the world's
first black republic.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.230
This is a powerful story.

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:11.730
It wasn't just an
anti-colonial revolution.

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:14.830
But it was, also, an
anti-slavery revolution,

00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:19.130
in that it said, Your
economy and your privilege

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:21.700
which is based
on forced labor,

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:23.130
cannot stand-- It
will not stand.

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:26.360
It's a message that
translates through time.

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:32.430
Independence is the
strongest feeling

00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:35.060
of human being.

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.660
I think we all, in some ways,

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.630
have inherited something
from this revolution.

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:41.600
Because it's really
the first place

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.500
that people insisted
absolutely that

00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:47.830
human rights were
for all people.

00:52:47.830 --> 00:52:50.530
It's something that
everybody should know about.

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:53.360
To know exactly
what our species--

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:56.630
not black people,
but our species--

00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:59.400
can realize.

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:04.000
But Toussaint Louverture
never lived to see victory.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.800
By the time Haiti
attained the goal

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:09.300
he fought so hard to achieve,

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.130
the imprisoned revolutionary

00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:13.630
had died in a freezing cell

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:18.530
in the mountains of France.

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:19.860
In overthrowing me,

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:22.960
Louverture wrote as
he left for France,

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.500
you have only cut down the trunk

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:29.060
of the liberty tree of the
blacks in Saint-Domingue.

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:31.330
It will spring back
from the roots,

00:53:31.330 --> 00:00:01.700
for they are numerous and deep.
