WEBVTT

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
IT WAS A SENSATIONAL STORY.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
TONIGHT, WE HAVE NEW

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
DOCUMENTS AND NEW INFORMATION ON

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.000
THE PRESIDENT'S MILITARY

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
SERVICE.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
AND A COLOSSAL MISTAKE.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
CBS NEWS REGRETS IT.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
ALSO, I WANT TO SAY PERSONALLY

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
AND DIRECTLY, I'M SORRY.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
A CONVERSATION WITH THE TWO MEN

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
WHO LED THE INVESTIGATION.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
THERE WAS A FAILURE IN THE

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.000
VETING PROCESS.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
THE BIG CULL TRITT WAS HASTE.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
TONIGHT, FALLOUT, THE CBS

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
REPORT.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
IN THIS BUSINESS, THE SCOOP

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
IS OFTEN THE TROPHY PRIZED ABOVE

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
ALL ELSE.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
VIEWERS AND READERS MAY NOT CARE

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
WHO BREAKS A NEWS STORY.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
BUT WE JOURNALISTS DO.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
AND THAT DRIVE TO BE FIRST

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
SOMETIMES CONFLICTS WITH OTHER

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
PROFESSIONAL IDEALS, NAMELY

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
GETTING THE STORY RIGHT AND

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
REPORTING IT FAIRLY.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
TODAY, VETERAN JOURNALISTS AT

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
THE CBS NEWS PROGRAM "60 MINUTES

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
MINUTES" INCLUDING DAN RATHER,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
STAND ACCUSED OF SACRIFICING

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
ACCURACY AND FAIRNESS FOR THE

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
SAKE OF A SKOUP.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
AN INDEPENDENT PANEL, LOOKING

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
INTO THE REPORT, QUESTIONING

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
PRESIDENT BUSH'S SERVICE IN THE

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000

INCLUDING BLOGGERS, FIRST RAISED

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DOCUMENTS IN

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
THAT POLITICALLY-EXPLOSIVE

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.000
STORY.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
THE PRODUCER AND NEWS EXECUTIVES

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
ARE PAYING THE PRICE.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
THEY'VE BEEN FORCED OUT.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
IN NOVEMBER, DAN RATHER

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION TO STEP

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
DOWN AS THE ANCHOR OF THE CBS

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000

LATER, WE'LL TALK TO THE AUTHORS

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
OF TODAY'S REPORT.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
BUT FIRST, JIM WOOTEN ON THE

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
FINDINGS THAT GAVE CBS NEWS AND

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
THE REST OF US A BLACK EYE.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
WHEN THE TSUNAMI HIT --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Reporter: IN THE CONTINUOUS

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
FLOOD OF RECENT TSUNAMI

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000

TELEVISION NEWS.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
DIANE, THIS MORNING, IS IN

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
THE AREA HIT FIRST AND HIT

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.000
HARDEST.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Reporter: WITH BIG NAMES AND

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
FAMILIAR FACES, RAISED AGAINST

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
THE DEVASTATION.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
WITH DAN RATHER REPORTING

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
FROM SRI LANKA.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Reporter: IT'S DIFFICULT TO

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
REMEMBER THE STORM RAISED BY

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
THIS '60 MINUTES" REPORT,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
BROADCAST FOUR MONTHS AGO.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
DID THEN-LIEUTENANT BUSH

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
FULFILL ALL OF HIS MILITARY

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
COMMITMENTS?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Reporter: OR WHY THAT STORY

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
MAY HAVE HASTENED HIS

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
RETIREMENT.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I WANT TO SAY PERSONALLY AND

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
DIRECTLY, I'M SORRY.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Reporter: AND HOW IT HAS NOW

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
ENDED THE CBS CAREERS OF SEVERAL

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
OF HIS COLLEAGUES.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
BUT THE 224-PAGES OF THIS REPORT

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
EXPLAINED WHY AND HOW THAT ONE

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
SEGMENT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
NATIONAL GUARD SERVICE AIRED

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
DURING HIS FRACTIOUS CAMPAIGN

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
FOR RE-ELECTION --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
GEORGE BUSH HAS YET TO

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
EXPLAIN TO AMERICA WHETHER OR

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
NOT -- AND TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
WHETHER HE SHOWED UP FOR DUTY.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Reporter: HAS NOW COME BACK

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
TO HAUNT CBS, ONE OF AMERICA'S

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
MOST PRESTIGIOUS NEWS

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
ORGANIZATIONS.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
SEPTEMBER 8th LAST YEAR.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
'"60 MINUTES" HAS OBTAINED --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Reporter: RATHER OBTAINS

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
DOCUMENTS PROBUSH'S NATIONAL

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.000
GUARD COMMANDER.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
LATER, THEY SAY THEY'RE SOURCE

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
WAS A FORMER GUARD OFFICER,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
KNOWN FOR HIS ANTAGONISM TOWARD

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
THE PRESIDENT.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
THE DOCUMENTS QUESTIONED THE

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
MANNER IN WHICH MR. BUSH

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
FULFILLED HIS DUTIES DURING THE

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
VIETNAM WAR.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
BUT THE AUTHENTICITY IS

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
IMMEDIATELY CHALLENGED AND

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
CHARGES OF FORGERY ARE RAISED.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I FOUND FIVE SIGNIFICANT

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
DIFFERENCES --

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Reporter: STILL, RIG LOUSELY,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
STEADFASTLY, CBS DEFENDS THE

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.000
STORY.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
UNTIL, AT LAST, AFTER NEARLY TWO

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
WEEKS, THIS MEA CULPA --

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
THE FAILURE TO PROPERLY

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
SCRUTINIZE THE DOCUMENTS AND

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
THEIR SOURCE, LED TO OUR AIRING

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
THE DOCUMENTS WHEN WE SHOULD NOT

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
HAVE DONE SO.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.000
CBS NEWS DEEPLY REGRETS IT.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Reporter: AND EVENTUALLY TWO

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
MONTHS LATER, THERE WAS THIS

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
FROM RATHER, AS WELL.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
A FEW WARDS ABOUT THE CBS

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
NEWS.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I'VE DECIDED IT'S TIME TO MOVE

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
ON.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I'LL WILL LEAVING THE EVENING

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
NEWS NEXT MARCH.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Reporter: THE NETWORK

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
COMMISSIONED AN INDEPENDENT

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
ENTIRELY, HEADED BY RICHARD

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
TORNBURG AND FORMER ASSOCIATED

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
PRESS PRESIDENT, LEWIS BOCCARDI.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
AND THEIR REPORT FOUND A LITANY

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
OF MISSTEPS IN THE BROADCAST.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
WE CONSULTED A HANDWRITING

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
ANALYST AND DOCUMENT EXPERT WHO

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
BELIEVES THE MATERIAL IS

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
AUTHENTIC.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Reporter: AMONG THEM, THE

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
NETWORKS FAILURE TO OBTAIN CLEAR

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
AUTHENTICATION OF THE DOCUMENTS.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
AND ITS FALSE STATEMENT THAT

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
EXPERTS HAD VOUCHED FOR THEIR

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
AUTHENTICITY.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
MOREOVER, THE REPORT SAYS --

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
AND AFTERWARDS, CBS MOUNTED A

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
STRIDENT DEFENSE, WITHOUT

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
ADEQUATELY PROBING WHETHER THE

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
QUESTIONS RAISED HAD MERIT.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
THOSE WHO CRITICIZED ASPECTS

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
OF OUR STORY, NEVER CRITICIZED

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
THE HEART OF IT.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Reporter: IN SUMMARY, THE

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
REPORT SAYS CBS NEWS WAS DRIVEN

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
BY A MYOPIC ZEAL, THAT 3R0

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
DEUCED A STORY THAT WAS NEITHER

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
FAIR MORE ACCURATE.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
AND DID NOT FULFILL THE NETWORK

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
OS CORE PRINCIPALS OF JOURNALISM

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
UNIMPEACHABLE INTEGRITY.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
TODAY, THE PRESIDENT OF THE

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
NETWORK DID NOT TAKE ISSUE WITH

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
THAT VERDICT.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
ISN'T ONE OF CBS NEWS' GREATEST

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
MOMENTS.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
CLEARLY, WE HAVE REHABILITATION

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.000
TO DO.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
HOPEFULLY, TODAY IS THE FIRST

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.000
STEP TO DOING THAT.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Reporter: THE CASUALTIES

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000

SEGMENT.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
MARY MAPES, A CBS VETERAN THAT

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
PRODUCED THE STORY WITH RATHER

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
WAS ALSO FIRED.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
REPORT SAYS SHE ARRANGED THE

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
CONTACT BETWEEN THE LIEUTENANT

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
COLONEL AND THE KERRY CAMPAIGN,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
WHICH CREATED THE APPEARANCE OF

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
A POLITICAL BIAS.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
THE PRESIDENT OF CBS NEWS,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
ANDREW HAYWARD, WILL REMAIN IN

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
HIS JOB.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
TIME AND AGAIN, ANDREW SAID,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
DO NOT PUT THIS ON THE AIR UNTIL

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
IT'S READY.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
DON'T BE STEAM-ROLLED.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
I WANT EVERY SYLLABLE CHECKED

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
BEFORE THE REPORT GOES ON THE

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
AIR.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I THINK WHAT HE WAS GUILTY OF

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
WAS THE FAILURE OF HIS PEOPLE.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Reporter: AS FOR RATHER, WHO

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
RETURNED TO NEW YORK FROM ASIA,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
ONLY LAST NIGHT, HE WILL

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
CONTINUE ON '60 MINUTES."

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
BUT WILL PRESIDE OVER EXACTLY 42

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
MORE EVENING BROADCASTS BEFORE

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
HIS FINAL APPEARANCE IN THE

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
ANCHOR CHAIR.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
JIM WOOTEN, FOR "NIGHTLINE," IN

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
WASHINGTON.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
SO, DOES TODAY'S REPORT ON

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
CBS NEWS ANSWER ALL THE

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.000
QUESTIONS?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
WE'LL TALK TO THE AWE THOFRS

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
THOSE FINDINGS WHEN WE COME

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
BACK.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I'M JOINED BY THE TWO

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
GENTLEMEN BEHIND TODAY'S REPORT.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
RICHARD THORNBURGH, THE FORMER

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
AND LEWIS BOCCARDI, THE FORMER

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
CHIEF OFFICER OF THE ASSOCIATED

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
PRESS.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
YOUR REPORT BLAMES A 3450I OFIC

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
ZEAL TO BE FIRST.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
AT THE SAME TIME, IT CONCLUDES

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
THAT "60 MINUTES" WAS NOT DRIVEN

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
BY ANY POLITICAL AGENDA.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
THE SUFFICIENCIES IN THE

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
PRODUCTION OF SEPTEMBER 8 WERE

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
LARGELY A FAILURE TO OBSERVE A

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
STANDARDS THAT CBS HAD SET WITH

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
REGARD TO ACCURACY AND FAIRNESS.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
THE BIG CULPRIT WAS HASTE.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
A RUSH TO AIR THE PROGRAM ON

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
SEPTEMBER 8, WHEN MORE CAUTION

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
SHOULD HAVE BEEN EXERCISED IN

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
VETING THE SOURCES AND IN

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
VERIFYING THE DOCUMENTS

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
INVOLVED.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
AT THE SAME TIME -- AT THE

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
SAME TIME, MR. THORNBURGH, THE

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
SOURCE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS, BILL

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
BURKETT, CLEARLY DID HAVE A

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
POLITICAL AX TO GRIND.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
THAT WAS KNOWN TO THE PRODUCERS

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
OF THE PROGRAM.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
IT WAS KNOWN TO SOME OF THOSE

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
WHO WERE INVOLVED IN VETING THE

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.000
PROCESS.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I'M SURE A LOT OF NEWS REPORTERS

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
GET INFORMATION FROM PERSONS

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
WITH THEIR OWN AGENDA.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
THE KEY IS HOW CAREFULLY DO THEY

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
VET IT?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
IN THIS CASE, WE LOOK VERY

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
CLOSELY FOR ANY SIGN OF A TRUE

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
PARTISAN BIAS ON THE PART OF CBS

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
AND ITS PERSONNEL.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
AND WE DIDN'T FIND IT.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
THEY WEREN'T THE ONLY NEWS

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
ORGANIZATION CHASING THIS STORY.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
WHAT WE DID CRITICIZE THEM FOR

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
WAS THE INSENSITIVETY TO THE

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
APPEARANCES OF USING A NUMBER OF

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
PEOPLE AS SOURCES WHO HAD THEIR

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
OWN POLITICAL AGENDAS.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
AND IN PARTICULAR, FOR PUTTING

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
THEIR SOURCE AND HIS ANTI-BUSH

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
BIAS IN TOUCH WITH RESPECTIVES

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
OF THE CAMPAIGN OF SENATOR JOHN

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
KERRY.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
THAT, WE THOUGHT WAS HIGHLY

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
IMPROPER AND INAPPROPRIATE.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
AND THAT GOES BEYOND JUST

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
GETTING INFORMATION FROM THE

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:31.000
SOURCE.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
THAT ACTUALLY INVOLVED, PERHAPS,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
THE ADVANCING OF A POLITICAL

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
CAUSE, DOES IT NOT?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.000
IT DOES.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
IT GOES BEYOND ANYTHING I WOULD

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
CONSIDER JOURNALISTICALLY

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.000
ACCEPTABLE.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
DID NO ONE --

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I WANT TO SAY THAT CLEARLY.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
DID NO ONE AT THE SENIOR

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
LEVELS OF CBS NEWS -- AND LET'S

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
NOT FORGET HERE, WE ARE IN THE

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
THICK OF A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
WHEN THIS IS GOING ON.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
SO, DID NO ONE AT THE SENIOR

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
LEVELS OF CBS NEWS SAY WAIT A

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
MINUTE -- WHO IS THIS GUY?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.000
MR. BURKETT?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
AND WHAT ARE HIS POLITICAL

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
MOTIVATIONS AT THIS TIME IN

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
HISTORY?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
WELL, THAT'S ONE OF THE MANY

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
POINTS THAT WE HAVE SO MANY

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.000
CONFLICTING VIEWS OF.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
VETING, THAT IS CLEARING THE

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
PROGRAM, SAY THAT THEY DIDN'T

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
GET THE BACKGROUND THEY WANTED.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
THEY DIDN'T KNOW NEARLY ENOUGH

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
ABOUT WHERE THESE THINGS HAD

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
COME FROM.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
THE PRODUCER, MISS MAPES, SAID

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
SHE ANSWERED ALL THE QUESTIONS

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
SHE WAS ASKED.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
AND LAID OUT THE BACKGROUND OF

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
THE PERSON FROM WHOM SHE GOT THE

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
DOCUMENTS.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
NOW THAT LEAVES YOU NEEDING TO

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
LOOK, AS WE DID, EVEN MORE

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
WIDELY, WHICH IS TO SAY, TO LOOK

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
AT THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY OF THE

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
DOCUMENTS, TO LOOK AT WHAT STEPS

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
HAD BEEN MADE TO AUTHENTICATE

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.000
THE DOCUMENTS.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GET

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
INFORMATION, DOCUMENTS, FOOTAGE,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
PICTURES, HANDOUTS, FROM

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
SOMEBODY WITH THE WORST MOTIVES

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
YOU CAN IMAGINE.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
IT DOESN'T MEAN BY DEFINITION

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
IT'S UNTRUE.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THESE

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
OTHER THINGS.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
MR. THORNBURGH, THE PRODUCER

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
OF THAT SEGMENT, MARY MAPES HAS

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
ISSUED A STATEMENT TONIGHT, IN

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
WHICH SHE BASICALLY SAYS SHE IS

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
BEING MADE A SCAPEGOAT.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
ONE PART OF HER STATEMENT

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
SAYS --

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
DID YOU FIND THAT TO BE THE CASE

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.000
OR NOT?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
THAT'S BEEN MS. MAPES'

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:42.000
POSITION ALL ALONG.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
WE UNDERTOOK A THOROUGH AND

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
DETAILED EXAMINATION OF THE

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
DOCUMENTS, COMPARING THEM TO

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
WITH REGARD TO PRESIDENT BUSH'S

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
TENURE IN THE GUARD.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
AND FOUND NUMEROUS DISCREPANCIES

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
THAT WE SET FORTH AT SOME LENGTH

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
IN THE REPORT.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
THE MESHING NOTION SIMPLY

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.000
DOESN'T HOLD UP.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
THAT THERE ARE SO MANY

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
DISCREPANCIES WITH REGARD TO

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
JARGON, WITH REGARD TO FORMAT,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
NOT TO MENTION THE LINGERING

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
THE TYPE FACE, THE FONT, AND

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
OTHER ATTRIBUTES OF THE

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
DOCUMENTS THEMSELVES WAS

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
AVAILABLE DURING THE 1970s, WHEN

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
THESE DOCUMENTS ARE ALLEGEDLY

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
HAVE BEEN PREPARED.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
WE CAN'T MAKE A FINAL

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
DETERMINATION ON A LOT OF THE

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.000
QUESTIONS.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
BUT WE SURE ENOUGH KNOW, THAT

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
NOT ENOUGH QUESTIONS WERE ASKED

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
ABOUT THEM PRIOR TO THEM AIRING

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
ON SEPTEMBER 8th.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
WHAT ABOUT THE LARGER POINT

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
THAT MARY MAPES MAKES -- AT THE

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
END OF THE DAY, THE PANEL COULD

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
NOT DETERMINE THAT THE DOCUMENTS

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
WERE FALSE?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
THE REASONING THAT WE PUT IN THE

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
REPORT AND UNDERSTAND WHERE

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
WE'RE COMING FROM ON THAT POINT.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
WE ABSOLUTELY DID NOT, IN AN

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
INVESTIGATION OF A SHOW THAT

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
MADE CHARGES THAT IT COULDN'T

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
SUBSTANTIATE, WE DID NOT WANT TO

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
COMMIT THE SAME MISTAKE, WHICH

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
IS TO MAKE FINDINGS WE COULDN'T

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
PROVE.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
DON'T KNOW IF THE CBS DOCUMENT,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
THE CBS REPORT IS TRUE OR NOT?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
WE'VE GONE THIS FAR.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
IT'S IN THE REPORT -- WE SAID WE

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
CAN'T SAY THAT THE FORGERIES,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
WHAT WE FIND MANY REASONS TO

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
HAVE GRAVE DOUBTS ABOUT THE

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
AUTHENTICITY OF THE DOCUMENTS.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
THAT'S AS FAR AS WE FELT WE

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
COULD GO WITHOUT MAKING THE SAME

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
MISTAKE THE SHOW MADE.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS FAIRLY

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.000
FAR.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
WE HAVE TO TAKE A SHORT

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.000
BREAK.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, I WANT TO

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
ADDRESS THE ROLE OF DAN RATHER

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
IN ALL OF THIS.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I'M BACK, WITH RICHARD

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
THORNBURGH AND LEWIS BOCCARDI.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
WE HEARD MARY MAPES AND THREE

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
EXECUTIVES OF CBS NEWS WAS SHOWN

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
THE DOOR.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
WHY WASN'T DAN RATHER HELD

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
EQUALLY ACCOUNTABLE?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
THAT'S A QUESTION YOU HAVE TO

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
PUT TO THE MANAGEMENT AT CBS.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
WE WERE NOT ASKED FOR AND DIDN'T

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
OFFER ANY SUGGESTIONS OR

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
OBSERVATIONS ON THE EMPLOYMENT

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
STATUS OF ANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
INVOLVED.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
CERTAINLY, YOU TOOK A LOOK AT

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN ALL OF

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.000
THIS?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I THINK THE BEST AUTHORITY I

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
CAN CITE FOR AN EVALUATION OF

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
MR. RATHER'S PERFORM MANS MANSE

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
IS HIS OWN ASSESSMENT, MADE 12

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
DAYS AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 8th

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.000
SEGMENT WAS SHOWN.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
HE SAID THEN, "I DIDN'T DIG HARD

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
ENOUGH, LONG ENOUGH, DIDN'T ASK

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
ENOUGH OF THE RIGHT QUESTIONS."

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
MY VIEW, THAT COULD BE DAN

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
RATHER SPEAKING FOR MOST OF THE

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
MR. BOCCARID, DID THE VETING

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
PROCESS NOT PERFORM WELL, PARTLY

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
BECAUSE OF WHO DAN RATHER IS?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
HERE YOU HAVE THE FLAGSHIP

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
ANCHORMAN AND A STAR PRODUCER

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
FOR "60 MINUTES."

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
WERE THEY ESSENTIALLY GIVEN A

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
PASS IN THE VETING PROCESS?

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I WASN'T A SAY THEY WERE

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
GIVEN A PASS.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
BUT IT WOULD BE NAIVE TO THINK

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
THAT MS. MAPES WAS REGARDED AS A

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
STAR PRODUCER.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
AND DAN HAS HAD THE CAREER THAT

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
HE'S HAD AT CBS AND IS SO MUCH

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
THE EMBODIMENT OF CBS NEWS.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
IT WOULD BE NAIVE TO THINK THAT

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
THOSE TWO FACTORS DIDN'T PLAY

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
SOME ROLE HERE.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
BUT IT'S JUST TOO SIMPLISTIC TO

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
SAY THAT THEY GOT A PASS,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
THERE WAS A VETING PROCESS.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
IT WASN'T NEARLY STRINGENT

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
ENOUGH.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
IT WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH, IN

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
GETTING THE KIND OF DETAIL THAT

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
YOU HAVE TO HAVE, IF YOU'RE

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
GOING TO MOVE THROUGH A STORY

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
LIKE THIS FOR AIR.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
AND IT BROKE DOWN ON THE ISSUE

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
OF AUTHENTICATION.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
THE VETERS NEVER REALLY HAD A

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
GOOD GRASP OF THE LEVEL OF

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
AUTHENTICATION.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
IT WAS YOUR NETWORK THAT BROUGHT

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
TO AIR TWO OF THE EXAMINERS WHO

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
HAD WARNED CBS BEFOREHAND THAT

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
THEY HAD TROUBLE WITH THESE

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.000
THINGS.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
AND ONE OF THEM, IN FACT, SAID

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
THAT EVERY -- MANY DOCUMENT

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
EXAMINERS WILL BE AFTER YOU, IF

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
YOU GO ON THE AIR WITH THIS.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
THERE IS AN OLD CLICHE IN

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
WASHINGTON, OF WHICH YOU'RE

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.000
AWARE.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
THE COVER-UP IS WORSE THAN THE

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.000
CRIME.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
ONCE THE REPORT AIRED AND

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
QUESTIONS WERE RAISED, THEY WERE

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
RAISED ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
DID CBS THEN STONE WALL THE

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.000
PROCESS?

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A STONE

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
WALL OR COVER-UP.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
BUT WHAT THEY DID DO WAS PERSIST

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
IN STANDING BY THEIR STORY, WHEN

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
ALL AROUND THEM THERE WERE

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
WARNING SIGNALS THAT THERE WERE

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
MAJOR DEFECTS IN THE STORY.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THERE WAS

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
THAT THE SAME PEOPLE THAT

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
PRODUCED THE ORIGINAL SEPTEMBER

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
8th SEGMENT, WERE IN CHARGE OF

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
THE AFTERMATH WHEN THE

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
CRITICISMS BEGAN TO MOUNT.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
THAT'S WHY WE RECOMMENDED TO CBS

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
AND WHY THEY'RE GOING TO

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
IMPLEMENT A NEW CAREER, THAT

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
WHEN THIS SITUATION ARISES AGAIN

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
THEY'LL HAVE MAJOR INPUT, FROM

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
AN INDEPENDENT TEAM THAT CAN

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
TAKE A FRESH LOOK AT THE SEGMENT

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
AND TREAT THE ON JUXS MADE AS

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
THEY SHOULD BE, BY MAKING A

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
DETAILED RE-EXAMINATION OF THE

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
PRODUCT.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
IT SEEMS THAT MAYBE MORE THAN

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
JUST RED FLAGS.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
AFTER THE STORY AIRED AND THE

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
QUESTIONS HAD BEEN RAISED, CBS

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING IT WAS

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
STANDING BY A REPORT BASED ON AN

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.000
UNIMPEACHABLE SOURCE.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
AT THAT TIME, MR. BURKETT HAD

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
BEEN IMPEACHED.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
OR AT LEAST HIS PARTISAN ROLE

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
WAS WELL-KNOWN.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
THAT WAS AN INTERESTING WORD

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
IN ONE OF THEIR STATEMENTS.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
WE WERE NEVER ABLE TO FIND OUT

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
WHERE IT CAME FROM.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
BUT THERE IT WAS IN ONE OF THE

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
PUBLIC STATEMENTS THEY ISSUED.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE, THOUGH,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
AS A NOTION THAT COVER-UP ISN'T

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
REALLY WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
COVER-UP WOULD IMPLY THEY KNEW

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
IT WAS BAD AND THEY SOMEHOW

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
TRIED TO HIDE THAT FACT.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
THING, THOUGHT IT WAS TRUE.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
AND DIDN'T LISTEN TO THE

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
CRITICISMS OR REACT TO THEM,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
UNTIL THEY HAD ENDURED THESE 12,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
ENORMOUSLY PAINFUL DAYS.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
SO, MR. THORNBURGH, AS YOU

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
STEP BACK AND TAKE A LOOK, WHAT

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
IS THE OVERRIDING LESSON IN ALL

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
OF THIS?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
WHAT IS THE MORAL TO THE STORY?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
VILLAIN IN THIS STORY, IT'S

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
PRETTY CLEAR WHO IT IS.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
IT'S HASTE.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
THE HASTE WITH WHICH THIS

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
PROGRAM WAS BROUGHT TO AIR.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
ONLY SIX DAYS AFTER THE RECEIPT

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
OF THE INITIAL DOCUMENTS.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
IT SHOULD BE A CLEAR LESSON TO

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
CBS AND OTHERS, THAT THERE'S AN

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
ENORMOUS PRICE TO PAY FOR TRYING

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
TO HUSTLE A STORY ALONG AHEAD OF

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
ITS TIME.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
VERY QUICKLY, ANY FEAR THAT

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
THIS PANEL'S REPORT, COULD

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
PRODUCE A CHILLING EFFECT THAT

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
WOULD KEEP OTHER ORGANIZATIONS

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
FROM AGGRESSIVELY REPORTING

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
CONTROVERSIAL STORIES INVOLVING

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS?

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
WELL, WE'RE SO AWARE OF THAT

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
QUESTION, THAT WE SAY TWICE IN

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
THE REPORT, WE HOPE THIS WON'T

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
BE THE CASE.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
WE HOPE THAT'S NOT THE OUTCOME

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.000
HERE.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
WE WROTE THIS AT CBS' REQUEST.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
AND WITHOUT THEIR INTERFERENCE

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
IN THE HOPE OF STRENGTHENING CBS

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
NEWS, NOT MAKING IT TIMID.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000

AND I'LL B

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
YOU MIGHT THINK THAT THOSE

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
OF US WHO COMPETE WITH CBS NEWS

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
TAKE SOME SATISFACTION OR EVEN

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
GLEE IN TODAY'S REPORT.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
IN FACT, A FAR MORE COMMON

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
THOUGHT IS, THERE BUT FOR THE

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
GRACE OF GOD, GO I.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
THAT'S BECAUSE ALL OF US FACED

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
WITH COMPETING PRESSURES OF

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
DEADLINES, ACCURACY AND FAIRNESS

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
SOMETIMES FALL SHORT, IN A

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
POLITICAL SEASON, THOSE

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
PRESSURES ARE PARTICULARLY

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
ACUTE.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
FOR JOURNALISTS, THE EASY WAY TO

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
AVOID THE MISTAKES WE HEARD

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
ABOUT TONIGHT WOULD BE TO BACK

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
OFF FROM AGGRESSIVELY REPORTING

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
ON POLITICAL FIGURES, UP TO THE

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
PERHAPS THE BETTER APPROACH

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
WOULD BE FOR EVERY NEWSROOM IN

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
AMERICA TO PROMINENTLY DISPLAY

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
THE FAMOUS SLOGAN THAT ONCE HUNG

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
IN THE OLD CITY NEWS BUREAU OF

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
CHICAGO, A TRAINING GROUND FOR

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
JOURNALISTIC LEGISLATES.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
THE SIGN READ, "IF YOU'RE MOTHER

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
SAYS SHE LOVES YOU, CHECK IT

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
OUT."

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.000
AND THAT'S OUR REPORT

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
FOR TONIGHT.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:25.000
I'M CHRIS BURY IN WASHINGTON.
