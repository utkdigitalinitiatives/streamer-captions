00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.800
WOMAN: The best thing to do
at the Grand Canyon

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.130
is to float the river.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.300
Because then you have time
to idle back your soul

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.900
to that great vastness
and that great timelessness.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.130
The first time I floated
the river,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.960
I almost was puzzled
and didn't like the fact

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.500
that I was so awestruck.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.700
Because I've seen a lot
of other wonderful places.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.730
You know, been to Glacier Bay,
have been in Yosemite,

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.700
have lived at Mount Rainier.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.400
So why should the Grand Canyon
be grabbing me so hard?

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.860
But it does.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.330
It's an amazing place when
you can really experience it.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.160
Not look at it,
but experience it.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.030
Be part of it.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.430
Hear the constancy
of the river's flow.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.860
Maybe that constancy
is a part of it,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.800
that there's something
bigger than yourself.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.100
Well, you know that,
but you don't feel it

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.830
until you get
into the Grand Canyon.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.800
To go inside, you go outside

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.630
because you need to
know yourself in context.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.800
Not the big "I"
that you usually feel you are

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.060
as you go trotting through
your daily life,

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.300
But to find that added dimension
of yourself,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.730
that innermost essential you
that is there.

[TRAIN HORN SOUNDS]

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.360
PETER COYOTE:
In late 1915,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.000
on the train ride back
from San Francisco

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.660
to their home
in Lincoln, Nebraska,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.700
Margaret and Edward Gehrke
decided to take

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.030
the one-day side excursion
to the Grand Canyon

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.130
offered by the Aitchison,
Topeka, and Sante Fe Railway.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.960
Margaret had never seen anything
like it before in her life.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.130
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE:
A few things

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.430
in this beautiful old world
are too big to talk about.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.630
One can only weep before
so supreme a spectacle of glory

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.560
and of majesty.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.960
COYOTE: Margaret was 32,
a lover of books and poetry

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.460
who had read and admired
John Muir.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.130
She taught school until shortly
after she married Edward,

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.000
a plumber who had gone into
the house-building business.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.530
Edward's passion was
dogs and fishing

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.800
and photographing
everything he saw.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.430
Margaret's was dreaming about
the yearly excursions

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.860
the childless couple
began taking

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.630
once Edward's business
started to flourish.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.700
Over the course
of nearly 30 years,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.900
Margaret would record the start
of every trip

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.200
as the "day of days"
in her journal.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.360
Edward would bring along his
Kodak camera, snapping pictures

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.800
Margaret would later carefully
place in photo albums

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.060
to commemorate their adventures.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.130
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE:
Let those who will buy land

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.800
and horde money.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.460
We will have our memories,

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.060
glad memories
of golden experiences together.

[Train horn sounds]

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.160
COYOTE:
In 1917,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.800
the Gehrkes took the Chicago,
Burlington, and Quincy line

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.830
to Yellowstone,
the nation's oldest park.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.530
Two years later,

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.060
the Great Northern took them
to Glacier National Park.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.760
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE: We
have seen much in a short time.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.260
But still I have not found
the peace I seek.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.600
I have found 5 hotels
filled with crowds.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.630
I've seen beautiful scenery,

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.560
but not the deep silence
of the hills.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.030
COYOTE: Then a boat ferried them
to a quiet spot

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.860
on the far shore
of Lake McDonald.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.030
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE:
We have a wonderful location,

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.530
camped in a forest of tall pines
overlooking the lake.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.560
At last I have found the spirit
of the woods.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.230
I shall like it here
very much.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.000
COYOTE: They lingered there
for 11 days.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.130
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE:
August 21. Our last day here.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.800
It has been all we dreamed
it would be.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.460
For in this trip
like all the others,

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.630
we have laid up
for ourselves treasures,

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.400
and we have remembered
to live.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.460
August 24, Lincoln, Nebraska.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.500
To come home
on Edward's birthday was nice,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.200
if returning home can ever
be said to be pleasant.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.630
August 27, the housekeeping
wheel begins.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.360
I swept and dusted, thoroughly
cleaned the front rooms.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.630
COYOTE: Margaret was already
dreaming of more national parks

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.330
beckoning her and Edward.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.460
And although the railroads had
introduced them to the parks,

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.360
in the future, the Gehrkes
would travel a different way.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.830
Outside their house in Lincoln
sat a new Buick,

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:38.060
1 of 17 Edward would own
in the next 20 years.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.630
MAN: At the heart of the park
idea is this notion

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:45.300
that by virtue
of being an American,

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.730
whether you're ancestors
came over on the "Mayflower"

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.930
or whether they just arrived,

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:57.300
whether you're from a big city
or from a rural setting,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.260
whether your daddy
owns the factory

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.660
or your mother is a maid,

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.700
you--you--are the owner

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.960
of some of the best seafront
property this nation's got.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.360
You own magnificent waterfalls.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.460
You own stunning views
of mountains

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:25.630
and stunning views
of gorgeous canyons.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:29.260
They belong to you.
They're yours.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.160
And all that's asked of you
is to put it in your will...

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.630
for your children so that
they can have it, too.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.900
Hopefully you won't
let it be sold off,

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.730
you won't let it be despoiled.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.630
Hopefully you'll provide

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:53.860
for proper maintenance
of this property that is yours.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.630
But that's all you've got to do.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.630
Now...that's quite a bargain.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.130
MAN:
The national parks themselves

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.430
are old as we count age
in America.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.700
But until Stephen T. Mather
conceived them

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.130
all combined as a system,

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.800
they had existed unnoticed.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.460
Suddenly our national parks
became...

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.930
our most wonderful possession,

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.730
this shining badge
of the nation's glory,

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:30.660
sharing somewhat even
of the sacredness of the flag.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.600
Robert Sterling Yard.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.560
COYOTE: In 1916,
when Stephen Mather

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.400
helped to create
the National Parks Service,

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.600
the park idea was already
50 years old in America.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.930
The parks themselves, however,

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:53.400
still existed as a haphazard
collection of scenic places,

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.560
occasionally guarded
by the army,

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.900
often ignored by Congress

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.530
and in many ways controlled
by the railroads

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.700
that had invested far more
than the federal government

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.130
in advertising the parks
and providing amenities

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.460
for the tourists
who could afford to go.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.630
Mather was determined
to change all that.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.700
He wanted more national parks.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.560
He wanted them within reach
of everyone,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.460
and he wanted them promoted
to the American people

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.130
as 1 cohesive system.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.530
But with no clear precedence
to guide them,

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.330
he and his young assistant,
Horace Albright,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.530
would instead have to rely
on their own judgment

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.700
to determine the future
of the parks.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.760
As the nation entered the 1920s,

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.330
when a growing prosperity
permitted more and more people

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.230
to escape the crowded cities
of the East,

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.460
Mather and Albright's efforts

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.560
would bring Americans
to their parks as never before.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.860
To do it, they would ally
themselves with the machine

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.860
that was already rapidly
transforming American life.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.860
But almost from the start,
some park supporters worried

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.860
that they had made a pact
with the devil.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.360
MAN:
I heard the other day

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.330
that a question's been raised

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.030
as to whether automobiles
should be admitted

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.200
in the Yosemite Valley.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.060
May a word be permitted
on that subject?

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:30.960
If Adam had known what harm
the serpent was going to work,

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.800
he would have tried
to prevent him

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.860
from finding lodgment in Eden.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.800
And if you stop to realize

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.800
what the result
of the automobile

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.630
will be on that wonderful,
that incomparable valley,

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.600
you will keep it out.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:52.300
Do not let the serpent
enter Eden at all.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.560
Lord James Bryce.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.030
MAN:
The first idea of national parks

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.200
seems to have been that

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.960
they were stupendous
natural spectacles.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.200
Then came the great
out-of-doors movement.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.960
And people turned
to the national parks

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.730
as places to live
during their vacations.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.800
Lastly comes the realization

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.400
that our parks are not only
showplaces and vacation lands,

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.460
but also vast schoolrooms
of Americanism,

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.400
where people are
studying, enjoying,

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.800
and learning to love more deeply
this land in which they live.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.560
Stephen Mather.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.460
COYOTE: For Stephen Mather,

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.530
being the first director of
the National Parks Service

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.300
was more than
a civil service job.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.030
It was a calling
to a noble cause,

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.730
something so compelling

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.760
it had drawn him away
from private industry

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.000
where his business skills
and genius for promotion

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
had made him a millionaire
several times over.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.030
He could be a whirlwind
of action,

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.760
and his intense energy
and friendliness

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.300
had earned him the nickname
the eternal freshman.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:29.260
But Mather was also prone to
crippling spells of depression,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.130
mental collapses that
required hospitalization.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:37.960
He always found the solace and
rejuvenation he needed so badly

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.900
in the parks.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.060
No Mather wanted all Americans

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.730
to experience
that healing power.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:51.460
But he realized that until
more people started showing up,

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.560
Congress would never create
more parks

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.030
or even support
the existing ones.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.630
MAN: He was at heart
a public relations man

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.700
and wanted the country to be
aware of the national parks.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.030
There never could be too many
tourists for Stephen Mather.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:13.900
He wanted as many as possible
to enjoy these treasures,

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.230
no matter how
they got to the parks.

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.130
Horace Albright.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.530
COYOTE:
Mather and Horace Albright

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:26.500
were willing to try almost
anything to lure visitors.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:31.960
They approved golf courses,
zoos, even a summer race track

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.830
at different parks

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:37.460
and proposed Yosemite
as an ideal setting

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.560
to host the winter Olympics.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.660
In Yellowstone,

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.660
Albright arranged for
a buffalo plains week

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.360
in which cowboys
and Crow Indians

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.830
stampeded the park's bison herd

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.630
for tourists arriving
by buckboard.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:57.600
He also allowed a movie crew
to film the stampede

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.430
for a Hollywood western
called "The Thundering Herd."

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.630
Albright even considered

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.900
stringing a cable car
across the Grand Canyon,

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.500
but the idea was
ultimately rejected

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.760
because Mather realized
it would ruin the view.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.260
MAN AS STEPHEN MATHER:
This is a new agency.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.900
MAN: Mather and Albright
are building something

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.860
that has not existed before.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.400
So they're trying to do
the right things

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.830
and trying to understand
what the American people

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.500
are going to want
from their parks in the future.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.330
And they're struggling
with all kinds of advice.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.160
They're getting advice
from biologists

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.130
not to eradicate the predators

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.600
and they're getting advice
from the locals

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.030
that there should be more
commercial pursuits.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.500
For Mather, recreation
was the absolute center

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.800
of what the parks
were supposed to be

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.930
and recreation
and entertainment.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:54.130
And so he very much is
into the parks as spectacle.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.300
COYOTE: But of all the judgments
Mather made in the early years,

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.400
none would have a greater impact

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.300
on the number of people
visiting national parks

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.960
than his decision to embrace
the automobile.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.700
Mather's hero, John Muir,
had harbored mixed feelings

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.360
about the horseless carriage.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.360
"Blunt-nosed
mechanicalbeetlesbeatles,"
he called them,

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.430
"that might mingle
their gas breath

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:23.460
"with the fresh air of pines
and waterfalls."

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.430
Though Muir also admitted

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.900
they might help create
new allies for the parks

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.800
if they were allowed in
under certain restrictions.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.360
Stephen Mather
had no such qualms.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:43.160
By 1918, tourists arriving
in Yosemite by automobile

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.200
outnumbered those
coming by train 7-1,

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.300
and by the end of 1920,
Mather proudly announced

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.600
that for the first time
in history,

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.960
the number of people
visiting the parks

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.600
exceeded one million a year.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:03.760
"The automobile," Mather said,
"has been the open sesame."

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.230
MAN: The advent
of the automobile

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.330
was the great
democratizing factor.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:23.200
Suddenly anyone who owned a car
could come to the park,

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.300
could make the drive,
could go around the park

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:31.660
and see it with no guide,
with no tie to the hotels,

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.960
with no tie to
the stagecoach operation

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.460
that was entrenched.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.830
You could just
camp out along the way,

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.860
you know, at your own expense.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.000
MAN: The automobile is
the devil's bargain

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
because as more people
pour into the national parks

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.200
in automobiles, they need
a place to park,

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.460
and they start by parking
anywhere they can.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.900
They start by parking
in the meadows.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.630
They start by parking
along the roads.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:59.000
They begin to become a menace
of the whole idea

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.030
of a pristine
natural environment

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.400
that you view
from a community setting,

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.630
such as a stagecoach
or a motorbus.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.400
COYOTE: Mather joined forces
with automobile clubs,

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.730
chambers of commerce,
good roads associations,

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.800
local governments,
and car manufacturers

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.200
to lobby for a national
park-to-park highway,

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.760
a 6,000-mile loop
of improved roads

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.400
linking all the western parks.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.130
"It would be,"
he predicted in 1921,

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.060
"the greatest scenic highway
in the world,"

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.230
one that would unleash
what he called

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.830
"the great flow of tourist gold

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.400
"into every community
along its route."

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.330
In 1925, Mather told
his park superintendents

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:59.000
he wanted them all to gather
at Mesa Verde.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.330
To get there, however,

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:04.300
they were explicitly instructed
not to take the train.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.730
They were to form car caravans

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.330
and travel together
on the park-to-park highway

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:15.000
and make as much news about it
as possible along the way.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.800
It was a classic
Mather publicity stunt,

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.660
and it was a huge success.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:27.530
That year, visitation at
national parks topped 2 million

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:28.900
for the first time.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.100
MAN AS STEPHEN MATHER:
In the national parks

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.760
there is one thing that
the motorists are doing,

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.100
and that is making them
a great melting pot

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.760
for the American people.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.600
This will go far in developing
a love and pride

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.100
in our own country

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:49.060
and a realization of
what a wonderful place it is.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.760
There is no way
to bring it home to them

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.100
in a better way than by going
from park to park

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.700
through the medium
of an automobile

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.660
and camping out in the open.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.660
It is just by trips of that kind

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.360
that people learn
what America is.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:23.330
MAN: It was great that
we created national parks,

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:28.760
but we created rangers
to personify national parks.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:34.530
It's...it's Yosemite
talking to you.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.500
It was Theodore Roosevelt
and John Muir

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.000
and George Bird Grinnell

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.930
all those guys rolled into one.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.060
And standing there
in front of you,

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.930
giving you a talk by a campfire.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.130
The romance and magic of that,

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:54.660
and as near as I can tell,
it's never faded.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.830
COYOTE: In the past, political
patronage had determined

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.300
who got jobs in the parks.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:06.200
A well-connected employee
at Glacier National Park

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.560
was so inept

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:11.230
his patrols were restricted to
following the railroad tracks

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.660
to keep him from getting lost.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:19.260
The son-in-law of an early
Mesa Verde superintendent

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.230
turned out to be responsible

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.500
for the looting
of precious artifacts

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.900
from the ancient
cliff dwellings.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:28.830
To institute changes,

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.660
Stephen Mather
quickly began hand-picking

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.000
new superintendents.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.330
Jesse Nussbaum,
a professional archaeologist,

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:41.530
was put in charge of Mesa Verde
and its treasures.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:45.330
John White was
an English-born adventurer

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.660
who had scoured the Klondike
for gold

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.830
and fought in 3 wars,

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.730
but he had gladly taken
a low-paying job

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.000
just to be at the Grand Canyon,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.660
until Mather and Albright
recognized

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.830
his leadership skills
could be put to better use

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:04.430
as superintendent
of Sequoia National Park,

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:08.700
where White would serve for more
than a quarter of a century.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:13.400
The most prestigious post,
superintendent of Yellowstone,

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.400
was entrusted
to Horace Albright.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.900
"I felt so desperately young,"
he later remembered,

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.500
"I just prayed
to be 30 years old."

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.500
To appear more mature,

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.130
he took to wearing eyeglasses
in public.

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.300
MAN AS HORACE ALBRIGHT:
If you cannot work hard

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.460
10 or 12 hours a day

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.200
and always with patience
and a smile on your face,

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.000
don't fill out
the attached blank.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.930
Apply if you are qualified.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:47.000
Otherwise, please plan to visit
the Yellowstone National Park

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.760
as a tourist.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.830
COYOTE: Underneath
the superintendents,

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:57.330
Mather wanted a cadre of equally
professional park rangers.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:02.060
"Men between the ages
of 21 and 40," Albright said,

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:05.160
"of good character,
sound physique,

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.760
"and tactful
in handling people."

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:13.330
They needed to be able to ride
and take care of horses,

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.630
build trails,
fight forest fires,

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.530
handle a rifle and pistol,

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:22.560
have practical experience
in surviving every extreme

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.430
of weather in the out of doors,

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.830
and be willing to work
long hours

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:29.960
with no provisions
for overtime pay.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.600
The salary was
$1,000 a year.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.560
From that, rangers were expected
to buy their own food,

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.360
provide their own bedding,

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:44.130
and pay $45 for the symbol
of the job they had chosen:

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.530
a specially designed uniform

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:51.500
topped by a distinctive
flat-brimmed hat.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.360
MAN: And that marvelous
flat hat, that cavalry hat,

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.860
is just like a magnet to
millions of visitors every year.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.160
There's something special

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.830
about the park ranger uniform
and that hat.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:11.300
Steve Mather and Horace Albright
saw in the park ranger

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:16.330
an opportunity to sell the whole
idea of national parks.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.800
MAN AS STEPHEN MATHER:
If a trail is to be blazed,

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.000
it is, "send the ranger."

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.760
If an animal is floundering
in the snow,

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.830
a ranger is sent
to pull him out.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:32.900
If a bear is in the hotel,
if a fire threatens a forest,

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:37.660
if someone is to be saved,
it is "send a ranger."

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:42.160
If a dude wants to know the why
of nature's ways,

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.860
if a sage-brusher
is puzzled about a road,

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:50.660
his first thought,
"ask a ranger."

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.600
COYOTE: And the man
every ranger looked up to

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.830
was Stephen Mather.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.830
He once gave a ranger
travel money

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:01.230
to make a cross-country trip
to visit his parents.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:04.730
Occasionally treated rangers and
their wives

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.100
to meals at fancy restaurants,

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:12.000
and in Yosemite, spent $25,000
from his own pocket

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.330
to build the ranger's clubhouse,

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.700
a place where they could relax
in private.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.430
Mather himself
took to staying there

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.060
instead of
in one of Yosemite's hotels

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.930
whenever he visited the park.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.930
Impressed by
an educational nature program

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:34.500
run by 2 college professors at
a private resort at Lake Tahoe,

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:39.200
Mather paid to have the whole
thing transferred to Yosemite.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.660
Soon guided nature walks
and evening campfire lectures

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.500
by what he called
ranger naturalists

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.700
were being inaugurated
in every national park,

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.300
where they quickly became

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.660
one of the park service's
most popular programs

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.660
and did more than anything else

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.230
to burnish the image
of friendly professionalism

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:03.830
Mather was trying to create.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:07.730
MAN: They are the people
who have the answers

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:11.400
to the questions
that the parks pose

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.630
when you come into a park.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:16.160
Who were these people
that built these roads?

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.430
How did this great chasm
get created?

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.700
What kind of bird
and what kind of flower is that?

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.200
It prompts all these questions
in you

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.000
that you want answer to.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.230
The ranger is the one
that you go to for the answers.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:33.830
You know, I think I got
a pretty good education,

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:36.330
but I don't know if I'm proud
or sorry to say

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.760
that most of the science
that I know

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.330
I learned at a national park
as an adult,

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.600
and a good deal of my history,
too.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.160
I learned from a ranger
telling me, explaining to me

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.830
as I was just cascading
questions toward them.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.500
COYOTE: Most of the rangers
were men,

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.600
but a few were women.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.460
At age 18, Clara Marie Hodges,

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.660
who knew Yosemite's trails
as well as anyone,

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:08.530
became the Park Service's
first woman ranger.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:12.230
At Yellowstone,
Isabel Bassett Wasson

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:15.600
a Brooklyn native with
a Master's degree in geology

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.600
from Columbia University,

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.230
gave lectures at 3 different
locations each day,

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.660
each one on a different topic,

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.900
because crowds followed her
wherever she went.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.030
WOMAN:
Park rangers have collections

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:35.330
of silly questions because
we so enjoy them.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:39.100
What time do the moose come out
for pictures at Isle Royale?

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:42.500
Wind Cave has
one of my favorites.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:47.130
The rangers there occasionally
get asked what the cave weighs.

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:52.260
DUNCAN: How much of this cave
is underground?

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:58.360
How many miles of this cavern
haven't been discovered yet?

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:02.160
Why did the Indians build their
ruins so close to the road?

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.730
MAN: And you could be
a naturalist...

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:09.430
if you knew the answer
to 3 questions:

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:12.230
Where's the restroom?
How far is Las Vegas?

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.060
And what's the fastest way
out of here?

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.960
That was the 3 questions.

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.000
[Birds chirping]

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.300
[Woodpecker pecking]

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.460
MAN: Whenever someone enters
a national park,

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.500
it's like going
to another world.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.200
And I think that people
feel that transition,

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.830
the feel that sense that they've
gone to someplace better

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.600
than what they've left behind,

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.960
but the irony is
that where they've gone

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.000
is the place
where they've always been.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.230
It's just now
they understand it,

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:12.060
now they see it,
now they feel it

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.260
because parks are like
going home.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.500
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE:
July 15.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.930
This is Colorado.

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:26.930
Ahead, the snow-covered peaks
and cool pines

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:30.000
and a long trail
into the unknown.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:36.160
About 20 miles out
of Fort Morgan we made camp,

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.900
where mosquitoes
made supper and sleep

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.930
an interesting undertaking.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:44.860
Mosquitoes won.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:51.430
COYOTE: In July of 1921,
Margaret and Edward Gehrke

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.600
set off on their most
adventurous trip ever:

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.760
a 3-month journey covering
more than 7,000 miles,

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:03.500
adding more national parks
to their growing list.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.660
The Gehrkes were traveling
in their new Buick,

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.230
auto camping across the West,

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:12.230
picking each day's
itinerarythemselves

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.660
and stopping for the night
wherever the mood hit them.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.160
Schoolyards, municipal parks,

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.100
or simply on the side
of the road.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:25.200
To keep them company, they
brought along their pet dog,

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.600
an Airedale named Barney.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.260
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE:
75 miles this day

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.260
over splendidly graveled roads.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:40.400
The freedom, the joy,
the ecstasy one feels

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.500
when he is going into
the mountains that lie ahead.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.360
The steady purr
of the speeding car

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.260
that bears one on
past unfamiliar fields.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.830
COYOTE: At Rocky Mountain
National Park,

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:57.160
they drove over
the continental divide

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.000
on the Fall River Road,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.760
which the Park Service had
completed only a year earlier.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.860
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE:
July 19.

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.360
We shall long remember
going over this new path

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.800
from Estes to Grand Lake.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:16.230
A ride of 40 miles
of indescribable scenery

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:20.730
and some stretches
of inconceivable roads.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:24.760
Altitude: 11,000-plus.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.530
COYOTE: From Rocky Mountain
they pushed westward,

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:32.000
across Utah and Nevada
to Northern California,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.760
where they learned that
the visit Margaret had planned

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.830
to Lassen Volcanic National Park
would now be impossible

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:42.330
because the mountain roads
were in such bad shape.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:46.160
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE:
It would be sensible not to go.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.430
But to be sensible
is to be commonplace.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:52.500
To be commonplace
is unpardonable.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.830
[Thunder]

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:55.960
I shall regret his decision.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:58.330
[Bird chirping]

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.400
COYOTE: They had better luck
in Oregon

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.900
at Crater Lake National Park.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.230
They circled it on the newly
completed 35-mile Rim Road,

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:11.760
"one of the great scenic
highways of the West,"

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.560
Margaret noted in her journal.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:18.530
And motored on
to Astoria, Oregon,

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:21.900
reaching the Pacific Ocean
near the same spot

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.830
where the Lewis and Clark
expedition

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:28.260
had spent the winter
of 1805-1806,

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.500
after becoming
the first American citizens

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.260
to cross the continent.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.900
Five days later,

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:40.160
the Gehrkes reached
yet another national park.

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:43.330
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE:
In camping tonight

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:45.500
here at the foot of Mt. Rainier,

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.760
its great summit covered
with immaculate snow,

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:53.200
its outline in sharp contrast
against the sky,

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.160
the clear bright stars above,

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.060
the icy chill of thin air,

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:02.630
a secret dream of my heart
has been realized.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.160
And here I give thanks.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:11.430
COYOTE: The Gehrkes' trip
had only whetted their appetite

00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:14.230
for more trips
over the coming years,

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:18.060
and Edward's revolving parade
of new Buicks

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:21.730
always with new parks
as their destination.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:29.000
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE:
September 25, 1922.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.860
Mt. Desert Island
off the coast of Maine.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.730
We have arrived.

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:39.230
The tall pines about remind me
a little of Glacier.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:42.000
The lake with its
low range about it

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.130
a trifle of Grand Lake
at Rocky Mountains.

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:48.830
So we sleep tonight and rejoice

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:53.000
in spite of a cold wind
impossible to keep out.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:58.830
July 30, 1923.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.500
Wind Cave National Park.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:07.230
We took the medium-length trail
devoting 4 hours to the tour.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:11.060
We have visited
our eighth national park.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:16.060
November 30, 1923.

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:20.130
Arrived in time for a full day
of seeing hot springs.

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:22.600
Our ninth national park.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:28.460
August 24, 1925.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.630
We are off into Mesa Verde.

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:35.260
For 31 miles,
we wound and wound,

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:38.360
round and round,
up and up.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:42.260
First the switchback road
with its sharp-grade curves,

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:46.500
then the knife-edge highway
and Mesa Verde.

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:49.460
Here it was.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:53.000
Scrubby little pinion trees,
canyon,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.400
and spruce tree house over there
in full sight.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.900
Altogether different
than we had expected.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.400
COYOTE:
Mesa Verde meant that 12 parks

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.030
had been checked off
Margaret's list.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.730
Like many other Americans,

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:18.700
the Gehrkes realized they were
now collecting parks.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.830
DUNCAN: In the early days,
when you came into a park,

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:26.660
you had to pay a fee
if you brought an automobile.

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.330
And so they'd give you
this sticker

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.830
that you would put
on your windshield.

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:35.800
And after a while, people sort
of saw that as, you know,

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.600
proof that they'd been to parks,

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.830
and they decided, well,
I'll start, you know,

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.160
collecting parks.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.530
I will try to get
all of the parks.

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:48.660
I'll try to go to all of them
and get my stickers.

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.300
Now you don't have the stickers.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:54.060
You get a little passport
that you can get stamped

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.160
when you come into it,
as your proof,

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.500
if you suffer
from this obsession,

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.230
and you get these little stamps.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:05.560
I thought that
I was pretty obsessed

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.900
with these kind of things,

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:10.430
and then we met a guy
named Tuan Luong.

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:16.100
He was born in Paris
to Vietnamese parents.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:19.230
Got a degree
in artificial intelligence,

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.400
became an avid rock climber

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.000
and decided he wanted
to continue rock climbing

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.260
and so he did his post-graduate
work in California

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:31.930
so he could be close
to El Capitan and Yosemite.

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:37.630
And he soon decided that
he wanted to photograph

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:41.500
in every national park,
and so he set out to do it,

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:46.030
and he takes these
incredible photographs...

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:51.700
and he has now taken photographs
in every national park

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.660
that exists
in the United States today,

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:57.000
all 58 national parks.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.830
So you see this is,
structurally this--

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:05.900
this is the first edition
of the National Geographic guide

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:08.000
to the national parks.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:16.760
And so what I have is that
on this first page here

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.930
I put a stamp for each
of the parks that I visited.

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:26.330
And, well, I've visited
all of them so far.

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:28.500
There is the 58.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:32.230
Some of them, they are just
somewhat faded.

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:37.360
I photograph in all the 58
with my camera,

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.430
and I think I'm the only
photographer to have done so.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.400
MAN:
The dreamy blue haze

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.830
that ever hovers
over the mountains

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:11.360
softens all outlines,

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:15.000
lends a mirage-like effect
of great distance

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.060
to objects that are
but a few miles off,

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:23.000
while those farther removed
grow more and more intangible

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.130
until finally the skyline blends
with the sky itself.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.300
There are 7 peaks
of 6,000 feet altitude

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.600
that still have no name.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.460
Could anything better prove
the astonishing isolation

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.900
of this majestic region

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:49.630
though set as it is in the very
midst of American civilization?

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.530
Horace Kephart.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.460
COYOTE: When Horace Kephart
had first come

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:00.860
to the Smoky Mountains
of North Carolina and Tennessee

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:04.360
in 1904, he was a broken man.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.160
Precociously brilliant,

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.760
he had entered college
at age 13,

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:14.330
enrolled as a graduate student
at Cornell when he turned 17,

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:18.160
took a prestigious job
in Yale University's library,

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.600
and got married
before he was 25.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.860
As head of the St. Louis
Mercantile Library,

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.330
he had gone on
to make a name for himself

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:31.000
as an expert on early
western explorations.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.900
But his marriage proved unhappy.

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:38.060
Kephart turned
to heavy drinking,

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:41.130
and when he lost his job
and his wife left him,

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:43.200
taking their 6 children
with her,

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.000
he had suffered a breakdown.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:50.160
At age 42, he decided
to start over

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.430
in a place where he could
lose himself in the wilderness

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:56.060
and find a new purpose
for his life.

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:59.830
He chose the Smoky Mountains,
"which seemed," he wrote,

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:04.560
"like an Eden, still unpeopled
and unspoiled."

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:09.930
MAN AS HORACE KEPHART: When I
went south into the mountains,

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:13.330
I was seeking a back of beyond.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.860
I yearned for a strange land

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:21.630
and a people that had the charm
of originality.

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:27.160
I wanted to enjoy a free life
in the open air,

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.660
the thrill of exploring
new ground.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:35.030
Here, in the wild wood,
I have found peace,

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:38.930
cleanliness,
health of body and mind.

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:45.330
COYOTE: The Smokies
are the tallest mountains

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:47.260
in the Appalachian chain,

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:50.800
hosting the world's greatest
diversity of plant, animal,

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.200
and insect life of any region
in a temperate climate zone.

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:59.160
Including more than
100 species of native trees,

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:02.860
spruce and hemlock,
giant tulip poplars

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:04.400
and chestnut oaks.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.930
A greater variety of trees
than in all of Europe.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:13.700
For centuries, it had been
the home of the Cherokees,

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.430
until most of them were
forced from their land

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:19.400
and sent to Oklahoma
on what came to be known

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.360
as the Trail of Tears.

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:24.960
In their place,
other people had settled

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.700
in the remote mountaintops
and hollows.

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:32.930
Isolate farmers, moonshiners,
Confederate deserters,

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:37.230
and Union sympathizers hiding
out during the Civil War;

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:40.000
Cherokees who had
evaded removal,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.100
and a collection of other people
like Horace Kephart

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:50.030
on the run for one reason
or another from civilization.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.230
MAN AS HORACE KEPHART:
Seldom during my forest exile

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:54.660
did I feel lonesome
in the daytime.

00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:59.360
But when supper
would be over

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.730
and black night closed in
on my hermitage,

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:07.430
and the owls began calling all
the blue devils of the woods,

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:10.830
one needed
some indoor occupation

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:12.830
to keep him in good cheer,

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:17.200
and that is how I came to write
my first little book.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.660
COYOTE: Kephart's book,
"Camping and Woodcraft,"

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:26.000
a guidebook for those
who travel in the wilderness,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.600
became known as
the camper's bible.

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.200
He quickly published
another book,

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.860
"Our Southern Highlanders,"

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.030
about the people
living around him

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:38.630
in the place
he now considered home.

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.560
He proposed that
the Smoky Mountains

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:46.530
be made into a national park.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:51.460
Otherwise, he feared the great
woods would suffer the same fate

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:54.900
as nearly all the other
eastern forests.

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:00.130
MAN AS HORACE KEPHART: I am not
a very religious man.

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:04.430
But often when standing alone
before my maker

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:07.600
in this house
not made with hands,

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:12.430
I bowed my head with reverence
and thanked God for his gift

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:15.960
of the great forest
to one who loved it.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.760
[Chopping]

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.200
Not long ago I went
to that same place again.

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:29.660
It was wrecked, ruined,
desecrated,

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.300
turned into a thousand
rubbish heaps,

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.200
utterly vile and mean.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:40.160
Did anyone ever thank God
for a lumberman slashing?

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.360
COYOTE:
Giant lumber companies

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:47.130
were buying up large parcels
of land at cheap prices,

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:50.830
hiring local workers
at equally cheap wages

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:54.200
and beginning to systematically
strip the mountains

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.430
of their forest canopy.

00:45:56.430 --> 00:46:00.660
This was logging on
a new industrial scale.

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:07.430
Railroads were extended
into nearly every valley,

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:11.300
bringing steam-powered skidders
and log loaders

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.430
to handle the massive trees

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:16.460
of the previously
untouched woodlands.

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.900
Cornfields were transformed
into sawmills,

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.460
and towns sprang up
around them.

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:25.600
Farther up
toward the mountain peaks,

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.530
portable housing
called string towns

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:32.860
were assembled to keep
the workers close to their jobs.

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:35.300
When one section was cleared,

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:39.660
they moved everything still
farther up and began again.

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.960
By the mid-1920s,

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:47.230
more than 300,000 acres
had been clear-cut.

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:50.230
"Much of the Smokies,"
one resident said,

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:52.360
"looked as if
it had been skinned."

00:46:55.730 --> 00:47:00.830
Of the 100,000 acres of
virgin forest still remained.

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:05.060
Kephart and others like him
wanted those trees spared.

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:08.300
"I owe my life
to these mountains," he said.

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:19.100
Among those joining the cause
was another man

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:22.930
who, like Kephart, had arrived
as a stranger.

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:28.460
Masahara Izuka
born in Osaka, Japan, in 1881,

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:31.600
had come to the United States
to study mining,

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:35.530
though by 1915 his
university days were over

00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:39.830
and he had permanently severed
ties with his family in Japan.

00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:43.360
He was wandering the country
in search of a job--

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.500
Colorado, St. Louis,
New Orleans--

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:50.630
When his travels brought him
to Asheville, North Carolina

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:53.100
at the edge of the Smokies.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:56.030
MAN AS MASAHARA IZUKA: This is
a mountainous area.

00:47:56.030 --> 00:48:00.430
It will be cold enough to
require a blanket in the autumn.

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:02.500
No mosquitoes.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.700
An excellent place to live.

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.200
Nothing can be better.

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:11.760
Now, if only I make
a lot of money.

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.760
COYOTE: He changed his name
to George Masa,

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.100
set about to learn
better English,

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:19.530
and took a position
in the laundry room

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:22.900
at Ashville's exclusive
Grove Park Inn.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:26.400
He was soon promoted
to the valet desk,

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:29.430
where his intelligence
and gentle friendliness

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:33.300
made him a favorite of
the hotel's elite clientele.

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.530
To make a little extra money,

00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:50.200
Masa began processing the film
and printing photographs

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.200
from the guests' cameras,

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:55.260
a skill that quickly blossomed
into a new job

00:48:55.260 --> 00:49:00.300
with a professional photographer
and then a business of his own.

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:05.400
Though barely 5 feet tall and
weighing just over 100 pounds,

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.560
he lugged his heavy
camera equipment everywhere,

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.530
searching the Smokies
for a new vantage point,

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:17.330
Then waiting for hours for the
perfect light to take a picture.

00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:27.760
The local chamber of commerce
eventually bought his photos

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:30.500
to promote the region
in their brochures.

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:34.730
Masa turned some of them
into color postcards

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:36.630
for sale to tourists.

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.700
His love of the mountains
inevitable brought him

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:46.060
into contact with the man who
had been trying to do with words

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:49.230
what Masa was now doing
with photographs.

00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:53.030
MAN AS HORACE KEPHART:
I have been out with George

00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:54.860
on several of his trips,

00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:58.860
exploring the wildest
and most rugged parts,

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:01.700
scaling precipitous
mountainsides,

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:04.360
devling rocky defiles,

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.860
where no sign has been left
by man.

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:12.400
COYOTE: Horace Kephart quickly
became Masa's closest friend

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:16.760
and easily recruited him into
the crusade to save the Smokies.

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:21.730
Others were joining as well.

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:25.300
Community leaders in Asheville
and in Knoxville, Tennessee,

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:27.160
got on the bandwagon.

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:29.630
Some out of a love
of the mountains;

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:34.000
some in the belief that tourism
would result in better roads

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.060
and bolster the local economy.

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.860
A New York publicity firm,

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:42.430
brought in by
the Knoxville Automobile Club,

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:44.930
suggested that the group
call itself

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:49.300
the Great Smoky Mountain
Conservation Association.

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:52.130
The name caught on.

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:54.460
Soon the mountains themselves

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.600
were referred to
as the Great Smokies.

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:01.030
On the North Carolina side,

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:03.860
boosters published
a promotional booklet

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:09.160
with 5 photographs by George
Masa and text by Horace Kephart.

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:12.530
MAN AS HORACE KEPHART:
We have 18 national parks

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:14.860
in the West.

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:19.300
They comprise an area
of over 11,000 square miles.

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:23.100
East of the Mississippi River,
there is but 1,

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.930
far up on the Maine Coast,

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:29.160
and it covers
only 8 sqaure miles.

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.830
Three-fourths
of the American people

00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:33.830
live east of the Mississippi.

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:38.800
Most of them cannot afford
the time or the money

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:42.130
that must be spent to visit
the western parks.

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:48.030
COYOTE: In 1926, with
the support of Stephen Mather,

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:52.500
Congress authorized the creation
of 3 new southern parks:

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:57.730
in Virginia and Kentucky as
well as in the Smoky Mountains.

00:51:57.730 --> 00:52:00.060
But there was a hitch.

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:03.300
Congress insisted
that the money to buy the land

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.630
come from the states
or private donations.

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:09.860
The federal governemnt
would not put in a penny.

00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:15.560
In Tennessee and North Carolina,

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:19.260
a fundraising goal was set
at $10 million,

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:22.160
which seemed
an impossibly lofty figure

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.860
for one of the poorest sections
of the country.

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:31.030
But people from all walks of
life rallied to the cause.

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:35.700
Local ministers held special
Smoky Mountain Sunday services

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:38.900
to encourage their congregations
to contribute.

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:42.930
Bellboys at the Farragut Hotel
in Knoxville

00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:45.230
donated a dollar each.

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:51.030
Students in the city's
high school pledged $2,490,

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:55.460
including the entire proceeds
from the junior class play.

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:59.700
Asheville's newspaper reported
major contributions

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:02.060
of $1,000 and higher

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:05.200
from prominent businesses
and families...

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:09.200
as well as donations
from every grade school,

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:13.660
white and black, in the city's
segregated school district.

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:16.930
Children were raiding
their piggybanks

00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:19.530
for pennies and nickels.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:27.200
The logging industry fought back
with full-page advertisements

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.900
in local newspapers,

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:32.360
arguing that a national park
would ruin their business

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:35.430
and eliminate the jobs
that went with it.

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:40.360
Meanwhile, they were frantically
cutting the old-growth forests

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.400
within the proposed
park boundaries,

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:47.060
60 acres a day
according to 1 estimate,

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:49.800
hoping to extract
everything they could

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:53.060
before the land was closed
to them.

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:58.030
By the Spring of 1927, the fund
drive to save the Great Smokies

00:53:58.030 --> 00:54:02.230
had reached $5 million
in cash and pledges.

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:05.230
But it was only half
of what was needed.

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:10.030
Kephart, Masa,
and other park supporters

00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:12.760
were now caught
in a race against time

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:14.730
and the loggers' saw.

00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:17.930
And time was running out.

00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:19.360
[Bird screeches]

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:56.630
MAN AS J.B. PRIESTLY:
If I were an American,

00:54:56.630 --> 00:55:00.830
I should make my remembrance
of it the final test

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:05.130
of men, art, and poesy.

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:11.260
I should ask my self,
is this good enough to exist

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:14.860
in the same country
as the canyon?

00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:19.500
How would I feel about this man,
this kind of art,

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:24.260
these political measures
if I were near that rim?

00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:30.200
Every member or officer
of the federal government

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:34.360
ought to remind himself
with triumphant pride...

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:41.260
that he is on the staff
of the Grand Canyon.

00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:44.130
J.B. Priestly.

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.200
MAN: For more than 16 years,

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.200
I have been exploring
and working

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:56.730
in the Grand Canyon of Arizona
on power sites.

00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:59.500
I now have the financial backing

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:02.430
to build 2 huge
hydroelectric plants

00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:04.000
in the Grand Canyon

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.600
to electrify every railroad,
mine, city, town, and hamlet

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.430
in Arizona.

00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:12.760
Senator Ralph Henry Cameron.

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:16.460
COYOTE: Since before the turn
of the century,

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:19.660
Ralph Henry Cameron had
considered the Grand Canyon

00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:22.230
his own private fiefdom.

00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:26.360
In 1919, he had lost
a prolonged fight

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:29.760
to keep the canyon from becoming
an national park,

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:33.730
and a series of court rulings
had ordered him to abandon

00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:36.400
many of the questionable
mining claims

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.730
he had used to gain
effective control

00:56:38.730 --> 00:56:41.360
of some particularly
scenic spots,

00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:43.800
including
the Bright Angel Trail,

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:48.330
the main path from the Canyon
rim to the Colorado River.

00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:51.700
But after being elected
to represent Arizona

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:53.100
in the U.S. Senate,

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:56.700
Cameron carried on
as if nothing had changed.

00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:59.630
Despite repeated
court injunctions,

00:56:59.630 --> 00:57:02.760
he simply refused to remove
his buildings.

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.760
And through his tight grip

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:07.560
on the political machine
of northern Arizona,

00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:12.600
prevented any action from being
taken to make him comply.

00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:14.930
Park rangers opposed to him

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:18.100
resorted to having their mail
sent in code

00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:21.230
because they suspected that
the canyon's postmaster,

00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:24.700
Cameron's brother-in-law,
was opening their letters.

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:30.130
When Cameron proposed
2 giant hydroelectric dams

00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:32.600
and a platinum mine
within the park,

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:36.530
Stephen Mather decided
the senator had gone too far

00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:40.130
and set out to stop him
and all the other developers

00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:44.400
who were planning dams
in other national parks.

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:47.800
Mather did what
he always did best,

00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.160
galvanizing public support.

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:54.600
Newspapers, women's clubs,
and conservation groups

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:57.530
rallied to the cause
and lobbied congress

00:57:57.530 --> 00:58:01.830
to keep dams out of
any existing national park.

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:05.260
No one wanted
another Hetch Hetchy.

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:07.330
MAN AS STEPHEN MATHER:
Can we not preserve

00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:09.860
a few of our magnificent lakes,

00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:13.930
a few of
the priceless waterfalls

00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:17.100
without encountering
the grasping, calloused hand

00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:18.430
of commercialism

00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:22.830
extended to deprive our children
of their heritage?

00:58:22.830 --> 00:58:28.360
Once a small dam is authorized,
other dams will follow.

00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:31.360
One misstep is fatal.

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:35.030
COYOTE: Proposed dams
in Sequoia, Glacier,

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:37.300
and Yellowstone were stopped.

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.100
And in the Grand Canyon,

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:44.460
all of Cameron's projects
were stopped, too.

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:46.200
[Thunder]

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:49.630
Ralph Cameron took any
opposition to his plans

00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:51.030
personally.

00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:53.200
Now he lashed out.

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:56.100
He managed to have
the entire appropriation

00:58:56.100 --> 00:59:00.960
for Grand Canyon National Park
removed from the senate budget.

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:03.860
He denounced Mather
on the senate floor

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:07.000
and instigated
a congressional investigation

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.930
that traveled from park to park,

00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:12.100
trying to embarrass both Mather
and Albright

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:16.260
by stirring up spurious claims
against their integrity.

00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:18.500
But it all backfired.

00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:23.100
Newspapers began their own
investigations into Cameron,

00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:26.100
highlighting how he had used
his senate position

00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.500
to further
his private interests.

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.860
Park supporters in congress
took the unusual step

00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:36.200
of openly criticizing a
fellow member for his vendetta.

00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.700
[Thunder]

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:39.600
And in 1926,

00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.160
the voters of Arizona
refused to re-elect him.

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:45.960
Out of power,

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:50.100
Cameron could no longer protect
his Grand Canyon empire.

00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:54.100
His fraudulent mining claims
finally had to be abandoned.

00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:55.560
Indian Gardens,

00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:59.060
the dilapidated rest stop
on the trail down to the river

00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.700
where Cameron's outhouses

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:03.200
contaminated
the only fresh water,

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.660
had to be turned over
to the park.

01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:13.430
And at Bright Angel Trail, the
toll gate was finally removed

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:17.560
so that the people
who actually owned the park

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.330
could freely use it.

01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:27.600
MAN: I recall
when I was 12 years old

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.960
looking into the Grand Canyon

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.800
and being told by the ranger
on the rim

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.800
that there were rocks down there

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.030
that were nearly
2 billion years old...

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:41.030
and thinking to myself,
I'm just 12 years old.

01:00:42.130 --> 01:00:44.160
This canyon,
at least the rocks

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:47.330
if not the actual scene
that I was looking at,

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:50.630
had been there
for umpteen times longer

01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:52.800
than I had been on the planet,
had been alive,

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.500
and that humbled me.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.660
I remember thinking to myself,

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.530
we don't have very long
on this planet.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:04.400
And at the same time,
I felt a greatness,

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.860
what a privilege to be here,

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:07.860
what a privilege to be
an American

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:11.530
and to look into that canyon and
have this as an American icon

01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:14.060
and to be able
to reassure myself

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.460
that one day I would come back
and see this place again.

01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:32.860
WOMAN AS BESSIE HYDE: Some ships
sail from port to port,

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:36.300
following contentedly
the same old wind.

01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:39.860
While others who,
through restlessness,

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:44.230
watch new seas
at each break of day.

01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:48.030
We of the night will know many
things of which you sleepers

01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:50.400
have never dreamed.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.960
Bessie Hyde.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.530
COYOTE: As the sentimental
poetry she loved to write

01:01:57.530 --> 01:01:59.530
made abundantly clear,

01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:04.130
Bessie Haley Hyde yearned for
a life of romantic adventure.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:09.430
By 1928, when she was
22 years old,

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:13.130
she had already picked up
and moved half a dozen times,

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:17.300
studied art and design among
the bohemians of San Francisco,

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.730
and in the space of
less than 2 years, got married,

01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:22.960
got a quickie divorce
in Nevada,

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.960
and then got married again.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:30.060
Her new husband, Glen Hyde,
age 29,

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.300
was an Idaho potato farmer

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:35.600
with his own thirst
for doing the unusual.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.930
He had become an experienced
river runner in the northwest,

01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:42.000
having built and guided a boat

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.060
down Idaho's treacherous
Salmon River,

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:47.860
the fabled river of no return.

01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:52.530
Few of their friends
were surprised, therefore,

01:02:52.530 --> 01:02:54.200
when Glen and Bessie announced

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.660
they would celebrate
their honeymoon

01:02:56.660 --> 01:03:00.130
by attempting something
that fewer than 50 people

01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:02.260
had ever accomplished:

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:04.600
take a boat
through the Grand Canyon

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:08.100
on the turbulent
Colorado River.

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:12.760
Bessie Hyde would be
the first woman ever to try it.

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:18.630
They started out
on October 20, 1928,

01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:20.600
from Green River Utah,

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:24.360
in a 2-ton scow
Glen had built for $50

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.230
and then loaded with supplies:

01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:31.030
bags of Idaho potatoes
and home-canned vegetables,

01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:34.960
a rifle for shooting
deer and ducks along the way,

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.700
and a set of bedsprings

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:40.460
so they could sleep in comfort
on the boat.

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:43.230
Like other northwest boatmen,

01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:46.460
Glen had never worn
life preservers running rivers.

01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:49.630
and he saw no need for them
on the Colorado.

01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:58.560
After 2 weeks,

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.300
they reached the start of
the Grand Canyon a Lee's Ferry,

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:06.730
where locals advised the couple
against proceeding any farther.

01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:09.630
They considered Glen's boat
ill-suited

01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:12.600
for the huge rapids
farther downstream

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.600
and thought it folly
to be entering the big canyon

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.530
without companions
in a second boat.

01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:21.300
Glen would hear none of it.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.760
They were 2 days
ahead of schedule,

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:27.060
and the Colorado
seemed no harder to master

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:29.560
than the Salmon.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.500
WOMAN AS BESSIE HYDE:
The wind is blowing so much

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.000
that everything is just about
covered with sand,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.100
including Glen and I.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:39.330
We should be nearly
to Grand Canyon Village,

01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:42.100
but of course,
it is hard to tell.

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:47.230
The scenery is really
more majestic.

01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:48.730
[Bird screeches]

01:04:48.730 --> 01:04:52.100
We've had lots and lots
of riffles, large and small,

01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:54.830
and have been gliding along
at a great rate.

01:04:54.830 --> 01:04:58.560
We've had all kinds of camps,
from beach to rock shelves.

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:01.300
COYOTE:
Moving downstream

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:04.100
with the stone walls
towering above them,

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:06.960
they were seeing the Grand
Canyon from a perspective

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:09.930
few people had experienced:

01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:14.300
smaller side canyons
of almost unimaginable beauty

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:17.260
around every bend of the river;

01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:20.230
waterfalls
pouring out of sheer stone

01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:24.160
to feed the Colorado
as it courses by;

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.260
and always the rapids,

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:30.900
where the river's power in its
battle with anything in its way

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:33.360
was on full display.

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:41.100
Farther into the canyon,

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:44.560
the rapids got bigger
and more treacherous.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.900
Bessie, who weighed less
than 100 pounds,

01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:51.530
had already been tossed into
the water like a matchstick

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:53.560
by the big sweep oar.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:57.130
Later, Glen, too,
was knocked from the boat.

01:05:57.130 --> 01:06:02.160
Bessie somehow managed to throw
him a rope and get him back in

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.530
but was badly shaken.

01:06:04.530 --> 01:06:08.630
"I was ready to climb the canyon
wall right then and there,"

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:11.860
she wrote,
"but Glen laughed at me."

01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:17.630
At the bottom
of the Bright Angel Trail,

01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:19.300
the beached the scow

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:22.400
and hiked up to the south rim
and civilization.

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:29.200
They enjoyed a big meal
at the fancy El Tovar Hotel

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.900
and spent a cozy night
in a tent cabin

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.830
at Grand Canyon Village.

01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:38.060
The next morning,
after buying supplies

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:41.760
and arranging to have them
hauled by mule down to the boat,

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.060
the couple paid a visit

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:45.800
to Emery Kolb's
photographic studio.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:49.560
Kolb and his brother
had themselves

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:53.430
made a legendary descent
of the Colorado in 1911,

01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:56.360
compiling thrilling footage
of their journey

01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:00.700
which they showed each day
to tourists.

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:03.800
Emery took
the Hyde's photograph,

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:07.460
as he had of virtually every
tourist at the canyon rim

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:10.930
for a quarter century
and gave them a signed copy

01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:14.730
of his brother's book
about the 1911 trip.

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:18.560
Glen and Bessie's dream was
to follow the Kolbs' example,

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:21.960
make a name for themselves with
their own daring adventure,

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.330
write a best-selling book
about it,

01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:27.330
and then go on
the lecture circuit.

01:07:27.330 --> 01:07:31.100
The Hydes were certain
that they would soon be famous

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:34.560
when they ran into a reporter
from the Denver Post,

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.360
who saw the potential
in their story

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:39.400
and eagerly hung
on their every word.

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.060
"I've had the thrills
of my life," Bessie told him.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:47.730
I've been thoroughly drenched
a dozen times,

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:50.930
but I'm enjoying every minute
of the adventure.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:01.630
Others who saw the Hydes that
day told a different story,

01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:04.800
that Bessie had already
had enough of the Colorado

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.460
and was reluctant to continue
the journey.

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:10.300
When she said good-bye
to his family,

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:11.760
Emery Kolb remembered,

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.630
Bessie looked at
his daughter's shoes and said,

01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:18.160
"I wonder if I shall ever wear
pretty shoes again."

01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:21.200
At the small tourist camp

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.330
at the bottom of
the Bright Angel Trail,

01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:25.460
the Hydes signed the guestbook,

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.530
agreed to let
a wealthy vacationer

01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:29.900
ride along with them
for 1 day,

01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:33.500
and set off once more
on November 17.

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:38.060
On the 18th, they dropped
their passenger off

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.560
at a place called Hermit Camp,

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:45.230
just upstream from the 10
biggest cascades in the canyon.

01:08:45.230 --> 01:08:50.030
He asked to take their
photograph, and they complied.

01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:54.830
Then Glen and Bessie Hyde
got back in their boat...

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.160
and disappeared.

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:06.130
By mid-December,

01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:09.300
news that the honeymooners had
not been heard from in a month

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.530
was captivating the nation.

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.130
MAN: The "San Francisco
Chronicle."

01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:20.630
Mr. and Mrs. Glen Hyde,
now lost in the canyon,

01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:23.600
certainly could not have
been aware of the perils

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.660
of such a honeymoon voyage.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.660
An anxious country
watching the search

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:33.130
with hope that they
would be found and rescued

01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:35.230
also hopes that
the advertisement

01:09:35.230 --> 01:09:38.560
they have given of the desperate
character of this adventure

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.960
will deter others.

01:09:42.230 --> 01:09:44.060
COYOTE:
President Calvin Coolidge

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:46.160
finally ordered
the Army Air Corps

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.600
to aid in the search
by flying over the canyon.

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.660
And at last,
the scow was sighted.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.330
Emery and Elsworth Kolb
grabbed their cameras

01:09:57.330 --> 01:09:59.000
and hurried to the site...

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.660
which they reached
on Christmas Day.

01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:10.230
The scow was floating
in the still waters of an eddy,

01:10:10.230 --> 01:10:14.200
it's bowline caught in the rocks
30 feet underwater.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:17.630
Everything seemed untouched
on deck:

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:21.530
a baked ham, a sack of flour
and other food,

01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:24.330
hiking boots and warm clothes,

01:10:24.330 --> 01:10:26.330
the bedsprings and blankets,

01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:30.330
the Hydes' money and the book
Emery Kolb had given them,

01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:34.900
Glen's rifle, Bessie's camera
with 6 rolls of film,

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:39.000
and a small journal in which
Bessie had been keeping notes

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.660
for the book
she intended to write.

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:48.500
The last entry from November 30
simply stated,

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.260
"Ran 16 rapids today."

01:10:55.660 --> 01:11:00.060
Bessie and Glen Hyde had found
the adventure and the celebrity

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:02.100
they had been seeking.

01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:05.630
But neither of them
was ever seen again.

01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:20.030
KIRK: In a national park,

01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:23.560
you can see something that's
more stable than you are...

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.530
[Thunder]

01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:28.630
something that's more enduring
than you are.

01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:38.660
Our moment on stage is so brief,

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:43.530
but if you can be aware
of the ingredients

01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:46.560
that make up the stage
upon which you live your life,

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.100
dance your life,

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:51.330
you can enjoy the dance of life
ever so much more.

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.860
MAN AS HORACE ALBRIGHT:
If you have ever stood

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.030
and looked across
to Cascade Canyon

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:50.300
weaving its sinuous way toward
the summit of the Tetons...

01:12:52.530 --> 01:12:55.630
you will know the joy
of being in a sacred place.

01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:02.760
Designed by God
to be protected forever.

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:05.030
Horace Albright.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.260
COYOTE: Many years earlier,

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:14.860
Horace Albright and Stephen
Mather had been in Yellowstone

01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:18.630
when they took a day trip to
check on a new road being built

01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:20.760
from the park's
southern entrance

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:25.830
toward the valley just beyond,
called Jackson Hole in Wyoming.

01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:30.630
There they saw something neither
of them would ever forget,

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:34.860
a stunning series of granite
spires rising into the sky

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:37.360
from a flat sagebrush plain,

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:40.730
adorned with a necklace
of sparkling lakes

01:13:40.730 --> 01:13:42.730
and the shimmering Snake River.

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.230
It was the Tetons.

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:53.500
As far back as 1882, General
Phil Sheridan had argued

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.860
that Yellowstone Park
needed to be made even bigger

01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:59.200
to include
the natural grazing range

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:02.060
of the world's
largest surviving elk herd.

01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:06.400
The Tetons
and surrounding lowlands

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.660
were an essential part
of the Elks' migratory home,

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:12.260
and conservationists
clung to the hope

01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:15.560
for what they called
Greater Yellowstone.

01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:20.460
A small group of dude ranch
owners in Jackson Hole

01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:23.930
also worried that the valley
was becoming too developed

01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:27.700
and suggested that some
private holdings be purchased

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:30.760
and then combined
with the public lands.

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:34.400
When he became
Yellowstone's superintendent,

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:37.130
Albright made the cause his own.

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:41.360
MAN AS HORACE ALBRIGHT: This may
sound juvenile and presumptuous,

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.360
but I took it personally.

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:47.700
I really felt I had a mission
to preserve the Grand Tetons

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:51.330
in the only way I knew, through
the National Park Service.

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:55.030
COYOTE: Year after year,

01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:58.760
every dignitary Albright
escorted around Yellowstone

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.700
would eventually find himself
being led to a vantage point

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:05.760
offering a view
south of the park's borders

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.430
toward the Tetons while Albright
passionately explained

01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:13.460
the reasons why they needed
to be added to his park.

01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:16.400
Congressmen,
influential journalists,

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.500
and 2 presidents
got the treatments.

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:24.000
One day, Albright learned
that a private citizen

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.430
traveling incognito
under the name of Mr. Davison,

01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:30.360
was about to visit Yellowstone.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.700
His real identity was
John D. Rockefeller, Jr.,

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:36.730
head of one of
the richest families

01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:39.530
and greatest fortunes
in America.

01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:41.960
He had put up the money
to purchase land

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.060
on Mount Desert Island in Maine

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:47.030
and donated it
to the federal government

01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:50.200
to create Acadia National Park.

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:54.500
More recently his generosity
had established a museum

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.130
at Mesa Verde.

01:15:58.030 --> 01:16:01.060
Albright was thrilled to learn
that the great philanthropist

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:02.930
was coming to Yellowstone,

01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:07.200
but before he arrived,
Albright heard from Mather,

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:12.100
instructing him to respect
Rockefeller's privacy.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:15.530
WOMAN: He received a letter
from Stephen Mather

01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:20.300
telling him don't you dare talk
about trying to get the Tetons.

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:22.260
You are not to tell
Mr. Rockefeller

01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:23.930
anything about your dream.

01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:26.200
He always sort of added
the quotation marks.

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.530
"Your dream."

01:16:28.530 --> 01:16:30.030
So he didn't.

01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:33.530
He saw Mr. Rockefeller,
and he didn't say a word.

01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:38.260
The Rockefeller family
came back in 1926,

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:41.430
and this time Mr. Mather
either didn't care

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:46.130
or he forgot to tell him
not to talk about it.

01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:48.200
So of course he did
immediately.

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.430
He took them down there
through the valley.

01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:54.830
COYOTE: Rockefeller soon began
to see things he didn't like.

01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:56.530
MAN AS HORACE ALBRIGHT:
Why are those telephone lines

01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:57.860
on the west side of the road

01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.700
where they mar the view
of the mountains, he asked.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:03.100
Why is that
ramshackle old building

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:06.260
allowed to stand over there
where it blocks the view?

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:09.300
I explained that it was
on private land.

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:12.960
Mrs. Rockefeller seemed
increasingly upset

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.630
as we passed a woebegone-looking
old dancehall,

01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:19.700
some dilapidated cabins,
a burned-out gasoline station,

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.330
a few big billboards.

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:24.600
The Rockefellers
expressed great concern

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:27.700
that this spectacular country
was rapidly going the way

01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:29.460
of development and destruction.

01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:37.200
As the shadows lengthened, they
stopped to watch the sunset.

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:42.360
As we sat on logs, I began to
unfold my dream for the area

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:45.500
and how I had been trying
for years to save the Tetons

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:48.560
and the whole valley
north of Jackson.

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:51.830
Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller
listened.

01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:55.930
When I finished,
they remained silent

01:17:55.930 --> 01:17:59.600
as we watched the sun disappear
behind the jagged peaks,

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.500
casting long, sharp shadows
across the valley.

01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:06.100
I felt a little let down.

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:09.760
Here I had laid out
my fondest dream

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.860
and there was no word
or comment.

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.830
COYOTE:
But 4 months later,

01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:21.430
Albright was invited to
Rockefeller's New York office

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:24.230
to discuss the Tetons again.

01:18:24.230 --> 01:18:29.860
This time he showed Rockefeller
detailed maps and cost estimates

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:33.030
for a modest plan
to purchase some of the land

01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:34.800
near Jackson Lake.

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:38.960
SCHENCK: And Mr. Rockefeller
studied it quite a while,

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.200
and then he shook his head.

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.200
And he looked up and he said,
"Mr. Albright,

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.200
"this is interesting
and everything,"

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:47.030
but he said,
"this isn't what I meant.

01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:51.700
"I want to know how much it
would cost to buy that valley."

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:55.060
And my father, I heard him
so many times tell the story,

01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:59.860
and he said, "My heart
stopped beating right then...

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:02.900
"at the whole valley."

01:19:04.830 --> 01:19:07.600
COYOTE: "I remember you used
the word dream,"

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.560
Rockefeller told Albright,

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:13.330
recounting in detail the grand
panorama they had surveyed

01:19:13.330 --> 01:19:15.600
while watching the sunset.

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:18.860
"That's the area for which
I want cost estimates,"

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:20.600
Rockefeller said.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:26.060
"The family," he added, is only
interested in an ideal project."

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.560
Albright went back to work

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:33.200
and soon presented
a much grander proposal:

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:36.760
the purchase of more
than 30,000 acres

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:39.860
at a cost that would exceed
$1 million

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:43.000
and possibly much more
if word got out

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.960
that Rockefeller money
was behind the purchases

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.100
and land prices skyrocketed.

01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:52.900
Rockefeller immediately agreed
to it all,

01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:55.800
and to conceal
his participation,

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:58.430
formed the Snake River
Land Company,

01:19:58.430 --> 01:20:02.800
ostensibly a cattle business
that began buying up properties

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:05.360
through a local banker
in Jackson,

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.500
a man who not only did not know

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:09.530
the true purpose
of the purchases,

01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:14.130
but even opposed the idea
of a greater Yellowstone.

01:20:14.130 --> 01:20:16.800
When congress finally created

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:21.200
the Small Grand Teton
National Park 2 years later,

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.630
Albright and Rockefeller
were disappointed

01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:25.400
that the boundaries included

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:29.030
only the eastern front
of the mountains themselves

01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:31.630
and none of the
surrounding valley.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.300
Undeterred,

01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:39.960
Rockefeller continued
quietly buying up land,

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:44.660
giving Albright hope that his
dream might one day be realized.

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:48.960
"Rockefeller was becoming,"
Albright said,

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:53.230
"one of the best friends
the national parks ever had."

01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:08.800
MAN AS ROBERT STERLING YARD:
Already the national parks

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:11.530
are magnificently affecting
the national mind.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.530
Nowhere else do people
from all the states mingle

01:21:16.530 --> 01:21:20.530
in quite the same spirit as
they do in their national parks.

01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:26.700
One sits at dinner, say,
between a Missouri farmer

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:28.700
and an Idaho miner,

01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:31.360
and at supper between
a New York artist

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.400
and an Oregon shopkeeper.

01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:37.860
One climbs mountains
with a chance crowd

01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:40.930
from Vermont, Louisiana,
an Texas...

01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:43.360
and sits around
the evening campfire

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.200
with a California grape grower,

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.530
a locomotive engineer
from Massachusetts,

01:21:47.530 --> 01:21:49.460
and a banker from Michigan.

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:56.700
Here the social differences
so insisted on at home

01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:58.630
just don't exist.

01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:02.430
Perhaps for the first time,

01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:07.200
one realizes the common America
and loves it.

01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:16.060
In the national parks,
all are just Americans.

01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:19.900
Robert Sterling Yard.

01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:28.530
COYOTE: In 1928, yearly
visitation at the national parks

01:22:28.530 --> 01:22:31.730
topped 3 million
for the first time.

01:22:31.730 --> 01:22:35.130
"The parks," Stephen Mather
proudly proclaimed,

01:22:35.130 --> 01:22:38.900
"do not belong to one state
or to one section.

01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:41.400
They have become democratized.

01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:44.260
In many ways he was right.

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:46.460
No longer did park visitors

01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:49.100
come exclusively
from the upper classes.

01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:51.860
They now came from
the new, expanding

01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:54.800
but predominantly white
middle class.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:59.230
Americans with their own cars,
more money in their pockets

01:22:59.230 --> 01:23:01.400
and more time to spend it.

01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:04.760
Congress, too,
seemed more wiling

01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:06.700
to support the park system.

01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:11.260
It doubled and then redoubled
the annual appropriations,

01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:15.100
though the bulk of the money
was for improving roads,

01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:17.700
to accommodate
the car-driving tourists

01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:19.630
pouring into the park.

01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:28.660
Mather now embarked on an
ambitious plan in which each

01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:32.760
park was to have one major road
that would open up its scenic

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:35.760
wonders to the
motoring public.

01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:43.300
MAN: The 1920s see,
in certain national parks,

01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:48.730
some of the most mind-boggling
roads the world has ever seen

01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:51.800
because the Park Service is
willing to take a highway to

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:54.800
heights and to places that no
other sane humane being would

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:58.300
ever imagine taking a roadway.

01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:01.760
And so we see these monumental
roads providing some

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:04.460
of the most amazing driving
experiences you can find

01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:07.700
on this planet, to this day.

01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:10.230
DUNCAN: Mather wanted a road
into every park that would

01:24:10.230 --> 01:24:14.460
show off, in his mind,
the beauty of the park,

01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:17.960
and at Glacier was
the toughest place.

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.800
He went up there to personally
inspect it, and the highway

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:24.160
engineers showed him, "Well,
we'll come up this valley" or

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.360
"we'll crisscross with these--"
I don't know how many--more

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:30.130
than a dozen switchbacks
up to the pass.

01:24:30.130 --> 01:24:32.800
Fortunately, standing next to
him was Thomas Vint, who was

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.460
the landscape architect for
the National Park Service,

01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:36.960
and Mather said, "Well,
what do you think?"

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.100
And he said, "It'll look
like miners have been here,"

01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:44.830
and Mather was horrified by
the notion of it and finally

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:47.100
decided, well, we'll do
this in a different way.

01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:48.560
It'll be longer.

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:51.330
It'll be more expensive,
but it won't detract from

01:24:51.330 --> 01:24:55.200
the view, and the result was
Going to the Sun Highway,

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:58.160
which is one of the
glories of all roads

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:00.400
in the United States.

01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:12.930
COYOTE: Now, at Mather's
insistence, landscape

01:25:12.930 --> 01:25:17.330
architects--artists,
not engineers--were employed

01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:22.530
to oversee every detail of
all national park roads.

01:25:22.530 --> 01:25:25.430
CRONON: What happens is that
the parks are essentially

01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:30.400
completely converted to become
available to people in private

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:33.900
automobiles, so there are
new roadways that are carved

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:36.560
through the corridors,
there are rest stops that are

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:39.600
designed to provide framed
vistas of what you're supposed

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:44.100
to see in the parks, there are
new maps, new guide books.

01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:48.630
The parks are reinvented in
order to provide a canvas that

01:25:48.630 --> 01:25:52.400
people will witness this
nature in these parks as if

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:54.860
they were looking at a
painting through the screen

01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:56.730
of an automobile.

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:04.930
MAN AS ROBERT STERLING YARD:
So rapid is the increase

01:26:04.930 --> 01:26:07.000
of travel to the parks that it

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.300
is none too early to
anticipate the time when their

01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:15.260
popularity shall threaten
their primary purpose.

01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:17.700
While we are fighting for the
protection of the National

01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:22.930
Park System from its enemies,
we may also have to protect it

01:26:22.930 --> 01:26:25.600
from its friends.

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:28.130
Robert Sterling Yard.

01:26:28.130 --> 01:26:29.530
DUNCAN: Robert Sterling
Yard went through

01:26:29.530 --> 01:26:31.360
an incredible transformation.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.400
He started off being paid by
Stephen Mather to be the flack

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.260
for this new Park Service.

01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:40.160
Later he got sent over to a
new organization, the National

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.630
Parks Association, which
started off as under the wing

01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:44.360
of Stephen Mather.

01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:47.560
But gradually Yard started
to say, "I think Mather is

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.060
"pushing this too much.

01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:52.200
"He's going too much into
spectacle, too much into

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.760
"entertainment, too many cars."

01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:57.930
Yard wanted to have
what he called

01:26:57.930 --> 01:27:01.060
"national primeval parks."

01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:07.830
This kept them as pure as
John Muir had described them.

01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:12.600
That's where he was going--a
purist of what parks should be,

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:15.400
and eventually he became
one of the greatest critics

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:19.530
of the National Park Service.

01:27:19.530 --> 01:27:22.430
COYOTE: Yard also found
himself opposing his old

01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:26.630
friend when Kentucky's Mammoth
Cave and Virginia's Shenandoah

01:27:26.630 --> 01:27:30.400
National Park had
been set aside.

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:34.400
Mather loved having two more
parks in the east, but Yard

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:37.460
thought they did not meet
what he called "national

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:39.460
park standards."

01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:42.900
The Virginia site was too
small and lacked primitive

01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:46.300
forests, he said.

01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:49.600
And no one from the Park
Service, including Mather,

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:53.260
had ever been to Mammoth Cave.

01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:56.900
But the final straw for Robert
Sterling Yard was Mather's

01:27:56.900 --> 01:28:01.400
plans for highways
in every park.

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:05.460
Hoping to start what he called
"a new nationwide movement to

01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:08.630
preserve the primitive,"
he joined forces with the

01:28:08.630 --> 01:28:12.500
celebrated conservationist
Aldo Leopold, an idealistic

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:16.060
young forester named Bob
Marshall, and a handful

01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:19.800
of other like-minded people
to form an organization to

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:23.500
protect pristine lands,
not just from lumbermen

01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:28.660
and developers, but from the
National Park Service itself.

01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:32.400
They called it The
Wilderness Society.

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.900
RUNTE: It's very ironic that
the National Park Service,

01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:38.030
which was called upon to
preserve nature, is then seen

01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:41.800
as an impediment to its
preservation because it is not

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:45.500
as interested in wilderness as
a growing number of Americans

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:47.430
are starting to be.

01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:50.660
So the National Park Service
is accused of demeaning

01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:53.330
wilderness, of wanting to
build roads into wilderness,

01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:56.500
of wanting to make wilderness
everything a windshield

01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:01.960
experience, an overlook
experience, and many people

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:04.960
in the emerging wilderness
movement begin to become very

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:08.930
critical of the National Park
Service and of Stephen Mather.

01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:14.800
MAN: He would talk for
hours, reviewing his plans

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:17.160
for the national parks.

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:20.700
"They belong to everybody,"
he used to say.

01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:24.460
"We've got to do what we can
to see that nobody stays away

01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:27.560
"because he can't afford it."

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:30.100
"I hear lots of complaints
about the tin canners,"

01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:32.200
I told him.

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:38.060
"They dirty up the parks,
strew cans and papers all over."

01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:41.130
"What if they do?"
he would say.

01:29:41.130 --> 01:29:44.630
"They own as much of the
parks as anybody else.

01:29:44.630 --> 01:29:47.400
"We can pick up the tin cans.

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:50.660
"It's a cheap way to
make better citizens."

01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:53.230
Gilbert Stanley Underwood.

01:29:54.730 --> 01:29:57.560
COYOTE: Stephen Mather still
enjoyed nothing better than

01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:02.430
traveling from park to park in
his big touring car, wearing

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:06.330
a park ranger's uniform,
and keeping a frenetic pace

01:30:06.330 --> 01:30:08.700
that became legendary.

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:11.900
"We wore ourselves out trying
to stay with him for 16

01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:14.130
hours a day,"
one traveling companion

01:30:14.130 --> 01:30:18.930
recalled, "and then we had
to sit up half the night

01:30:18.930 --> 01:30:22.430
"listening to him
talk it over."

01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:24.900
DUNCAN: Mather could
be just a bundle

01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:28.400
of unbounded energy.

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:31.600
Albright said at times he felt
that he was the mightiest man

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:36.460
in the world, and that's how
he operated a lot of the time.

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:42.600
COYOTE: No one admired Mather
more than Horace Albright,

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:45.200
and no one in the Park Service
was more privy to

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:49.560
the director's periodic
wild mood swings.

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:52.900
At least two more times in
the 1920s, Mather was

01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:57.400
incapacitated by depression
while Albright quietly

01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:00.100
filled in.

01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:03.760
SCHENCK: They just said he
was on vacation because they

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:06.830
loved the man so much
they never wanted him hurt

01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:09.000
in any way.

01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:13.830
COYOTE: In the spring of 1927,
on his way back from

01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:17.360
inspecting Hawaii National
Park, Mather suffered a heart

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:22.530
attack, but a month later
he was in Yosemite, where he

01:31:22.530 --> 01:31:25.760
hiked to Glacier Point to
prove to his doctor that he

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:29.000
was back at full strength
and capable of resuming his

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.560
busy schedule.

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:34.830
He went to Mt. Rainier to
go over plans for a new road

01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:38.830
in the park and attended the
opening of a majestic lodge

01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:42.060
on the north rim of
the Grand Canyon.

01:31:44.230 --> 01:31:45.960
At Zion,
he showed up to check

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:49.800
on the progress of a mile-long
tunnel being blasted through

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.830
the sandstone.

01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:54.760
It was considered an
engineering marvel, and Mather

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:59.000
became so excited about it he
stayed for several more days

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:05.600
so he could become the first
person to walk through it.

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:10.760
On July 4, 1928, he celebrated
his 61st birthday in his

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:15.260
favorite park, Yosemite,
and took a long horseback ride

01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:18.360
up out of the valley to
the Towalame Meadows

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:20.560
in the high country.

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:23.460
He had persuaded some
newspapers to report

01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:27.330
on the logging being done on
a grove of giant sugar pines

01:32:27.330 --> 01:32:30.700
located on a privately owned
parcel within the park

01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:35.130
boundaries and was pleased to
learn that their stories had

01:32:35.130 --> 01:32:40.630
prompted John D. Rockefeller
Jr. to put up $1.7 million to

01:32:40.630 --> 01:32:44.660
help buy the land, make it
part of Yosemite, and protect

01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:47.300
the trees forever.

01:32:52.230 --> 01:32:59.230
Then, on November 5, 1928,
he suffered a serious stroke.

01:32:59.230 --> 01:33:02.460
Albright rushed to his side.

01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:04.200
MAN AS HORACE ALBRIGHT: He had
been trying to say something

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:07.660
but could not
make himself understood.

01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:12.200
The only word they had been
able to get was "cascades."

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:13.700
"Cascades in Yosemite?"

01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:17.500
I asked,
but that was not it.

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:19.760
Cascade Corner in Yellowstone?

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.860
But that was not it either.

01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:25.060
Cascade Mountains
in Washington?

01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:28.000
His eyes crinkled in a smile.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.660
That was it.

01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:32.860
He wanted to know about
the new highway across

01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:36.130
the northeastern corner of
Mt. Rainier that the state

01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:40.930
of Washington was
planning to name after him.

01:33:40.930 --> 01:33:44.760
I told him that signs were
now going up along the highway

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:48.800
designating it Mather Parkway.

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:53.260
A relaxed, satisfied
look came over his face.

01:33:56.430 --> 01:34:00.630
COYOTE: On January 22,
1930, after more than a year

01:34:00.630 --> 01:34:04.800
of incapacitation,
Stephen Mather died.

01:34:06.630 --> 01:34:10.500
In his memory, a mountain just
east of Mt. McKinley would

01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:13.560
be named Mt. Mather.

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:16.430
An overlook at the Grand
Canyon would be called

01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:19.460
Mather Point.

01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:22.630
A scenic stretch of the
Potomac River would be named

01:34:22.630 --> 01:34:25.630
Mather Gorge.

01:34:25.630 --> 01:34:29.160
A nationwide tree-planting
campaign in his honor would

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:35.130
also result in Mather
Forest near Lake George.

01:34:35.130 --> 01:34:39.360
And in every national park,
the agency he had created

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:43.130
and molded to his vision would
erect a bronze plaque with his

01:34:43.130 --> 01:34:48.700
likeness and these words:
"There will never come an end

01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:51.830
"to the good that he has done."

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:02.300
MAN AS HORACE KEPHART:
George Masa and I

01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:03.800
put in a lot of work on the park

01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:09.230
area--George especially,
for while I only interviewed

01:35:09.230 --> 01:35:13.630
old residents throughout the
territory, he labored long

01:35:13.630 --> 01:35:17.660
and earnestly on his maps.

01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:21.730
It is astonishing that a Jap,
not even naturalized, so far

01:35:21.730 --> 01:35:25.230
as I know, should have
done all this exploring

01:35:25.230 --> 01:35:29.300
and photographing and mapping
without compensation

01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:33.530
but at much expense to himself
out of sheer loyalty to

01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:35.900
the park idea.

01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:38.960
He deserves a monument.

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:42.230
Horace Kephart.

01:35:42.230 --> 01:35:44.700
COYOTE: Horace Kephart and
his friend George Masa had

01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:48.530
already devoted years of their
lives trying to get the Smoky

01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:51.430
Mountains set aside
as America's newest

01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:54.330
national park.

01:35:54.330 --> 01:35:57.760
The $5 million pledged by the
people of Tennessee and North

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:02.600
Carolina was only half of
the $10 million price tag

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:05.000
for the land.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.530
Park boosters had been
desperately looking for other

01:36:07.530 --> 01:36:11.500
possible sources to make
up the difference.

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:16.830
The search ended once again
with John D. Rockefeller Jr.

01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:22.460
After being shown some of
Masa's photographs and told

01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:25.300
about the impending
destruction of the old-growth

01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:31.360
forests, Rockefeller at
first pledged $1.5 million.

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:35.730
Then he reconsidered and
offered the entire $5 million

01:36:35.730 --> 01:36:40.230
that was still needed, from
a fund named for his mother.

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:47.560
But the timber companies
had not given up the fight.

01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:52.000
As owners of 85% of the
land in the proposed park,

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.200
they held out for exorbitant
prices and kept cutting trees,

01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:00.430
sometimes even after
signing agreements to

01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:03.330
transfer ownership.

01:37:03.330 --> 01:37:07.760
"Boys, we sold it," one company
supervisor told his employees.

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:09.700
"Log her."

01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:12.400
"When we got done with that
poor little ridge," a worker

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:17.860
remembered, "there wasn't
a toothpick left on it."

01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:22.930
Finally, the cutting stopped
and the lumbermen left.

01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:31.400
More than 5,500 people, mostly
whites and Cherokees, lived

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:35.600
within the borders of
the proposed park.

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:40.800
They, too, would have to
leave, willingly or not.

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:43.460
Some happily sold their land.

01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:48.160
Others refused, fought and
lost in court, and eventually

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:52.960
had to sell under
condemnation proceedings.

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:56.430
Many were offered leases for
up to two years as the park

01:37:56.430 --> 01:38:02.360
took shape, becoming tenants
on the land they had once owned.

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:05.900
As the isolated cabins and
their small communities--

01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:09.860
Webb's Creek, Ravensford
and Smokemont, Cataloochee

01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:13.900
and Cades Cove--emptied
one by one,

01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:17.500
Horace Albright, now in charge
of the Park Service, assured

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:20.960
the people that they would
always be allowed to maintain

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:25.630
the cemeteries near their
now-vacant churches.

01:38:25.630 --> 01:38:28.830
It provided small comfort
against the bitterness

01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:30.500
of removal.

01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:33.500
Their hearts were broken,
one resident remembered,

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:36.830
and most of them left crying.

01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:44.700
CRONON: I think the paradox
of local resistance to the

01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:48.930
creation of national parks
is a deep, deep paradox

01:38:48.930 --> 01:38:53.630
in American ideas of democracy
because on the one hand,

01:38:53.630 --> 01:38:57.230
one of our visions is that
people in a local place are

01:38:57.230 --> 01:38:59.760
the ones who best understand
that place, are the ones who

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:02.400
have its interests most
at heart, and who really,

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:05.030
ideally, ought to be the ones
who vote about what should

01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:08.660
happen to that land, just
as on a local school board.

01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:12.230
And yet it is also true that
these national parks are not

01:39:12.230 --> 01:39:14.760
in the local place
that they are in.

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.360
They are in the nation.

01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:21.230
They stand for the nation,
and so by that understanding,

01:39:21.230 --> 01:39:23.430
the democratic institutions
that should defend them are

01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:26.260
not at the local level but
at the level of the nation,

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:28.530
and this tension between
federal control of our

01:39:28.530 --> 01:39:32.660
democracy and local control
of our democracy is hard-wired

01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:37.960
into what we
think democracy is.

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:39.830
MAN AS HORACE KEPHART:
The long and difficult task

01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:43.560
of surveying the Smoky
Mountains national parklands

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:45.730
is finished.

01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:49.300
It was a big undertaking and
beset with discouragements

01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:54.860
of all sorts, but we've won.

01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:59.630
Within two years, we will have
good roads into the Smokies,

01:39:59.630 --> 01:40:03.960
and then--well,
then I'll get out.

01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:09.330
This will probably ruin
the old country for me.

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:15.800
COYOTE: Horace Kephart
never left the Smokies.

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:23.000
On April 2, 1931, he was
killed in a car crash

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.200
on a mountain road.

01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:32.730
George Masa, the first to
arrive and last to leave

01:40:32.730 --> 01:40:37.300
Kephart's funeral, served
as pallbearer and took

01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:40.330
a photograph of the
memorial service at his

01:40:40.330 --> 01:40:43.930
friend's gravesite.

01:40:43.930 --> 01:40:46.000
MAN AS MASA: I don't know
what I say about the death

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.230
of our Kephart.

01:40:48.230 --> 01:40:50.630
It shocked me to pieces.

01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:57.900
When I am on trail, I
always cry in my heart.

01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:00.500
Wish Kep with me.

01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:04.660
I have a walking cane which
Kep carried with him, so when

01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:07.960
I go to Smokies,
I carry his cane.

01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:10.660
I call it Kep.

01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:15.830
I miss him so much
because he was my buddy.

01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:22.330
COYOTE: In 1933, after
organizing a hike to

01:41:22.330 --> 01:41:24.900
commemorate the second
anniversary of Kephart's

01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:29.400
death, George
Masa became sick.

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:32.160
With no money for his
own doctor, he ended up

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:37.930
in the county hospital,
where he died on June 21,

01:41:37.930 --> 01:41:42.000
penniless and with no
known relatives to notify.

01:41:46.230 --> 01:41:50.500
His hiking club put together
a funeral service in Asheville

01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:54.200
but did not have the money to
bury him next to Kephart as

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:56.800
had been his wish.

01:42:04.230 --> 01:42:09.030
By then, the nation itself had
fallen on hard times.

01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:12.000
The Great Depression was
devastating the country,

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.360
and the people of Tennessee
and North Carolina, despite

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:18.730
their best intentions,
were unable to fulfill many

01:42:18.730 --> 01:42:24.400
of the pledges they had
made to create the park.

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:27.100
But now there was a new
president, the cousin

01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:30.960
of Theodore Roosevelt, who
had his own ambitious plans

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:32.960
for the national parks.

01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:35.830
Inspired by all the pennies
and nickels that had been

01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:39.160
collected from everyday
people, Franklin Delano

01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:42.560
Roosevelt decided
to intervene.

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:45.800
To make up the shortfall,
the president allocated

01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:50.960
$1.5 million in scarce federal
funds to complete the land

01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:55.030
purchases, the first time in
history that the United States

01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:58.600
government had spent its
own money to buy land

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:00.960
for a national park.

01:43:03.630 --> 01:43:07.860
Within that park, on the main
divide of the Smoky Mountains

01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:11.600
that had offered them so much
solace and for which they,

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:18.300
in turn, devoted so much of
their lives, is a 6,217-foot

01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:21.600
peak that now bears
the official name

01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:23.830
of Mt. Kephart.

01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:28.130
And on its broad shoulder is
another, somewhat shorter peak

01:43:28.130 --> 01:43:33.300
now called Masa Knob.

01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:35.860
[Birds chirping]

01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:45.230
WOMAN AS MARGART KEPHART:
May 28, 1929.

01:43:45.230 --> 01:43:47.260
The Grand Canyon.

01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:55.500
We arrived this morning
after a pleasant run through

01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:59.630
national forest
over paved highway.

01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:05.030
We made camp and had dinner
before we set out to look

01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:06.830
at the canyon.

01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:17.500
There it was--beautiful,
majestic, sublime.

01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:23.260
But somehow I missed the thrill
of that first look 14 years ago.

01:44:24.430 --> 01:44:28.100
Great moments in our
lives do not return.

01:44:31.730 --> 01:44:34.330
COYOTE: Among the millions of
Americans who had felt Stephen

01:44:34.330 --> 01:44:37.830
Mather's impact on the
national parks were Margaret

01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:40.530
and Edward Gehrke.

01:44:40.530 --> 01:44:43.400
In 1915,
when they had first visited

01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:46.930
the Grand Canyon, Mather was
just beginning his crusade to

01:44:46.930 --> 01:44:50.560
promote and develop the parks,
and the number of park

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:55.960
visitors nationwide
was just over 300,000.

01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:59.530
By 1929, when the Gehrkes
reached the Grand Canyon

01:44:59.530 --> 01:45:04.300
a second time, that number
would be 10 times bigger--

01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:10.760
3,250,000 visitors to a
well-publicized string of parks

01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:14.800
and monuments stretching
from Maine to California,

01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:17.260
from Hawaii to Alaska.

01:45:19.330 --> 01:45:24.400
By then, the Gehrkes had
already been to 12 of the 21

01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:29.200
existing parks, some of
them more than once.

01:45:31.630 --> 01:45:35.100
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE:
May 29. For us, the canyon needs

01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:37.330
an added experience.

01:45:37.330 --> 01:45:40.730
We decided to hike to the
bottom, stay overnight,

01:45:40.730 --> 01:45:44.330
and return tomorrow.

01:45:44.330 --> 01:45:51.460
May 30. Well, it was a great
hike--7 miles to the bottom

01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:55.030
and 107 to the top.

01:45:57.530 --> 01:46:02.060
We are stiff and
lame but satisfied.

01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:06.030
What is life but
to dream and do?

01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:13.830
COYOTE: Traveling in the new
Buick they called Red Peter

01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:17.730
with a new dog named Pride as
their companion, the Gehrkes

01:46:17.730 --> 01:46:22.930
kept on the move, intent
on adding more parks to

01:46:22.930 --> 01:46:24.900
their list.

01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:33.560
On June 9, they reached
Sequoia National Park...

01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:36.530
on the 10th, General Grant...

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:41.200
and on June 11, they entered

01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:45.160
John Muir's Yosemite
for the first time.

01:46:48.330 --> 01:46:51.430
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE:
Yosemite, the incomparable

01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:54.260
Yosemite of our dreams.

01:46:55.930 --> 01:46:58.360
Edward tried so hard to
capture it all with his

01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:02.900
camera, while I wondered a
bit if I could ever get it all

01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:05.330
down in my diary.

01:47:09.330 --> 01:47:13.530
In these few days, Yosemite
Valley must in some sense

01:47:13.530 --> 01:47:20.360
become ours, and we will feel
in part what John Muir felt.

01:47:23.730 --> 01:47:26.960
COYOTE: Soon they were
on the move again.

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:31.000
Back in 1921, impassible
roads had prevented them from

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.200
reaching Lassen
Volcanic National Park

01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:37.000
in northern California.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.900
Not this time.

01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:48.400
9 days later, they were
in Zion in southern Utah.

01:47:50.900 --> 01:47:54.000
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE:
June 28. We arrived at Bryce

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.930
Canyon this morning.

01:47:56.930 --> 01:47:59.230
A gorgeous spectacle.

01:47:59.230 --> 01:48:03.130
Fantasy and startling beauty.

01:48:03.130 --> 01:48:07.860
The silent city with towers
and fortresses and steeples

01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:11.300
and afar, a thousand windows.

01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:17.430
COYOTE: The Gehrkes had
now been to all but one

01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:21.860
of the national parks in
the lower 48 at that time.

01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:31.900
5 years later, in the summer
of 1934, they made their

01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:37.360
fourth visit to Rocky Mountain
National Park, a place now

01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:39.600
filled with memories
stretching back to

01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:42.730
the couple's earliest
trips together.

01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:51.260
They had a different dog
with them now, and a new car,

01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:55.030
one in which Edward had
installed a radio to listen to

01:48:55.030 --> 01:49:00.800
while the miles rolled
beneath their wheels.

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:03.030
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE: So
much new pavement has changed

01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:06.230
the appearance of the country.

01:49:06.230 --> 01:49:08.800
We see the mountains.

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:11.900
Before you could say Jack
Robinson, we were lugging

01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:16.400
things up the steep steps into
the little cabin called

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:22.800
Rose-Den we have loved
so many years.

01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:26.430
The old familiar mountainside
with its cabins, the snowy

01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:32.530
peaks beyond, the rush
of water all the same.

01:49:32.530 --> 01:49:36.530
Only I am different.

01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:42.630
COYOTE: Margaret and Edward
were both in their 50s now,

01:49:42.630 --> 01:49:46.660
and on this visit, they tended
to do more driving than hiking

01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:50.060
from place to
place in the park.

01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:54.730
Margaret noted more litter on
the roadside than ever before.

01:49:54.730 --> 01:49:58.230
Edward fished as always.

01:50:00.630 --> 01:50:03.760
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE:
Sunday at Rose-Den.

01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:07.000
The twilight hour is here.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.800
I look out to dark clouds
on the mountainsides.

01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:14.330
Towards evening, we have
gotten our things together

01:50:14.330 --> 01:50:18.060
for quick packing
in the morning.

01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:22.700
Our stay here in Rose
Den comes to an end.

01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:25.860
Will we come back again?

01:50:25.860 --> 01:50:27.630
I wonder.

01:50:29.730 --> 01:50:31.100
[Hammering]

01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:34.230
COYOTE: In the mid-1930s,
Edward would build them

01:50:34.230 --> 01:50:39.400
a house-car, and they would
take it on some trial runs to

01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:43.200
the Minnesota lakes.

01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:46.130
But before they could embark
with it on another extended

01:50:46.130 --> 01:50:53.260
tour of national parks,
he took ill in 1939 and died.

01:50:57.660 --> 01:51:00.700
Margaret would accept a job
working for the University

01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:04.900
of Nebraska and no longer
spend her winters dreaming

01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:09.160
of new adventures or her
summers pursuing them.

01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:17.160
But in 1948, at age 65,
she would return to Rocky

01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:22.160
Mountain National
Park and Rose-Den.

01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:23.900
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE:
I took a 5-mile walk to the

01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:28.330
village of Estes and back.

01:51:28.330 --> 01:51:33.900
Found tourists everywhere,
buying things and things.

01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:36.200
But the walk was good.

01:51:41.130 --> 01:51:45.630
This evening, a great storm
raged on Longs Peak, and when

01:51:45.630 --> 01:51:50.330
I beheld this majesty, I felt
equal to the contemplations

01:51:50.330 --> 01:51:53.860
of divinity.

01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:59.460
Perhaps the walk
cleared my vision.

01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:03.230
COYOTE: On this trip, without
Edward to do the driving,

01:52:03.230 --> 01:52:06.860
Margaret went out and back the
way the couple had traveled

01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:11.630
together so many years
earlier--by train.

01:52:11.630 --> 01:52:14.560
WOMAN AS MARGARET GEHRKE:
July 13, 5 P.M.

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:17.860
En route the Zephyr.

01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:23.400
Here I am this mid-July
afternoon going home, and glad

01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:25.860
to be going home.

01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:28.430
Surely I care
little about home.

01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:31.060
I never have.

01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:35.460
Back to Nebraska to the
hateful heat of summer to work

01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:42.860
day after day, to monotony,
most would say, but glad.

01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:46.330
This long, silver train
makes swift passage.

01:52:46.330 --> 01:52:50.130
It is streaking across the
flat Colorado country as I sit

01:52:50.130 --> 01:52:54.230
here, alone.

01:52:54.230 --> 01:52:59.360
Why should I be
so near to tears?

01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:04.360
The whole trip to
Colorado like a dream now.

01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:09.560
The whole thing drops from my
shoulders now like a jeweled

01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:16.000
coat, and I lay it aside,

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.400
feeling I've never
worn it at all.

01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:21.330
Margaret Gehrke.
