2
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.330
I'll heat his blood withGreekish wine to-night,

3
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.570
Which with my scimitarI'll cool to-morrow.

4
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.800
Patroclus, let us feasthim to the height.

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.400
Here comes Thersites.

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.730
How now, thou core ofenvy!

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.570
Thou crusty batch ofnature, what's the news?

8
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.770
Why, thou picture ofwhat thou seemest,

9
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.830
and idol of idiot worshippers,here's a letter for thee.

10
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.100
From whence, fragment?

11
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.730
Why, thou full dish offool, from Troy.

12
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.430
Well said, adversity!

13
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.270
Prithee, be silent, boy; Iprofit not by thy talk:

14
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.500
thou art thought to beAchilles' male varlet.

15
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.670
Male varlet, you rogue!what's that?

16
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.370
Why, his masculine whore.Now, the rotten diseases

17
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.230
of the south, the guts-griping,ruptures, catarrhs,

18
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.570
loads o' gravel i' the back,cold palsies, raw eyes,

19
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.900
dirt-rotten livers,wheezing lungs, sciaticas,

20
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.600
incurable bone-ache,

21
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.730
take and take again suchpreposterous discoveries!

22
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.170
Why thou damnablebox of envy, thou,

23
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.900
what meanest thouto curse thus?

24
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.230
Do I curse thee?

25
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.870
Why no, you ruinous butt,you whoreson

26
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.670
indistinguishable cur, no.

27
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.130
No! why art thou thenexasperate, thou idle

28
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.430
immaterial skein of sleave-silk,

29
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.570
thou tassel of a prodigal'spurse, thou?

30
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.630
Ah, how the poorworld is pestered

31
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.070
with such waterflies,diminutives of nature!

32
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.430
Out, gall!

33
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.300
Finch-egg!

34
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.900
My sweet Patroclus, I amthwarted quite

35
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.270
From my great purpose into-morrow's battle.

36
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.430
Here is a letter fromQueen Hecuba,

37
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.230
A token from her daughter,my fair love,

38
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.730
Both taxing me and gagingme to keep

39
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.070
An oath that I have sworn.I will not break it:

40
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.870
Fall Greeks; fail fame;honour or go or stay;

41
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.200
My major vow lies here,this I'll obey.

42
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.770
Come, come, Thersites,help to trim my tent:

43
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.500
This night in banquetingmust all be spent.

44
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.500
Away, Patroclus!

45
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.100
With too much bloodand too little brain,

46
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.000
these two may run mad; but,if with too much brain

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.700
and too little blood they do,I'll be a curer of madmen.

48
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.930
Here's Agamemnon,

49
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.200
an honest fellow enough andone that loves quails;

50
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.530
but he has not so muchbrain as earwax:

51
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.430
O, his brother, thebull,--the primitive statue,

52
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.270
and oblique memorialof cuckolds;

53
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.500
To be a dog, a mule, a cat, afitchew, a toad, a lizard,

54
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.000
an owl, or aherring without a roe,

55
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.500
I would not care;but to be Menelaus,

56
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.600
I would conspireagainst destiny.

57
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.830
Hey-day! spiritsand fires!

58
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.270
Oh yes. Oh yes.

59
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.730
We go wrong, we go wrong.

60
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.670
No, yonder 'tis;

61
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.870
There, where we see thelights.

62
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.570
I trouble you.

63
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.130
No, not a whit.

64
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.670
Here comes himself toguide you.

65
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.300
Welcome, brave Hector;welcome, princes all.

66
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.700
So now, fair prince ofTroy, I bid good night.

67
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.070
Ajax commands the guard totend on you.

68
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.730
Thanks and good night tothe Greeks' general.

69
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.170
Good night, my lord.

70
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.870
Good night, sweet lordMenelaus.

71
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.830
Good night and welcome,both at once,

72
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.430
to those That go or tarry.

73
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.330
Old Nestor tarries; andyou too, Diomed,

74
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.070
Keep Hector company anhour or two.

75
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.930
I cannot, lord; I haveimportant business,

76
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.730
The tide whereof is now.Good night, great Hector.

77
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.800
Give me your hand.

78
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.870
Sir. Goodnight.

79
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.200
Come. Into my tent.

80
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.300
Follow his torch; hegoes to Calchas' tent:

81
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.200
I'll keep you company.

82
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.470
Sweet sir, you honour me.

83
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.800
That same Diomed's afalse-hearted rogue,

84
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.570
a most unjust knave;

85
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.500
I will no more trusthim when he leers

86
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.570
than I will a serpentwhen he hisses:

87
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.600
they say he keeps a Trojandrab,

88
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.030
and uses the traitorCalchas' tent:

89
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.600
I'll after. Nothing but lechery!all incontinent varlets!

90
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.930
What, are you up here, ho?speak.

91
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.170
Who calls?

92
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.400
Diomed. Where'syour daughter?

93
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.970
She comes to you.

94
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.870
How now, my charge!

Now, my sweet guardian!Hark, a word with you.

96
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.030
Yea, so familiar!

97
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.300
She will sing any man atfirst sight.

98
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.630
Will you remember?

99
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.330

100
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.130
Nay, but do, then;

101
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.000
And let your mind becoupled with your words.

102
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.370
What should she remember?

103
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.930
List.

104
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.870
Sweet honey Greek, temptme no more to folly.

105
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.070
Roguery!

106
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.000
Nay, then,--

107
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I'll tell you what,--

108
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.530
Foh, foh! come, tell apin: you are forsworn.

109
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.930
In faith, I cannot: whatwould you have me do?

110
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.030
A juggling trick,--to besecretly open.

111
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.730
What did you swear youwould bestow on me?

112
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.000
I prithee, do not hold meto mine oath;

113
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.830
Bid me do any thing butthat, sweet Greek.

114
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.300
Good night.

115
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.170
Diomed,--

116
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.730
No, no, good night: I'llbe your fool no more.

117
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.300
Thy better must.

118
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.900
Hark, one word in yourear.

119
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.170
O plague and madness!

120
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.770
You are moved, prince; letus depart, I pray you,

121
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.300
Lest your displeasureshould enlarge itself

122
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.500
To wrathful terms: thisplace is dangerous;

123
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.200
I beseech you, go.

124
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.370
Behold, I pray you!

Nay, good my lord, go off:

You flow to greatdistraction; come, my lord.

127
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.100
I pray thee, stay.

128
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.470
You have not patience;come.

129
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.870
I pray you, stay; by helland all hell's torments

130
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.500
I will not speak a word!

131
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.770
And so, good night.

132
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.870
Nay, but you part inanger.

133
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.270
Doth that grieve thee?

134
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.500
O wither'd truth!

135
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.200
Why, how now, Trojan!

136
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.200
By Jove, I willbe patient.

137
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.570
Guardian!--why, Greek!

138
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.070
Foh, foh! adieu; youpalter.

139
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.530
In faith, I do not: comehither once again.

140
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.230
She strokes his cheek!

141
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.470
Come, come.

142
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.400
Nay, stay; by Jove, I willnot speak a word:

143
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.830
There is between my willand all offences

144
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.400
A guard of patience: staya little while.

145
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.970
How the devil Luxury, with hisfat rump and potato-finger,

146
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.930
tickles these together!Fry, lechery, fry!

147
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.630
But will you, then?

148
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.670
In faith, I will, la;never trust me else.

149
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:27.300
Give me some token for thesurety of it.

150
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:33.400
I'll fetch you one.

151
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.130
You have sworn patience.

152
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.870
Fear me not, sweet lord;

153
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.100
I will not be myself, norhave cognition

154
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.270
Of what I feel: I am allpatience.

155
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.530
Here, Diomed, keep thissleeve.

156
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.600
O beauty! where is thyfaith?

157
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.470
My lord,--

158
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.870
I will be patient;outwardly I will.

159
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:55.130
You look upon that sleeve;behold it well.

160
00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:01.300
He loved me--O falsewench!--Give't me again.

161
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.770
Whose was't?

162
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.300
It is no matter, now Ihave't again.

163
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.300
I will not meet with youto-morrow night:

164
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.330
I prithee, Diomed, visitme no more.

165
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:19.930
Now she sharpens: wellsaid, whetstone!

166
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:20.730
I shall have it.

167
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.570
What, this?

168
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.100
Ay, that.

169
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:32.330
O, all you gods! O pretty,pretty pledge!

170
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.630
Thy master now liesthinking in his bed

171
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:42.400
Of thee and me, and sighs,and takes my glove,

172
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.800
And gives memorial daintykisses to it,

173
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.400
As I kiss thee. Nay, donot snatch it from me;

174
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.330
He that takes that dothtake my heart withal.

175
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.100
I had your heart before,this follows it.

176
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.200
I did swear patience.

177
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.530
You shall not have it,Diomed; faith, you shall not;

178
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:00.800
I'll give you somethingelse.

179
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.930
I will have this: whosewas it?

180
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:02.770
It is no matter.

181
00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.230
Come, tell me whose itwas.

182
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.030
'Twas one's that loved mebetter than you will.

183
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.570
But, now you have it,take it.

184
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.470
Whose was it?

185
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.730
By all Diana'swaiting-women yond,

186
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.530
And by herself, I will nottell you whose.

187
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.770
To-morrow will I wear iton my helm,

188
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.070
And grieve his spirit thatdares not challenge it.

189
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:20.730
Wert thou the devil, andworest it on thy horn,

190
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.300
It should be challenged.

191
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:37.900
Well, well, 'tis done, 'tispast: and yet it is not;

192
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.030
I will not keep my word.

193
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.270
Why, then, farewell;

194
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.870
Thou never shalt mockDiomed again.

195
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.100
You shall not go: onecannot speak a word,

196
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.330
But it straight startsyou.

197
00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:59.130
I do not like thisfooling.

198
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:05.270
What, shall I come? thehour?

199
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:17.300
Ay, come:--O Jove!--docome:--I shall be plagued.

200
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.830
Farewell till then.

201
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:29.930
Good night: I prithee,come.

202
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.770
But with my heart theother eye doth see.

203
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:05.330
Ah, poor our sex! thisfault in us I find,

204
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.930
The error of our eyedirects our mind:

205
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:13.170
What error leads must err;

206
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:24.030
O, then conclude Minds sway'dby eyes are full of turpitude.

207
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.270
All's done, my lord.

208
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.970
It is.

209
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:15.200
Why stay we, then?

210
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:21.000
To make a recordation tomy soul

211
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:30.100
Of every syllable thathere was spoke.

212
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.430
But if I tell how thesetwo did co-act,

213
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:42.400
Shall I not lie inpublishing a truth?

214
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.330
Sith yet there is acredence in my heart,

215
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.470
An esperance soobstinately strong,

216
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:52.570
That doth invert theattest of eyes and ears,

217
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.070
As if those organs haddeceptious functions,

218
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:59.700
Created only tocalumniate.

219
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.470
Was Cressid here?

220
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.570
I cannot conjure, Trojan.

221
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.130
She was not, sure.

222
00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:11.100
Most sure she was.

223
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.100
Why, my negation hath notaste of madness.

224
00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.570
Nor mine, my lord: Cressidwas here but now.

225
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:23.030
Let it not be believed forwomanhood!

226
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:30.270
Think, we had mothers; donot give advantage

227
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.030
To stubborn critics, apt,without a theme,

228
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.530
For depravation, to squarethe general sex

229
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:40.830
By Cressid's rule: ratherthink this not Cressid.

230
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:47.330
What hath she done, prince,that can soil our mothers?

231
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:55.270
Nothing at all, unlessthat this were she.

232
00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:08.330
This she? no, this isDiomed's Cressida:

233
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:15.100
If beauty have a soul,this is not she;

234
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.130
If souls guide vows, ifvows be sanctimonies,

235
00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.300
If sanctimony be the gods'delight,

236
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.500
If there be rule in unityitself,

237
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:34.230
This is not she. O madnessof discourse,

238
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:40.900
That cause sets up withand against itself!

239
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:45.700
Bi-fold authority! wherereason can revolt

240
00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.370
Without perdition, andloss assume all reason

241
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:56.930
Without revolt: this is,and is not, Cressid.

242
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.730
Within my soul there dothconduce a fight

243
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:03.130
Of this strange naturethat a thing inseparate

244
00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:07.030
Divides more wider thanthe sky and earth,

245
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.970
And yet the spaciousbreadth of this division

246
00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:13.070
Admits no orifex for apoint as subtle

247
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:18.430
As Ariachne's broken woofto enter.

248
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:22.270
Instance, O instance!strong as Pluto's gates;

249
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:26.800
Cressid is mine, tied withthe bonds of heaven:

250
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:32.130
Instance, O instance!strong as heaven itself;

251
00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.800
The bonds of heaven areslipp'd, dissolved, and loosed;

252
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.000
And with another knot,five-finger-tied,

253
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.070
The fractions of herfaith, orts of her love,

254
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.730
The fragments, scraps, thebits and greasy relics

255
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.800
Of her o'er-eaten faith,are bound to Diomed.

256
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.070
May worthy Troilus be halfattach'd

257
00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.600
With that which here hispassion doth express?

258
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.130
Ay, Greek; and that shallbe divulged well

259
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.100
In characters as red asMars his heart

260
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.130
Inflamed with Venus: neverdid young man fancy

261
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.800
With so eternal and sofix'd a soul.

262
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:03.870
Hark, Greek: as much as Ido Cressid love,

263
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:07.930
So much by weight hate Iher Diomed:

264
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:12.200
That sleeve is mine thathe'll bear on his helm;

265
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.900
Were it a casque composedby Vulcan's skill,

266
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.530
My sword should bite it:not the dreadful spout

267
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.270
Which shipmen do thehurricano call,

268
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.400
Constringed in mass by thealmighty sun,

269
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.030
Shall dizzy with moreclamour Neptune's ear

270
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.330
In his descent than shallmy prompted sword

271
00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.400
Falling on Diomed.

272
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:32.830
O Cressid! O false Cressid!false, false, false!

273
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.630
Let all untruths stand bythy stained name,

274
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.700
And they'll seem glorious.

275
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.770
O, contain yourself

276
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:40.800
Your passion draws earshither.

277
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.370
I have been seeking youthis hour, my lord:

278
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:48.300
Hector, by this, is arminghim in Troy;

279
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:54.930
Ajax, your guard, stays toconduct you home.

280
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:09.670
Have with you, prince. Mycourteous lord, adieu.

281
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:20.970
Farewell, revolted fair!and, Diomed,

282
00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:28.700
Stand fast, and wear acastle on thy head!

283
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.670
I'll bring you to thegates.

284
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.830
Accept distracted thanks.

285
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.830
When was my lord so muchungently temper'd,

286
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:54.270
To stop his ears againstadmonishment?

287
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:58.400
Unarm, unarm, and do notfight to-day.

288
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.570
You train me to offendyou; get you in:

289
00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.400
By all the everlastinggods, I'll go!

290
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.730
My dreams will, sure,prove ominous to the day.

291
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.700
No more, I say.

292
00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.200
Where is my brotherHector?

293
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.670
Here, sister; arm'd, andbloody in intent.

294
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.730
Consort with me in loudand dear petition,

295
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.130
Pursue we him on knees;for I have dream'd

296
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.070
Of bloody turbulence, andthis whole night

297
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.870
Hath nothing been but shapesand forms of slaughter.

298
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.030
O, 'tis true.

299
00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.370
Ho! bid my trumpet sound!

300
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.930
No notes of sally, for theheavens, sweet brother.

301
00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.170
Be gone, I say: the godshave heard me swear.

302
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.270
The gods are deaf to hotand peevish vows:

303
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.170
They are pollutedofferings, more abhorr'd

304
00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.130
Than spotted livers in thesacrifice.

305
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.500
O, be persuaded! do notcount it holy

306
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:45.470
To hurt by being just: itis as lawful,

307
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:48.630
For we would give much, touse violent thefts,

308
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.600
And rob in the behalf ofcharity.

309
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.300
It is the purpose thatmakes strong the vow;

310
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.730
But vows to every purposemust not hold:

311
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:56.900
Unarm, sweet Hector.

312
00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.030
Hold you still, I say;

313
00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:02.200
Mine honour keeps theweather of my fate:

314
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.130
Life every man holds dear;but the dear man

315
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:09.670
Holds honour far moreprecious-dear than life.

316
00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.230
How now, young man! mean'stthou to fight to-day?

317
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.270
Cassandra, call my fatherto persuade.

318
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.670
No, faith, young Troilus;doff thy harness, youth;

319
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.300
I am to-day i' the vein ofchivalry:

320
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.430
Let grow thy sinews tilltheir knots be strong,

321
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.130
And tempt not yet thebrushes of the war.

322
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:24.800
Unarm thee, go, and doubtthou not, brave boy,

323
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.230
I'll stand to-day for theeand me and Troy.

324
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:31.000
Brother, you have a viceof mercy in you,

325
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.330
Which better fits a lionthan a man.

326
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.370
What vice is that, goodTroilus? chide me for it.

327
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:37.130
When many times thecaptive Grecian falls,

328
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.130
Even in the fan and windof your fair sword,

329
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.630
You bid them rise, andlive.

330
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:41.770
O,'tis fair play.

331
00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.200
Fool's play, by heaven,Hector.

332
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.200
How now! how now!

333
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.830
For the love of all thegods,

334
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.830
Let's leave the hermitpity with our mothers,

335
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.630
And when we have ourarmours buckled on,

336
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:57.630
The venom'd vengeance rideupon our swords,

337
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:02.930
Spur them to ruthful work,rein them from ruth.

338
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:03.830
Fie, savage, fie!

339
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.170
Hector, then 'tis wars.

340
00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:08.430
Troilus, I would not haveyou fight to-day.

341
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.830
Who should withhold me?

342
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.400
Not fate, obedience, northe hand of Mars

343
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.100
Beckoning with fierytruncheon my retire;

344
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.570
Not Priamus and Hecuba onknees,

345
00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.230
Their eyes o'ergalled withrecourse of tears;

346
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.400
Not you, my brother, withyour true sword drawn,

347
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.830
Opposed to hinder me,should stop my way,

348
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.100
But by my ruin.

349
00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.870
Lay hold upon him, Priam,hold him fast:

350
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.330
He is thy crutch; now ifthou lose thy stay,

351
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.030
Thou on him leaning, andall Troy on thee,

352
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.630
Fall all together.

353
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:50.170
Come, Hector, come, goback:

354
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:54.170
Thy wife hath dream'd; thymother hath had visions;

355
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.630
Cassandra doth foresee;and I myself

356
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.900
Am like a prophet suddenlyenrapt

357
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.200
To tell thee that this dayis ominous:

358
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.800
Therefore, come back.

359
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.630
AEneas is a-field;

360
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.000
And I do stand engaged tomany Greeks,

361
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.500
Even in the faith ofvalour, to appear

362
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.900
This morning to them.

363
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.170
Ay, but thou shalt not go.

364
00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.670
I must not break my faith.

365
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.330
You know me dutiful;therefore, dear sir,

366
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:18.870
Let me not shame respect;but give me leave

367
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.530
To take that course byyour consent and voice,

368
00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.030
Which you do here forbidme, royal Priam.

369
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.730
O Priam, yield not to him!

370
00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:27.900
Do not, dear father.

371
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.430
Andromache, I am offendedwith you:

372
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:30.400
Upon the love you bear me,get you in.

373
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.070
This foolish, dreaming,superstitious girl

374
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.130
Makes all these bodements.

375
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.370
O, farewell, dear Hector!

376
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:41.930
Look, how thou diest! look,how thy eye turns pale!

377
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.930
Look, how thy wounds dobleed at many vents!

378
00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:51.400
Hark, how Troy roars! howHecuba cries out!

379
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.500
How poor Andromacheshrills her dolours forth!

380
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.330
Behold, distraction,frenzy and amazement,

381
00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:02.130
Like witless antics, oneanother meet,

382
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:08.200
And all cry, Hector!Hector's dead! O Hector!

383
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.100
Away! away!

384
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:16.970
Farewell: yet, soft!Hector! take my leave:

385
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:22.270
Thou dost thyself and allour Troy deceive.

386
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:28.400
You are amazed, my liege,at her exclaim:

387
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.630
Go in and cheer the town:we'll forth and fight,

388
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:38.130
Do deeds worth praise andtell you them at night.

389
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:43.600
Farewell: the gods withsafety stand about thee!

390
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:49.430
(♪horns sound)

391
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:52.670
They are at it, hark!Proud Diomed, believe,

392
00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.170
I come to lose my arm, orwin my sleeve.

393
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.630
Do you hear, my lord? doyou hear?

394
00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:00.200
What now?

395
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.800
Here's a letter come fromyond poor girl.

396
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:07.930
Let me read.

397
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.470
A whoreson tisick,

398
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:12.200
a whoreson rascallytisick so troubles me,

399
00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.830
and the foolishfortune of this girl;

400
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.030
and what one thing,what another,

401
00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.800
that I shall leave youone o' these days:

402
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.170
and I have a rheumin mine eyes too,

403
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.870
and such an achein my bones that,

404
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:29.130
unless a man were cursed, Icannot tell what to think on't.

405
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.400
What says she there?

406
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:38.530
Words, words, mere words,no matter from the heart:

407
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:42.830
The effect doth operateanother way.

408
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:48.030
Go, wind, to wind, thereturn and change together.

409
00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:51.700
My love with words anderrors still she feeds;

410
00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.830
But edifies another withher deeds.

411
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:23.000
Now they are clapper-clawingone another;

412
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.900
That dissembling abominablevarlets Diomed,

413
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.700
has got that same scurvy doting

414
00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.600
foolish young knave's sleeveof Troy there in his helm:

415
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.100
I would fain see them meet;

416
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.230
that that sameyoung Trojan ass,

417
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.500
that loves the whore there,

418
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.700
might send that Greekishwhore-masterly villain,

419
00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:43.070
with the sleeve, back to thedissembling luxurious drab,

420
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.370
of a sleeveless errand.

421
00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:47.430
O' the t'other side,

422
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:50.670
the policy of thosecrafty swearing rascals,

423
00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:52.670
that stale oldmouse-eaten dry cheese,

424
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:55.570
Nestor, and that samedog-fox, Ulysses,

425
00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.970
is not proved worthya blackberry:

426
00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:00.770
they set me up, in policy,that mongrel cur, Ajax,

427
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:03.870
against that dog of asbad a kind, Achilles:

428
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:07.230
and now is the cur Ajax prouderthan the cur Achilles,

429
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:09.330
and will not arm to-day;

430
00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:13.730
whereupon the Grecians beginto proclaim barbarism,

431
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.270
and policy grows intoan ill opinion.

432
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:22.600
Soft! here comes sleeve,and t'other.

433
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.930
Fly not; for shouldst thoutake the river Styx,

434
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:25.400
I would swim after.

435
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.770
Thou dost miscall retire:

436
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:28.830
I do not fly, butadvantageous care

437
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.130
Withdrew me from the oddsof multitude:

438
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:32.370
Have at thee!

439
00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:37.670
Hold thy whore, Grecian!--nowfor thy whore, Trojan!

440
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:39.800
What art thou, Greek? artthou for Hector's match?

441
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.200
Art thou of blood andhonour?

442
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.200
No, no, I am a rascal; ascurvy railing knave:

443
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.000
a very filthy rogue.

444
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.170
I do believe thee: live.

445
00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:55.270
God-a-mercy, that thouwilt believe me;

446
00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.770
but a plague break thyneck for frightening me!

447
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:02.300
What's become of thewenching rogues?

448
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.600
I think they haveswallowed one another:

449
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.570
I'll seek them.

450
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:17.930
Renew, renew! The fiercePolydamas

451
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.470
Hath beat down Menon:bastard Margarelon

452
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.830
Hath Doreus prisoner,

453
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:25.030
And stands colossus-wise,waving his beam,

454
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.430
Upon the pashed corses ofthe kings

455
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:32.330
Epistrophus and Cedius:Polyxenes is slain,

456
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:35.400
Amphimachus and Thoasdeadly hurt,

457
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:39.370
Patroclus ta'en or slain,and Palamedes

458
00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:41.870
Sore hurt and bruised: thedreadful Sagittary

459
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.700
Appals our numbers: hastewe, Diomed,

460
00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.670
To reinforcement, or weperish all.

461
00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:48.870
Go, bear Patroclus' bodyto Achilles;

462
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.200
And bid the snail-pacedAjax arm for shame.

463
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.570
There is a thousandHectors in the field:

464
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.530
Now here he fights onGalathe his horse,

465
00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:59.570
And there lacks work; anonhe's there afoot,

466
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:01.870
And there they fly or die,like scaled sculls

467
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:05.930
Before the belching whale;then is he yonder,

468
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:08.100
And there the strawyGreeks, ripe for his edge,

469
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.630
Fall down before him, likethe mower's swath:

470
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.700
Here, there, and everywhere, he leaves and takes,

471
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.700
Dexterity so obeyingappetite

472
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.270
That what he will he does,and does so much

473
00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.000
That proof is call'dimpossibility.

474
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.400
O, courage, courage,princes! great Achilles

475
00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.830
Is arming, weeping,cursing, vowing vengeance:

476
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.300
Patroclus' wounds haveroused his drowsy blood,

477
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.330
Together with his mangledMyrmidons,

478
00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.370
That noseless, handless, hack'dand chipp'd, come to him,

479
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.770
Crying on Hector. Ajaxhath lost a friend

480
00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.530
And foams at mouth, and heis arm'd and at it,

481
00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:40.600
Roaring for Troilus, whohath done to-day

482
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.830
Mad and fantasticexecution,

483
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:44.300
Engaging and redeeming ofhimself

484
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.030
With such a careless forceand forceless care

485
00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:49.470
As if that luck, in veryspite of cunning,

486
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:52.200
Bade him win all.

487
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.030
Troilus, thou cowardTroilus, show thy head!

488
00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.530
Troilus, I say! where'sTroilus?

489
00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.300
What wouldst thou?

490
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.600
I would correct him.

491
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.130
Were I the general, thoushouldst have my office

492
00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.830
Ere that correction. Troilus,I say!

493
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:10.970
O traitor Diomed! turn thyfalse face, thou traitor,

494
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:12.370
Ha, art thou there?

495
00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:16.630
I'll fight with him alone:stand, Diomed.

496
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:18.600
He is my prize; I will notlook upon.

497
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.930
Come, both you coggingGreeks; have at you both!

498
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:32.070
Yea, Troilus? O, wellfought, my youngest brother!

499
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:47.800
Stand, stand, thou Greek;thou art a goodly mark:

500
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.370
No? wilt thou not? I likethy armour well;

501
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:55.570
I'll frush it and unlockthe rivets all,

502
00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.770
But I'll be master of it:

503
00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.370
Come here about me, you myMyrmidons;

504
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:06.370
Mark what I say. Attend mewhere I wheel:

505
00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:10.070
Strike not a stroke, butkeep yourselves in breath:

506
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.830
And when I have the bloodyHector found,

507
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:17.000
Empale him with yourweapons round about;

508
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.600
In fellest manner executeyour aims.

509
00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:25.300
Follow me, sirs, and myproceedings eye:

510
00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:29.170
It is decreed Hector thegreat must die.

511
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.030
The cuckold and thecuckold-maker are at it.

512
00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:47.370
Now, bull! now, dog!'Loo, Paris, 'loo!

513
00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:48.670
'loo, Paris, 'loo!

514
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.230
The bull has the game:ware horns, ho!

515
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.570
Turn, slave, and fight.

516
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:56.870
What art thou?

517
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:59.470
A bastard son of Priam's.

518
00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:03.400
I am a bastard too; I lovebastards: I am a bastard begot,

519
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.100
bastard instructed,bastard in mind,

520
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.630
bastard in valour, inevery thing illegitimate.

521
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:09.570
One bear will not bite another,

522
00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.030
and wherefore shouldone bastard?

523
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:12.970
Take heed,

524
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:13.970
if the son of a whorefight for a whore,

525
00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:17.400
he tempts judgment:farewell, bastard.

526
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.330
The devil take thee,coward!

527
00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:35.900
Most putrefied core, sofair without,

528
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:39.870
Thy goodly armour thushath cost thy life.

529
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:49.630
Now is my day's work done;I'll take good breath:

530
00:30:52.330 --> 00:31:01.300
Rest, sword; thou hast thyfill of blood and death.

531
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:14.770
Look, Hector, how the sunbegins to set;

532
00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:17.800
How ugly night comesbreathing at his heels:

533
00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.370
Even with the vail anddarking of the sun,

534
00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:28.330
To close the day up,Hector's life is done.

535
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:39.770
I am unarm'd; forego thisvantage, Greek.

536
00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.200
Strike, fellows, strike;this is the man I seek.

537
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:08.470
So, Ilion, fall thou next!now, Troy, sink down!

538
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:16.700
Here lies thy heart, thysinews, and thy bone.

539
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.030
On, Myrmidons, and cry youall amain,

540
00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:23.730
'Achilles hath the mightyHector slain.'

541
00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:25.600
(A retreat sounded)

542
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:31.230
Hark! a retire upon ourGrecian part.

543
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:35.170
The dragon wing of nighto'erspreads the earth,

544
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:39.730
And, stickler-like, thearmies separates.

545
00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:43.030
My half-supp'd sword, thatfrankly would have fed,

546
00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:47.130
Pleased with this daintybait, thus goes to bed.

547
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:52.270
Come, tie his body to myhorse's tail;

548
00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:57.230
Along the field I will theTrojan trail.

549
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:04.900
Stand, ho! yet are wemasters of the field:

550
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:08.930
Never go home; here starvewe out the night.

551
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:10.700
Hector is slain.

552
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.970
Hector! the gods forbid!

553
00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.300
He's dead; and at themurderer's horse's tail,

554
00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.270
In beastly sort, dragg'dthrough the shameful field.

555
00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:22.970
Frown on, you heavens,effect your rage with speed!

556
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:28.230
Sit, gods, upon yourthrones, and smile at Troy!

557
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:33.230
I say, at once let yourbrief plagues be mercy,

558
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:35.700
And linger not our suredestructions on!

559
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.970
My lord, you do discomfortall the host!

560
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.000
You understand me not thattell me so:

561
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.900
I do not speak of flight,of fear, of death,

562
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.770
But dare all imminencethat gods and men

563
00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:47.330
Address their dangers in.Hector is gone:

564
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.700
Who shall tell Priam so,or Hecuba?

565
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.270
Let him that will ascreech-owl aye be call'd,

566
00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:54.730
Go in to Troy, and saythere, Hector's dead:

567
00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:57.800
There is a word will Priamturn to stone;

568
00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.730
Make wells and Niobes ofthe maids and wives,

569
00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:03.130
Cold statues of the youth,and, in a word,

570
00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:07.630
Scare Troy out of itself.But, march away:

571
00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:11.470
Hector is dead; there isno more to say.

572
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:23.200
Stay yet. You vileabominable tents,

573
00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:29.600
Thus proudly pight uponour Phrygian plains,

574
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.570
Let Titan rise as early ashe dare,

575
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:38.570
I'll through and through you!and, thou great-sized coward,

576
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.400
No space of earth shallsunder our two hates:

577
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.600
I'll haunt thee like awicked conscience still,

578
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:49.670
That mouldeth goblins swiftas frenzy's thoughts.

579
00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:54.770
Strike a free march toTroy! with comfort go:

580
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:58.100
Hope of revenge shall hideour inward woe.

581
00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.470
But hear you, hear you!

582
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.800
Hence, broker-lackey!ignomy and shame

583
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.130
Pursue thy life, and liveaye with thy name!

584
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:16.700
A goodly medicine for myaching bones! O world!

585
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:22.930
world! world! thus is thepoor agent despised!

586
00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:25.930
O traitors and bawds, howearnestly are you set

587
00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:30.500
a-work, and how ill requited!

588
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:35.930
why should ourendeavour be so loved

589
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:42.570
and the performance soloathed? what instance for it?

590
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:47.930
what verse forit? Let me see:

591
00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:57.470
Full merrily thehumble-bee doth sing,

592
00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:05.570
Till he hath lost hishoney and his sting;

593
00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:13.830
And being once subdued inarmed tail,

594
00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:22.430
Sweet honey and sweetnotes together fail.

595
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:36.300
Good traders in the flesh, setthis in your painted cloths.

596
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:46.370
As many as be here ofpander's hall,

597
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.570
Your eyes, half out, weepout at Pandar's fall;

598
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.870
Or if you cannot weep, yetgive some groans,

599
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:06.670
Though not for me, yet foryour aching bones.

600
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.970
Brethren and sisters ofthe hold-door trade,

601
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:20.600
Some two months hence mywill shall here be made:

602
00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:28.070
Till then I'll sweat andseek about for eases,

603
00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:36.600
And at that time bequeatheyou my diseases.

604
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:54.100
