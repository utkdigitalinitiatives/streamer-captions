00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.430


2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.930
Not see him since?

3
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.400
Sir, sir, that cannot be!

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.330
But were I not the better part made mercy,

5
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.730
I should not seek

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.270
an absent argument of my revenge, thou peasant.

7
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.400
So look to it!

8
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.970
Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is!

9
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.170
Seek him with candle!

10
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.370
Bring him dead or living within this twelvemonth,

11
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.100
or turn thou no more

12
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.870
to seek a living in our territories.

13
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.000
Thy lands and all things

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.800
that thou dost call thine worth seizure

15
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.530
do we seize into our hands

16
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.470
till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth

17
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.230
of what we think against thee.

18
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.970
O that your highness knew my heart in this.

19
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.170
I never loved my brother in my life.

20
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.170
More villain thou.

21
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.330
Well, push him out of doors!

22
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.530
And let my officers of such a nature

23
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.000
make an extent upon his house and lands.

24
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.070
Do this expediently, and turn him going!

25
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.100
Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:

26
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.930
And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey

27
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.730
with thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above

28
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.700
thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.

29
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.000
O Rosalind,

30
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.900
these trees shall be my books,

31
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.330
and in their barks, my thoughts I'll character

32
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.830
that every eye which in this forest looks

33
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.170
shall see thy virtue witness'd everywhere.

34
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.770
Run, run, Orlando.

35
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.770
Carve on every tree

36
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.800
the fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she.

37
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.900
Uh.

38
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.000
And how like you this shepherd's life,

39
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.770
Master Touchstone?

40
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.770
Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself,

41
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.370
it is a good life,

42
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.570
but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,

43
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.530
it is naught.

44
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.370
In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well,

45
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.800
but in respect that it is private,

46
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.930
it is a very vile life.

47
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.870
Now, in respect it is in the fields,

48
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.330
it pleaseth me well;

49
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.370
but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious.

50
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.300
As is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humor well;

51
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.570
but as there is no more plenty in it,

52
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.670
it goes much against my stomach.

53
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.970
Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?

54
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.430
No more but that I know the more one sickens,

55
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.500
the worse at ease he is

56
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.570
and that he that wants money, means, and content

57
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.770
is without three good friends;

58
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.030
the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn;

59
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.900
that good pasture makes fat sheep

60
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.300
and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun;

61
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.900
that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art

62
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.470
may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.

63
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.570
Such a one is a natural philosopher.

64
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.330
Wast ever in court, shepherd?

65
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.630
No, truly.

66
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.300
Then thou art damned.

67
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.570
Nay, I hope.

68
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.800
Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg,

69
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.030
all on one side.

70
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.700
For not being at court?

71
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.930
Oh, your reason?

72
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.500
Why, if thou never wast at court,

73
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.000
thou never sawest good manners;

74
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.170
if thou never sawest good manners, thy manners must be wicked;

75
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.330
and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation.

76
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.270
Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.

77
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.400
Not a whit, Touchstone:

78
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.400
those that are good manners at the court

79
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.900
are as ridiculous in the country

80
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.670
as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court.

81
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.470
You told me that you salute not at the court,

82
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.130
but you kiss your hands.

83
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.870
That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.

84
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.500
Instance, briefly; come, instance.

85
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.730
Why, we are still handling our ewes,

86
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.730
and their fells, you know, are greasy.

87
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.770
Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat?

88
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.770
And is not the grease of a mutton

89
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.630
as wholesome as the sweat of a man?

90
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.770
Shallow, shallow.

91
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.570
A better instance, I say; come.

92
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.230
Besides, our hands are hard.

93
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.030
Your lips will feel them the sooner.

94
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.230
Shallow again.

95
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.370
A more sounder instance, come.

96
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.870
And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep:

97
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.870
and would you have us kiss tar?

98
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.000
The courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.

99
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.470
Most shallow man,

100
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.400
thou worm's meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed.

101
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.500
Learn of the wise, and perpend.

102
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.530
Civet is of a baser birth than tar,

103
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.430
the very uncleanly flux of a cat.

104
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.430
Mend the instance, shepherd.

105
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.400
You have too courtly a wit for me.

106
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.700
I'll rest.

107
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.170
Wilt thou rest damned?

108
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.330
God help thee, shallow man.

109
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.970
God make incision in thee.

110
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.070
Thou art raw.

111
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.300
Sir, I am a true laborer.

112
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.270
I earn that I eat,

113
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.730
get that I wear,

114
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.930
owe no man hate,

115
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.900
envy no man's happiness,

116
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.800
glad of other men's good,

117
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.430
content with my harm,

118
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.800
and the greatest of my pride

119
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.600
is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.

120
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.770
That is another simple sin in you,

121
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.530
to bring the ewes and the rams together

122
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.900
and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle.

123
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.570
If thou beest not damned for this,

124
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.530
the devil himself will have no shepherds.

125
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.900
I cannot see else how thou shouldst 'scape.

126
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.830
"From the east to western Ind,

127
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.370
"no jewel is like Rosalind.

128
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.330
"Her worth, being mounted on the wi--

129
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.870
"wind,

130
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.570
"through all the world bears Rosalind.

131
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.400
"All the pictures fairest lined

132
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.670
"are but black to Rosalind.

133
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.030
"Let no face be kept in mind

134
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.370
but the fair of Rosalind."

135
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.570
I'll rhyme you so eight years together,

136
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.130
dinners and suppers and sleeping-hours excepted.

137
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.270
This is the right butter-women's rank to market.

138
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.500
Out, fool.

139
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.700
For a taste:

140
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.000
If a hart do lack a hind,

141
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.300
let him seek out Rosalind.

142
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.930
If the cat will after kind,

143
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.570
so be sure will Rosalind.

144
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.500
Winter garments must be lined.

145
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.030
so must slender Rosalind.

146
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.200
They that reap must sheaf and bind;

147
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.470
then to cart with Rosalind.

148
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.370
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind.

149
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.330
Such a nut is Rosalind.

150
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.770
He that sweetest rose will find

151
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.400
must find love's prick and Rosalind.

152
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.270
This is the very false gallop of verses.

153
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.400
Why do you infect yourself with them?

154
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.170
Peace, you dull fool.

155
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.000
I found them on a tree.

156
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.730
Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.

157
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.000
I'll graff it with you,

158
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.830
and then I shall graff it with a medlar.

159
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.870
and then, it will be the earliest fruit of the country;

160
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.130
for you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe,

161
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.100
and that's the right virtue of the medlar.

162
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.470
Ooh, you have said,but whether wisely or no,

163
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.500
let the forest judge.

164
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.470
Peace, here comes my sister, reading.

165
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.470
Let's stand aside.

166
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.330
"Why should this a desert be?

167
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.970
"For it is unpeopled?

168
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:04.700
"No.

169
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.670
"Tongues I'll hang on every tree

170
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.470

171
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:11.770
Hmm.

172
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.470
"But upon the fairest boughs

185
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.170
"Thus Rosalind of many parts

186
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.570
"by heavenly synod was devised

187
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.470
"of many faces, eyes, and hearts

188
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.600
"to have the touches dearest prized.

189
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.200
"Heaven would that she these gifts should have

190
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.570
and I to live and die her slave."

191
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.130
O most gentle pulpiter!

192
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.670
What tedious homily of love

193
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.730
have you wearied your parishioners withal

194
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.500
and never cried, "Have patience, good people."

195
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.130
How now.

196
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.730
Back, friends.

197
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.300
Shepherd, go off a little.

198
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.300
Go with him, sirrah.

199
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.170
Come, shepherd, let us make an honorable retreat,

200
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.900
though not with bag and baggage,

201
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.330
yet with scrip and scrippage.

202
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.830
Didst thou hear these verses?

203
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.100
O, yes, I heard them all and more too,

204
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.630
for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.

205
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.600
But didst thou hear without wondering

206
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.370
how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees?

207
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.730
I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder

208
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.230
before you came,

209
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.630
for look you here what I found on a palm tree.

210
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.300
I was never so be-rhymed since Pythagoras' time

211
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.170
that I was an Irish rat that I can hardly remember.

212
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.000
Trow you who hath done this?

213
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.300
Is it a man?

214
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.470
Mm-hmm.

215
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.700
And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.

216
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.070
Change you color?

217
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.300
I prithee, who?

218
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.570
O Lord, Lord.

219
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.400
It is a hard matter for friends to meet,

220
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.100
but mountains may be removed with earthquakes

221
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.470
and so encounter.

222
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.130
Nay, but who is it?

223
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.400
Is it possible?

224
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.730
Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,

225
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.030
tell me who it is.

226
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.730
O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful.

227
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.030
Wonderful, and yet again wonderful,

228
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.570
and after that, out of all hooping.

229
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.670
Good my complexion, dost thou think,

230
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.370
though I am caparisoned like a man,

231
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.200
I have a doublet and hose in my disposition?

232
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.170
One inch of delay more is a South sea of discovery.

233
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.730
I prithee, tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace.

234
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.500
I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth

235
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.770
that I may drink thy tidings.

236
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.670
So you may put a man in your belly.

237
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.300
Is he of God's making?

238
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.670
What manner of man?

239
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.430
Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?

240
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.100
Nay, he hath but a little beard.

241
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.470
Why, God will send him more if the man will be thankful.

242
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.370
Let me stay the growth of his beard

243
00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:16.670
if you delay me not the knowledge of his chin.

244
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.670
No.

245
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.970
It is young Orlando

246
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.830
that tripped up the wrestler's heels

247
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.700
and your heart both in an instant.

248
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.400
Nay, but the devil take mocking.

249
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.270
Speak, sad brow and true maid.

250
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.230
I' faith, coz, 'tis he.

251
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.670
Orlando?

252
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.670
Orlando.

253
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.400
Oh.

254
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.730
Oh.

255
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.430
Alas the day!

256
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.570
What shall I do with my doublet and hose?

257
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.130
Oh.

258
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.700
What did he when thou sawest him?

259
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.900
What said he?

260
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.100
How looked he?

261
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.300
Wherein went he?

262
00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.530
What makes he here?

263
00:11:58.530 --> 00:11:59.770
Did he ask for me?

264
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.000
Where remains he?

265
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.270
How parted he with thee?

266
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.270
And when shalt thou see him again?

267
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.430
Answer me in one word.

268
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.400
You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first.

269
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.700
'Tis a word too great

270
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.270
for any mouth of this age's size.

271
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:16.470
Oh, but--but doth he know that I am in this forest?

272
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.370
And in man's apparel?

273
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.900
Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?

274
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.670
It's as easy to count atomies

275
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.630
as to resolve the propositions of a lover,

276
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.430
but take a taste of my finding him,

277
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.600
and relish it with good observance.

278
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.230
I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.

279
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.630
It may well be called Jove's tree

280
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.000
when it drops forth such fruit.

281
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.130
Give me audience, good madam.

282
00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.600
Proceed.

283
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.900
There lay he, stretched along like a wounded knight.

284
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.870
Oh, though it be pity to see such a sight,

285
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.030
yet it well becomes the ground.

286
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.730
Cry holla to thy tongue, I prithee.

287
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.830
It curvets unseasonably.

288
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.500
He was furnished like a hunter.

289
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.670
O, ominous.

290
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.430
He comes to kill my heart.

291
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.870
I would sing my song without a burden.

292
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.430
Thou bringest me out of tune.

293
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.230
Do you not know I am a woman?

294
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.630
When I think, I must speak.

295
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.470
Sweet, say on.

296
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.800
You bring me out.

297
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.000
Soft.

298
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.130
Comes he not here?

299
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:29.470
'Tis he.

300
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.470
Slink by, and note him.

301
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.600
Oh!

302
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.300
I thank you for your company,

303
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.900
but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone.

304
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.200
And so had I, but yet, for fashion sake,

305
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.800
I thank you too for your society.

306
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.030
God by you.

307
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.600
Let's meet as little as we can.

308
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.670
I do desire we may be better strangers.

309
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.570
I pray you,

310
00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:57.870
mar no more trees

311
00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.800
with writing love songs in their barks.

312
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.670
I pray you, mar no more of my verses

313
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.270
with reading them ill-favoredly.

314
00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.100
Rosalind is your love's name?

315
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.270
Yes, just.

316
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.570
I do not like her name.

317
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.300
There was no thought of pleasing you

318
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.730
when she was christened.

319
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.230
What stature is she of?

320
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.730
Just as high as my heart.

321
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.300
You are full of pretty answers.

322
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.730
Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths' wives

323
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.100
and conned them out of rings?

324
00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.700
Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth

325
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.830
from whence you have studied your questions.

326
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.130
You have a nimble wit.

327
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:38.330
I think 'twas made of Atalanta's heels.

328
00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:39.630
Will you sit down with me?

329
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.970
And we two will rail against our mistress the world

330
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.900
and all our misery.

331
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.670
I will chide no breather in the world except myself,

332
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.800
against whom I know most faults.

333
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.930
The worst fault you have is to be in love.

334
00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:56.370
'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.

335
00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.270
I am weary of you.

336
00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.870
By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.

337
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.130
He is drowned in the brook.

338
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:04.370
Look but in, and you shall see him.

339
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.370
There I shall see mine own figure.

340
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:12.030
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.

341
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.770
I'll tarry no longer with you.

342
00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.600
Farewell, good Signior Love.

343
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.100
I am glad of your departure.

344
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.030
Adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy.

345
00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.370
I'll speak to him like a saucy lackey

346
00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:35.300
and under that habit play the knave with him.

347
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.700
Do you hear, forester?

348
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:40.100
Very well.

349
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.200
What would you?

350
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.770
I pray you, what is't o'clock?

351
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.730
You should ask me what time o' day.

352
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.970
There's no clock in the forest.

353
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.300
Then there is no true lover in the forest,

354
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.200
else sighing every minute and groaning every hour

355
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.800
would detect the lazy foot of Time

356
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.030
as well as a clock.

357
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.030
And why not the swift foot of Time?

358
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.970
Had not that been as proper?

359
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:05.630
By no means, sir.

360
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:09.500
Time travels in divers paces with divers persons.

361
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.500
I'll tell you who Time ambles withal,

362
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.730
who Time trots withal, who Time gallops withal,

363
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.530
and who he stands still withal.

364
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:21.970
I prithee, who doth he trot withal?

365
00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.230
Marry, he trots hard with a young maid

366
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.000
between the contract of her marriage

367
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.600
and the--the--and the day that it is solemnized,

368
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.970
for if the interim be but a se'nnight,

369
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.530
Time's pace is so hard it seems the length of seven year.

370
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.500
Who ambles Time withal?

371
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.430
With a priest that lacks Latin

372
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.600
and a rich man that hath not the gout,

373
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.230
for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study;

374
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.570
the other lives merrily because he feels no pain,

375
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.030
the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning,

376
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:56.530
the other feeling no burden of heavy tedious penury.

377
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.670
These, Time ambles withal.

378
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.170
Who doth he gallop withal?

379
00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:03.500
With a thief to the gallows,

380
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.830
for though he go as soft as foot can fall,

381
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:08.070
he thinks himself too soon there.

382
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:12.230
Who stays it still withal?

383
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:19.430
With lawyers in the vacation,

384
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.300
for they sleep between term and term

385
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.470
and then they perceive not how Time moves.

386
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.570
Where dwell you, pretty youth?

387
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:32.830
With this shepherdess,

388
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:33.930
my sister,

389
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.770
here in the skirts of the forest

390
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.970
like fringe upon a petticoat.

391
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.130
Are you native of this place?

392
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.730
As the cony you see dwell where she is kindled.

393
00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.230
Your accent is something finer

394
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.300
than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling.

395
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.400
I have been told so of many,

396
00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.270
and indeed, an old religious uncle of mine

397
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.730
taught me to speak,

398
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.700
who was in his youth an inland man,

399
00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.770
one that knew courtship too well,

400
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:02.070
for there he fell in love,

401
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.400
and I have heard him read many lectures against it,

402
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.230
and indeed, I thank God I am not a woman,

403
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.630
to be touched with so many giddy offences

404
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.230
as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.

405
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.370
Can you remember any of the principal evils

406
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.970
that he lay to the charge of women?

407
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.270
There were none principal.

408
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:21.530
They were all like one another as half pence are,

409
00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.130
the one fault seeming monstrous

410
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.030
till his fellow fault came to match it.

411
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.170
I prithee, recount some of them.

412
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.970
No, I will not cast away my physic

413
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.200
but upon those that are sick.

414
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.830
There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants

415
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.230
with carving "R-R-Rosalind" on their barks,

416
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:45.030
hangs odes upon hawthorns, elegies upon brambles,

417
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:48.630
all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind.

418
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.570
If I could meet that fancy-monger,

419
00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.330
I would give him some good counsel,

420
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.230
for he hath the quotidian of love upon him.

421
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.830
I am he that is so love-shaked.

422
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.100
I pray you, tell me your remedy.

423
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.200
There is none of my uncle's marks upon you.

424
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.470
He taught me how to know a man in love,

425
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.470
in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.

426
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.000
And what were his marks?

427
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.630
A lean cheek, which you have not;

428
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.100
a blue eye and sunken, which you have not;

429
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.570
an unquestionable spirit, which you have not;

430
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.530
a beard neglected, which you have not;

431
00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.070
but I pardon you for that,

432
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:29.170
for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue.

433
00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.930
Then your hose should be ungartered,

434
00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.370
your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned,

435
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:35.500
your shoe untied,

436
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.770
everything about you

437
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.830
demonstrating a careless desolation;

438
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.200
but you are no such man.

439
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.270
You are rather point-device in your accoutrements

440
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.730
as loving yourself

441
00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.500
than seeming the lover of any other.

442
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.630
Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe,

443
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:54.030
I love.

444
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:58.200
Me, believe it?

445
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.970
You may as soon make her that you love believe it,

446
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:05.030
which, I warrant, she is apter to do

447
00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.630
than to confess that she does.

448
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.600
That is one of the points in which women

449
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.130
still give the lie to their consciences.

450
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:17.730
But in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees

451
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.300
wherein Rosalind is so admired?

452
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.030
I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind,

453
00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.700
I am that he,

454
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.530
that unfortunate he.

455
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:34.030
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?

456
00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:37.700
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.

457
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.800
Ah, ha, ha!

458
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.700
Love is merely a madness and, I tell you,

459
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.100
deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do,

460
00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.200
and the only reason they are not so punished and cured

461
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.170
is that the lunacy is so ordinary

462
00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.700
the whippers are in love too.

463
00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:01.430
Yet I profess curing it by counsel.

464
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.430
Did you ever cure any so?

465
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:10.270
Yes, one, and in this manner:

466
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.730
he was to imagine me his love,

467
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.800
his mistress,

468
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.030
and I set him every day to woo me,

469
00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:26.600
at which time would I, being but a moonish youth,

470
00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:31.470
grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking,

471
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:35.530
proud, fantastical, full of tears, full of smiles,

472
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.500
for every passion something and for no passion truly anything

473
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.300
as boys and women are for the most part

474
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.400
cattle of this color;

475
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.130
now like him, now loathe him;

476
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.000
then entertain him, then forswear him;

477
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.470
now weep for him, then spit at him

478
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:54.630
that I drave my suitor from his mad humor of love

479
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.430
to a living humor of madness,

480
00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:01.300
which was to forswear the full stream of the world

481
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.530
and live in a nook merely monastic.

482
00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.600
And thus did I cure him,

483
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.600
and so will I take it on me

484
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.730
to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart,

485
00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:17.600
that there shall not be one spot of love in it.

486
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.530
I would not be cured, youth.

487
00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:26.900
I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind

488
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:31.800
and come to my cote every day and woo me.

489
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.300
Now, by the faith of my love, I will.

490
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.130
Tell me where it is.

491
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.130
Go with me to it, and I will show it to you,

492
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.400
and by the way,

493
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.670
you shall tell me where in the forest you live.

494
00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:51.100
Come; will you go?

495
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.300
With all my heart, good youth.

496
00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:58.270
Nay, you must call me Rosalind.

497
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:02.630
Come, sister, will you go?

498
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.900
Come apace, good Audrey.

499
00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.230
I will fetch up your goats, Audrey.

500
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.430
And how, Audrey?

501
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.030
Am I the man yet?

502
00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.330
Doth my simple feature content you?

503
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.800
Your features! Lord warrant us!

504
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.570
What features?

505
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.370
I am here with thee and thy goats

506
00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:42.430
as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid,

507
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:43.730
was among the Goths.

508
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.800
O knowledge ill-inhabited,

509
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.730
worse than Jove in a thatched house.

510
00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:51.300
When a man's verses can't be understood

511
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.670
or a man's good wit seconded

512
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:54.630
with the forward child understanding,

513
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.600
it strikes a man more dead

514
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.830
than a great reckoning in a little room.

515
00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:03.370
Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.

516
00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.730
I do not know what "poetical" is.

517
00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:07.770
Is it honest in deed and word?

518
00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.070
Is it a true thing?

519
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:12.570
No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most feigning;

520
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:15.400
and lovers are given to poetry,

521
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.200
and what they swear in poetry

522
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.430
may be said as lovers they do feign.

523
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.370
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?

524
00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:26.930
I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art honest.

525
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:28.970
Now, if thou wert a poet,

526
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.870
I might have some hope thou didst feign.

527
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.470
Oh, would you not have me honest?

528
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.670
No, truly--

529
00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.530
unless thou wert hard-favored,

530
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.470
for honesty coupled to beauty

531
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.670
is to have honey a sauce to sugar.

532
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:43.130
A material fool!

533
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:45.200
Well, I am not fair,

534
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.130
and therefore, I pray the gods make me honest.

535
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.330
Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut

536
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.670
were to put good meat into an unclean dish.

537
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:54.470
I am not a slut,

538
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:56.530
though I thank the gods I am foul.

539
00:24:56.530 --> 00:25:00.170
Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness.

540
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.430
Sluttishness may come hereafter.

541
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.830
But be it as it may be,

542
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:08.470
I will marry thee,

543
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:11.030
and to that end, I have been with Sir Oliver Martext,

544
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.570
the vicar of the next village,

545
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.070
who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest

546
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.930
and to couple us.

547
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.500
I would fain see this meeting.

548
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.230
Well, the gods give us joy!

549
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:21.670
Amen.

550
00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.500
Oh, a man may, if he were of a fearful heart,

551
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.630
stagger in this attempt,

552
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:29.370
for here we have no temple but the wood,

553
00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:31.830
no assembly but horn-beasts.

554
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.400
But what though?

555
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.530
Courage.

556
00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.670
As horns are odious, they are necessary.

557
00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:40.270
No, as a walled town is more worthier than a village,

558
00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:42.000
so is the forehead of a married man

559
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.670
more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor.

560
00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:45.930
Sir Oliver Martext,

561
00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:47.530
you are well met.

562
00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.600
Will you dispatch us here under this tree?

563
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.370
Or shall we go with you to your chapel?

564
00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:54.270
Yes, yes, yes.

565
00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:57.230
I-I-Is there none here to give the woman?

566
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:59.130
I will not take her on gift of any man.

567
00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.830
Truly, sir, she must be given,

568
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.070
or the marriage is not lawful.

569
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:06.230
Proceed, proceed.

570
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.470
I'll give her.

571
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:09.400
Good even, good Master What-ye-call't.

572
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.500
How do you, sir?

573
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.800
You are very well met.

574
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.000
I am very glad to see you--

575
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.930
even a toy in hand here, sir.

576
00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.400
Nay, pray be covered.

577
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.770
Will you be married, motley?

578
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:20.300
As the ox hath his bow, sir,

579
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.500
and the horse his curb and the falcon her bells,

580
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.100
so a man hath his desires;

581
00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.600
and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.

582
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.500
Will you, being a man of your breeding,

583
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.800
be married under a bush like a beggar?

584
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.670
Get you to church, and have a good priest

585
00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.130
that can tell you what marriage is.

586
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.100
This fellow will but join you together

587
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.900
as they join wainscot,

588
00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.370
and then one of you will prove a shrunk panel

589
00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:46.730
and, like green timber, warp--

590
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:50.700
warp.

591
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.430
I am not in the mind,

592
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.870
but I were better to be married of him than of another,

593
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:56.830
for he is not like to marry me well,

594
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:58.430
and not being well-married,

595
00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.500
it will be a good excuse for me hereafter

596
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.470
to leave my wife.

597
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.170
Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.

598
00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:08.970
'Come, sweet Audrey.

599
00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:11.270
We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.

600
00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:13.100
Farewell, good Master Oliver,

601
00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.930
not, "O sweet Oliver, O brave Oliver,

602
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:16.170
leave me not behind thee,"

603
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:17.330
but, "Wind away;

604
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:18.530
"Begone, I say,

605
00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.570
I will not to wedding with thee."

606
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:25.770
'Tis no matter.

607
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.900
There's ne'er a fantastical knave of them all

608
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.500
shall flout me out of my calling.

609
00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:44.970
Never talk to me.

610
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.170
I will weep.

611
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.070
Do, I prithee,

612
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.670
and yet have the grace to consider

613
00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:52.970
that tears do not become a man.

614
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:55.200
Have I not cause to weep?

615
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.630
As good a cause as one could desire.

616
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.170
Therefore, weep.

617
00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:02.870
His very hair is of the dissembling color.

618
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:05.700
Something browner than Judas's marry.

619
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.700
His kisses are Judas's own children.

620
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.630
I' faith, his hair is of a good color.

621
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.900
An excellent color.

622
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.930
Your chestnut was ever the only color.

623
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:19.270
And his kissing is as full of sanctity

624
00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.400
as is the touch of holy bread.

625
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:26.370
A nun of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously.

626
00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.600
There is the ice of chastity in them.

627
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.430
But why did he swear he would come this morning

628
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:36.170
and comes not?

629
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.130
Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.

630
00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:40.700
Not true in love?

631
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.070
When he is in, but I think he is not in.

632
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:45.430
But you have heard him swear downright he was.

633
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.230
"Was" is not "is."

634
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.800
Besides, the oath of a lover

635
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.530
is no stronger than the words of a tapster.

636
00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:59.500
They are both the confirmer of false reckonings.

637
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.130
Oh, he attends here in the forest

638
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:03.770
on the duke thy father.

639
00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:07.270
I met the duke yesterday and had much question with him.

640
00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.100
He asked me of what parentage I was.

641
00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:13.600
I told him of as good as he, and so he laughed and let me go.

642
00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.470
But what talk we of fathers

643
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.230
when there is such a man as Orlando?

644
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.970
O, there's a brave man.

645
00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:25.070
He writes brave verses, speaks brave words,

646
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:28.700
swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely,

647
00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.800
quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover.

648
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:35.170
But all's brave

649
00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.900
that youth mounts and folly guides.

650
00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.970
Mistress and master,

651
00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:41.530
you have oft inquired

652
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.500
after the shepherd who complain'd of love

653
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.700
who you saw sitting by me on the turf,

654
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.930
praising the proud disdainful shepherdess

655
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:49.030
that was his mistress.

656
00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.570
Well, and what of him?

657
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.630
If you would see a pageant truly play'd

658
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.800
between the pale complexion of true love

659
00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.030
and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,

660
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.330
go hence a little, and I shall conduct you

661
00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.000
if you will mark it.

662
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.830
O, come, let us remove.

663
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:06.230
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.

664
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:07.270
Oh.

665
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.100
Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me.

666
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:16.700
Do not.

667
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.800
Phebe.

668
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.800
Say that you love me not,

669
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.900
but say not so in bitterness.

670
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.900
The common executioner,

671
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.400
whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,

672
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.270
falls not the axe upon the humbled neck

673
00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:37.170
but first begs pardon.

674
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:39.100
Will you sterner be than he

675
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.930
that dies and lives by bloody drops?

676
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:43.830
I would not be thy executioner.

677
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:46.430
I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.

678
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.770
Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye.

679
00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.630
'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,

680
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:59.630
that eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things

681
00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:01.630
who shut their coward gates on atomies

682
00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.800
should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers.

683
00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.530
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart,

684
00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:12.430
and if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.

685
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.730
Counterfeit to swoon.

686
00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:16.430
Why now, fall down.

687
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:22.230
Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame.

688
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:25.570
Lie not to say mine eyes are murderers.

689
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:28.330
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.

690
00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:31.200
No, I am sure,

691
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.200
there is no force in eyes that can do hurt.

692
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.930
O dear Phebe,

693
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:39.500
if ever as that ever may be near

694
00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.330
you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,

695
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.370
then shall you know the wounds invisible

696
00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:47.070
that love's keen arrows make.

697
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:51.230
But till that time, come not thou near me,

698
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:52.770
and when that time comes,

699
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.570
afflict me with thy mocks.

700
00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:56.130
Pity me not,

701
00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:58.530
as till that time, I shall not pity thee.

702
00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:00.570
And why, I pray you?

703
00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:03.930
Who might be your mother

704
00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:06.930
that you insult, exult-- and all at once--

705
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:09.070
over the wretched?

706
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:10.700
What though you have no beauty--

707
00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.270
as, by my life, I see no more in you

708
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:15.700
than without candle may go dark to bed--

709
00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.070
must you be therefore proud and pitiless?

710
00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.530
Why, what means this?

711
00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:23.130
Why do you look on me?

712
00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:24.300
I see no more in you

713
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:27.600
than in the ordinary of nature's sale-work.

714
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.130
'Od's my little life,

715
00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:35.330
I think she means to tangle my eyes too.

716
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.400
No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it.

717
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:43.200
'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,

718
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.970
your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream

719
00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:49.400
that can entame my spirits to your worship.

720
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.470
You foolish shepherd,

721
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.970
why do you follow her

722
00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:58.200
like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?

723
00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:02.030
You are a thousand times a properer man than she a woman.

724
00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:03.370
'Tis such fools as you

725
00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:06.700
as makes the world full of ill-favor'd children:

726
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.730
'Tis not her glass but you that flatters her;

727
00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:12.370
and out of you, she sees herself more proper

728
00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.530
than any of her lineaments can show her.

729
00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:16.830
But, mistress, know yourself.

730
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.800
Down on your knees and thank heaven, fasting,

731
00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.870
for a good man's love,

732
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:28.000
for I must tell you friendly in your ear,

733
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.670
sell when you can.

734
00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:32.170
You are not for all markets.

735
00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:33.930
Cry the man mercy.

736
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.230
Love him.

737
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:36.470
Take his offer.

738
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:42.300
Foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer.

739
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.070
So take her to thee, shepherd.

740
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:45.330
Fare thee well.

741
00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:50.170
Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together.

742
00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:53.000
I'd rather hear you chide than this man woo.

743
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.400
He's fallen in love with your foulness,

744
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.170
and she'll fall in love with my anger.

745
00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.400
If it be so,

746
00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.700
as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks,

747
00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.100
I'll sauce her with bitter words.

748
00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.770
Why look you so on me?

749
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:08.100
For no ill will I bear you.

750
00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:12.900
I pray you, do not fall in love with me,

751
00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:16.570
for I am falser than vows made in wine.

752
00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:17.830
Besides, I like you not.

753
00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:19.300
I-If you will know my house,

754
00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.570
'tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.

755
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.970
Sister, will you go?

756
00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:29.070
Shepherd, ply her hard.

757
00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:30.470
Come, sister.

758
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:32.030
Shepherdess, look on him better,

759
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:33.700
and be not proud.

760
00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.700
Though all the world could see,

761
00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:38.070
none could be so abused in sight as he.

762
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:41.200
Come, to our flock.

763
00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:50.770
Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,

764
00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:54.600
"Whoever loved that loved not at first sight?"

765
00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.230
Sweet Phebe--

766
00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.330
Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?

767
00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:05.770
Sweet Phebe, pity me.

768
00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:08.870
Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.

769
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:11.500
Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.

770
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.300
If you do sorrow at my grief in love,

771
00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.800
then by giving love,

772
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.030
your sorrow and my grief were both extermined.

773
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:20.570
Thou hast my love.

774
00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:22.230
Is not that neighborly?

775
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:23.670
I would have you.

776
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:26.800
Why, that were covetousness.

777
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.500
Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,

778
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.830
and yet it is not that I bear thee love,

779
00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.670
but since that thou canst talk of love so well,

780
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.630
thy company, which erst was irksome to me,

781
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:38.800
I will endure,

782
00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.900
and I'll employ thee too.

783
00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.970
But do not look for further recompense

784
00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:45.370
than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.

785
00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:50.770
So holy and so perfect is my love

786
00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:53.100
and I in such a poverty of grace

787
00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:56.170
that I shall think it a most plenteous crop

788
00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:57.330
to glean the broken ears

789
00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:01.070
after the man that the main harvest reaps.

790
00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:04.770
Loose now and then a scatter'd smile,

791
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:06.030
and that I'll live upon.

792
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.870
Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?

793
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:16.200
Not very well, but I have met him oft,

794
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.270
and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds

795
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:20.330
that the old carlot once was master of.

796
00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:23.730
Think not I love him, though I ask for him.

797
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:26.030
'Tis but a peevish boy.

798
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:28.570
Yet he talks well.

799
00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:31.830
But what care I for words?

800
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:35.100
Yet words do well when he that speaks them

801
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.370
pleases those that hear.

802
00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:41.900
It is a pretty youth-- not very pretty--

803
00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.630
but, sure, he's proud,

804
00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.730
and yet his pride becomes him.

805
00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:47.630
He'll make a proper man.

806
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:52.500
The best thing in him is his complexion,

807
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.870
and faster than his tongue did make offence,

808
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:56.970
his eye did heal it up.

809
00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:58.170
He is not very tall.

810
00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.070
Yet for his years, he's tall.

811
00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:05.470
His leg is but so-so, and yet 'tis well.

812
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:08.700
There was a pretty redness in his lip,

813
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.830
a little riper and more lusty red than that mix'd in his cheek.

814
00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:13.070
'Twas just the difference

815
00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:18.030
betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.

816
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:19.530
There be some women, Silvius,

817
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.930
had they mark'd him in parcels as I did,

818
00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:24.100
would have gone near to fall in love with him,

819
00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.700
but, for my part, I love him not nor hate him not,

820
00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:32.170
and yet I have more cause to hate him than to love him.

821
00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:35.870
For what had he to do to chide at me?

822
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:41.430
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black

823
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:44.200
and, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me.

824
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.970
I marvel why I answer'd not again.

825
00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:49.370
But that's all one.

826
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:51.870
Omittance is no quittance.

827
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:53.930
I'll write to him a very taunting letter,

828
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:55.270
and thou shalt bear it.

829
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:56.370
Wilt thou, Silvius?

830
00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:57.630
Phebe, with all my heart.

831
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:58.800
I'll write it straight.

832
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.400
Go with me, Silvius.

833
00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:13.070
