WOMAN:

you're expecting

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.530
kids to say "Mom or Dad,"

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.330

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.960
NARRATOR:
The brain is wider than the sky,
for put them side by side,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.030
The one the other will contain
with ease, and you beside.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.300
The brain is deeper
than the sea,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.800
For hold them, blue to blue,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:57.600
The one the other will absorb,
as sponges, buckets do.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.030
The brain is just
the weight of God,

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.200
For heft them, pound for pound,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.660
And they will differ,
if they do,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.460
As syllable from sound.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.560
A child's brain--

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.230
a swirling profusion of billions
and billions of neurons,

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.930
reaching out
to billions more neurons

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.300
to form trillions of connections

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.100
pulsing with electric
and chemical energy.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.630
WOMAN:
Exuberant connectivity.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.260
The cells
literally are going wild

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.460
making all these connections,
discovering each other,

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.260
forming the basis of what
we call something learned.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.000
Learning is about connection.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.600
And connectivity.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.600
And exuberance.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.300
WOMAN:
You start with a block of
marble, like a sculptor would--

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.400
and there's
a lot of marble there.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.100
A young child has hundreds
of trillions of connections

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.800
in the brain, twice as many
connections as the adult.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.860
And then comes along
the sculptor,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.000
who takes away bits
of the marble to reveal a form.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.900
Experience is the sculptor;
experience determines

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.430
which of those connections
to take away and which to leave.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.400
That's what learning is:

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.960
it's changing the weights
of the connections in the brain,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.500
depending on experience.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.730
NARRATOR:
The child's brain is plastic,

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.130
a magnificent,
flexible engine for learning.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:13.160
A child learns to crawl,
then walk, run and explore.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.700
A child learns to reason,
to pay attention, and remember.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.160
A child learns to make friends.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.700
But nowhere
is learning more dramatic

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.030
than in the way a child
learns to master language,

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.000
the great leap
that the brain makes

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.060
that is nothing short
of a miracle.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.700
Hello? It's me, Rachel.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:08.060
(<i> speaking softly
 and unintelligibly</i> )

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.030
Oh, yeah.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.400
Oh, definitely then, bye.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.030
Bye.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.330
WOMAN:
So, has she started talking yet?

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.400
She talks, but we
don't understand her.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.430
Okay.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.530
(<i> all laughing</i> )

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.860
She says words, but there...
there is no meaning.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.960
Okay.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.160
WOMAN:
She probably
has about five words

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.460
that we can clearly understand.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.530
She says "kitty,"
she says "Elmo,"

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.100
she says "Daddy,"
she says "get,"

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.830
she says "woof,"
for doggy.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.160
Does she have
any other words, Nate?

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.200
Um, I think...
"Nate."

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.700
Oh, that's right,
she says "day," for "Nate,"

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.830
because that's him,
that's the big guy over here.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.260
Ooh... bubbles.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.830
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Want to talk?

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.430
Da, da, da, da.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.560
(<i> chuckling</i> )

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.560
Look at this!

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.560
Telephone.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.930
Hello, who's there?

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.160
(<i> baby squeals</i> )

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.460
Da, da, da?

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.400
Da, da, da?

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.130
Da, da, da?

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.900
Ooh, I got the queen!

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.930
WOMAN:
A queen?

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.060
Mm-hmm.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.160
WOMAN:
Language development represents

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.430
one of these profound
mysterious changes.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:22.830
Thanks.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.630
You're welcome, honey.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.660
Thanks!

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.030
(<i> laughing</i> )

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.300
You bring a baby home
from the hospital,

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.300
a wrinkly newborn
at seven pounds,

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.900
and within three years,
that child can talk in sentences

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.660
and speak to anyone
and deceive you with their words

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.900
and inspire you
with their words,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.130
and so it's,
"How does this come about?"

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.830
BOY:
Wow.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.330
GIRL:
Missed me.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.700
Michael, wait, stay there,
I want to do that, too.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.000
No, I'm going to do it
with my nanas, okay?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.100
Oh, yeah, I want
to get bananas,
too, that's...

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.360
That would be funny.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.660
No... (<i> unintelligible</i> )

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.760
I know, that's what
I'm going to try to do...

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.860
NARRATOR:
Nearly all children

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.560
learn to speak as easily
as a bird learns to sing.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.830
(<i> boy speaking excitedly,
 unintelligibly</i> )

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.300
NARRATOR:
Michael Blankenship
is an exception.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.300
My cart's...

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.700
NARRATOR:
At five years old,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.260
by the time most children
have mastered grammar,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.960
Michael still struggles
to make himself understood,

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.530
and no one yet understands why.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.530
Did that guy...?

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.600
Did you hear that?

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.400
Yeah, that guy
just hit me, went,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.060
(<i> imitating
 character shouting</i> )

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.730
WOMAN:
When Michael was at the age

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:39.160
where you're expecting
kids to say "Mom" or "Dad"

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.000
or some type of a noise,
he did not offer

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.160
to make any type of a sound,
didn't even try.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.830
All the other nieces
and nephews were

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.760
and we were noticing
that Michael wasn't.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.360
Get her, get her,
get her...

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.760
MOTHER:
I think Michael
was probably close

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.900
to two and a half to three
years old before he started

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.830
saying the normal words
that most kids start with.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:05.100
And even at that point, when he
would try to say "Mom" or "Dad,"

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.200
it was "Ma" and "Da."

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.530
He still couldn't
say the whole word.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:10.530
MICHAEL:
A pea!

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:11.600
SISTER:
Look, a peach.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.860
I don't like peachy.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.030
Michael, it's peach.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.160
Peach!

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
(<i> speaking unintelligibly</i> )

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.360
(<i> video game whistling</i> )

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.360
Nice try.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.360
(<i> father laughing</i> )

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.600
Ow!

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.700
He didn't have much
of a vocabulary

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.760
until... I would say
he was probably

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.430
three and a half
years old.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.030
Yeah.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.530
And then he started
picking up

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:32.960
on different words

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.500
and we knew what he meant,
because he lived with us,

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.830
but anybody
outside family,

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.360
did not know
what he was saying.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.060
WOMAN:
What does it look like, hmm?

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.960
Do I look really big
or really small?

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.960
Uh-huh.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.400
Small?

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.400
NARRATOR:
Michael's difficulties
with words

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.400
have nothing to do
with his intelligence.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.960
Good, okay, if you
turn them around 
see what happens.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.600
NARRATOR:
In her laboratory
at the University of Oregon,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.860
neuroscientist Helen Neville

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.200
is trying to understand
what has gone wrong.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.760
Orange tennis ball.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.430
Yeah, I like
that one a lot, too.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:12.530
(<i> woman's voice over speaker</i> ):
I like to sandwiches
eat for lunch.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.960
NARRATOR:
While Michael is distracted
by a puppet show,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.030
electrodes in the bonnet
he wears

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.400
pick up electrical pulses
generated by his brain

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.200
as he listens to sentences
laced with grammatical errors.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:33.200
WOMAN (<i> over speaker</i> ):
Big kids like to Coke
drink from a can.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.760
We're eavesdropping
on communication

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.860
and at the language system
of the brain itself.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:42.630
WOMAN (<i> over speaker</i> ):
 Like to make cookies
with chocolate chips.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.000
NARRATOR:
Neville is studying
the connections

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.460
between speaking, listening,
and understanding,

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.260
closely linked parts of the
brain's complex language system.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.330
NEVILLE:
It's very important to take
a language-impaired child

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.360
and evaluate what's deficient
and what isn't.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.560
WOMAN (<i> over speaker</i> ):
The backyard...

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.230
Language depends
on so many different systems

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.860
and structures in the brain,

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.200
that a problem
within any one of those systems

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.860
could lead
to a final common problem,

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.500
that is, of language impairment.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.930
Great!

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:18.660
All of them down!

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.500
Let's take a look
at what we've got.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.630
Jump.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.930
Jumped... oh, wait,

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.430
I want to hear
"jumped."

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.430
Jumped.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.600
Perfect, perfect.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.430
NARRATOR:
While scientists
are still searching

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:31.860
to understand why the brain

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.160
sometimes fails to process
language successfully...

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.160
Card.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.000
Crawled.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.300
NARRATOR:
with practice, children
like Michael can improve.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.500
(<i> listening to exercises
 over headphones</i> )

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.700
WOMAN:
Michael still has difficulty
producing sounds accurately.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.560
Wick.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.560
Licked.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.560
Wick.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.660
Yeah, that's close.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.000
For example the "L" sound,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.660
he doesn't have the "L" sound.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.260
He will work later
on sounds like the "R's,"

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.500
and the "V" sounds
and the "T-H" sounds.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.600
He's improved dramatically.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.760
So many of the early
developing sounds

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.260
that he didn't have when he was
initially seen are now there.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.260
FATHER:
Nut.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.260
MICHAEL:
Nut.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.830
Very good.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:16.860
Eight.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:17.960
Eight.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.330
Make sure you
put that "T" on.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:20.330
Pizza.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.630
They got cheese...

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.630
Hot.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:23.630
Hot.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.300
Hot, okay...

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.400
NARRATOR:
Through repetition and practice,

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.960
Michael is becoming fluent
in the spoken language

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.960
that is his birthright
as a human being.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.300
Rat.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.330
Rat.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.330
Rat.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:37.830
Okay, good job...

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.300
NARRATOR:
He is shaping his own brain,

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.130
changing it
with every syllable and sound.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.130
Gate.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.960
Gate, good job.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.360
MOTHER:
He's excited
to expand his vocabulary

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.600
and to learn how to say words.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.960
When you pet a dog, pat.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.160
Pat.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.560
Pat the dog.
(<i> laughing</i> )

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.800
Sometimes you can't
shut him up,

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.430
but, uh, he's...
he's coming along.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.700
Every week there's
a difference
in his speech.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.100
It's getting better
and better.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.800
NEVILLE:
The human brain
is highly adaptable,

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.960
and the young human brain

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:22.800
shows even a greater ability
to change than older brains.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.330
By studying Michael
and others like him

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.260
we're getting
a very basic understanding

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.230
of how a system of neurons
in the brain

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.200
could give rise
to human language,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.360
this marvelous skill which is
without limits, without limits.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:48.360
We can generate new sentences
that you've never heard before,

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.260
ad infinitum,
and you can understand them,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.230
even though you've
never heard them before.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.700
So how is that possible?

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:59.730
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep...

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.200
NARRATOR:
There are thousands
of human languages,

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.660
and babies are born with the
capacity to learn any of them.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.900
(<i> electronic voice
 repeating "sheep"</i> )

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.760
They begin by listening--

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.760
a baby sorts through
a babble of sounds

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.530
with more keen an ear

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:18.660
than a conductor rehearsing
a symphony orchestra.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.900
NARRATOR:
At the University of Washington,

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.760
neuroscientist Pat Kuhl
has been studying

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.030
the building blocks
of language--

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.860
the vowels and consonants
that make up words.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.600
KUHL:
In this particular experiment,
we're looking

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.300
at how children respond to the
sounds of their native language

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.400
and the sounds
of a foreign language.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.000
COMPUTER VOICE:
<i> Shi... shi...</i>

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.500
KUHL:
We're recording what's happening
to the brain

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.930
as the baby's listening
to the Chinese Mandarin "shi..."

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.360
COMPUTER VOICE:
<i> Shi... shi... shi...</i>

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.500
KUHL:
and then what happens
to the brain

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.160
when that sound is changed

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.560
to this Chinese Mandarin
"t-chi" sound.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.460
COMPUTER VOICE:
<i> T-chi... t-chi... t-chi...</i>

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.030
Of course, to us they sound
like "she, she,"

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.630
they sound like the same thing.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.030
But we're interested

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.930
in whether or not the baby's
brain records a change

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.000
when a physical change
in the sounds is made.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.100
COMPUTER VOICE:
<i> T-chi... t-chi...</i>

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.400
KUHL:
As Americans, we cannot hear
the distinction.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.400
It really sounds like
the same category-- S-H.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.560
COMPUTER VOICE:
<i> T-chi... t-chi...</i>

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.830
To the Chinese, they say,

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.830
"No, no-- there's
a very clear shift."

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.800
COMPUTER VOICE:
<i> T-chi... t-chi...</i>

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.360
And the interesting thing that
the studies have demonstrated

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.160
is that at birth and for
a short period thereafter,

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.960
babies have this
incredibly exquisite ability

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.430
to hear differences

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.530
between all the sounds
used in the world's languages.

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:49.730
The babies are outperforming us.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.030
I like to refer to them

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.260
as "citizens of the world"
in the beginning.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.430
And of course, we're
<i> not</i> citizens of the world.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.060
We're quite
culture-bound listeners.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.660
COMPUTER VOICE:
<i> Shi... shi...</i>

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:05.060
NARRATOR:
At seven months, babies are
still citizens of the world,

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.230
but by the time they reach
11 months,

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.330
they are citizens
of a single country,

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.730
specialists in one language.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:14.600
COMPUTER VOICE:
<i> Shi... shi...</i>

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.330
NARRATOR:
By 11 months, the babies are
behaving like their parents.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.760
This baby is not responding
to the change

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.030
between "shi" and "t-chi".

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.730
It's now "she, she" to the baby

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.030
just like it is for us
as adults.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:36.100
The news is that by 11 months,
we are not perceiving reality.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.500
We're not responding

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.830
to the real differences
that exist in the sounds.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.160
We're listening
through this filter

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.330
that was developed early in life

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:49.130
as we mapped the sounds of
our language during listening.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.560
Bah.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.360
Bah.
Bah.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.300
KUHL:
The baby starts out with a keen
ability to hear distinctions.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.330
Ready?

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:58.660
Should we do
it again?

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.700
KUHL:
The feat of development is

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.960
to actually form categories

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.730
and ignore some
of those distinctions...

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.260
WOMAN:
There goes
the train.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.430
KUHL:
The ones that are great
for a foreign language

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.600
but not for the language
you're trying to master.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.030
Three!

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.100
Three!

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.500
Three?!

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.530
KUHL:
And that ability has produced
a brain

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.200
that's a very,
very different one

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.530
than we saw
just four months earlier.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:27.060
NARRATOR:
As a child grows into an adult,

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.030
the brain becomes
more and more complex,

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:35.230
an intricate modular organ of
many highly specialized parts.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.200
In nearly all adults,

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.100
language finds its home
in the left cerebral hemisphere.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.030
Vocabulary, grammar,
comprehension

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:50.500
are different language systems
with their own neural circuitry.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:56.260
NEVILLE:
We have very little
understanding about how

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.800
this highly differentiated
mosaic comes about.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.660
How did it get to be that way?

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.130
That's what we want to know.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:05.860
Is it there at birth?

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.500
Does it develop over time?

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.600
What's driving the development?

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.260
Is it based in our genes?

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.030
Or does it depend on experience?

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.860
What we're going
to be doing today

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.730
is measuring
the brain's response

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.360
to words that she understands

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.230
from the list
that you filled out

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.560
and we'll be recording

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.760
over the different areas
of the brain, so we'll see

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.200
where there's
more activity

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.860
and where
that happens
in the brain.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.530
NARRATOR:
How specialized is
a baby's brain?

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:36.860
What part of the brain does
a baby use to understand words?

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.360
COMPUTER VOICE:
Pint.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.660
Unit.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.060
Dog.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.030
NARRATOR:
In a series of experiments

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.400
at the University of California,
San Diego,

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.500
developmental psychologist
Debbie Mills has found

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.060
that 13-month-old babies listen
and understand

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.000
with both cerebral hemispheres.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.830
COMPUTER VOICE:
Banana.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.230
Ball.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:01.630
Duck.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.930
But by 20 months,

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.400
at a time when babies
have been learning

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.360
as many as a dozen words a day,

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.530
increasing the size of their
vocabulary dramatically,

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.900
the language center of the brain
has begun to shift

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.430
to the left hemisphere.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.360
COMPUTER VOICE:
Milk.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.200
WOMAN:
<i> ¿Dónde están los pies?</i>

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.800
<i>iMuy bien!</i>

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.100
<i>¿Dónde está la mano?</i>

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.700
<i>iMuy bien!</i>

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.800
NARRATOR:
What is driving
this specialization of language?

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.360
Is it an inevitable
biological process,

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.260
a product of the child's
maturing brain?

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.900
<i>¿Dónde está el agua?</i>

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.700
<i>iMuy bien!</i>

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.900
NARRATOR:
Or is it a result

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.000
of a child's increasing
experience with words?

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.630
Where's the diaper?

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.200
Good job!

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.030
NARRATOR:
Children who understand
more than one language

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.330
are helping scientists answer
these questions.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:56.660
<i>iMuy bien!</i>

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.200
<i>¿Dónde está la leche?</i>

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.200
(<i> gasps</i> )

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.700
<i>Leche.</i>

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.400
(<i> laughing</i> ):
<i> Sí, mamá también tiene leche.</i>

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.800
NARRATOR:
Arielle Algaze is almost two.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.830
She's still nursing.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:10.500
(<i> women laughing</i> )

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.260
NARRATOR:
Because her parents speak
English and Spanish,

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.860
she understands both languages.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.160
<i>¿Dónde está el gato?</i>

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.860
<i>iMuy bien!</i>

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.660
NARRATOR:
But she knows many more Spanish
words than English ones,

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.260
which makes Arielle a perfect
subject for Mills' experiment.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.430
COMPUTER VOICE:
Baby.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.960
<i>Jugo.</i>

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.960
Bubble.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.630
NARRATOR:
If age alone is driving
brain specialization,

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.960
then by two,
both English and Spanish

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.960
should have begun to shift
into Arielle's left hemisphere.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.760
COMPUTER VOICE:
<i> Plantain.</i>

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.860
NARRATOR:
But if increasing vocabulary
size is driving specialization,

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.660
then Arielle's left hemisphere
will respond to Spanish words,

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.130
while English will provoke
a response

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:57.800
everywhere in her brain.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.360
COMPUTER VOICE:
<i> Borde.</i>

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.930
Compute.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.360
<i>Agua.</i>

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.260
NARRATOR:
In fact, Mills and her
research team have found

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.900
that in children like Arielle,

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.400
the brain has begun
to specialize

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.900
in response to Spanish--
the language they know best.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.530
COMPUTER VOICE:
Cookie.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.700
NARRATOR:
English words provoke
a more diffuse response

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.300
all across the brain.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.200
MILLS:
That really suggests that it is
experience with language

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.930
that's driving
these specializations.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:27.000
It can't be maturation

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.360
because it's in the same child

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.560
and in the same brain.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.230
The startling,
astonishing revelation

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.260
that has occurred
over the past few years

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.730
is that experience
is a major player

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.760
in driving the development
and differentiation

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.760
of the brain.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:53.260
NARRATOR:
If language takes its place
in the left hemisphere,

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.930
what happens when the left
hemisphere is compromised

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:58.430
by injury or disease?

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.060
For most of her life,

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:10.500
eight-year-old Katie Warrick has
suffered seizures so devastating

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.100
that today she can no longer
even talk.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.760
After agonizing discussions
with doctors

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.130
at Johns Hopkins Hospital
in Baltimore,

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:22.530
her parents have made up
their minds.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.760
Katie's doctors
have advised them

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.500
that their little girl has

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.500
just one hope of living
like other children...

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.230
Kiss Daddy.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.660
(<i> kisses</i> )

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.500
We'll see you.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.200
NARRATOR:
strike at the seizures

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.460
by eliminating the place in
the brain where they are found--

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.500
the left hemisphere.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.200
Katie is going to have

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.430
nearly half her brain
surgically removed.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.360
WOMAN:
When they tell you that,
all's you hear is the risk.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.760
Four years ago, we said,

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.260
"I'm sorry, but we're not
even going to consider that.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.900
"That's not even
an option for us.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.460
"We're going to exhaust
all our possibilities
with drugs

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.230
before we can even think
about that."

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:10.960
Well, four years later,
we did.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.030
There is no more drugs
out there for her.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.400
She's been on them all.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.900
NARRATOR:
The operation will take
six hours.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.260
If it succeeds,
her seizures will stop,

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.530
and Katie might even
learn to talk again.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.160
KATIE'S MOM:
I just have to keep
telling myself

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.900
"The outcome is going
to be worth it.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.660
The outcome is going
to be worth it."

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.760
(<i> screeches</i> )

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.700
(<i> laughing</i> )

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.460
MAN:
Stay out
of the deep end.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:05.830
NARRATOR:
It was seven years ago
that 14-year-old Michael Rehbein

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.460
had the left part
of his brain removed.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.460
Watch this, Mom.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:11.800
Ready? One more time.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:21.000
NARRATOR:
Every two years, he joins other
children like him for a reunion.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:34.360
They are a small band--
children who have struggled back

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.400
from an operation that has cured
their seizures,

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.500
but robbed them
of part of their brain,

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.300
leaving them with
half their body paralyzed.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.430
(<i> water splashes</i> )

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:44.430
Whoa!

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:46.160
MAN:
Nice flip!

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.760
MAN:
He had to learn to walk again,
learned how to talk again.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.860
With feet first!

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.200
You know, it was...

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.260
It was just like being
an infant again, too.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.300
He had to start
from scratch.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.660
He knew his ABCs and he could
count backwards from ten.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.830
He had to learn all that
all over again.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.160
So it was pretty hard.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.300
It was an uphill battle.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.530
Yeah.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:12.860
It still is today.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.830
There's things today
that he has to learn

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:15.830
every day of his life.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.230
You doing okay?

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:18.630
Yeah.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.800
I'll tell you
what we're going
to start with doing.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.260
I'm going to say
two words.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.630
I want you to
listen to them
really closely

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.860
and tell me whether
they're the same word

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.800
or whether they're
different words.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.730
Are you ready?

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.400
Pat, bat.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.800
Different.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.460
Fit, feet.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:39.860
Different.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.600
NARRATOR:
At Johns Hopkins Hospital,

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.630
neuroscientist Dana Boatman has
been testing Michael Rehbein

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:49.530
ever since his left hemisphere
was removed, part of her study

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:52.900
of how children learn to
understand spoken language.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.400
Same.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.830
BOATMAN:
One of the surprising findings
of our study

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:03.030
is that when we test Michael's
abilities to understand speech

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.600
independent of his ability
to speak,

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.900
he performs within normal limits
for his age.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.700
...tick.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.130
Different.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.830
The right hemisphere seems to do
every bit as good a job

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:19.360
at understanding spoken speech
as the left hemisphere.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.200
And it suggests to us

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:26.000
that those abilities are
not just in the left hemisphere,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.230
but that they're represented in
both hemispheres of the brain.

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:31.100
BOATMAN:
Ready to wear
some headphones?

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.630
Are you going to stay
awake for this?

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.630
I thought you got
a nap today.

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:37.630
Oh, I did.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.400
Oh, so you need
another one?

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.960
(<i> chuckles</i> )

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.560
BOATMAN:
It seems that there is
much more plasticity there

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.700
than we had originally
anticipated.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:51.530
INTERVIEWER:
How do you account
for the fact

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.600
that you can do
all these things?

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.260
Try my best.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.260
Persistence.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.630
Persistence is the key.

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.360
Determination.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.400
You do seem
like a really
hard worker.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.500
I watched you
doing those
tests.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.600
Are those tough?

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.460
A little bit.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:15.330
Some easy,
some hard.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:16.860
INTERVIEWER:
What's the
hard part?

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.160
Is it
remembering?

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.230
No-- speak.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.500
Speech is the most
difficult thing

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.500
for a left-hemisphere patient
to overcome,

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.960
'cause you lose your
speech center on that side.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.260
Memory's good.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.760
He can remember
anything.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.400
I love math.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.660
(<i> chuckles</i> )

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.830
INTERVIEWER:
But speaking?

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:45.760
Hard--
a little bit.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.360
NARRATOR:
Every Saturday
all through the summer,

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.760
Michael races mini-stock cars
at the Tri-County Speedway

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.060
near his home
in upstate New York.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.060
INTERVIEWER:
You flipped over once,
didn't you?

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.660
MICHAEL'S MOM:
More than once.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.330
How many times
did you go over?

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:17.600
Twice.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.600
My... got scared
half to death.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.700
(<i> laughing</i> )

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.460
I closed my eyes.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.400
(<i> laughing</i> )

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.360
INTERVIEWER:
You must've closed
your eyes, too.

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:31.330
Oh, my heart was
in my throat.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.100
INTERVIEWER:
We saw you holding your own

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:41.760
and then we saw
the car break down.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.800
What happened?

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.330
MICHAEL:
That spark plug.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:47.100
KEITH:
Broke a spark plug.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.530
That's all it was.

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:52.330
CRYSTAL:
And Daddy didn't have one
in his pocket.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.730
INTERVIEWER:
How did that feel?

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:56.260
MICHAEL:
Really sad.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.900
You hate it
when the little things

00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.300
let you down,
don't you, bud?

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.660
Mm-hmm.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:15.060
INTERVIEWER:
What was Michael like
before the surgery?

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.730
Do you remember?

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.130
Climb a tree.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:19.860
Yep, very
athletic.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.500
You were at Tastee-Freez
one night, remember?

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.660
Mm-hmm.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.500
And you looked around,
couldn't find Mike.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:35.530
He was up
on the pole.

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:37.060
(<i> laughs</i> )

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.730
CRYSTAL:
And then the seizures hit.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.830
NARRATOR:
When local doctors
could not tell the Rehbeins

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.160
what was wrong,

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.460
they took Michael to Johns
Hopkins Hospital.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.500
KEITH:
I think that they knew what it
was before we ever got there...

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.130
CRYSTAL:
Yeah, just by
looking at him.

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:02.600
KEITH:
Just from
the descriptions.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:07.130
And then they just
kind of dropped it on us.

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:08.560
It took a lot of decision,

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.300
a lot of soul-searching
to do it.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.500
Yep.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.260
When... a day when
he had a good day

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.000
when he might have 50
or 60 or 70 seizures

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.900
you... you kind of
had to sit there and go,

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.400
"Do we really want
to do this to him?"

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.000
You know, "Is it something
that's going to benefit him?"

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.530
CRYSTAL:
Then the next day
was 300.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:28.230
And then the next day he may
have 300, 400 seizures, and then

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.560
it was like, no, there's no
doubt in your mind today.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.300
Finally, you know,
it got to the point

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.330
where it got so bad that...

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.860
TOGETHER:
We had to do something.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.130
And then on the day
we sent him into surgery

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:42.060
he didn't have
any seizures that day.

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:52.000
BOATMAN:
I began testing Michael

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.660
as early as the first week
after he had surgery.

00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:00.260
And despite the fact that he
was largely mute at that time

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.500
he was showing an intact ability

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.500
to... to hear and
to process spoken speech.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:09.700
That suggests to us that these
children may have the abilities

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.760
already in place in the right
hemisphere to acquire language

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:18.160
and they can then build on those
abilities and develop language.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:26.800
By six months after surgery

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.360
Michael's speech-understanding
abilities

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.100
were back to what they were
before surgery.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.630
At that point, he was producing

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:39.500
one-, two-word utterances
spontaneously.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.760
Very slowly, the ability
to produce words

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.760
comes back over the course
of a couple of years.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:57.660
(<i> dog barking</i> )

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:04.030
The extent to which they're able
to produce fluent speech

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:06.030
seems to vary
from child to child.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.200
WOMAN:
I got Michael
in my class about...

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.700
I think it was seven months
after the operation

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.030
and he was not using
full sentences.

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:20.260
He was only speaking
in two- or three-word phrases

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:23.400
and doing lots of gesturing.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.100
We worked hard trying
to get Michael

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.360
to increase his vocabulary;
to speak sentences.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.860
I remember
the first full sentence

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.260
that he... that he told me;
that he gave us.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:36.230
He said to me,
"I love you with all my heart."

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.800
BOATMAN:
Michael.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.200
MICHAEL (<i> over intercom</i> ):
Yeah.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.200
Are you awake?

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.060
Yeah.

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.830
Are you going to be taking
a nap in there?

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:47.960
No.
Good.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.530
(<i> staff laughs</i> )

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:52.260
NARRATOR:
By scanning the brains
of children like Michael

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.260
who have lost
their left hemispheres,

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:55.860
Dana Boatman is trying to learn

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.630
how the brain's language systems
have been reorganized.

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.600
BOATMAN:
Are you ready to start working?

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.130
MICHAEL (<i> over intercom</i> ):
Yeah.

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:03.560
You'll hear
those sounds now.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.000
I want you to decide
if they're the same
or different--

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.760
if they're the same,
you're going to press
the button.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.060
Do you remember that part?

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.100
MICHAEL:
Yeah.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.730
(<i> machine plays

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:17.530
(<i> scanner beeping</i> )

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:19.060
(<i> machine plays
 two similar tones</i> )

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.830
NARRATOR:
We know that
the right hemisphere

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.260
is supporting language recovery.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:25.260
We're now starting
to try and identify

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.360
the exact areas
in the right hemisphere

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.130
that are being recruited.

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.400
(<i> scanner beeping</i> )

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.200
Is it the same area
that the child used

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.600
in the left hemisphere?

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.300
(<i> machine plays
 two similar tones</i> )

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.200
Or is it a different area?

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.930
(<i> machine plays
 two dissimilar tones</i> )

00:34:40.930 --> 00:34:43.700
Do they need more of the right
hemisphere to support language

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.830
than they may have
needed previously

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:47.230
in the left hemisphere?

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.630
NARRATOR:
Boatman's preliminary findings

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:52.760
show that areas
in the right hemisphere

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.260
that take on the job
of understanding language

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.230
correspond to the language areas
in the left hemisphere.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:03.160
But the right hemisphere
is not as efficient as the left.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.960
Michael needs more
of his right hemisphere

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.030
to understand the spoken word

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:10.360
than a child
with both hemispheres.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.560
BOATMAN:
We have children as old now
as 16 years of age

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.700
who have had left
hemispherectomies

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.430
who are able to recover

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:20.360
the ability to understand
spoken speech

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.630
every bit as well as they did
before surgery

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.860
and... as do normal children.

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:29.800
So this suggests that
we need to revise our notion

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.860
of an age limit on when
these surgeries can be done

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.000
and take into consideration

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.330
the fact that different
language functions

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.100
may be affected differently
by age.

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.530
(<i> crash</i> )

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:45.960
KEITH:
All right.
There you are.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.960
That's the shot.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.400
Right in there.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:55.330
KEITH:
He's still the same boy inside
that he was before the surgery.

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:56.400
KEITH:
Might sail.

(<i> exasperated groan</i> )

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:03.960
KEITH:
He didn't lose his drive
or his determination.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:08.260
He'll just keep trying
and trying and trying.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:10.460
Ooh.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:10.960
You get it?

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:11.500
Hit it!

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.160

I was going to say...

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:20.130
KEITH:
We've learned to rely
on each other a great deal.

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:22.500
We're a very
close family,
aren't we, bud?

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.930
Yeah.

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:26.130
In a way, this kind of stole
some of his childhood.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.130
Yes.

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:28.930
And it stole it from us, too,

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:31.100
because you know,
the years that...

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.060
when he's in first,
second grade

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.730
those are pretty precious.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:37.060
I mean, they're still
precious years that we had

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.160
but they were pretty
frustrating, too.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.600
Yeah.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.360
But we couldn't ask
for a nicer boy now.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.430
Mmm.

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:50.860
(<i> children laughing</i> )

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.700

There's the laugh.

(<i> all laughing</i> )

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.230
NARRATOR:
In the plasticity
of the child's brain

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:01.400
there is continual reason
for hope.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.360
You want more push?

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.100
(<i> Katie grunts</i> )

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.130
NARRATOR:
Six months after her
left hemisphere was removed

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:11.300
Katie Warrick is no longer
suffering relentless firestorms

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.700
in her brain.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.360
While the years of seizures
have left their mark

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.130
Katie's right hemisphere
is adapting

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:21.330
to its new responsibilities.

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:24.730
JANE:
It's just a joy to hear her
excited about something.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:26.700
She wakes up happy.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.860
She's really in tune
to what's going on around her.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.200
She's a whole lot more aware.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.330
(<i> exclaims</i> )

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:35.630
You got to reach it.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:36.630
Yay!

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:38.030
It's... it's like
an awakening.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:40.400
I... I told Robert it's like
having a different child.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.730
We have to learn to get
to know her all over again.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:44.930
(<i> giggling</i> )

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:47.360
(<i> groans humorously</i> )

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.600
NARRATOR:
Katie's language
is beginning to come back.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.630
Her understanding has improved,

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:55.000
and she is showing signs
of talking.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Uh-oh.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.230
Oh, you don't want
that ball.

(<i> garbled</i> ):
Yeah.

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.700
JANE:
There's sounds and noises
starting to come out of her...

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.730
(<i> grunts purposefully</i> )

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:05.730
In her own little way,

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:07.100
in her own
little language

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.830
just like a baby does,
you know--

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:11.360
how they... when they
first start to say words,

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.660
they're not very clear,

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.460
but you kind of get the message
of what they want.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.800
Eyes.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.500
Ears.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:21.860
Nose. Yay!

FATHER:
Every couple of weeks
or something

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.160
we'll see something different.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.560
Feel like you're so close,
you know.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.660
It's just like tomorrow,

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:31.030
she's going
to come up and say,

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.830
"Hi, Mom and Dad,
what's for breakfast?"

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:34.100
It's just that close.

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.300
You can just see her...
see her forming the words

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.030
and trying
to get them out.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.530
But I imagine it's
a little tougher,

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:44.360
you know,
with the damage
and stuff, so...

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.860
But we're looking
forward to it.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.700
Yeah.

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:58.300
WOMAN:
"There was once a prince who
wanted to marry a princess.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:05.330
"But she had to be
a<i> real</i> princess.

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:09.700
"The prince looked and looked,
and he met many princesses.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.530
"But the prince sent
all of them away.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:16.630
One day, there
was a big storm..."

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.160
NARRATOR:
For most of us

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.400
speaking is as natural
and inevitable as walking.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.630
TEACHER:
"'Come in,' said the king.

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:26.260
'Come in,' said the queen."

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.900
NARRATOR:
Reading is a high wire
balancing act,

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.430
a performance by the brain

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:32.900
that demands
the sophisticated coordination

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.160
of many of its parts.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.230
TEACHER:
"There's a lump in my bed."

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:42.000
WOMAN:
Reading never just happens.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.200
Reading is an example
of one of the most complex

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:50.200
everyday human cognitive
performances we have.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.600
"And she went off
to make the bed."

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.300
If we're novice, or young,

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.930
it happens in a certain way
in the brain.

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:01.830
If we're older, automatic
processes are being used

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:04.100
in other parts of the brain.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.660
If we're... we're reading
Chinese characters,

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.960
one aspect of our brain
is being used.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.560
If we're reading an alphabet,

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.930
another aspect of our brain
is being used.

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:20.530
WOLF:
"Once, long ago,
in a dark, lonely place,

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:24.730
"where the light of the sun
was never to be seen,

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:27.330
"there lived an elfin creature

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:31.300
"with hollow cheeks
and waxen complexion.

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.460
"Across the valley,
in a place where the sun

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.860
"played on every leaf and flower

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:40.100
"lived a maiden with cheeks
like rose petals,

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.100
and hair like golden silk."

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:47.630
Well... think syntax,
think vocabulary,

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:50.060
think words that
you never, ever hear

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.360
in oral discourse
around the table.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.730
The child has to learn

00:40:54.730 --> 00:41:00.630
to put all these hundreds
of concepts together to read.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:05.660
"Tab is a cat."

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.830
BOY:
Correct.

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:10.060
"Tab has a pal."

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.160
"Tab is..."

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.300
NARRATOR:
For some children,
reading comes easily.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:19.000
"Mack is a bad pal."

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.500
BOY:
"P... Pat has the ham."

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:29.030
"Pat ha... hi..."

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:31.030
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Check.

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:35.760
"Ha... had the pan."

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.730
NARRATOR:
For others, it is a struggle

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:40.900
that has nothing to do with
their powers to think or reason.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.260
"Pat had the ham."

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:44.260
Nice job.

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:45.660
Want to try it
one more time?

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:47.730
WOMAN:
In order to be able to read

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:50.600
we have to understand
what the correspondence is

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.860
between the sounds
that make up words

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:56.600
and the visual information
that we provide in letters.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.400
And so what happens is...

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.230
For example,
compared to language,

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:02.360
which children acquire
quite naturally,

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.330
reading has to be
explicitly taught.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:05.760
All right. Are you ready?

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:06.760
Quick as you can.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:10.930
CLASS:
Mmm.

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:12.600
How about this one?

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.660
(<i> class making short "A" sound</i> )

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:15.800
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

TEACHER:
Oh, my, you've got it.

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:19.930
WOLF:
Reading is many different kinds
of behaviors--

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:21.060
it's letter naming...

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:24.460
(<i> making growling "R" sound</i> )

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.500
WOLF:
It's letter perception.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.500
We got to make sure
we know which letter it is.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.700
The stick is first.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:33.030
(<i> kids sounding letter "B"</i> )

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:35.000
Ship...

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.600
Slip...

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.000
WOLF:
It's word perception...

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.260
Spin.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:45.830
It's recognizing words,
it's comprehension.

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.160
(<i> reading quietly</i> )

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.830
And all those behaviors

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:53.230
will utilize different parts
of the brain

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:56.300
whether we're talking
about a single letter

00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:00.200
or whether we're talking about
reading a passage of Proust.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.630
"The pan is hot.

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:04.460
Put the..."

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:08.560
NARRATOR:
To read, the brain must cobble
together a variety of parts

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.660
that evolved for other purposes.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:15.100
Vision, hearing, judgment,
memory all come into play

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:18.200
in a rapid-fire,
overlapping process

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:22.830
that scientists are only
just beginning to understand.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:25.660
EDEN:
We are looking at a...
a very, um, unusual skill

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:27.160
that we have learned

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.700
and the question is, "When
we learn a skill like that,

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.300
"where do we place it
in the brain?

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.200
"What part of the brain
becomes available

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.730
to do this very specific skill?"

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:44.600
NARRATOR:
For a child just learning
to read, even a single letter

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.530
will set off a complex series
of reactions.

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:53.300
The brain begins
by focusing its attention

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.900
on the reading task itself.

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:59.530
Then it captures a visual
representation of the letter

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:02.130
and sends it to the areas
of the brain

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:04.630
where the visual symbol
gets hooked up

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:06.960
to the letter's sound
and meaning.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.730
Trap...

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:11.130
Trap.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:14.900
NARRATOR:
Finally the letter
is articulated.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.260
"Sand... Skid..."

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:17.860
WOLF:
It's incredible.

how was that going
for you?

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.930
Hmm, okay, because they were
mostly like words this big.

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:27.960
And how about as
you got older

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.860
and started to try
to learn

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.300

What was that like?

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:35.530
Oh, it was getting
a little harder for me

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:37.560
because the words
were getting bigger

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.600
and the reading was getting
a little more complicated

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:41.860
and stuff.

Scientists have demonstrated

that the brains
of some dyslexic children

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:44.660
are not active in areas
responsible for dissecting words

into their constituent sounds.

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.830
EDEN:
Children who have dyslexia

00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:51.260
really never understand
the concept

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:54.500
that one word may be made up
of several sounds.

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:57.660
For example, in the word "cat,"
the sounds are "ca," "ah," "t"

00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:59.400
and we just blend
them all together

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.500
and when we grow up speaking,
we just say them as one sound

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:05.100
and that's all we need to do
to convey the meaning.

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.230
But now when we have to map
that sound onto print,

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:09.730
we have to understand that there
are actually three sounds

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:10.960
that make up the word "cat."

it makes your mouth smile.

when we have several children
who have done the same thing.

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.900
That gives us a...
a much better view

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.530
on, you know, what's
really going on

00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:18.060
rather than just
saying something

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:19.530
about one child
or two children.

00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:20.700
Right, right.

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:28.100
NARRATOR:
It will be several years
before Eden completes her study,

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.830
but while she
and other scientists wait

00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:32.330
to understand how,

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:36.430
dyslexic children continue
to remodel their own brains.

00:52:55.930 --> 00:53:00.760
WOLF:
Childhood can be one of the most
wonderful periods of all of life

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:04.200
because we have everything
to discover.

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:13.830
The child is father of the man,
mother of the woman.

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:21.400
I think the brain must be having
a great time as a child

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:23.500
because it's all plastic.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.560
And if there's any one word

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:29.060
for development and learning
it's "plasticity."

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:32.530
And plasticity,
I believe, can be lifelong.

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:43.030

MAN:
I spent 19 years
with the same personality

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:07.060
and, all of a sudden,
it was taken away.
