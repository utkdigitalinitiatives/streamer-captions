>> The judge told me, "I will
give your son 25 to life, so

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.800
you'd better take the plea.
Or if you don't take the plea,
he's getting it."
>><i> More than 95% of felony</i>

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.300
<i>convictions are the result of a</i>
<i>guilty plea.</i>
>> I was willing to plea guilty
even though I wasn't, because I

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:42.200
had to go home to my kids.
>> He said, "We want to drop the
murder charge on you if you'll
plead guilty to robbery."

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.260
And I said, "But I haven't
robbed anybody."
>><i> Tonight,</i> Frontline<i> tells the</i>
<i>stories of ordinary people</i>

00:01:48.260 --> 00:02:12.400
<i>caught up in a nightmare.</i>
>> All he has to say is one word
and he gets to go home:
"Guilty."

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.830
>> How do you plea to that
reduced charge?
>> Guilty.
>> Are you pleading guilty

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.200
because you<i> are</i> guilty, and for
no other reason?
>> Yes, sir.
>> Would you tell the court,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.260
please, why you were late
arriving at that meeting, Mr.
Cummings?
>> NARRATOR: Every few hours,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.200
every day, all across the
country, new and old television
shows demonstrate justice at
work.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:42.400
(<i> Law & Order</i> theme song
playing<i> )</i>
Americans love trials.
Everyone knows the rules.

Mr. Cummings?
>> The Honorable Mark Burns
presiding.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.260
>> NARRATOR: The judge.
>> I show you this weapon,
Lieutenant Drumm.
>> NARRATOR: Evidence.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.660
>> How much are you being paid
for today's court appearance?
>> NARRATOR: Expert witnesses.
>> $3,000.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.630
>> Objection.
This is irrelevant.
>> NARRATOR: Attorneys.
>> I don't see the relevance.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.430
>> I do.
>> NARRATOR: Prosecutors.
>> No more questions.
>> NARRATOR: The defendant, the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:14.700
jury.
>> We find the defendant guilty.
>> Not guilty.
>> We're deadlocked.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.600
>> The public perception of our
criminal justice system is
deeply shaped by television, and
that perception is that jury

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:29.400
trials routinely occur as a way
of deciding whether somebody is
guilty or innocent of the
offense of which he or she is

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.030
suspected or accused.
>> Any student in a civics class
in elementary school or junior
high school will learn about a

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.360
system with a trial by jury and
a right to counsel and proof
beyond a reasonable doubt, and
it won't remotely resemble the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.930
system that we have.
>> When your name is called,
please stand and announce that
you are here.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.530
Kevin Washington.
Thank you.
Rosemary Gonzalez.
>> Please have a seat.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.500
>> Thank you.
>> Pablo Hertado.
Thank you.
Mr. Martinez, how do you plead,

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.400
Sir, to assault on a family
member as alleged in cause
number 955015.
Guilty or not guilty?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.660
>> Guilty.
>> Are you pleading guilty ...
>> Are you pleading guilty
because you are guilty and for

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.430
no other reason?
>> Yes, I am.
>> Are you guilty or not guilty?
>> Guilty.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.700
>> How do you plead that reduced
charge?
>> Guilty.
>> NARRATOR: The sixth amendment

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.900
of the constitution guarantees
every citizen the right to be
judged by a jury of his or her
peers.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.800
>> Do you want to give up those
guaranteed rights and proceed to
plead guilty today?
>> NARRATOR: Yet about 95% of

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:40.530
all people who are convicted of
felonies across the country give
up that right and plead guilty.
>> ...that in exchange for a

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.130
plea of guilty, the State has
recommended...
>> NARRATOR: Most of these
guilty pleas involve bargains in

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.900
which the accused pleads guilty
in exchange for a lesser
sentence or a reduced charge.
>> How do you plead to

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.260
aggravated robbery alleged to
have occurred...
>> The system would collapse.
If every case that was filed in

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:05.600
the criminal justice system were
to be set for trial, the system
would just entirely collapse.
>> A lot of people call it a

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:13.500
necessary evil.
I look at it as a necessary
component in our criminal
justice system.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.430
But you have to understand that
a plea bargaining only works if
you have experienced, competent
defense attorneys, experienced,

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:27.830
competent prosecutors, and a
judge who will oversee and make
sure this is done... done
correctly.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.160
>> How do you plead that reduced
charge?
>> NARRATOR: But what if one or
more of them, these key legal

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:41.400
figures, are not as competent as
they should be?
What happens then to the plea
bargains which are now so much a

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:51.600
part of the system?
Tonight we will tell several
stories.
Different people, different

00:05:51.600 --> 00:06:13.300
charges, different parts of the
country, all with one thing in
common: the difficult dilemma of
confronting a plea.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:22.560
On November 2, 2000, in Hearne,
a small town in East Texas, Erma
Faye Stewart, then 30 years old,
a single mother of two, was

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:29.530
arrested.
>> The officer just come up to
me and said, "Erma Stewart?"
I said, "Yeah?"

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.130
And he just, you know, say, "You
under arrest."
And, you know, he, you know, he
told me to turn around and he

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:41.600
put the handcuffs on me.
And I asked him for what, and
you know, he just never did say
nothing.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:48.260
He just put me in the car.
>> Go down to this one, right
here.
Go down there.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:54.630
>> NARRATOR: Regina Kelly, a
waitress, 24 at the time, and a
single mother of four, was also
arrested.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:02.200
>> I was at work.
The police officers came in and
asked for Regina Kelly.
I said, "That's me."

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:09.400
And he said, "Ma'am, we have to
take you into custody."
I was like, "Oh, my god."
I knew I had tickets and I

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.130
just... I told my manager, I
said, "I'm going to jail because
I have tickets that I haven't
paid for.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:19.700
I just haven't paid my traffic
tickets."
And the police officer told me,
"It's not the tickets."

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:25.800
And that was it.
>> NARRATOR: The cases were
prosecuted by the district
attorney of Robertson county,

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.130
John Paschall.
>> I'll tell you what, I'm going
to write this down, I'm going to
put it down with the offer I

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:35.030
made to you.
And you get back to me next week
and I'll do the paper work up.
Okay?

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.430
Thank you.
Bye.
>> The case began with our
narcotics task force that

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:44.530
operated in this county.
It conducted an undercover
operation.
And they made the cases.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:49.160
And once they made the cases and
turned them over to the district
attorney's office, those cases
were then presented to a grand

00:07:49.160 --> 00:08:01.160
jury.
And the grand jury returned
indictments in those particular
cases.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:07.700
>> NARRATOR: It was part of a
big drug sweep based on a
confidential informant who would
later be proven unreliable.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:15.860
He implicated 25 men and two
women with felony drug
distribution charges.
Many lived in this public

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:24.360
housing project.
All but one were black.
They claimed they were innocent.
They were thrown into jail with

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:32.430
bond set as high as $70,000
each.
Regina and Erma Faye shared a
cell with two other women.

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:40.260
Neither had been in jail before.
>> It was hard.
It was a cell for two people, so
me and the other girl had to

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:46.230
sleep on the floor.
It's concrete, it's hard, it's
cold.
What made it bad was because you

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:54.130
are in there and there is
nothing you can do about it, and
you are in there for something
you didn't do.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:09:02.130
And it was hard just wondering
what's going to happen next.
>> NARRATOR: They put their
faith in their court-appointed

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:08.060
lawyers.
>> Our lawyers, that's really
all you have to just help you.
They went to school for this,

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:14.900
they know what to do.
But it didn't happen like that.
Like, when we all went to court
and got our court-appointed

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:20.300
lawyers, I wanted to talk to
him, sit down and talk to him
and say, "Hey, this is the type
of person I am, you know.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:25.930
You can look at my background,
you can ask people in the
community."
Just... you know, I wanted him

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:31.700
to know about me so he could
have a better sense in how to
represent me, you know, what
type of person I am.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:37.730
He didn't want to hear it.
He didn't have time, you know.
It didn't matter.
It was always an excuse

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:46.430
somewhere.
>> NARRATOR: Erma Faye did not
fare much better.
>> I had asked my lawyer, you

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:53.230
know, "What they going to do
about that, you know?"
You know, he had told me that I
was looking at ten years prison

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.730
term.
I had told him, I'm like, "For
what?
I hadn't did nothing."

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:05.900
>> But I want everyone in church
to get into the service.
>> Oh, yeah.
>> My lawyer came to me and

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:13.000
suggested ten years probation.
And like I told him I wasn't
going to take this if I did not
do this.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.500
I didn't do this.
"They have no evidence, no
nothing.
Everything is screwed up and you

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:24.630
still want me to plea out with
them," and I wasn't going to do
it.
Later on, he came back with five

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:32.100
years probation.
The D.A. went from ten years to
five years.
And I told him the exact same

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:41.700
thing, and he kept urging me and
encouraging me to take it,
because if I went to trial then
I would be faced with five-to-

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:48.700
99.
>> He was, like, pushing me to
take the probation.
He wasn't on my side at all.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:57.960
He wasn't trying to hear me.
He wasn't trying to explain
nothing to me.
And I even had told him, you

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:05.030
know, my understanding, you
know, is not that good so, you
know, you just really are going
to have to break it down to me,

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:13.630
for me, to understand.
>> INTERVIEWER: He didn't?
>> No.
>> Her name, Erma Faye Stewart?

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:18.460
I don't believe that I
represented an Erma Faye
Stewart.
I have to double check my

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:27.830
records on that.
>> NARRATOR: Bruno Shimek, Erma
Faye's court-appointed lawyer
whose name was on her plea

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:34.430
agreement did not remember her,
nor could he find any record
confirming that he ever
represented her.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:42.060
>> I don't have a file on her,
you know, went through and
looked at all those.
And she's not a person that, you

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:47.130
know... Robin Stewart I
represented, Aaron Stewart, Eric
Stewart.
I've checked all those, but not

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:56.330
Erma.
>> NARRATOR: Steve Bright is a
defense attorney, professor of
law both at Yale and Harvard,

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:02.830
and the director of the Southern
Center For Human Rights in
Atlanta.
>> Well, it is not unusual for

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:09.930
lawyers who handle a high volume
of cases to not know their
client's names.
I go to courtrooms all the time

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:15.330
where you see the defense
lawyers coming in and they will
stand up in the front of the
courtroom and call the names of

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:21.100
their clients because they don't
know who the clients are, and
ask them to raise their hand.
>> When your name is called, if

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:28.800
you do not have an attorney and
you wish to have an attorney
appointed because you cannot
afford one, if you will please

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:36.800
so indicate we will see that you
get an attorney appointed.
Mr. Schere, would you stand?
This is Mr. John Schere, he's

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:42.760
the public defender for Crisp
County.
I'm going to stand aside and
give the public defender and the

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:48.560
attorneys an opportunity...
>> The public believes that
every criminal defendant has a
right to the effective

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:58.530
assistance of counsel.
That is just so far out of touch
with reality, it's hard to even
begin describing it.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:06.100
>> It doesn't matter that the
lawyer may be conscientious.
Just the system makes it
impossible for that lawyer to...

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:12.000
to do his or her job.
>> Nicholas Octavius Johnson.
>> People may be not guilty,
people may be guilty of some

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.030
less serious behavior then what
they're accused of.
Many of the people that come
into the court system are

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:28.530
mentally ill, may have been put
up to it by somebody else.
The lawyer won't know any of
that.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:35.630
>> I do not contend that our
jails are stuffed with people
who pleaded to things that they
didn't do.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:41.400
I think most people who are
prosecuted of serious crimes are
guilty of at least what they're
charged with, and ought to have

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:47.760
serious criminal sanctions
attached.
But the problem is that "most"
isn't the way we do business in

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:57.960
a free society that cares about
individual rights and individual
liberty.
>> Happens every day in every

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:04.000
courtroom in the United States.
People come into arraignment,
they meet their attorney, they
have a brief conversation,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.930
they're informed of the charges,
they're informed of what they
could plead guilty to, possibly
to get out of jail that night,

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:17.130
possibly not; they have to make
a decision.
That's the truth.
Less interesting story than the

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:29.930
one that "Law & Order" tells
people, but that's the truth.
>> NARRATOR: Three weeks after
her arrest, Regina's parents

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:39.600
managed to have her bond reduced
from $70,000 to $10,000, and she
went home to await trial.
Erma Faye stayed behind.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:47.130
>> When she heard me on the
phone saying, "I'm going home,"
it was over with.
From that point on, it was, I

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:56.200
mean, it was downhill because
she was going to be by herself.
>> NARRATOR: Erma Faye then
offered to plead guilty.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:01.700
>> Even though I wasn't guilty,
I was willing to plead guilty
because I had to go home to my
kids.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:09.900
My son was sick.
And I asked him, "Listen now,
you know... you know, I can
plead for five-year probation,

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:17.330
you know, just... just let me go
home to my kid."
>> NARRATOR: The district
attorney, Erma Faye says, did

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:24.160
not agree to five years
probation.
He demanded ten years.
>> I had signed the paper, he

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:33.860
had took me back in front of the
judge, he had told the judge
that I took the ten years.
And, you know, they took me back

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:43.630
to my cell... after that, they
took me back to my cell, and an
hour later they had released me.
>> NARRATOR: Of the 27 people

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:50.760
arrested, seven pled guilty and
most of them got out on
probation.
A few posted bond and the rest

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:59.360
stayed in jail.
>> One reason that a lot of
people plead guilty is because
they're told that they can go

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:04.430
home that day, because they will
get probation.
What they usually don't take
into account is that they're

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:10.060
being set up to fail.
>> ...as soon as you serve five
years in state penitentiary.
I'm going to allow you to serve

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:15.100
that sentence on probation with
credit for the three months that
you've already served...
>> NARRATOR: There are about

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:20.800
four million people on probation
across the United States,
offenders who live in the
community under supervision.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.660
>> ...pay a fine as to each
count...
>> NARRATOR: Among their
obligations, they often have to

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:32.500
pay fines, court charges,
probation fees and for different
treatment programs that they
must attend, all of which

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:39.900
constitutes a sizeable source of
revenue for local governments.
>> ...also impose a fine in the
amount of $1,000 plus costs and

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.900
surcharge, and also order that
you...
>> Many of these people are
poor, they're destitute.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.560
They have no money at all, and
yet they are going to be told to
pay a fine.
They are going to be told to pay

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:55.060
a fee to a probation officer
every month.
>> Have a seat, talk to your
probation officer.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:01.800
>> I mean, all sorts of
consequences that are going to
flow, and perhaps the one that's
least understood is that the

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:09.100
failure to meet these payments
and meet the conditions of
probation is going to bring that
person right back into court,

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:18.030
and they are going to face
probably more time in prison
than they did originally because
now they are going to be

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:23.600
punished for violating their
probation.
>> There's a lot of harsh
consequences: you may not be

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:29.060
eligible for public housing;
you may lose the right to vote;
you may not be able to get
certain employment.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:34.100
If you're an immigrant, you may
be deported.
So it's no great shakes to get a
conviction and probation.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:41.960
>> Well, it's a punishment, but
it certainly beats going to the
penitentiary.
>> NARRATOR: Michael Wells is

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:48.460
not so sure.
When he was arrested in the drug
sweep in Hearne, he had been
serving the last four months of

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:55.860
a prior ten-year probation for a
drug-related crime to which he
had admitted guilt.
>> When I first got put on

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.860
probation, I told the judge I
was going to complete it.
And he said, "When you complete
it, I'm going to shake your

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:04.300
hand."
I was looking forward to that
day.
Let him know, "Hey, I did ten

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:10.400
years probation."
So it is people out there that
make mistakes and they correct
it, you know, themselves by

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:18.330
doing.
And when they came up with the
drug bust, it was like, "Oh,
this is a bunch of... this stuff

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:23.030
sucks."
This whole system... probation
sucks.
I'd never take it again, you

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:32.130
know.
>> NARRATOR: Recently, Michael
fell behind in his probation
fees, and was hiding from the

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:38.360
probation officers.
>> I don't got the money.
I get harassed every time I go
in there.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:45.730
"You need to pay this here."
I was going faithfully before
then, but now since I ain't got
no money and I'm just at a

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:52.130
struggling point right now.
So therefore, I don't want to
look in their faces and hear
their criticism of, "Come up

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:58.630
with this money."
Because every time you go in
there, that's how it goes on.
>> The courts are sort of like

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:04.400
finance companies now.
They are trying to collect all
this money from people.
And, of course, the people don't

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.900
have any.
I mean, this is like trying to
get blood out of a turnip.
I mean, we're talking about the

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:15.130
poorest people in our society
who are really barely surviving.
And so they can't pay, so the
probation officer renegotiates

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:20.330
with them.
And sometimes they even go back
to court and extend the
probation.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:25.960
And so there are always paying.
And it really is very much like
a high-interest loan.
I mean, it's like you can never

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:35.060
get it paid off.
>> NARRATOR: Those indicted in
the drug sweep who refused to
take a plea and couldn't afford

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:48.200
bond spent five months in prison
awaiting trial.
The first trial opened in the
Robertson County courthouse on

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:55.460
February 19, 2001.
It soon became clear that the
evidence was worthless, and that
the confidential informant had

00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:04.560
lied to the prosecution.
>> The informant that was used
by the law enforcement was not
credible in his testimony.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:16.860
And if someone is not credible
to me, then I cannot see putting
that person on the witness stand
and trying a case.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:24.160
So we dismissed... I dismissed
the cases.
>> NARRATOR: Within a few weeks,
all the cases, except those who

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:31.730
had pled guilty, were dismissed.
But the neighborhood remained
wary.
>> Even though it was thrown

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:37.600
out, they're still not saying
you're not guilty.
The D.A done went in the
newspaper and said even though

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:43.200
the cases were thrown out,
dismissed, they still are
guilty.
You know, he's still telling

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:49.360
people we're guilty.
>> I believe every one of them
was guilty.
But I don't believe the state

00:20:49.360 --> 00:21:00.860
had enough evidence to convict
them beyond a reasonable doubt.
>> It was hard.
My children... my oldest

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:07.500
daughter, she felt like I lied
to her.
Children in school making fun of
her, "Your mom's a dope dealer,"

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:17.560
you know.
Oh, you big girl.
I want a formal apology.
The same way, you know, that you

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:23.060
put it out there to the world
that I am guilty of this crime,
I want you to put it out there
to let them know that you made a

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:33.130
mistake.
>> NARRATOR: No apology would
help Erma Faye.
Three years after she pled

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:40.230
guilty in order to go home and
take care of her children, she
was destitute.
Because of the plea, she's

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:47.930
ineligible for both food stamps
for herself and federal grant
money for education.
She cannot vote until two years

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:54.630
after she completes her ten-year
probation.
And she has been evicted from
her public housing for not

00:21:54.630 --> 00:22:03.700
paying rent.
Her children sleep in various
homes, and she is homeless.
She spends her nights outside

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:11.500
the housing project waiting for
the morning when she can go to
her work as a cook.
Her job pays her $5.75 cents an

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:18.560
hour.
>> I honestly don't believe she
really understood the full
extent of everything.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.430
She's a single mother, I'm a
single mother.
There is no way we can live
without help from the

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:29.960
government.
We need that help, you know, and
you can't get that... you cannot
get that if you plea out to

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:36.160
this.
>> You know, my people, they
weren't looking out for my kids,
you know, like I look out for

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:44.030
theirs.
>> You don't deserve this.
You really don't.
You don't deserve this.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:48.900
If I would have stayed, I
wouldn't have let her plea out
for anything.
I know I would have made her

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:54.830
stay right there with me.
Please don't cry.
You gotta be strong.
You've got to.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:23:05.660
>> (<i> crying</i> ) I was just... I
don't know, I was just, you
know, just try to maintain, you
know, I don't know, just

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:17.300
sometimes... I am always
thinking of killing myself to
just get away from this.
>> INTERVIEWER: The pressures?

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:24.000
>> Don't do this to your kids.
They look at your face and they
know something's wrong.
Your oldest child, she know.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.260
She's old enough.
She know.
She can just look at you and
tell, "Mama, something not

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:37.830
right."
>> They saying I owe them
$1,866.
>> NARRATOR: She owes $1,000

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:43.500
fine, court costs, and late
probation fees.
>> They pressure me to pay this
money, which they know I don't

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:53.360
really have.
They see it like as long as I
have a job, you know, I can pay
good.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:24:00.960
How you gonna explain to them,
you know, "I'm having a hard
time, you know, I have to buy my
son a medicine."

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:06.600
I have to have his medicine for
his asthma.
They don't really care about
that.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:14.200
All they want is, you know, was
the money.
>> One of the corrupting
influences in our courts is that

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:25.200
many localities depend upon the
courts as a major source of
revenue; that the speeding
tickets and the driving while

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:30.600
under the influence of alcohol
tickets and the money for
marijuana possession.
And all of these crimes is to

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:36.130
generate money.
But when the courts are in
pursuit of profit, that's in
conflict with being in the

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:47.630
pursuit of justice.
>> NARRATOR: Erma Faye will be
under probation for at least
seven more years.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:56.230
The fact that her case would
have been dismissed with all the
others, had she not taken the
plea, makes no difference.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:25:00.900
>> It's very difficult once
you've pleaded guilty.
The guilty plea sort of puts a
lid on the box regardless of

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:08.430
what's inside the box.
It's a system that's designed to
keep the truth from coming out.
Plea bargaining has nothing to

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:14.330
do with justice.
It has to do with convenience,
expediency, making the life of
prosecutors and defense

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:25.730
attorneys easier and more
profitable.
It's designed to avoid finding
out the truth.

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:35.860
It's designed to avoid hearing
the defendant's story.
(<i> cars honk</i> )
>> NARRATOR: If that's true in

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:50.000
a small town in East Texas, it's
just as true in the big city.
Take the case of Charles Gampero
of Brooklyn, New York.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:26:00.160
On December 11, 1994, an
incident happened outside a
bowling alley.
A 33-year-old man was killed.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:07.960
His name was John Weingrad.
>> One of the detectives greeted
me and he said, "Your son took a
beating."

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:15.530
And I said, "How bad, how badly
was he beaten?"
And he said, "He died."
I said, "Oh, my God."

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:24.600
I said, "Are you crazy?"
>> NARRATOR: A 20-year-old man,
Charlie Gampero, was charged
with murder in the second

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:32.100
degree: murder with intent to
kill.
The defendant had no criminal
record, and the two did not know

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:48.360
each other.
Charlie's father, Charles
Gampero, Sr., was in the bar of
the bowling alley that night.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:53.630
>> Charlie told me he had a
fight.
I mean, when he came back into
the bowling alley, he was

00:26:53.630 --> 00:27:01.200
wearing beige.
He wasn't scuffed.
His clothes weren't messed.
It was like he had just walked

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:06.630
in, like he had just gotten
dressed, left the house, and
walked in.
>> NARRATOR: There was no

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:15.230
question that John Weingrad and
Charlie Gampero had a fight very
late at night outside the
bowling alley.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:20.760
What was in question was how did
the fight start?
And more importantly, how it
ended.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:26.860
The photographs the police took
of the dead man showed a badly
bruised face.
The defendant claimed he left

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:36.430
him unharmed.
According to Charlie Gampero, he
was trying to prevent a fight
outside the bowling alley, when

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:42.860
the victim turned around and
punched him.
He then punched him back and
kicked him, leaving him on the

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:49.360
ground but, he says, very much
alive.
>> My father came home later
that night and he had said that

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:54.030
the guy that I had a fight with
had passed away.
I couldn't believe it.
I says, "How?

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:58.860
What happened?"
So I had assumed that maybe
something happened afterwards, I
don't know, because I didn't

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:04.000
think that would have anything
to do with me.
I mean, he was sitting up when I
left.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.930
>> NARRATOR: The details were
murky.
There had been a fight at the
bar of the bowling alley between

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:19.200
John Weingrad and other people
early in the evening before the
defendant got there.
It quieted down, but left people

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:25.130
angry.
Was that a connection to the
killing?
There was something else.

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:33.260
The victim's car was found
outside the bowling alley
wrapped in toilet paper.
According to Joseph Weingrad,

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:39.700
the victim's father, this kind
of harassment had started
happening a few weeks before.
Was<i> this</i> connected to the

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:48.200
killing?
>> The only thing I could tell
you, I said, is that he was
subjected to a lot of harassment

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:58.800
beginning back around Halloween,
when he came home from a
Saturday night and his car was
covered with eggs.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:03.100
And I asked him, "John, what
happened?"
And he said, "I don't know, I
came out of the bowling alley

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:10.960
and these eggs were all over the
car."
He just assumed that it was just
kids.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:18.900
But see, the harassment
continued.
There were times when his car
was moved.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:28.100
As a matter of fact, my wife and
I actually sat one night-- John
parked his car three blocks away
on a Saturday night-- we sat up

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:39.530
here till about 1:00, 1:30 in
the morning, just sitting here
watching his car to see if
anybody would come along and try

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:50.530
to do anything to it, pick it up
or move it, or what have you.
But nothing happened that night.
And so we went home, and John

00:29:50.530 --> 00:30:02.900
came home, there was no problem.
And then the following week he
was killed.
>> NARRATOR: The prosecution's

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:10.030
theory of what happened was
completely different.
They believed, they told Mr.
Weingrad, that his son was

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:17.630
killed because of a phone call.
There was a phone call for
Charlie Gampero that night on
the pay phone at the bowling

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:26.160
alley.
It was his girlfriend looking
for him.
Someone answered it and

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:32.100
apparently spoke obscenely to
her.
The prosecution's theory was
that the person who answered the

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:40.100
phone was John Weingrad, and
that's why Charlie Gampero went
after him and killed him.
Charlie Gampero says that's not

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:47.630
true; that he was trying to
break up a fight.
But he never got to tell his
version of the story.

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:54.660
He has never been questioned by
the police, before or after his
arrest.
>> We went in for questioning in

00:30:54.660 --> 00:31:00.800
the morning.
When we got there we went to the
detectives' room and the
detective turned to my father,

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.930
"Are you Charlie, Sr.?"
He said, "Yes."
He turned to me, "Are you
Charlie, Jr.?"

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:08.660
I said, "Yes."
And he turned to the female
detective and said, "Okay, read
him his rights."

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:14.460
That was it.
>> In a matter of five minutes
that Charlie was there, my
husband called me to tell me,

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:25.160
"Get a lawyer, they arrested
Charlie."
>> NARRATOR: All the theories,
evidence and testimonies were to

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:33.460
be presented to a jury in a
Brooklyn criminal court in
November 1995.
>> Of course I wanted to go to

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:40.000
trial because murder is where
you intend to hurt somebody.
That wasn't my intention.
I didn't intend to hurt anybody.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:47.330
I wasn't there to get into any
type of fistfight.
I wasn't looking for trouble.
So I didn't understand how they

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:54.130
would have these major charges
against me?
>> I really thought that Charlie
probably would have went to a

00:31:54.130 --> 00:32:03.000
trial, you know, and he would
have been acquitted because, you
know, he didn't do it.
>> NARRATOR: Joanne, Charlie's

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:10.000
mother, is remarried and lives
in Florida.
>> Charlie came down with a
friend of his to tell me that

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.300
this had happened.
It was just a fight, you know.
They didn't think it wasn't too
serious at that time.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:21.300
Then my ex-husband called and
said, "We are going to court and
something will happen."
And that's when I flew in.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:27.800
And that was the first time that
I really realized what was
happening and how serious, and
so on and so forth.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:33.060
>> INTERVIEWER: Did anyone ever
discuss the possibility of a
plea bargain with you?
>> No, there was never a plea

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:40.130
bargain on the table to my
knowledge-- ever.
>> NARRATOR: But unbeknownst to
them, there was a plea bargain

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:45.360
on the table.
In fact, one had already been
negotiated between the
prosecutor and the victim's

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:53.360
father.
>> I would say probably within
two or three weeks prior to
going into court I was brought

00:32:53.360 --> 00:33:00.960
in by the district attorney, Mr.
Gliatta, to his bureau chief.
She sat there and she said to
me, "Mr. Weingrad, there are

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:10.030
some problems with this case.
And we feel we can win the case
in court.
But I just want you to know

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:21.600
there are some problems in the
case, and it might be advisable
to let him plead to a lesser
charge."

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:27.830
If I was thinking clearly, I'd
say, "What are the problems?"
But I wasn't thinking that
clearly at the time.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:34.200
>> NARRATOR: After discussing
various possibilities in the
D.A.'S office, they agreed upon
a manslaughter charge and a

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:41.200
sentence of seven to 21 years in
prison.
>> I said to the district
attorney and his boss, I said,

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:53.630
"If you can guarantee me that he
cannot get out of prison before
that seven-year term, that he
must spend that full seven

00:33:53.630 --> 00:34:02.200
years, I think I will agree then
to accepting a plea bargain."
And they said, "Oh, he'll spend
the whole seven years."

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:11.260
"As a matter of fact," he said,
or she said, rather, "Guarantee
you he'll do ten because he...
when they come up for parole,

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:20.260
they're never granted parole on
the first time around."
I said, "Okay."
And that was it.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:26.830
>> NARRATOR: Unaware of what had
transpired between the
prosecutor and the victim's
father, the Gampero family went

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:36.060
to court to meet the judge.
>> I mean, he scared me like
nobody has ever scared me in my
life.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:47.000
I... I... he tells us his name
is Frank Egitto, but they call
him "Maximum Frank."
>> NARRATOR: Judge Egitto, who

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.930
served on the bench for 30
years, is now retired and serves
as a judicial hearing officer.
>> I admit it.

00:34:53.930 --> 00:35:00.860
My sentences may be a little
more harsh than somebody else's.
But I have to do it according to
<i>my</i> conscience, not someone

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:06.330
else's conscience.
I have to be able to sleep
nights.
And I'll tell you this, I'm a

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:15.100
very peaceful sleeper.
>> NARRATOR: Looking at the
minutes of the case, Judge
Egitto remembered.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:21.400
>> Something happened as people
were exiting this particular
bar.
The defendant claims that the

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:31.630
deceased struck him.
The defendant responded, not
with a punch, but knocking the
deceased down, kicking and

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:39.130
punching him while he was on the
ground, stomping him while he
was on the ground.
They just went... in my opinion,

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:52.760
he just lost it.
And it was a mean, vicious
attack.
>> Now he's telling us if we go

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:57.930
to trial with this, he will give
my son the maximum of 25 to
life.
He doesn't want to know if he's

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:03.000
innocent.
We had started to pick the jury
already.
I think there were two jurors

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.560
picked, if I am not mistaken.
Then they came up with a plea
deal.
Naturally, we said that's crazy,

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:14.330
we didn't want a deal.
>> NARRATOR: The deal offered by
the prosecution was manslaughter
with eight-and-one-third to 25

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:22.930
years in prison, an offer higher
than the one agreed upon with
Mr. Weingrad, which was seven to
21.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:29.800
Then the judge intervened,
saying he would try to do better
than that.
>> So the judge goes out, comes

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:39.660
back and tells us, "All right, I
just was on the phone with my
boss"-- whoever that was-- "And
they're allowing me to offer you

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:48.030
seven to 21.
>> At that point, it was just
like I wasn't there, like, you
know, you're just in shock.

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:52.300
You just go through the motions,
you can't believe its happened
to you.
It doesn't seem real.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:37:01.100
>> I'm sick to my stomach,
because at that time I was 48,
and I said, "By the time my son
gets out, if he gets 25 to life,

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:11.060
he'll... he'll be my age.
They'll... forget about raising
a family, forget about
anything."

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:14.930
>> I didn't feel it was my
decision to make.
I just felt that they had to
decide.

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:20.930
It was going to effect my ex-
husband more than me.
And if I would have pushed to go
to trial and it didn't turn out,

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:28.530
he wouldn't have never forgiven
me.
>> He told me, point blank, told
me and my ex-wife, he said,

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:36.100
"If... I will give your son 25
to life, so you'd better take
the plea.
Or if you don't take the plea,

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:42.460
he's getting it."
>> NARRATOR: According to
Professor Green, these kinds of
threats are constitutional and

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:52.100
legal.
>> Some years ago, a defendant
argued to the Supreme Court it's
inherently coercive if the

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:58.660
prosecutor says to me, "You can
plead guilty and get three years
in jail.
Otherwise, you can go to trial

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:04.400
and have all your trial rights,
but if you're convicted, you
face 30 years in jail."
That sounds like coercion.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:10.700
And to you and me, and most
ordinary people, that sounds
pretty coercive.
But under the constitution

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:17.100
that's not considered coercive.
And so if you plead guilty
with... in order to avoid
infinitely harsher sentence,

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:27.100
that's considered a voluntary
plea.
>> NARRATOR: The Gampero family
was given the night to weigh

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:34.430
their options.
They had to decide whether to
insist on a trial knowing the
risk of a maximum sentence of 25

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:42.630
to life, or take the guilty plea
with its sentence of seven to 21
years in prison.
They wrestled deep into the

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:55.060
night.
Two decades before, Patsy Kelly
Jarrett was faced with the same
quandary.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:39:01.400
>> Being outside is just like a
fading memory.
It's been so long ago, so much
has changed.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:09.530
The whole world has changed
since I've been out there.
I've been in Bedford Hills since
1977.

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:17.860
I'm one of the longest-serving
inmates.
When you are in prison, you die
inside, you just die.

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:23.200
And what keeps you going is
people that love you and care
about you and that reach out to
you and say, "We love you, we

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:32.760
care about you."
>> NARRATOR: One of those who
reached out to her was law
professor Claudia Angelos.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:38.400
>> Kelly Jarrett and I are
exactly the same age, we are of
the same generation.
And anyone else who is of that

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:43.300
generation will, I think,
understand the social
circumstances in which she grew
up.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:48.500
This was in the early '70s that
she was a young woman, maybe 21,
22 years old.
She was pretty marginal.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:53.600
She's from North Carolina, kind
of a trailer girl, but a good
kid.
She had a car and she had a job

00:39:53.600 --> 00:40:02.130
and she had some friends.
>> NARRATOR: In 1973, 23-year-
old Kelly Jarrett took her first
trip out of North Carolina.

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:09.430
It was a trip that would change
her life forever.
>> She had a friend who
suggested, "Oh, let's just get

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:19.360
out of here for the summer."
So she and this friend, who was
a guy, drove up... up through
the South into the Northeast and

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:25.460
up to Utica, New York.
And they kind of landed there
for a few weeks.
Her friend did some day laboring

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:31.400
kind of work.
He used her car.
And she kind of hung out, played
softball, had a little summer

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:38.430
vacation.
Couple weeks later, they made
their way back to North Carolina
and resumed the lives they had

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:44.630
had.
>> About three years passed,
there was a knock on the door
and the police were there with a

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:51.730
warrant for my arrest for a
murder from Utica, New York.
And I was shocked.
I was really upset.

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:55.360
And you know, I called my
parents, you know.
I went down to the police
station.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:02.930
They came down and met me there.
I took a polygraph while I was
there, and I was locked up until
my parents obtained a counsel

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:10.800
and attorney for me, to help
represent me.
>> It turns out, and it's beyond
any doubt, that the guy she was

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:18.630
with while they were in Utica
robbed a gas station and
murdered the gas station
attendant.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:24.730
>> NARRATOR: It was the most
brutal murder ever seen in the
small town of Sherrill, near
Utica, New York.

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:34.060
17-year-old star athlete and
high school graduate Paul David
Hatch was bound, gagged, and
killed by a white young man

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:40.900
during an armed robbery of a gas
station.
It was clear that two people
were involved.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:47.700
According to the eyewitness
testimony of an elderly man, a
second person was outside in a
car.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:54.160
He wasn't sure if it was a man
or a woman.
>> There was no other evidence
against Kelly Jarrett at all.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:00.660
That was the evidence.
A man who had said, "I couldn't
see the face, I don't know if it
was a boy or a girl," two and a

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:06.830
half years later said it was
her.
That was the evidence.
There was nothing else

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:12.660
connecting her to that crime.
>> NARRATOR: She was tried
jointly with her co-defendant,
the man she was with that

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:22.260
summer, whose fingerprints were
found at the crime scene.
>> I learned in the courtroom
what happened-- how, when.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:27.460
It was just awful, you know, it
was just awful to be sitting
there and to be accused of
something like that.

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:33.030
It was just a horrible
experience.
>> NARRATOR: The evidence
against her friend was massive.

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:40.100
The evidence against Kelly
Jarrett was weak.
>> It was an extraordinarily
weak case: this very poor,

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:45.700
extremely unreliable
identification, and nothing
else.
So she was offered a plea of

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:56.660
five to 15 years if she would
plead to the robbery, not to
the... to the murder.
A plea of five to 15 years in

00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:02.160
those days meant that absent any
serious misbehavior a person
would be paroled at five years
without any question.

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:07.200
The system is different now, but
it certainly meant that then she
would... at that time, she would
have served five years.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:12.160
She had already been in jail
waiting for trial for certainly
over a year, as I recall.
So she would have served only

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:20.030
about four more years.
I know she was advised to think
seriously about that plea by her
lawyer.

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:24.330
>> I told my attorney, "You
know, I can't... I can't do
this."
And he said, "Well, you know, my

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:29.900
hands are tied."
He said, "We want to drop the
murder charge on you if you'll
plead guilty to robbery."

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:39.100
And I said, "But I haven't
robbed anybody."
>> The notion of pleading guilty
to something she absolutely

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:45.560
didn't do on the evidence of a
man who didn't even see the face
of the person who was there, was
ridiculous.

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:49.760
And I don't think she seriously
considered taking that plea for
a minute.
>> NARRATOR: She faced the jury

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:55.860
claiming that she had nothing to
do with either the robbery or
the murder.
>> I believed in the American

00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:03.800
system of justice.
I believed that you just tell
the truth and the judge and jury
will hear you and, you know,

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:15.760
nothing will happen to you.
But I was wrong.
And I got convicted and was... I
was sentenced to 25 to life.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:22.500
>> Innocent people are convicted
at trial.
So this happens at trial.
People who defend plea

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:29.200
bargaining will say, "Well,
sending people to trial doesn't
necessarily guarantee perfect
results."

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:36.460
But what the guilty-plea system
guarantees is that when you have
miscarriages of justice, the
victim of it is going to face

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:44.230
staggering sentences because
those sentences are not a
consequence of justice.
Those sentences are a

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:50.860
consequence of the need to
grease the wheels of the system.
So they become the example, they
become the grease, or they

00:44:50.860 --> 00:45:01.000
become the object lesson.
And what we see, the next time
around the prosecutors says,
"Well, you want to go to trial,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:14.460
that's your right, you can be
just like Mrs. So and So, and
look what happened to her."
>> NARRATOR: After a night of

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:21.360
soul searching, Charlie Gampero
came to the same conclusion that
Kelly Jarrett had.
He wanted a trial.

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:28.000
His parents were anxious.
>> Charlie had decided he was
not going to take it.
>> Charlie wanted to plead "not

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:35.330
guilty."
And I didn't say anything at
that time when he said, you
know, "I'm pleading not guilty

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:39.900
we're going to go to court with
this."
So I didn't say anything.
I was nervous.

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:45.100
>> And then the attorney said,
"Well, you know, this is a
Friday, and we do have a lot of
family out of town and would

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:52.860
like to have till Monday to
think about it and discuss it."
So he said, "No, no, no, if you
do that, the D.A. has got to

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:57.860
work all weekend getting their
witnesses together and, you
know, we can't do that and, you
know, put it off."

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:01.530
And it says in the minutes,
"Let's get this in and out," you
know.
He was in a hurry to, you know,

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:06.760
get it off the table and on.
>> INTERVIEWER: The Judge?
>> Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:14.800
>> My job was to expedite the
movement of cases.
My delaying this case delays the
next case, which delays the next

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:24.260
case.
If I went till Monday, and then
they decided not to take the
plea on Monday, I would have to

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:31.730
adjourn the case again for the
purpose of the D.A. making sure
they had all their witnesses.
>> I'm saying to myself, it's

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:37.160
been a year.
If the prosecution doesn't have
their case already ready, what's
the difference whether I tell

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:41.900
him I'm going to trial over the
weekend or not?
Were they going to get it ready
in two days?

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:50.960
>> And the judge said, "No,
you've got exactly 15 minutes.
You go outside, you talk to your
clients, and you're back in here

00:46:50.960 --> 00:47:03.000
in 15 minutes with the decision.
And I'm telling you now, if you
do not take the plea and I find,
or we find your client guilty,

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:11.960
he's going to get 25 to life.
And once the trial commences, I
will not entertain any pleas.
The trial will go through to its

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:24.230
conclusion.
And if he's guilty, 25 to life.
Go talk to your client."
>> So we are in the hall of the

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:31.400
courtroom, someone came out and
told us, "The judge would like
you to come inside, they're
bringing in another case for the

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:40.730
sentencing."
>> NARRATOR: The case was a
young man who had charges
similar to Charlie's.

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:46.600
>> So the kid came in, they
found him guilty, and he told
the kid, "I am sentencing you to
25 to life.

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:56.430
Now whether he did this to scare
us-- which he already had me
scared, so he... it made it
much, much worse.

00:47:56.430 --> 00:48:03.200
>> Anyway, I go out in the
hallway and it's me, my father
and my mother.
And they're telling me... I

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:07.800
think my mother had says, "You
know, if you get 25 to life, I
might not be alive when you come
home.

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:12.160
Who knows what could happen in
that many years?"
>> I had to walk away, and I
just walked away you know

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:19.900
hysterical crying by myself.
I mean, it was really... it was
very emotional, very, very, very
emotional.

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:30.130
Very sad.
>> We were crying like babies.
But that's all he wanted.
He wanted that decision then and

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:35.160
now, he didn't want to know
anything.
>> I'm saying to myself, well,
this is the judge that's going

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:39.360
to be handling the trial.
This guy is going to make the
decision.
If my lawyer objects something,

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:45.460
he's going to decide whether it
is going to upheld or sustained,
whatever.
You know, now I'm against

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:50.760
everybody.
Who's on my side here?
My lawyer was standing like on
the other side of the hallway,

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:55.330
and I was kind of looking at him
like, "Are you going to give me
any type of advice here?
Are you going to tell me

00:48:55.330 --> 00:49:00.360
anything, like should I do it,
shouldn't I do it?
You don't have to guarantee me
anything, but you know better

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:04.200
than me.
Explain something to me.
Tell me something."
>> INTERVIEWER: He didn't?

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:09.760
>> No.
>> I just don't think that he
was either... I don't say that
he wasn't prepared, but I don't

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:15.560
think it... maybe it was over
his head or he didn't know what
to do, and I don't think he had
a good solution to the problem.

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:21.560
>> He turned around and he said
to me, "Charlie," he says, "I'll
tell you the truth," he says,
"I don't even... I can't even

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:26.400
give you an answer."
Because I said, "What should I
do?"
He says, "I don't know."

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:31.560
He says, "I have a..."
He has a young son also."
He says, "I can't even tell you
what to do."

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:37.460
I mean, he felt for us.
He says, "I've never seen it
where they force you or put your
back against the wall like

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:44.830
this."
>> A lawyer who goes to trial
has a strong duty to investigate
the case, to interview

00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:52.060
witnesses, to look for defenses,
to prepare for cross
examination.
A lawyer who plans to plead

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:58.000
guilty can make a tactical
judgment that it's not worth his
time.
So in effect, the defendant not

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:07.460
only waives his right to a
public trial and all that that
entails, he also, in practice,
is waiving his right to legal

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:13.760
research and to thorough factual
investigation by his own lawyer.
>> NARRATOR: Charlie Gampero now
believes that his lawyer was not

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:21.560
prepared to go to trial.
And since he never previously
told the family about the plea,
he may have been just as

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:29.330
surprised by it as they were.
The lawyer refused to talk to
<i>Frontline</i> , or help in any way
with this documentary.

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:36.230
>> I guess at that point Charlie
felt that maybe it was a good
idea to take it.
Judge Egitto kept making us

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:42.400
think that he had this good deal
for us of seven to 21, you know,
there'd be programs, there'd be
this, he'd be out in seven

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:47.560
years, you know.
Yeah, we just passed the eight-
year mark.
>> We took the plea agreement

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:53.930
thinking that the judge knew
what he was talking about and my
son would be home by the time
he's 27.

00:50:53.930 --> 00:51:04.130
"27," I said, "Charlie, you
could still raise a family, you
could still have a good life."
It didn't work out.

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:10.900
>> It was just like, you know, I
just wanted to take it away from
them.
You know, why are they... why

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:14.930
does my family got to go through
this?
So it seemed like this is what
they wanted.

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:21.360
Not that they wanted me to go to
prison, but...
So I, you know, I decided, I
told my lawyer, "All right,

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:30.900
we're going to take the seven to
21."
And that was it.
>> Any of us will plead guilty

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:39.900
if the disparity between what
we're threatened with if we go
to trial and lose and what we
get if we don't is increased

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:51.860
enough.
>> NARRATOR: There is no greater
disparity than in a death
penalty case, when the choice is

00:51:51.860 --> 00:52:01.660
between a guilty plea with an
immediate release and a possible
execution.
In February 1999, an

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:11.360
unprecedented fourth capital
murder trial was about to begin
in Bastrop, Texas.
It had a 20-year-old history.

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:19.230
Three trials had already taken
place.
Prosecutors and defense
attorneys had come and gone.

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:29.760
A death sentence had been
imposed, reversed, re-imposed,
and then reversed again.
This was to be the end of the

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:40.000
road, the very last trial of
Kerry Max Cook.
Paul Nugent has been his defense
attorney since 1991.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.560
>> We're actually in the
courtroom for a pre-trial
hearing.
The district attorney's first

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:51.900
assistant comes to me and pulls
me aside and kind of stuns me,
says, "Will Kerry consider a
plea bargain?"

00:52:51.900 --> 00:53:00.460
It was shocking and surprising
because for 20 years all you had
heard from the district
attorney's office was this

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:06.800
vicious rhetoric that Kerry was
this heinous criminal who
deserved to be executed for the
rape and mutilation of this

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:12.960
young woman.
And all of a sudden, they are
offering him freedom.
All he has to say is one word

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:24.200
and he gets to go home: guilty.
>> NARRATOR: Kerry Max Cook was
arrested in August 1977 when he
was 21 years old.

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:34.230
Charged with a brutal murder and
rape of 21-year-old Linda Jo
Edwards in Tyler, Texas.
He was tried one year later.

00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:42.300
>> Kerry was a young kid, he was
a high school dropout, and his
biggest sin in East Texas in the
1970s was he was allegedly

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:47.800
homosexual.
It's a very religious community,
there.
It's a part of the American

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:57.530
Bible belt.
That was a major strike against
Kerry.
>> I can't tell you what that

00:53:57.530 --> 00:54:05.130
was like sitting at that defense
table and having the prosecution
raise his voice like in that
southern Baptist way with the

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:11.330
fire and the brimstone, and
pointing almost inches from my
nose and screaming, "It's time
to put all the freaks and the

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:17.360
murderous homosexuals on the
scrap heap of humanity where
they belong."
I mean, just screaming.

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:24.560
I'm sitting there like his
breath is blowing my hair back
out of my face.
>> NARRATOR: Convicted and

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:34.130
sentenced to death, he spent
years on death row, where he was
abused and raped.
He tried to commit suicide, and

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:43.500
was saved.
He then tried again by
mutilating himself.
He left a note: "I really was an

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:52.260
innocent man."
The prosecution did not see it
as a desperate act, but as a
confirmation of a disturbed

00:54:52.260 --> 00:55:02.530
killer.
He had spent 13 brutal years on
death row, when his sentence was
reversed based on a

00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:09.000
technicality.
That's when Paul Nugent became
his lawyer.
>> The issue is, has the state

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:15.900
proven their capital murder case
by proof beyond a reasonable
doubt?
>> NARRATOR: The new trial, with

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:24.130
a new district attorney, took
place in 1992, and resulted in a
hung jury.
The state then retried the case

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:30.200
once more.
>> ...to find this defendant
guilty of capital murder because
that is the crime he committed

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:37.300
on June 10, 1977.
>> NARRATOR: The death penalty
was reinstated.
Then once again in 1996, the

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:45.800
Texas court of criminal appeals
reversed the conviction.
It also published a scathing
critique of the conduct of both

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:54.830
the police and the prosecution
going back to the first trial in
1978.
They wrote that the

00:55:54.830 --> 00:56:04.630
investigation was intentionally
misleading, the key witness
Robert Hoehn's testimony was
"prejudicial," and the first

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:09.960
conviction was obtained through
fraud and in violation of the
law.
>> The highest criminal court of

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:16.160
Texas found substantial and
egregious and systematic
prosecutorial misconduct in
Kerry's case.

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:20.530
We're not talking about an
isolated act.
We're not talking about one
instance of police or

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:27.800
prosecutorial misconduct.
We're talking about systematic
misconduct.
>> NARRATOR: Even the then-new

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:34.700
first assistant D.A., the man
who fiercely prosecuted Cook in
the last two trials, David
Dobbs, agrees.

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:40.730
>> Let me make it real clear to
you, this prosecution of Kerry
Max Cook was mishandled from the
start.

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:46.330
There were problems.
And there's no question that
there were things that were done
that were unfair to him.

00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:52.830
I've never indicated anything
other than that.
>> NARRATOR: And yet that didn't
deter Dobbs from going on

00:56:52.830 --> 00:57:00.660
fighting to put Cook to death.
>> I'm completely 100% convinced
that Kerry Max Cook is guilty.
>> NARRATOR: He wanted to use

00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:06.900
the final chance of a fourth
trial to convict Cook.
But this time, he had to do it
without the testimony of his key

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:14.500
witness.
He was worried.
>> The Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals, which is the highest

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:22.460
court in Texas, had ruled that
we could not use the testimony
of the man that was with Mr.
Cook just prior to the

00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:31.600
commission of the offense, based
on prosecutorial misconduct that
had taken place in the '70s.
We... without that testimony, we

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:37.100
could not place Mr. Cook at the
crime scene the night that the
actual capital murder took
place.

00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:43.700
>> NARRATOR: The irony was that
the testimony of the witness,
Robert Hoehn, who had died in
the meantime, was the example

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:51.060
cited by the Texas court of
criminal appeals as prejudicial
and contradictory.
So what the prosecutor was

00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:59.200
saying was that if he couldn't
use the prior testimony, he
couldn't win the case.
>> If we could have read in his

00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:06.300
testimony, even though, as you
have pointed out there are some,
you know, there are some
problems with it-- like any

00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:10.200
other testimony, there's some
good with the bad-- if we could
have read in the testimony and
proved his proximity to the

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:15.830
crime scene, we would have gone
ahead and tried the case.
>> NARRATOR: He weighed his
options: he could go to trial

00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:23.600
with what he felt was a weak
case; he could try to get Cook
to take a guilty plea; or he
could dismiss the case.

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:34.530
>> We were not about to dismiss
the case, because he's guilty.
>> The prosecutor offered if
Kerry would plead guilty he'd

00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:39.030
get out, his case would be over
with.
He'd have to plead guilty to
time served.

00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:46.100
I went and talked to Kerry, and
Kerry looked me in the eye and
said, "I want to go home, I want
to be free, I want this behind

00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:56.230
me, but I will go back to death
row, I will let them strap me to
the gurney and put the poison in
my veins before I lie, before I

00:58:56.230 --> 00:59:02.260
plead guilty."
>> It's all I had left.
I was innocent.
They... after what they had done

00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:09.100
to me, and they'd convinced the
people of America that I was
this raping homosexual maniacal
murderer, alls I had left was my

00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:16.230
integrity, my honesty, and the
truth.
And the truth was that I did not
rape and kill Linda Jo Edwards,

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:21.730
and no one was going to say that
I did.
No one was going to make me
carry that burden.

00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:27.900
>> NARRATOR: What happens when
the defendant refuses to plead
guilty and the prosecutor is
afraid to lose the trial but

00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:36.030
will not dismiss the case?
There was one more possible
option.
The Supreme Court decided in

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:42.830
1970 that it does not violate
the constitution for a defendant
to make a deal and plead guilty,
while still maintaining his

00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:52.460
innocence.
Such a plea is called an Alford
plea, or a no-contest plea.
>> It is perfectly

00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:58.960
constitutional to accept a plea
of "guilty but not guilty."
That is, the defendant can say,
"I didn't do it, but I want to

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:05.360
take the deal."
And the Judge can say, "Okay,"
which means that it's not
necessary for an innocent person

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:10.600
to lie, to take the deal.
He can say he is innocent and
still take the deal.
>> The Supreme Court says you

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:21.300
can plead no contest, you can...
But most prosecutors will not
let a defendant enter a plea
of<i> nolo contendre</i> or "no

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:26.760
contest," the way Spiro Agnew
did.
Defendants are pretty much
required to either go to trial

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:38.600
or admit their guilt.
>> NARRATOR: This prosecutor
felt he had little choice.
He offered Kerry Max Cook the

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.660
no contest plea, which means
that Cook can maintain his
innocence while knowing that the
court has convicted him.

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:49.960
It's the only time it has ever
happened in a death penalty case
in Texas.
>> It's the hardest decision

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:59.060
we've ever had to make, but
unfortunately, we were faced
with the choice of doing
something that would ensure that

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:04.030
he was convicted of murder or
running a very, in my opinion,
substantial risk that without
the testimony of Bob Hoehn he

01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:11.430
would walk the streets free from
this.
>> They couldn't admit they had
made a mistake, they couldn't

01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:21.200
admit that perhaps the State of
Texas almost executed an
innocent man.
So, it was cover for them.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:27.330
It was political cover is what
the plea bargain was.
>> NARRATOR: Cook now had to
make his life-or-death decision.

01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:32.700
>> My lawyers told me it was my
decision.
Paul Nugent said, "We could win
it, Kerry.

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:37.230
I think you will be acquitted
this time."
I'd heard that before.
The truth had rung in my ears

01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:43.430
for so long I couldn't hear it
anymore.
I've given them 22 years.
I just didn't want to give them

01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:49.300
anymore.
Too much.
>> INTERVIEWER: So you took it.
>> I took it.

01:01:49.300 --> 01:02:02.360
And I regret it everyday.
>> NARRATOR: Then almost out of
the blue, two months after Kerry
Max Cook took the no contest

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:10.260
plea, and 22 years after the
murder, the result of a DNA
analysis of a semen stain found
on the victim's panties came

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:18.630
out.
It did not match Cook's.
The prosecution says that these
findings were not exculpatory,

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:30.330
and that Kerry Max Cook was, and
remains, guilty.
>> At a moment like this, just a
nightmare for me.

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:36.430
The state of Texas has executed
me over 1,000 times.
>> NARRATOR: Kerry Max Cook went
on to play himself in the play

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:41.600
"The Exonerated."
>> I get these nightmares.
Sometimes I forget I'm really
here.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:46.730
>> NARRATOR: Of the eight
characters on the stage, he is
the only one who is still a
convicted murderer.

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:50.900
>> We'll show the world once and
for all that he committed that
murder.
>> The idea that he is going

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:55.400
around the country in a play
that purports him to be
exonerated and innocent is very
distressing to me.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:01.030
But the important thing for us
was to insure that he got a
conviction for murder that would
follow him for the rest of his

01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:08.830
life.
>> 22 years.
>> NARRATOR: It does follow him.
Married with a young child, he

01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:17.730
says the state granted him his
freedom, but neither his dignity
nor his peace of mind.
>> The punishment never ended.

01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:24.900
Say one of my taillights goes
out, I'm unaware of it, and then
the police pull me over.
They run that license plate

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:29.130
and... First of all, they don't
get out of their car until
they've got two or three more
backups.

01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:33.300
I'm sitting there waiting,
looking in the rearview mirror
saying, "I know what's going on,
but I wonder how bad this is

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:38.030
going to be because I'm Kerry
Cook with a capital murder
conviction."
"So let's get out and spread

01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:42.400
'em."
Do you have any knives, have any
guns, have any drugs or, you
know, where were you at last

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:49.960
night?"
I don't have any rights left.
It's a very, very traumatic
ordeal.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:58.060
So, you know, was it worth it?
Sometimes when I'm holding my
son I can say yes.
Sometimes when I'm by myself I

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:14.060
say no.
They won.
>> NARRATOR: Ten years have
passed since Kelly Jarrett

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:21.360
rejected her plea bargain and
was sentenced to 25 to life.
Then she suddenly got another
chance at freedom when she met

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:31.160
Claudia Angelos.
In 1986, Claudia was a young law
professor at New York
University.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:37.130
>> I had a little program in
which some law students went to
the Bedford Hills Correctional
facility to teach inmates about

01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:44.300
the law.
And I had been doing this for a
couple of months when I got a
phone call from the warden, we

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:50.230
call them, the superintendent of
Bedford Hills, a man named Frank
Hedley, who said, "I wonder if
you can help me.

01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:58.330
I have someone in here I think
is innocent."
>> NARRATOR: Abbe Smith, now a
professor of law at Georgetown

01:04:58.330 --> 01:05:03.900
University, was one of the law
students at the time.
>> It was my second year in law
school, and I signed up to be

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:10.160
part of what was then called the
Prison Law Clinic.
There were a bunch of cases that
we could have worked on.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:17.400
And the teacher, Claudia
Angelos, basically sort of
presented all the cases, and she
described Kelly's case, and I

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:23.060
immediately said that's the one
I want to work on.
>> And we filed ultimately a
petition for<i> habeas corpus,</i>

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:33.760
it's called in the federal
court, challenging the validity
of the eyewitness identification
by the... by the old man.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.960
>> NARRATOR: To their surprise
and delight, the<i> habeas</i> was
granted.
Kelly Jarrett was to be released

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:44.460
or retried.
>> Claudia calls me up and she
says, "We won.
It's fantastic, we won."

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:50.260
And I said, "That's great."
And she said, "Not so fast.
You know, the state is going to
appeal it and the circuit court

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:56.330
is not going to be as good."
And in the meantime, Kelly's
offered a plea.
>> "If you'll take the plea,

01:05:56.330 --> 01:06:03.430
we'll give you time served,
essentially time served if
you'll just take this plea."
>> She asked me what I would do,

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:12.160
I told her I would take it.
She asked me what I thought she
should do.
I told her she should take it.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:19.660
She asked, "What if I don't?"
And I said, "I'll fight for you,
I'll keep fighting for you.
We'll do our best, but we might

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:25.300
lose."
She said, "Let me think about
it."
She said, "No, I'm not going to

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:30.200
do it, no, I'm not going to do
it."
I said, "Please think about it,
please talk to other people

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:36.660
about it.
I think you're making a mistake,
but it's your decision."
>> I told them I... in my heart

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:42.700
I just couldn't do it.
It was just... my conscience and
in my heart and it's just
morally wrong to say you did

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:48.360
something you know in your heart
you didn't do.
I couldn't live with myself if I
did that.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:56.330
I couldn't just... I just
couldn't live with myself.
I saw the pictures of the young
man and, you know, just... it

01:06:56.330 --> 01:07:02.360
was just for them to want me to
say that I did something so
horrible just to get out of
prison, I just couldn't do it.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:08.600
>> I understood that.
I understood it.
I thought it was foolish, but I
understood it.

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:15.960
I let her do it.
>> INTERVIEWER: She couldn't
convince you?
>> She tried, she really tried.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:21.160
She said, "You know, if you
don't take this plea you may
spend the rest of your life in
prison."

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:32.100
And I said, "I just can't do it.
I just can't do it."
>> She couldn't do it.
That God... she's a religious

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:40.060
woman, that God wouldn't let her
do it, that it would be wrong,
it would be lying, and that she
would rather stay where she was

01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:52.500
than commit fraud just to get
out.
And I accept... I accepted her
decision, and I left.

01:07:52.500 --> 01:08:03.000
>> NARRATOR: After Kelly Jarrett
refused the plea offer, the
State won the appeal and she
remained in prison to serve the

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:11.130
rest of her sentence, which may
be the rest of her life.
>> And I regret it every day of
my life, every day of my life.

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:16.230
I could have insisted, I think I
could have.
As I've often thought, I should
have reached across the table

01:08:16.230 --> 01:08:21.260
and grabbed her by the throat
and said, I'll quit, I won't
represent you.
You must do this, you have no

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:37.100
choice."
And these last... these last 20
years she'd have been with us,
instead of buried in there.

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:51.360
>> I love Abbe and Claudia, but
in my heart it's just not the
right thing for me to do.
>> Well, in the end of the day,

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:59.200
in this case, evidently the
client has certain values that
she places above liberty.
Now it's a sad thing, and what

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:08.130
occasions it is the conviction
of an innocent person.
But from the lawyer's
perspective, you have to respect

01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:13.060
the client's decision at the end
of day.
If she understands what the
stakes are and she knows her own

01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:22.800
values, she's entitled to say,
"I just won't say I'm guilty
because I'm not."
>> NARRATOR: Abbe Smith, who has

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:28.900
been Kelly Jarrett's attorney
for the last ten years, does not
see it that way.
>> I would have made her plead

01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:35.700
guilty.
I would have been relentless.
I would have brought her brother
up to Bedford Hills prison to

01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:41.260
put pressure on her to plead...
I would have brought her father,
who was aging and infirm, up
there to Bedford Hills prison.

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:47.100
If I had to drive down to North
Carolina myself and put them in
my car, I would have brought
them up to the prison and I

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:53.830
would have ganged up on her.
And I would have had them beg
her, and I would have had them
cry, and I would have had them

01:09:53.830 --> 01:10:00.300
say, "Please, you know, you only
have this one life."
I, you know, I would have had
her father say, "I don't want to

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:05.730
die when you're in prison.
And I would have said to Kelly,
"You know what, you can fight
for your good name outside the

01:10:05.730 --> 01:10:10.460
prison walls, but get out
first."
>> NARRATOR: Bruce Barket is a
defense lawyer in Long Island,

01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:16.560
New York.
>> I know what I would tell my
client.
"Out is out."

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:24.600
"Out is out.
"Get out.
Get out."
I mean, and I tell them that,

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:29.400
when they're confronted with
whether or not to plead guilty.
I don't' want to stand next to
somebody whose pleading guilty

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:37.760
to a crime they didn't commit.
But I don't want to be standing
next to somebody when they are
wrongfully convicted of a

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:46.030
charge... a crime they didn't
commit, and get much more time.
So I say... I mean, I am not shy
about trying cases, I am not shy

01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:51.300
about fighting the government,
but out is out.
>> There's a line that you can't
cross, and it's not clear where

01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:58.900
the line is.
But at some point what you're
doing stops being giving
information, stops being

01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:06.160
persuasion, and it starts
becoming coercive, and you're
not supposed to cross that line
if you're a lawyer.

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:10.230
>> You know, most of us don't
become criminal defense lawyers
cause we want to make innocent
people plead guilty.

01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:16.060
But the system stinks.
And here's somebody who had been
locked up for ten years in a
maximum security prison and

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:21.860
everybody knew that the Court of
Appeals was going to reverse.
There is this one moment, this
one opportunity to free her.

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:27.600
And I would have done everything
within my power to get her to
plead guilty.
>> That's like, say like you had

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:38.030
a daughter and she's carrying a
baby and she doesn't want to
have an abortion, but you're
forcing her to have one.

01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:44.500
I mean, I feel she should have
the choice not to do that.
And I feel that I should have
the choice for my own life not

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:50.360
to do something that I feel is
wrong.
>> Hers is an exceptional
reaction.

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:58.730
Most people do the obvious self-
serving thing, and that is they
buckle in those circumstances
and they bear false witness

01:11:58.730 --> 01:12:11.800
against themselves.
That's what plea bargaining asks
you to do: confess yourself
guilty.

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:19.360
>> NARRATOR: In Brooklyn, New
York, after Charlie Gampero took
the guilty plea, he learned that
he then had to confess to every

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:29.000
detail of the crime he had pled
to.
>> The judge wants me to say
what happened.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:39.630
He asked me what happened that
night.
So I told him that, you know,
when I went outside, um, he hit

01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:45.300
me, Mr. Weingrad hit me and I
hit him back.
When he fell on the floor, I
kicked him and I punched him.

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:52.730
He went crazy.
That was not what he wanted to
hear.
>> NARRATOR: Bruce Barket is

01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:58.660
Charlie's present lawyer.
>> The judge knew that
allocution, that statement by
Mr. Gampero didn't warrant a

01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:05.330
guilty plea.
It should go to trial if that's
the truth.
So the judge, "I want a guilty

01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:11.030
plea.
I know it has to be sufficient."
He says, "That's not right, you
got to tell me more."

01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:21.000
>> So he yells at my lawyer and
tells my lawyer, "Can you please
explain to Mr. Gampero that he
has to say what happened here,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:29.930
he has to be honest with what
happened here."
>> NARRATOR: Judge Egitto agreed
to go over the minutes.

01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:35.860
>> The court: I went out of my
way to try-- dash, dash-- I want
a candid statement of what
happened, what transpired.

01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:43.730
This man did not die from one
punch.
I saw the pictures."
>> My lawyer basically told me,

01:13:43.730 --> 01:13:47.830
"You have to agree with what he
says."
So now the judge tells me what
happened.

01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:51.730
>> The court: "Kicked him and
stomped him?"
The defendant: "I kicked him,
yes."

01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:57.100
"And you stomped him?"
"Yes."
"And by doing that you intended
to inflict serious physical

01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:02.630
injury to this person?"
"Yes."
>> "Yes, yes."
And I just kept yessing

01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:10.660
whatever... anything he said I
said yes to, "Yes, Sir," "Yes,
Sir," "Yes, sir."
>> "You weren't satisfied with

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:16.260
just knocking him down and
walking away, were you?"
Answer: "No."
"You wanted to make sure he

01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:22.200
didn't get up again."
"Right."
"Yes": the defendant.
>> So he basically went down and

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:29.360
said everything that happened.
I just yes and no'd it.
>> The court: "Is that plea
satisfactory?"

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:36.260
Ms. Block, the D.A.: "Yes, Your
Honor."
>> And he tells me off the
record, he says, "Make sure that

01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:41.130
when you go for the pre-sentence
report, make sure you tell them
the same thing."
And that was it.

01:14:41.130 --> 01:14:46.130
I walked out of the courtroom.
>> INTERVIEWER: You mean don't
change your story?
>> Yeah, basically.

01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:54.630
Not my story, don't change my
story.
Don't change his story.
It wasn't my story anymore.

01:14:54.630 --> 01:15:01.700
>> It's a coerced confession.
You can sort of satisfy your
conscience with this salve of "I
made him say he did it."

01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:07.860
And he's saying, "Well, okay,
you son of a bitch, if I got to
say I did it to take the deal,
I'll say it.

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:14.130
Do you feel better now?"
>> INTERVIEWER: Do you believe
that what the defendant was
saying when he was answering all

01:15:14.130 --> 01:15:23.700
your questions was the truth?
>> Do I believe it?
I have to, otherwise I couldn't
have... I would not have taken

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:33.800
the plea.
I would not have taken the plea.
>> INTERVIEWER: Because he
started by saying that he

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:38.860
punched him and kicked him once,
and you said, "No way."
>> But then he came around...
before I said anything else, he

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:45.030
came around to punching and
kicking him while he was on the
ground, and I added the word
"and stomping him?"

01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:51.130
And that's when he said, "Yes."
But I never put those words in
his mouth.
Right?

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:59.530
I only added the word
"stomping."
Those were his words, not mine.
He knows what he was indicted

01:15:59.530 --> 01:16:08.530
for, he knows what he did.
>> NARRATOR: Joseph Weingrad,
the victim's father, is not as
sure anymore.

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:16.230
A former investigator himself,
he began to have doubts about
the police investigation and the
sentence.

01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:24.830
>> If you don't go to trial and
you don't get this discovery,
and you don't get people getting
up there and putting their hands

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:31.760
on the bible and swearing to
tell the truth, you are not
going to find out what really
happened.

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:38.030
>> NARRATOR: He began his own
investigation.
He filed a civil suit against
the bowling alley, and combed

01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:46.100
through all the facts the
investigators discovered.
He came to believe, he said,
that the police investigation

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:53.230
was sloppy, that the so-called
witnesses were inconsistent, and
that no one saw his son take the
phone call.

01:16:53.230 --> 01:17:00.930
He felt that other people who
had harassed his son before had
to be involved, and that Charlie
Gampero, who punched and kicked

01:17:00.930 --> 01:17:11.330
John Weingrad, was probably not
the one who killed him.
He went to see the district
attorney.

01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:21.260
>> I just hit them straight on.
I said, "I am not faulting you
as a district attorney.
I believe that you did a

01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:30.330
terrific job in the courtroom.
You bluffed that defense
attorney."
I said, "Paul, you didn't stand

01:17:30.330 --> 01:17:37.860
a Chinaman's chance of
convicting Charles Gampero if
they went to trial."
As a matter of fact, if I had

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:46.930
been the attorney, I would have
blew you out of the water.
There's no way you could have
convicted him.

01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:54.230
I said, "But, you know, with
your list of so-called witnesses
and the judge telling Gampero's
lawyer you got 15 minutes to

01:17:54.230 --> 01:18:01.660
make a decision or else you're
going to trial, and if we go to
trial and you're found guilty
you're going to get 25 to life,

01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:08.100
and I won't entertain any pleas
once the trial commences, the
trial will go through to its
conclusion and he'll get 25 to

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:16.030
life if he's guilty."
Scared the hell out of everybody
on that side, and they caved in.
>> NARRATOR: He left the

01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:22.660
district attorney's office, he
said, "Unsatisfied."
>> INTERVIEWER: What did he say?
>> He didn't say anything.

01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:28.560
Well, I had nothing more to say
at that point because I
understood right then and there
he had no intention of going any

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:41.060
further with this.
So I dropped it.
>> NARRATOR: Charlie Gampero
began his prison sentence of

01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:51.860
seven to 21 years in January
1996.
There was no early release.
The earliest he could be out, if

01:18:51.860 --> 01:19:07.600
granted parole, was 2003.
It was also in 2003 when Kelly
Jarrett got a hearing in front
of the clemency board.

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:17.260
After 26 years in prison, she
began to think for the first
time of life on the outside.
>> I had plans for my life to go

01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:28.930
to the convent, become a
Franciscan sister and to just
live my life outside of prison
walls.

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:37.130
>> NARRATOR: The clemency was
not granted.
There was no explanation.
Only two clemencies were granted

01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:45.630
by Governor Pataki that year,
one of which went to the
satirist Lenny Bruce, who died
37 years before.

01:19:45.630 --> 01:19:51.660
>> As my grandmother would say,
"He should rest in peace."
But I don't think he's up there
in heaven saying that, you know,

01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:55.430
it was good that he got
clemency.
He's probably saying, "She
should have gotten it, give it

01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:59.930
to her."
>> INTERVIEWER: Were you
disappointed?
>> Yes.

01:19:59.930 --> 01:20:10.560
>> INTERVIEWER: So what's going
to happen now?
>> It's up... (<i> choking up</i> )
...excuse me, it's up to the

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:25.630
parole board.
>> NARRATOR: The first parole
hearing for Kelly Jarrett will
take place in 2005, but her

01:20:25.630 --> 01:20:34.730
dilemma may very well follow
her.
Parole boards expect admission
of wrongdoing and expression of

01:20:34.730 --> 01:20:41.830
remorse.
Locked up for almost 30 years
for claiming she is innocent, it
would be hard to imagine her

01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:52.530
saying she is not.
Towards the end of his seventh
year in prison, Charlie Gampero
appeared before his parole

01:20:52.530 --> 01:21:00.960
board.
By then, witnesses had come
forward testifying that they saw
other people beating and kicking

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:09.400
John Weingrad after Charlie had
left the scene.
Charlie was hopeful.
He talked to his parole officer

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:17.330
who thought he had done
everything that the prison asked
him to do, and that he was ready
to be released.

01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:22.330
>> I had told them that even
though there was other people
involved and something happened
after I left, I still take

01:21:22.330 --> 01:21:32.900
responsibility for the crime
because I set, you know, I put
him there.
I explained to them, you know,

01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:38.730
what my ambitions were when I
went home.
I explained to them what I have
done during my incarceration.

01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:48.360
And they told me I'd receive a
response in a couple of days.
>> NARRATOR: The parole was
denied.

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:54.530
The reason given was that since
he was a violent offender,
discretionary release would be
contrary to the best interest of

01:21:54.530 --> 01:22:02.330
the community.
>> It's more than I thought he
would be in prison.
I thought he'd be out by seven

01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:09.430
years, and maybe even earlier,
because of the... they had an
early release program for a
while.

01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:18.360
>> INTERVIEWER: But they didn't
by then.
>> As was sung by that famous
star,<i> que sera sera,</i> I can't

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:26.130
control them.
>> NARRATOR: It was just what
the prosecutor had promised the
victim's father seven years

01:22:26.130 --> 01:22:33.660
before when they agreed on the
plea.
But by then, Joseph Weingrad
wanted Charlie Gampero out of

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:44.230
prison, and wrote a letter to
the parole board.
>> I wrote that it seemed to me
that Mr. Gampero was probably

01:22:44.230 --> 01:22:52.630
only guilty of assault, and so
the time that he spent in prison
was enough.
He shouldn't be spending 21

01:22:52.630 --> 01:23:04.200
years for something that I don't
believe he did!
>> NARRATOR: Charlie Gampero's
next parole hearing will take

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:13.460
place in October 2004.
There is also a new motion
pending to vacate his sentence.
If both were denied, then

01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:22.200
according to the structure of
his sentence, he could spend
another six years in prison.
>> No, that isn't the way the

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:57.660
justice system is supposed to
work in this country.
It's not supposed to work that
way.
