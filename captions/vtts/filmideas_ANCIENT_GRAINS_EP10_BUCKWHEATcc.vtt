00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:11.458
(pulsing music)

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:36.834
- [Voiceover] The grain
market is very diverse.

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:42.166
Many people may not be
aware of it, but maize,

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:43.999
rice,

00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:45.709
and wheat

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:48.125
are not the only
whole foods available

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:51.458
and suitable for their
greener lifestyle.

00:00:52.792 --> 00:00:56.750
With the scientific name
Fagopyrum esculentum,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.750
buckwheat is not a grass.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.667
And despite its name,
it's not related to wheat.

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:05.458
It's a pseudo-cereal
more closely related

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:09.375
to sorrel, knotweed,
and rhubarb.

00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:12.792
According to
archaeological evidence,

00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:15.917
buckwheat is believed to
have been first cultivated

00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:19.709
in Southeast Asia
around 6000 BC,

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:22.375
specifically in the
Tibetan plateaus

00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:24.417
of the Yunnan region in China,

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:28.917
where crops like maize
and rice cannot thrive.

00:01:28.917 --> 00:01:30.959
Buckwheat flourished in China

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:34.792
in the 5th and 6th centuries AD.

00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:38.959
Buckwheat then travelled
from Northern China

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:40.917
to Europe during the Middle Ages

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:44.999
via the famous trading
route, the Silk Road.

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:49.709
And the Mongolian invasion
of Europe in the 13th century

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:54.750
further popularized the grain
all the way to Central Europe.

00:01:57.542 --> 00:01:59.041
It is believed that
the Mongol troops

00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:01.999
brought buckwheat with them
during their march to Europe

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:05.959
because it was a health food
that they could easily prepare,

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.000
even while on the road.

00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:15.999
Because it was introduced
by non-Christians,

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.583
people in Bohemia
call it "pohanka"

00:02:18.583 --> 00:02:22.917
from the Czech word
"pohan", meaning "pagan".

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:27.834
Along with its spread in Europe,

00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:31.166
buckwheat was also eventually
introduced to India.

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:33.417
From Europe, it
sailed to the colonies

00:02:33.417 --> 00:02:35.999
in North America in the 1600s,

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.959
but it didn't flourish
until the mid-1800s

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.999
when it became widely used
as livestock feed and flour.

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.333
There is also
archaeological proof

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:51.542
that buckwheat was
already cultivated

00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:53.999
in Japan in the 8th century,

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.333
and that Emperor
Gensho ordered its

00:02:56.333 --> 00:03:00.166
countrywide cultivation in 722.

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:08.333
Planting buckwheat is not
as demanding as other crops.

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:12.333
It thrives in low-nutrient,
drained, acidic soils,

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:14.583
and even in
elevations as high as

00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:16.834
4000 meters above sea level.

00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:22.041
It also doesn't require any
additional chemical fertilizers.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:31.417
Adding nitrogen fertilizer
is not recommended

00:03:31.417 --> 00:03:32.999
because it can reduce yield,

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:37.542
making buckwheat very
suitable for organic farming.

00:03:41.083 --> 00:03:43.999
Buckwheat plants grow
up to four feet tall,

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.750
with alternating
heart-shaped leaves

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.375
that are two to
three inches long.

00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:49.999
It's a short season crop,

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:52.999
taking only 12 weeks
for it to mature.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:56.333
Here's a typical life
cycle of buckwheat.

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:01.999
Seedlings start to emerge three
to five days after sowing.

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:03.999
Leaves sprout during
the third week

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:07.333
and continue to grow
in the sixth week.

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.959
Flowers start to bloom
and the seed sets in

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.792
within the sixth
and seventh week.

00:04:15.083 --> 00:04:17.999
The seed continues to
develop in the eighth week

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:21.999
and it finally matures
in the 12th week.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.125
Aside from milling
buckwheat into flour,

00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:33.083
it is also a favorite cover
and smother crop of farmers.

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:41.458
Buckwheat is used in soil
nutrition management,

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:43.999
erosion prevention,

00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:46.625
and weed suppression.

00:04:49.458 --> 00:04:52.458
But as the organic
lifestyle and diet trend

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.542
continues to rise,

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:56.959
buckwheat still has
a chance to show

00:04:56.959 --> 00:05:00.667
more of its wonders
in food and nutrition.

00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:15.542
Buckwheat is popularly
used in different countries

00:05:15.542 --> 00:05:18.834
to nourish and protect
farm soil against weeds,

00:05:18.834 --> 00:05:22.999
but its nutritional value also
deserves a closer inspection

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:27.083
to better appreciate what
else this grain can offer.

00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:30.999
Like wheat, buckwheat is
packed with nutrients,

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:32.625
minerals, and vitamins.

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:34.709
Here's a basic
nutritional breakdown

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.999
of a hundred gram
serving of buckwheat.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.917
It has very competitive
amounts of protein

00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:44.041
at 13.25 grams,

00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:46.375
and fiber at 10 grams.

00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:49.917
It also has an impressive
lineup of amino acids,

00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:52.709
including a significant
amount of lysine,

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:56.667
an amino acid deficient
in most grains.

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:01.500
Sufficient lysine levels
ensure that the body

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.125
effectively absorbs
and conserves calcium,

00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:08.000
which makes it a very important
part of a child's diet

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.875
during his formative years.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.959
It also promotes overall
muscle and bone health.

00:06:17.083 --> 00:06:20.333
Together with another
amino acid arginine,

00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:22.333
which is also
abundant in buckwheat,

00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:24.583
it can aid in
repairing bone tissue

00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:26.834
as well as synthesize
collagen for healthier

00:06:26.834 --> 00:06:31.834
connective tissues,
cartilage, tendons, and skin.

00:06:33.375 --> 00:06:36.041
People recovering from
injuries and operations

00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:38.999
may benefit from these
muscle-building properties

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:43.125
of lysine and arginine
present in buckwheat.

00:06:43.375 --> 00:06:46.208
Buckwheat also has
resistant starch.

00:06:46.208 --> 00:06:49.291
Considered to be the third
kind of dietary fiber,

00:06:49.291 --> 00:06:53.166
resistant starch is believed
to promote a healthy colon,

00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:56.417
improve the body's
insulin sensitivity,

00:06:56.417 --> 00:06:58.875
and induce satiety.

00:07:00.083 --> 00:07:04.166
Its mineral composition is
as good as wheat and oats.

00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:08.417
100 grams of buckwheat has
the following minerals.

00:07:08.417 --> 00:07:10.709
18mg of calcium,

00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:14.583
2.2mg of iron,

00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:17.583
231mg of magnesium,

00:07:17.583 --> 00:07:20.625
347mg of phosphorus,

00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:23.999
460mg of potassium,

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:26.542
2.4mg of zinc,

00:07:26.542 --> 00:07:29.208
1.1mg of copper,

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.999
1.3mg of manganese,

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:35.999
and 8.3mg of selenium.

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:40.667
Buckwheat's bioavailability
of zinc, copper,

00:07:40.667 --> 00:07:41.999
and potassium is high,

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:44.750
meaning a large percentage
of these minerals

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.375
is effectively assimilated
into the system.

00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:52.999
Also, its high levels of
phosphorus, magnesium,

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:56.625
iron, copper,
zinc, and manganese

00:07:56.625 --> 00:07:59.667
is beneficial to people
suffering from anemia,

00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:01.500
since these minerals contribute

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.291
in the formation of hemoglobin.

00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:10.959
Buckwheat is also rich in
vitamins, especially B vitamins.

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:13.458
It has 0.1mg of thiamin,

00:08:13.458 --> 00:08:15.959
0.4mg of riboflavin,

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:19.583
1.23mg of pantothenic acid,

00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:22.375
7.02mg of niacin,

00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:25.458
and 30 micrograms of folate.

00:08:28.834 --> 00:08:31.458
These vitamins are
essential in maintaining

00:08:31.458 --> 00:08:33.125
a healthy cardiovascular system

00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:37.166
due to their abilities to
reduce cholesterol in the blood.

00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:39.792
Together with the
amino acid arginine

00:08:39.792 --> 00:08:42.792
these vitamins can
strengthen blood vessels

00:08:42.792 --> 00:08:44.625
and improve blood circulation,

00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:47.709
beneficial to people
prone to hypertension

00:08:47.709 --> 00:08:49.875
and heart diseases.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.291
Good blood circulation
is vital for the body's

00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:57.834
different systems to
function properly.

00:08:57.834 --> 00:09:02.792
Buckwheat is a reliable source
of a flavonoid called rutin.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:06.250
Rutin has the ability to
fortify blood vessels,

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.917
arteries, and capillaries,

00:09:07.917 --> 00:09:10.458
helping the body avoid
conditions such as

00:09:10.458 --> 00:09:12.792
chronic venous insufficiency,

00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:14.500
edema, hemorrhoids,

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.834
microangiopathy, and
other venous disorders.

00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:37.667
Buckwheat's overall
nutritional profile

00:09:37.667 --> 00:09:39.250
reads very beneficial to people

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.959
who are at risk of
contracting heart disease,

00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:45.250
which only shows that this
ancient grain has more to it

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.999
than just warding
off weeds in farms.

00:09:53.542 --> 00:09:57.375
Buckwheat, a tiny grain
for a healthy heart.

00:10:15.709 --> 00:10:17.999
Buckwheat may have
originated in Asia,

00:10:17.999 --> 00:10:20.999
but that didn't stop this
grain from integrating itself

00:10:20.999 --> 00:10:24.625
in traditions and customs
of Western countries.

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:27.667
First, here are some of
buckwheat's involvements

00:10:27.667 --> 00:10:29.583
in Asian culture.

00:10:32.125 --> 00:10:36.000
For the Hindus, buckwheat is
an important part of their diet

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.208
during holy days of
fasting and abstinence.

00:10:39.208 --> 00:10:42.875
During the fasting
days of the Ekadashi,

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:45.959
Janmashtami, Maha Shivaratri,

00:10:45.959 --> 00:10:47.750
and Navaratri Festivals,

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.458
eating cereals such as wheat
and rice is prohibited.

00:10:51.458 --> 00:10:54.458
Since buckwheat is
technically not a cereal,

00:10:54.458 --> 00:10:57.125
Hindus can eat foods
prepared from buckwheat,

00:10:57.125 --> 00:11:01.999
like kuttu ki puri, pancakes
made from buckwheat.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.625
And kuttu pakoras,
fried potatoes

00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:08.166
coated with buckwheat flour.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.041
In China, Korea, and
especially in Japan,

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:19.709
buckwheat is famous for
being used in making noodles.

00:11:22.333 --> 00:11:26.125
In Japan buckwheat flour
is the primary ingredient

00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:29.709
in making traditional
soba noodles.

00:11:31.208 --> 00:11:35.999
"Soba" is a direct translation
of "buckwheat" in Japanese.

00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:38.999
During the Edo period which was

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:41.959
between 1603 and 1867,

00:11:41.959 --> 00:11:45.875
people customarily ate soba
at the end of each month,

00:11:45.875 --> 00:11:49.417
a tradition called
"Misoka-soba".

00:11:49.999 --> 00:11:54.375
Misoka-soba was a thanksgiving
celebration by the Japanese,

00:11:54.375 --> 00:11:58.000
having survived another
month in good health.

00:11:58.999 --> 00:12:03.000
Today soba is a ceremonial
dish during New Year's Day.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.834
This also originated
during the Edo period,

00:12:05.834 --> 00:12:09.333
when people didn't typically
celebrate their birthdays.

00:12:09.333 --> 00:12:11.834
Instead they all
regarded New Year

00:12:11.834 --> 00:12:13.125
to be everyone's birthday,

00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:15.083
and eating soba
during the New Year's

00:12:15.083 --> 00:12:20.083
is both a sign of gratitude
and a wish for long life.

00:12:28.083 --> 00:12:32.999
Now here is buckwheat's cultural
significance in the West.

00:12:34.667 --> 00:12:36.750
In West Virginia, United States,

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:37.999
a three-day festival called

00:12:37.999 --> 00:12:40.417
the Preston County
Buckwheat Festival

00:12:40.417 --> 00:12:43.458
is celebrated every September.

00:12:44.083 --> 00:12:47.417
It started during the latter
part of the Great Depression

00:12:47.417 --> 00:12:49.834
when farmers in Preston
County believed that

00:12:49.834 --> 00:12:54.917
buckwheat was the grain that
could revitalize their economy.

00:12:56.291 --> 00:13:01.208
So in October 1938 at the
end of the harvesting season,

00:13:01.208 --> 00:13:03.000
the locals organized the first

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.041
Preston County
Buckwheat Festival

00:13:05.041 --> 00:13:07.542
where everyone enjoyed
different activities,

00:13:07.542 --> 00:13:11.458
games, and a banquet
of buckwheat cakes.

00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:16.041
Today there's also the
Buckwheat Royalty Pageant,

00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:20.999
where a King Buckwheat and
Queen Ceres are crowned.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.250
The Danish author Hans
Christian Andersen

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.625
took a particular
liking to buckwheat,

00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:33.375
and used it to write a tale
entitled "The Buckwheat".

00:13:35.667 --> 00:13:37.917
If you see a buckwheat
field blackened

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:41.333
as if it were set on
fire after a storm,

00:13:41.999 --> 00:13:43.542
well according to the tale,

00:13:43.542 --> 00:13:46.999
it's because it was
hit by lightning.

00:13:47.583 --> 00:13:51.750
In the story the buckwheat
was a very proud plant.

00:13:51.959 --> 00:13:54.625
Unlike the other grains, wheat,

00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:56.542
rye,

00:13:57.208 --> 00:13:58.291
barley,

00:13:58.291 --> 00:13:59.709
oat, and corn,

00:13:59.709 --> 00:14:03.083
which didn't mind bending
their stems towards the earth,

00:14:03.083 --> 00:14:07.000
the buckwheat always
stood tall and proud.

00:14:09.125 --> 00:14:11.667
One day a storm hit the fields.

00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:13.250
The other grains
folded their leaves

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:16.999
and bowed their heads as
they waited the storm out,

00:14:16.999 --> 00:14:18.834
but not the buckwheat.

00:14:18.834 --> 00:14:21.041
Because of his pride,
he stood firmly

00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:23.417
and even boldly
gazed at the skies,

00:14:23.417 --> 00:14:27.166
where lightning flashed
across the heavens.

00:14:28.999 --> 00:14:32.375
After the storm, the other
grains saw the buckwheat

00:14:32.375 --> 00:14:36.125
laying low and burnt
down like a weed.

00:14:41.709 --> 00:14:46.166
Different cultures may have
different uses for buckwheat,

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.625
but it will remain an
important crop today

00:14:49.625 --> 00:14:51.333
and in the future.

00:15:21.792 --> 00:15:24.959
Buckwheat did not experience
a cease in production

00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:27.999
because of its important
role in livestock feeding

00:15:27.999 --> 00:15:30.000
and soil and weed management.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.999
However there was a
decline in cultivation

00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:36.125
when nitrogen fertilizers
were introduced.

00:15:36.125 --> 00:15:38.208
Maize and wheat
responded positively

00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:42.999
to nitrogen fertilizers,
increasing yield and production,

00:15:42.999 --> 00:15:44.500
while buckwheat didn't.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.417
And so maize and wheat
became the farm favorites.

00:15:52.291 --> 00:15:54.709
Thanks to the recent
green revolution

00:15:54.709 --> 00:15:56.125
and organic food movement,

00:15:56.125 --> 00:15:58.999
buckwheat can now
show the modern market

00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:01.041
what else it can offer.

00:16:05.333 --> 00:16:08.125
Based on the Food and
Agriculture Organization

00:16:08.125 --> 00:16:09.166
of the United Nations,

00:16:09.166 --> 00:16:11.917
the following countries
were the top three

00:16:11.917 --> 00:16:15.291
producers of buckwheat in 2012.

00:16:16.834 --> 00:16:21.709
Number one, China with
700,000 metric tons.

00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:30.875
Number two, Poland with
94,421 metric tons.

00:16:33.917 --> 00:16:38.875
And number three, Brazil
with 60,000 metric tons.

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:44.709
Other buckwheat producing
countries are Japan,

00:16:44.999 --> 00:16:46.999
the United States,

00:16:47.959 --> 00:16:49.417
and Russia.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.625
As a cover crop or
green manure crop,

00:16:55.625 --> 00:16:57.166
buckwheat helps farmers manage

00:16:57.166 --> 00:16:59.999
the levels and range
of macronutrients

00:16:59.999 --> 00:17:02.250
and micronutrients in the soil.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:05.208
Buckwheat is plowed under
the soil where it decays

00:17:05.208 --> 00:17:08.667
and nourishes the soil with
nitrogen and other minerals,

00:17:08.667 --> 00:17:11.999
thus improving the overall
condition of the soil

00:17:11.999 --> 00:17:14.458
for the next crops to grow.

00:17:19.166 --> 00:17:22.041
Because buckwheat is
a short season crop,

00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:24.792
it is also used
to suppress weeds.

00:17:24.792 --> 00:17:26.792
Actually buckwheat has been used

00:17:26.792 --> 00:17:29.125
to suppress weeds for
hundreds of years,

00:17:29.125 --> 00:17:32.291
and that's why even US
Presidents George Washington

00:17:32.291 --> 00:17:35.125
and Thomas Jefferson
corresponded with each other

00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:38.999
about buckwheat's success
as a weed suppressant

00:17:38.999 --> 00:17:41.375
in their respect farms.

00:17:44.458 --> 00:17:47.500
Other interesting
non-food uses of buckwheat

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.542
are for pillows and as plaster.

00:17:52.166 --> 00:17:56.208
Homeopathic pillows are often
filled with buckwheat hulls

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:58.458
as well as heating
and cooling packs

00:17:58.458 --> 00:18:02.041
which are laced with
different relaxing scents.

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:06.999
Buckwheat can also be
processed into a special type

00:18:06.999 --> 00:18:09.999
of plaster that draws
out retained water

00:18:09.999 --> 00:18:12.166
from swollen areas of the body,

00:18:12.166 --> 00:18:14.291
specially the abdomen.

00:18:16.375 --> 00:18:19.250
Buckwheat flour is
mixed with hot water

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:20.959
to form a stiff dough.

00:18:20.959 --> 00:18:23.999
This dough is then applied
on the swollen area

00:18:23.999 --> 00:18:28.750
and secured by bandages
and left for four hours.

00:18:30.166 --> 00:18:32.583
Two to three times
application is needed

00:18:32.583 --> 00:18:35.583
before any effect is observed.

00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:39.417
The consumption of buckwheat

00:18:39.417 --> 00:18:41.417
is usually in the form of flour.

00:18:41.417 --> 00:18:45.250
Buckwheat flour is dark because
even if it underwent milling

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.999
some hull fragments
are left behind.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.417
Unlike wheat which can be
sold as pure wheat flour,

00:18:53.417 --> 00:18:57.834
buckwheat flour is often
sold as a pancake mix.

00:18:59.875 --> 00:19:02.333
In Asian countries
buckwheat kernels

00:19:02.333 --> 00:19:05.667
are roasted and used as tea.

00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:09.083
The darker the kernels
get during roasting,

00:19:09.083 --> 00:19:12.500
the stronger the
flavor it will have.

00:19:13.333 --> 00:19:16.291
Aside from tea,
buckwheat is also used

00:19:16.291 --> 00:19:18.750
as a traditional
source of honey.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:22.917
Buckwheat flowers are a
favorite of many pollinators.

00:19:22.917 --> 00:19:25.625
Pure buckwheat honey
has a very dark color,

00:19:25.625 --> 00:19:28.875
and has a distinct
strong flavor.

00:19:33.792 --> 00:19:36.709
In India, aside from
its grain and straw

00:19:36.709 --> 00:19:38.458
its leaves are also harvested

00:19:38.458 --> 00:19:42.250
and eaten just like
any leafy vegetable.

00:19:45.999 --> 00:19:50.125
Buckwheat may not be as
popular as maize and wheat,

00:19:52.583 --> 00:19:54.709
but it seems to
have specific uses

00:19:54.709 --> 00:19:57.542
that will allow it to
enjoy a stable standing

00:19:57.542 --> 00:20:00.542
in the global grain industry.

00:20:12.875 --> 00:20:15.834
Buckwheat can be enjoyed
in different ways.

00:20:15.834 --> 00:20:18.250
Porridge and pancakes
are two of the basic

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.208
and widely used consumed dishes

00:20:20.208 --> 00:20:23.999
made out of buckwheat
flour and groats.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.041
The conventional
grain to water ratio

00:20:27.041 --> 00:20:30.750
in cooking buckwheat
kernels is one is to two.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:33.750
One cup kernel to
two cups of water.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.250
Just put the kernels
and water in a pot

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:37.542
and bring it to a boil.

00:20:37.542 --> 00:20:40.709
Once boiling, reduce
heat and let it simmer

00:20:40.709 --> 00:20:43.834
for 10 to 20 minutes
or until tender.

00:20:43.834 --> 00:20:47.000
Buckwheat kernels also
increase in volume when cooked,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.625
so make sure to use a
big enough pot or pan.

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:52.542
Now in case you're
wondering what dishes

00:20:52.542 --> 00:20:56.166
other than pancakes can be
prepared using buckwheat,

00:20:56.166 --> 00:20:58.999
you can try these two recipes.

00:20:58.999 --> 00:21:02.417
First, buckwheat
and mushrooms pilaf.

00:21:02.417 --> 00:21:06.000
You will need one cup
of buckwheat groats,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.125
two cups of vegetable broth,

00:21:08.125 --> 00:21:10.999
40 grams dried wild mushroom mix

00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:12.625
soaked in hot water,

00:21:12.625 --> 00:21:16.166
one half teaspoon of
ground caraway seed,

00:21:16.166 --> 00:21:18.999
one teaspoon of dried marjoram,

00:21:19.458 --> 00:21:21.125
one teaspoon of salt,

00:21:21.125 --> 00:21:23.458
one teaspoon of black pepper,

00:21:23.458 --> 00:21:25.583
one teaspoon of garlic powder,

00:21:25.583 --> 00:21:27.166
one small yellow onion,

00:21:27.166 --> 00:21:29.999
and one tablespoon
of vegetable oil.

00:21:29.999 --> 00:21:35.083
First soak the dried mushrooms
in hot water for 10 minutes.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.999
Second, in a
saucepan heat the oil

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:43.500
and sauté the onion
until transparent.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.291
Drain the mushrooms
and put them in the pan

00:21:45.291 --> 00:21:50.166
with the onions and sauté
for another three minutes.

00:21:52.083 --> 00:21:55.999
Put the buckwheat groats,
marjoram, caraway seeds,

00:21:55.999 --> 00:21:59.083
garlic powder,
salt, black pepper,

00:21:59.083 --> 00:22:01.667
and vegetable broth in the mix.

00:22:01.667 --> 00:22:05.999
Make sure to stir well until
everything is combined.

00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:08.166
Cook over medium heat uncovered

00:22:08.166 --> 00:22:11.125
until the buckwheat
has absorbed the broth

00:22:11.125 --> 00:22:13.250
or until it's tender.

00:22:13.709 --> 00:22:17.667
Now for the other
recipe, buckwheat salad.

00:22:17.667 --> 00:22:19.166
Just prepare the following.

00:22:19.166 --> 00:22:22.917
Three quarters cup of
roasted buckwheat groats,

00:22:22.917 --> 00:22:24.625
five cups of water,

00:22:24.625 --> 00:22:26.542
one half teaspoon salt,

00:22:26.542 --> 00:22:27.834
one half green bell pepper

00:22:27.834 --> 00:22:30.291
chopped into half inch cubes,

00:22:30.291 --> 00:22:31.959
one half red bell pepper

00:22:31.959 --> 00:22:34.000
chopped into half inch cubes,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.291
half a cucumber, peeled, seeded,

00:22:36.291 --> 00:22:38.999
and chopped into
one half inch cubes,

00:22:38.999 --> 00:22:41.792
three tablespoons
of chopped cilantro,

00:22:41.792 --> 00:22:44.999
seven stalks of green
onion with scallions,

00:22:44.999 --> 00:22:46.750
three quarters cup of carrot

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.333
chopped into half inch cubes,

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:51.999
and one third cup of
slivered almonds, toasted.

00:22:51.999 --> 00:22:53.208
For the dressing you will need

00:22:53.208 --> 00:22:56.750
three quarters tablespoon
of tamari soy sauce,

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.917
one and one half
tablespoons of lemon juice,

00:22:59.917 --> 00:23:02.250
three tablespoons of olive oil,

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.041
a quarter teaspoon of salt,

00:23:04.041 --> 00:23:06.667
two tablespoons
of ginger, minced,

00:23:06.667 --> 00:23:10.750
and two tablespoons of
garlic, also minced.

00:23:10.999 --> 00:23:13.999
First put the groats
in four cups of water

00:23:13.999 --> 00:23:15.250
and bring it to a boil.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:19.542
Then add half a teaspoon of
salt and cook for 15 minutes

00:23:19.542 --> 00:23:22.375
or until the groats
are al dente.

00:23:22.375 --> 00:23:24.166
Drain the groats in a colander,

00:23:24.166 --> 00:23:26.999
rinse with cold
water and set aside.

00:23:26.999 --> 00:23:29.500
Blanche the carrots
in one cup of water

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.792
for two to three minutes.

00:23:30.792 --> 00:23:35.625
Remove from water, rinse with
cold water, then set aside.

00:23:35.625 --> 00:23:38.999
Third, chop off the
tips of the green onions

00:23:38.999 --> 00:23:40.999
and slice lengthwise.

00:23:40.999 --> 00:23:44.291
And lastly, in a large
bowl toss together

00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:46.667
the buckwheat groats, carrots,

00:23:46.667 --> 00:23:49.166
red and green bell
peppers, cucumber,

00:23:49.166 --> 00:23:51.999
cilantro, and the green onions.

00:23:51.999 --> 00:23:54.083
Drizzle the dressing and garnish

00:23:54.083 --> 00:23:56.291
with the almonds before serving.

00:23:56.291 --> 00:23:59.583
Pancakes, porridge,
pilaf, or salads.

00:23:59.583 --> 00:24:01.083
It doesn't matter
which you prefer,

00:24:01.083 --> 00:24:04.750
as long as you get to enjoy
the many benefits of buckwheat.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:08.750
Not just for your palate,
but for your health as well.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:12.999
