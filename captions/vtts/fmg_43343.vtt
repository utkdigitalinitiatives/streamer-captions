00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.740



00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.920

        There are some great questions
        that have intrigued and
      

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.400

        haunted us since the
        dawn of humanity.
      

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.500



00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.750

        What is out there?


00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.820



00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.070

        How did we get here?


00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.080



00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.340

        What is the world made of?


00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.060



00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.660

        The story of our search to
        answer these questions is the
      

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.910

        story of science.


00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.530



00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.940

        Of all human endeavors, science
        has had the greatest
      

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.610

        impact on our lives, on
        how we see the world,
      

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.640

        on how we see ourselves.


00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:59.510

        Its ideas, its achievements, its
        results are all around us.
      

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.770

        But the story of science has
        been shaped as much by what's
      

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.070

        outside the laboratory
        as inside.
      

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.830

        Power and passion, rivalry and
        sheer chance have all played
      

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.080

        significant roles.


00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.390



00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.700

        This is the story of how history
        made science, and how
      

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.050

        science made history.


00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:34.480



00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.300

        This time an ancient
        human ambition.
      

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.310

        The search for limitless
        power.
      

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:54.530



00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.570

        We are the most power-hungry
        generation
      

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.100

        that has ever lived.


00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.290

        Energy is the heartbeat
        of our civilization.
      

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.080



00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.350

        The quest to discover what power
        can do and what power
      

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.560

        actually is forms
        the foundation
      

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.790

        of the modern world.


00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.670

        Together these simple aims
        have led to some of the
      

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.100

        greatest insights in the
        history of science.
      

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.710



00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.250

        The 17th century was a pivotal
        age when the balance between
      

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.490

        man and nature began
        to change forever.
      

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.480

        There was of course
        no electricity.
      

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.440

        There were no cars, no trains.


00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.580

        The most common power sources
        had to be fed and watered.
      

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.860

        Horsepower meant just that.


00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.430



00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.400

        But a remote beach in Holland
        was the setting for a glimpse
      

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.650

        of what was to come.


00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:18.640



00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.860

        400 years ago you might have
        been surprised to see a much
      

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.030

        larger version of one
        of these fly past.
      

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.300

        It was 8 meters long
        and 4 meters wide.
      

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.910

        It had wheels with a diameter
        of 2 meters.
      

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.090

        It was the ancestor of the
        modern land yachts

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.170



00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.940

        It was called the
        wind chariot.
      

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.790

        Designed to carry heavily armed


00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.040

        soldiers along the coastline.


00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.180



00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.460

        It amazed and terrified
        in equal measure.
      

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.500



00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.380

        Here was the power of the wind
        being harnessed to produce
      

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.820

        motion on land.


00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.770



00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.730

        These yachts was the fastest
        thing ever made by man.
      

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.730

        And to give you an impression,
        it outplays a running horse.
      

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.270

        The wind chariot was designed
        by an engineer and
      

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.030

        mathematician called Simon
        Stevin, a man who would
      

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.210

        literally change the face of
        Holland and help turn it into
      

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.460

        a great trading empire.


00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.770



00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.590

        Simon Stevin developed
        something really
      

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.210

        unique 409 years ago.


00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.120

        Amazing.


00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.420

        But Stevin's ambitions for
        window power went far beyond
      

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.470

        just chariots.


00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.610

        He wanted to change his country
        by harnessing the
      

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.860

        power of the wind as
        no one had before.
      

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.950

        And his tool was to
        be mathematics.
      

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.790



00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.860

        Mathematics was changing.


00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.800

        For 100's of years in the
        universities geometry and
      

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.270

        arithmetic had been important
        theoretical pursuits.
      

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.340

        Practical applications, like
        building bridges and firing
      

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.380

        cannons, were limited.


00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.180

        But now men like Simon Stevin
        would use math's theory to
      

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.710

        create something much
        bigger, a new
      

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.380

        mathematically grounded science.


00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.840



00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.490

        And that would help them solve
        a whole range of complex
      

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.860

        problems.


00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.410

        The problem Stevin turned his
        mathematics to was a crucial
      

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:49.100

        one in low-lying Holland, how
        to keep the country dry.
      

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.890

        Professor Gerard van Bussel
        has studied his work.
      

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.250



00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.630

        Simon Stevin did not only
        perform mathematics, so they
      

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.020

        say, but he wanted to
        see how he could use
      

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.350

        that to improve machines.


00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.080

        For over a century Holland's
        windmills have been scooping
      

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.620

        water from drainage ditches,
        tipping it into the canals to
      

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.870

        carry it away.


00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.680



00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.100

        Stevin was convinced that
        mathematics could make
      

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.720

        windmills much more efficient.


00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.720



00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.320

        But it was a complex
        undertaking.
      

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.100



00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.710

        The difficulty is, this is not
        a perpendicular gearing.
      

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.980

        But this wheel is slightly
        tilted, something like 13
      

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.380

        degrees and so on.


00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.970

        And that makes the movement of
        these teeth inside these stays
      

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:40.840

        very complex.


00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.720

        It's not only rotating, but also
        moving up and downwards
      

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.970

        and moving inwards
        and outwards.
      

00:06:44.970 --> 00:07:02.310



00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.870

        Stevin would have to account for
        every one of those angles
      

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.120

        and movements.


00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.540



00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.530

        From the sails to the
        shaft to the cogs.
      

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:18.680



00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.310

        It was a mathematical
        minefield.
      

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.110



00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.790

        To improve the efficiency of the
        windmill, his calculations
      

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.220

        would require a completely
        new approach.
      

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.370

        Really a kind of
        three-dimensional mathematics
      

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.920

        that you need to
        be able to do.
      

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.540

        Before Stevin no one
        could do that.
      

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:44.960



00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.550

        Stevin designed new cogs,
        paddle wheel shapes, and
      

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.850

        sluices, even a chain of
        windmills that could be used
      

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.580

        to drain not just fields,
        but a lake.
      

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.620



00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.380

        His modifications were so
        effective, this new
      

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.800

        mathematically designed windmill
        was three times more
      

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.010

        efficient than the
        ones it replaced.
      

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.900

        What's more, Stevin patented his
        many inventions to ensure
      

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.580

        that his work would
        be well-rewarded.
      

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.890

        Mathematics made Stevin rich.


00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.460

        And it wasn't long before
        it started to
      

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.860

        change the whole country.


00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:32.620



00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.470

        Holland would use that you
        wouldn't be able to help them
      

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.470

        develop into an industrial
        powerhouse.
      

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:48.840



00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.330

        Seeds and nuts were ground to
        extract their valuable oil.
      

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:58.230



00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.750

        Paper mills became mechanized.


00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:05.920



00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.300

        Wood could be cut 30 times
        faster and with greater
      

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.640

        precision than by hand.


00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.900



00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.320

        Helping to turn this small
        country into the biggest
      

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.020

        shipbuilders in western
        Europe.
      

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:29.940



00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.910

        To the sound of mathematically
        designed mills whirring in the
      

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:41.590

        wind, Holland became a dynamic
        trading nation and Amsterdam
      

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.550

        one of the richest and most
        cosmopolitan cities on Earth.
      

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:53.530



00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.280

        The economic growth of
        Holland changed the
      

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.980

        power map of Europe.


00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.360

        It had been helped by advances
        in windmill design, a new
      

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.610

        mathematically based science.


00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:10.550

        And a belief amongst men like
        Simon Stevin that science
      

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.580

        should be useful.


00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.230

        It was obvious what
        power could do.
      

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.060

        What was still missing was any
        scientific understanding of
      

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.520

        what power actually is.


00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:29.020



00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.460

        That would only begin to emerge
        far later on the other
      

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.790

        side of the English Channel.


00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:40.040



00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.830

        The English country house of the
        18th century was a place
      

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:50.260

        of intrigue, romance and gossip,
        but was also host to
      

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.180

        the occasional visiting
        experimenter.
      

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.900



00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.540

        An unlikely combination that
        would mark the birth of a
      

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:02.450

        world-changing new
        source of power.
      

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.480

        Science had become popular
        entertainment
      

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.620

        for the drawing room.


00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.490

        Contraptions developed as real
        scientific experiments dazzled
      

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:12.740

        and amazed.


00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.590



00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.790

        Those looking on
        were stunned by
      

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.650

        phenomena like static charge.


00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.360



00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.400

        And silenced by the baffling
        qualities of the vacuum.
      

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.670



00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.010

        An alarm was placed in a vacuum
        jar and set to go off.
      

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.840



00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.380

        The air was pumped out.


00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.800

        And when the alarm rang,
        nothing could be heard.
      

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.720



00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.470

        No one really had a satisfactory
        scientific
      

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.300

        explanation for these things.


00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.340

        But the spectacle helped
        bring new ideas to a
      

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.650

        new attentive audience.


00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.150



00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.970

        And to one ambitious
        entrepreneur in particular.
      

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:08.270



00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.810

        Matthew Boulton was a
        manufacturer who belonged to a
      

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:15.250

        group called the Lunar Society,
        so-called because
      

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:19.280

        they met on the night
        of the full moon.
      

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.150

        The Lunar Society brought
        together industrialists,
      

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.370

        experimenters, and natural
        philosophers, who all shared a
      

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.840

        love of practical knowledge.


00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.610

        Through the Lunar Society,
        Matthew Boulton met the
      

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:36.560

        Scottish inventor and
        engineer James Watt.
      

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.070



00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.820

        For some years Watt had
        been working with
      

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.750

        prototype steam engines.


00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.560

        This prompted Boulton to invite
        him to take part in a
      

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.810

        joint business venture.


00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.530



00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.890

        Together they would form one
        of the most powerful
      

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.470

        relationships of the
        18th century.
      

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.570

        And the steam engine they
        produced would transform not
      

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:05.650

        just technology, but
        science itself.
      

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:13.300



00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.780

        This is an original Boulton and
        Watt steam engine with all
      

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:25.870

        the expected elements, a man,
        some coal, and a furnace.
      

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.980

        What might be less expected is
        that it is stationary, and it
      

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:36.370

        is vast. So vast that this
        engine, originally built to
      

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.970

        keep the nearby canal topped
        up with water, occupies the
      

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:44.840

        entire building and boasts
        its very own driver.
      

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.380

        Today Harry Willis is
        at the controls.
      

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.420



00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.840

        We call this the driving
        platform.
      

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.060

        These are the levers that
        control the valves that
      

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.300

        control the passage of steam
        through the engine.
      

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.030

        This is the steam throttle.


00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.810

        Basically, you turn it that
        way to reduce the steam.
      

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.360

        And you turn it that way
        to increase the steam.
      

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.580

        But the driving force of Boulton
        and Watt's engine is
      

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.470

        not the power of
        steam directly.
      

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:20.070

        Rather an industrial version of
        that country house trick,
      

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.020

        the vacuum.


00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.990

        The steam is injected into the
        cylinder then quickly cooled,
      

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.210

        creating a vacuum.


00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:33.700

        This drags the piston head down
        providing the engine with
      

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.760

        its lifting power.


00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.620

        It's a process this machine is
        still able to perform after
      

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.650

        nearly 200 years.


00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.730

        This engine began to
        work here in 1812.
      

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.860

        Put that in context, it's the
        year that Napoleon retreated
      

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.010

        from Moscow, and you're seeing
        it today actually doing the
      

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.340

        job that it was installed
        to do.
      

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.570

        The modern pumps that normally
        maintain the canal are
      

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:57.270

        switched off.


00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.710

        And they're actually now
        maintaining the canal.
      

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:06.130



00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.650

        Just bear with me.


00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.080

        Just let me get this
        going again.
      

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.720



00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.380

        As you see, you can't keep
        your eye off it.
      

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.970



00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:20.350

        James Watt didn't invent the
        steam engine or even the idea
      

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.200

        of using a vacuum
        to pump water.
      

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.290

        Engines had been powered in
        this way for decades.
      

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.040



00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.490

        Watt's fame and that of his
        machine rests on one small
      

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:36.450

        modification located
        here, right at the
      

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.980

        bottom of the engine.


00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.370

        James Watt's key invention was
        that of a separate condenser.
      

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.450

        He did the condensing action of
        the steam in a tank of cold
      

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:51.400

        water down here, separate
        from the main cylinder.
      

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.030

        By cooling the steam in a
        separate condenser, the
      

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.140

        all-important vacuum could be
        created well away from the hot
      

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:04.120

        cylinders, a small but ingenious
        technical innovation
      

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.370

        with enormous benefits.


00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:08.980



00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.790

        The more efficient the engine,
        the less coal you use for 100
      

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.000

        gallons of water
        that you pump.
      

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.340

        Previous engines would've used
        four times the amount of coal.
      

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.400

        Being four times more efficient,
        the potential
      

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:26.960

        savings from using a Boulton and
        Watt engine were enormous,
      

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.980

        something any business
        man could understand.
      

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.730

        The success of Boulton and
        Watt's engine was not just due
      

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.900

        to new technology, but also a
        clever piece of financial
      

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.180

        engineering.


00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.090

        They had a patent on
        their engines.
      

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:48.650

        They charged a royalty on the
        amount of coal saved by each
      

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:49.850

        of their engines.


00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.120

        And it is also said that they
        charged a royalty on every
      

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.650

        stroke that the engine made.


00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:59.660

        By having a patent, Boulton and
        Watt made money not just
      

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:03.010

        by selling their engines, but
        by charging the owners a
      

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:04.980

        royalty to use them.


00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.430



00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.040

        In our search for power,
        the smell of money
      

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.400

        is rarely far away.


00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.610



00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:20.750

        But for all the riches on
        offer, there was little
      

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:24.920

        scientific theory behind the
        Boulton and Watt engine.
      

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.590

        There was still no real
        explanation to what energy
      

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:30.520

        actually was.


00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.840

        The science would have to wait
        until steam power became a
      

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.090

        force throughout the land.


00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:51.170



00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.620

        The big demand for steam
        engines was in the west
      

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.850

        country, pumping flood
        water from mines.
      

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.070

        And the mine owners soon became
        dependent on Boulton
      

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:03.820

        and Watt's more efficient
        machines.
      

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.790

        Many quickly became
        fed up with having
      

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.040

        to pay annual royalties.


00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.160



00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.740

        In an attempt to avoid Boulton
        and Watt's patent, some
      

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.380

        Cornish engineers began to build
        their own steam engines.
      

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.410



00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:24.760

        One notable steam maverick
        was Richard Trevithick.
      

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.470

        He would take steam power in
        an entirely new direction.
      

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:34.810



00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:41.790

        With this, the puffing devil,
        all eight horsepower of it.
      

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:44.710

        Unlike Boulton and Watt's
        engine, it moved.
      

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:57.510



00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:01.160

        Trevithick's genius was that he
        built high-pressure steam
      

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.040

        engines where the steam
        drives the pistons.
      

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.230

        Trevithick could see that
        high-pressure would be more
      

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:16.110

        efficient, save coal, save
        money, good idea.
      

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.170

        He didn't need vacuums
        or condensers.
      

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.260

        And instead of being the size
        of houses, his steam engines
      

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.280

        were small, powerful, mobile.


00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:30.120



00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.600

        And as an added bonus,
        Trevithick's engine was one of
      

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.750

        the first to produce the
        familiar sound of
      

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.410

        high-pressure steam escaping.


00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:42.810



00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.610

        This new steam engine clearly
        pointed to a better way of
      

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.160

        moving goods and
        people around.
      

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.000

        Yet Trevithick has not gone down
        in history as the father
      

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.670

        of the modern


00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:59.370

        He was working at an ironworks,
        and there was a
      

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.400

        horse drawn tramway, which
        took the steel
      

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.930

        down to a local canal.


00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.840

        And he said, you can
        put a steam engine
      

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.490

        on here, far better.


00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.670

        So we built the steam engine,
        and he demonstrated it would
      

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:12.850

        pull 10 tons.


00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.430

        But there was a problem,
        and it wasn't
      

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.200

        with the puffing devil.


00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.890

        The rails were cast iron, short
        lengths of cast iron.
      

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:23.300

        And with the weight
        on them, they just
      

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.140

        cracked under the strain.


00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:30.760

        And so rather ironically, the
        tram road went back to horse
      

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:30.970

        [? holding ?]


00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:32.220

        again.


00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.890



00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:38.900

        The history of science is full
        of moments like this.
      

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.120

        Great ideas need to happen
        in the right place
      

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.370

        at the right time.


00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.970



00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.560

        Trevithick wasn't a good
        businessman, so he wasn't a
      

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.320

        self-publicist. Had he found
        someone that would've linked
      

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.450

        up with him, I think it would
        have made a huge difference.
      

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:01.110

        Unfortunately Trevithick never
        found his own Matthew Boulton,
      

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:05.280

        someone to invest in his
        ideas and make money.
      

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.970

        Richard Trevithick was simply
        in the wrong place at the
      

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.220

        wrong time.


00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.900



00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:19.070

        Steam engines would have an
        enormous global impact.
      

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.680

        They were born out
        to a combination
      

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.120

        of different forces.


00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.380

        The Lunar Society, where men
        of science could meet and
      

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.070

        exchange ideas.


00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:34.620

        Technical innovations like
        high-pressure steam.
      

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.260

        The promise of money and
        protection of patents.
      

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:48.950



00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.930

        From all this emerged
        a previously
      

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:53.730

        unimaginable source of power.


00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.510



00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:00.020

        The mechanical equivalent of
        countless horses to work the
      

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:06.620

        factories and mills of the
        19th century landscape.
      

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.840

        The steam engines, their
        profits, their owners gave
      

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.660

        political power to a new group
        of people, the middle classes.
      

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.380



00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.990

        These were the forces now
        shaping Victorian Britain.
      

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.670



00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:27.900

        The quest for power had produced
        much, but still with
      

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.350

        no more scientific understanding
        that had existed
      

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.850

        a century before.


00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:37.670

        Only now, belatedly, came the
        theorists drawing on a
      

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.200

        surprising source
        of inspiration.
      

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.450



00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:46.320

        Victorian society was obsessed
        with efficiency.
      

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.840

        Waste was not just uneconomical,
        it was also
      

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.730

        un-Christian.


00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:56.400

        Nowhere was this more true
        than in the kitchen.
      

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.120

        At the end of a meal,
        food wasn't thrown
      

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.460

        away, it was recycled.


00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.180

        Publications like Mrs. Beeton's
        Book of Household
      

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.900

        Management contained numerous
        recipes for
      

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.610

        using valuable leftovers.


00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:12.900

        Old bones to make soup.


00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.300

        Old bread to make a pudding.


00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.310



00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.430

        But it wasn't only
        at home that the
      

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.550

        Victorians were efficient.


00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:26.710

        Science sought efficiency too.


00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.360

        Their attitude towards life
        was also related to their
      

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.570

        attitude towards machines.


00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.440

        If the machine was efficient
        and economic, it
      

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.520

        wasn't being wasteful.


00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.030

        You were using it to its best
        possible advantage.
      

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.750

        As the steam engine took off it
        became important to compare
      

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.460

        which engines were
        more efficient.
      

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.550

        A new theory of energy would
        help make precisely that sort
      

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:50.800

        of judgment.


00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.370



00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.640

        Because in the early 19th
        century, no one really knew
      

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.140

        what energy actually was.


00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:02.620



00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:06.380

        What was becoming increasingly
        clear was that energy in
      

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.210

        different forms was
        interchangeable.
      

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:10.460

        It could be transferred.


00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.210



00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:16.790

        This interchangeability of
        energy was very, very
      

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.380

        fundamental to the science
        at the second
      

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.450

        half of the 19th century.


00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.650

        For the first time such diverse
        things as burning
      

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:28.220

        coals, boiling water, and the
        production of steam could be
      

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:33.450

        united by a single concept,
        that of energy.
      

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:35.650

        The chemical energy of
        the coal was turned
      

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.700

        into heat as it burns.


00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:44.040

        This energy heats the kettle
        and the water inside, which
      

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.040

        then turns into steam.


00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.460

        Steam, which can then be
        used to perform work.
      

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:54.990

        This was a turning
        point in science.
      

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:59.200

        All the research into steam
        engines culminated in two of
      

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.490

        the most important
        laws of physics.
      

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.210

        And they're called the two
        laws of thermodynamics.
      

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:07.390



00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.230

        The first law of thermodynamics
        is a
      

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:14.100

        mathematical description
        of energy known as
      

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.430

        conservation of energy.


00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.890

        It simply states that
        energy cannot
      

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.720

        be created or destroyed.


00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.200

        So you can never get more energy
        out than is contained
      

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.860

        in the fuel you put in.


00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.950

        The second law states
        that no machine can
      

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.190

        ever be 100% efficient.


00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:39.760

        Together they apply to every
        source of power from kettles
      

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:45.270

        to steam engines to windmills.


00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:46.520

        Everything.


00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:53.030



00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:56.300

        Thermodynamics was one of the
        crowning achievements of 19th
      

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.420

        century science.


00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.370

        Inspired in part by the desire
        to explain the technological
      

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:07.880

        wonder of the age, the steam
        engine, and by an obsession
      

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.150

        with thrift and efficiency.


00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.820



00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.420

        But thermodynamics was only one
        part of what was to be a
      

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:18.730

        much more comprehensive theory
        of energy and power.
      

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:43.160



00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:48.710

        In June 1772 a small sailing
        expedition set off for the
      

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:52.990

        coast of France on a voyage that
        would help point science
      

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:54.240

        towards the modern age.


00:26:54.240 --> 00:27:00.020



00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.850

        Its leader was John Walsh,
        recently retired from the
      

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.830

        British East India Company.


00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:10.050

        Walsh was fascinated by the
        electricity found in nature.
      

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:16.730



00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:21.840

        He went looking for it
        not in the skies, but
      

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.510

        underwater in a fish.


00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:28.580



00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.590

        The torpedo fish.


00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:35.230

        It could create electric shocks
        at will and use them to
      

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:36.480

        catch its prey.


00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:46.320



00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.860

        Walsh wanted to find out whether
        the power emitted by
      

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.960

        this strange fish was
        the same as that
      

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.210

        given off by lightning.


00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.850



00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.100

        Or a spark generator.


00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:03.980



00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:07.150

        Some of the fish John Walsh
        brought back are still
      

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:11.230

        preserved at the Hunterian
        Museum in London.
      

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:15.840

        They were dissected by the
        renowned surgeon John Hunter
      

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.860

        to reveal some highly
        peculiar organs.
      

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:21.040



00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:24.840

        What we have here is a section
        through the body of a torpedo.
      

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.610

        Here's the top.


00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:26.740

        Here's the bottom.


00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.470

        This is the front of the fish,
        and a slice has been cut
      

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.020

        through to the body.


00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.960

        I think it was fairly obvious to
        him what was unusual about
      

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.710

        the torpedo.


00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:39.270

        These two very distinctive
        organs, one on each side of
      

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:42.080

        the body, that must be connected
        this ability to
      

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.820

        deliver these shocks.


00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:46.750



00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:50.350

        This slice is taken down the
        length of the body through one
      

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:54.120

        of the pectoral fins, and it
        shows in detail the structure
      

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.030

        of those electric organs.


00:28:56.030 --> 00:29:00.830

        But also Hunter's worked a bit
        of magic on it by injecting it
      

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.280

        with a red dye to show where
        the blood vessels are.
      

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.890

        The electrical charge seemed to
        come from these tiny cells
      

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.770

        now known as electrocytes.


00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.520

        The way in which the torpedo
        generates the charge is
      

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.150

        through having a series of
        electrocytes stacked up within
      

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.170

        the electric organs and
        together, these allow the fish
      

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:22.990

        to generate an electric shock.


00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:26.480

        John Walsh was convinced that
        the electricity from the
      

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.590

        torpedo fish was not only the
        same as the electricity from
      

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:34.740

        lightening, but that it must
        also be possible to generate
      

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:35.990

        it using a machine.


00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:39.080



00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.750

        But plenty of people didn't
        agree with Walsh.
      

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:46.010

        It seemed almost sacrilegious to
        claim that electricity from
      

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:51.060

        a machine made by man was the
        same as electricity from a
      

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.840

        fish, which had been
        created by God.
      

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.240



00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.920

        And yet proof that this was
        indeed the case was just
      

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.170

        around the corner.


00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:13.880



00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.900

        In the archives of the Royal
        Society in London sits a
      

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:23.320

        letter that dates
        back to 1800.
      

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:28.080

        Written by the Italian scientist
        Alessandro Volta, it
      

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.500

        essentially contains
        instructions on how to build
      

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:32.750

        your own torpedo fish.


00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:40.920



00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.910

        This is the letter, a facsimile
        of the letter from
      

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:45.310

        Volta to the Royal Society
        containing all the
      

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:48.690

        instructions together with
        a handy diagram.
      

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:52.610

        And everything I need
        is in this box.
      

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:59.250

        Some plates of zine, plates
        of copper, and some pads
      

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.510

        impregnated with liquid.


00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:18.650



00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:21.970

        Volta said you could carry on
        building these piles as high
      

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.390

        as you liked until they
        became unstable.
      

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:29.620

        And I think we'll finish
        ours there.
      

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:34.340

        It does look a bit like the
        electric organ in the torpedo.
      

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.650

        And it's certain that's what
        Volta had in mind when he
      

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.920

        referred to this as an
        artificial electric organ.
      

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.850

        The Voltaic pile, as it became
        known, could generate a
      

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:48.700

        significant electric current.


00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.130

        Volta couldn't measure it, but
        he could demonstrate that it
      

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:56.240

        delivered a shock just like
        the torpedo fish.
      

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.530

        To an audience in the 18th
        century, the idea that this
      

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:03.130

        could produce a current must
        have come as quite a surprise.
      

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:06.380

        In building his pile, Volta had
        created something really
      

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.140

        exceptional.


00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.700

        A device that could produce
        a constant current of the
      

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.520

        electricity rather than just
        a single discharge.
      

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.690

        He had in fact invented what
        we now know as the battery.
      

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:19.710



00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:23.060

        But for a long time, people had
        no idea what to do with
      

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.230

        the battery.


00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:27.360

        There was no obvious practical
        application.
      

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.140

        There was nothing
        to plug it into.
      

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.750



00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:34.550

        It would be a generation before
        somebody managed to
      

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:36.830

        find a significant
        practical use.
      

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:42.580



00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:46.060

        Outside the world of science,
        the political map of the world
      

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.310

        was changing.


00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:50.080



00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:54.640

        European empires searched out
        new lands to control.
      

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.100

        Ships full of raw materials and
        manufactured goods plied
      

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.100

        the oceans.


00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.440

        If information could be moved
        around this increasingly
      

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.990

        connected world and moved fast,
        it would be of great
      

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:11.260

        benefit to empire builders
        and traders alike.
      

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:19.670



00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:24.710

        Volta's pile was about to get
        plugged into something useful.
      

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:28.440

        And this time it was science
        that led the way.
      

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.420

        Thanks to a man called Hans
        Christian Orsted.
      

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:36.380

        The story is that Hans Orsted
        just happened to be playing
      

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:40.080

        around his apparatus, thinking
        of something exciting to show
      

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.330

        his students.


00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:42.970



00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:46.710

        He had a compass, an electric
        pile, and he
      

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:49.090

        had an electric wire.


00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:52.780

        When Orsted connected everything
        together, something
      

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.460

        unexpected happened.


00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:00.230

        When he put the current on,
        the needle twitched.
      

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:03.790

        When he took it off, the
        needle twitched again.
      

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:08.120

        Somehow the electrical current
        in the wire was acting like a
      

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.270

        magnet and making
        the needle move.
      

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:16.440

        It doesn't seem like a very
        significant set of apparatus.
      

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:20.590

        But within a few years after
        Orsted made that initial
      

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:24.020

        discovery, the world was
        literally transformed.
      

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.110



00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:30.780

        That small twitching compass
        needle rapidly grew into the
      

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.030

        electric telegraph.


00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.540



00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.650

        The power of electricity could
        now be used to send and
      

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:39.480

        receive messages almost
        instantaneously.
      

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:44.640



00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.350

        Telegraph cables were
        soon running
      

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:49.870

        right across the globe.


00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:56.300

        Alongside the era's other great
        invention, steam, the
      

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.630

        combination was unstoppable.


00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:05.750



00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:09.760

        Steam power did the heavy work,
        draining mines, spinning
      

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.800

        cotton, and powering a
        new railway network.
      

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:19.160

        And with the telegraph, the
        battery brought control both
      

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.620

        political and financial.


00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:29.400



00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.290

        Together they helped build
        the empires of
      

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:35.550

        19th century Europe.


00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.320

        But the telegraph also
        marked the start of a
      

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.620

        new ambition in science.


00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:44.590

        When Orsted linked together
        electricity and magnetism,
      

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:49.150

        that was the first step in
        moving towards a grand union
      

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:50.980

        of all the forces of nature.


00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:57.300



00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.840

        Electromagnetism was one of the
        greatest achievements of
      

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.520

        the 19th century.


00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:08.790

        It would go on to explain the
        very nature of light, of radio
      

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:14.790

        waves, even X-rays helping
        persuade 19th century physics
      

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:17.860

        that it had discovered all the
        fundamental laws of nature.
      

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.420



00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.370

        As it turned out, this cozy
        assumption was somewhat wide
      

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:25.620

        of the mark.


00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:35.270



00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:38.550

        At the turn of the 20th century,
        the discovery of a
      

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:41.490

        brand new element was splashed
        across front pages
      

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:45.060

        all over the world.


00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:48.270

        Called radium, it was the
        biggest news in science.
      

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:55.410



00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:58.150

        One reason for all the
        excitement was
      

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:59.400

        the way radium behaved.


00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.520



00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:08.460

        It spontaneously glowed in the
        dark, and created ghostly
      

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:12.670

        patterns on photographic
        plates.
      

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:15.290

        It seemed to be creating
        energy out of nowhere.
      

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:23.260



00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.920

        Radium and its mysterious
        properties caught the public
      

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:30.690

        imagination helping to sell
        a huge range of consumer
      

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:39.470

        products, which is surprising
        since radium is radioactive.
      

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:43.290

        The most famous of these
        products, the Revigator.
      

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:46.700

        Over half a million of these
        sold in the United States in
      

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.650

        the 1920's.


00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:51.240

        Water jar line with
        radioactive ore.
      

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.430

        The consumer would fill it up
        with water, and the following
      

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:58.340

        day, the water would be charged
        with radioactivity.
      

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:02.060

        These are certainly
        radioactive.
      

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:05.670

        So great was the hype
        surrounding radium that small
      

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:08.930

        amounts of it were even
        put into toothpaste,
      

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:13.330

        healing pads, tiny toys.


00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:17.480

        Just the name radium was
        a strong selling point.
      

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.450

        The name radium had
        a real cache.
      

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:22.470

        It indicated something
        of value,
      

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.810

        something of high quality.


00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:27.950

        And so manufacturers
        loved to use that
      

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:29.980

        name with their products.


00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.850

        With the radium beer, radium
        condoms, and radium
      

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:36.980

        cigarettes, you're ready for
        a fun night on the town.
      

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:40.830



00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:44.580

        The scientists responsible for
        first isolating radium were
      

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.690

        Marie Curie and her
        husband Pierre.
      

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.260



00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.400

        It didn't take them long
        to recognize its
      

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.780

        extraordinary potential.


00:38:52.780 --> 00:39:00.510



00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:04.300

        Just one gram contained enough
        energy to turn a ton of
      

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.700

        freezing water into steam.


00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.310



00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:12.480

        While one ton of radium could do
        the work of a million and a
      

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.730

        half tons of coal.


00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:16.230



00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:19.420

        The problem facing the
        scientists was that all this
      

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.500

        seemed to completely
        go against the
      

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.750

        known laws of physics.


00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:25.930



00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:29.280

        The first law of thermodynamics
        stated that
      

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.690

        energy cannot be created
        or destroyed.
      

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:36.710

        But these radioactive substances
        seemed to be
      

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:39.040

        pouring out unlimited
        amounts of energy.
      

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.200



00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.520

        So where was this energy
        coming from?
      

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.050

        The Curies favorite view was
        that radioactive materials,
      

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:52.350

        such as radium, had this unique
        ability to extract
      

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:54.710

        energy from their surroundings
        and then release it in the
      

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:57.650

        form of radiation.


00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:01.450

        As radioactive substances were
        studied more closely,
      

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:04.200

        something peculiar
        was noticed.
      

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.540

        They gradually transform or
        decay into something else.
      

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:13.590

        Radium eventually
        becomes lead.
      

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:16.920

        What scientists realized was
        that as these substances emit
      

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.470

        energy, they also lose mass.


00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:24.510



00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:27.200

        The energy wasn't being
        extracted from the air.
      

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.690

        It wasn't being extracted
        from the ether.
      

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:31.670

        The energy was found
        in the mass.
      

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:34.750



00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:38.490

        The link between energy and mass
        was eventually explained
      

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:40.480

        by Albert Einstein's
        famous equation.
      

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.640



00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:48.250

        Energy equals mass times the
        square of the speed of light.
      

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:51.490



00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:56.320

        E=mc2 points out that the mass
        of the atom, the mass inside
      

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.550

        the nucleus was in fact was
        the energy itself, and the
      

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:03.750

        decay simply transformed
        that mass into energy.
      

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:06.570



00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:09.920

        Scientists had successfully
        explained heat and movement in
      

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.340

        terms of energy.


00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:16.510

        Now energy, which hadn't even
        existed as a concept 50 years
      

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.120

        earlier, was being used
        to explain the
      

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.420

        nature of matter itself.


00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:25.020



00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.860

        In fact there was nothing that
        couldn't now be explained in
      

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.110

        terms of energy.


00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:31.450



00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:37.780

        Not just steam engines and
        windmills, but living things.
      

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:42.000

        Stars, even galaxies,
        all were governed
      

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.250

        by the laws of energy.


00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:47.730



00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:51.970

        In its quest to understand what
        power is, science had
      

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:54.420

        uncovered secrets which
        lay at the very
      

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.670

        heart of the universe.


00:41:55.670 --> 00:42:03.740



00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:09.360

        The theory encapsulated in E=mc2
        would eventually lead to
      

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.500

        nuclear energy and
        the atomic bomb.
      

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:14.050



00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:19.470

        But the consequences of that
        belong to a different story.
      

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:24.360

        Instead to complete the story
        of power, we need to go back
      

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:32.330

        to the turn of the
        20th century.
      

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:35.800

        Back then, the scientific theory
        of energy might have
      

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.060

        been lighting up men's minds,
        but it wasn't lighting up
      

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.010

        anyone's homes.


00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:44.410

        Not yet, at any rate.


00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:47.850

        Most people's domestic lives
        were largely unaffected by
      

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:50.290

        developments in thermodynamics
        or electromagnetism.
      

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.980



00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:58.340

        Outside there were telegraphs
        and steam trains, but at home
      

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:01.490

        there were gas lamps, candles,
        and open fires.
      

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:08.400



00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.930

        What changed our personal
        relationship with power was
      

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:14.580

        the discovery that the link
        between electricity and
      

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:19.050

        magnetism worked both ways.


00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:21.810

        Orsted had shown that an
        electrical current could act
      

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:23.060

        just like a magnet.


00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.800



00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.930

        The British scientist Michael
        Faraday was the first to
      

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:32.780

        demonstrate the opposite with
        electromagnetic induction.
      

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.290



00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:37.300

        I've got a magnet.


00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:40.780

        I've got a coil of copper wire
        going round and round.
      

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:43.700

        And what I'm going to do is make
        the magnet move through
      

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.070

        the middle of the coil.


00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:47.800



00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.800

        As I move the magnet up and
        down through the wire, the
      

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.620

        electric light flashes
        on and off.
      

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.800

        Faraday realized if you have
        the movement of the magnets
      

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.270

        through the coil, then you
        can use that to generate
      

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:02.060

        electricity.


00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:06.850

        And then you can use the
        electricity to power machines.
      

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:10.240

        This was a revolutionary
        discovery.
      

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:14.730

        In theory if the magnet could be
        moved fast enough, it would
      

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:19.150

        produce an electric current
        that was continuous.
      

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:22.060

        What was needed was something
        to move the magnet.
      

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:28.690



00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:32.300

        Something like this.


00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.180

        Niagara Falls.


00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.570

        One of the most powerful
        waterfalls in the world.
      

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:40.080



00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.280

        The challenge lay in finding a
        way of converting this massive
      

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.580

        energy into an altogether
        more useful form.
      

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:50.050



00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:53.340

        Electromagnetic conduction
        offered the promise of
      

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.590

        harnessing the power of the
        falls to produce electricity.
      

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:59.440



00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.420

        But it would require
        a colossal feat of
      

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.000

        engineering to do it.


00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.370



00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:11.650

        The project began deep
        underground.
      

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:16.210

        Tunnels were dug into solid rock
        by hand to divert some of
      

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:20.610

        those water to an electrical
        generator.
      

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:23.680

        Those taking part sensed it
        was the dawn of a new age.
      

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.380



00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:30.090

        When completed, this power
        station was described as a
      

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:34.260

        feat to rival the pyramids, the
        temples of the Greeks, and
      

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.520

        the great cathedrals
        of Europe.
      

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.100

        A monument to the
        scientific age.
      

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.660



00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:45.880

        These giant turbines are the
        ultimate expression both of
      

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:51.180

        what power is and
        what power does.
      

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:55.740

        Huge magnets turned by the
        power of falling water,
      

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:59.730

        creating enough electricity
        to power 3/4 of a million
      

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:00.980

        lightbulbs.


00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:07.220



00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:11.430

        But for electricity to become
        a commodity, something that
      

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:14.280

        could be bought and sold,
        there was one
      

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.660

        final barrier to overcome.


00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:23.290

        How to get it from Niagara to
        places where it could be sold?
      

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:26.150

        Existing power sources could
        comfortably transport
      

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:30.100

        electricity over short
        distances.
      

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:33.620

        But as it traveled further, the
        electricity's power would
      

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:36.210

        quickly diminish.


00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:39.900

        After as little as 2 miles,
        virtually no current will be
      

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.150

        getting through at all.


00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:46.160



00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.550

        Here at Niagara, this problem
        was overcome.
      

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:54.250

        Its generators produced what's
        known as alternating current
      

00:46:54.250 --> 00:47:01.870

        at high voltage and low power
        loss, which meant electricity
      

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:03.370

        could travel long distances.


00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:05.920



00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:11.880

        In November 1896, power from
        the falls were switched on.
      

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.890

        For the first time, electricity
        traveled from
      

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:22.860

        Niagara to Buffalo, more
        than 20 miles away.
      

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:26.970

        In that fleeting moment was
        born the electric age.
      

00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:30.920



00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:34.590

        The quest to discover what
        power can do has
      

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:37.640

        transformed our lives.


00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.410

        It set us on a relentless search
        for new sources of
      

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:46.610

        energy from deep within the
        Earth or inside the smallest
      

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:51.940

        atom to the sun itself, our
        hunger for more power knows
      

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.350

        few bounds.


00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:59.440

        Small wonder that our planet,
        alone in the solar system,
      

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.690

        glows in the dark.


00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:11.850



00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:15.900

        But the quest to know what power
        is has had an equally
      

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.150

        profound effect.


00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:19.950



00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:23.720

        Using the language of
        mathematics, energy has been
      

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.480

        revealed as a fundamental
        component of the universe.
      

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:30.430



00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:34.010

        But the theoretical
        understanding of energy is, in
      

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:38.340

        no small part, built on the
        earlier contributions of more
      

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:41.510

        practically minded men.


00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:46.100

        The whole of modern physics, in
        a way, rests on all those
      

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.580

        industrial innovations that were
        being made in the 19th
      

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.630

        century and which led to this
        new concept of energy.
      

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:56.410



00:48:56.410 --> 00:49:00.430

        The joint understanding of what
        power can do, and what
      

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:05.100

        power actually is, has become
        one of the driving forces of
      

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:09.470

        humanity and human exploration
        and underpins
      

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:11.530

        the modem world today.


00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:59.260
