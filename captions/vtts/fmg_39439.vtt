WEBVTT

00:00:08.965 --> 00:00:55.325


00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:25.695
FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS
HUMAN BEINGS HAVE

00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:27.825
MADE USE OF THE WOOD
FROM THEIR FORESTS.

00:01:27.825 --> 00:01:29.925
GENERATION AFTER
GENERATION THEY'VE

00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:31.995
CUT THE TREES DOWN IN
ORDER TO BUILD BOATS

00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:34.365
AND HOMES AS
WELL AS FOR FUEL.

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:38.025
IT WAS A SUSTAINABLE WAY
OF USING THIS RESOURCE.

00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:50.695
TREES WERE CUT BUT THE
FOREST WAS RENEWED.

00:01:50.695 --> 00:01:54.125
IN RECENT DECADES GLOBAL
DEFORESTATION HAS GOTTEN

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:57.995
OUT OF CONTROL WITH
NO END IN SIGHT.

00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:19.425
WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING
THE DESTRUCTION

00:02:19.425 --> 00:02:22.025
OF THE FORESTS AND
ITS CONSEQUENCES

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:23.695
FOR THREE DECADES.

00:02:23.695 --> 00:02:25.725
FOR MORE THAN THREE
DECADES WE HAVE BEEN

00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:27.895
WARNED THAT FORESTS
CONTAIN THE LARGEST

00:02:27.895 --> 00:02:29.625
BIODIVERSITY
ON THE PLANET,

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:32.695
THAT THEY PLAY A CRUCIAL
ROLE IN CLIMATE REGULATION

00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:34.865
AND THEY ARE THE
LARGEST ABSORBERS OF

00:02:34.865 --> 00:02:36.965
CARBON-BASED GASES.

00:02:36.965 --> 00:02:40.365
FORESTS PROTECT US FROM
FLOODS, REGULATE RAINFALL,

00:02:40.365 --> 00:02:45.295
AND ABATE THE
GREENHOUSE EFFECT.

00:02:45.295 --> 00:02:50.925
HOWEVER, AS WE BEGIN THE
21ST CENTURY, 75% OF OUR

00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:55.725
FORESTS HAVE DISAPPEARED
OR ARE ABOUT TO DO SO.

00:02:55.725 --> 00:02:58.295
TROPICAL RAINFORESTS IN
SOUTH AMERICA AND ASIA

00:02:58.295 --> 00:03:01.225
ARE BEING SLASHED AND
BURNED AT AN ALARMING RATE

00:03:01.225 --> 00:03:03.995
IN ORDER TO SATISFY THE
DEMANDS OF THE LUMBER

00:03:03.995 --> 00:03:06.725
AND THE FOOD
INDUSTRIES.

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:20.665
MOST VIRGIN FOREST
AREAS CAN BE FOUND IN

00:03:20.665 --> 00:03:22.965
THE AMAZON, RUSSIA,
AND CANADA

00:03:22.965 --> 00:03:25.925
BUT AT THE CURRENT
RATE OF DEFORESTATION

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:29.625
THEY WILL HARDLY MAKE
IT INTO THE NEXT DECADE.

00:03:52.195 --> 00:03:54.965
WITH EVERY YEAR THAT GOES
BY, THE RATE OF SLASHING

00:03:54.965 --> 00:03:57.465
AND CASES OF FOREST
BURNING INCREASE.

00:03:57.465 --> 00:04:00.495
DATA SUGGESTS THAT
DESTRUCTION IS ON THE RISE.

00:04:00.495 --> 00:04:02.995
WE MUST THUS
ASK OURSELVES,

00:04:02.995 --> 00:04:08.895
WHO IS DESTROYING
THE FORESTS?

00:04:13.395 --> 00:04:15.125
WHO BENEFITS FROM THIS?

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:17.325
WHY ISN'T IT
BEING STOPPED?

00:04:17.325 --> 00:04:23.025
AND ABOVE ALL, WHAT
CAN WE DO TO AVOID IT?

00:05:19.865 --> 00:05:22.895
DEFORESTATION AND THE
EXPLOITATION OF FORESTS

00:05:22.895 --> 00:05:27.665
HAVE A LONG HISTORY, AS OLD
AS THE HISTORY OF MANKIND.

00:05:27.665 --> 00:05:30.025
ALTHOUGH TODAY
DEFORESTATION IS

00:05:30.025 --> 00:05:32.525
CONSIDERED A PROBLEM, IT
USED TO BE CONSIDERED

00:05:32.525 --> 00:05:34.465
A SOURCE OF DEVELOPMENT.

00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:37.795
UNTIL JUST A FEW DECADES
AGO FORESTS WERE

00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:41.295
CONSIDERED DARK AREAS
INHABITED BY EVIL SPIRITS

00:05:41.295 --> 00:05:47.725
THAT DESERVED ONLY
TO BE EXPELLED.

00:05:47.725 --> 00:05:52.495
QUITE OFTEN COMMUNITIES
HAVE THOUGHT OF FORESTS AS

00:05:52.495 --> 00:05:55.625
BEING QUITE MENACING,
POPULATED BY DEMONS,

00:05:55.625 --> 00:06:00.425
SORCERERS, AND
DANGEROUS ANIMALS.

00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:02.725
THE ROOT OF THE
WORD "FOREST"

00:06:02.725 --> 00:06:04.665
CONTAINS THE
PREFIX "FOR"

00:06:04.665 --> 00:06:07.295
WHICH IN MANY INDO-EUROPEAN
LANGUAGES MEANS

00:06:07.295 --> 00:06:10.465
"THAT WHICH IS FOREIGN",
"WHAT IS OUT OF USE",

00:06:10.465 --> 00:06:13.465
WITH ALL THE LACK OF
TRUST ATTRIBUTED TO

00:06:13.465 --> 00:06:17.495
PEOPLE AND THINGS THAT
ARE UNFAMILIAR TO US.

00:06:24.025 --> 00:06:26.625
IN INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS
THAT HAVE FORESTS,

00:06:26.625 --> 00:06:30.025
MANY USE THE EXPRESSION
"FOREST PULL", WHICH REFERS

00:06:30.025 --> 00:06:32.165
TO THE PHYSICAL AND
PSYCHIC PRESSURE

00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:42.295
THAT THE FOREST EXERTS
ON ITS INHABITANTS.

00:06:42.295 --> 00:06:45.365
TODAY FORESTS ARE
PERCEIVED BY PART OF THE

00:06:45.365 --> 00:06:48.025
URBAN POPULATION OF
INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS

00:06:48.025 --> 00:06:51.925
AS ONE OF THE LAST REFUGES
OF TRUE NATURE - ESPECIALLY

00:06:51.925 --> 00:06:55.825
THOSE FORESTS THAT HAVE
BARELY BEEN TOUCHED BY MAN.

00:06:55.825 --> 00:06:59.165
THEY'RE ONE OF THE LINKS
THAT JOIN MAN TO THE WORLD

00:06:59.165 --> 00:07:02.295
OF THE UNTOUCHED, THE
PRIMEVAL, A WORLD IN WHICH

00:07:02.295 --> 00:07:04.995
SMALL GROUPS OF PEOPLE
LIVED OFF THE LAND

00:07:04.995 --> 00:07:07.495
WITH AN EYE ON MAINTAINING
THEIR SURROUNDINGS

00:07:07.495 --> 00:07:09.725
BY HUNTING AND GATHERING
THOSE PRODUCTS

00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:16.725
THEY NEEDED IN
ORDER TO SUBSIST.

00:07:16.725 --> 00:07:19.325
FROM THE TIME OF THE
ROMANS UNTIL AFTER

00:07:19.325 --> 00:07:21.925
WORLD WAR II, THE
CUTTING DOWN OF FORESTS

00:07:21.925 --> 00:07:24.625
WAS CONSIDERED A
SIGN OF PROGRESS.

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:27.165
THEIR DISAPPEARANCE WAS
EQUATED TO PRODUCTION

00:07:27.165 --> 00:07:32.465
OF NEW BOATS, RAW
MATERIALS, AND ENERGY.

00:07:32.465 --> 00:07:36.665
CLIMATE CHANGES DUE TO
DEFORESTATION WERE ALREADY

00:07:36.665 --> 00:07:39.595
A PREOCCUPATION OF ROMAN
AUTHORITIES WHO WERE

00:07:39.595 --> 00:07:42.325
AWARE OF NORTHBOUND
ADVANCES OF THE DESERT

00:07:42.325 --> 00:07:45.965
IN PRESENT DAY TUNISIA,
ALGERIA AND LIBYA.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.165
BACK THEN THE CLIMATE
WAS MUCH MORE HUMID

00:07:48.165 --> 00:07:50.695
WHICH ENABLED FARMERS
TO GROW WHEAT.

00:07:50.695 --> 00:07:53.295
THIS REGION, WHICH TODAY
IS PRACTICALLY A DESERT,

00:07:53.295 --> 00:07:59.625
WAS ONCE THE BREADBASKET
OF THE EMPIRE.

00:07:59.625 --> 00:08:02.525
THE CANARY ISLANDS ALSO
SUFFERED FROM DRASTIC

00:08:02.525 --> 00:08:06.325
CLIMATE CHANGES BEFORE
THE INDUSTRIAL ERA.

00:08:06.325 --> 00:08:09.625
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS IN
THE LOG BOOK OF HIS MAIDEN

00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:13.865
VOYAGE COMMENTED IN 1492
ON HOW MUCH THE FORESTS ON

00:08:13.865 --> 00:08:16.465
THE ISLANDS HAD SUFFERED
SINCE THE ARRIVAL

00:08:16.465 --> 00:08:19.295
OF BETANCOURT
50 YEARS EARLIER.

00:08:19.295 --> 00:08:21.595
BECAUSE IT WAS ALREADY
ALMOST A DESERT,

00:08:21.595 --> 00:08:23.865
THE HUMIDITY FROM THE
ATLANTIC COULD NO LONGER

00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:27.465
CONDENSE TO
FORM RAINFALL.

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:30.325
AS THE MIDDLE
AGES APPROACHED,

00:08:30.325 --> 00:08:34.025
EUROPE BOASTED A DENSE
POPULATION OF TREES.

00:08:34.025 --> 00:08:37.025
BY THE TENTH CENTURY MANY
OF THE FORESTS HAD ALREADY

00:08:37.025 --> 00:08:39.395
DISAPPEARED AND MOST OF
THE ONES THAT WERE LEFT

00:08:39.395 --> 00:08:44.265
WERE BEING REPLACED BY
FARMS AND PASTURES.

00:08:44.265 --> 00:08:46.265
FAR FROM EUROPE,
DEFORESTATION

00:08:46.265 --> 00:08:48.795
HAD ITS BEGINNINGS
IN THE COLONIAL ERA.

00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:52.025
TROPICAL RAINFORESTS
HAVE BEEN INHABITED

00:08:52.025 --> 00:08:54.825
FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS
BY NUMEROUS COMMUNITIES

00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:57.965
THAT USED THEIR RESOURCES
IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS

00:08:57.965 --> 00:09:00.465
- EVEN IN AGRICULTURE.

00:09:00.465 --> 00:09:02.725
IT WAS A TYPE OF
AGRICULTURE THAT HELPED

00:09:02.725 --> 00:09:04.865
MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY
OF THE FORESTS

00:09:04.865 --> 00:09:08.265
WITHOUT
DESTROYING THEM.

00:09:08.265 --> 00:09:10.965
THE BOOM OF COLONIAL
ECONOMIES BROKE THIS

00:09:10.965 --> 00:09:14.225
PATTERN, THUS THE
COLONIZED TERRITORIES

00:09:14.225 --> 00:09:17.425
WERE ABSORBED BY
THE WORLD MARKET.

00:09:17.425 --> 00:09:21.095
BE IT IN AMERICA, ASIA, OR
AFRICA, THE COMMON GOAL OF

00:09:21.095 --> 00:09:23.865
COLONIZERS WAS TO
ESTABLISH SELF-SUFFICIENT

00:09:23.865 --> 00:09:26.225
COMMUNITIES IN
AGRICULTURAL AREAS

00:09:26.225 --> 00:09:29.265
FOR THE PURPOSES
OF EXPORT.

00:09:29.265 --> 00:09:31.525
THEIR INTENTION WAS
TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE

00:09:31.525 --> 00:09:33.825
OF RESOURCES AT
THE LOWEST COST

00:09:33.825 --> 00:09:36.165
WITHOUT CONSIDERING
THE ECOSYSTEM.

00:09:36.165 --> 00:09:38.425
THUS A SYSTEM BASED
ON CROP ROTATION

00:09:38.425 --> 00:09:40.725
AND THE USE OF FORAGE
WAS IMPLEMENTED

00:09:40.725 --> 00:09:47.825
ALONG WITH EXTENSIVE
CATTLE RANCHING.

00:09:47.825 --> 00:09:50.225
WHEN THE COLONIES
GOT THEIR POLITICAL

00:09:50.225 --> 00:09:53.365
INDEPENDENCE, THIS MODEL
DID NOT CHANGE AS THE

00:09:53.365 --> 00:09:55.795
NEW NATIONS WERE STILL
ECONOMICALLY DEPENDENT

00:09:55.795 --> 00:10:01.065
ON MARKETS DOMINATED
BY COLONIZING NATIONS.

00:10:01.065 --> 00:10:03.595
THE POWERS THAT WERE,
IN CONJUNCTION WITH

00:10:03.595 --> 00:10:05.995
INTERNATIONAL
COMMERCE REGULATORS,

00:10:05.995 --> 00:10:08.825
CONTINUED THIS PATTERN WELL
INTO THE 20TH CENTURY,

00:10:08.825 --> 00:10:11.995
THUS CREATING INSTABILITY,
POVERTY, AND PROVOKING

00:10:11.995 --> 00:10:14.395
THE PROGRESSIVE DEGRADATION
OF THE ENVIRONMENT

00:10:14.395 --> 00:10:17.665
IN SO-CALLED "THIRD
WORLD" NATIONS.

00:10:17.665 --> 00:10:19.995
A KEY MOMENT IN THE
INTENSIVE PROCESS

00:10:19.995 --> 00:10:22.225
OF DEFORESTATION WAS
THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:10:22.225 --> 00:10:24.565
OF THE SO-CALLED
"GREEN REVOLUTION".

00:10:24.565 --> 00:10:27.925
IN 1944 THE ROCKEFELLER
FOUNDATION FINANCED THE

00:10:27.925 --> 00:10:30.665
IMPLEMENTATION OF A
SERIES OF TECHNOLOGICAL

00:10:30.665 --> 00:10:33.795
IMPROVEMENTS FOR MEXICAN
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.

00:10:33.795 --> 00:10:36.265
THIS GAVE BIRTH TO THE
MODEL OF AGRICULTURAL

00:10:36.265 --> 00:10:38.465
PRODUCTION KNOWN AS THE
GREEN REVOLUTION IN WHICH

00:10:38.465 --> 00:10:40.865
HIGH YIELDING CROPS
WERE DEVELOPED BY USING

00:10:40.865 --> 00:10:43.295
VERY TECHNICALLY
ADVANCED MONOCULTURE,

00:10:43.295 --> 00:10:46.165
BASED ON IRRIGATION,
CHEMICAL FERTILIZATION

00:10:46.165 --> 00:10:50.825
AND PESTICIDES.

00:10:50.825 --> 00:10:53.525
THROUGHOUT THE SIXTIES
AND SEVENTIES THOSE

00:10:53.525 --> 00:10:56.395
TECHNOLOGIES EXPANDED
THROUGHOUT THE PLANET.

00:10:56.395 --> 00:10:59.165
THEY WERE QUITE EFFECTIVE
IN HELPING TO REDUCE

00:10:59.165 --> 00:11:01.195
HUNGER IN SOME
REGIONS OF THE WORLD,

00:11:01.195 --> 00:11:04.595
ESPECIALLY IN ASIA
AND IN LATIN AMERICA.

00:11:04.595 --> 00:11:07.095
HOWEVER, THE APPLICATION
OF THIS MODEL HAD

00:11:07.095 --> 00:11:09.795
NEFARIOUS CONSEQUENCES
FOR FORESTS.

00:11:09.795 --> 00:11:12.165
THESE WERE SUBSTITUTED
BY VAST AREAS

00:11:12.165 --> 00:11:17.595
FOR LARGE SCALE
INDUSTRIAL MONOCULTURE.

00:11:17.595 --> 00:11:20.365
THE GREEN REVOLUTION
PARTIALLY SOLVED THE

00:11:20.365 --> 00:11:22.925
PROBLEM OF HUNGER IN
SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD

00:11:22.925 --> 00:11:25.965
BUT ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE
LOSS OF LIFE-SUSTAINING

00:11:25.965 --> 00:11:28.265
RESOURCES OF RURAL
COMMUNITIES AND TO THEIR

00:11:28.265 --> 00:11:32.395
MASS EMIGRATION
TO LARGE CITIES.

00:13:19.725 --> 00:13:23.525
WHO IS REALLY RESPONSIBLE
FOR DEFORESTATION?

00:13:23.525 --> 00:13:26.325
WHILE THE GREEN REVOLUTION
WAS BEING IMPLEMENTED

00:13:26.325 --> 00:13:28.825
SOME EXPERTS AGREED THAT
ONE OF THE MAIN CAUSES

00:13:28.825 --> 00:13:31.295
OF DEFORESTATION
WAS THE WAY IN WHICH

00:13:31.295 --> 00:13:33.525
POOR FARMERS
USED LUMBER.

00:13:33.525 --> 00:13:36.765
THIS IS FALSE.

00:13:36.765 --> 00:13:39.395
WHILE THESE EXPERTS DID
THEIR JOBS BY EXPOUNDING

00:13:39.395 --> 00:13:42.125
THESE THEORIES, THE TRUE
CAUSANTS OF DESTRUCTION

00:13:42.125 --> 00:13:44.565
ALSO DID THEIRS.

00:13:44.565 --> 00:13:46.825
THE RESPONSIBILITY
FALLS SQUARELY ON

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:49.325
LUMBER COMPANIES THAT CUT
TREES ON A GRAND SCALE

00:13:49.325 --> 00:13:51.625
BOTH ILLEGALLY
AND LEGALLY.

00:13:51.625 --> 00:13:54.065
EXPORT CROPS AND
EXTENSIVE CATTLE FARMING

00:13:54.065 --> 00:13:57.065
ARE ALSO TO BLAME WHICH
DEMAND THE CLEANING OUT

00:13:57.065 --> 00:13:59.765
OF MORE AND MORE ACRES
OF FOREST EACH YEAR.

00:13:59.765 --> 00:14:01.695
OTHER AGENTS OF
DESTRUCTION ARE

00:14:01.695 --> 00:14:04.165
INDUSTRIAL PLANTATIONS
FOR CELLULOSE, WOOD,

00:14:04.165 --> 00:14:06.325
AND OIL PALM TREES
WHICH ARE SUBSTITUTING

00:14:06.325 --> 00:14:08.795
VAST AREAS OF
DIVERSITY-RICH FOREST

00:14:08.795 --> 00:14:12.325
FOR THE MONOCULTURE
OF EXOTIC SPECIES.

00:14:12.325 --> 00:14:15.365
AS WELL AS MINING AND OIL
COMPANIES WHICH CONTINUE

00:14:15.365 --> 00:14:17.695
TO PRODUCE WITHOUT
CONSIDERING THE

00:14:17.695 --> 00:14:22.295
DESTRUCTION AND
CONTAMINATION OF FORESTS.

00:14:33.625 --> 00:14:37.065
ALL OF THESE PROCESSES
HAVE A GRAVE IMPACT

00:14:37.065 --> 00:14:39.095
BOTH LOCALLY
AND GLOBALLY.

00:14:39.095 --> 00:14:41.295
DEFORESTATION
HAS CREATED POVERTY

00:14:41.295 --> 00:14:43.295
AND HAS ENHANCED
THE CONSEQUENCES

00:14:43.295 --> 00:14:49.665
OF FLOODING AND
NATURAL DISASTERS.

00:14:49.665 --> 00:14:52.965
AMPLE AREAS IN AMERICA,
AFRICA, AND ASIA HAVE

00:14:52.965 --> 00:14:55.565
LOST A GREAT DEAL OF
THEIR NATURAL ECOSYSTEM

00:14:55.565 --> 00:14:57.765
IN THE LAST
THREE DECADES.

00:14:57.765 --> 00:14:59.225
AND ALL FOR WHAT?

00:14:59.225 --> 00:15:01.995
WHAT HAVE THEY
ACHIEVED IN EXCHANGE?

00:15:01.995 --> 00:15:04.065
HAVE THEY SOLVED THE
PROBLEMS OF POVERTY,

00:15:04.065 --> 00:15:05.965
EDUCATION, AND
UNDERDEVELOPMENT?

00:15:05.965 --> 00:15:07.395
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

00:15:07.395 --> 00:15:09.865
WHAT'S WORSE, THEY'VE
AGGRAVATED THEM.

00:15:09.865 --> 00:15:12.765
THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT DATA
FROM THE UNITED NATIONS

00:15:12.765 --> 00:15:15.125
SHOWS THAT IN THESE
COUNTRIES DURING THIS TIME

00:15:15.125 --> 00:15:18.165
INEQUALITY AND POVERTY
HAVE INCREASED.

00:15:18.165 --> 00:15:20.365
WHO BENEFITS
FROM THIS?

00:15:20.365 --> 00:15:22.895
AND WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE DEFORESTATION

00:15:22.895 --> 00:15:26.765
AND DEGRADATION
OF OUR PLANET?

00:15:26.765 --> 00:15:29.465
THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO
BELIEVE IN A SOCIETY

00:15:29.465 --> 00:15:31.865
WITHOUT CONSUMER LIMITS,
IN A SYSTEM THAT NEEDS

00:15:31.865 --> 00:15:34.765
VERY CHEAP RAW MATERIALS -
WOOD, OIL, AND MINERALS

00:15:34.765 --> 00:15:37.595
- IN ORDER TO CREATE
EVER INCREASING DEMAND;

00:15:37.595 --> 00:15:40.395
A CONSUMER CULTURE THAT
ENCOURAGES US TO CHANGE

00:15:40.395 --> 00:15:43.025
CELL PHONES AND COMPUTERS
EVERY SIX MONTHS;

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:45.795
A CULTURE OF WASTE,
ACCUMULATION,

00:15:45.795 --> 00:15:49.525
AND UNCONTROLLED AND
LIMITLESS GROWTH.

00:16:00.265 --> 00:16:03.065
THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE,
AND JAPAN, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:16:03.065 --> 00:16:05.525
SUSTAIN THEIR ECONOMIES
ON THE PRINCIPLE OF

00:16:05.525 --> 00:16:07.695
"BUY MORE AND
PAY LESS".

00:16:07.695 --> 00:16:10.425
THIS IS ONLY VIABLE WHEN
ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF RAW

00:16:10.425 --> 00:16:14.725
MATERIALS ARE PURCHASED AT
RIDICULOUSLY LOW PRICES.

00:16:14.725 --> 00:16:17.865
GUATEMALA, SENEGAL, AND
BRAZIL ON THE OTHER END

00:16:17.865 --> 00:16:20.525
OF THE SCALE ARE FORCED
BY THE INTERNATIONAL

00:16:20.525 --> 00:16:22.965
MONETARY FUND AND
WORLD DEVELOPMENT BANKS

00:16:22.965 --> 00:16:25.625
TO BASE THEIR
ECONOMIES ON MONOCULTURE

00:16:25.625 --> 00:16:28.795
IN ORDER TO SATISFY THIS
DEMAND FOR RAW MATERIALS.

00:16:28.795 --> 00:16:32.225
BUT ON THE SIDELINES,
INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS

00:16:32.225 --> 00:16:34.025
LOSE THEIR LANDS,

00:16:34.025 --> 00:16:36.395
FORESTS DISAPPEAR
AND WORKERS ON LARGE

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:38.225
PLANTATIONS ARE
FORCED TO ACCEPT

00:16:38.225 --> 00:16:40.765
SLAVE-LIKE
WORK CONDITIONS.

00:16:40.765 --> 00:16:43.325
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THE
PRICE AND CONSUMPTION

00:16:43.325 --> 00:16:45.995
LEVELS IN THE UNITED
STATES, EUROPE, AND JAPAN

00:16:45.995 --> 00:16:48.165
CAN BE MAINTAINED.

00:16:48.165 --> 00:16:50.595
THIS IS THE VICIOUS
CIRCLE OF THE SYSTEM

00:16:50.595 --> 00:16:54.365
OF UNSUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENT.

00:17:07.525 --> 00:17:09.465
THE AMAZON IS
A CLEAR EXAMPLE

00:17:09.465 --> 00:17:11.125
OF WHAT WAS
JUST EXPLAINED.

00:17:11.125 --> 00:17:13.365
IT IS THE LARGEST
FOREST IN THE WORLD,

00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:15.565
THE "GREAT LUNG"
OF THE EARTH.

00:17:15.565 --> 00:17:17.825
THE AIR THAT
HUMANITY BREATHES IN

00:17:17.825 --> 00:17:20.965
IS PURIFIED MAINLY IN
THE AMAZON RAINFOREST.

00:17:20.965 --> 00:17:23.325
BUT THE PACE OF
ITS DESTRUCTION

00:17:23.325 --> 00:17:26.925
IS BREATHTAKING AND HAS
NOT REMITTED SINCE 1970.

00:17:26.925 --> 00:17:29.265
UNTIL THAT YEAR,
IN ALL ITS HISTORY

00:17:29.265 --> 00:17:32.525
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF ITS
ORIGINAL AREA WAS LOST.

00:17:32.525 --> 00:17:34.895
IN THREE DECADES
THE DESTRUCTION RATE

00:17:34.895 --> 00:17:37.295
WAS ACCELERATED, AND
BY THE YEAR 2000,

00:17:37.295 --> 00:17:41.195
15% OF IT HAD
DISAPPEARED.

00:17:41.195 --> 00:17:43.995
IN THE AMAZON THE
PROCESS OF DEFORESTATION

00:17:43.995 --> 00:17:46.665
USUALLY BEGINS WITH THE
CONSTRUCTION OF A ROAD.

00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:49.665
PERHAPS THE MOST FAMOUS
OF SUCH ROADS IS THE

00:17:49.665 --> 00:17:52.495
TRANS-AMAZON ROUTE,
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY

00:17:52.495 --> 00:17:55.665
MORE IN THE REGION THAT
HEAD IN EVERY DIRECTION.

00:17:55.665 --> 00:17:58.525
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A
ROAD NECESSITATES THE

00:17:58.525 --> 00:18:01.265
CLEARING AWAY OF HUNDREDS
OF KILOMETERS OF FORESTS

00:18:01.265 --> 00:18:03.695
AND CREATES THE
NECESSARY ACCESS

00:18:03.695 --> 00:18:07.625
FOR THOSE WHO CONTINUE
THE DESTRUCTION PROCESS.

00:18:07.625 --> 00:18:10.365
WOOD COMPANIES ARE THE
MAIN CULPRITS, WORKING

00:18:10.365 --> 00:18:13.025
BOTH WITH LEGAL PERMITS
AND IN CLANDESTINE

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:16.465
OPERATIONS IN CAHOOTS
WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

00:18:16.465 --> 00:18:20.325
THE STATE SPONSORED
NETWORK OF ROADS HAS

00:18:20.325 --> 00:18:23.525
ENABLED BROSSI, FOR
EXAMPLE, TO INCREASE

00:18:23.525 --> 00:18:28.595
ITS LUMBER OUTPUT BY 85%
OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES.

00:18:28.595 --> 00:18:31.365
LATELY WE HAVE ALSO
WITNESSED THE INFLUX

00:18:31.365 --> 00:18:33.895
OF LARGE AMERICAN,
GERMAN, AND JAPANESE

00:18:33.895 --> 00:18:37.225
TRANSNATIONAL INDUSTRIES
UNDER THE AUSPICES

00:18:37.225 --> 00:18:40.025
OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.

00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:04.125
THE PROCESS OF
DEFORESTATION

00:19:04.125 --> 00:19:06.595
FOLLOWS A PATTERN
THAT CAN BE SUMMARIZED

00:19:06.595 --> 00:19:08.725
IN THE FOLLOWING WAY:

00:19:08.725 --> 00:19:11.295
A ROAD OR PATH IS CLEARED
THAT IS ALMOST ALWAYS

00:19:11.295 --> 00:19:14.495
ASSOCIATED WITH SOME KIND
OF INDUSTRIAL EXPLOITATION.

00:19:14.495 --> 00:19:16.795
AFTERWARDS FARMERS
ARE BROUGHT IN

00:19:16.795 --> 00:19:19.025
TO CLEAR AN AREA THAT
HAS BEEN SLASHED

00:19:19.025 --> 00:19:21.565
OF THE FEW TREES AND
STUMPS LEFT STANDING.

00:19:21.565 --> 00:19:23.665
THE AREA IS
THEN BURNED

00:19:23.665 --> 00:19:26.465
AND CONSECRATED TO
SUBSISTENCE FARMING.

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:30.965
THE SOIL OF THE HUMID
JUNGLE IS VERY INFERTILE.

00:19:30.965 --> 00:19:35.065
AFTER JUST A FEW YEARS THE
GROUND LOSES ITS CAPACITY

00:19:35.065 --> 00:19:38.495
FOR GROWTH AND FARMERS ARE
DISPLACED TO OTHER AREAS

00:19:38.495 --> 00:19:41.725
WHERE THE SAME
PATTERN IS REPEATED.

00:19:41.725 --> 00:19:44.625
THE IMPOVERISHED SOIL
THAT IS LEFT BEHIND

00:19:44.625 --> 00:19:48.665
IS USED BY CATTLE RANCHERS,
THUS CREATING DEAD LAND

00:19:48.665 --> 00:19:51.265
SUBJECT TO FLOODING
AND WITH ALMOST

00:19:51.265 --> 00:19:54.395
NO CHANCE OF
BEING REGENERATED.

00:20:40.895 --> 00:20:43.665
IN BRAZIL AS WELL AS IN
THE REST OF THE LATIN

00:20:43.665 --> 00:20:45.525
AMERICAN COUNTRIES THAT
HAVE LARGE FORESTS,

00:20:45.525 --> 00:20:47.725
THESE HAVE SERVED
AS AN ESCAPE VALVE

00:20:47.725 --> 00:20:50.265
TO QUELL POTENTIAL
SOCIAL REVOLT.

00:20:50.265 --> 00:20:54.325
THE CONCENTRATION OF POWER
AND LAND IN THE HANDS OF

00:20:54.325 --> 00:20:57.365
SO FEW HAVE GIVEN
RISE TO THE LARGE

00:20:57.365 --> 00:21:00.265
DISPOSSESSED MASSES
CAPABLE OF ORGANIZING

00:21:00.265 --> 00:21:04.425
UPRISINGS AGAINST THE STATE
AND DE-FACTO POWERS.

00:21:04.425 --> 00:21:07.425
IN ORDER TO AVOID THIS,
BEGINNING IN THE 1970'S

00:21:07.425 --> 00:21:09.595
THEY WERE GIVEN THE
CHANCE TO FREELY ACCESS

00:21:09.595 --> 00:21:11.795
PORTIONS OF
FOREST LAND.

00:21:11.795 --> 00:21:13.895
THE CONSEQUENCES
WERE PREDICTABLE -

00:21:13.895 --> 00:21:15.965
THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE FOREST

00:21:15.965 --> 00:21:18.065
AND FURTHER
IMPOVERISHMENT OF FARMERS.

00:21:18.065 --> 00:21:20.095
BUT WHAT WAS MOST
URGENT WAS TO FIND AN

00:21:20.095 --> 00:21:23.165
ESCAPE VALVE FOR
POTENTIAL INSURRECTION.

00:21:23.165 --> 00:21:25.695
THE BRAZILIAN AND OTHER
LATIN AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS

00:21:25.695 --> 00:21:28.165
INSIST ON CONTINUING
THIS PATTERN WHICH

00:21:28.165 --> 00:21:30.795
IN THE LAST YEARS HAS
BEEN GREATLY AGGRAVATED

00:21:30.795 --> 00:21:35.295
WITH NEW PLANTATIONS
OF SOY AND OIL PALM.

00:22:28.365 --> 00:22:31.525
IN INDONESIA AND MALAYSIA
AS WELL AS IN BRAZIL THE

00:22:31.525 --> 00:22:34.565
PRODUCTION OF SOY AND OIL
PALM HAS DONE AWAY WITH

00:22:34.565 --> 00:22:37.465
MILLIONS OF HECTARES OF
TROPICAL RAINFOREST.

00:22:37.465 --> 00:22:39.865
IN INDONESIA ALONE
TWO MILLION HECTARES

00:22:39.865 --> 00:22:41.865
HAVE BEEN
CLEARED AWAY.

00:22:41.865 --> 00:22:45.765
OIL PALM IS ORIGINALLY
FROM CENTRAL AFRICA

00:22:45.765 --> 00:22:48.195
WHERE IT IS THE
BASIC CROP FOR

00:22:48.195 --> 00:22:52.165
THE SUSTENANCE
OF SMALL FARMERS.

00:22:52.165 --> 00:22:55.695
BUT IN OTHER CORNERS OF
THE WORLD IT HAS BECOME

00:22:55.695 --> 00:23:06.925
BIG BUSINESS WITH LITTLE
REGARD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:23:06.925 --> 00:23:11.065
PALM OIL IS THE SECOND MOST
CONSUMED OIL IN THE WORLD

00:23:11.065 --> 00:23:14.095
AFTER SOYBEAN OIL AND IT IS
USED IN A BEVY OF PRODUCTS

00:23:14.095 --> 00:23:16.425
FROM SHAMPOOS
TO FRENCH FRIES,

00:23:16.425 --> 00:23:20.865
COSMETICS, AND
FROZEN FOODS.

00:23:20.865 --> 00:23:23.865
COMMERCIAL PLANTATIONS
OF OIL PALM HAVE SPREAD

00:23:23.865 --> 00:23:26.495
THROUGHOUT THE TROPICS,
ESPECIALLY IN ASIA AND

00:23:26.495 --> 00:23:29.295
PARTICULARLY IN INDONESIA
AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA

00:23:29.295 --> 00:23:31.425
WHERE THEY ARE
THE MAIN CAUSE

00:23:31.425 --> 00:23:35.225
OF THE DESTRUCTION OF
TROPICAL RAINFORESTS.

00:23:35.225 --> 00:23:39.365
THESE PLANTATIONS ARE
USUALLY ESTABLISHED

00:23:39.365 --> 00:23:42.425
IN FIELDS THAT HAVE
BEEN CLEARED OF PRIMARY

00:23:42.425 --> 00:23:45.565
OR SECONDARY
JUNGLE BY BURNING.

00:23:45.565 --> 00:23:48.325
THE DESIRE TO ESTABLISH
THESE PLANTATIONS WAS

00:23:48.325 --> 00:23:50.995
PART OF THE REASON FOR
THE OUT-OF-CONTROL FIRES

00:23:50.995 --> 00:23:59.795
THAT DEVASTATED RAINFORESTS
IN INDONESIA IN 1997.

00:23:59.795 --> 00:24:02.965
THESE FIRES AND THE
COMPANIES THAT STARTED

00:24:02.965 --> 00:24:05.865
THEM ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE HUNDREDS OF

00:24:05.865 --> 00:24:08.995
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HAD
TO BE DISPLACED TO THE

00:24:08.995 --> 00:24:19.965
GHETTOS OF LARGE CITIES
WHILE FLEEING THEIR LANDS.

00:24:19.965 --> 00:24:23.095
A SINGLE PLANTATION
OF PALM OIL REQUIRES

00:24:23.095 --> 00:24:26.165
A VAST AREA IF IT IS
TO PRODUCE BENEFITS.

00:24:26.165 --> 00:24:28.765
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA EVERY
PALM PRODUCING COMPANY

00:24:28.765 --> 00:24:32.725
HAS AN AVERAGE OF
10,000 TO 25,000 HECTARES

00:24:32.725 --> 00:24:37.665
AND THE SAME OCCURS WITH
SOYBEAN PLANTATIONS.

00:25:12.925 --> 00:25:16.225
AS WE DIVE INTO THE 21ST
CENTURY, DEFORESTATION

00:25:16.225 --> 00:25:19.425
RATES IN THE AMAZON
ARE INCREASING YEARLY.

00:25:19.425 --> 00:25:22.095
THE MAIN CAUSE OF THIS IS
THE PRESSURE TO CLEAR AWAY

00:25:22.095 --> 00:25:26.865
FOREST LAND FOR THE
FARMING OF SOYBEANS.

00:25:26.865 --> 00:25:29.665
THE PRODUCTION OF MEAT
IN EUROPE IS HIGHLY

00:25:29.665 --> 00:25:32.625
SUBSIDIZED AND REQUIRES A
MASSIVE SUPPLY OF CEREAL

00:25:32.625 --> 00:25:34.295
TO FEED CATTLE.

00:25:34.295 --> 00:25:36.565
SOYBEAN IS ONE OF
THE RAW MATERIALS

00:25:36.565 --> 00:25:40.165
OF THAT CHAIN
OF PRODUCTION.

00:25:40.165 --> 00:25:47.125
BUT WHO IS HIDING BEHIND
THIS DEVASTATION?

00:25:47.125 --> 00:25:51.025
SOYBEAN COMMERCE AND
PROCESSING IS AN INDUSTRY

00:25:51.025 --> 00:25:53.495
DOMINATED BY A
SMALL NUMBER OF LARGE

00:25:53.495 --> 00:25:55.725
INTERNATIONAL
COMPANIES THAT CONTROL

00:25:55.725 --> 00:25:58.065
THE BUSINESS OF
BASIC COMMODITIES

00:25:58.065 --> 00:26:00.425
IN THE UNITED
STATES AND EUROPE.

00:26:00.425 --> 00:26:03.165
THESE COMPANIES ARE
FINANCED AND SOMETIMES

00:26:03.165 --> 00:26:06.325
EVEN SUBSIDIZED BY
STATE GOVERNMENTS AND BY

00:26:06.325 --> 00:26:09.325
FINANCIAL ORGANIZATIONS
SUCH AS THE WORLD BANK

00:26:09.325 --> 00:26:15.895
AND THE INTERNATIONAL
MONETARY FUND.

00:26:15.895 --> 00:26:21.325
THESE INSTITUTIONS FORCE
POOR COUNTRIES - PRECISELY

00:26:21.325 --> 00:26:25.025
THE ONES THAT SUPPLY THEM
WITH CHEAP RAW MATERIALS

00:26:25.025 --> 00:26:27.325
- TO LIBERALIZE
THEIR ECONOMIES.

00:26:27.325 --> 00:26:29.965
THEY'RE FORCED TO
ELIMINATE THEIR TARIFF

00:26:29.965 --> 00:26:33.465
BARRIERS AND TO REDUCE
STATE SPENDING TO CREATE

00:26:33.465 --> 00:26:36.025
THE NECESSARY LEGAL AND
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

00:26:36.025 --> 00:26:38.825
SO THAT THE LARGE
MULTINATIONALS CAN ACT

00:26:38.825 --> 00:26:41.725
WITH IMPUNITY WITHOUT ANY
REGARD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

00:26:41.725 --> 00:26:47.365
OR THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS.

00:27:01.595 --> 00:27:04.865
THOUGH PARADOXICAL, LARGE
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

00:27:04.865 --> 00:27:07.725
ARE KEY PLAYERS IN THE
PROCESS OF DEFORESTATION

00:27:07.725 --> 00:27:14.165
AND THE IMPOVERISHMENT
OF DEVELOPING NATIONS.

00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:17.765
THE PROGRAMS PROPOSED BY THE
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND,

00:27:17.765 --> 00:27:20.495
THE WORLD BANK, AND THE
WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION

00:27:20.495 --> 00:27:23.195
SUPPORT AND LAUNCH MACRO
ECONOMIC STRATEGIES

00:27:23.195 --> 00:27:25.725
DESIGNED TO PRODUCE
IMMEDIATE RETURNS

00:27:25.725 --> 00:27:28.665
INSTEAD OF LONG TERM
SUSTAINABILITY.

00:27:28.665 --> 00:27:31.295
THEIR POLICIES HAVE
LED TO THE DEGRADATION

00:27:31.295 --> 00:27:33.925
OF FORESTS, TO DIRE
SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES,

00:27:33.925 --> 00:27:37.225
AND TO GENERAL
IMPOVERISHMENT.

00:27:37.225 --> 00:27:39.395
MORE PEOPLE DIE IN
THE WORLD DUE TO

00:27:39.395 --> 00:27:41.995
WORK CONDITIONS ON
PLANTATIONS OWNED BY

00:27:41.995 --> 00:27:45.795
LARGE CORPORATIONS THAN TO
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.

00:27:45.795 --> 00:27:50.525
THIS IS TRULY A
GLOBAL PROBLEM.

00:29:20.665 --> 00:29:23.295
BANANA PLANTATIONS
DID TO THE FORESTS

00:29:23.295 --> 00:29:26.265
IN THE 20TH CENTURY WHAT
SOYBEAN AND OIL PALM

00:29:26.265 --> 00:29:28.365
HAVE DONE IN
RECENT YEARS.

00:29:28.365 --> 00:29:31.195
THE FORESTS OF CENTRAL
AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN

00:29:31.195 --> 00:29:33.695
WERE DECIMATED
BY MULTINATIONALS

00:29:33.695 --> 00:29:35.895
THAT SPECIALIZED
IN DEVASTATION.

00:29:35.895 --> 00:29:38.425
THEY WERE THE FIRST
AND ARE STILL AT

00:29:38.425 --> 00:29:44.195
THE TOP OF THEIR CLASS
IN THIS SINISTER RANKING.

00:29:44.195 --> 00:29:47.565
IN TERMS OF GROSS VALUE OF
PRODUCTION, BANANA IS

00:29:47.565 --> 00:29:50.265
THE FOURTH MOST IMPORTANT
CROP IN THE WORLD,

00:29:50.265 --> 00:29:54.395
AFTER RICE,
WHEAT, AND CORN.

00:29:54.395 --> 00:29:57.295
LATIN AMERICA DOMINATES
THE WORLD BANANA INDUSTRY

00:29:57.295 --> 00:29:59.495
WHICH GROWS
IN MOST CASES

00:29:59.495 --> 00:30:03.125
IN
LARGE MONOCULTURE PLANTATIONS.

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:30.065
BANANA IS A BASIC FOOD
PRODUCT THAT IS HIGHLY

00:30:30.065 --> 00:30:32.325
DEMANDED IN THE
NORTHERN HEMISPHERE,

00:30:32.325 --> 00:30:35.295
ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE
AND THE UNITED STATES.

00:30:35.295 --> 00:30:37.825
THE WORLD BANANA TRADE
IS PRACTICALLY DOMINATED

00:30:37.825 --> 00:30:40.125
BY THREE MULTINATIONAL
COMPANIES.

00:30:40.125 --> 00:30:43.225
90% OF WHAT THE CONSUMER
PAYS STAYS IN THE NORTH,

00:30:43.225 --> 00:30:45.225
NEVER REACHING
THE PRODUCER,

00:30:45.225 --> 00:30:48.395
MUCH LESS THE FARMER.

00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:03.795
IF LATIN AMERICAN
BANANAS ARE THE CHEAPEST

00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:06.825
IT IS BECAUSE IN THOSE
PLANTATIONS BASIC WORKERS'

00:31:06.825 --> 00:31:10.665
RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL
PROBLEMS ARE IGNORED.

00:31:10.665 --> 00:31:14.925
IF THESE COSTS WERE ADDED,
IF DIGNIFIED SALARIES

00:31:14.925 --> 00:31:18.165
WERE PAID AND ENVIRONMENTAL
CONCERNS WERE ADDRESSED,

00:31:18.165 --> 00:31:23.065
THIS DIFFERENCE
WOULD DISAPPEAR.

00:31:32.965 --> 00:31:35.895
BANANA PLANTATIONS IN
LATIN AMERICA DEPEND ON

00:31:35.895 --> 00:31:38.765
LARGE AMOUNTS OF PESTICIDES
FOR THEIR PRODUCTION.

00:31:38.765 --> 00:31:41.365
IN MANY CASES THESE
PESTICIDES WERE

00:31:41.365 --> 00:31:44.725
FORBIDDEN IN OTHER
PLACES; HOWEVER,

00:31:44.725 --> 00:31:48.495
WORKERS HERE USE THEM
WITHOUT ANY PROTECTION.

00:31:48.495 --> 00:31:52.265
ACCORDING TO STUDIES
CONDUCTED AT HEREDIA

00:31:52.265 --> 00:31:54.925
NATIONAL UNIVERSITY
IN COSTA RICA,

00:31:54.925 --> 00:31:57.895
AN INCREASE IN CASES
OF STERILITY AND CANCER

00:31:57.895 --> 00:32:01.195
WAS FOUND AMONG
BANANA FARMERS.

00:32:01.195 --> 00:32:04.065
SPRAYING AND RAIN-INDUCED
SPREADING OF PESTICIDES

00:32:04.065 --> 00:32:06.625
CONTAMINATE THE WATER
THESE WORKERS, THEIR

00:32:06.625 --> 00:32:10.195
FAMILIES, AND NEIGHBORING
COMMUNITIES USE.

00:32:10.195 --> 00:32:14.325
BANANA COMPANIES AND
EXPANSION PRESSURE FARMERS

00:32:14.325 --> 00:32:17.725
WHO LIVE ON THE PERIPHERY
OF THEIR PLANTATIONS

00:32:17.725 --> 00:32:20.265
TO SELL THEIR LANDS.

00:32:20.265 --> 00:32:22.795
FARMERS WHO RESIST
ARE DENIED CREDIT

00:32:22.795 --> 00:32:25.595
UNTIL THEY GIVE IN AND
BECOME SALARIED WORKERS

00:32:25.595 --> 00:32:28.695
ON THE PLANTATION.

00:32:28.695 --> 00:32:31.595
ON THESE PLANTATIONS NOW
IN THE 21ST CENTURY

00:32:31.595 --> 00:32:33.795
EITHER THERE
ARE NO UNIONS

00:32:33.795 --> 00:32:36.095
OR THEY ARE ON THE
COMPANY'S PAYROLL.

00:32:36.095 --> 00:32:38.325
WORKERS BARELY
SUBSIST AND GENERALLY

00:32:38.325 --> 00:32:40.295
THEY'RE FIRED
BEFORE THEY MUST BE

00:32:40.295 --> 00:32:43.695
GRANTED SOME FORM
OF SOCIAL BENEFIT.

00:32:53.425 --> 00:32:57.225
THESE ARE THE PRECARIOUS
AND INSECURE CONDITIONS

00:32:57.225 --> 00:32:59.865
THAT MAKE WORKERS
AND THEIR FAMILIES

00:32:59.865 --> 00:33:03.695
FODDER FOR
ENDEMIC POVERTY.

00:33:03.695 --> 00:33:07.125
THIS IS HOW LOW BANANA
PRICES CAN BE MAINTAINED.

00:33:07.125 --> 00:33:10.125
AND THE SAME APPLIES TO
SOYBEAN AND OIL PALM.

00:33:10.125 --> 00:33:12.995
THIS IS YET ANOTHER
VICIOUS CIRCLE OF

00:33:12.995 --> 00:33:17.065
UNSUSTAINED DEVELOPMENT
AND DEFORESTATION.

00:34:02.995 --> 00:34:06.825
ASIA IS EXPERIENCING RAPID
DEFORESTATION AS WELL.

00:34:06.825 --> 00:34:09.625
THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
IN GREAT BRITAIN REQUIRED

00:34:09.625 --> 00:34:12.165
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A
RAILWAY NETWORK IN THE

00:34:12.165 --> 00:34:14.825
FAR EAST TO TRANSPORT
RAW MATERIALS TO PORTS

00:34:14.825 --> 00:34:17.025
FROM WHICH THEY
WERE SENT TO EUROPE.

00:34:17.025 --> 00:34:20.295
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS
VAST NETWORK ENTAILED THE

00:34:20.295 --> 00:34:24.665
DESTRUCTION OF MILLIONS
OF HECTARES OF FOREST.

00:34:24.665 --> 00:34:28.065
AFTER THE INDEPENDENCE
OF ASIAN COUNTRIES,

00:34:28.065 --> 00:34:30.625
THINGS DID NOT
CHANGE MUCH.

00:34:30.625 --> 00:34:33.125
LAWS PROTECTING FORESTS
IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS

00:34:33.125 --> 00:34:36.525
INDIA OR INDONESIA FORBID
WOMEN IN RURAL AREAS

00:34:36.525 --> 00:34:38.695
TO PICK BRANCHES
AND FODDER

00:34:38.695 --> 00:34:41.595
BUT THEY DON'T LIMIT
ACCESS TO LUMBER COMPANIES

00:34:41.595 --> 00:34:45.825
THAT HAVE CONTINUED
THE DEVASTATION.

00:34:45.825 --> 00:34:49.825
IN RECENT YEARS,
GOVERNMENTS OF ASIAN

00:34:49.825 --> 00:34:52.525
NATIONS HAVE PROMOTED
THE IDEA THAT THEY ARE

00:34:52.525 --> 00:34:57.025
REGENERATING
THEIR FORESTS.

00:34:57.025 --> 00:35:00.265
IN FACT, WHAT THEY HAVE
DONE IS SUBSTITUTE

00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:02.625
LOCAL SPECIES FOR
EUCALYPTUS AND PINE

00:35:02.625 --> 00:35:05.025
WITH AN EYE ON
INDUSTRIAL DEMAND

00:35:05.025 --> 00:35:08.825
AND NOT ON THE NEED OF
THE LOCAL POPULATION.

00:35:08.825 --> 00:35:12.125
EUCALYPTUS AND PINE ARE
SPECIES THAT RETAIN WATER

00:35:12.125 --> 00:35:14.495
AND THUS KILL OFF
SURROUNDING BUSHES

00:35:14.495 --> 00:35:17.395
WHICH LOCAL WOMEN DEPEND
ON TO GET BRANCHES.

00:35:17.395 --> 00:35:20.665
THIS TASK, WHICH ONCE
TOOK ONLY HALF AN HOUR,

00:35:20.665 --> 00:35:23.095
NOW TAKES BETWEEN
THREE TO SIX HOURS AND

00:35:23.095 --> 00:35:25.425
REQUIRES THE ASSISTANCE
OF THEIR DAUGHTERS,

00:35:25.425 --> 00:35:31.595
FORCING THEM
TO MISS SCHOOL.

00:35:31.595 --> 00:35:35.325
BUT THE CASE IN ASIA
IS NO EXCEPTION.

00:35:35.325 --> 00:35:39.065
BEING ECOLOGICAL IS
FASHIONABLE, THOUGH THIS

00:35:39.065 --> 00:35:42.395
FASHION IS IN PART A COVER
FOR BOGUS REHABILITATION

00:35:42.395 --> 00:35:46.725
PROJECTS THAT ARE REALLY
NEW FORMS OF EXPLOITATION.

00:35:46.725 --> 00:35:48.725
SOME COUNTRIES,
ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE,

00:35:48.725 --> 00:35:50.895
BOAST AN INCREASE
IN FOREST AREA.

00:35:50.895 --> 00:35:53.025
THAT IS A TRICKY
ASSERTION.

00:35:53.025 --> 00:35:55.195
FIRST OF ALL, MUCH
OF THIS RECOVERED AREA

00:35:55.195 --> 00:35:57.625
IS USED FOR MONOCULTURE
AND IS QUITE

00:35:57.625 --> 00:35:59.825
LESS DIVERSE THAN
IT USED TO BE.

00:35:59.825 --> 00:36:01.525
ON THE OTHER HAND,
THE CONSERVATION

00:36:01.525 --> 00:36:03.765
OF THESE FORESTS
HAS BEEN ACHIEVED

00:36:03.765 --> 00:36:06.165
AT THE EXPENSE
OF OTHER COUNTRIES' FORESTS.

00:36:06.165 --> 00:36:08.225
CHINA AND THAILAND,
FOR EXAMPLE,

00:36:08.225 --> 00:36:10.225
HAVE FORBIDDEN THEIR
TREES TO BE CUT

00:36:10.225 --> 00:36:12.525
BUT THEY ARE
THEMSELVES RESPONSIBLE

00:36:12.525 --> 00:36:16.195
FOR SLASHING FORESTS
IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.

00:37:48.665 --> 00:37:50.865
BUT LET'S GO BACK
TO LATIN AMERICA.

00:37:50.865 --> 00:37:53.725
AFTER WORLD WAR II THE
TOTAL AREA OF PASTURES

00:37:53.725 --> 00:37:55.625
IN CENTRAL
AMERICA DOUBLED

00:37:55.625 --> 00:38:00.795
AT THE EXPENSE OF
TROPICAL RAINFORESTS.

00:38:00.795 --> 00:38:04.795
THE NUMBER OF HEADS
OF CATTLE ALSO DOUBLED

00:38:04.795 --> 00:38:07.295
WHILE THE
CONSUMPTION OF BEEF

00:38:07.295 --> 00:38:09.625
BY CITIZENS OF CENTRAL
AMERICAN NATIONS

00:38:09.625 --> 00:38:13.195
DIMINISHED YEAR
AFTER YEAR.

00:38:13.195 --> 00:38:15.725
THE PRODUCTION OF BEEF
WAS EXPORTED TO MARKETS

00:38:15.725 --> 00:38:20.765
IN THE UNITED
STATES AND EUROPE.

00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:23.425
IN THE SIXTIES AND
SEVENTIES ENORMOUS

00:38:23.425 --> 00:38:26.065
EXTENSIONS OF AMAZON
RAINFOREST IN BRAZIL

00:38:26.065 --> 00:38:28.825
WERE DESTROYED TO MAKE
WAY FOR CATTLE FARMS

00:38:28.825 --> 00:38:33.325
WITH MILLIONS OF
HEADS OF CATTLE.

00:38:33.325 --> 00:38:37.795
THESE HACIENDAS WERE
DESIGNED TO COVER THE

00:38:37.795 --> 00:38:40.595
DEMAND OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BEEF MARKET

00:38:40.595 --> 00:38:43.195
AND WERE FINANCED AND
BUILT WITH FUNDS FROM

00:38:43.195 --> 00:38:48.065
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
ORGANIZATIONS.

00:38:48.065 --> 00:38:51.495
SOMETHING SIMILAR OCCURRED
IN COLUMBIA AND PERU.

00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:55.425
DEVELOPMENT MEANT
AND STILL MEANS THE

00:38:55.425 --> 00:38:59.295
DESTRUCTION OF FORESTS TO
MAKE WAY FOR BUSINESSES

00:38:59.295 --> 00:39:01.595
THAT CLASH WITH THE
INTERESTS OF THE FORESTS

00:39:01.595 --> 00:39:06.195
AND WITH THOSE OF THE
LOCAL POPULATION.

00:39:48.665 --> 00:39:51.565
IN ALL THESE CASES,
HACIENDAS PROVED TO BE

00:39:51.565 --> 00:39:54.365
UNPRODUCTIVE IN
LESS THAN TEN YEARS.

00:39:54.365 --> 00:39:56.395
BUT WAS THAT THE
END OF THE BUSINESS?

00:39:56.395 --> 00:39:59.325
NO. ONCE THE FOREST WAS
EXTERMINATED AND RENDERED

00:39:59.325 --> 00:40:02.195
LIFELESS, CATTLE RANCHERS
OBTAINED NEW CONCESSIONS

00:40:02.195 --> 00:40:04.195
TO SLASH NEW FORESTS.

00:40:04.195 --> 00:40:06.325
AND SO THE VICIOUS
CIRCLE OF DESTRUCTION

00:40:06.325 --> 00:40:08.895
GOES ROUND AND ROUND
LIKE AN ENDLESS CARROUSEL

00:40:08.895 --> 00:40:11.825
WITH NO END IN SIGHT.

00:40:11.825 --> 00:40:14.825
THE PRINCIPLE CAUSE OF
SUCH GROWTH IS THE DEMAND

00:40:14.825 --> 00:40:17.695
FOR HAMBURGER MEAT BY
FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS.

00:40:17.695 --> 00:40:20.325
THREE DECADES AGO
WHEN THE PROCESS BEGAN

00:40:20.325 --> 00:40:24.195
A KILOGRAM OF BEEF IN LATIN
AMERICA COST AROUND $1.50

00:40:24.195 --> 00:40:27.525
AND MORE THAN $3.00
IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:31.065
BUT THERE WAS A COST THAT
WAS NEVER FACTORED IN:

00:40:31.065 --> 00:40:33.525
THE COST OF THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF

00:40:33.525 --> 00:40:36.165
THOUSANDS OF HECTARES
OF VIRGIN RAINFOREST

00:40:36.165 --> 00:40:41.395
IN THE WHOLE CONTINENT.

00:40:41.395 --> 00:40:44.625
AND ALL FOR WHAT?

00:40:44.625 --> 00:40:47.025
LET US GO BACK TO OUR
EARLIER QUESTION:

00:40:47.025 --> 00:40:48.865
DID LATIN
AMERICANS ACHIEVE

00:40:48.865 --> 00:40:50.825
HIGHER DEGREES
OF DEVELOPMENT?

00:40:50.825 --> 00:40:55.195
DID THEY ERADICATE POVERTY,
MALNUTRITION, ILLITERACY?

00:40:55.195 --> 00:40:57.495
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

00:40:57.495 --> 00:41:00.625
THE LEVELS OF HUMAN
DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATED BY

00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:04.065
THE UNITED NATIONS SHOW
THAT IN ALL QUANTIFIABLE

00:41:04.065 --> 00:41:07.395
ASPECTS OF LIFE COUNTRIES
SUCH AS BRAZIL, BOLIVIA,

00:41:07.395 --> 00:41:10.665
PERU, AND VENEZUELA
ARE WORSE OFF NOW

00:41:10.665 --> 00:41:13.865
THAN THEY WERE
BEFORE THE PILLAGING.

00:41:13.865 --> 00:41:16.125
IT IS THE SO-CALLED
"HAMBURGER EFFECT",

00:41:16.125 --> 00:41:18.765
THE DIRECT CORRELATION
BETWEEN AN INCREASE IN

00:41:18.765 --> 00:41:20.965
BEEF CONSUMPTION IN
NORTHERN COUNTRIES AND

00:41:20.965 --> 00:41:24.095
DEFORESTATION AND THE LOSS
OF WEALTH AND BIODIVERSITY

00:41:24.095 --> 00:41:26.795
IN LATIN AMERICA AND
THE REST OF THE WORLD.

00:41:26.795 --> 00:41:28.925
AS THERE'S A HAMBURGER
EFFECT THERE IS ALSO

00:41:28.925 --> 00:41:31.225
A SOYBEAN EFFECT,
AN OIL PALM EFFECT,

00:41:31.225 --> 00:41:33.365
AND A PRECIOUS
WOOD EFFECT.

00:41:33.365 --> 00:41:36.365
WE BUY CHEAP - VERY CHEAP
- BUT IT IS THE FORESTS

00:41:36.365 --> 00:41:41.225
AND LOCAL POPULATIONS
THAT PAY THE DIFFERENCE.

00:41:54.425 --> 00:41:57.025
ARE WE IN TIME TO
AVERT DISASTER?

00:41:57.025 --> 00:41:59.965
IS IT POSSIBLE TO
HALT DEFORESTATION?

00:41:59.965 --> 00:42:02.395
IN THE SHORT TERM
IT SEEMS IMPROBABLE.

00:42:02.395 --> 00:42:04.495
THE INERTIA OF
THE CURRENT SYSTEM

00:42:04.495 --> 00:42:06.665
OF PRODUCTION AND
CONSUMPTION MAKE IT A

00:42:06.665 --> 00:42:09.325
VERY DIFFICULT SHORT
TERM TASK INDEED.

00:42:09.325 --> 00:42:11.765
HOWEVER, IF
THERE'S A MIRACLE,

00:42:11.765 --> 00:42:14.125
IF AT SOME POINT IN
TIME WE ARE ABLE TO

00:42:14.125 --> 00:42:16.595
UNDERSTAND THE TRUE
VALUE OF FORESTS,

00:42:16.595 --> 00:42:19.765
IT COULD BE POSSIBLE
TO REVERSE THIS TREND.

00:42:19.765 --> 00:42:22.325
ONE OF THE MOST
IMMEDIATE POSSIBILITIES

00:42:22.325 --> 00:42:25.225
FOR STOPPING DEFORESTATION
IS THE CREATION

00:42:25.225 --> 00:42:27.395
OF A NETWORK OF
PROTECTED AREAS

00:42:27.395 --> 00:42:30.395
AGAINST
OUT-OF-CONTROL EXPLOITATION.

00:42:30.395 --> 00:42:32.495
THE GOAL IS FOR ALL
COUNTRIES TO PROTECT

00:42:32.495 --> 00:42:35.395
AT LEAST 12% OF THEIR
TERRITORY IN ORDER TO

00:42:35.395 --> 00:42:37.895
CONSERVE ITS NATURAL
FLORAL AND FAUNA.

00:42:37.895 --> 00:42:39.725
BUT THIS IS
A PROPOSITION

00:42:39.725 --> 00:42:43.025
THAT IS FAR FROM
BECOMING REALITY.

00:42:57.895 --> 00:43:00.425
THE ALTERNATIVE
TO DEFORESTATION

00:43:00.425 --> 00:43:02.425
IS NOT TO
HALT DEVELOPMENT

00:43:02.425 --> 00:43:05.025
BUT TO PROMOTE
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.

00:43:05.025 --> 00:43:07.425
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
POSITIVE AND PRACTICAL

00:43:07.425 --> 00:43:10.595
PROPOSALS THAT CAN BE
WIDELY IMPLEMENTED.

00:43:10.595 --> 00:43:13.995
ONE OF THEM IS
AGRO FORESTRY,

00:43:13.995 --> 00:43:16.725
THE PRACTICE OF
ESTABLISHING ANIMAL

00:43:16.725 --> 00:43:20.025
OR CROP FARMS WITHIN
THE PRESENCE OF FORESTS.

00:43:20.025 --> 00:43:23.295
THESE ARE MIXED
PLANTATIONS IN WHICH

00:43:23.295 --> 00:43:26.725
TREES ARE AN INTEGRAL
PART OF THE PROPERTY.

00:43:26.725 --> 00:43:29.495
IT IS A PROVEN TOOL FOR THE
IMPROVEMENT OF LAND USE

00:43:29.495 --> 00:43:33.125
AND FOR THE INCREASE OF
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY.

00:43:33.125 --> 00:43:36.125
ECO-TOURISM IS
ANOTHER SUSTAINABLE

00:43:36.125 --> 00:43:38.495
DEVELOPMENT POSSIBILITY.

00:43:38.495 --> 00:43:41.425
MANY TERRITORIES THAT
MAINTAINED THEIR NATURAL

00:43:41.425 --> 00:43:43.765
HERITAGE RECEIVED
NEW INCOME -

00:43:43.765 --> 00:43:46.225
INCOME FROM TOURISM.

00:43:46.225 --> 00:43:49.265
A NATURE PARK AND ALL
THE SERVICES IT ENTAILS

00:43:49.265 --> 00:43:51.695
CREATES MORE
HIGH QUALITY JOBS

00:43:51.695 --> 00:43:59.065
THAN A SOYBEAN OR
BANANA PLANTATION.

00:43:59.065 --> 00:44:01.995
THE VERY EXPLOITATION
OF WOOD IS POSSIBLE

00:44:01.995 --> 00:44:04.295
IF IT IS DONE
RATIONALLY.

00:44:04.295 --> 00:44:07.395
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT
WORLD DEMAND FOR WOOD PULP

00:44:07.395 --> 00:44:10.125
COULD BE SATISFIED WITH
PLANTATIONS THAT TAKE UP

00:44:10.125 --> 00:44:14.065
ONLY 3% OF THE WORLD'S
FOREST RESERVE.

00:44:14.065 --> 00:44:17.225
IF THIS WERE WELL
REGULATED AND ORGANIZED,

00:44:17.225 --> 00:44:19.925
ALL OTHER FORESTS COULD
BE USED TOWARDS THE

00:44:19.925 --> 00:44:24.995
ACHIEVEMENT OF PURELY
ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES.

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:27.995
FORESTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY
BEEN UNDERRATED.

00:44:27.995 --> 00:44:30.895
ON THE OTHER HAND,
THEY OFFER A PLETHORA

00:44:30.895 --> 00:44:34.195
OF RESOURCES IF
THEY'RE TAKEN CARE OF.

00:44:34.195 --> 00:44:37.725
ANY EFFORT UNDERTAKEN TO
HALT DEFORESTATION MUST BE

00:44:37.725 --> 00:44:40.895
BASED ON THE UNDERSTANDING
OF THOSE WHO ARE ITS VERY

00:44:40.895 --> 00:44:44.665
CAUSANTS, OF ITS CAUSES,
AND OF ITS ALTERNATIVES.

00:44:44.665 --> 00:44:47.795
CIRCUMSTANCES VARY FROM
COUNTRY TO COUNTRY,

00:44:47.795 --> 00:44:50.025
BUT THERE
IS STILL TIME.

00:44:50.025 --> 00:44:53.195
WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO
PRODUCE A CHANGE IN THIS

00:44:53.195 --> 00:44:56.165
PROCESS AS WELL AS THE
NECESSARY STRATEGIES

00:44:56.165 --> 00:44:57.995
TO IMPLEMENT THEM.

00:44:57.995 --> 00:45:02.195
ALL THAT IS NEEDED IS THE
POLITICAL WILL TO DO SO.

00:45:02.195 --> 00:45:05.425
IT IS TIME FOR ALL NATIONS
TO RENEW THEIR PROMISE

00:45:05.425 --> 00:45:08.895
TO LIVE IN HARMONY WITH
TROPICAL RAINFORESTS

00:45:08.895 --> 00:45:12.595
BEFORE WE LOSE
THEM FOREVER.
