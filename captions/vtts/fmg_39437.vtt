00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.560
ON THE PLANET WERE AT
THE SAME LEVEL AS IT IS

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.100
IN THE FIRST

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.360
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERY
PERSON IN AFRICA AND INDIA

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.530
HAD ONE CAR AND
TWO TV SETS?

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.300
IF EVERY PERSON

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.560
EVERY SIX MONTHS?

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.300
IF EVERY PERSON

ON A DAILY BASIS?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.000
AND EVERY PERSON
HAD A PET

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.800
THAT WENT TO THE
PSYCHIATRIST?

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.230
NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN
BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.760
FOR SUCH THINGS
TO EVER HAPPEN.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.900
THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF
PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.800
IS UNSUSTAINABLE.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.830
IT'S BASED ON TWO
PRINCIPLES THAT ARE

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.160
IMPOSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN
IN THE LONG TERM:

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.360
THE INDISCRIMINATE
USE OF RAW MATERIALS

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.160
AND THE DIFFICULTY THAT
TWO-THIRDS OF ALL MANKIND

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.130
ENCOUNTER WHEN
TRYING TO GAIN ACCESS

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.160
TO THE BENEFITS
OF PROGRESS.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.100
THE CURRENT SYSTEM
OF PRODUCTION AND

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.960
CONSUMPTION, FAR FROM
LEADING THE WAY TO GLOBAL

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.600
DEVELOPMENT, CAUSES MAJOR
ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.460
AND INCREASES INEQUALITY
BETWEEN RICH AND POOR.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.330
AT LEAST ONE BILLION
PEOPLE ON THIS PLANET

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.330
LIVE IN A WORLD APART
WHICH GETS WORSE EVERY DAY.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.530
ONE OF THE GREATEST
FALLACIES WE ENCOUNTER

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.130
WHEN TRYING TO EXPLAIN
THE CAUSES OF POVERTY

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.200
AND ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.760
IS PUTTING THE BLAME
ON OVERPOPULATION.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.930
THIS IS
SIMPLY NOT TRUE.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.900
JAPAN, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS
MANY MORE INHABITANTS

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.360
PER SQUARE KILOMETER THAN
BRAZIL, INDIA OR MEXICO

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.200
AND YET ITS OVERPOPULATION
DOESN'T CAUSE MISERY,

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.330
MALNUTRITION OR
ECOLOGICAL PROBLEMS.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.500
THE TRUE CAUSES OF
POVERTY AND ENVIRONMENTAL

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.960
DETERIORATION ARE
INEQUALITY AND INJUSTICE.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.860
OVER THE LAST FOUR
DECADES AS THE EARTH'S

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.100
POPULATION DOUBLED,
FOOD PRODUCTION

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.700
HAS INCREASED BY
A FACTOR OF THREE.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.500
THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH
FOOD FOR EVERYONE.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.200
EVEN SO, AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE 21ST CENTURY

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.500
IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED
THAT ONE BILLION PEOPLE

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.560
ARE UNDERNOURISHED
- A MUCH LARGER NUMBER

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.430
THAN JUST FOUR
DECADES AGO.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.400
INEQUALITY AND INJUSTICE
IS EVEN MORE EVIDENT

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.260
IN THE USE OF ENERGY SOURCES
AND NATURAL RESOURCES.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.800
DURING THE SECOND HALF
OF THE 20TH CENTURY

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.100
THE CONSUMPTION OF
WATER HAS QUADRUPLED

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.760
IN FIRST
WORLD COUNTRIES.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.660
EVERY TIME SOMEONE IN
EUROPE OR THE UNITED STATES

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.600
FLUSHES THE TOILET
HE'S USING THE SAME

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.660
AMOUNT OF WATER THAT
MILLIONS OF FAMILIES

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.330
HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL
IN THE THIRD WORLD.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.300
OUT-OF-CONTROL
INDUSTRIALIZATION,

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.100
WASTE ON IRRIGATION SYSTEMS,
AND THE GENERALIZED

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.130
BUT FALSE IDEA THAT WATER
IS AN UNLIMITED RESOURCE

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.060
HAVE PAVED THE ROAD FROM
WASTEFULNESS TO SCARCITY.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.400
MEANWHILE 1.1 BILLION
PEOPLE HAVE NO ACCESS

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.760
TO RUNNING WATER
AND 2.6 BILLION

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.930
LACK ANY KIND OF
SANITATION FACILITIES.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.700
THE USE OF ENERGY IS
ANOTHER CRUCIAL POINT.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.700
INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES
WHICH HAVE ONLY

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.830
20% OF THE
GLOBAL POPULATION

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.960
USE UP TO 80% OF
THE WORLD'S ENERGY.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.560
IF WE WANT THE WHOLE
OF HUMANITY SHARING OUR

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.730
HIGH STANDARDS OF LIFE,
ENERGY CONSUMPTION

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.060
WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE
BY A FACTOR OF FIVE.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.700
DO WE HAVE THAT AMOUNT OF
ENERGY AT OUR DISPOSAL

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.660
THAT IS CLEAN, SAFE
AND RENEWABLE?

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.700
OR TO PUT IT SIMPLY,
DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.360
THAT AMOUNT OF ENERGY?

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.200
THE ANSWER IS
DEFINITELY NOT.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.960
AFRICA IS THE TRAGIC
CONSEQUENCE OF A SYSTEM

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.300
THAT ISN'T ABLE TO OFFER
SOLUTIONS FOR EVERYONE

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.260
- A CONTINENT THAT
IS MARGINALIZED BY

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.730
INTERNATIONAL
ECONOMIC NETWORKS.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.800
THE UNITED NATIONS
PUBLISHES A YEARLY

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.200
DOCUMENT THAT LISTS THE
35 COUNTRIES WITH THE

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.400
LOWEST INDEX OF
HUMAN DEVELOPMENT.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.160
27 OF THOSE
ARE IN AFRICA.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.230
THIS INDEX DISPLAYS DATA
ON ALPHABETIZATION,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:15.500
ACCESS TO WATER, HEALTH CARE,
FOOD AND COMMUNICATION.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.900
IN AFRICA THERE IS
ONLY ONE DOCTOR

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.630
FOR EVERY 18,000
INHABITANTS

THERE'S ONE
FOR EVERY 300.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.930
THERE ARE 30 MILLION
PEOPLE INFECTED WITH HIV

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.930

DON'T HAVE ACCESS

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.530

CHILDREN WHO ARE

NOT IN SCHOOL.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.130
23 MILLION WHO
ARE MALNOURISHED.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.400
IN THE VAST MAJORITY
OF AFRICAN COUNTRIES

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.730
MILITARY EXPENDITURES
ARE TWICE AND THREE TIMES

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.700
AS MUCH AS EDUCATION AND
HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.030
THEIR ECONOMIES
RELY ON SUBSIDIES

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.860
BECAUSE THE DEVELOPED
COUNTRIES WOULD RATHER

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.760
CLEAR THEIR CONSCIENCES BY
MEANS OF INTERNATIONAL AID

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.100
THAN BY OPENING THE
BORDERS TO A JUST

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.560
AND BALANCED
COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.100
THE PLUNDERING OF
RAW MATERIALS THAT

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.360
CHARACTERIZED THE
COLONIAL RELATIONSHIP

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.560
BETWEEN EUROPE AND
AFRICA DURING THE 19TH

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.700
AND 20TH CENTURIES
STILL CONTINUES.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.060
THE ACTORS AND SOME OF
THE METHODS HAVE CHANGED

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.430
BUT THE ESSENCE OF THE
SYSTEM REMAINS THE SAME.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.430
FIRST WORLD COMPANIES,
AIDED BY UNFAIR

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.660
INTERNATIONAL LAWS
AND LOCAL ELITES,

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.960
EXTRACT RAW MATERIALS
WITHOUT ANY KIND OF CONTROL

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.530
AND WITH MINIMUM BENEFITS
TO THE NATIVE POPULATIONS.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.130
AS TIME GOES BY,
AFRICAN LANDS

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.530
SUFFER MORE AND
MORE DEFORESTATION.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.000
AFFECTED IN THE SAME
MANNER AS THE AMAZON

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.260
OR THE INDONESIAN JUNGLES
OR AS MOST JUNGLES

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.000
ON THE PLANET, AFRICA
CURRENTLY LOSES THE SAME

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.300
AMOUNT OF FOREST THAT IT
LOST DURING THE FIRST HALF

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.800
OF THE 20TH CENTURY
EVERY FIVE YEARS

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.760
AND RECEIVES
NOTHING IN RETURN.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.100
THE NEW ERA OF
GLOBALIZATION HASN'T

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.630
BROUGHT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST
SHIMMER OF HOPE EITHER.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.930
WITH A HUGE GEOGRAPHICAL
EXPANSE AND A POPULATION

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.500
THAT CORRESPONDS TO ABOUT
10% OF THE POPULATION

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.660
OF THE PLANET,
AFRICA ONLY RECEIVES

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.930
ONE PERCENT OF ALL
GLOBAL INVESTMENT.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.960
ONLY THREE COUNTRIES IN
AFRICA - SENEGAL, BOTSWANA

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.060
AND SOUTH AFRICA - HAVE
ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.500
THE REMAINING ONES
MUST FINANCE THEMSELVES

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.060
BY MEANS OF SO-CALLED
DEVELOPMENT AIDS,

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.260
WHICH ARE LOANS IN
DISGUISE THAT MUST BE

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.460
REINVESTED IN
THEIR FULL AMOUNT

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.000
TO BUY GOODS AND SERVICES
FROM LEADING COUNTRIES

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.160
OR IN PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT
COMPANIES OF THESE COUNTRIES

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.860
RATHER THAN THE
AFRICAN PEOPLE.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.600
THIS SYSTEM OF AID
SERVES MAINLY TO

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.330
ENRICH LOCAL LEADERS
SUPPORTED BY DONORS

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.860
WHO USE THEM TO
CLEAR THEIR CONSCIENCES

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:08.200
BUT NOT TO PROMOTE
TRUE DEVELOPMENT.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.330
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT
SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.500
IS AT THE TOP OF ALL
UNDERDEVELOPMENT

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.900
STATISTICS LISTS IS
BECAUSE OF ITS POOR

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.830
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.760
PRODUCTS ARE NOT
MANUFACTURED IN AFRICA.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.730
RAW MATERIALS ARE NOT
MODIFIED THERE EITHER.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.600
RAW MATERIALS ARE JUST
EXTRACTED AND TAKEN FROM

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.730
THE CONTINENT THROUGH
AGREEMENTS THAT BENEFIT

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.330
THE LOCAL ELITES AND
INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.300
THE BENEFITS ARE
NOT REINTRODUCED

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.260
INTO THE STATE
OR ITS POPULATION.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.700
NATURE IS DESTROYED AND
RESOURCES ARE DIMINISHED

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:28.460
BUT NO NEW JOBS
ARE CREATED.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.930
IN THE IVORY COAST,
COMPANIES FROM ENGLAND,

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.860
FRANCE, HOLLAND AND JAPAN
EXPLOIT WOOD RESOURCES

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.000
WITHOUT ANY KIND OF
CONTROL AND WITHOUT

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.160
DATA BEING GATHERED
ON THE PERCENTAGES

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
OF PARTICIPATION IN
SUCH EXPLOITATION.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.730
OF COURSE NO ONE EVEN
DISCUSSES THE POSSIBILITY

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.460
OF CREATING INDUSTRIES THAT
MANUFACTURE WOOD PRODUCTS

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:52.400
AND GENERATE
EMPLOYMENT LOCALLY.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.060
IN UGANDA THE MONOCULTURE
OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.700
DESTINED FOR EXPORTATION
HAS SPREAD ON THE MOST

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.430
FERTILE GROUNDS TO THE
EXTENT THAT LOCAL FARMERS

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.960
CANNOT EVEN PARTICIPATE
IN THE BUSINESS.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.430
ANGOLA, A WAR TORN COUNTRY
THAT HAS MORE BURIED

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.630
ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES
THAN INHABITANTS,

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.630
RELIES ON
PETROLEUM FOR

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:30.730
50% OF ITS GROSS
INTERNAL PRODUCT.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.060
THERE ARE ALSO GOLD
AND DIAMOND MINES.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.360
THE EXTRACTION OF
THESE RAW MATERIALS

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.800
YIELDS MULTI-MILLION
DOLLAR BENEFITS

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.730
THAT DON'T STAY
ON THE CONTINENT,

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:43.230
BUT INSTEAD END UP IN
SECRET BANK ACCOUNTS

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:49.100
OR IN THE POCKETS OF LOCAL
AND FOREIGN MIDDLEMEN.

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:25.000
THE WODABE
NOMADS OF NIGER,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.160
LIKE MANY OTHERS
THROUGHOUT THE CONTINENT,

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.700
ARE ABANDONING THEIR
TRADITIONAL WAYS OF LIFE

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.900
TO MIGRATE TO THE
CAPITAL, NIAMEY.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.260
THEY'RE SEARCHING FOR
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS THE

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.430
DREAM OF PROGRESS AND
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.330
PROGRESS MEANS HAVING A
HEALTH CARE CENTER NEARBY,

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.600
A SCHOOL FOR THEIR CHILDREN,
OR A CAR TO COMMUTE IN.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.460
WE'RE NOT THAT
DIFFERENT AFTER ALL.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.430
TELECOMMUNICATIONS ISN'T THE
ONLY THING THAT IS GLOBAL.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.030
BASIC NECESSITIES
ARE ALSO GLOBAL.

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.730
WE'RE CREATING A NEW ERA
PLAGUED BY CHALLENGES

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:50.300
AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT
ARE NOT FOR EVERYONE.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.900
TO BUY A COMPUTER IN NIGER
OR MALI A SCHOOL TEACHER

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.930
WOULD HAVE TO PAY A FULL
FOUR YEARS' SALARY WHILE

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.430
THAT SAME TEACHER IN THE
UNITED STATES OR IN EUROPE

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.300
WOULD BUY IT WITH A
SINGLE MONTH'S SALARY.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.860
ONLY .2% OF ALL AFRICANS
HAVE INTERNET ACCESS.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:20.000
BUT IT'S NOT
NECESSARY TO FOCUS ON

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.530
THE INFORMATION
SUPER HIGHWAY.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.600
LET'S PLACE OUR
SITES ON THE HIGHWAYS

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.360
OF ASPHALT AND TAR.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.730
ALMOST NO SUB-SAHARAN
COUNTRY HAS A NETWORK

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:30.500
OF HIGHWAYS
THAT FACILITATES

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.500
THE TRANSIT OF
PEOPLE AND MERCHANDISE,

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.260
A NETWORK THAT ALLOWS
FOR COMMERCE TO OCCUR.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.060
WITHOUT COMMERCE THERE'S
NO PRESENT OR FUTURE AND

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:43.930
WITHOUT IT THE ONLY ROAD
ONE CAN TAKE IS MIGRATION.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.130
WHATEVER DATA WE MAY LOOK
AT - WHETHER IT'S ACCESS

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.900
TO EDUCATION, WATER,
HEALTH CARE OR INTERNET,

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.830
SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA REMAINS
AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL LISTS.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.300
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
AFRICA AND THE REST OF

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.800
THE WORLD HAVE
NEVER BEEN SO DIRE.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.260
ANOTHER REGION THAT HAS
A SIMILAR SITUATION

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.430
TO SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
IS LATIN AMERICA -

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.700
SPECIFICALLY MOST OF ITS
FORTY MILLION INDIGENOUS

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.160
INHABITANTS LIVING
IN AWFUL CONDITIONS.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.060
DURING THE PAST DECADES
THESE ETHNIC POPULATIONS

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.260
HAVE ACHIEVED GOALS
IN TERMS OF POLITICAL

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.400
REPRESENTATION BUT HAVE
MADE LITTLE PROGRESS

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.930
ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:10.030
THEY CONTINUE TO SUFFER
UNDER HIGH LEVELS OF

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.560
POVERTY, POOR EDUCATION,
AND A HIGHER INCIDENCE

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.400
OF ILLNESS AND
DISCRIMINATION

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.960
THAN THE REMAINING
PEOPLE OF LATIN AMERICA.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.260
THEY REPRESENT MORE
THAN 400 ETHNIC GROUPS

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.400
WITH THEIR OWN LANGUAGE,
SOCIAL ORDER,

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.230
AND UNIQUE VISION
OF THE WORLD.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.860
TRADITIONALLY THEY HAVE
ALSO BEEN THE MOST

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.330
AFFECTED POPULATION BY
ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.300
IN ALL OF
LATIN AMERICA.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.860
IN THE HIGH PLATEAUS OF
THE ANDES, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:46.300
MORE THAN HALF OF THE
TOTAL POPULATION IS POOR.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.560
BUT ALMOST THREE-FOURTHS
OF THE INDIGENOUS

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.830
POPULATION LIVES
IN POVERTY.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.530
IN ECUADOR POVERTY RATES
AMONG INDIGENOUS PEOPLE

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:58.230
ARE NEARLY 90%, REACHING
96% IN RURAL AREAS.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.630
IN MEXICO THE INCIDENCE OF
EXTREME POVERTY IN 2002

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.300
WAS FIVE TIMES HIGHER
IN MUNICIPALITIES

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.760
WITH MOSTLY INDIGENOUS
PEOPLE THAN IN OTHERS.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.730
IN THE PAST DECADES
THERE HASN'T BEEN

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.730
ANY KIND OF IMPROVEMENT
IN THE PROBLEM OF

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.400
HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
AMONG INDIGENOUS PEOPLE.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.800
TO BE INDIGENOUS IN LATIN
AMERICA IS EQUIVALENT TO

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.900
HAVING HIGH PROBABILITIES
OF BEING POOR,

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.330
HAVING VERY DIFFICULT
ACCESS TO EDUCATION,

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.500
AND EVEN WORSE
TO HEALTH CARE.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.760
IF ON TOP OF ALL THAT
YOU'RE AN INDIGENOUS WOMAN

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.960
YOU'LL HAVE THREE TIMES
MORE CHANCES TO DIE

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.960
DURING CHILDBIRTH
THAN IF YOU'RE NOT.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.900
AND YOUR CHILDREN
WILL FACE AN

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.930
INFANT MORTALITY
RATE 60% HIGHER

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.730
THAN THE REMAINING NON
INDIGENOUS POPULATION.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:58.760
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS
THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.000
BRAZIL HAVE BEEN VIOLENTLY
DISOWNED FROM THEIR LAND

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.060
BY THOSE WHO PRETEND TO
BE THE NEW LANDOWNERS.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.530
AT PRESENT THIS VIOLENCE
CONTINUES WITH THE

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:10.330
PARTICIPATION OF MANY
RIVALING INTERESTS BETWEEN

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.360
PETROLEUM PROSPECTORS,
CATTLEMEN, LANDOWNERS,

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.500
LUMBER COMPANIES
AND THE MILITARY.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.960
THESE GROUPS ARE VERY
RICH ECONOMICALLY AND

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.400
POLITICALLY AND THEY USE
THIS POWER TO DELAY ALL

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.060
RESOLUTIONS REGARDING
CONFLICTS OVER LAND.

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:37.200
FOR MANY YEARS THE
INDIGENOUS LEADERS

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.160
THAT HAVE HEADED THE
CAMPAIGNS AND ACTIVITIES

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.600
TO ACCELERATE THE
TRANSFER OF LAND OWNERSHIP

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.800
HAVE RECEIVED DEATH
THREATS AND ARE VICTIMS

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.130
OF VIOLENT ATTACKS
AND ASSASSINATIONS.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:48.060
ON TOP OF THAT THEY
BASICALLY GET

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.300
NO PROTECTION
FROM THE STATE.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.630
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE
AMAZON FOREST IS SPEEDING

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.530
UP AND ITS INHABITANTS ARE
DISOWNED AND ASSASSINATED

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.730
WITHOUT THE EXISTENCE OF ANY
POLITICAL WILL TO STOP IT

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.130
- NEITHER A GLOBAL
NOR A LOCAL WILL.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.900
IT'S NOT A SHORT TERM
PRIORITY TO PUT INTO EFFECT

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:09.730
THE RESOURCES THAT WOULD
STOP SUCH A BLOODY TRAGEDY.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.000
IS IT A COINCIDENCE
THAT POVERTY

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.960
AND UNDERDEVELOPMENT
EXIST HISTORICALLY

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.900
IN CERTAIN REGIONS
OF THE WORLD?

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.930
DOES THIS COINCIDENCE
OBEY CLIMATE

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:14.730
AND CULTURE
RELATED REASONS?

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.900
OR IS THERE
SOMETHING MORE TO IT?

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.860
OUT OF THE 170 ARMED
CONFRONTATIONS THAT HAVE

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.900
TAKEN PLACE ON EARTH
AFTER WORLD WAR II,

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.760
160 HAVE OCCURRED IN
THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.860
THESE CONFRONTATIONS
HAVE CLAIMED MORE THAN

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:32.530
30 MILLION LIVES AND THE
COUNTING HASN'T STOPPED YET.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.700
IN THE VAST MAJORITY
OF THESE BATTLES

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.430
HIDING BEHIND THE FACADE
OF AN INTER-TRIBAL

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.500
OR RELIGIOUS CONFRONTATION
WE FIND THE INTERESTS

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.600
OF WORLD POWERS AND
MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.300
THE END OF THE COLD WAR
AND VICTORY OF MARKET

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.300
ECONOMY OVER COMMUNISM
DIDN'T END THESE WARS.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.360
RATHER THE CONTRARY
HAS HAPPENED.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.460
SINCE THE FALL OF
THE BERLIN WALL

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.900
THE PRODUCTION AND
EXPORTATION OF WEAPONS

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.460
TO AFRICA, FAR MIDDLE EAST,
AND LATIN AMERICA

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.730
HAS INCREASED BY
A FACTOR OF THREE.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:16.500
THE MANUFACTURERS OF THESE
WEAPONS ARE NOT CONNIVING

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.230
MAFIOSI, BUT THE VERY
WESTERN STATES AND

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.330
COMPANIES THAT WORK
UNDER THE SUPERVISION

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.430
OF COUNTRIES LIKE
GREAT BRITAIN, FRANCE,

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:29.830
THE UNITED
STATES, OR SPAIN.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.600
A BLOODY EXAMPLE IS THE ONE
OF ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.760
THESE MINES ARE SPREAD
THROUGHOUT THE THIRD WORLD

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.700
LIKE A GRUESOME LEGACY
FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.830
IN CHAD ALONE THERE ARE
ONE MILLION BURIED MINES

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.830
THROUGHOUT MOST
OF THE TERRITORY,

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:00.130
MAINLY IN THE NORTHERN
PART OF THE COUNTRY.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.330
IN THIS CASE AS WELL AS
IN THE CASE OF ANGOLA

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.430
AND MANY
OTHER COUNTRIES,

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.630
THERE'S A SINISTER PARADOX
- THE DOUBLE BUSINESS

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:10.000
OF SELLING AND
DE-ACTIVATING MINES.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.900
THE SAME COUNTRIES
THAT SOLD THEM

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:16.060
ARE NOW IN CHARGE OF
DE-ACTIVATING THEM.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.430
AN ENTIRE COUNTRY LIKE
CHAD IS AFFECTED BY

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:20.360
UNUSED BUT
LIVE AMMUNITION.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.300
THERE ARE MISSILES,
BOMBS, AND GRENADES

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.530
THAT ARE AS DANGEROUS
AS THE MINES. IN FACT,

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:29.230
THERE'S MORE UNUSED AND
LIVE AMMUNITION THAN MINES.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:31.260
TO BUILD AND BURY
A MINE ON THE GROUND

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.030
COSTS A FEW DOLLARS.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:36.000
TO DIG IT OUT AND GET RID
OF IT COSTS MANY THOUSANDS.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.030
BUT THE INVOICES COME
FROM THE SAME ADDRESS.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:42.030
IN THE MEANTIME THE LAND
IS SOWED WITH HUNGER

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.360
AND UNDERDEVELOPMENT.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.600
ALTHOUGH IT IS A WORLDWIDE
PROBLEM, AFRICA IS THE

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.160
CONTINENT MOST AFFECTED
BY ARMS TRAFFICKING

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.500
AND THE PROLIFERATION
OF TRIBAL WAR.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.560
THERE ARE MORE THAN
100,000 CHILDREN SOLDIERS

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.530
IN THE
SUB-SAHARAN REGION.

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:32.700
OF THE 13 MILLION PEOPLE
WHO HAVE DIED IN WARS

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.330
DURING THE LAST DECADE
12 MILLION WERE AFRICAN.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.660
EVEN AFTER THE END OF
MOST OF THESE CONFLICTS

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.000
AFRICA IS STILL A
VERY DANGEROUS CONTINENT

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.460
FOR MOST OF
ITS POPULATION.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.960
I HAVE JUST SURVEYED
4,500 KILOMETERS

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.930
OF THE NORTHERN
PART OF THE COUNTRY

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:02.860
AND I'VE TAKEN
HUNDREDS OF PICTURES.

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:08.060
HERE, FOR INSTANCE, IS
A PHOTO OF A PROJECTILE

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:12.360
THAT'S NEAR A HOUSE.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.800
HERE ARE SOME PICTURES
THAT SHOW HOW BEAUTIFUL

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.900
THIS COUNTRY IS AND
ALSO WHAT CAN HAPPEN TO

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:24.000
A VEHICLE THAT VENTURES
INTO NO MAN'S LAND.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.800
HERE THERE'S A
MINEFIELD AND A VEHICLE

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:33.500
THAT WAS BLASTED BY
ONE OF THE MINES.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.330
HERE ARE SOME ARROW-SHAPED
PROJECTILES WHICH ARE

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:39.260
VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE
THEY PACK ROCKETS.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.230
ANY CHILD THAT HITS
IT WHILE PLAYING

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:48.800
WILL LOSE AN
ARM OR HIS LIFE.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.760
THIS IS THE
WADI DUM CAMP

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.460
WHICH HAS
MANY OF THEM.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.600
OUR MAIN PRIORITY IS TO
TAKE CARE OF PROJECTILES

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.330
FOUND NEAR TOWNS THAT
HAVE CAUSED ACCIDENTS,

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:06.460
MUTILATIONS, DEATHS.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:11.030
YOU CAN SEE AN EXAMPLE
OF HOW DANGEROUS THIS IS

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:12.660
FOR THE POPULATION.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.060
THIS IS A BMP
LOADED WITH MUNITIONS

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.100
AND IT'S RIGHT NEXT
TO THE HOSPITAL.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.600
AND THE BUILDING
BEHIND IS A SCHOOL.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.430
AFTER THE
WARS HAD ENDED,

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.500
TANKS ARMED WITH
MUNITIONS WERE ABANDONED.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:32.000
CHILDREN PLAY HERE AND
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.060
IN GUEREDA
A MUNITIONS DEPOT

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:39.330
BLEW UP IN THE
MIDDLE OF TOWN.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.560
THIS IS WHAT WAS
LEFT OF TWO KIDS

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.230
WHO PLAYED WITH
A PROJECTILE.

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:50.160
BOTH OF THEM DIED.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.660
THESE ARE THE TYPES OF
SITUATIONS THAT WE FACE

00:32:54.660 --> 00:33:01.630
AND THAT THE POPULATION
KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT.

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:08.560
BESIDES ITS ENORMOUS OIL
RESERVES, AFRICA HAS

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:12.830
TWO-THIRDS OF THE WORLD'S
MINERAL DEPOSITS.

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:15.860
MANY TIMES THE FIGHT IS
NOT FOR CONTROL OF THE

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.300
STATE BUT FOR THE CONTROL
OF NATURAL RESOURCES.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.830
IN THE CONGO, LIBERIA,
AND IN THE IVORY COAST

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:23.200
PRIVATE ARMIES OF
MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.600
SPONSORED BY THE AMERICAN
AND FRENCH GOVERNMENTS,

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.200
AMONG OTHERS, GREATLY
EXPAND THE CONFLICT.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.330
THEY SHOW NO SCRUPLES WHEN
APPROACHING WELL KNOWN

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:34.100
WAR CRIMINALS AND
SUPPLYING THEM WITH WEAPONS

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.900
IN ORDER TO SECURE
NATURAL RESOURCES.

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.430
WAR IS THE
PRINCIPLE REASON

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:46.160
FOR THE EXPANSION
OF POVERTY.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.500
THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE
FIRST WORLD ALLOCATE

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.730
LARGE SUMS TO WHAT THEY
CALL DEVELOPMENTAL AID.

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:53.160
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
THEY EXPAND THE WAR

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.760
AND THEREFORE IMPEDE
THAT VERY DEVELOPMENT.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.430
IS THIS A CONTRADICTION?

00:33:57.430 --> 00:34:00.700
NO, THEY ARE BOTH SIDES
OF THE SAME BUSINESS.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.730
THIRD WORLD UNDER
DEVELOPMENT AND POVERTY

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:04.760
IS NOT THE PRODUCT
OF CLIMATE OR CULTURE

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.200
BUT OF PILLAGING
AND INJUSTICE.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:34.060
AND IN THIS SYSTEM OF GLOBAL
POVERTY AND INJUSTICE

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:37.330
WOMEN AND CHILDREN
ARE THE BIG LOSERS.

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:39.800
IN RECENT YEARS THE
ENFORCEMENT OF HARSH

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.030
NEO-LIBERAL POLICIES HAVE
LED TO CUTS IN EDUCATION

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:45.630
AND HEALTH SPENDING AND
TO AN INCREASE IN THE

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:48.260
IMPUNITY OF MULTINATIONAL
COMPANIES THAT CONDUCT

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.630
THEIR BUSINESS WITHOUT
ANY CHECKS AND BALANCES

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.530
IN THE THIRD
WORLD COUNTRIES.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:55.700
THE LAST TWO DECADES
HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.400
IN THE NUMBER OF
CHILD LABORERS.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.500
ONE OUT OF EVERY
THREE AFRICAN CHILDREN

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:02.030
AND ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE
LATIN AMERICAN CHILDREN

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:03.460
IS EMPLOYED.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.800
EVEN IN BUOYANT COUNTRIES
OF THE FAR EAST

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.300
THE USE OF CHILDREN FOR
CHEAP LABOR IS CUSTOMARY.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.530
WOMEN AND CHILDREN PERFORM
FAR MORE ARDUOUS TASKS

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:15.060
AND RECEIVE FAR LESS
PAY THAN MEN DO.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.000
IT IS A VICIOUS CYCLE
WHOSE ORIGINS ARE EXTREME

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:28.400
POVERTY, A SCARCITY OF
WORK, AND UNFAIR SALARIES.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.800
A LACK OF INCOME FORCES
PARENTS TO RELY ON

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.600
THE WORK OF
THEIR CHILDREN.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.660
WITHOUT THAT INCOME
THE FAMILY INCOME

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:36.930
WOULD COLLAPSE.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.000
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
CHILDREN ARE LEFT

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.030
WITHOUT AN EDUCATION
THAT COULD OTHERWISE

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:44.330
SAVE THEM FROM THIS
CYCLE OF MISERY.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.530
ACCORDING TO UNITED
NATIONS' FIGURES

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.060
THERE ARE 1.3 BILLION
POOR PEOPLE IN THE WORLD,

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.030
70% OF WHICH
ARE WOMEN.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:14.860
HALF OF THEM ARE
ILLITERATE WHO WILL

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.860
NEVER HAVE ACCESS
TO AN EDUCATION.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.060
80 MILLION CHILDREN
LIVE IN THE STREETS

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:23.960
OF SPRAWLING
METROPOLISES.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.600
THERE ARE THOSE
WHO AFFIRM THAT

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.860
NEVER IN THE
HISTORY OF MAN

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:31.030
HAVE SO MANY HAD ACCESS TO
THE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPMENT.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.830
IN ABSOLUTE NUMBERS IT IS
AN IRREFUTABLE STATISTIC.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:36.160
BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.500
MUCH INEQUALITY BETWEEN
DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.830
FOR EXAMPLE, A CHILD BORN
IN MYANMAR IS TWENTY TIMES

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.400
AS LIKELY TO DIE
BEFORE HE TURNS FIVE

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.600
THAN A CHILD
BORN IN CALIFORNIA.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.260
AND THIS DISPARITY, LIKE
SO MANY OTHERS, FAR FROM

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:53.800
NARROWING, IS GREATER NOW
THAN IT WAS A DECADE AGO.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.900
INDIA IS A UNIQUE EXAMPLE
OF THE RELATIONSHIP

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.000
BETWEEN THE PROCESS
OF GLOBALIZATION

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.600
AND THE THIRD WORLD.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.730
ACCORDING TO
MICRO-ECONOMIC DATA

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:02.030
INDIA IS GROWING
AND ITS DEVELOPMENT

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.700
IS CREATING PROSPERITY.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.630
THAT'S WHAT
THE DATA SAYS.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.730
THE REALITY IS VERY
DIFFERENT, THOUGH,

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:09.700
ESPECIALLY FOR
WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.260
INDIA HAS ONE OF THE BEST
ARMIES IN THE WORLD

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.960
AS WELL AS THE
ATOMIC BOMB.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.900
IT BOASTS ENORMOUS
INVESTMENTS

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.260
IN COMPUTER SOFTWARE

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:21.260
AND A FILM INDUSTRY
THAT RIVALS HOLLYWOOD.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.800
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, MORE
THAN 700,000 CHILDREN

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.460
UNDER THE AGE OF
FIVE DIE EACH YEAR

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.930
FROM DIARRHEA CAUSED
BY A LACK OF HYGIENE,

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:32.560
OF ACCESS TO DRINKING
WATER, AND, IN GENERAL,

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.630
OF ACCESS TO
HEALTH CENTERS.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.600
NOTWITHSTANDING A
PROHIBITIVE LAW,

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.200
MORE THAN HALF OF ALL
INDIAN WOMEN GET MARRIED

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.730
AND HAVE THEIR FIRST CHILD
BEFORE THEY TURN FIFTEEN,

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:45.860
WHICH CAUSES HUGE
GYNECOLOGICAL PROBLEMS.

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:12.460
AS IS THE CASE IN MANY
COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD,

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:15.130
EXTREME POVERTY AND LOW
DEVELOPMENT POSSIBILITIES

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:17.100
HAVE FORCED THE
RURAL POPULATION

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.800
TO MIGRATE TO CITIES.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.330
THERE, FAMILIES GATHER IN
POOR QUARTERS OR SLUMS.

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:25.460
THESE GHETTOS WHICH ARE
ESSENTIALLY SHANTY TOWNS

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.830
GROW RAPIDLY AND
CHAOTICALLY.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:30.160
THERE IS NO DRINKING
WATER AVAILABLE

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.860
AND EXTREMELY
UNSANITARY CONDITIONS

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:38.130
HELP SPREAD THE
SCOURGE OF DISEASES.

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:43.500
POVERTY AND A SUBSISTENCE
CULTURE ARE THE REASONS

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.760
WHY MANY CHILDREN
ABANDON SCHOOL

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.960
TO CONTRIBUTE TO
THE FAMILY ECONOMY.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.630
THIS SITUATION IS EVEN
HARSHER FOR GIRLS,

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:54.960
SINCE WOMEN IN INDIA
HAVE BEEN RELEGATED

00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:00.800
TO THE LOWEST STRATA
OF SOCIAL LIFE.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:05.100
BUT WOMEN IN INDIA ARE NOT
THE ONLY VICTIMS OF POVERTY.

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.060
THE MASSIVE DISCRIMINATION
THAT TAKES PLACE IN INDIA

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.430
IS EVEN MANIFESTED IN
THE RAMPANT KILLING

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:12.500
OF UNBORN FETUSES.

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:15.160
IN 80% OF THE COUNTRY'S
DISTRICTS THE FEMALE

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:18.560
POPULATION HAS PLUMMETED
DRASTICALLY SINCE 1991.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.730
ONE OUT OF EVERY
SIX INDIAN GIRLS

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:23.260
DON'T REACH THEIR
15TH BIRTHDAY.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.600
AND OF THE 12 MILLION
GIRLS BORN EACH YEAR

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:32.260
ONE MILLION DIE BEFORE
THEY'RE TWELVE MONTHS OLD.

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.630
THERE ARE ECONOMIC
AND CULTURAL REASONS

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:37.500
TO BLAME FOR THIS.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.230
NOWADAYS COUPLES PLAN ON
HAVING JUST ONE CHILD,

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.760
PREFERABLY A BOY.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.330
PARENTS BELIEVE IT IS MORE
PROFITABLE TO INVEST IN

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.860
THE EDUCATION OF A SON
SINCE TRADITIONALLY

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.200
A GIRL WILL GO LIVE WITH
HER HUSBAND'S FAMILY

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.430
AFTER THE WEDDING.

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:52.760
THIS ECONOMIC YET
MACABRE LOGIC

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:57.000
IS THE CAUSE OF MILLIONS
OF FEMALE DEATHS.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:11.860
INDIA PRESENTS
AN EXTREME CASE,

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.860
THOUGH IT IS BY NO
MEANS EXCEPTIONAL.

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:16.460
ROUTINE KILLINGS OF WOMEN
OCCUR ACROSS THE GLOBE,

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.630
ESPECIALLY IN
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:20.960
THERE ARE MANY CAUSES BUT
THE GREAT EVIL BEHIND

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.430
THESE HORRIFIC ACTS
IS ALWAYS THE SAME -

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:27.260
MALE CHAUVINISM AND THE
DESIRE TO POSSESS WOMEN.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.860
DOES THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT
- OR ANY OTHER FOR THAT

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.700
MATTER - FIGHT AGAINST
THE KILLING OF WOMEN

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.860
WITH THE SAME
INTENSITY AS IT DOES

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.900
AGAINST, FOR
INSTANCE, TERRORISM?

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.530
WITHOUT A DOUBT, NO.

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:39.630
AND THE DATA IS
DISHEARTENING.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.400
IN RECENT YEARS DEATHS
DUE TO TERRORISM CAN BE

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.060
COUNTED IN THE THOUSANDS
WHILE FEMICIDES

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:51.200
CAN BE COUNTED IN THE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS.

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:32.000
IN THE YEAR 2000, 189
COUNTRIES SIGNED THE

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.560
U.N.-SPONSORED
MILLENNIUM OBJECTIVES.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.760
THERE WERE SEVEN
SUCH OBJECTIVES:

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.930
THE ERADICATION
OF EXTREME POVERTY,

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:42.160
UNIVERSAL PRIMARY
EDUCATION, GENDER EQUALITY,

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.800
A REDUCTION IN
INFANT MORTALITY RATES,

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.030
MATERNAL HEALTH,
THE FIGHT AGAINST AIDS,

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:50.730
AND SUSTAINABLE
ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT,

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:52.560
PLUS ACCESS TO WATER.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.260
IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH
THESE, AN EIGHTH ENTRY

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.760
WAS CREATED CALLED
"ALLIANCE FOR DEVELOPMENT".

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.500
ACCORDING TO
THIS LAST POINT

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.800
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
WOULD INCREASE THEIR AID,

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.500
WOULD REDUCE THE EXTERNAL
DEBT OF POOR COUNTRIES,

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.060
AND WOULD REGULATE COMMERCE
SO THAT THEIR MARKETS

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:10.730
COULD BE OPEN TO THESE
LESS ADVANTAGED NATIONS.

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:13.030
THE DEADLINE SET
FOR THESE OBJECTIVES

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:15.000
WAS THE YEAR 2015.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.300
WE CAN ALREADY ASSERT
THAT THEY WILL NOT BE

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.260
ACCOMPLISHED BY THEN.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.260
THERE IS SOME DATA
THAT OFFERS HOPE -

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.430
SOME PARTIAL
VICTORIES IN COUNTRIES

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:25.400
SUCH AS
CHINA AND INDIA.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.430
BUT WE ARE VERY
FAR FROM ACHIEVING

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:28.100
EVEN MODEST RESULTS.

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.000
AFRICA HAS
BECOME STAGNANT.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.130
THERE ARE STILL
11 MILLION CHILDREN

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:34.360
DYING BEFORE THE AGE
OF FIVE IN THE WORLD

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.530
AND IN AFRICA THIS
MORTALITY RATE

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:38.900
HAS INCREASED
SINCE THE 1990'S.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.530
IN SOME PARTS
OF LATIN AMERICA

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:44.800
POVERTY DOES NOT
DECREASE, IT INCREASES.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:01.300
TODAY EXPERTS AGREE THAT
THERE ARE SOLUTIONS TO THE

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.130
PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPMENT
AND THAT THE MILLENNIUM

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:07.760
OBJECTIVES ARE TECHNICALLY
AND ECONOMICALLY VIABLE.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:12.100
ALL THAT IS NEEDED IS THE
POLITICAL WILL OF NATIONS.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.430
GOVERNMENTS OF
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:17.760
MUST STRENGTHEN HUMAN
RIGHTS AND FIGHT CORRUPTION.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.760
RICHER GOVERNMENTS MUST
SIMPLY HONOR WHAT THEY'VE

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.860
AGREED TO AND HONOR THEIR
HISTORIC RESPONSIBILITY.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:29.430
SOMETHING THAT
HAS YET TO OCCUR.

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:32.430
EXTERNAL DEBT STILL
DROWNS MANY COUNTRIES.

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:35.130
FAIR TRADE NORMS ARE STILL
UP IN THE AIR AND THE

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:39.900
NECESSARY INVESTMENTS
HAVE NOT TAKEN PLACE.

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.560
THE U.N. INSISTS THAT
RICH COUNTRIES MUST

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.400
DOUBLE THE AID THEY
CURRENTLY GIVE IN ORDER TO

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:49.330
ACCOMPLISH THE MILLENNIUM
OBJECTIVES BY 2025.

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:51.560
AT THE CURRENT PACE
SOME OF THE OBJECTIVES

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:56.630
WON'T BE ACCOMPLISHED
UNTIL 2150.

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.830
AID MUST BE
INCREASED, YES.

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:16.030
AND IT IS ALSO TRUE
THAT THE CONCEPT OF

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:18.530
HOW AID IS USED
MUST BE CLARIFIED.

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:21.000
BUT THE KEY TO
REAL GROWTH IS IN THE

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.300
REGULATORY SYSTEM OF
INTERNATIONAL TRADE.

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.760
IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO
FREE UP OPPORTUNITIES

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:33.030
SO THAT POORER ECONOMIES
CAN EXPORT THEIR PRODUCTS.

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:35.300
AID IS A NECESSARY
QUICK FIX

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.060
BUT COMMERCE CREATES
LASTING OPPORTUNITY.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.930
GRANTING DEVELOPING NATIONS
ACCESS TO DECISION MAKING

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:43.600
FORUMS IN THE WORLD
TRADE ORGANIZATION

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.600
IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.530
SOME COUNTRIES HAVE
ALREADY ACHIEVED THIS

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:48.730
WITH GOOD RESULTS.

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:50.330
BUT MOST ARE
LAGGING BEHIND,

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:55.460
ESPECIALLY THOSE IN
SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:39.660
EVERY DAY MORE PEOPLE
IN MORE COUNTRIES

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:42.960
DEMAND THE SAME
LIFESTYLE THEY SEE ON TV,

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.660
THE SAME CAR MODELS
AND CLOTHING BRANDS.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.230
EVERY DAY MORE PEOPLE
ASPIRE TO EAT MEAT

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:50.700
ON A DAILY BASIS,
TO SHOWER DAILY,

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:54.730
AND TO TRAVEL BY PLANE
TO VISIT THEIR FAMILIES.

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:57.360
IT IS NOT NECESSARY
FOR THE POPULATION

00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.230
TO CONTINUE GROWING,

00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:01.600
ALTHOUGH WITH MORE
THAN SIX BILLION PEOPLE

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.760
POPULATION GROWTH
IS ALMOST INEVITABLE.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.200
AND IF ONLY BRAZIL,
INDIA AND CHINA

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.900
- THREE HEAVILY POPULATED
COUNTRIES ON THE RISE -

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.860
CREATE ACCESS TO
MARKET ECONOMIES,

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:13.130
THE RESULTING
ENVIRONMENTAL HARM

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:20.300
COULD BE DEFINITE
AND IRREPARABLE.

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.960
THE DILEMMA IS IN COVERING
THE NEEDS OF THE BILLIONS

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.260
OF NEEDY WITHOUT EXCEEDING
THE PLANET'S ECOLOGICAL

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:31.030
LIMITS WHILE UNDOING
PATTERNS OF INEQUALITY

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:35.530
AND DISTRIBUTING WEALTH IN
A MORE BALANCED FASHION.

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:38.030
HOW DO WE FACE THE
CHALLENGE OF THE DEVELOPMENT

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:40.160
OF THREE QUARTERS OF
THE WORLD'S POPULATION

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.060
WITHOUT EXCEEDING
ECOLOGICAL LIMITS?

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.060
THE SOLUTION IS NOT
SIMPLE, BUT IT MUST

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:46.500
INVOLVE SOME SORT OF
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:49.000
THAT GUARANTEES ACCESS
TO PROPERTY FOR THE POOR

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.730
AS WELL AS
TO EDUCATION

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.560
AND TRANSPORTATION
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.200
SHORING UP CONFIDENCE
IN BALANCED COMMERCIAL

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.700
COMPETITION AND PROTECTING
THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS

00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:59.830
WHILE SAFEGUARDING
THE ENVIRONMENT

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:02.260
ARE ALSO ESSENTIAL
PRIORITIES.

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.500
AND WHAT MUST FIRST
WORLD CITIZENS DO?

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.030
THE SOLUTION
IS IN OUR HANDS,

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:05.260
IN THE DECISIONS WE MAKE,
IN THE VOTES WE CAST.

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.730
NOWADAYS, FROM A PURELY
TECHNOLOGICAL STANDPOINT,

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:10.760
THESE OBJECTIVES
ARE REACHABLE.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:13.430
TO MAKE THEM A REALITY IS
A QUESTION OF POLITICAL

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:15.430
AND PERSONAL WILL
AND A REALIZATION

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:17.560
THAT THE BIGGEST
DANGER HUMANITY FACES

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.800
IS NOT TERRORISM
OR DRUG TRAFFICKING

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:24.930
BUT POVERTY AND
ENVIRONMENTAL DETERIORATION.

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:27.000
LET US CHANGE THE
WAY WE CONSUME.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.060
LET'S USE MORE PUBLIC
TRANSPORTATION.

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:31.760
LET'S RELY MORE ON
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.600
LET'S PRESSURE OUR
GOVERNMENTS INTO

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.460
UNDERSTANDING THAT
AID FOR DEVELOPMENT

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:38.060
IS NOT JUST A PROCESS
TO CLEAR OUR CONSCIENCE.

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.530
LET'S ACCEPT THAT IT IS
NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:43.400
TO OWN TWO HOMES, THREE
CARS, FOUR TV SETS AND TO

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.560
CHANGE CELL PHONES OR
COMPUTERS EVERY SIX MONTHS.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.660
LET'S CONSUME
- NAY, LET'S LIVE -

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:55.800
IN A SUSTAINABLE
FASHION.

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.430
ON THE STREETS OF GREAT
FIRST WORLD METROPOLIS

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:01.630
THE MISERY IN AFRICA
OR THE DETERIORATION

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:03.760
OF RIVERS,
SEAS AND FARMLAND

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.000
MIGHT SEEM LIKE
A REMOTE PROBLEM.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.060
BUT NOTHING IS FURTHER
FROM THE TRUTH.

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:10.760
PESTICIDES THAT
CONTAMINATE FARMLANDS

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.360
OR PANDEMIC DISEASES
SUCH AS AIDS IN AFRICA

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.460
HAVE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES
ON OUR DAILY LIVES.

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:18.660
AND IT ISN'T EVEN
A QUESTION ANYMORE

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:20.800
OF SOLIDARITY WITH
OTHER HUMAN BEINGS

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.730
BUT, IF YOU WILL,
OF SELF-PROTECTION.

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:26.000
IF WE ARE INCAPABLE
OF JUMP STARTING

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.130
THE MECHANISMS THAT
WILL ALLOW TWO-THIRDS

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:30.130
OF THE POPULATION
TO BECOME DEVELOPED

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:32.360
AND IF THAT DEVELOPMENT
IS NOT SUSTAINABLE,

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.000
WHAT IS AT
STAKE IS NOT THE

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.600
TYPE OF FUTURE
WE ARE FORGING

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:43.960
BUT THE VERY FUTURE
OF OUR SPECIES.
