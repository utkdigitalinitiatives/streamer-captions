00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:36.000


2
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.270
Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.

3
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.830
Is this a holiday?

4
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.070
What, know you not you ought not walk

5
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.000
upon a laboring day without the sign of your profession?

6
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.330
Speak.

7
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.430
What trade art thou?

8
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.070
Why, sir, a carpenter.

9
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.130
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?

10
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.600
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?

11
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.770
You, sir, what trade are you?

12
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.330
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman,

13
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.970
I am but, as you would say, a cobbler.

14
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.130
But what trade art thou?

15
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.570
Answer me directly.

16
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.100
A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe conscience,

17
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.830
which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.

18
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.500
What trade, thou knave?

19
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.730
Thou naughty knave, what trade?

20
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.400
I beseech you, sir, be not out with me;

21
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.530
yet, if you be out, sir, I can mend you.

22
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.600
What mean'st thou by that?

23
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.070
Mend me, thou saucy fellow!

24
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.570
Why, sir, cobble you.

25
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.900
Thou art a cobbler, art thou?

26
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.570
Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the awl;

27
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.430
I meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's matters,

28
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.870
but with awl.

29
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.400
I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes;

30
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.430
when they're in great danger, I recover them.

31
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.970
as proper men as ever trod upon neat's leather

32
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.300
have gone upon my handiwork.

33
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.800
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?

34
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.900
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?

35
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.470
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes

36
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.600
to get myself into more work.

37
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.030
But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesar

38
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.670
and to rejoice in his triumph.

39
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.200
Caesar! Caesar!

40
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.230
Wherefore rejoice?

41
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.430
What conquest brings he home?

42
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.500
What tributaries follow him to Rome

43
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.800
to grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?

44
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.000
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!

45
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.330
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,

46
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.600
knew you not Pompey?

47
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.330
Many a time and oft have you climb'd up to walls

48
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.770
and battlements, to towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,

49
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.300
your infants in your arms,

50
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.230
and there have sat the livelong day in patient expectation

51
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.930
to see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.

52
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.170
and when you saw his chariot but appear,

53
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.430
have you not made an universal shout

54
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.200
that Tiber trembled underneath her banks

55
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.930
to hear the replication of your sounds

56
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.500
made in her concave shores?

57
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.870
and do you now put on your best attire?

58
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.770
and do you now cull out a holiday?

59
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.070
and do you now strew flowers in his way

60
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.600
that comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?

61
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.370
Be gone!

62
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.730
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,

63
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.330
pray to the gods to intermit the plague

64
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.670
that needs must light on this ingratitude.

65
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.000
Go, go, good countrymen.

66
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.600
For this fault, assemble all the poor men of your sort,

67
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.000
draw them to Tiber banks,

68
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.200
and weep your tears into the channel,

69
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.400
till the lowest stream do kiss the most exalted shore of all.

70
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.230
See whether their basest metal be not moved;

71
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.200
They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.

72
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.930
Go you down that way towards the Capitol;

73
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.200
this way will I.

74
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.700
Disrobe the images if you do find them

75
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.870
deck'd with ceremonies.

76
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.970
May we do so?

77
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.330
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.

78
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.200
It is no matter; let no images be hung with Caesar's trophies.

79
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.670
I'll about and drive away the vulgar from the streets;

80
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.130
so do you too, where you perceive them thick.

81
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.300
These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing

82
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.870
will make him fly an ordinary pitch,

83
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.830
who else would soar above the view of men

84
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.600
and keep us all in servile fearfulness.

85
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.500
Hail, Caesar!

86
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.500
Hail, Caesar!

87
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.570
Caesar!

88
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.470
Hail, Caesar!

89
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.470
Peace, ho!

90
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.070
Caesar speaks.

91
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.170
Calpurnia.

92
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.300
Here, my lord.

93
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.930
Stand you directly in Antonio's way,

94
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.870
when he doth run his course.

95
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.000
Antonios.

96
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.500
Caesar, my lord?

97
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.100
Forget not in your speed, Antonio, to touch Calpurnia,

98
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.300
for our elders say the barren, touched in this holy chase,

99
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.400
shake off their sterile curse.

100
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.270
I shall remember.

101
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.670
When Caesar says "Do this," it is perform'd.

102
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.900
Set on, and leave no ceremony out.

103
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.930
Caesar!

104
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:04.770
Haaaaaaaaa!

105
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.400
Bid every noise be still!

106
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.870
Peace yet again!

107
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.400
Who is it in the press that calls on me?

108
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.500
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music, cry "Caesar."

109
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.670
Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.

110
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.830
Beware the ides of March!

111
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.300
What man is that?

112
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.870
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.

113
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.470
Set him before me; let me see his face.

114
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.370
Fellow, come from the throng.

115
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.670
Look upon Caesar.

116
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.030
What say'st thou to me now?

117
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.330
Speak once again.

118
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.900
Beware the ides of March.

119
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.830
He is a dreamer; let us leave him.

120
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.130
Pass.

121
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.170
Will you go see the order of the course?

122
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.270
Not I.

123
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.370
I pray you, do.

124
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.470
I am not gamesome; I do lack some part

125
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.530
of that quick spirit that is in Antony.

126
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.500
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires; I'll leave you.

127
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:57.000
Brutus, I do observe you now of late;

128
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.800
I have not from your eyes that gentleness and show of love

129
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.470
as I was wont to have.

130
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.100
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand

131
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.570
over your friend that loves you.

132
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:11.930
Cassius, be not deceived; if I have veil'd my look,

133
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.130
I turn the trouble of my countenance merely upon myself.

134
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:19.430
Vexed I am of late with passions of some difference,

135
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.330
conceptions only proper to myself,

136
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.670
which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;

137
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.470
but let not therefore my good friends be grieved--

138
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.530
among which number, Cassius, be you one--

139
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.230
nor construe any further my neglect than that poor Brutus

140
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:36.830
with himself at war forgets the shows of love to other men.

141
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.500
Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,

142
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.430
by means whereof this breast of mine

143
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.030
hath buried thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.

144
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.070
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?

145
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.200
No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself but by reflection,

146
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.770
by some other things.

147
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:02.070
'Tis just, and it is very much lamented, Brutus,

148
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.300
that you have no such mirrors

149
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.530
as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye

150
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.530
that you may see your shadow.

151
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:11.300
I have heard where many of the best respect in Rome,

152
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.730
except immortal Caesar,

153
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.330
speaking of Brutus and groaning underneath this age's yoke,

154
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.170
have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.

155
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.530
Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,

156
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.400
that you would have me seek into myself

157
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.830
for that which is not in me?

158
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.170
Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,

159
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.700
and since you know you cannot see yourself

160
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.930
so well as by reflection,

161
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.130
I your glass will modestly discover to yourself

162
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:41.770
that of yourself which you yet know not of.

163
00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.170
and be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus;

164
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.830
were I a common laugther,

165
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.230
or did use to stale with ordinary oaths

166
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.830
my love to every new protester,

167
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.030
if you know that I do fawn on men and hug them hard

168
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.530
and after scandal them,

169
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.200
or if you know that I profess myself

170
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.370
in banqueting to all the rout, then hold me dangerous.

171
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.900
What means this shouting?

172
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.530
I do fear the people choose Caesar for their king.

173
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.830
Ay, do you fear it?

174
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.070
Then must I think you would not have it so.

175
00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:24.000
I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.

176
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.800
Wherefore do you hold me here so long?

177
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.000
What is it that you would impart to me?

178
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.930
If it be aught toward the general good,

179
00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.470
set honor in one eye and death in the other

180
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.400
and I will look on both indifferently.

181
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.670
Let the gods so speed me as I do love the name of honor

182
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.930
more than I fear death.

183
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.930
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,

184
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.770
as well as I do know your outward favor.

185
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:52.400
Well, honor is the subject of my story.

186
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.070
I cannot tell what you and other men think of this life,

187
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.670
but, for my single self, I had as lief not be

188
00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.800
as live to be in awe of such a thing as I myself.

189
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.900
I was born free as Caesar; so were you;

190
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.070
we both have fed as well,

191
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.700
and we can both endure the winter's cold as well as he.

192
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.770
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,

193
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.430
the troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me,

194
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:22.830
"Darest thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood

195
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.070
and swim to yonder point?"

196
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.400
Upon the word, accoutred as I was,

197
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.000
I plunged in and bade him follow.

198
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.270
So indeed he did.

199
00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:37.500
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it with lusty sinews,

200
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.970
throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controversy.

201
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.100
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,

202
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.970
Caesar cried, "Help me, Cassius, or I sink!"

203
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:53.000
I, as Aeneas our great ancestor did from the flames of Troy

204
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.200
upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear,

205
00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.100
so from the waves of Tiber did I the tired Caesar.

206
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.930
And this man is now become a god,

207
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:07.570
and Cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body

208
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.830
if Caesar carelessly but nod on him.

209
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.070
He had a fever when he was in Spain,

210
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.430
and when the fit was on him, I did mark how he did shake.

211
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.400
And 'Tis true, this god did shake;

212
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.970
His coward lips did from their color fly,

213
00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.130
and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world

214
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.800
did lose his luster.

215
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.300
I did hear him groan.

216
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.800
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans mark him

217
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.900
and write his speeches in their books,

218
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.570
alas, it cried, "Give me some drink, Titinius,"

219
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.630
as a sick girl.

220
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.800
Ye gods, it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper

221
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.700
should so get the start of the majestic world

222
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.170
and bear the palm alone.

223
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.230
Another general shout.

224
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.530
I do believe that these applauses

225
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.300
are for some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar.

226
00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.330
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a Colossus,

227
00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.330
and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about

228
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.530
to find ourselves dishonorable graves.

229
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.230
Men at some time are masters of their fates:

230
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:39.130
the fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,

231
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:44.170
But in ourselves that we are underlings.

232
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:48.670
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that "Caesar"?

233
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.470
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?

234
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.970
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;

235
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.930
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;

236
00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.170
Weigh them, it is as heavy;

237
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.930
conjure with 'em, "Brutus" will start a spirit

238
00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.030
as soon as "Caesar."

239
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.000
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,

240
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.300
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed

241
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.930
that he is grown so great?

242
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.900
Oh, Age, thou art shamed!

243
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.030
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!

244
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.070
When went there by an age since the great flood

245
00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.400
but it was famed with more than with one man?

246
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.000
When could they say till now that talk'd of Rome

247
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.430
that her wide walls encompass'd but one man?

248
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.730
Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,

249
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:35.830
when there is in it but one only man.

250
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:45.130
You and I have heard our fathers say there was a Brutus once

251
00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.100
who would have brook'd the eternal devil

252
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:51.300
to keep his state in Rome as easily as a king.

253
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:04.600
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;

254
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.830
What you would work me to, I have some aim.

255
00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:11.200
How I have thought of this and of these times,

256
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.830
I shall recount hereafter; for this present, I would not,

257
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:18.500
so with love I might entreat you, be any further moved.

258
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.830
What you have said I will consider;

259
00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.470
what you have to say I will with patience hear,

260
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.000
and find a time both meet to hear

261
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.700
and answer such high things.

262
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.000
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:

263
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.070
Brutus had rather be a villager

264
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.070
than to repute himself a son of Rome under these hard conditions

265
00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.070
as this time is like to lay upon us.

266
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.730
I am glad that my weak words

267
00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.500
have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.

268
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.130
The games are done, and Caesar is returning.

269
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.470
As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,

270
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.170
and he will, after his sour fashion,

271
00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.170
tell you what hath proceeded worthy note today.

272
00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.470
I will do so.

273
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:07.900
But, look you, Cassius,

274
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.470
the angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,

275
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.200
and all the rest look like a chidden train:

276
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.070
Calpurnia's cheek is pale,

277
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:17.630
and Cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes

278
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.130
as we have seen him in the Capitol,

279
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.400
being cross'd in conference by some senators.

280
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.870
Casca will tell us what the matter is.

281
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.030
Antonios.

282
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.400
Caesar?

283
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:44.600
Let me have men about me that are fat, sleek-headed men,

284
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.000
and such as sleep o' nights:

285
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.330
yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;

286
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:54.000
he thinks too much; such men are dangerous.

287
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.570
Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;

288
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.100
he's a noble Roman and well given.

289
00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.500
Would he were fatter!

290
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:04.370
But I fear him not, yet if my name were liable to fear,

291
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.970
I do not know the man I should avoid so soon

292
00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.330
as that spare Cassius.

293
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.670
He reads much, he is a great observer,

294
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.000
and he looks quite through the deeds of men.

295
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.170
He loves no plays, as thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;

296
00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:24.770
seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort

297
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.670
as if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit

298
00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:32.100
that could be moved to smile at anything.

299
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.530
Such men as he be never at heart's ease

300
00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:37.700
whiles they behold a greater than themselves,

301
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:42.070
and therefore are they very dangerous.

302
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:46.670
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd than what I fear,

303
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.000
for always I am Caesar.

304
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:58.530
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,

305
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.230
and tell me truly what thou think'st of him.

306
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.800
Would you speak with me?

307
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.530
Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today

308
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.170
that Caesar looks so sad.

309
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.670
Why, you were with him, were you not?

310
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.070
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.

311
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:19.930
Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,

312
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.930
he put it by with the back of his hand, thus,

313
00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.300
and then the people fell ashouting.

314
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.600
What was the second noise for?

315
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.500
Why, for that too.

316
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.000
They shouted thrice.

317
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.830
What was the last cry for?

318
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.430
Why, for that too.

319
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.770
Was the crown offered him thrice?

320
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.830
Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice,

321
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.900
every time gentler than other,

322
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:51.200
and at every putting by mine honest neighbors shouted.

323
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.830
Who offered him the crown?

324
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.230
Why, Antony.

325
00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.670
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.

326
00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.730
I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it.

327
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.770
It was mere foolery; I did not mark it.

328
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.430
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown,

329
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:12.430
yet 'twas not a crown neither; 'twas one of these coronets.

330
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.430
And, as I told you, he put it by once.

331
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.070
But for all that,

332
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.930
to my thinking, he would fain have had it.

333
00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.570
Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by again.

334
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:28.100
But, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.

335
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.570
And then he offered it the third time;

336
00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.570
he put it the third time by;

337
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.700
and still as he refused it, the rabblement hooted

338
00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.030
and clapped their chopped hands

339
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.570
and threw up their sweaty nightcaps

340
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.530
and uttered such a deal of stinking breath

341
00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.030
because Caesar refused the crown

342
00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:44.770
that it had almost choked Caesar,

343
00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.600
for he swounded and fell down at it.

344
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.770
And for mine own part, I durst not laugh

345
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.030
for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.

346
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.830
But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?

347
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.000
He fell down in the marketplace

348
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.670
and foamed at mouth and was speechless.

349
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.270
'Tis very like.

350
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.700
He hath the falling sickness.

351
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.430
No, Caesar hath it not, but you and I and honest Casca,

352
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:09.330
we have the falling sickness.

353
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.830
I know not what you mean by that,

354
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.030
but I am sure Caesar fell down.

355
00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:17.270
If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him

356
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.600
according as he pleased and displeased them,

357
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.630
as they use to do the players in the theatre, I am no true man.

358
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.370
What said he when he came unto himself?

359
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.700
Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived

360
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.630
the common herd was glad he refused the crown,

361
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.830
he plucked me ope his doublet

362
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.000
and offered them his throat to cut.

363
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.930
And I'd been a man of any occupation,

364
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:39.270
if I had not taken him at a word,

365
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.230
I would I might go to hell among the rogues.

366
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.770
And so he fell.

367
00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.830
And when he came to himself again,

368
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:49.200
he said, if he had done or said anything amiss,

369
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.900
he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity.

370
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.700
Three or four wenches where I stood cried, "Alas, good soul!"

371
00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.830
and forgave him with all their hearts.

372
00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.670
But there's no heed to be taken of them;

373
00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.700
if Caesar had stabbed their mothers,

374
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.070
they would have done no less.

375
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.730
And after that he came, thus sad, away?

376
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.830
Ay.

377
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.000
Did Cicero say anything?

378
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.470
Ay, he spoke Greek.

379
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.070
To what effect?

380
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.170
Nay, an I tell you that,

381
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:15.500
I'll ne'er look you i' the face again;

382
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.900
but those that understood him smiled at one another

383
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.470
and shook their heads;

384
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.900
but for mine own part, it was Greek to me.

385
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.670
I could tell you more news too:

386
00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.300
Marullus and Flavius,

387
00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.500
for pulling scarfs off Caesar's images,

388
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.000
are put to silence.

389
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.170
Fare you well.

390
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.730
There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it.

391
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.930
Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?

392
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.170
No, I am promised forth.

393
00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.670
Then will you dine with me tomorrow?

394
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:55.730
Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold,

395
00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:57.530
and your dinner worth the eating.

396
00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:59.070
Good, I will expect you.

397
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.300
Do so.

398
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.400
Farewell, both.

399
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.570
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be.

400
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.530
He was quick mettle when he went to school.

401
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:14.230
So is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise.

402
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.430
However, he puts on this tardy form.

403
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.600
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,

404
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.730
which gives men stomach to digest his words

405
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:22.900
with better appetite.

406
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.130
And so it is.

407
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.730
For this time I will leave you.

408
00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.530
Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,

409
00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.900
I will come home to you, or, if you will, come home to me

410
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.000
and I will wait for you.

411
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.230
I will do so.

412
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:39.270
Till then...think of the world.

413
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:50.630
Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see thy honorable mettle

414
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.870
may be wrought from that it is disposed;

415
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:56.030
therefore it is meet that noble minds

416
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.470
keep ever with their likes;

417
00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:02.330
For who so firm that cannot be seduced?

418
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:09.100
Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.

419
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:13.130
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius, he should not humor me.

420
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:18.800
I will this night, in several hands, in at his windows throw,

421
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.770
as if they came from several citizens, writings,

422
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:25.300
all tending to the great opinion that Rome holds of his name,

423
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:30.630
wherein obscurely Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at.

424
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:33.300
And after this let Caesar seat him sure;

425
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:40.800
for we will shake him, or worse days endure.

426
00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.130
Good even, Casca.

427
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.570
Brought you Caesar home?

428
00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.300
Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?

429
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:16.070
Are not you moved, when all the sway of eart

430
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.500
shakes like a thing unfirm?

431
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.070
O Cicero, I have seen tempests

432
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.630
when the scolding winds have rived the knotty oaks,

433
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.900
and I have seen the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam

434
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:31.400
to be exalted with the threatening clouds,

435
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.670
but never till tonight, never till now,

436
00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.100
did I go through a tempest dropping fire.

437
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.600
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,

438
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.000
or else the world too saucy with the gods

439
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.730
incenses them to send destruction.

440
00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:52.930
Why, saw you anything ore wonderful?

441
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.430
A common slave-- you know him well by sight--

442
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.530
held up his left hand,

443
00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:01.830
which did flame and burn like twenty torches join'd,

444
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:07.630
and yet his hand not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd.

445
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:11.670
Besides, I ha' not since put up my sword.

446
00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:16.630
Against the Capitol I met a lion, who glaz'd upon me

447
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.700
and went surly by without annoying me.

448
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.470
And there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women

449
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.270
transformed with their fear, who swore they saw men all in fire

450
00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:29.470
walk up and down the streets.

451
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:46.430
And yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noonday

452
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:50.570
upon the marketplace, hooting and shrieking.

453
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.170
When these prodigies do so conjointly meet,

454
00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.030
let not men say "These are their reasons; they are natural":

455
00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:58.370
For I believe they are portentous things

456
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.700
unto the climate that they point upon.

457
00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:05.800
Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.

458
00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:14.300
But men may construe things after their fashion,

459
00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.330
clean from the purpose of the things themselves.

460
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.500
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?

461
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.870
He doth, for he did bid Antonios send word to you

462
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:27.030
he would be there tomorrow.

463
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.370
Goodbye then, Casca.

464
00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:36.370
This disturbed sky is not to walk in.

465
00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:38.130
Farewell, Cicero.

466
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.700
Who's there?

467
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.800
A Roman.

468
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.830
Casca, by your voice.

469
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.770
Your ear is good.

470
00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:58.230
Cassius, what night is this!

471
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.570
A very pleasing night to honest men.

472
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:02.800
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?

473
00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.070
Those that have known the earth so full of faults.

474
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:08.270
For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,

475
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.200
submitting me unto the perilous night,

476
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.230
and thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,

477
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:14.300
have bared my bosom to the thunderstone;

478
00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.130
and when the cross blue lightning

479
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:18.470
seem'd to open the breast of heaven,

480
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.270
I did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it.

481
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:24.970
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?

482
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:28.070
It is the part of men to fear and tremble

483
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.470
when the most mighty gods by tokens

484
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:33.030
send such dreadful heralds to astonish us.

485
00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.670
You are dull, Casca,

486
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.600
and those sparks of life that should be in a Roman

487
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.900
you do want, or else you use not.

488
00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.570
You look pale and gaze and put on fear

489
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.470
and cast yourself in wonder

490
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.800
to see the strange impatience of the heavens.

491
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:55.700
But if you would consider the true cause why all these fires,

492
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.100
why all these gliding ghosts,

493
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.070
why birds and beasts from quality and kind,

494
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:05.530
why old men, fools, and children calculate,

495
00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:08.400
Why all these things change from their ordinance,

496
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:14.700
their natures, and preformed faculties to monstrous quality,

497
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:19.030
why, you shall find that heaven hath infused them

498
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.870
with these spirits to make them instruments of fear and warning

499
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.800
unto some monstrous state.

500
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.130
Now could I, Casca,

501
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.470
name to thee a man most like this dreadful night,

502
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.470
that thunders, lightens, opens graves,

503
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:33.370
and roars as doth the lion in the Capitol,

504
00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:37.100
a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action,

505
00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.300
yet prodigious grown and fearful,

506
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.000
as these strange eruptions are.

507
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.770
'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?

508
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:46.230
Let it be who it is,

509
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:50.130
for Romans now have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.

510
00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:51.900
But, woe the while!

511
00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.370
Our fathers' minds are dead,

512
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.170
and we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;

513
00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:00.370
our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.

514
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:03.570
Indeed they say the senators tomorrow

515
00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:06.400
mean to establish Caesar as a king,

516
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.900
and he shall wear his crown by sea and land

517
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.900
in every place save here in Italy.

518
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.570
I know where I will wear this dagger then:

519
00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:22.000
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.

520
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.500
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;

521
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.130
therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.

522
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:31.870
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,

523
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.170
nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron

524
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.430
can be retentive to the strength of spirit;

525
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.830
but life, being weary of these worldly bars,

526
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:42.100
never lacks power to dismiss itself.

527
00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.130
If I know this, know all the world besides,

528
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.070
that part of tyranny that I do bear

529
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.630
I can shake off at pleasure.

530
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:50.000
So can I.

531
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.800
So every bondman in his own hand

532
00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.970
bears the power to cancel his captivity.

533
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:58.770
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?

534
00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.670
Poor man.

535
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:01.870
I know he would not be a wolf

536
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:03.970
but that he sees the Romans are but sheep.

537
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:06.970
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.

538
00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:09.570
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire

539
00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:11.270
begin it with weak straws.

540
00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:15.430
What trash is Rome, what rubbish, and what offal,

541
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.870
when it serves for the base matter

542
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:20.900
to illuminate so vile a thing as Caesar?

543
00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.970
Grief, where hast thou led me?

544
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:30.530
I perhaps speak this before a willing bondman;

545
00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:33.500
then I know my answer must be made.

546
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:38.270
But I am arm'd, and dangers are to me indifferent.

547
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.070
You speak to Casca,

548
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.770
and to such a man that is no fleering tell-tale.

549
00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.370
Hold my hand.

550
00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:48.630
Be factious for redress of all these griefs,

551
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:50.030
and I will set this foot of mine

552
00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:51.300
as far as who goes farthest.

553
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.030
Ay, there's a bargain made.

554
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:57.330
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already

555
00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:59.330
some certain of the noblest-minded Romans

556
00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:00.670
to undergo with me an enterprise

557
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:02.670
of honorable, dangerous consequence;

558
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.170
and I do know by this, they stay for me in Pompey's Porch.

559
00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:11.130
For now, this fearful night,

560
00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:12.830
there is no stir or walking in the streets,

561
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.970
and the complexion of the element in favor's

562
00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:16.930
like the work we have in hand,

563
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:19.930
most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.

564
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:22.100
Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.

565
00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.430
'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait; he is a friend.

566
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:26.700
Cinna, where haste you so?

567
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.970
To find out you.

568
00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:29.430
Who's that?

569
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:30.630
Metellus Cimber?

570
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:34.600
No, it is Casca, one incorporate to our attempts.

571
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.200
Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?

572
00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.600
I am glad on't.

573
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.870
What a fearful night is this!

574
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:43.330
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.

575
00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:44.530
Am I not stay'd for?

576
00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:45.630
Tell me.

577
00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:46.900
Yes, you are.

578
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:51.400
O Cassius, if you could but win the noble Brutus to our party--

579
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.530
Be you content.

580
00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:54.970
Good Cinna, take this paper,

581
00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.670
and look you lay it in the praetor's chair,

582
00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:00.100
where Brutus may but find it; and throw this in at his window;

583
00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.170
set this up with wax upon old Brutus' statue.

584
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.600
All this done, repair to Pompey's Porch,

585
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.700
where you shall find us.

586
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.670
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?

587
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:08.970
All but Metellus Cimber,

588
00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:10.970
and he's gone to seek you at your house.

589
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.270
Well, I will hie and so bestow these papers as you bade me.

590
00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.600
That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.

591
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.530
Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day see Brutus at his house.

592
00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:24.130
Three parts of him is ours already,

593
00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:26.700
and the man entire on the next encounter yields him ours.

594
00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.300
O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,

595
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.770
and that which would appear offense in us,

596
00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:34.530
His countenance, like richest alchemy,

597
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.470
will change to virtue and to worthiness.

598
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:38.800
Him and his worth and our great need of him

599
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.330
you have right well conceited.

600
00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:43.830
Let us go, for it is after midnight,

601
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:46.670
and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him.

602
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.470
What, Lucius, ho!

603
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.030
I cannot, by the progress of the stars,

604
00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:07.400
give guess how near to day.

605
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.770
Lucius, I say!

606
00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:14.600
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.

607
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.730
When, Lucius, when?

608
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:18.000
Awake, I say!

609
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.270
What, Lucius!

610
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:20.900
Call'd you, my lord?

611
00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.630
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.

612
00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:24.230
When it is lighted, come and call me here.

613
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:25.870
I will, my lord.

614
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:41.030
It must be by his death, and, for my part,

615
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.070
I know no personal cause to spurn at him,

616
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:46.170
but for the general.

617
00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:47.700
He would be crown'd:

618
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:52.530
how that might change his nature, there's the question.

619
00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:55.930
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder

620
00:34:55.930 --> 00:34:59.330
and that craves wary walking.

621
00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:03.800
Crown him that,

622
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.230
and then, I grant, we put a sting in him

623
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.970
that at his will he may do danger with.

624
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:16.170
The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power,

625
00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.170
and, to speak truth of Caesar,

626
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:19.370
I have not known when his affections

627
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.470
sway'd more than his reason.

628
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:23.370
But 'tis a common proof

629
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:25.900
that lowliness is young ambition's ladder,

630
00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.800
whereto the climber-upward turns his face;

631
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.870
but when he once attains the upmost round,

632
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:35.030
he then unto the ladder turns his back, looks in the clouds,

633
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:39.630
scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend.

634
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:49.030
So Caesar may; then, lest he may, prevent.

635
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:52.470
And, since the quarrel will bear no color for the thing he is,

636
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:56.970
fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,

637
00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:00.730
would run to these and these extremities;

638
00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:03.300
and therefore think him as a serpent's egg

639
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:07.000
which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,

640
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.300
and kill him in the shell.

641
00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.100
The taper burneth in your closet, sir.

642
00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.800
Searching the window for a flint

643
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.030
I found this paper thus seal'd up,

644
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:20.570
and I am sure it did not lie there when I went to bed.

645
00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:23.600
Get you to bed again, it is not day.

646
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.600
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?

647
00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.270
I know not, sir.

648
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:30.470
Look in the calendar and bring me word.

649
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:31.900
I will, sir.

650
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:45.430
"Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself.

651
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:48.670
Shall Rome, et cetera.

652
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:53.600
Speak, strike, redress!"

653
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:58.930
"Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake."

654
00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:01.200
Such instigations have been often dropp'd

655
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.330
where I have took them up.

656
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.970
"Shall Rome, et cetera."

657
00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:13.570
Thus must I piece it out.

658
00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:19.800
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe?

659
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.000
What, Rome?

660
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.400
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome

661
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.900
the Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.

662
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:35.870
"Speak, strike, redress."

663
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:39.570
Am I entreated to speak and strike?

664
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:50.870
O Rome, I make thee promise, if the redress will follow,

665
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:55.470
thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!

666
00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:58.430
Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.

667
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:59.930
'Tis good.

668
00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:04.070
Go to the gate, somebody knocks.

669
00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:08.070
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar I have not slept.

670
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:11.470
Between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion,

671
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:15.130
all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream;

672
00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:19.430
the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council,

673
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:21.770
and the state of man, like to a little kingdom,

674
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:25.070
suffers then the nature of an insurrection.

675
00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:27.730
Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,

676
00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:28.830
who doth desire to see you.

677
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:30.000
Is he alone?

678
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.370
No, sir, there are more with him.

679
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:32.670
Do you know them?

680
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.600
No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,

681
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.830
and half their faces buried in their cloaks,

682
00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:40.800
that by no means I may discover them by any mark of favor.

683
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.100
Let 'em enter.

684
00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.400
They are the faction.

685
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.600
O Conspiracy, shamest thou

686
00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.400
to show thy dangerous brow by night,

687
00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.000
when evils are most free?

688
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.400
O, then, by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough

689
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.470
to mask thy monstrous visage?

690
00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:00.970
Seek none, Conspiracy; hide it in smiles and affability;

691
00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:04.700
for if thou path, thy native semblance on,

692
00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.970
not Erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee

693
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:09.100
from prevention.

694
00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.330
I think we are too bold upon your rest.

695
00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:13.730
Good morrow, Brutus, do we trouble you?

696
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:16.500
I have been up this hour, awake all night.

697
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:22.130
Know I these men that come along with you?

698
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:26.230
Yes, every man of them, and no man here but honors you,

699
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.400
and every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself

700
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.700
which every noble Roman bears of you.

701
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.570
This is Trebonius.

702
00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:35.370
He is welcome hither.

703
00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:36.900
This, Decius Brutus.

704
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.970
He is welcome too.

705
00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:44.070
This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.

706
00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.770
They are all welcome.

707
00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:50.570
What watchful cares do interpose themselves

708
00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:53.700
betwixt your eyes and night?

709
00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.330
Shall I entreat a word?

710
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:09.870
Here lies the east.

711
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:11.670
Doth not the day break here?

712
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:13.530
No.

713
00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:14.970
O, pardon, sir, it doth,

714
00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:18.730
and yon grey lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day.

715
00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:21.870
You shall confess that you are both deceived.

716
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:25.000
Here, as I draw my sword, the sun arises,

717
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.230
which is a great way growing on the south,

718
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.000
weighing the youthful season of the year.

719
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.800
Some two months hence up higher toward the north

720
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.430
he first presents his fire,

721
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:37.730
and the high east stands as the Capitol, directly here.

722
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:40.300
Give me your hands all over, one by one.

723
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.130
And let us swear our resolution.

724
00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:44.600
No, not an oath.

725
00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.870
If not the face of men, the sufferance of our souls,

726
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:50.900
the time's abuse--

727
00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.100
if these be motives weak,break off betimes,

728
00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.700
and every man hence to his idle bed;

729
00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.900
so let high-sighted tyranny range on

730
00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.470
till each man drop by lottery.

731
00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:02.400
But if these, as I am sure they do,

732
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.470
bear fire enough to kindle cowards

733
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:07.500
and to steel with valor the melting spirits of women,

734
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.600
then, countrymen, what need we any spur but our own cause

735
00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.000
to prick us to redress?

736
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.370
What other bond than secret Romans that have spoke the word

737
00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:18.830
and will not palter?

738
00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:22.830
And what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged

739
00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:26.070
that this shall be or we will fall for it?

740
00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:30.730
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,

741
00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:32.430
old feeble carrions

742
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:35.570
and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs;

743
00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:39.000
unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt;

744
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.270
but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise,

745
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:44.270
nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,

746
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:47.430
to think that or our cause or our performance

747
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:48.770
did need an oath;

748
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:52.370
when every drop of blood that every Roman bears,

749
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:56.130
and nobly bears, is guilty of a several bastardy

750
00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:59.870
if he do break the smallest particle of any promise

751
00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:02.300
that hath pass'd from him.

752
00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.000
But what of Cicero?

753
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.330
Shall we sound him?

754
00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:35.370
I think he will stand very strong with us.

755
00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:37.230
Oh, let us not leave him out.

756
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:38.530
No, by no means.

757
00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:41.170
O, let us have him,

758
00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:44.300
for his silver hairs will purchase us a good opinion,

759
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.230
and buy men's voices to commend our deeds.

760
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:50.430
It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands;

761
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:53.200
our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,

762
00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.130
but all be buried in his gravity.

763
00:42:56.130 --> 00:43:00.570
O, name him not; let us not break with him,

764
00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:04.430
for he will never follow anything that other men begin.

765
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:05.970
Then leave him out.

766
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:15.030
Indeed he is not fit.

767
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:17.870
Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?

768
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:19.070
Decius, well urged.

769
00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:22.070
I think it is not meet Mark Antony,

770
00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:24.170
so well beloved of Caesar, should outlive Caesar.

771
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:27.470
We shall find of him a shrewd contriver;

772
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:28.970
and you know his means, if he improve them,

773
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:30.900
may well stretch so far as to annoy us all,

774
00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:34.370
which to prevent, let Antony and Caesar fall together.

775
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:36.770
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,

776
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:38.300
to cut the head off and then hack the limbs

777
00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:42.000
like wrath in death and envy afterwards;

778
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.570
for Antony is but a limb of Caesar.

779
00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:48.730
Let's be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.

780
00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:52.230
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,

781
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:56.670
and in the spirit of men there is no blood.

782
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:59.170
O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,

783
00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:01.100
and not dismember Caesar.

784
00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:06.300
But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it.

785
00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:16.000
And, gentle friends, let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;

786
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.970
let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,

787
00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:22.330
not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds;

788
00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:24.000
and let our hearts, as subtle masters do,

789
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.370
stir up their servants to an act of rage

790
00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:28.170
and after seem to chide 'em.

791
00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:31.330
This shall make our purpose necessary and not envious,

792
00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:33.670
which so appearing to the common eyes,

793
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:39.130
we shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.

794
00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:42.800
And for Mark Antony, think not of him,

795
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.000
for he can do no more

796
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.030
than Caesar's arm when Caesar's head is off.

797
00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:47.170
Yet I fear him,

798
00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:49.570
for in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar--

799
00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:51.030
Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.

800
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:54.170
If he love Caesar, all that he can do is to himself,

801
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:57.070
take thought and die for Caesar.

802
00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:58.730
And that were much he should,

803
00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:02.270
for he is given to sports, to wildness, and much company.

804
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:05.200
There is no fear in him-- let him not die,

805
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.900
for he will live and laugh at this hereafter.

806
00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:10.770
Peace, count the clock.

807
00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:17.500
The clock hath stricken three.

808
00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:18.600
'Tis time to part.

809
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.930
But it is doubtful yet

810
00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:21.530
whether Caesar will come forth today or no,

811
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:24.370
for he is superstitious grown of late,

812
00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:27.100
quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy,

813
00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:28.530
of dreams, and ceremonies.

814
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:31.070
It may be these apparent prodigies,

815
00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:32.370
the unaccustom'd terror of this night,

816
00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:34.500
and the persuasion of his augurers

817
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.030
may hold him from the Capitol today.

818
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:37.200
Never fear that.

819
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.570
If he be so resolved, I can o'ersway him,

820
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.470
for he loves to hear

821
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:44.000
that unicorns can be betray'd with trees,

822
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.500
and bears with glasses, elephants with holes,

823
00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:52.270
lions with toils, and men with flatterers;

824
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:54.670
but when I tell him he hates flatterers,

825
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:57.330
he says he does, being then most flattered.

826
00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:00.830
Let me work; for I can give his humor the true bent,

827
00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:03.400
and I will bring him to the Capitol.

828
00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.700
Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.

829
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.900
By the eighth hour.

830
00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:10.300
Is that the utter most?

831
00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:14.300
Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.

832
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.800
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,

833
00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.600
who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.

834
00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.570
I wonder none of you have thought of him.

835
00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:22.230
Now, good Metellus, go along by him.

836
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:24.770
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;

837
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:27.330
send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.

838
00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:28.800
The morning comes upon us.

839
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.470
We'll leave you, Brutus, and, friends, disperse yourselves,

840
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:33.300
but all remember what you have said

841
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.970
and show yourselves true Romans.

842
00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:38.430
Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;

843
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:41.770
let not our looks put on our purposes,

844
00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:43.800
but bear it as our Roman actors do,

845
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.670
with untired spirits and formal constancy.

846
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:49.200
And so, good morrow to you every one.

847
00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.400
Boy.

848
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.400
Lucius.

849
00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.730
Fast asleep?

850
00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:19.230
It is no matter.

851
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:25.070
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;

852
00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:27.630
thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,

853
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:32.670
which busy care draws in the brains of men;

854
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:36.800
therefore thou sleep'st so sound.

855
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:09.070
Brutus, my lord.

856
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:11.900
Portia, what mean you?

857
00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.370
Wherefore rise you now?

858
00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:17.970
It is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition

859
00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:19.300
to the raw cold morning.

860
00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:23.570
Nor for yours neither.

861
00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:26.930
You have ungently, Brutus, stole from my bed;

862
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:30.200
and yesternight at supper you suddenly arose

863
00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.070
and walk'd about, musing and sighing, with your arms across;

864
00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:36.100
and when I ask'd you what the matter was,

865
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.900
you stared upon me with ungentle looks.

866
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:44.430
I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,

867
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:47.370
and too impatiently stamp'd with your foot.

868
00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:50.030
Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,

869
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:52.000
but with an angry wafture of your hand

870
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
gave sign for me to leave you.

871
00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.230
So I did, fearing to strengthen that impatience

872
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:02.630
which seem'd too much enkindled,

873
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:07.770
and withal hoping it was but an effect of humor,

874
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:11.100
which sometime hath his hour with every man.

875
00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:15.900
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,

876
00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.970
and, could it work so much upon your shape

877
00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:22.800
as it hath much prevail'd on your condition,

878
00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.570
I should not know you, Brutus.

879
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:33.000
Dear my lord, make me acquainted with your cause of grief.

880
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.770
I am not well in health, and that is all.

881
00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:42.970
Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,

882
00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:44.870
he would embrace the means to come by it.

883
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:46.370
Why, so I do.

884
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:49.070
Good Portia, go to bed.

885
00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:55.030
Is Brutus sick, and is it physical to walk unbraced

886
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:58.170
and suck up the humors of the dank morning?

887
00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:59.500
What, is Brutus sick,

888
00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.500
and will he steal out of his wholesome bed

889
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.900
to dare the vile contagion of the night

890
00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.200
and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air

891
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:10.270
to add unto his sickness?

892
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:19.370
No, my Brutus, you have some sick offense within your mind,

893
00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:22.970
which by the right and virtue of my place I ought to know of;

894
00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:27.370
and, upon my knees, I charm you, by my once commended beauty,

895
00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:29.700
by all your vows of love

896
00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:33.370
and that great vow which did incorporate and make us one,

897
00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:38.130
that you unfold to me, yourself, your half,

898
00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:44.430
why you are heavy and what men tonight have had resort to you;

899
00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:47.030
for here have been some six or seven,

900
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:51.200
who did hide their faces even from darkness.

901
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.700
Kneel not, gentle Portia.

902
00:50:54.700 --> 00:51:00.300
I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.

903
00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:13.070
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,

904
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:17.130
is it excepted I should know no secrets that appertain to you?

905
00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:22.930
Am I yourself but, as it were, in sort or limitation,

906
00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.400
to keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,

907
00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.270
and talk to you sometimes?

908
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:31.700
Dwell I but in the suburbs of your good pleasure?

909
00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:37.270
If it be no more, Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.

910
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:41.370
You are my true and honorable wife, as dear to me

911
00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:44.200
as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart.

912
00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:50.000
If this were true, then should I know this secret.

913
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.930
I grant I am a woman,

914
00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:54.730
but withal a woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.

915
00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:55.970
I grant I am a woman,

916
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:58.830
but withal a woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.

917
00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:02.000
Think you I am no stronger than my sex,

918
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.970
being so father'd and so husbanded?

919
00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:07.270
Tell me your counsels.

920
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:09.600
I will not disclose 'em.

921
00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:14.830
I have made strong proof of my constancy,

922
00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:21.170
giving myself a voluntary wound here in the thigh.

923
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:26.630
Can I bear that with patience and not my husband's secrets?

924
00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:35.800
O ye gods, render me worthy of this noble wife!

925
00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.500
Hark, hark, one knocks.

926
00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:42.170
Portia, go in awhile,

927
00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:45.630
and by and by thy bosom shall partake the secrets of my heart.

928
00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:51.000
All my engagements I will construe to thee,

929
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.600
all the charactery of my sad brows.

930
00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.400
Leave me with haste.

931
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:07.300
Lucius, who's that knocks?

932
00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.230
Here is a sick man that would speak with you.

933
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:13.070
Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spoke of.

934
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:25.730
Boy, stand aside.

935
00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:28.930
Caius Ligarius, how?

936
00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:31.300
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.

937
00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:34.770
O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius, to wear a kerchief.

938
00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:36.000
Would you were not sick.

939
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.370
I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand

940
00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:40.800
any exploit worthy the name of honor.

941
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.770
Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,

942
00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:44.270
had you a healthful ear to hear of it.

943
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:46.900
By all the gods that Romans bow before,

944
00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:49.330
I here discard my sickness.

945
00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:51.970
Soul of Rome.

946
00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:55.070
Brave son, derived from honorable loins.

947
00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:58.330
Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up my mortified spirit.

948
00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:01.970
Now bid me run, and I will strive with things impossible,

949
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:04.130
yea, get the better of them.

950
00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:06.570
What's to do?

951
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:09.900
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.

952
00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:13.030
But are not some whole that we must make sick?

953
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:14.530
That must we also.

954
00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:17.500
What it is, my Caius, I shall unfold to thee,

955
00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.730
as we are going to whom it must be done.

956
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:23.530
Set on your foot, and with a heart new-fired I follow you,

957
00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:24.930
to do I know not what;

958
00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:29.200
but it sufficeth that Brutus leads me on.

959
00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.830
Follow me then.

960
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:38.270
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.

961
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:45.070
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,

962
00:54:45.070 --> 00:54:48.100
"Help, ho, They murther Caesar."

963
00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:49.370
Ho there.

964
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:50.530
My lord?

965
00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:52.570
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,

966
00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:54.900
and bring me their opinions of success.

967
00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.100
I will, my lord.

968
00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:57.970
What mean you, Caesar?

969
00:54:57.970 --> 00:54:59.470
Think you to walk forth?

970
00:54:59.470 --> 00:55:01.870
You shall not stir out of your house today.

971
00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:03.300
Caesar shall forth:

972
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.570
the things that threaten'd me ne'er look'd but on my back;

973
00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:08.800
when they shall see the face of Caesar, they are vanished.

974
00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:11.330
Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,

975
00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:12.700
yet now they fright me.

976
00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:15.230
There is one within,

977
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:17.200
besides the things that we have heard and seen,

978
00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:20.170
recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.

979
00:55:20.170 --> 00:55:23.400
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;

980
00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:26.630
and graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;

981
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:30.000
fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds,

982
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.130
in ranks and squadrons and right forms of war,

983
00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:34.770
which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;

984
00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:38.430
the noise of battle hurtled in the air,

985
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:41.600
horses did neigh and dying men did groan,

986
00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:45.300
and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.

987
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.570
O Caesar!

988
00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:50.400
These things are beyond all use, and I do fear them.

989
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:57.130
What can be avoided whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?

990
00:55:57.130 --> 00:55:59.870
Yet Caesar shall go forth,

991
00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:03.400
for these predictions are to the world in general as to Caesar.

992
00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.770
When beggars die, there are no comets seen;

993
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:10.600
the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.

994
00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.870
Cowards die many times before their deaths;

995
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:15.370
the valiant never taste of death but once.

996
00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:18.330
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,

997
00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:21.430
it seems to me most strange that men should fear

998
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:23.770
seeing that death, a necessary end,

999
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:25.400
will come when it will come.

1000
00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.430
What say the augurers?

1001
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:29.930
They would not have you to stir forth today.

1002
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:33.030
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,

1003
00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:35.670
they could not find a heart within the beast.

1004
00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:45.400
The gods do this in shame of cowardice.

1005
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:47.270
Caesar should be a beast without a heart

1006
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:49.130
if he should stay at home today for fear.

1007
00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:51.330
No, Caesar shall not.

1008
00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:52.770
Danger knows full well

1009
00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:54.930
Caesar is more dangerous than he.

1010
00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:57.800
We are two lions litter'd in one day,

1011
00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:59.400
and I the elder and more terrible.

1012
00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.030
And Caesar shall go forth.

1013
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:05.130
Alas, my lord, your wisdom is consumed in confidence.

1014
00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:07.400
Do not go forth today.

1015
00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:10.870
Call it my fear that keeps you in the house and not your own.

1016
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:14.030
We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House,

1017
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:16.500
and he shall say you are not well today.

1018
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:19.330
Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.

1019
00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:28.970
Mark Antony shall say I am not well,

1020
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:33.670
and, for thy humor, I will stay at home.

1021
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:35.970
Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.

1022
00:57:35.970 --> 00:57:37.270
Caesar, all hail!

1023
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:38.630
Good morrow, worthy Caesar!

1024
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:40.400
I come to fetch you to the Senate House.

1025
00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:41.570
And you are come in very happy time

1026
00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:43.500
to bear my greeting to the senators

1027
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:47.400
and tell them that I will not come today.

1028
00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:49.630
Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:

1029
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:51.030
I will not come today; tell them so, Decius.

1030
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:52.230
Say he is sick.

1031
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:53.730
Shall Caesar send a lie?

1032
00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:57.200
Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far

1033
00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.930
to be afeard to tell greybeards the truth?

1034
00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:02.600
Decius, tell them Caesar will not come.

1035
00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.500
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,

1036
00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:07.830
lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.

1037
00:58:07.830 --> 00:58:11.300
The cause is in my will: I will not come.

1038
00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:14.700
That is enough to satisfy the Senate.

1039
00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:16.900
But, for your private satisfaction,

1040
00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:20.400
because I love you, I will let you know.

1041
00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:23.470
Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home;

1042
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:26.600
she dreamt tonight she saw my statue,

1043
00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.270
which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,

1044
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:32.970
did run pure blood, and many lusty Romans

1045
00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:37.430
came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.

1046
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:40.430
And these does she apply for warnings and portents

1047
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:41.800
and evils imminent, and on her knee

1048
00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:43.800
hath begg'd that I will stay at home today.

1049
00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:46.070
This dream is all amiss interpreted;

1050
00:58:46.070 --> 00:58:48.300
it was a vision fair and fortunate.

1051
00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:51.570
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,

1052
00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:54.170
in which so many smiling Romans bathed,

1053
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:58.600
signifies that from you great Rome shall suck reviving blood,

1054
00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.970
and that great men shall press for tinctures, stains,

1055
00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:03.870
relics, and cognizance.

1056
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:08.030
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.

1057
00:59:16.830 --> 00:59:19.800
And this way have you well expounded it.

1058
00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.100
I have, when you have heard what I can say.

1059
00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:24.100
And know it now, the Senate have concluded

1060
00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:27.670
to give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.

1061
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:29.500
If you shall send them word you will not come,

1062
00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:30.900
their minds may change.

1063
00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:34.100
Besides, it were a mock apt to be render'd,

1064
00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:36.570
for someone to say "Break up the Senate till another time,

1065
00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:39.270
when Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams."

1066
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:41.800
If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper,

1067
00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:44.070
"Lo, Caesar is afraid"?

1068
00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:46.230
Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love to your proceeding

1069
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:50.870
bids me tell you this, and reason to my love is liable.

1070
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:54.630
How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia.

1071
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:56.430
I am ashamed I did yield to them.

1072
00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:58.300
Give me my robe, for I will go.

1073
00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:01.600
And look where Publius is come to fetch me.

1074
01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.800
Good morrow, Caesar.

1075
01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.730
Welcome, Publius.

1076
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:06.870
What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?

1077
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.770
Good morrow, Casca.

1078
01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:14.200
Caius Ligarius, Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy

1079
01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.900
as that same ague which hath made you lean.

1080
01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.530
What is't o'clock?

1081
01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:20.870
Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.

1082
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:24.200
I thank you for your pains and courtesy.

1083
01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:28.070
See, Antony, that revels long o' nights, is notwithstanding up.

1084
01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:29.270
Good morrow, Antony.

1085
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:30.900
So to most noble Caesar.

1086
01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.300
Bid them prepare within.

1087
01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:35.030
I am to blame to be thus waited for.

1088
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:39.670
Now, Cinna; now, Metellus; what, Trebonius,

1089
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:42.670
I have an hour's talk in store for you;

1090
01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:43.870
remember that you call on me today;

1091
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:47.000
be near me, that I may remember you.

1092
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.470
Caesar, I will.

1093
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:51.970
And so near will I be that your best friends

1094
01:00:51.970 --> 01:00:53.630
shall wish I had been further.

1095
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:55.530
Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me,

1096
01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:58.730
and we like friends will straightway go together.

1097
01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.530
That every like is not the same, O Caesar,

1098
01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:08.270
The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon.

1099
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.870
"Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;

1100
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:18.400
"come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna;

1101
01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.930
"trust not Trebonius; mark well Metellus Cimber;

1102
01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:24.470
"Decius Brutus loves thee not;

1103
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:26.930
"thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.

1104
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:29.600
"There is but one mind in all these men,

1105
01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.500
"and it is bent against Caesar.

1106
01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:35.170
"If thou beest not immortal, look about you.

1107
01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:37.570
"Security gives way to conspiracy.

1108
01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:39.570
"The mighty gods defend thee.

1109
01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:48.800
Thy lover, Artemidorus."

1110
01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.030
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,

1111
01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:53.030
and as a suitor will I give him this.

1112
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:56.270
My heart laments that virtue cannot live

1113
01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:57.700
out of the teeth of emulation.

1114
01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:01.300
If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayest live;

1115
01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:06.200
if not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.

1116
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:10.470
I prithee, boy, run to the Senate House;

1117
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:13.530
stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.

1118
01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:14.970
Why dost thou stay?

1119
01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:16.730
To know my errand, madam.

1120
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:20.070
I would have had thee there, and here again,

1121
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:24.630
ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.

1122
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:27.430
O constancy, be strong upon my side!

1123
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:31.030
Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!

1124
01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:35.000
I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.

1125
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.070
How hard it is for women to keep counsel.

1126
01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:41.030
Art thou here yet?

1127
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:42.370
Madam, what should I do?

1128
01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:44.730
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?

1129
01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:47.700
And so return to you, and nothing else?

1130
01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.630
Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,

1131
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:54.370
for he went sickly forth; and take good note

1132
01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:56.130
what Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.

1133
01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:59.070
Hark, boy, what noise is that?

1134
01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:00.970
I hear none.

1135
01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:02.130
Prithee, listen well.

1136
01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:07.270
I heard a bustling rumor like a fray,

1137
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:09.700
and the wind brings it from the Capitol.

1138
01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.270
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.

1139
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:22.500
Come hither, fellow; which way hast thou been?

1140
01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.030
At mine own house, good lady.

1141
01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:25.330
What is't o'clock?

1142
01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:26.730
About the ninth hour, lady.

1143
01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:28.770
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?

1144
01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:30.070
Madam, not yet.

1145
01:03:30.070 --> 01:03:32.130
I go to take my stand to see him pass on to the Capitol.

1146
01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:33.770
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?

1147
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:35.970
That I have, lady.

1148
01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:39.870
If it will please Caesar to be so good to Caesar as to hear me,

1149
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:42.330
I shall beseech him to befriend himself.

1150
01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:45.370
Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?

1151
01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:51.930
None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.

1152
01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:54.200
Good morrow to you.

1153
01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.600
Here the street is narrow,

1154
01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.600
the throng that follows Caesar on the heels of senators,

1155
01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.400
of praetors, common suitors,

1156
01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.000
will crowd a feeble man almost to death.

1157
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.900
I'll get me to a place more void

1158
01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:07.530
and there speak to great Caesar as he comes along.

1159
01:04:10.030 --> 01:04:14.700
Ay me, how weak a thing the heart of woman is!

1160
01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:19.470
O Brutus, the heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!

1161
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:22.430
Sure, the boy heard me.

1162
01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:40.670
Brutus hath a suit that Caesar will not grant.

1163
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:42.830
O, I grow faint.

1164
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:53.330
Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord; say I am merry.

1165
01:04:53.330 --> 01:05:01.670
Come to me again, and bring me word what he doth say to thee.

1166
01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:14.270
The ides of March are come.

1167
01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:17.600
Ay, Caesar, but not gone.

1168
01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.330
Hail, Caesar!

1169
01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:20.730
Read this schedule.

1170
01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:22.900
Trebonius doth desire you to o'er read, at your best leisure,

1171
01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:24.270
this his most humble suit.

1172
01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:25.500
O Caesar, read mine first,

1173
01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.030
for mine's a suit that touches Caesar nearer.

1174
01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:28.230
Read it, great Caesar.

1175
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:30.930
What touches us ourself shall be last served.

1176
01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:32.900
Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.

1177
01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:34.070
What, is the fellow mad?

1178
01:05:34.070 --> 01:05:35.870
Sirrah, give place!

1179
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:48.900
What, urge you your petitions in the street?

1180
01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:51.330
Come to the Capitol.

1181
01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:23.830
I wish your enterprise today may thrive.

1182
01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:25.630
What enterprise, Popilius?

1183
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:27.470
Fare you well.

1184
01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:31.030
What said Popilius Lena?

1185
01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:33.370
He wish'd today our enterprise might thrive.

1186
01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:35.100
I fear our purpose is discovered.

1187
01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:42.900
Look how he makes to Caesar; mark him.

1188
01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:45.600
Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.

1189
01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.300
Brutus, what shall be done?

1190
01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:50.100
If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,

1191
01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:51.330
for I will slay myself.

1192
01:06:51.330 --> 01:06:53.100
Cassius, be constant.

1193
01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:16.270
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;

1194
01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:18.900
for, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.

1195
01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:22.770
Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus,

1196
01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:26.470
he draws Mark Antony out of the way.

1197
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:27.800
Where is Metellus Cimber?

1198
01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.130
Let him go and presently prefer his suit to Caesar.

1199
01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:32.830
He is address'd; press near and second him.

1200
01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:38.670
Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.

1201
01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:42.400
What is now amiss that Caesar and his Senate must redress?

1202
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:45.770
Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,

1203
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:49.230
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat an humble heart.

1204
01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:50.700
I must prevent thee, Cimber.

1205
01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:53.100
These couchings and these lowly courtesies

1206
01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:54.770
might fire the blood of ordinary men

1207
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:58.630
and turn preordinance and first decree into the law of children.

1208
01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:02.970
Be not fond to think that Caesar bears such rebel blood

1209
01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:04.670
that will be thaw'd from the true quality

1210
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:06.300
with that which melteth fools.

1211
01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:09.400
I mean sweet words, low-crooked court'sies,

1212
01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.530
and base spaniel-fawning.

1213
01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:13.930
Thy brother by decree is banished.

1214
01:08:13.930 --> 01:08:17.230
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,

1215
01:08:17.230 --> 01:08:20.670
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.

1216
01:08:20.670 --> 01:08:22.130
Know, Caesar doth not wrong,

1217
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:24.430
nor without cause will he be satisfied.

1218
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:26.400
Is there no voice more worthy than my own,

1219
01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.870
to sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear

1220
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:30.830
for the repealing of my banish'd brother?

1221
01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:33.300
I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,

1222
01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:34.900
desiring thee that Publius Cimber

1223
01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:36.270
may have an immediate freedom of repeal.

1224
01:08:36.270 --> 01:08:37.470
What, Brutus?

1225
01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:38.670
Pardon, Caesar!

1226
01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:39.800
Caesar, pardon!

1227
01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.830
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall

1228
01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:44.100
to beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.

1229
01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:47.600
I could be well moved, if I were as you;

1230
01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:51.400
if I could pray to move, then prayers would move me;

1231
01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:54.770
but I am constant as the northern star,

1232
01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:57.770
of whose true-fix'd and resting quality

1233
01:08:57.770 --> 01:08:59.770
there is no fellow in the firmament.

1234
01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:03.270
The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks;

1235
01:09:03.270 --> 01:09:06.500
they are all fire and every one doth shine;

1236
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:09.230
but there's but one in all doth hold his place.

1237
01:09:09.230 --> 01:09:13.230
So in the world, 'tis furnish'd well with men,

1238
01:09:13.230 --> 01:09:16.370
and men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;

1239
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:19.370
yet in the number I do know but one

1240
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:22.570
that unassailable holds on his rank, unshaked of motion;

1241
01:09:22.570 --> 01:09:26.400
and that I am he, let me a little show it, even in this;

1242
01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:29.170
that I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,

1243
01:09:29.170 --> 01:09:31.330
and constant do remain to keep him so.

1244
01:09:31.330 --> 01:09:32.500
O Caesar--

1245
01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.400
Hence! Wilt thou lift up Olympus?

1246
01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:35.570
Great Caesar--

1247
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:38.000
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?

1248
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.070
Speak, hands, for me!

1249
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:19.900
Et tu, Brute?

1250
01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:23.870
Then fall, Caesar.

1251
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:51.030
Liberty!

1252
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:52.230
Freedom!

1253
01:10:52.230 --> 01:10:53.770
Tyranny is dead!

1254
01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:56.770
Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets!

1255
01:10:56.770 --> 01:10:58.070
Some to the common pulpits,

1256
01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:00.700
cry out, "Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!"

1257
01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:02.400
People and senators, be not affrighted,

1258
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.730
fly not, stand still; ambition's debt is paid.

1259
01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:07.070
Go to the pulpit, Brutus.

1260
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:08.300
And Cassius too.

1261
01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:09.430
Where's Publius?

1262
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:11.700
Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.

1263
01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.470
Stand fast together, lest some friend--

1264
01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:14.900
Talk not of standing.

1265
01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:18.270
Publius, good cheer, there is no harm intended to your person,

1266
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:19.500
nor to no Roman else.

1267
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.830
So tell them, Publius.

1268
01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:23.300
And leave us, Publius, lest the people rushing on us

1269
01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:24.700
should do your age some mischief.

1270
01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:28.130
Do so, and let no man abide this deed but we the doers.

1271
01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:35.730
Where is Antony?

1272
01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:37.570
Fled to his house amazed.

1273
01:11:37.570 --> 01:11:39.300
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run

1274
01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:40.470
as it were doomsday.

1275
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:42.100
Fates, we will know your pleasures.

1276
01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:44.730
That we shall die, we know;

1277
01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:48.600
'tis but the time and drawing days out that men stand upon.

1278
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.630
Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life

1279
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:52.300
cuts off so many years of fearing death.

1280
01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.330
Grant that, and then is death a benefit;

1281
01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:56.670
so are we Caesar's friends

1282
01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:59.700
that have abridged his time of fearing death.

1283
01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:13.870
Stoop, Romans, stoop,

1284
01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:17.030
and let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood

1285
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:21.330
up to the elbows, and besmear our swords.

1286
01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:42.830
Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace,

1287
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:45.530
and waving our red weapons o'er our heads,

1288
01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:54.030
Let's all cry, "Peace, freedom, and liberty!"

1289
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:57.000
Stoop then, and wash.

1290
01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:09.170
How many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over

1291
01:13:09.170 --> 01:13:12.070
in states unborn and accents yet unknown!

1292
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:14.300
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,

1293
01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:18.070
that now on Pompey's basis lies along no worthier than the dust.

1294
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:20.070
So oft as that shall be,

1295
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:22.370
so often shall the knot of us be call'd

1296
01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:25.470
the men that gave their country liberty.

1297
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:35.000
What, shall we forth?

1298
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.670
Ay, every man away.

1299
01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:40.700
Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels

1300
01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:44.430
with the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.

1301
01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:54.600
Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel,

1302
01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.800
thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,

1303
01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.600
and, being prostrate,thus he bade me say:

1304
01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:05.600
Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;

1305
01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:11.570
Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.

1306
01:14:11.570 --> 01:14:14.930
Say I love Brutus and I honor him;

1307
01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:20.270
say I fear'd Caesar, honor'd him, and loved him.

1308
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:22.070
If Brutus will vouchsafe

1309
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:24.330
that Antony may safely come to him

1310
01:14:24.330 --> 01:14:28.030
and be resolved how Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,

1311
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:30.630
Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead

1312
01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:32.730
so well as Brutus living,

1313
01:14:32.730 --> 01:14:35.630
but will follow the fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus

1314
01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:38.670
thorough the hazards of this untrod state

1315
01:14:38.670 --> 01:14:41.400
with all true faith.

1316
01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.800
So says my master Antony.

1317
01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.230
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;

1318
01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:49.030
I never thought him worse.

1319
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:52.300
Tell him, so please him come unto this place,

1320
01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:56.300
he shall be satisfied and, by my honor, depart untouch'd.

1321
01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:01.000
I'll fetch him presently.

1322
01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:08.830
I know that we shall have him well to friend.

1323
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:13.100
I wish we may, but yet have I a mind that fears him much,

1324
01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:16.200
and my misgiving still falls shrewdly to the purpose.

1325
01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.300
Welcome, Mark Antony.

1326
01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.970
O mighty Caesar.

1327
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:10.830
Dost thou lie so low?

1328
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:14.430
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,

1329
01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:16.870
shrunk to this little measure?

1330
01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:21.500
Fare thee well.

1331
01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:34.530
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,

1332
01:16:34.530 --> 01:16:38.670
who else must be let blood, who else is rank.

1333
01:16:38.670 --> 01:16:43.030
If I myself, there is no hour so fit as Caesar's death's hour,

1334
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:47.100
nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords,

1335
01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:51.000
made rich with the most noble blood of all this world.

1336
01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:59.570
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,

1337
01:16:59.570 --> 01:17:03.570
now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,

1338
01:17:03.570 --> 01:17:06.670
fulfill your pleasure.

1339
01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:10.970
Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die;

1340
01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:14.630
no place will please me so, no means of death,

1341
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:18.200
as here by Caesar, and by you cut off,

1342
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:24.430
the choice and master spirits of this age.

1343
01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:29.030
O Antony, beg not your death of us.

1344
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:32.170
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,

1345
01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:35.600
as, by our hands and this our present act you see we do,

1346
01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:38.130
yet see you but our hands

1347
01:17:38.130 --> 01:17:41.130
and this the bleeding business they have done.

1348
01:17:41.130 --> 01:17:45.500
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;

1349
01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:48.400
and pity to the general wrong of Rome--

1350
01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.830
as fire drives out fire, so pity pity--

1351
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:54.430
Hath done this deed on Caesar.

1352
01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:58.970
For your part, to you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;

1353
01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:01.030
our arms in strength of malice,

1354
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:03.300
and our hearts of brothers' temper,

1355
01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:05.970
do receive you in with all kind love,

1356
01:18:05.970 --> 01:18:08.470
good thoughts, and reverence.

1357
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:10.600
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's

1358
01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.970
in the disposing of new dignities.

1359
01:18:12.970 --> 01:18:15.330
Only be patient till we have appeased the multitude,

1360
01:18:15.330 --> 01:18:17.000
beside themselves with fear,

1361
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.500
and then we will deliver you the cause why I,

1362
01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.830
that did love Caesar when I struck him,

1363
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:25.370
have thus proceeded.

1364
01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:27.870
I doubt not of your wisdom.

1365
01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:36.400
Let each man render me his bloody hand.

1366
01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:40.200
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;

1367
01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:49.730
next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;

1368
01:18:49.730 --> 01:18:52.670
now, Decius Brutus, yours;

1369
01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:58.000
yours, good Metellus; yours, Cinna;

1370
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.300
and, my valiant Casca, yours;

1371
01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:08.330
though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.

1372
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:18.700
Gentlemen all.

1373
01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:20.570
Alas, what shall I say?

1374
01:19:20.570 --> 01:19:24.000
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,

1375
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.830
that one of two bad ways you must conceit me,

1376
01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:31.530
either a coward or a flatterer.

1377
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:39.700
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true.

1378
01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:42.830
If then thy spirit look upon us now,

1379
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:45.030
shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death

1380
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:48.530
to see thy Antony making his peace,

1381
01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:52.330
shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes, most noble,

1382
01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:54.400
in the presence of thy course?

1383
01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.030
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,

1384
01:19:58.030 --> 01:20:01.230
weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,

1385
01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:02.630
it would become me better

1386
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:07.400
than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies.

1387
01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:11.400
Pardon me, Julius.

1388
01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:14.430
Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart,

1389
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:19.730
here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand,

1390
01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:31.230
sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy Lethe.

1391
01:20:31.230 --> 01:20:34.670
and this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.

1392
01:20:34.670 --> 01:20:42.430
How like a deer strucken by many princes dost thou here lie.

1393
01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:43.570
Mark Antony--

1394
01:20:43.570 --> 01:20:46.000
Pardon me, Caius Cassius.

1395
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.230
The enemies of Caesar shall say this:

1396
01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:51.270
then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.

1397
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:53.570
I blame you not for praising Caesar so;

1398
01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:56.630
but what compact mean you to have with us?

1399
01:20:56.630 --> 01:20:58.730
Will you be prick'd in number of our friends,

1400
01:20:58.730 --> 01:21:01.030
or shall we on, and not depend on you?

1401
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:03.900
Therefore I took your hand,

1402
01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:09.070
but was indeed sway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar.

1403
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:15.270
Friends am I with you all and love you all,

1404
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:18.800
upon this hope that you shall give me reasons

1405
01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.130
why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.

1406
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:24.730
Or else were this a savage spectacle.

1407
01:21:24.730 --> 01:21:28.830
Our reasons are so full of good regard that were you, Antony,

1408
01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:32.730
the son of Caesar, you should be satisfied.

1409
01:21:32.730 --> 01:21:36.970
That's all I seek; and am moreover suitor

1410
01:21:36.970 --> 01:21:40.230
that I may produce his body to the marketplace,

1411
01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:43.470
and in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,

1412
01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:49.030
speak in the order of his funeral.

1413
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:52.330
You shall, Mark Antony.

1414
01:21:52.330 --> 01:21:55.470
Brutus, a word with you.

1415
01:22:00.170 --> 01:22:02.470
You know not what you do.

1416
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:04.300
Do not consent that Antony speak in his funeral.

1417
01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:06.030
Know you how much the people may be moved

1418
01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:07.370
by that he will utter?

1419
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:10.270
By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first,

1420
01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:12.030
and show the reason of our Caesar's death.

1421
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:13.400
What Antony shall speak,

1422
01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.600
I will protest he speaks by leave and by permission,

1423
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.900
and that we are contented Caesar shall have

1424
01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:20.030
all true rites and lawful ceremonies.

1425
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:22.730
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.

1426
01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:27.170
I know not what may fall; I like it not.

1427
01:22:32.770 --> 01:22:35.830
Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.

1428
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:38.500
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,

1429
01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.700
but speak all good you can devise of Caesar,

1430
01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:42.630
and say you do't by our permission,

1431
01:22:42.630 --> 01:22:45.770
else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral.

1432
01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:48.930
and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto I am going,

1433
01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:51.000
after my speech is ended.

1434
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.400
Be it so, I do desire no more.

1435
01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:58.630
Prepare the body then, and follow us.

1436
01:23:14.170 --> 01:23:17.400
O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,

1437
01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:23.730
that I am meek and gentle with these butchers!

1438
01:23:23.730 --> 01:23:26.630
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man

1439
01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:30.830
that ever lived in the tide of times.

1440
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:34.570
Woe to the hand that shed his costly blood.

1441
01:23:34.570 --> 01:23:38.500
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,

1442
01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:40.970
which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips

1443
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:44.770
to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue.

1444
01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:47.230
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;

1445
01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:51.000
domestic fury and fierce civil strife

1446
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.600
shall cumber all the parts of Italy;

1447
01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.330
blood and destruction shall be so in use,

1448
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:58.500
and dreadful objects so familiar,

1449
01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.570
that mothers shall but smile

1450
01:24:00.570 --> 01:24:04.170
when they behold their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;

1451
01:24:04.170 --> 01:24:07.230
all pity choked with custom of fell deeds,

1452
01:24:07.230 --> 01:24:10.900
and Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,

1453
01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:14.170
with Ate by his side come hot from hell,

1454
01:24:14.170 --> 01:24:20.570
shall in these confines with a monarch's voice cry "havoc!"

1455
01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:23.700
And let slip the dogs of war,

1456
01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:27.630
that this foul deed shall smell above the earth

1457
01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:32.270
with carrion men, groaning for burial.

1458
01:24:40.770 --> 01:24:43.930
You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?

1459
01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:46.670
I do, Mark Antony.

1460
01:24:46.670 --> 01:24:49.070
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.

1461
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:51.030
He did receive his letters, and is coming,

1462
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:54.500
and bid me say to you by word of mouth--

1463
01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:56.030
O Caesar!

1464
01:24:58.430 --> 01:25:02.430
Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.

1465
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:07.630
Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,

1466
01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:11.670
seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, began to water.

1467
01:25:15.670 --> 01:25:17.230
Is thy master coming?

1468
01:25:17.230 --> 01:25:20.570
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.

1469
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:23.070
Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.

1470
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:28.430
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,

1471
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:32.270
no Rome of safety for Octavius yet;

1472
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:34.530
hie hence, and tell him so.

1473
01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:41.300
Yet stay awhile, thou shalt not back

1474
01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:45.330
till I have borne this corpse into the marketplace.

1475
01:25:45.330 --> 01:25:47.530
There shall I try, in my oration,

1476
01:25:47.530 --> 01:25:53.100
how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men,

1477
01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:56.370
according to the which thou shalt discourse

1478
01:25:56.370 --> 01:25:59.470
to young Octavius of the state of things.

1479
01:26:20.230 --> 01:26:24.570
Then follow me and give me audience, friends!

1480
01:26:24.570 --> 01:26:27.870
Cassius, go you into the other street and part the numbers.

1481
01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:30.670
Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;

1482
01:26:30.670 --> 01:26:34.130
those that will follow Cassius, go with him;

1483
01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:37.630
and public reasons shall be rendered Of Caesar's death.

1484
01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:51.670
Be patient till the last!

1485
01:26:51.670 --> 01:26:57.500
Romans, countrymen, and lovers.

1486
01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:05.000
Hear me for my cause, and be silent, that you may hear.

1487
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.930
Believe me for mine honor,

1488
01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:12.200
and have respect to mine honor, that you may believe.

1489
01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:16.800
Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses,

1490
01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:20.030
that you may the better judge.

1491
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:23.470
If there be any in this assembly,

1492
01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:27.470
any dear friend of Caesar's, to him I say

1493
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:33.300
that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his.

1494
01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:38.530
If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar,

1495
01:27:38.530 --> 01:27:44.830
this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less,

1496
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:48.130
but that I loved Rome more.

1497
01:27:51.630 --> 01:27:56.400
Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves,

1498
01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:01.870
than that Caesar were dead to live all freemen?

1499
01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.000
As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;

1500
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.100
as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it;

1501
01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:12.170
as he was valiant, I honor him;

1502
01:28:12.170 --> 01:28:19.830
but as he was ambitious, I slew him!

1503
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.330
There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune,

1504
01:28:27.330 --> 01:28:31.900
honor for his valor, and death for his ambition.

1505
01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:39.730
Who is here so base that would be a bondman?

1506
01:28:39.730 --> 01:28:43.930
If any, speak, for him have I offended.

1507
01:28:43.930 --> 01:28:49.130
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman?

1508
01:28:49.130 --> 01:28:54.770
If any, speak, for him have I offended.

1509
01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:59.970
Who is here so vile that will not love his country?

1510
01:28:59.970 --> 01:29:06.300
If any, speak, for him have I offended.

1511
01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:10.000
I pause for a reply.

1512
01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:15.230
None, Brutus, none.

1513
01:29:15.230 --> 01:29:17.070
Then none have I offended.

1514
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:22.970
I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus.

1515
01:29:22.970 --> 01:29:25.370
The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol,

1516
01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:28.530
his glory not extenuated, wherein he was worthy,

1517
01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:33.500
nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered death.

1518
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:40.330
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony,

1519
01:29:40.330 --> 01:29:44.600
who, though he had no hand in his death,

1520
01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:48.100
shall receive the benefit of his dying,

1521
01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:54.970
a place in the commonwealth, as which of you shall not?

1522
01:30:04.230 --> 01:30:07.170
With this I depart--

1523
01:30:07.170 --> 01:30:13.230
that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome,

1524
01:30:13.230 --> 01:30:17.500
I have the same dagger for myself,

1525
01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:21.870
when it shall please my country to need my death.

1526
01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:24.670
Live!

1527
01:30:33.230 --> 01:30:36.300
Good countrymen, let me depart alone,

1528
01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:39.070
and, for my sake, stay here with Antony.

1529
01:30:39.070 --> 01:30:42.770
Do grace to Caesar's corpse,

1530
01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:47.800
and grace his speech tending to Caesar's glories,

1531
01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:53.730
which Mark Antony, by our permission, is allow'd to make.

1532
01:30:53.730 --> 01:30:59.730
I do entreat you, not a man depart, save I alone,

1533
01:30:59.730 --> 01:31:02.030
till Antony have spoke.

1534
01:31:09.170 --> 01:31:12.470
Let him go in the public chair; we will hear him.

1535
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:14.900
Noble Antony, go up.

1536
01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:17.700
For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.

1537
01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:18.900
What does he say of Brutus?

1538
01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:20.600
He says, for Brutus' sake,

1539
01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:21.730
he' beholding to us all.

1540
01:31:21.730 --> 01:31:25.000
'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.

1541
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.800
This Caesar was a tyrant!

1542
01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:29.170
Nay, that's certain.

1543
01:31:29.170 --> 01:31:31.230
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.

1544
01:31:31.230 --> 01:31:33.600
Peace! Let us hear what Antony can say.

1545
01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:39.430
You gentle Romans--

1546
01:31:43.970 --> 01:31:46.030
Peace, ho!

1547
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:58.230
Friends, Romans, countrymen...

1548
01:31:58.230 --> 01:32:02.830
lend me your ears!

1549
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:06.830
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.

1550
01:32:09.630 --> 01:32:11.600
The evil that men do lives after them,

1551
01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:15.270
the good is oft interred with their bones;

1552
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:17.500
so let it be with Caesar.

1553
01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:24.130
The noble Brutus hath told you Caesar was ambitious;

1554
01:32:24.130 --> 01:32:27.930
if it were so, it was a grievous fault,

1555
01:32:27.930 --> 01:32:31.000
and grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.

1556
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.600
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--

1557
01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:39.970
for Brutus is an honorable man; so are they all,

1558
01:32:39.970 --> 01:32:43.670
all honorable men.

1559
01:32:43.670 --> 01:32:49.000
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.

1560
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:54.100
He was my friend, faithful and just to me;

1561
01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:58.800
but Brutus says he was ambitious,

1562
01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:02.600
and Brutus is an honorable man!

1563
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:09.570
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,

1564
01:33:09.570 --> 01:33:13.630
whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.

1565
01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:18.700
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?

1566
01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:23.700
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;

1567
01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:26.800
ambition should be made of sterner stuff:

1568
01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:30.270
yet Brutus says he was ambitious,

1569
01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:34.330
and Brutus is an honorable man.

1570
01:33:34.330 --> 01:33:36.200
You all did see

1571
01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:40.600
that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown,

1572
01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:42.870
which he did thrice refuse.

1573
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:45.130
Was this ambition?

1574
01:33:45.130 --> 01:33:48.030
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,

1575
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:50.300
and sure he is an honorable man.

1576
01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:52.300
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,

1577
01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:56.530
but here I am to speak what I do know.

1578
01:33:56.530 --> 01:34:03.330
You all did love him once, not without cause;

1579
01:34:06.230 --> 01:34:10.330
what cause withholds you then to mourn for him?

1580
01:34:10.330 --> 01:34:12.770
O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

1581
01:34:12.770 --> 01:34:14.570
and men have lost their reason.

1582
01:34:18.670 --> 01:34:22.700
Bear with me; my heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,

1583
01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:26.000
and I must pause till it come back to me.

1584
01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:32.470
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.

1585
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:33.570
If thou consider rightly of the matter,

1586
01:34:33.570 --> 01:34:35.700
Caesar has had great wrong.

1587
01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:37.200
Has he, masters?

1588
01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:40.730
I fear there will a worse come in his place.

1589
01:34:40.730 --> 01:34:42.300
He would not take the crown;

1590
01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:44.830
therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.

1591
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:51.570
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.

1592
01:34:51.570 --> 01:34:55.430
Ah, poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.

1593
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:57.770
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.

1594
01:34:57.770 --> 01:34:59.330
Now mark him, he begins again to speak.

1595
01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:09.500
But yesterday the word of Caesar

1596
01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:12.270
might have stood against the world.

1597
01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:22.100
Now lies he there, and none so poor to do him reverence.

1598
01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:24.300
O masters!

1599
01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:25.800
If I were disposed

1600
01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:28.000
to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,

1601
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.700
I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,

1602
01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:33.570
who, you all know, are honorable men.

1603
01:35:33.570 --> 01:35:37.270
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose to wrong the dead,

1604
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:42.070
to wrong myself and you, than I will wrong such honorable men.

1605
01:35:45.230 --> 01:35:49.470
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;

1606
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:56.270
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will.

1607
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:58.830
Let but the commons hear this testament--

1608
01:35:58.830 --> 01:36:01.270
which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--

1609
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:06.130
and they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds

1610
01:36:06.130 --> 01:36:08.500
and dip their napkins in his sacred blood,

1611
01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:11.230
yea, beg a hair of him for memory, and, dying,

1612
01:36:11.230 --> 01:36:12.970
mention it within their wills,

1613
01:36:12.970 --> 01:36:15.200
bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue.

1614
01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:22.800
Will you be patient?

1615
01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:26.400
Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;

1616
01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:34.000
it is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.

1617
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.530
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;

1618
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:38.730
and, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,

1619
01:36:38.730 --> 01:36:42.100
it will inflame you, it will make you mad.

1620
01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:46.870
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,

1621
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:51.130
for if you should, O, what would come of it!

1622
01:36:56.430 --> 01:36:57.770
Will you be patient?

1623
01:36:57.770 --> 01:36:59.730
Will you stay awhile?

1624
01:36:59.730 --> 01:37:02.600
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.

1625
01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:03.870
I fear I wrong the honorable men

1626
01:37:03.870 --> 01:37:07.630
whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.

1627
01:37:07.630 --> 01:37:10.230
They were traitors! Honorable men?

1628
01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.630
The will! The will!

1629
01:37:21.630 --> 01:37:23.300
The will! The will!

1630
01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:25.070
The will! The will!

1631
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:26.700
The will! The will!

1632
01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:28.500
The will! The will!

1633
01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:30.270
The will! The will!

1634
01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:31.270
The will!

1635
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:37.830
You will compel me then to read the will?

1636
01:37:40.930 --> 01:37:43.630
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,

1637
01:37:43.630 --> 01:37:47.970
that I may show you him that made the will.

1638
01:37:47.970 --> 01:37:50.630
Shall I descend, and will you give me leave?

1639
01:38:10.670 --> 01:38:17.570
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.

1640
01:38:17.570 --> 01:38:19.630
You all do know this mantle.

1641
01:38:19.630 --> 01:38:23.330
I remember the first time ever Caesar put it on;

1642
01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:26.070
'twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,

1643
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:30.000
that day he overcame the Nervii.

1644
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.630
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through;

1645
01:38:36.630 --> 01:38:41.070
see what a rent the envious Casca made;

1646
01:38:41.070 --> 01:38:46.700
through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;

1647
01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:50.770
and as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,

1648
01:38:50.770 --> 01:38:54.000
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,

1649
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.330
as rushing out of doors,

1650
01:38:55.330 --> 01:38:59.000
to be resolved if Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;

1651
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.830
for Brutus, you all know, was Caesar's angel.

1652
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:08.030
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him.

1653
01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:13.570
This was the most unkindest cut of all;

1654
01:39:13.570 --> 01:39:20.170
for when the noble Caesar saw him stab, ingratitude,

1655
01:39:20.170 --> 01:39:26.630
more strong than traitors' arms, quite vanquish'd him.

1656
01:39:26.630 --> 01:39:28.670
Then burst his mighty heart,

1657
01:39:28.670 --> 01:39:30.600
and, in his mantle muffling up his face,

1658
01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:32.830
even at the base of Pompey's statue,

1659
01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:39.230
which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell!

1660
01:39:43.630 --> 01:39:47.370
What a fall was there, my countrymen.

1661
01:39:47.370 --> 01:39:53.270
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,

1662
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:58.070
whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.

1663
01:39:58.070 --> 01:40:05.600
O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel the dint of pity.

1664
01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:10.770
These are gracious drops.

1665
01:40:10.770 --> 01:40:13.100
Kind souls, what weep you when you but behold

1666
01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:15.270
our Caesar's vesture wounded?

1667
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:18.070
Look you here, here is himself,

1668
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:21.770
marr'd, as you see, with traitors!

1669
01:40:21.770 --> 01:40:22.900
Oh!

1670
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:26.870
- O piteous spectacle. - O noble Caesar.

1671
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:28.070
Woeful day.

1672
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:29.530
Villains. Traitors.

1673
01:40:29.530 --> 01:40:32.900
O most bloody sight!

1674
01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:34.870
We will be revenged!

1675
01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:45.900
Good friends, sweet friends,

1676
01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:49.830
let me not stir you up to such a sudden flood of mutiny.

1677
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:53.130
They that have done this deed are honorable.

1678
01:40:53.130 --> 01:40:54.770
What private griefs they have,

1679
01:40:54.770 --> 01:40:56.100
alas, I know not, that made them do it,

1680
01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:57.700
but they are wise and honorable,

1681
01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:00.300
and will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.

1682
01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:03.830
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.

1683
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:07.130
I am no orator, as Brutus is; but, as you know me all,

1684
01:41:07.130 --> 01:41:11.130
a plain blunt man, that loved my friend,

1685
01:41:11.130 --> 01:41:14.370
and that they know full well that gave me public leave

1686
01:41:14.370 --> 01:41:15.970
to speak of him.

1687
01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:18.270
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, action,

1688
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:22.070
nor utterance, nor the power of speech, to stir men's blood.

1689
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:24.430
I only speak right on;

1690
01:41:24.430 --> 01:41:27.130
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;

1691
01:41:27.130 --> 01:41:35.600
show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor, poor dumb mouths,

1692
01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:38.330
and bid them speak for me!

1693
01:41:38.330 --> 01:41:42.270
But were I Brutus, and Brutus Antony,

1694
01:41:42.270 --> 01:41:44.900
there were an Antony would ruffle up your spirits

1695
01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:47.130
and put a tongue in every wound of Caesar's

1696
01:41:47.130 --> 01:41:52.800
that should move the stones of Rome to rise and mutiny!

1697
01:42:05.230 --> 01:42:11.000
Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.

1698
01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.500
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?

1699
01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:19.530
Alas, you know not; I must tell you then.

1700
01:42:19.530 --> 01:42:26.530
You have forgot the will I told you of.

1701
01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:43.630
Here is the will, and under seal of Caesar.

1702
01:42:46.370 --> 01:42:53.270
To every Roman citizen...

1703
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:57.500
he gives seventy-five drachmas.

1704
01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:00.930
Hear me with patience.

1705
01:43:00.930 --> 01:43:04.970
Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, his private arbors,

1706
01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:07.930
and new-planted orchards, on this side Tiber;

1707
01:43:07.930 --> 01:43:12.000
he hath left them you, and to your heirs forever--

1708
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:17.070
common pleasures, to walk abroad and recreate yourselves.

1709
01:43:17.070 --> 01:43:20.900
Here was a Caesar!

1710
01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:24.100
When comes such another?

1711
01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:26.830
Never! Never!

1712
01:43:40.830 --> 01:43:43.100
Now let it work.

1713
01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:49.830
Mischief, thou art afoot, take thou what course thou wilt.

1714
01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:51.300
How now, fellow?

1715
01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:53.570
Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.

1716
01:43:53.570 --> 01:43:54.670
Where is he?

1717
01:43:54.670 --> 01:43:56.030
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.

1718
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:58.530
And thither will I straight to visit him.

1719
01:43:58.530 --> 01:43:59.970
He comes upon a wish.

1720
01:43:59.970 --> 01:44:03.570
Fortune is merry, and in this mood will give us anything.

1721
01:44:03.570 --> 01:44:05.030
I heard him say Brutus and Cassius

1722
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:06.900
are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.

1723
01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:08.500
Be like they had some notice of the people,

1724
01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:09.830
how I had moved them.

1725
01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:15.030
Come, bring me to Octavius.

1726
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:23.970
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,

1727
01:44:23.970 --> 01:44:27.530
and things unluckily charge my fantasy.

1728
01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:30.430
I have no will to wander forth of doors,

1729
01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:31.730
yet something leads me forth.

1730
01:44:31.730 --> 01:44:32.930
What is your name?

1731
01:44:32.930 --> 01:44:34.130
Whither are you going?

1732
01:44:34.130 --> 01:44:35.370
Where do you dwell?

1733
01:44:35.370 --> 01:44:36.800
Are you a married man or a bachelor?

1734
01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:38.130
Answer every man directly.

1735
01:44:38.130 --> 01:44:39.230
Ay, and briefly.

1736
01:44:39.230 --> 01:44:40.400
Ay, and wisely.

1737
01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:41.670
Ay, and truly, you were best.

1738
01:44:41.670 --> 01:44:42.770
What is my name?

1739
01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:43.870
Whither am I going?

1740
01:44:43.870 --> 01:44:45.130
Where do I dwell?

1741
01:44:45.130 --> 01:44:48.470
Am I a married man or a bachelor?

1742
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:52.300
Hmm, then, to answer every man directly and briefly,

1743
01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:57.130
wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.

1744
01:44:57.130 --> 01:45:00.230
That's as much as to say they are fools that marry.

1745
01:45:00.230 --> 01:45:02.270
You'll bear me a bang for that, I fear.

1746
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:03.370
Proceed directly.

1747
01:45:03.370 --> 01:45:04.670
Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.

1748
01:45:04.670 --> 01:45:05.870
As a friend or an enemy?

1749
01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:07.000
As a friend.

1750
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.270
That matter is answered directly.

1751
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:09.400
For your dwelling, briefly.

1752
01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:10.570
Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.

1753
01:45:10.570 --> 01:45:11.670
Your name, sir, truly.

1754
01:45:11.670 --> 01:45:12.870
Truly, my name is Cinna.

1755
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:15.200
Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator!

1756
01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:18.000
I'm Cinna the poet! I'm Cinna the poet!

1757
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.200
Tear him for his bad verses! Tear him for his bad verses!

1758
01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:22.470
I am not Cinna the conspirator!

1759
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:23.870
It is no matter, his name's Cinna.

1760
01:45:23.870 --> 01:45:25.600
Pluck but his name out of his heart, and turn him going.

1761
01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:29.200
Tear him! Tear him!

1762
01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:30.970
Tear him!

1763
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:35.300
This many then shall die.

1764
01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:37.570
Their names are prick'd.

1765
01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:43.770
Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?

1766
01:45:45.130 --> 01:45:47.430
I do consent--

1767
01:45:48.970 --> 01:45:50.830
Prick him down, Antony.

1768
01:45:58.100 --> 01:46:01.270
Upon condition Publius shall not live,

1769
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:03.930
who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.

1770
01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:19.930
He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.

1771
01:46:22.130 --> 01:46:27.630
But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house, fetch the will hither,

1772
01:46:27.630 --> 01:46:31.770
and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies.

1773
01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:36.230
What, shall I find you here?

1774
01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.530
Or here, or at the Capitol.

1775
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:07.430
This is a slight unmeritable man, meet to be sent on errands.

1776
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:10.970
Is it fit, the three-fold world divided,

1777
01:47:10.970 --> 01:47:13.170
he should stand one of the three to share it?

1778
01:47:13.170 --> 01:47:14.400
So you thought him,

1779
01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:16.600
and took his voice who should be prick'd to die

1780
01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:19.430
in our black sentence and proscription.

1781
01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:27.170
Octavius, I have seen more days than you,

1782
01:47:27.170 --> 01:47:29.430
and though we lay these honors on this man

1783
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:33.730
to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,

1784
01:47:33.730 --> 01:47:36.930
he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,

1785
01:47:36.930 --> 01:47:39.230
to groan and sweat under the business,

1786
01:47:39.230 --> 01:47:41.100
either led or driven, as we point the way;

1787
01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:44.030
and having brought our treasure where we will,

1788
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:47.630
then take we down his load and turn him off,

1789
01:47:47.630 --> 01:47:52.430
like to the empty ass, to shake his ears and graze in commons.

1790
01:47:55.130 --> 01:48:00.100
You may do your will, but he's a tried and valiant soldier.

1791
01:48:01.970 --> 01:48:04.100
So is my horse, Octavius,

1792
01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:08.100
and for that I do appoint him store of provender?

1793
01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:12.470
It is a creature that I teach to fight, to wind,

1794
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:14.270
to stop, to run directly on,

1795
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:16.800
and, in some taste, is Lepidus but so:

1796
01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:19.330
he must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth;

1797
01:48:19.330 --> 01:48:25.000
a barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds on objects, arts,

1798
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.370
and imitations, which, out of use and staled by other men,

1799
01:48:28.370 --> 01:48:30.430
begin his fashion.

1800
01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:33.000
Do not talk of him but as a property.

1801
01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:40.200
Now, Octavius...

1802
01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:42.630
listen great things.

1803
01:48:42.630 --> 01:48:46.530
Brutus and Cassius are levying powers;

1804
01:48:46.530 --> 01:48:47.900
we must straight make head;

1805
01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:50.530
therefore let our alliance be combined,

1806
01:48:50.530 --> 01:48:54.400
our best friends made, our means stretch'd;

1807
01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:57.130
and let us presently go sit in council,

1808
01:48:57.130 --> 01:49:00.670
how covert matters may be best disclosed,

1809
01:49:00.670 --> 01:49:03.830
and open perils surest answered.

1810
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:06.500
Let us do so, for we are at the stake,

1811
01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:09.170
and bay'd about with many enemies;

1812
01:49:09.170 --> 01:49:13.430
and some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,

1813
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:16.230
millions of mischiefs.

1814
01:49:25.770 --> 01:49:27.330
What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?

1815
01:49:27.330 --> 01:49:29.100
He is at hand,

1816
01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:30.570
and Pindarus is come to do you salutation from his master.

1817
01:49:30.570 --> 01:49:32.000
He greets me well.

1818
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.530
Your master, Pindarus, in his own change, or by ill officers,

1819
01:49:35.530 --> 01:49:38.900
hath given me some worthy cause to wish things done undone;

1820
01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:40.870
but if he be at hand, I shall be satisfied.

1821
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:42.730
I do not doubt but that my noble master

1822
01:49:42.730 --> 01:49:45.600
will appear such as he is, full of regard and honor.

1823
01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:47.230
He is not doubted.

1824
01:49:47.230 --> 01:49:50.830
A word, Lucilius.

1825
01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:52.130
How he received you?

1826
01:49:52.130 --> 01:49:53.430
Let me be resolved.

1827
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:55.800
With courtesy and with respect enough,

1828
01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:57.700
but not with such familiar instances,

1829
01:49:57.700 --> 01:49:59.430
nor with such free and friendly conference,

1830
01:49:59.430 --> 01:50:00.700
as he hath used of old.

1831
01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:05.100
Thou hast described a hot friend cooling.

1832
01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:07.630
Ever note, Lucilius, when love begins to sicken and decay

1833
01:50:07.630 --> 01:50:09.730
it useth an enforced ceremony.

1834
01:50:09.730 --> 01:50:12.400
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;

1835
01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:15.370
but hollow men, like horses hot at hand,

1836
01:50:15.370 --> 01:50:17.470
make gallant show and promise of their mettle;

1837
01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:20.130
but when they should endure the bloody spur,

1838
01:50:20.130 --> 01:50:23.470
they fall their crests and like deceitful jades

1839
01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:25.070
sink in the trial.

1840
01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:27.630
Comes his army on?

1841
01:50:27.630 --> 01:50:29.300
They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter'd;

1842
01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:30.570
the greater part, the horse in general,

1843
01:50:30.570 --> 01:50:32.270
are come with Cassius.

1844
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:33.800
Hark, he is arrived.

1845
01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:35.570
March gently on to meet him.

1846
01:50:35.570 --> 01:50:36.770
Stand, ho.

1847
01:50:36.770 --> 01:50:38.000
Speak the word along.

1848
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.070
Stand ho!

1849
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:42.470
Stand ho!

1850
01:50:46.770 --> 01:50:48.600
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.

1851
01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:50.000
Judge me, you gods.

1852
01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.730
Wrong I mine enemies?

1853
01:50:51.730 --> 01:50:53.370
And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?

1854
01:50:53.370 --> 01:50:56.430
Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,

1855
01:50:56.430 --> 01:50:57.700
and when you do them--

1856
01:50:57.700 --> 01:50:59.970
Cassius, be content, speak your griefs softly,

1857
01:50:59.970 --> 01:51:01.530
I do know you well.

1858
01:51:01.530 --> 01:51:03.170
Before the eyes of both our armies here,

1859
01:51:03.170 --> 01:51:04.600
which should perceive nothing but love from us,

1860
01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:05.830
let us not wrangle.

1861
01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:08.830
Bid them move away; then in my tent, Cassius,

1862
01:51:08.830 --> 01:51:11.030
enlarge your griefs, and I will give you audience.

1863
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:14.470
Pindarus, bid our commanders lead their charges

1864
01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:16.100
off a little from this ground.

1865
01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:18.570
Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man come to our tent

1866
01:51:18.570 --> 01:51:20.530
till we have done our conference.

1867
01:51:20.530 --> 01:51:24.070
Lucius and Titinius, guard our door.

1868
01:51:32.570 --> 01:51:35.030
That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:

1869
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:37.070
you have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella

1870
01:51:37.070 --> 01:51:38.870
for taking bribes here of the Sardians,

1871
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:41.030
wherein my letters, praying on his side,

1872
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:42.830
because I knew the man, were slighted off.

1873
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:44.370
You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.

1874
01:51:44.370 --> 01:51:46.230
In such a time as this it is not meet

1875
01:51:46.230 --> 01:51:48.530
that every nice offense should bear his comment.

1876
01:51:48.530 --> 01:51:50.400
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself are much condemn'd

1877
01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:52.200
to have an itching palm,

1878
01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:55.000
to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers.

1879
01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.700
I an itching palm?

1880
01:51:56.700 --> 01:51:59.230
You know that you are Brutus that speaks this,

1881
01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:01.270
or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.

1882
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:03.630
The name of Cassius honors this corruption,

1883
01:52:03.630 --> 01:52:05.670
and chastisement doth therefore hide his head.

1884
01:52:05.670 --> 01:52:06.930
Chastisement?

1885
01:52:06.930 --> 01:52:10.400
Remember March, the ides of March remember.

1886
01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:13.870
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?

1887
01:52:13.870 --> 01:52:15.100
What villain touch'd his body,

1888
01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:17.030
that did stab, and not for justice?

1889
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:18.430
What, shall one of us,

1890
01:52:18.430 --> 01:52:20.630
that struck the foremost man of all this world

1891
01:52:20.630 --> 01:52:22.230
but for supporting robbers,

1892
01:52:22.230 --> 01:52:25.200
shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes

1893
01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:27.500
and sell the mighty space of our large honors

1894
01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:29.970
for so much trash as may be grasped thus?

1895
01:52:29.970 --> 01:52:32.930
By the gods, I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,

1896
01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:34.600
than such a Roman.

1897
01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:37.400
Brutus, bait not me, I'll not endure it.

1898
01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:38.900
You forget yourself to hedge me in.

1899
01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:41.730
I am a soldier, I, older in practice,

1900
01:52:41.730 --> 01:52:43.400
abler than yourself to make conditions.

1901
01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:44.830
Go to, you are not, Cassius.

1902
01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:46.000
I am.

1903
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.830
I say you are not.

1904
01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:50.000
Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;

1905
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.170
have mind upon your health, tempt me no farther.

1906
01:52:52.170 --> 01:52:53.870
Away, slight man.

1907
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:56.300
Is't possible?

1908
01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:58.730
Hear me, for I will speak.

1909
01:52:58.730 --> 01:53:01.470
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?

1910
01:53:01.470 --> 01:53:03.570
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?

1911
01:53:03.570 --> 01:53:05.230
O gods, ye gods!

1912
01:53:05.230 --> 01:53:06.630
Must I endure all this?

1913
01:53:06.630 --> 01:53:07.730
All this?

1914
01:53:07.730 --> 01:53:09.330
Ay, more!

1915
01:53:09.330 --> 01:53:11.070
Fret till your proud heart break.

1916
01:53:11.070 --> 01:53:13.300
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,

1917
01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:14.970
and make your bondmen tremble.

1918
01:53:14.970 --> 01:53:16.070
Must I bouge?

1919
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:17.670
Must I observe you?

1920
01:53:17.670 --> 01:53:21.030
Must I stand and crouch under your testy humor?

1921
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:23.830
By the gods, you shall digest the venom of your spleen,

1922
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:26.470
though it do split you, for, from this day forth,

1923
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:30.000
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,

1924
01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.600
when you are waspish.

1925
01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:32.930
Is it come to this?

1926
01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:36.370
You say you are the better soldier:

1927
01:53:36.370 --> 01:53:39.100
let it appear so, make your vaunting true,

1928
01:53:39.100 --> 01:53:41.100
and it shall please me well.

1929
01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:44.070
For mine own part, I shall be glad to learn of noble men.

1930
01:53:44.070 --> 01:53:47.400
You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.

1931
01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:50.070
I said, an elder soldier, not a better.

1932
01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:51.330
Did I say "better"?

1933
01:53:51.330 --> 01:53:53.400
If you did, I care not.

1934
01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:56.200
When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.

1935
01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:58.330
Peace, peace.

1936
01:53:58.330 --> 01:54:01.930
You durst not so have tempted him.

1937
01:54:01.930 --> 01:54:03.800
I durst not?

1938
01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:05.670
No.

1939
01:54:05.670 --> 01:54:07.600
What, durst not tempt him?

1940
01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:09.430
For your life you durst not.

1941
01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:11.270
Do not presume too much upon my love;

1942
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:12.830
I may do that I shall be sorry for.

1943
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:15.670
You have done that you should be sorry for.

1944
01:54:15.670 --> 01:54:18.030
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,

1945
01:54:18.030 --> 01:54:20.500
for I am arm'd so strong in honesty,

1946
01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:22.770
that they pass by me as the idle wind

1947
01:54:22.770 --> 01:54:25.430
which I respect not.

1948
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:27.300
I did send to you for certain sums of gold,

1949
01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:31.430
which you denied me, for I can raise no money by vile means.

1950
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:33.200
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart

1951
01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:34.830
and drop my blood for drachmas

1952
01:54:34.830 --> 01:54:36.570
than to wring from the hard hands of peasants

1953
01:54:36.570 --> 01:54:39.230
their vile trash by any indirection.

1954
01:54:39.230 --> 01:54:42.270
I did send to you for gold to pay my legions,

1955
01:54:42.270 --> 01:54:43.600
which you denied me.

1956
01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:45.000
Was that done like Cassius?

1957
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.470
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?

1958
01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:49.530
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous

1959
01:54:49.530 --> 01:54:51.600
to lock such rascal counters from his friends,

1960
01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:53.530
be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,

1961
01:54:53.530 --> 01:54:54.770
Dash him to pieces.

1962
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:55.870
I denied you not.

1963
01:54:55.870 --> 01:54:56.970
You did!

1964
01:54:56.970 --> 01:54:58.930
I did not!

1965
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.030
He was but a fool that brought my answer back.

1966
01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:11.600
Brutus hath rived my heart.

1967
01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:14.070
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,

1968
01:55:14.070 --> 01:55:16.200
but Brutus makes mine greater than they are.

1969
01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:19.170
I do not, till you practise them on me.

1970
01:55:19.170 --> 01:55:21.630
You love me not.

1971
01:55:21.630 --> 01:55:23.830
I do not like your faults.

1972
01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:26.130
A friendly eye could never see such faults.

1973
01:55:26.130 --> 01:55:27.300
A flatterer's would not,

1974
01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:31.800
though they do appear as huge as high Olympus.

1975
01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:35.430
Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,

1976
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:38.470
revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,

1977
01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:40.900
for Cassius is aweary of the world:

1978
01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:45.130
hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;

1979
01:55:45.130 --> 01:55:48.770
check'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,

1980
01:55:48.770 --> 01:55:51.070
set in a notebook, learn'd and conn'd by rote,

1981
01:55:51.070 --> 01:55:53.830
to cast into my teeth.

1982
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:58.770
O, I could weep my spirit from mine eyes!

1983
01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:04.400
There is my dagger, and here my naked breast;

1984
01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:08.030
within, a heart dearer than Pluto's mine, richer than gold.

1985
01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:11.330
If that thou beest a Roman, take it forth;

1986
01:56:11.330 --> 01:56:14.570
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart.

1987
01:56:14.570 --> 01:56:18.530
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar!

1988
01:56:18.530 --> 01:56:21.670
For I know, when thou didst hate him worst,

1989
01:56:21.670 --> 01:56:25.270
thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst Cassius.

1990
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:39.630
Sheathe your dagger.

1991
01:56:42.170 --> 01:56:45.530
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;

1992
01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:49.070
do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.

1993
01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:54.800
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb,

1994
01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:57.630
that carries anger as the flint bears fire,

1995
01:56:57.630 --> 01:56:59.930
who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark

1996
01:56:59.930 --> 01:57:02.100
and straight is cold again.

1997
01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:04.900
Hath Cassius lived

1998
01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:08.370
to be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,

1999
01:57:08.370 --> 01:57:12.200
when grief and blood ill-temper'd vexeth him?

2000
01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:15.330
When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.

2001
01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:20.970
Do you confess so much?

2002
01:57:24.430 --> 01:57:27.600
Give me your hand.

2003
01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:30.800
And my heart too.

2004
01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:33.970
O Brutus.

2005
01:57:39.630 --> 01:57:41.570
What's the matter?

2006
01:57:41.570 --> 01:57:44.400
Have not you love enough to bear with me

2007
01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:47.070
when that rash humor which my mother gave me

2008
01:57:47.070 --> 01:57:49.400
makes me forgetful?

2009
01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:53.030
Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,

2010
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:55.900
when you are overearnest with your Brutus,

2011
01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:59.870
he'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.

2012
01:57:59.870 --> 01:58:01.800
Let me go in to see the generals.

2013
01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:03.270
There is some grudge between 'em,

2014
01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:04.430
'tis not meet they be alone.

2015
01:58:04.430 --> 01:58:05.530
You shall not come to them.

2016
01:58:05.530 --> 01:58:07.430
Nothing but death shall stay me.

2017
01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:09.070
How now, what's the matter?

2018
01:58:09.070 --> 01:58:11.370
For shame, you generals.

2019
01:58:11.370 --> 01:58:12.630
What do you mean?

2020
01:58:12.630 --> 01:58:16.870
Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;

2021
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:19.930
for I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.

2022
01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:25.900
How vilely doth this cynic rhyme.

2023
01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:28.530
Get you hence, saucy fellow, hence.

2024
01:58:28.530 --> 01:58:30.730
Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.

2025
01:58:30.730 --> 01:58:32.400
I'll know his humor when he knows his time.

2026
01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:34.570
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?

2027
01:58:34.570 --> 01:58:36.170
Companion, hence.

2028
01:58:36.170 --> 01:58:39.670
Away, away, be gone.

2029
01:58:39.670 --> 01:58:41.230
Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders

2030
01:58:41.230 --> 01:58:42.570
prepare to lodge their companies tonight.

2031
01:58:42.570 --> 01:58:43.770
And come yourselves

2032
01:58:43.770 --> 01:58:45.870
and bring Messala with you immediately to us.

2033
01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:48.070
Lucius, a bowl of wine.

2034
01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:04.730
I did not think you could have been so angry.

2035
01:59:04.730 --> 01:59:08.330
O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.

2036
01:59:08.330 --> 01:59:10.870
Of your philosophy you make no use,

2037
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:12.730
if you give place to accidental evils.

2038
01:59:12.730 --> 01:59:15.670
No one bears sorrow better.

2039
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:21.200
Portia is dead.

2040
01:59:26.030 --> 01:59:28.470
Portia?

2041
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:29.900
She is dead.

2042
01:59:32.730 --> 01:59:36.670
How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?

2043
01:59:36.670 --> 01:59:43.600
O insupportable and touching loss.

2044
01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:46.700
Upon what sickness?

2045
01:59:46.700 --> 01:59:50.530
Impatient of my absence, and grief that young Octavius

2046
01:59:50.530 --> 01:59:54.070
with Mark Antony have made themselves so strong--

2047
01:59:54.070 --> 01:59:56.530
for with her death that tidings came--

2048
01:59:56.530 --> 02:00:02.430
with this she fell distract, and, her attendants absent,

2049
02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:06.700
swallow'd fire.

2050
02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:08.100
And died so?

2051
02:00:08.100 --> 02:00:10.100
Even so.

2052
02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:13.530
O ye immortal gods.

2053
02:00:13.530 --> 02:00:16.200
Speak no more of her.

2054
02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:18.570
Give me a bowl of wine.

2055
02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:31.370
In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.

2056
02:00:31.370 --> 02:00:35.300
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.

2057
02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:39.570
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;

2058
02:00:39.570 --> 02:00:43.730
I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.

2059
02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:47.730
Come in, Titinius.

2060
02:00:47.730 --> 02:00:49.730
Welcome, good Messala.

2061
02:00:49.730 --> 02:00:52.230
Now sit we close about this taper here,

2062
02:00:52.230 --> 02:00:53.930
and call in question our necessities.

2063
02:01:01.970 --> 02:01:03.370
Portia, art thou gone?

2064
02:01:03.370 --> 02:01:05.300
No more, I pray you.

2065
02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:08.530
Messala, I have here received letters that young Octavius

2066
02:01:08.530 --> 02:01:11.130
with Mark Antony come down upon us with a mighty power,

2067
02:01:11.130 --> 02:01:13.900
bending their expedition toward Philippi.

2068
02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:15.900
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.

2069
02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:17.070
With what addition?

2070
02:01:17.070 --> 02:01:19.970
That by proscription and bills of outlawry

2071
02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:21.930
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus

2072
02:01:21.930 --> 02:01:23.970
have put to death an hundred senators.

2073
02:01:23.970 --> 02:01:26.330
Therein our letters do not well agree;

2074
02:01:26.330 --> 02:01:28.370
mine speak of seventy senators

2075
02:01:28.370 --> 02:01:31.030
that died by their proscriptions, Cicero being one.

2076
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:32.370
Cicero one?

2077
02:01:32.370 --> 02:01:35.730
Cicero is dead, and by that order of proscription.

2078
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:40.630
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?

2079
02:01:40.630 --> 02:01:42.470
No, Messala.

2080
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:44.830
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?

2081
02:01:44.830 --> 02:01:46.300
Nothing, Messala.

2082
02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:50.630
That, methinks, is strange.

2083
02:01:50.630 --> 02:01:52.100
Why ask you?

2084
02:01:52.100 --> 02:01:53.670
Hear you aught of her in yours?

2085
02:01:53.670 --> 02:01:55.230
No, my lord.

2086
02:01:57.230 --> 02:02:00.830
Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.

2087
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:04.170
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:

2088
02:02:04.170 --> 02:02:08.470
for certain she is dead, and by strange manner.

2089
02:02:12.270 --> 02:02:14.200
Why, farewell, Portia.

2090
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:19.400
We must die, Messala.

2091
02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:22.330
With meditating that she must die once

2092
02:02:22.330 --> 02:02:25.300
I have the patience to endure it now.

2093
02:02:31.530 --> 02:02:36.830
Even so great men great losses should endure.

2094
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:39.630
I have as much of this in art as you,

2095
02:02:39.630 --> 02:02:41.900
but yet my nature could not bear it so.

2096
02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:44.870
Well, to our work alive.

2097
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:48.100
What do you think of marching to Philippi presently?

2098
02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:49.200
I do not think it good.

2099
02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:50.330
Your reason?

2100
02:02:50.330 --> 02:02:53.270
This it is: 'tis better the enemy seek us;

2101
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:56.100
so shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,

2102
02:02:56.100 --> 02:02:58.930
doing himself offense, whilst we lying still are full of rest,

2103
02:02:58.930 --> 02:03:00.630
defense, and nimbleness.

2104
02:03:00.630 --> 02:03:03.300
Good reasons must of force give place to better.

2105
02:03:03.300 --> 02:03:06.070
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground

2106
02:03:06.070 --> 02:03:07.700
do stand but in a forced affection,

2107
02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:09.400
for they have grudged us contribution.

2108
02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:11.300
The enemy, marching along by them,

2109
02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:13.400
by them shall make a fuller number up,

2110
02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:15.670
come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;

2111
02:03:15.670 --> 02:03:18.270
from which advantage shall we cut him off

2112
02:03:18.270 --> 02:03:20.400
if at Philippi we do face him there,

2113
02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:21.600
these people at our back.

2114
02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:23.200
- Hear me, good brother. - Under your pardon.

2115
02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:24.600
You must note beside

2116
02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:27.270
that we have tried the utmost of our friends,

2117
02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:29.770
our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:

2118
02:03:29.770 --> 02:03:32.770
the enemy increaseth every day;

2119
02:03:32.770 --> 02:03:36.630
we, at the height, are ready to decline.

2120
02:03:36.630 --> 02:03:39.570
There is a tide in the affairs of men

2121
02:03:39.570 --> 02:03:42.800
which taken at the flood leads on to fortune;

2122
02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:46.130
omitted, all the voyage of their life

2123
02:03:46.130 --> 02:03:50.730
is bound in shallows and in miseries.

2124
02:03:50.730 --> 02:03:54.030
On such a full sea are we now afloat,

2125
02:03:54.030 --> 02:03:56.530
and we must take the current when it serves,

2126
02:03:56.530 --> 02:03:58.400
or lose our ventures.

2127
02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:11.700
Then, with your will, go on;

2128
02:04:11.700 --> 02:04:15.400
we'll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi.

2129
02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:17.800
The deep of night is crept upon our talk,

2130
02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:20.770
and nature must obey necessity,

2131
02:04:20.770 --> 02:04:23.770
which we will niggard with a little rest.

2132
02:04:26.100 --> 02:04:28.030
There is no more to say?

2133
02:04:28.030 --> 02:04:29.300
No more.

2134
02:04:29.300 --> 02:04:30.870
Good night.

2135
02:04:30.870 --> 02:04:33.330
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.

2136
02:04:33.330 --> 02:04:36.400
Farewell, good Messala; good night, Titinius;

2137
02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:37.630
Good night, lord Brutus.

2138
02:04:37.630 --> 02:04:39.170
Good night, Lord Brutus.

2139
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:53.500
Noble, noble Cassius, good night and good repose.

2140
02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:04.500
O my dear brother.

2141
02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:07.400
This was an ill beginning of the night.

2142
02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:09.500
Never come such division 'tween our souls.

2143
02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:11.030
Let it not, Brutus.

2144
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:12.870
Everything is well.

2145
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:14.970
Good night, my lord.

2146
02:05:14.970 --> 02:05:16.970
Good night, good brother.

2147
02:05:26.170 --> 02:05:28.100
Give me the gown.

2148
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:36.630
Where is thy instrument?

2149
02:05:36.630 --> 02:05:37.870
Here in the tent.

2150
02:05:37.870 --> 02:05:40.370
What, thou speak'st drowsily?

2151
02:05:40.370 --> 02:05:45.570
Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o'erwatch'd.

2152
02:05:45.570 --> 02:05:49.170
Call Claudius and some other of my men,

2153
02:05:49.170 --> 02:05:51.670
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.

2154
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:56.830
Varro and Claudius.

2155
02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:03.400
Calls my lord?

2156
02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:07.530
I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;

2157
02:06:07.530 --> 02:06:09.270
it may be I shall raise you by and by

2158
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:11.170
on business to my brother Cassius.

2159
02:06:11.170 --> 02:06:13.930
So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.

2160
02:06:13.930 --> 02:06:16.330
I will not have it so.

2161
02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:20.000
Lie down, good sirs.

2162
02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:23.230
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.

2163
02:06:37.130 --> 02:06:39.570
Look Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;

2164
02:06:39.570 --> 02:06:41.170
I put it in the pocket of my gown.

2165
02:06:41.170 --> 02:06:43.170
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.

2166
02:06:43.170 --> 02:06:47.900
Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.

2167
02:06:47.900 --> 02:06:50.930
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,

2168
02:06:50.930 --> 02:06:53.030
and touch thy instrument a strain or two?

2169
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:55.700
Ay, my lord, an't please you.

2170
02:06:55.700 --> 02:06:58.400
It does, my boy.

2171
02:06:58.400 --> 02:07:00.770
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.

2172
02:07:00.770 --> 02:07:01.900
It is my duty, sir.

2173
02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:05.130
I should not urge thy duty past thy might;

2174
02:07:05.130 --> 02:07:07.230
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.

2175
02:07:07.230 --> 02:07:09.970
I have slept, my lord, already.

2176
02:07:09.970 --> 02:07:13.270
It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;

2177
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:16.130
I will not hold thee long.

2178
02:07:25.230 --> 02:07:30.200
If I do live, I will be good to thee.

2179
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:45.600
This is a sleepy tune.

2180
02:07:56.070 --> 02:07:58.570
O murtherous slumber,

2181
02:07:58.570 --> 02:08:03.370
layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy that plays thee music?

2182
02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:09.200
Gentle knave, good night.

2183
02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:13.000
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.

2184
02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:19.570
If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;

2185
02:08:19.570 --> 02:08:22.500
I'll take it from thee.

2186
02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:34.130
And, good boy, good night.

2187
02:08:40.030 --> 02:08:45.300
Let me see, let me see;

2188
02:08:45.300 --> 02:08:51.930
is not the leaf turn'd down where I left reading?

2189
02:08:51.930 --> 02:08:53.800
Here it is, I think.

2190
02:08:57.070 --> 02:09:00.230
How ill this taper burns.

2191
02:09:10.370 --> 02:09:12.670
Who comes here?

2192
02:09:12.670 --> 02:09:16.000
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes

2193
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.300
that shapes this monstrous apparition.

2194
02:09:22.730 --> 02:09:24.770
It comes upon me.

2195
02:09:24.770 --> 02:09:26.900
Art thou anything?

2196
02:09:26.900 --> 02:09:31.970
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil

2197
02:09:31.970 --> 02:09:37.730
that makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?

2198
02:09:37.730 --> 02:09:40.230
Speak to me what thou art.

2199
02:09:40.230 --> 02:09:42.630
Thy evil spirit, Brutus.

2200
02:09:42.630 --> 02:09:45.370
Why comest thou?

2201
02:09:45.370 --> 02:09:48.170
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.

2202
02:09:48.170 --> 02:09:52.070
Well, then I shall see thee again?

2203
02:09:52.070 --> 02:09:54.770
Ay, at Philippi.

2204
02:09:54.770 --> 02:09:58.330
Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.

2205
02:10:04.370 --> 02:10:07.130
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest.

2206
02:10:07.130 --> 02:10:12.670
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.

2207
02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:17.100
Boy. Lucius.

2208
02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:18.430
Varro. Claudius.

2209
02:10:18.430 --> 02:10:19.570
Sirs, awake.

2210
02:10:19.570 --> 02:10:20.700
Claudius!

2211
02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:22.470
The strings, my lord, are false.

2212
02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:23.630
He thinks he still is at his instrument.

2213
02:10:23.630 --> 02:10:24.730
Lucius, awake.

2214
02:10:24.730 --> 02:10:25.900
My lord?

2215
02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:27.970
Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?

2216
02:10:27.970 --> 02:10:29.830
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.

2217
02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:31.000
Yes, that thou didst.

2218
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:32.170
Didst thou see anything?

2219
02:10:32.170 --> 02:10:33.630
Nothing, my lord.

2220
02:10:33.630 --> 02:10:35.900
Sleep again, Lucius.

2221
02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:38.070
Sirrah Claudius.

2222
02:10:38.070 --> 02:10:40.630
Fellow thou, awake.

2223
02:10:40.630 --> 02:10:41.930
My lord?

2224
02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:43.130
My lord?

2225
02:10:43.130 --> 02:10:45.130
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?

2226
02:10:45.130 --> 02:10:46.670
- Did we, my lord? - Did we, my lord?

2227
02:10:46.670 --> 02:10:49.500
Ay, saw you anything?

2228
02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:51.570
No, my lord, I saw nothing.

2229
02:10:51.570 --> 02:10:53.200
Nor I, my lord.

2230
02:10:57.500 --> 02:11:00.270
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;

2231
02:11:00.270 --> 02:11:05.670
bid him set on his powers betimes before,

2232
02:11:05.670 --> 02:11:08.030
and we will follow.

2233
02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:10.570
It shall be done, my lord.

2234
02:11:16.670 --> 02:11:18.670
Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.

2235
02:11:18.670 --> 02:11:20.770
You said the enemy would not come down,

2236
02:11:20.770 --> 02:11:22.170
but keep the hills and upper regions.

2237
02:11:22.170 --> 02:11:23.300
It proves not so.

2238
02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:24.500
Their battles are at hand;

2239
02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:27.030
they mean to warn us at Philippi here,

2240
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:28.930
answering before we do demand of them.

2241
02:11:28.930 --> 02:11:32.730
Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know wherefore they do it.

2242
02:11:32.730 --> 02:11:35.230
They could be content to visit other places,

2243
02:11:35.230 --> 02:11:38.030
and come down with fearful bravery,

2244
02:11:38.030 --> 02:11:40.170
thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts

2245
02:11:40.170 --> 02:11:42.270
that they have courage; but 'tis not so.

2246
02:11:42.270 --> 02:11:43.430
Prepare you, generals.

2247
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:45.470
The enemy comes on in gallant show;

2248
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:46.930
their bloody sign of battle is hung out,

2249
02:11:46.930 --> 02:11:49.000
and something to be done immediately.

2250
02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.400
Octavius, lead your battle softly on,

2251
02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:53.900
upon the left hand of the even field.

2252
02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:56.700
Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.

2253
02:11:56.700 --> 02:11:59.370
Why do you cross me in this exigent?

2254
02:11:59.370 --> 02:12:02.400
I do not cross you, but I will do so.

2255
02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:06.100
They stand, and would have parley.

2256
02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:09.830
Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.

2257
02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:12.430
Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?

2258
02:12:12.430 --> 02:12:17.530
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.

2259
02:12:19.330 --> 02:12:21.770
Make forth, the generals would have some words.

2260
02:12:21.770 --> 02:12:23.100
Stir not until the signal.

2261
02:12:37.530 --> 02:12:40.330
Words before blows.

2262
02:12:40.330 --> 02:12:41.470
Is it so, countrymen?

2263
02:12:41.470 --> 02:12:43.200
Not that we love words better, as you do.

2264
02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:46.070
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.

2265
02:12:46.070 --> 02:12:48.800
In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.

2266
02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:52.500
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,

2267
02:12:52.500 --> 02:12:55.670
crying, "Long live. Hail, Caesar."

2268
02:12:55.670 --> 02:12:59.400
Antony, the posture of your blows are yet unknown;

2269
02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:03.470
but for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,

2270
02:13:03.470 --> 02:13:04.930
and leave them honeyless.

2271
02:13:04.930 --> 02:13:06.800
Not stingless too.

2272
02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:11.600
O, yes, and soundless too, for you have stol'n their buzzing,

2273
02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:14.430
Antony, and very wisely threat before you sting.

2274
02:13:14.430 --> 02:13:18.570
Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers

2275
02:13:18.570 --> 02:13:20.570
hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar.

2276
02:13:20.570 --> 02:13:23.970
You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,

2277
02:13:23.970 --> 02:13:26.870
and bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;

2278
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:29.000
whilst damned Casca, like a cur,

2279
02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.600
behind struck Caesar on the neck.

2280
02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:33.500
O you flatterers!

2281
02:13:33.500 --> 02:13:35.730
Flatterers?

2282
02:13:35.730 --> 02:13:37.170
Now, Brutus, thank yourself.

2283
02:13:37.170 --> 02:13:39.270
This tongue had not offended so today,

2284
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:40.770
if Cassius might have ruled.

2285
02:13:40.770 --> 02:13:42.330
Come, come, the cause.

2286
02:13:42.330 --> 02:13:43.430
If arguing make us sweat,

2287
02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:45.600
the proof of it will turn to redder drops.

2288
02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:50.370
Look, I draw a sword against conspirators;

2289
02:13:50.370 --> 02:13:52.400
when think you that the sword goes up again?

2290
02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:58.370
Never, till Caesar's three and twenty wounds be well avenged,

2291
02:13:58.370 --> 02:13:59.770
or till another Caesar

2292
02:13:59.770 --> 02:14:02.870
have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.

2293
02:14:06.170 --> 02:14:08.270
Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,

2294
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:10.430
unless thou bring'st them with thee.

2295
02:14:10.430 --> 02:14:14.470
So I hope, I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.

2296
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:18.530
O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, young man,

2297
02:14:18.530 --> 02:14:21.270
thou couldst not die more honorable.

2298
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:25.000
A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,

2299
02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.670
join'd with a masker and a reveler.

2300
02:14:27.670 --> 02:14:31.000
Old Cassius still.

2301
02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:32.730
Come, Antony, away.

2302
02:14:32.730 --> 02:14:36.400
Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.

2303
02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:40.130
If you dare fight today, come to the field;

2304
02:14:40.130 --> 02:14:42.830
if not, when you have stomachs.

2305
02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:00.130
Messala.

2306
02:15:00.130 --> 02:15:01.400
What says my general?

2307
02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:03.070
Messala...

2308
02:15:05.730 --> 02:15:09.430
this is my birthday.

2309
02:15:09.430 --> 02:15:12.370
At this very day was Cassius born.

2310
02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:16.330
Give me thy hand, Messala.

2311
02:15:19.230 --> 02:15:22.700
Be thou my witness that, against my will, as Pompey was,

2312
02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:25.830
am I compell'd to set upon one battle all our liberties.

2313
02:15:30.800 --> 02:15:35.500
You know that I held Epicurus strong, and his opinion.

2314
02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:42.100
Now I change my mind, and partly credit things that do presage.

2315
02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:44.570
Coming from Sardis,

2316
02:15:44.570 --> 02:15:48.830
upon our former ensign two mighty eagles fell,

2317
02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:50.570
and there they perch'd,

2318
02:15:50.570 --> 02:15:53.500
gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands,

2319
02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:55.130
who to Philippi here consorted us.

2320
02:15:58.230 --> 02:16:02.370
This morning are they fled away and gone,

2321
02:16:02.370 --> 02:16:05.730
and in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites

2322
02:16:05.730 --> 02:16:07.230
fly o'er our heads

2323
02:16:07.230 --> 02:16:11.270
and downward look on us, as we were sickly prey.

2324
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:15.730
Their shadows seem a canopy most fatal,

2325
02:16:15.730 --> 02:16:19.230
under which our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.

2326
02:16:19.230 --> 02:16:20.630
Believe not so.

2327
02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:26.930
I but believe it partly, for I am fresh of spirit

2328
02:16:26.930 --> 02:16:30.300
and resolved to meet all perils very constantly.

2329
02:17:16.370 --> 02:17:18.870
Now, most noble Brutus,

2330
02:17:18.870 --> 02:17:23.130
the gods today stand friendly that we may,

2331
02:17:23.130 --> 02:17:27.600
lovers in peace, lead on our days to age.

2332
02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:31.530
But, since the affairs of men rest still incertain,

2333
02:17:31.530 --> 02:17:35.130
let's reason with the worst that may befall.

2334
02:17:35.130 --> 02:17:40.970
If we do lose this battle, then is this the last time

2335
02:17:40.970 --> 02:17:44.770
that you and I will speak together?

2336
02:17:44.770 --> 02:17:47.600
What are you then determined to do?

2337
02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:51.230
Even by the rule of that philosophy by which

2338
02:17:51.230 --> 02:17:54.470
I did blame Cato for the death which he did give himself--

2339
02:17:54.470 --> 02:17:59.530
I know not how, but I do find it cowardly and vile,

2340
02:17:59.530 --> 02:18:03.300
for fear of what might fall, so to prevent the time of life--

2341
02:18:03.300 --> 02:18:06.230
arming myself with patience to stay the providence

2342
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:09.100
of some high powers that govern us below.

2343
02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:11.170
Then, if we do lose this battle,

2344
02:18:11.170 --> 02:18:13.070
you are contented to be led in triumph

2345
02:18:13.070 --> 02:18:14.330
through the streets of Rome?

2346
02:18:14.330 --> 02:18:17.930
No, Cassius, no.

2347
02:18:17.930 --> 02:18:19.630
Think not, thou noble Roman,

2348
02:18:19.630 --> 02:18:22.770
that ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;

2349
02:18:22.770 --> 02:18:25.470
he bears too great a mind.

2350
02:18:25.470 --> 02:18:32.130
But this same day must end that work the ides of March begun.

2351
02:18:32.130 --> 02:18:37.270
And whether we shall meet again I know not.

2352
02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:40.130
Therefore our everlasting farewell take.

2353
02:18:40.130 --> 02:18:44.670
Forever and forever farewell, Cassius.

2354
02:18:44.670 --> 02:18:49.700
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;

2355
02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:55.170
If not, why then this parting was well made.

2356
02:18:55.170 --> 02:19:00.870
Forever and forever farewell, Brutus.

2357
02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:04.300
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;

2358
02:19:04.300 --> 02:19:09.300
if not, 'tis true this parting was well made.

2359
02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:14.770
Why then, lead on.

2360
02:19:21.670 --> 02:19:22.970
O, that a man might know

2361
02:19:22.970 --> 02:19:26.430
the end of this day's business ere it come.

2362
02:19:26.430 --> 02:19:30.600
But it sufficeth that the day will end,

2363
02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:33.970
and then the end is known.

2364
02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:38.300
Ride, ride, Messala, ride,

2365
02:19:38.300 --> 02:19:40.930
and give these bills unto the legions on the other side.

2366
02:19:40.930 --> 02:19:42.430
Let them set on at once,

2367
02:19:42.430 --> 02:19:44.930
for I perceive but cold demeanor in Octavia's wing,

2368
02:19:44.930 --> 02:19:47.270
and sudden push gives them the overthrow.

2369
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:49.830
Ride, ride, Messala!

2370
02:19:49.830 --> 02:19:53.000
Let them all come down!

2371
02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:57.730
O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly.

2372
02:19:57.730 --> 02:19:59.500
Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy.

2373
02:19:59.500 --> 02:20:01.170
This ensign here of mine was turning back;

2374
02:20:01.170 --> 02:20:02.970
I slew the coward, and did take it from him.

2375
02:20:02.970 --> 02:20:05.100
O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,

2376
02:20:05.100 --> 02:20:08.000
who, having some advantage on Octavius, took it too eagerly.

2377
02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:09.300
His soldiers fell to spoil,

2378
02:20:09.300 --> 02:20:11.870
whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.

2379
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:14.700
Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;

2380
02:20:14.700 --> 02:20:17.070
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord;

2381
02:20:17.070 --> 02:20:20.000
Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.

2382
02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:21.470
This hill is far enough.

2383
02:20:23.270 --> 02:20:25.200
Look, look, Titinius:

2384
02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:27.500
are those my tents where I perceive the fire?

2385
02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:29.000
They are, my lord.

2386
02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:30.500
Titinius, if thou lovest me,

2387
02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:32.330
mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him,

2388
02:20:32.330 --> 02:20:34.430
till he have brought thee up to yonder troops and here again,

2389
02:20:34.430 --> 02:20:37.670
that I may rest assured whether yond troops be friend or enemy.

2390
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:40.570
I will be here again, even with a thought.

2391
02:20:40.570 --> 02:20:44.330
Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;

2392
02:20:44.330 --> 02:20:47.400
my sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,

2393
02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:49.670
and tell me what thou notest about the field.

2394
02:20:51.430 --> 02:20:55.500
This day I breathed first: time is come round,

2395
02:20:55.500 --> 02:20:59.070
and where I did begin, there shall I end;

2396
02:20:59.070 --> 02:21:01.370
my life is run his compass.

2397
02:21:01.370 --> 02:21:04.170
Sirrah, what news?

2398
02:21:04.170 --> 02:21:05.530
O my lord!

2399
02:21:05.530 --> 02:21:06.830
What news?

2400
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:09.830
Titinius is enclosed round about with horsemen,

2401
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:14.170
that make to him on the spur; yet he spurs on!

2402
02:21:14.170 --> 02:21:17.270
Now they are almost on him!

2403
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:19.130
Now, Titinius!

2404
02:21:19.130 --> 02:21:22.300
Now some light.

2405
02:21:22.300 --> 02:21:28.970
O, he lights too.

2406
02:21:28.970 --> 02:21:31.100
He's ta'en.

2407
02:21:31.100 --> 02:21:33.530
And, hark.

2408
02:21:33.530 --> 02:21:36.800
They shout for joy.

2409
02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:42.800
Come down; behold no more.

2410
02:21:42.800 --> 02:21:49.370
O, coward that I am, to live so long,

2411
02:21:49.370 --> 02:21:53.330
to see my best friend ta'en before my face.

2412
02:21:57.100 --> 02:21:58.370
Come hither, Sirrah.

2413
02:22:02.270 --> 02:22:06.030
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,

2414
02:22:06.030 --> 02:22:09.630
and then I swore thee, saving of thy life,

2415
02:22:09.630 --> 02:22:12.130
that whatsoever I did bidst thee do,

2416
02:22:12.130 --> 02:22:13.330
thou shouldst attempt it.

2417
02:22:13.330 --> 02:22:15.730
Come now, keep thine oath;

2418
02:22:15.730 --> 02:22:21.470
now be a freeman, and with this good sword,

2419
02:22:21.470 --> 02:22:24.570
that ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.

2420
02:22:24.570 --> 02:22:30.370
Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;

2421
02:22:30.370 --> 02:22:33.200
and when my face is cover'd...

2422
02:22:37.430 --> 02:22:41.230
as 'tis now, guide thou the sword.

2423
02:22:52.870 --> 02:22:54.130
Caesar...

2424
02:22:56.800 --> 02:23:01.230
thou art...

2425
02:23:01.230 --> 02:23:05.100
even with the sword that kill'd thee.

2426
02:23:24.270 --> 02:23:30.400
So, I am free,

2427
02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:35.630
yet would not so have been, durst I have done my will.

2428
02:23:35.630 --> 02:23:37.330
O Cassius.

2429
02:23:39.800 --> 02:23:43.130
Far from this country Pindarus shall run,

2430
02:23:43.130 --> 02:23:46.730
where never Roman shall take note of him.

2431
02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:55.730
It is but change, Titinius,

2432
02:23:55.730 --> 02:23:58.400
for Octavius is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,

2433
02:23:58.400 --> 02:23:59.970
as Cassius' legions are by Antony.

2434
02:23:59.970 --> 02:24:01.900
Then these tidings would well comfort Cassius.

2435
02:24:01.900 --> 02:24:03.270
Where did you leave him?

2436
02:24:03.270 --> 02:24:05.630
All disconsolate, with Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.

2437
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:11.000
Is not that he that lies upon the ground?

2438
02:24:14.470 --> 02:24:18.200
He lies not like the living.

2439
02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:21.170
O my heart.

2440
02:24:21.170 --> 02:24:22.570
Is not that he?

2441
02:24:25.430 --> 02:24:33.300
No, this was he, Messala, but Cassius is no more.

2442
02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:40.970
O setting sun, as in thy red rays thou dost sink to night,

2443
02:24:40.970 --> 02:24:46.570
so in his red blood does Cassius' day set,

2444
02:24:46.570 --> 02:24:50.100
the sun of Rome is set.

2445
02:24:50.100 --> 02:24:57.300
Our day is gone; clouds, dews, and dangers come;

2446
02:24:57.300 --> 02:25:00.700
our deeds are done.

2447
02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:04.700
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.

2448
02:25:04.700 --> 02:25:08.200
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.

2449
02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:14.800
O hateful error, melancholy's child,

2450
02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:17.270
why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men

2451
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:19.870
the things that are not?

2452
02:25:19.870 --> 02:25:24.930
O error, soon conceived, thou never comest unto a happy birth,

2453
02:25:24.930 --> 02:25:28.100
but kill'st the mother that engender'd thee.

2454
02:25:28.100 --> 02:25:29.200
What, Pindarus!

2455
02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:31.270
Where art thou, Pindarus?

2456
02:25:31.270 --> 02:25:35.270
Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet the noble Brutus,

2457
02:25:35.270 --> 02:25:37.830
thrusting this report into his ears.

2458
02:25:37.830 --> 02:25:39.330
I may say "thrusting" it,

2459
02:25:39.330 --> 02:25:41.870
for piercing steel and darts envenomed

2460
02:25:41.870 --> 02:25:44.630
shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus

2461
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:46.700
as tidings of this sight.

2462
02:25:46.700 --> 02:25:49.000
Hie you, Messala.

2463
02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.800
I will seek for Pindarus the while.

2464
02:26:08.170 --> 02:26:13.370
Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?

2465
02:26:13.370 --> 02:26:17.700
Did I not meet thy friends?

2466
02:26:17.700 --> 02:26:22.770
And did not they put on my brow this wreath of victory,

2467
02:26:22.770 --> 02:26:25.070
and bid me give it thee?

2468
02:26:25.070 --> 02:26:28.570
Didst thou not hear their shouts?

2469
02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:39.630
Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything.

2470
02:26:39.630 --> 02:26:45.230
But, hold thee,

2471
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:49.070
take thou this garland on thy brow;

2472
02:26:49.070 --> 02:26:54.000
thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I will do his bidding.

2473
02:26:57.900 --> 02:27:03.570
Brutus, come apace, and see how I regarded Caius Cassius.

2474
02:27:08.800 --> 02:27:15.970
By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.

2475
02:27:15.970 --> 02:27:25.800
Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.

2476
02:27:36.830 --> 02:27:40.300
Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?

2477
02:27:40.300 --> 02:27:43.270
Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.

2478
02:27:58.530 --> 02:28:00.470
Titinius' face is upward.

2479
02:28:05.470 --> 02:28:07.230
He is slain.

2480
02:28:12.370 --> 02:28:15.770
O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet.

2481
02:28:15.770 --> 02:28:19.500
Thy spirit walks abroad,

2482
02:28:19.500 --> 02:28:22.630
and turns our swords in our own proper entrails.

2483
02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:23.800
Brave Titinius.

2484
02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:28.230
Look whe'er he have not crown'd dead Cassius.

2485
02:28:28.230 --> 02:28:33.730
Are yet two Romans living such as these?

2486
02:28:33.730 --> 02:28:38.970
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well.

2487
02:28:38.970 --> 02:28:42.570
It is impossible that Rome should ever breed thy fellow.

2488
02:28:51.230 --> 02:28:55.730
Friends, I owe more tears to this dead man

2489
02:28:55.730 --> 02:28:59.270
than you shall ever see me pay.

2490
02:29:02.470 --> 02:29:08.170
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.

2491
02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:16.870
Come therefore, and to Thasos send his body;

2492
02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:20.230
his funerals shall not be in our camp, lest it discomfort us.

2493
02:29:20.230 --> 02:29:22.930
Lucilius, come, and come, young Cato; let us to the field.

2494
02:29:22.930 --> 02:29:25.130
Labio and Flavios, set our battles on.

2495
02:29:25.130 --> 02:29:27.970
'Tis three o'clock, and Romans, yet ere night

2496
02:29:27.970 --> 02:29:30.130
we shall try fortune in a second fight.

2497
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:37.400
Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!

2498
02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:38.630
What bastard doth not?

2499
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:39.770
Who will go with me?

2500
02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:41.630
I will proclaim my name about the field.

2501
02:29:41.630 --> 02:29:43.630
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!

2502
02:29:43.630 --> 02:29:46.030
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend.

2503
02:29:46.030 --> 02:29:49.270
I am the son of Marcus Cato!

2504
02:29:49.270 --> 02:29:51.630
And I am Brutus!

2505
02:29:51.630 --> 02:29:53.700
Marcus Brutus, I!

2506
02:29:53.700 --> 02:29:57.100
Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus.

2507
02:30:20.570 --> 02:30:23.570
O young and noble Cato, art thou down?

2508
02:30:23.570 --> 02:30:26.870
Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius,

2509
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:29.600
and mayst be honor'd, being Cato's son.

2510
02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:31.970
Yield, or thou diest.

2511
02:30:33.770 --> 02:30:36.100
Only I yield to die.

2512
02:30:36.100 --> 02:30:38.070
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight:

2513
02:30:38.070 --> 02:30:39.430
kill Brutus, and be honor'd in his death.

2514
02:30:39.430 --> 02:30:40.530
We must not.

2515
02:30:40.530 --> 02:30:41.630
A noble prisoner.

2516
02:30:41.630 --> 02:30:42.730
Room, ho!

2517
02:30:42.730 --> 02:30:44.000
Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.

2518
02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:45.100
I'll tell the news.

2519
02:30:45.100 --> 02:30:46.200
Here comes the general.

2520
02:30:46.200 --> 02:30:47.930
Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.

2521
02:30:50.170 --> 02:30:51.300
Where is he?

2522
02:30:51.300 --> 02:30:54.600
Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.

2523
02:30:54.600 --> 02:30:57.170
I dare assure thee that no enemy

2524
02:30:57.170 --> 02:30:59.200
shall ever take alive the noble Brutus;

2525
02:30:59.200 --> 02:31:02.330
the gods defend him from so great a shame.

2526
02:31:02.330 --> 02:31:04.630
When you do find him, or alive or dead,

2527
02:31:04.630 --> 02:31:07.270
he will be found like Brutus, like himself.

2528
02:31:07.270 --> 02:31:10.970
This is not Brutus, friends,

2529
02:31:10.970 --> 02:31:13.130
but, I assure you, a prize no less in worth.

2530
02:31:13.130 --> 02:31:16.500
Keep this man safe, give him all kindness;

2531
02:31:16.500 --> 02:31:19.700
I had rather have such men my friends than enemies.

2532
02:31:19.700 --> 02:31:24.130
Go on, and see whether Brutus be alive or dead,

2533
02:31:24.130 --> 02:31:26.170
and bring us word unto Octavius' tent

2534
02:31:26.170 --> 02:31:28.270
how everything is chanced.

2535
02:31:46.930 --> 02:31:52.430
Come hither, poor remains of friends, rest here.

2536
02:31:52.430 --> 02:31:56.230
Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord, he came not back.

2537
02:31:56.230 --> 02:31:58.900
He is or ta'en or slain.

2538
02:31:58.900 --> 02:32:02.000
Sit thee down, Clitus.

2539
02:32:03.800 --> 02:32:08.170
Slaying is the word: it is a deed in fashion.

2540
02:32:11.300 --> 02:32:12.670
Hark thee, Clitus.

2541
02:32:19.130 --> 02:32:22.230
What, I, my lord?

2542
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:24.070
No, not for all the world.

2543
02:32:24.070 --> 02:32:26.230
Peace then, no word.

2544
02:32:26.230 --> 02:32:27.600
I'd rather kill myself.

2545
02:32:36.370 --> 02:32:38.430
Hark thee, Dardanius.

2546
02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.370
Shall I do such a deed?

2547
02:32:56.370 --> 02:32:57.500
O Dardanius.

2548
02:32:57.500 --> 02:32:58.830
O Clitus.

2549
02:32:58.830 --> 02:33:01.200
What ill request did Brutus make to thee?

2550
02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:04.100
To kill him, Clitus.

2551
02:33:04.100 --> 02:33:06.700
Now is that noble vessel full of grief,

2552
02:33:06.700 --> 02:33:09.000
that it runs over even at his eyes.

2553
02:33:23.500 --> 02:33:28.170
Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.

2554
02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:33.530
What says my lord?

2555
02:33:33.530 --> 02:33:37.900
Why, this, Volumnius: the ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me

2556
02:33:37.900 --> 02:33:41.630
two several times by night;

2557
02:33:41.630 --> 02:33:48.770
at Sardis once, and this last night here in Philippi fields.

2558
02:33:48.770 --> 02:33:50.400
I know my hour is come.

2559
02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:52.570
Not so, my lord.

2560
02:33:52.570 --> 02:33:55.330
Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.

2561
02:33:55.330 --> 02:34:00.600
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;

2562
02:34:00.600 --> 02:34:06.730
our enemies have beat us to the pit;

2563
02:34:06.730 --> 02:34:09.670
It is more worthy that we should leap in ourselves

2564
02:34:09.670 --> 02:34:11.770
than tarry till they push us.

2565
02:34:15.970 --> 02:34:19.330
Good Volumnius,

2566
02:34:19.330 --> 02:34:24.200
thou know'st that we two went to school together;

2567
02:34:24.200 --> 02:34:27.770
even for that our love of old, I prithee,

2568
02:34:27.770 --> 02:34:31.200
Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.

2569
02:34:36.700 --> 02:34:38.770
That's not an office for a friend, my lord.

2570
02:34:42.370 --> 02:34:47.270
Fly, my lord, fly, there is no tarrying here.

2571
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:50.470
Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.

2572
02:34:50.470 --> 02:34:53.830
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;

2573
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:57.030
farewell to thee too, Strato.

2574
02:34:57.030 --> 02:35:02.100
Countrymen, my heart doth joy

2575
02:35:02.100 --> 02:35:08.370
that yet in all my life I found no man but he was true to me.

2576
02:35:08.370 --> 02:35:12.570
I shall have glory by this losing day,

2577
02:35:12.570 --> 02:35:15.830
more than Octavius and Mark Antony

2578
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:19.600
by this vile conquest shall attain unto.

2579
02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:23.300
So, fare you well at once,

2580
02:35:23.300 --> 02:35:28.200
for Brutus' tongue hath almost ended his life's history.

2581
02:35:28.200 --> 02:35:32.630
Night hangs upon mine eyes,

2582
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:38.070
my bones would rest that have but labor'd

2583
02:35:38.070 --> 02:35:40.970
to attain this hour.

2584
02:35:40.970 --> 02:35:44.330
Fly, my lord, fly.

2585
02:35:44.330 --> 02:35:45.800
Hence, I will follow.

2586
02:35:48.530 --> 02:35:53.130
I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.

2587
02:35:53.130 --> 02:35:55.700
Thou art a fellow of a good respect;

2588
02:35:55.700 --> 02:35:59.470
thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.

2589
02:35:59.470 --> 02:36:06.000
Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,

2590
02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:07.400
while I do run upon it.

2591
02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:09.030
Wilt thou, Strato?

2592
02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:24.000
Give me your hand first.

2593
02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:25.600
Fare you well, my lord.

2594
02:36:29.530 --> 02:36:31.230
Farewell, good Strato.

2595
02:36:33.770 --> 02:36:36.530
Caesar, now be still;

2596
02:36:36.530 --> 02:36:40.500
I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.

2597
02:37:12.770 --> 02:37:14.270
What man is that?

2598
02:37:14.270 --> 02:37:15.830
My master's man.

2599
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:17.930
Strato, where is thy master?

2600
02:37:17.930 --> 02:37:22.600
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:

2601
02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:25.330
the conquerors can but make a fire of him;

2602
02:37:25.330 --> 02:37:28.800
for Brutus only overcame himself,

2603
02:37:28.800 --> 02:37:32.630
and no man else hath honor by his death.

2604
02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:34.200
So Brutus should be found.

2605
02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:35.770
I thank thee, Brutus,

2606
02:37:35.770 --> 02:37:38.200
that thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.

2607
02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:41.030
All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.

2608
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:47.070
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?

2609
02:37:47.070 --> 02:37:50.200
Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.

2610
02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:51.500
Do so, good Messala.

2611
02:37:51.500 --> 02:37:53.530
How died my master, Strato?

2612
02:37:53.530 --> 02:37:57.430
I held the sword, and he did run on it.

2613
02:37:57.430 --> 02:38:01.830
Octavius, then take him to follow thee

2614
02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:04.130
that did the latest service to my master.

2615
02:38:21.230 --> 02:38:26.370
This was the noblest Roman of them all.

2616
02:38:26.370 --> 02:38:29.300
All the conspirators, save only he,

2617
02:38:29.300 --> 02:38:32.770
did that they did in envy of great Caesar;

2618
02:38:32.770 --> 02:38:38.230
he only, in a general honest thought and common good to all,

2619
02:38:38.230 --> 02:38:40.800
made one of them.

2620
02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:46.400
His life was gentle, and the elements so mix'd in him

2621
02:38:46.400 --> 02:38:50.600
that Nature might stand up and say to all the world,

2622
02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:52.100
"This was a man."

2623
02:38:52.100 --> 02:38:53.670
According to his virtue

2624
02:38:53.670 --> 02:38:57.970
let us use him with all respect and rites of burial.

2625
02:38:57.970 --> 02:39:01.830
Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie,

2626
02:39:01.830 --> 02:39:06.570
most like a soldier, ordered honorably.

2627
02:39:06.570 --> 02:39:09.870
So call the field to rest, and let's away,

2628
02:39:09.870 --> 02:39:13.830
to part the glories of this happy day.

2629
02:41:06.170 --> 02:41:09.170
