163
00:08:00.224 --> 00:08:02.193
We had no voice, we had no presidency,

164
00:08:02.193 --> 00:08:05.990
just were part of somebody
else's power structure.

165
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.576
You ask who's interest.

166
00:08:07.576 --> 00:08:09.889
I ask the question who set it up.

167
00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:13.056
(upbeat island music)

168
00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:16.223
<v ->Alright ladies and gentleman.</v>

169
00:08:16.223 --> 00:08:17.535
Once again, pleasant evening,

170
00:08:17.535 --> 00:08:20.141
and welcome to my island home, Jamaica.

171
00:08:20.141 --> 00:08:22.097
Now you'll realize that we drive

172
00:08:22.097 --> 00:08:23.899
on the left hand side of the road.

173
00:08:23.899 --> 00:08:24.732
Might seem wrong.

174
00:08:24.732 --> 00:08:26.554
But the right side is suicide.

175
00:08:26.554 --> 00:08:27.528
Alright?

176
00:08:27.528 --> 00:08:29.289
So set back, relax, and you enjoy.

177
00:08:29.289 --> 00:08:31.317
Feel free to ask any questions.

178
00:08:31.317 --> 00:08:34.679
I am Carrie and this is
your driver, Phillip.

179
00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.319
Coming up on the left hand side

180
00:08:36.319 --> 00:08:38.836
we have Sandals Royal Jamaica.

181
00:08:38.836 --> 00:08:42.418
Right here we have the
Butch Stewart Resort.

182
00:08:42.418 --> 00:08:43.803
<v Narrator>You're driving on a road</v>

183
00:08:43.803 --> 00:08:45.857
and it is called The Queen's Highway.

184
00:08:45.857 --> 00:08:47.389
When it was built we were ruled over

185
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:49.499
by something called a queen.

186
00:08:49.499 --> 00:08:51.654
We do not have a queen anymore.

187
00:08:51.654 --> 00:08:53.734
<v ->We have a very old McDonald's.</v>

188
00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:56.595
Baskin Robbins, right on left hand,

189
00:08:56.595 --> 00:08:58.273
right hand side, I beg your pardon.

190
00:08:58.273 --> 00:08:59.386
So hey, we have it all,

191
00:08:59.386 --> 00:09:02.190
so all tourists if you even
want to go for ice cream.

192
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.761
There is it, see, McDonald's.

193
00:09:03.761 --> 00:09:05.227
(laughing)

194
00:09:05.227 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Narrator>When we wished for</v>

195
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.491
independence from Great Britain,

196
00:09:07.491 --> 00:09:10.655
we had something else in mind.

197
00:09:10.655 --> 00:09:13.160
We can not now remember what that was.

198
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.923
So, you could imagine how I felt

199
00:09:14.923 --> 00:09:17.557
when one day driving
on The Queen's Highway

200
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.442
I asked myself

201
00:09:18.442 --> 00:09:21.888
is the Jamaica that I
see before me self-ruled,

202
00:09:21.888 --> 00:09:23.396
a worse off place than it was

203
00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:26.424
when dominated by the bad minded English?

204
00:09:26.424 --> 00:09:29.186
<v ->My government in the United Kingdom</v>

205
00:09:29.186 --> 00:09:32.262
has laid down it's responsibilities

206
00:09:32.262 --> 00:09:36.876
and has seized to have any
authority in and over Jamaica,

207
00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:39.043
after more than 300 years.

208
00:09:40.612 --> 00:09:42.235
♪ One love ♪

209
00:09:42.235 --> 00:09:43.847
♪ One heart ♪

210
00:09:43.847 --> 00:09:46.129
♪ Let's join together and ♪

211
00:09:46.129 --> 00:09:48.975
<v ->Countries like Jamaica found that</v>

212
00:09:48.975 --> 00:09:52.358
when they became free

213
00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:56.428
they soon were in every
kind of financial problem.

214
00:09:56.428 --> 00:10:00.481
Because they didn't have
the economic strength to,

215
00:10:00.481 --> 00:10:02.969
shall we say, make it on their own.

216
00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:06.595
They needed time to build economies

217
00:10:06.595 --> 00:10:09.507
that could then make it in the world.

218
00:10:09.507 --> 00:10:12.030
When you see what all the
food from abroad cost,

219
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:16.141
you realize that the food production

220
00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:18.071
to feed ourselves in Jamaica,

221
00:10:18.071 --> 00:10:21.077
is not only a matter
of opportunity for you,

222
00:10:21.077 --> 00:10:24.945
it's a matter of survival for the nation.

223
00:10:24.945 --> 00:10:26.748
Comes 1973.

224
00:10:26.748 --> 00:10:29.732
There is a world convulsion

225
00:10:29.732 --> 00:10:33.087
caused by the oil price increases.

226
00:10:33.087 --> 00:10:36.736
All of a sudden we're
having to find sums of money

227
00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:40.431
we never dreamed of before,
just to make ends meet.

228
00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:42.692
Now what can you do?

229
00:10:42.692 --> 00:10:45.912
First of all you go to the
private banking system.

230
00:10:45.912 --> 00:10:48.477
And you see well can I get
a private banking loan.

231
00:10:48.477 --> 00:10:52.228
Because I'm strapped for
cash, I need some support,

232
00:10:52.228 --> 00:10:55.097
and I having trouble
paying my over seas bills.

233
00:10:55.097 --> 00:10:59.246
<v ->When the private
banks won't lend to you,</v>

234
00:10:59.246 --> 00:11:01.591
then you've go to do something

235
00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:03.722
if you're the leader of a country.

236
00:11:03.722 --> 00:11:05.463
And typically what you've go to do

237
00:11:05.463 --> 00:11:08.032
is to cut back your spending in some way.

238
00:11:08.032 --> 00:11:09.494
And try and get more money.

239
00:11:09.494 --> 00:11:14.288
So that the impact of those
cut backs are not as severe,

240
00:11:14.288 --> 00:11:16.705
as they other wise would be.

241
00:11:16.705 --> 00:11:21.052
It's at that point that you
generally come to the IMF.

242
00:11:21.052 --> 00:11:23.376
<v Protester>We are not for sale.</v>

243
00:11:23.376 --> 00:11:25.001
And tell them

244
00:11:25.001 --> 00:11:29.668
anytime they are willing to
deal with an unruly Jamaican

245
00:11:30.908 --> 00:11:34.750
based on principal,
suffrage, pride, and dignity.

246
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.511
Then we will talk the
investment of the money.

247
00:11:37.511 --> 00:11:40.240
<v ->Bare in mind, this is a country</v>

248
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.823
literally beginning to unravel.

249
00:11:43.868 --> 00:11:47.308
Because it can not finance what it needs.

250
00:11:47.308 --> 00:11:50.043
You can't have no
penicillin in the hospital.

251
00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:52.837
You can't have no wheat to make bread.

252
00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:56.591
<v ->And we would say yep, that's true.</v>

253
00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.629
We understand the crisis you're in.

254
00:11:59.629 --> 00:12:03.129
And we need to fix the underlying reasons.

255
00:12:04.277 --> 00:12:05.949
For that crisis.

256
00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:10.014
And so here is what we think needs doing.

257
00:12:10.014 --> 00:12:11.353
<v ->What you really need</v>

258
00:12:11.353 --> 00:12:14.020
is to sit down with them and say look

259
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.334
can I work out a five year program.

260
00:12:16.334 --> 00:12:19.000
And in the meantime, I'm
strapped for some cash,

261
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.417
so can you help me upfront
get out of the cash bind

262
00:12:21.417 --> 00:12:23.079
and then put it in the context

263
00:12:23.079 --> 00:12:25.643
of a long term development plan.

264
00:12:25.643 --> 00:12:27.079
And they say no.

265
00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:29.989
Long term development is your problem.

266
00:12:29.989 --> 00:12:34.322
We are here only to see who
do you owe the money to,

267
00:12:35.335 --> 00:12:37.473
why are you in a bind,

268
00:12:37.473 --> 00:12:41.532
and we lend you some money
in a very short time frame.

269
00:12:41.532 --> 00:12:43.296
At full interest rate.

270
00:12:43.296 --> 00:12:44.809
To get you out of the bind.

271
00:12:44.809 --> 00:12:49.226
And they then impose upon
you tremendous restrictions

272
00:12:52.187 --> 00:12:54.212
in what you can spend.

273
00:12:54.212 --> 00:12:56.407
<v ->When we reach agreement on</v>

274
00:12:56.407 --> 00:12:58.721
a set of measures on the budget,

275
00:12:58.721 --> 00:13:01.142
on the exchange rate, on monetary policy,

276
00:13:01.142 --> 00:13:05.711
on interest rates, on banks,
on maybe privatization,

277
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:09.645
and say yep we think this
could solve your problem.

278
00:13:09.645 --> 00:13:12.848
<v ->And you say to them
but if I do it that way,</v>

279
00:13:12.848 --> 00:13:16.305
when I finish repay you I'm
gonna be in the bind all over.

280
00:13:16.305 --> 00:13:18.111
Because they can't solve my problem.

281
00:13:18.111 --> 00:13:20.444
They say not our problem.

282
00:13:20.444 --> 00:13:23.974
<v ->Okay, this is the banana plantation.</v>

283
00:13:23.974 --> 00:13:27.990
And you know the banana they
say is just like a woman,

284
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.526
takes nine months for baring.

285
00:13:30.526 --> 00:13:32.060
<v Narrator>You pass a building stranded</v>

286
00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.923
in an acre of over grown grass

287
00:13:33.923 --> 00:13:36.304
and you think to your self
that it's very existence

288
00:13:36.304 --> 00:13:38.961
must fall under the Department of Health.

289
00:13:38.961 --> 00:13:40.313
It is an outhouse.

290
00:13:40.313 --> 00:13:41.911
A public latrine.

291
00:13:41.911 --> 00:13:44.862
But when you look again you see a sign

292
00:13:44.862 --> 00:13:47.105
that proclaims this building as a school.

293
00:13:47.105 --> 00:13:49.689
The sign says, "Basic School".

294
00:13:49.689 --> 00:13:52.651
And what could that
mean, the basic school?

295
00:13:52.651 --> 00:13:53.832
<v Teacher>We have this big word up here.</v>

296
00:13:53.832 --> 00:13:54.934
Who can tell me what is this word?

297
00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:56.336
<v Narrator>But before</v>
you can occupy yourself

298
00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.506
with this question,
your heart skips a beat.

299
00:13:58.506 --> 00:14:00.400
For your driver has decided to over take

300
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.907
the car in front of him.

301
00:14:01.907 --> 00:14:04.007
but it would cause your heart
to skip more than a beat

302
00:14:04.007 --> 00:14:07.172
if you knew there was
not a hospital nearby.

303
00:14:07.172 --> 00:14:09.597
That no new hospitals
have been built in Jamaica

304
00:14:09.597 --> 00:14:12.606
for many years now should not concern you.

305
00:14:12.606 --> 00:14:14.904
You're on your holiday.

306
00:14:14.904 --> 00:14:16.681
<v ->The whole idea was to set conditions</v>

307
00:14:16.681 --> 00:14:19.376
which the government could not meet.

308
00:14:19.376 --> 00:14:21.327
When the government failed to meet them

309
00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:23.262
you would have to renegotiate a new loan

310
00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:25.625
in which the conditions became tighter.

311
00:14:25.625 --> 00:14:28.809
So IMF didn't say cut out
this education program

312
00:14:28.809 --> 00:14:30.575
or cut out this health program.

313
00:14:30.575 --> 00:14:32.474
What IMF said was you must spend

314
00:14:32.474 --> 00:14:35.301
only so much money on
health and education.

315
00:14:35.301 --> 00:14:37.080
And the implication of that

316
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.508
was that you had to cut out some programs.

317
00:14:39.508 --> 00:14:41.934
Essentially what the IMF wanted us to do

318
00:14:41.934 --> 00:14:43.568
was to devalue our currency.

319
00:14:43.568 --> 00:14:44.450
That's the first thing.

320
00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.304
To make our dollar cheaper.

321
00:14:46.304 --> 00:14:48.980
<v ->They needed to expand their exports</v>

322
00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.629
and diminish their imports.

323
00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:53.038
And the best way of doing that

324
00:14:53.038 --> 00:14:56.433
is to make foreign
currency more expansive.

325
00:14:56.433 --> 00:15:00.304
<v ->And since our society
is so heavily dependent on</v>

326
00:15:00.304 --> 00:15:02.600
imported food, imported fuel,

327
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.101
imported books to go to
school, imported medicine.

328
00:15:06.101 --> 00:15:07.175
When we devalue,

329
00:15:07.175 --> 00:15:11.277
the costs of those things we
import go up to the citizens.

330
00:15:11.277 --> 00:15:13.245
And as a result the economy today

331
00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:16.296
is much more under the
control of foreigners.

332
00:15:16.296 --> 00:15:18.539
Not necessarily through direct ownership

333
00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:21.083
but through the mechanism of debt.

334
00:15:21.083 --> 00:15:24.600
In the 1970's we owed 800 million dollars.

335
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.538
By the end of the 1980's we
owed four billion dollars.

336
00:15:28.538 --> 00:15:32.261
Now a days, we owe seven billion dollars.

337
00:15:32.261 --> 00:15:33.628
So the debt is rising.

338
00:15:33.628 --> 00:15:35.472
And all the time the debt is rising,

339
00:15:35.472 --> 00:15:39.070
our capacity to export, to
produce, is getting less.

when you pulled out the stopper.

372
00:17:20.131 --> 00:17:22.411
For you see, Jamaica does not yet have

00:17:22.411 --> 00:17:25.572
a proper way of disposing
of all it's sewage.

And the Atlantic Ocean is even bigger.

There is a world of something in this.

But I can't get into it right now.

They're beaming, alright?

387
00:17:56.601 --> 00:17:58.772
Alright guys, so when you go to the clubs

388
00:17:58.772 --> 00:18:00.059
or anywhere you're going
where your gonna drink,

389
00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:02.531
wear your keys on your arms,
in your hair, on your legs.

390
00:18:02.531 --> 00:18:04.191
Where we can see them.

391
00:18:04.191 --> 00:18:07.625
We'll go to the front desk, get
you a number, take you home.

392
00:18:07.625 --> 00:18:09.100
You puke?

393
00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.997
No problem man.

394
00:18:10.997 --> 00:18:13.080
Drink 'til you're filled.

395
00:18:14.038 --> 00:18:16.426
If you get totally
intoxicated, it's no problem.

00:18:22.504 --> 00:18:26.955
And from the bouncing, we're
gonna warm you up a little bit.

399
00:18:26.955 --> 00:18:28.852
First of all, our very first
move we're gonna be doing,

400
00:18:28.852 --> 00:18:30.306
is moving the feet.

401
00:18:30.306 --> 00:18:32.038
Just putting them forward, left and right.

402
00:18:32.038 --> 00:18:32.871
Stepping forward.

403
00:18:32.871 --> 00:18:33.788
Here we go.

404
00:18:35.521 --> 00:18:37.949
Left and then right, come on.

405
00:18:37.949 --> 00:18:39.616
Left and then right.

406
00:18:42.619 --> 00:18:46.952
(African drumming music and chants)

407
00:19:03.939 --> 00:19:08.939
<v ->Farmin', which is the backbone
of our economy so to speak.</v>

408
00:19:09.279 --> 00:19:11.565
You find that the very farmers,

409
00:19:11.565 --> 00:19:13.721
we are farmin' produce,

410
00:19:13.721 --> 00:19:14.677
you know, right?

411
00:19:14.677 --> 00:19:17.702
You have tons of cabbage
or worse in Jamaica.

412
00:19:17.702 --> 00:19:20.848
Because goods come in from
America selling cheaper.

413
00:19:20.848 --> 00:19:22.562
<v Man>That what produce here.</v>

414
00:19:22.562 --> 00:19:24.377
<v ->Than the produce here.</v>

415
00:19:24.377 --> 00:19:28.710
So you'll find just extracting
more than puttin' in.

416
00:19:30.601 --> 00:19:32.795
<v Narrator>The Jamaica that I knew,</v>

417
00:19:32.795 --> 00:19:34.341
the Jamaica in which I grew up,

418
00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:38.149
is not the Jamaica that you,
a tourist, would see now.

419
00:19:38.149 --> 00:19:41.312
That Jamaica no longer exists.

420
00:19:41.312 --> 00:19:44.655
That Jamaica no longer exists
partly for the usual reason.

421
00:19:44.655 --> 00:19:45.721
The passing of time.

422
00:19:45.721 --> 00:19:49.554
And partly because of
this new global economy.

423
00:19:52.564 --> 00:19:53.825
(birds chirping)

424
00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:56.230
<v ->Well.</v>

425
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:58.403
When you see the onion produce this year,

426
00:19:58.403 --> 00:20:01.467
you can look at every house or every yard

427
00:20:01.467 --> 00:20:03.568
that you see around here.

428
00:20:03.568 --> 00:20:07.568
Everybody, old, young, middle aged,

429
00:20:09.212 --> 00:20:12.398
involved in pickin' out onion.

430
00:20:12.398 --> 00:20:14.123
Sewin' onion.

431
00:20:14.123 --> 00:20:15.138
Reapin' onion.

432

Baggin' up onion.

433
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.452
So everybody was involved
in the production

434
00:20:19.452 --> 00:20:20.934
in this district.

435
00:20:20.934 --> 00:20:25.851
But right now it is just a
trickle, just a debris for them.

436
00:20:26.998 --> 00:20:30.804
<v ->When it's ready for harvesting,

Right out in front of your home.

438
00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:33.412
Being sold.

439
00:20:33.412 --> 00:20:35.152
Potato that's grown in Idaho

440
00:20:35.152 --> 00:20:39.098
are new problems 'cause some of the parts.

441

they had us plantin' peanuts.

450
00:21:00.142 --> 00:21:02.225
All those years are over.

451
00:21:03.242 --> 00:21:04.762
Over and gone.

452
00:21:04.762 --> 00:21:08.297
<v ->All these land is what
we used to farm carrots.</v>

453
00:21:08.297 --> 00:21:10.237
Now we can not farm anymore.

454
00:21:10.237 --> 00:21:13.071
We don't got any market for it.

455
00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:15.821
'Cause it's true findin' carrots.

456
00:21:17.218 --> 00:21:19.943
<v ->It's an insult to our dignity.</v>

457
00:21:19.943 --> 00:21:22.296
To not bein' able to produce and sale

458
00:21:22.296 --> 00:21:25.215
in your own market at home.

459
00:21:25.215 --> 00:21:26.677
<v ->This is a free market.</v>

460
00:21:26.677 --> 00:21:28.754
And I've learned that because of

461
00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:32.102
the financial problem that
the government is under.

462
00:21:32.102 --> 00:21:34.696
With the World Bank and the IMF.

463
00:21:34.696 --> 00:21:37.264
They are the one that
institute the pressure

464
00:21:37.264 --> 00:21:40.238
on the government as far as we learned.

465
00:21:40.238 --> 00:21:43.139
No, we had a protected market.

466
00:21:43.139 --> 00:21:45.559
The government said no import.

467
00:21:45.559 --> 00:21:48.345
And then no, we compete with one another.

468
00:21:48.345 --> 00:21:51.472
But for the time being
you're open for the world.

469
00:21:51.472 --> 00:21:53.468
To compete with the world.

470
00:21:53.468 --> 00:21:55.634
<v ->Before, we was unable
to bring in anything</v>

471
00:21:55.634 --> 00:21:58.623
because of the policy of the country.

472
00:21:58.623 --> 00:22:00.744
But lately it change.

473
00:22:00.744 --> 00:22:02.929
<v ->The difference with a person who comes</v>

474
00:22:02.929 --> 00:22:04.251
in from farm with his trailer

475
00:22:04.251 --> 00:22:07.837
is that he has now been givin'
legal right to bring it in.

476
00:22:07.837 --> 00:22:09.416
So I'm not fighting him.

477
00:22:09.416 --> 00:22:11.326
I'm fighting the policy maker.

478
00:22:11.326 --> 00:22:14.549
The person who is foolish
enough to sign such a policy.

479
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:17.514
<v ->Some of the descriptions in our program</v>

480
00:22:17.514 --> 00:22:19.681
usually seeks to implement

481
00:22:21.008 --> 00:22:22.417
is to get countries to

482
00:22:22.417 --> 00:22:25.667
eliminate artificial barriers to trade.

483
00:22:27.183 --> 00:22:30.862
That would require a country
with an Army program,

484
00:22:30.862 --> 00:22:34.645
not to impose artificial
restrictions on imports.

485
00:22:34.645 --> 00:22:39.645
And not to unduly subsidize exports.

486
00:22:40.423 --> 00:22:42.988
<v ->So when a person brings on his trailer,</v>

487
00:22:42.988 --> 00:22:45.036
whether he's in Kingston or up here,

488
00:22:45.036 --> 00:22:48.180
when that farmer gets smarter
and get on the trailer line,

489
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.460
he will full his pocket of money.

490
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.430
But what will happen to the
other thousands of farmers?

491
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:54.996
We are fattening a few people

492
00:22:54.996 --> 00:22:59.163
at the expense of a whole culture.

493
00:23:00.592 --> 00:23:02.451
That took years to build up.

494
00:23:02.451 --> 00:23:04.881
And you destroy it with
the stroke of the pen.

495
00:23:04.881 --> 00:23:08.025
<v ->He who holds the handle,
and you hold the blade.</v>

496
00:23:08.025 --> 00:23:13.025
You know, if you want
the money badly enough

497
00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:15.317
then you have to agree to his terms.

498
00:23:15.317 --> 00:23:20.067
So ultimately the IMF usually
gets most of their own way.

499
00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.298
<v ->Why did we think they
should reduce trade barriers?</v>

500
00:23:24.298 --> 00:23:28.054
The reason is Jamaica
is a very small country.

501
00:23:28.054 --> 00:23:32.742
It's not a country which
could sort of thrive

502
00:23:32.742 --> 00:23:35.281
by producing only for it's self.

503
00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:38.942
We believe very firmly that
countries are gonna grow better

504
00:23:38.942 --> 00:23:41.379
if they're integrated
into the world economy.

505
00:23:41.379 --> 00:23:43.995
And that means reducing tariffs.

506
00:23:43.995 --> 00:23:47.474
And it needed to allow it's
importers, it's people,

507
00:23:47.474 --> 00:23:50.048
access to goods from
the rest of the world.

508
00:23:50.048 --> 00:23:54.215
Rather than have them rely
on this little economy.

509
00:23:55.311 --> 00:23:57.419
<v Reporter>Market vendors</v>
also complained about

510
00:23:57.419 --> 00:23:58.959
the large number of foreign fruits

511
00:23:58.959 --> 00:24:00.844
and vegetables on the market.

512
00:24:00.844 --> 00:24:04.881
Saying all of the foreign foods
were hurting their business.

513
00:24:04.881 --> 00:24:09.242
<v ->The foreign Irish, the foreign
carrot, the foreign ginger,</v>

514
00:24:09.242 --> 00:24:11.018
everything full up the market.

515
00:24:11.018 --> 00:24:11.963
<v ->But the super markets seem</v>

516
00:24:11.963 --> 00:24:13.874
to be doing well with over seas produce.

517
00:24:13.874 --> 00:24:17.589
As their being sold for
less than the local produce.

518
00:24:17.589 --> 00:24:20.816
So you're saying that the
foreign lettuce and carrots

519
00:24:20.816 --> 00:24:23.910
are less expensive then the
local lettuce and carrot?

520
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.168
<v ->Yes, that's what I'm seeing.</v>

521
00:24:26.168 --> 00:24:30.075
<v ->When you open up the market place,</v>

522
00:24:30.075 --> 00:24:31.514
those who are in a better position

523
00:24:31.514 --> 00:24:34.785
to take advantage of the market do so.

524
00:24:34.785 --> 00:24:37.261
<v ->We import the spray,
we import the fertilizer,</v>

525
00:24:37.261 --> 00:24:39.060
we import the seed.

526
00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.367
So what we have to put in?

527
00:24:41.367 --> 00:24:43.287
Only the sunlight.

528
00:24:43.287 --> 00:24:44.370
Only in pack.

529
00:24:45.321 --> 00:24:47.678
And if we use that right
we produce a better quality

530
00:24:47.678 --> 00:24:49.428
but at a higher cost.

531
00:24:52.944 --> 00:24:57.565
<v ->The problem is that we are competing</v>

532
00:24:57.565 --> 00:25:00.507
with an unfair situation.

533
00:25:00.507 --> 00:25:04.924
In this days, nobody hires
money for over 10 percent.

534
00:25:05.825 --> 00:25:09.488
The lowest cost here now is 19 percent.

535
00:25:09.488 --> 00:25:12.088
And it can be as high as 40 percent.

536
00:25:12.088 --> 00:25:15.092
<v ->In Washington they just
looked at us and said</v>

537
00:25:15.092 --> 00:25:20.039
no, no, no, no, you're inflation
last year was 18 percent.

538
00:25:20.039 --> 00:25:23.100
And under the positive inflation
rate theory of interest,

539
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.894
that means we're not allowing
you to lend your farmers

540
00:25:26.894 --> 00:25:30.394
our money which we lend you at 12 percent.

541
00:25:31.696 --> 00:25:33.627
You must charge 23 percent.

542
00:25:33.627 --> 00:25:36.471
I remember I took two
trips, it was, to Washington

543
00:25:36.471 --> 00:25:40.138
to say it is wrong, it is
wrong, you can not make policy.

544
00:25:40.138 --> 00:25:42.826
It is wrong socially.

545
00:25:42.826 --> 00:25:47.826
It is wrong to say that
we must force the farmers

546
00:25:47.843 --> 00:25:49.176
to pay that rate of interest

547
00:25:49.176 --> 00:25:51.353
or you won't lend us the money.

548
00:25:51.353 --> 00:25:56.353
<v ->Typically in an IMF program
there'll be some assumption</v>

549
00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.725
about the way interest rates are gonna go.

550
00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:02.843
<v ->And I remember saying which of you</v>

551
00:26:02.843 --> 00:26:05.629
will go face an American farmer

552
00:26:05.629 --> 00:26:08.172
and tell him that to borrow
something for his farm

553
00:26:08.172 --> 00:26:09.944
he must pay 23 percent?

554
00:26:09.944 --> 00:26:12.100
I said they'd run you out of

555
00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.532
The White House and out of Congress.

556
00:26:14.532 --> 00:26:16.614
That's their business.

557
00:26:16.614 --> 00:26:18.369
We are dealing with your business.

558
00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:20.619
(laughing)

559
00:26:22.039 --> 00:26:24.867
<v ->We use machete to farm.</v>

560
00:26:24.867 --> 00:26:27.950
But the world in general use machine.

561
00:26:30.287 --> 00:26:32.152
So when you check it out.

562
00:26:32.152 --> 00:26:34.902
Can machete compete with machine?

563
00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:40.845
<v ->The farmin' section is
nearly completely wiped out.</v>

564
00:26:42.704 --> 00:26:45.753
<v ->Anything that led to
the more self-reliance</v>

565
00:26:45.753 --> 00:26:48.357
on our resources was strongly discouraged.

566
00:26:48.357 --> 00:26:50.684
Because of this emergent ideology

567
00:26:50.684 --> 00:26:53.229
which we now call globalization.

568
00:26:53.229 --> 00:26:55.828
<v ->My name is Tom Lipetzky,</v>

569
00:26:55.828 --> 00:26:59.143
I'm with the United States Potato Board,

570
00:26:59.143 --> 00:27:03.292
and we represent about
6000 potato producers

571
00:27:03.292 --> 00:27:05.042
in The United States.

572
00:27:05.983 --> 00:27:07.984
One of the markets which we found to be

573
00:27:07.984 --> 00:27:12.467
of very much interest is
right here in Jamaica.

574
00:27:12.467 --> 00:27:15.115
<v ->Get you up here in this rehearsal.</v>

575
00:27:15.115 --> 00:27:16.894
There we go, okay.

576
00:27:16.894 --> 00:27:18.893
Everybody say potato.

577
00:27:18.893 --> 00:27:20.987
<v Group>Potato.</v>

578
00:27:20.987 --> 00:27:22.062
<v ->Jamaican potato.</v>

579
00:27:22.062 --> 00:27:23.399
<v ->Jamaican potato.</v>

580
00:27:23.399 --> 00:27:27.104
<v ->We had offers from
Washington from some guys.</v>

581
00:27:27.104 --> 00:27:28.437
A group of guys.

582
00:27:29.599 --> 00:27:31.868
We asked them what they
wanted to buy from us.

583
00:27:31.868 --> 00:27:33.715
And there wasn't anything
they could buy from us.

584
00:27:33.715 --> 00:27:36.619
They just want to sell us potato seeds.

585
00:27:36.619 --> 00:27:37.899
We are not short of potato seeds.

586
00:27:37.899 --> 00:27:39.244
That is not our problem.

587
00:27:39.244 --> 00:27:40.339
<v ->I'll give you a joke</v>

588
00:27:40.339 --> 00:27:43.647
talk about gettin' goods
in The United States.

589
00:27:43.647 --> 00:27:45.980
I sign a contract to produce

590
00:27:47.013 --> 00:27:51.634
honeydew melon and cherry tomato.

591
00:27:51.634 --> 00:27:53.570
And you know what happen?

592
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.403
Everything I send to the
package, they turn it down.

593
00:27:56.403 --> 00:27:59.263
Say it not reach a standard.

594
00:27:59.263 --> 00:28:01.415
They say don't package good.

595
00:28:01.415 --> 00:28:05.486
The size that we have is not
matchin' with their size.

596
00:28:05.486 --> 00:28:09.779
And the system went one so rotten with me.

597
00:28:09.779 --> 00:28:10.943
Now you know what I did?

598
00:28:10.943 --> 00:28:12.817
Discarded total.

599
00:28:12.817 --> 00:28:14.042
<v Farmer>NAFTA or whatever</v>

600
00:28:14.042 --> 00:28:16.443
they called it free in the press.

601
00:28:16.443 --> 00:28:18.500
They're not free, they
flow like the Mississippi.

602
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.512
It flows in one direction
into the Gulf Of Mexico.

603
00:28:21.512 --> 00:28:23.988
It never goes back up the hill.

604
00:28:23.988 --> 00:28:27.616
And where as the Gulf
Of Mexico can absorb it.

605
00:28:27.616 --> 00:28:30.849
Jamaica can not absorb
the flow from Europe

606
00:28:30.849 --> 00:28:32.415
and from North America.

607
00:28:32.415 --> 00:28:34.082
All coming in on us.

608
00:28:36.552 --> 00:28:39.168
This is our country, our turf.

609
00:28:39.168 --> 00:28:41.783
Gives us back our market.

610
00:28:41.783 --> 00:28:44.700
Don't try to force your idea on us.

611
00:28:46.265 --> 00:28:48.025
<v ->But now we are finding that the thieves</v>

612
00:28:48.025 --> 00:28:50.196
are become more desperate.

613
00:28:50.196 --> 00:28:54.189
As a result now we have as
farmer have to be planning.

614
00:28:54.189 --> 00:28:56.939
And as people see that we use the

615
00:28:58.373 --> 00:29:00.468
kneel and the needle system.

616
00:29:00.468 --> 00:29:04.419
These pegs they having needles.

617
00:29:04.419 --> 00:29:07.880
So when the thief come now to grab,

618
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.088
to grab this and harvest them,

619
00:29:10.088 --> 00:29:12.088
the needle hit the hand.

620
00:29:14.401 --> 00:29:17.047
I have learned from the bible

621
00:29:17.047 --> 00:29:20.527
at 2nd Timothy, chapter
three, and verse one,

622
00:29:20.527 --> 00:29:21.595
that the last day here

623
00:29:21.595 --> 00:29:24.623
would be difficult and hard to deal with.

624
00:29:24.623 --> 00:29:26.738
So I am looking for it to be hard.

625
00:29:26.738 --> 00:29:28.102
And I am seeing it pelting,

626
00:29:28.102 --> 00:29:29.847
we are pushing me right into hard.

627
00:29:29.847 --> 00:29:32.355
But bare in mind the scripture
said hard to deal with.

628
00:29:32.355 --> 00:29:35.081
It is not to say can't deal with.

629
00:29:35.081 --> 00:29:39.248
(African drum music and chanting)

630
00:29:44.151 --> 00:29:46.182
<v ->We do rule under a government.</v>

631
00:29:46.182 --> 00:29:48.121
But the government not seeing

632
00:29:48.121 --> 00:29:50.064
the things through other people.

633
00:29:50.064 --> 00:29:52.132
Are to doing things to other people.

634
00:29:52.132 --> 00:29:55.228
What they are doing between
the American government

635
00:29:55.228 --> 00:29:58.166
and the Jamaican government
is to seal giant hands

636
00:29:58.166 --> 00:30:01.347
and hurt the poorer class
of people more and more.

637
00:30:01.347 --> 00:30:04.568
<v ->But what will it be
through our government still,</v>

638
00:30:04.568 --> 00:30:06.777
is just the money where they want

639
00:30:06.777 --> 00:30:08.736
and do business with a term.

640
00:30:08.736 --> 00:30:10.215
That's really go with the money.

641
00:30:10.215 --> 00:30:12.787
<v ->The terms and conditions
will go with the money.</v>

642
00:30:12.787 --> 00:30:13.894
<v ->It's true the money.</v>

643
00:30:13.894 --> 00:30:16.576
So we are so poor that these rich people

644
00:30:16.576 --> 00:30:18.819
use the money for real.

645
00:30:18.819 --> 00:30:22.569
Just push their money before

646
00:30:22.569 --> 00:30:24.138
like it's a gift.

647
00:30:24.138 --> 00:30:26.396
But really it's a trap.

648
00:30:26.396 --> 00:30:29.313
(roosters crowing)

649
00:30:32.652 --> 00:30:35.152
(cows mooing)

650
00:30:59.184 --> 00:31:00.773
<v ->We have this dairy farm has been going</v>

651
00:31:00.773 --> 00:31:03.208
from in the early '40's.

652
00:31:03.208 --> 00:31:05.848
My father farmed here before me.

653
00:31:05.848 --> 00:31:09.684
'Twas on a continual rise in production.

654
00:31:09.684 --> 00:31:13.024
<v ->The industry flourished
from 18 million liters a year</v>

655
00:31:13.024 --> 00:31:15.562
to over 30.

656
00:31:15.562 --> 00:31:20.562
I think we peaked at around
34 million liters in '91.

657
00:31:21.203 --> 00:31:25.276
<v ->In 1992 the government
entered into an agreement</v>

658
00:31:25.276 --> 00:31:27.714
with the Inter-American Development Bank

659
00:31:27.714 --> 00:31:30.971
for a loan of about 50 million US dollars.

660
00:31:30.971 --> 00:31:35.971
Which was to support
agriculture and manufacturing.

661
00:31:36.017 --> 00:31:38.794
The conditionalities of those were that

662
00:31:38.794 --> 00:31:42.544
we should abandon any
farm of local subsidies

663
00:31:44.674 --> 00:31:48.800
and we should abandon any control

664
00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.800
of the imports of milk powder,
meats, and what have you.

665
00:31:54.586 --> 00:31:59.291
<v ->Almost always when the
IMF is lending to a country,</v>

666
00:31:59.291 --> 00:32:02.431
a developing country,
we'll be making loans,

667
00:32:02.431 --> 00:32:04.674
the World Bank will be making loans

668
00:32:04.674 --> 00:32:06.579
and efforts in the Americas,

669
00:32:06.579 --> 00:32:08.669
the Inter-American Development Bank,

670
00:32:08.669 --> 00:32:11.741
which is a regional
counterpart of the World Bank,

671
00:32:11.741 --> 00:32:13.433
will be making loans.

672
00:32:13.433 --> 00:32:15.570
<v ->See you couldn't get World Bank</v>

673
00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:16.714
unless IMF gave you the bill of health.

674
00:32:16.714 --> 00:32:17.862
And you couldn't get IMF

675
00:32:17.862 --> 00:32:19.457
unless the World Bank
gave you bill of health.

676
00:32:19.457 --> 00:32:20.981
And you couldn't get either unless

677
00:32:20.981 --> 00:32:22.708
the Inter-American Development Bank

678
00:32:22.708 --> 00:32:24.528
gave you a clean bill of health.

679
00:32:24.528 --> 00:32:26.150
Cross conditionality.

680
00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:31.150
That is when they finally had
you by two nooses by the neck.

681
00:32:31.483 --> 00:32:34.614
<v ->Because we were working
together in that country,</v>

682
00:32:34.614 --> 00:32:38.018
we have to make sure we are
not working at cross purposes,

683
00:32:38.018 --> 00:32:41.763
so we will generally agree
on what needs to be done.

684
00:32:41.763 --> 00:32:44.303
<v ->In conjunction with the loan agreement,</v>

685
00:32:44.303 --> 00:32:46.053
and at the same time,

686
00:32:47.583 --> 00:32:51.035
the World Trade Organization signed off

687
00:32:51.035 --> 00:32:56.035
all the member countries into
this new world order of trade.

688
00:32:57.288 --> 00:33:00.838
This new world order
means that there will be

689
00:33:00.838 --> 00:33:05.838
no government regulation in
the trading of any commodities.

690
00:33:06.251 --> 00:33:09.980
<v ->They are telling you that well look,</v>

691
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.839
if we lend you 50 million dollars,

692
00:33:13.839 --> 00:33:18.190
in return you have to lower
all your trade barriers.

693
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:21.439
And you have to compete with us,

694
00:33:21.439 --> 00:33:24.168
on a level playing field.

695
00:33:24.168 --> 00:33:26.359
But that it all double talk.

696
00:33:26.359 --> 00:33:28.584
<v ->It was at this time that the competition</v>

697
00:33:28.584 --> 00:33:32.344
for reconstituted mix
started to get to here.

698
00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:35.018
<v ->We ended up with having
an influx of powder</v>

699
00:33:35.018 --> 00:33:38.559
which destroyed the dairy industry.

700
00:33:38.559 --> 00:33:42.977
Powder became normal
form of milk consumption.

701
00:33:42.977 --> 00:33:47.580
And the dairy industry was
unable to sell their fresh milk.

702
00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.100
<v Reporter>Frank Quarry</v>
says he's been supplying

703
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.862
fresh milk to Century Farm
Products for 15 years.

704
00:33:53.862 --> 00:33:56.490
After last Sunday's
collection he says he was told

705
00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:58.382
that the company had too much milk

706
00:33:58.382 --> 00:34:01.832
and would not collect any
more for an indefinite period.

707
00:34:01.832 --> 00:34:05.986
So on Friday, with no where to
take five days worth of milk,

708
00:34:05.986 --> 00:34:07.986
he had to get rid of it.

709
00:34:09.378 --> 00:34:10.826
<v Dairy Farmer>Dairy</v>
cows has to be milked

710
00:34:10.826 --> 00:34:12.666
twice a day, every day.

711
00:34:12.666 --> 00:34:15.681
365 days a year.

712
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:19.786
So, yesterday and today's
milk, if it's not collected,

713
00:34:19.786 --> 00:34:24.453
you'll have to pull the bar
and let it out in the drain.

714
00:34:27.135 --> 00:34:30.752
<v ->This farm produced
about 3000 imperial quarts</v>

715
00:34:30.752 --> 00:34:32.519
of milk per day.

716
00:34:32.519 --> 00:34:36.848
Right now, down to just
about 600 liters per day.

717
00:34:36.848 --> 00:34:38.269
The animals that were lost

718
00:34:38.269 --> 00:34:42.199
represented a lot of hard
work from a lot of pioneers.

719
00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:43.532
My dad included.

720
00:34:44.453 --> 00:34:48.116
And it obviously was a very,
very difficult decision to make

721
00:34:48.116 --> 00:34:52.060
when we decided to convert
and ground hamburger meat.

722
00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.826
It's incredible, how are we
able to get reconstituted milk

723
00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:58.066
in Jamaica for less than fresh milk?

724
00:34:58.066 --> 00:35:02.461
And it has to be produced at a
greater cost than fresh milk.

725
00:35:02.461 --> 00:35:04.736
It is because it is just
one of a product mix

726
00:35:04.736 --> 00:35:09.700
in countries where they price
some products to carry others.

727
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.887
And it's really just their huge surpluses.

728
00:35:12.887 --> 00:35:16.108
<v ->Certain areas the Americans subsidize</v>

729
00:35:16.108 --> 00:35:20.858
their exported milk powder 137 percent.

730
00:35:23.842 --> 00:35:27.259
Now nobody, nobody can compete with that.

731
00:35:32.751 --> 00:35:34.546
<v Dairy Farmer>The end of day result,</v>

732
00:35:34.546 --> 00:35:37.213
will mean we have no
national food security.

733
00:35:37.213 --> 00:35:41.452
And that when milk powder
finds it's real cost,

734
00:35:41.452 --> 00:35:44.334
where there are no subsidies
in the first world,

735
00:35:44.334 --> 00:35:45.843
in Europe or North America,

736
00:35:45.843 --> 00:35:47.594
it will be more expensive

737
00:35:47.594 --> 00:35:50.683
than the milk that we currently produce.

738
00:35:50.683 --> 00:35:53.088
What do we do in the meanwhile?

739
00:35:53.088 --> 00:35:54.921
We go out of business.

740
00:35:57.208 --> 00:35:58.351
<v ->It is unlikely,</v>

741
00:35:58.351 --> 00:36:01.591
when the milk order gets beyond
the reach of most Jamaicans,

742
00:36:01.591 --> 00:36:06.258
that we will be able to restart
the dairy industry then.

743
00:36:08.387 --> 00:36:11.410
<v ->So between the government
of Jamaica, the IMF,</v>

744
00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:13.941
and the Inter-American Development Bank

745
00:36:13.941 --> 00:36:16.458
we ended up with these policies.

746
00:36:16.458 --> 00:36:18.265
Ultimately I suppose,

747
00:36:18.265 --> 00:36:22.598
our government have been
vision less and weak-kneed.

Jamaica is too beautiful.

759
00:36:54.201 --> 00:36:57.659
Sometimes the beauty of it seems unreal.

760
00:36:57.659 --> 00:36:59.321
Sometimes the beauty of it seems

761
00:36:59.321 --> 00:37:01.880
as if it were stage sets for a play.

762
00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.583

that many shades of blue at once.

No real day could be that
perfectly sunny and bright.

765
00:37:10.653 --> 00:37:12.543

<v ->I actually was born on
a banana farm for years.</v>

801
00:39:01.141 --> 00:39:05.120
And I've been doin' banana
for all these years.

802
00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:09.554
Until (difficult to hear through accent)

803
00:39:09.554 --> 00:39:10.744
effect this industry.

804
00:39:10.744 --> 00:39:14.054
<v ->I've been on the banana
farm in the early '60's.</v>

805
00:39:14.054 --> 00:39:17.609
And ever since then we
are not exporting now

806
00:39:17.609 --> 00:39:20.927
because of the situation
and the way they treat us.

807
00:39:20.927 --> 00:39:22.334
<v ->We produce an export.</v>

808
00:39:22.334 --> 00:39:26.667
And we would love to continue
export to the fullest.

809
00:39:28.145 --> 00:39:30.655
<v ->Jamaica produces at the moment,</v>

810
00:39:30.655 --> 00:39:35.655
in the region of 90
thousand tons of bananas.

811
00:39:37.255 --> 00:39:40.039
All of which go into the UK.

812
00:39:40.039 --> 00:39:43.122
And that is our market.

813
00:39:44.923 --> 00:39:47.995
<v ->Europeans who had colonies in the past</v>

814
00:39:47.995 --> 00:39:51.805
thought it good,

815
00:39:51.805 --> 00:39:53.400
let us put it that way,

816
00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:56.727
that they should help
these colonies to overcome

817
00:39:56.727 --> 00:39:58.809
some of their difficulties
to get them ready

818
00:39:58.809 --> 00:40:02.903
for new technology, to get
them ready for the future.

819
00:40:02.903 --> 00:40:06.752
Under the Lome Agreement,

820
00:40:06.752 --> 00:40:10.408
this is an agreement
between ACP countries,

821
00:40:10.408 --> 00:40:12.641
African, Caribbean, Pacific countries,

822
00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:15.146
with the European Union.

823
00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:17.969
And the ACP countries
enjoyed certain privileges

824
00:40:17.969 --> 00:40:20.610
because of their colonial past.

825
00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:22.657
And these countries in Europe

826
00:40:22.657 --> 00:40:26.216
feel that they should give
back something to the colonies

827
00:40:26.216 --> 00:40:29.847
in order to help them to
take their rightful place

828
00:40:29.847 --> 00:40:30.960
in this world.

829
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.018
As far as the banana trade is concerned,

830
00:40:33.018 --> 00:40:37.351
we have in Europe, a
guaranteed market, tariff free.

831
00:40:40.445 --> 00:40:43.724
<v ->The American's, and
to be brutally frank,</v>

832
00:40:43.724 --> 00:40:47.713
I think it's Mr. Lindner and
his millionaires at Chiquita,

833
00:40:47.713 --> 00:40:52.713
are pressuring the ex-colonial countries

834
00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:56.258
through the WTO.

835
00:40:56.258 --> 00:41:00.736
To get the WTO to agree that
these preferential rates

836
00:41:00.736 --> 00:41:04.736
are unconstitutional and
against the WTO regime.

837
00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:10.213
<v ->The United States don't
produce any bananas.</v>

838
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:16.390
The multi-nationals have
set up their government

839
00:41:19.456 --> 00:41:23.390
to protest at the level of the WTO

840
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:28.190
and affect the lives of a lot of people

841
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:29.940
in the ACP countries.

842
00:41:30.889 --> 00:41:32.205
<v Reporter>And the</v>
worrisome banana issue

843
00:41:32.205 --> 00:41:34.775
and the recent World
Trade Organization ruling,

844
00:41:34.775 --> 00:41:37.042
President Bill Clinton
assured the Caribbean

845
00:41:37.042 --> 00:41:38.401
that his country did not add to

846
00:41:38.401 --> 00:41:40.341
the detriment of the Caribbean.

847
00:41:40.341 --> 00:41:41.595
<v Bill Clinton>Pursuing</v>
and winning our case

848
00:41:41.595 --> 00:41:43.005
at the World Trade Organization,

849
00:41:43.005 --> 00:41:46.398
our target was a
discriminatory European system,

850
00:41:46.398 --> 00:41:48.532
not the Caribbean nations.

851
00:41:48.532 --> 00:41:50.978
I made it clear, that as
we work toward a solution

852
00:41:50.978 --> 00:41:52.341
with our European partners,

853
00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:54.534
we will continue to
support duty free access

854
00:41:54.534 --> 00:41:56.943
for Caribbean bananas
in a European market.

855
00:41:56.943 --> 00:41:58.783
And we will seek ways to promote

856
00:41:58.783 --> 00:42:01.284
diversification of the
Caribbean economies.

857
00:42:01.284 --> 00:42:04.308
<v ->We have no access to
the American market.</v>

858
00:42:04.308 --> 00:42:06.210
The access we have is through Europe.

859
00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:08.105
And through England in particular.

860
00:42:08.105 --> 00:42:10.607
And that is what Chiquita and the US

861
00:42:10.607 --> 00:42:12.841
are trying to kill at this stage.

862
00:42:12.841 --> 00:42:17.580
<v ->Big companies, which are
American owned, Chiquita, Dole,</v>

863
00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:21.344
and they already control 95 percent

864
00:42:21.344 --> 00:42:23.182
of the world market in bananas.

865
00:42:23.182 --> 00:42:26.522
But these companies want the whole hog.

866
00:42:26.522 --> 00:42:28.660
<v ->Chiquita, Dole, Del Monte,</v>

867
00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:32.993
all of these banana is being
grown in Latin America.

868
00:42:34.631 --> 00:42:39.631
Latin America is at
the will of the master.

869
00:42:41.575 --> 00:42:43.852
Who owns these plantations.

870
00:42:43.852 --> 00:42:46.264
<v ->Salaries for the workers are pretty low.</v>

871
00:42:46.264 --> 00:42:48.547
In one instance, I made to understand,

872
00:42:48.547 --> 00:42:50.427
it's one US dollar per day.

873
00:42:50.427 --> 00:42:54.376
And nobody can exist on that sort of rate.

874
00:42:54.376 --> 00:42:55.810
Surely you would be able to produce

875
00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:56.854
cheaper bananas at that rate.

876
00:42:56.854 --> 00:42:58.047
But at what cost?

877
00:42:58.047 --> 00:43:00.381
Socially and morally?

878
00:43:00.381 --> 00:43:05.381
<v Reporter>(speaking</v>
in foreign language)

879
00:43:05.415 --> 00:43:09.115
<v ->Some Chiquita banana
workers went on strike.</v>

880
00:43:09.115 --> 00:43:14.115
They were literally forced to
go back to work with a gun.

881
00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:15.858
23 people were killed.

882
00:43:15.858 --> 00:43:17.525
There are no unions.

883
00:43:22.855 --> 00:43:25.670
<v ->Our bananas cost us more to produce</v>

884
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:28.337
than the South American bananas.

885
00:43:30.103 --> 00:43:32.276
We actually cost us 11 US dollars

886
00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:35.278
to produce 40 pounds of our bananas.

887
00:43:35.278 --> 00:43:39.945
While it cost them 5 US dollars
for that same 40 pounds.

888
00:43:39.945 --> 00:43:43.644
We aren't able to do much of
the price of South American's.

889
00:43:43.644 --> 00:43:46.838
<v ->Well in the past things
was very bright with us.</v>

890
00:43:46.838 --> 00:43:49.314
But in the present right now,

891
00:43:49.314 --> 00:43:54.032
things slowed because the
production gone down very low.

892
00:43:54.032 --> 00:43:58.253
<v ->Two years ago we had about 150 workers.</v>

893
00:43:58.253 --> 00:44:01.437
Today it's about 15 workers on the farm.

894
00:44:01.437 --> 00:44:02.673
My farm in particular,

895
00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:04.266
we have been trying to find investors

896
00:44:04.266 --> 00:44:06.350
to increase our capital,

897
00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:08.412
over the last two or three years.

898
00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:11.508
But especially since
the adverse WTO ruling,

899
00:44:11.508 --> 00:44:13.430
nobody will touch bananas.

900
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:15.195
The banks won't invest in it.

901
00:44:15.195 --> 00:44:17.308
Private investors won't invest in it.

902
00:44:17.308 --> 00:44:19.680
Because the future looks dim.

903
00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:23.881
<v ->In five more years, banana
was up, banana was good.</v>

904
00:44:23.881 --> 00:44:26.260
We could call it green gold in those days.

905
00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:29.745
Because a farmer could export his banana.

906
00:44:29.745 --> 00:44:31.747
He could have a nice building.

907
00:44:31.747 --> 00:44:33.159
He could have a car.

908
00:44:33.159 --> 00:44:38.092
But no, you just living on survival now.

909
00:44:38.092 --> 00:44:40.524
<v ->All we can do we can plant the bananas</v>

910
00:44:40.524 --> 00:44:42.309
because we love to plant.

911
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:43.282
Right?

912
00:44:43.282 --> 00:44:46.451
But we can't sustain our
children on banana anymore.

913
00:44:46.451 --> 00:44:49.070
And that is the reason,
one of the main reason,

914
00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:51.546
finding a young man out on the street now

915
00:44:51.546 --> 00:44:53.205
lootin' and shootin'.

916
00:44:53.205 --> 00:44:56.545
Because his parents
can't help him anymore.

917
00:44:56.545 --> 00:44:58.614
'Cause banana, just banana,

918
00:44:58.614 --> 00:45:02.864
we used to think of to send
our children to school.

919
00:45:06.152 --> 00:45:07.785
<v Banana Farmer>We would</v>
like to have some better things

920
00:45:07.785 --> 00:45:10.548
going for us here than
for us to be cut out

921
00:45:10.548 --> 00:45:14.298
completely out of the

Tomorrow I go for my driving test.

You marvel at the things

You might look at them and think

00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:28.556
they're so relaxed, so laid back,

977
00:47:28.556 --> 00:47:31.099

984
00:47:43.022 --> 00:47:46.879
Every native from every
place is a potential tourist.

985
00:47:46.879 --> 00:47:50.446
And every tourist is a
native of some where.

986
00:47:50.446 --> 00:47:53.565
Every native would like to find a way out.

987
00:47:53.565 --> 00:47:55.906
Every native would like a rest.

988
00:47:55.906 --> 00:47:58.176
Every native would like a tour.

989
00:47:58.176 --> 00:48:01.241
But some natives, most
natives in the world,

990
00:48:01.241 --> 00:48:03.045
can not go anywhere.

991
00:48:03.045 --> 00:48:06.729
They're too poor to escape
the realities of their lives.

992
00:48:06.729 --> 00:48:08.358
And they're too poor to live properly

993
00:48:08.358 --> 00:48:10.390
in the place where they live.

994
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:13.947
Which is the very place that,
you the tourist, want to go.

995
00:48:13.947 --> 00:48:18.349
So when the natives see you,
the tourist, they envy you.

996
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:20.312
They envy your own ability to leave

your own banality and boredom.

998

They envy your ability to turn their own

Try to remain on your feet guys.

1031
00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:55.339
How much do you get per
day out of the workers?

1032
00:49:55.339 --> 00:49:59.052
So all what you get bein' going away.

1033
00:49:59.052 --> 00:50:01.006
And nothing been seen
stayin' in the country.

1034
00:50:01.006 --> 00:50:04.336
So the country been
gettin' poorer and poorer.

1035
00:50:04.336 --> 00:50:06.320
And the people be gettin' more frustrated.

1053
00:50:57.682 --> 00:51:02.182
I would consider it to be
like a state in our country.

Jamaica in the 1980's.</v>

1059
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:30.658
The US government decided on
a Caribbean based initiative.

1060
00:51:30.658 --> 00:51:34.126
With their idea of creating
a lot of employment

1061
00:51:34.126 --> 00:51:36.139
of the lower level basis.

1062
00:51:36.139 --> 00:51:38.366
The Caribbean Development
Bank gives them money,

1063
00:51:38.366 --> 00:51:39.847
the World Bank gives them money,

1064
00:51:39.847 --> 00:51:43.180
in order to build the actual structures.

1065
00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:47.990
The government is paying back the loans

1066
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:49.814
on all the Free Zones.

1067
00:51:49.814 --> 00:51:51.897
This will take some time.

1068
00:51:58.401 --> 00:52:00.790
<v ->All the material for
this production process</v>

1069
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:03.881
come in in trailers
from the United States.

1070
00:52:03.881 --> 00:52:06.222
These materials consist of cutters

1071
00:52:06.222 --> 00:52:10.283
that are cut in the US, made
in the US, and put in bundles.

1072
00:52:10.283 --> 00:52:14.462
This also involves
implantation of elastic,

1073
00:52:14.462 --> 00:52:17.807
and trim, and thread,
and all the components.

1074
00:52:17.807 --> 00:52:22.310
This product is made of 100
percent USA made material

1075
00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:25.075
and we only assemble it in Jamaica.

1076
00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:28.670
<v ->Trade in my tear ups and
take them from my brother</v>

1077
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:31.170
and don't buy them in Jamaica.

1078
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:36.218
Them said they don't want to
spend their money in Jamaica.

1079
00:52:36.218 --> 00:52:39.819
<v ->It was really collars or the sides.</v>

1080
00:52:39.819 --> 00:52:42.837
All you do is shoulder part.

1081
00:52:42.837 --> 00:52:46.253
You must finish about
10 bundle for the day.

1082
00:52:46.253 --> 00:52:47.962
<v ->I was doin' the Tommy Hilfiger.</v>

1083
00:52:47.962 --> 00:52:49.714

<v ->So about Tommy
Hilfigers, Brooks Brothers.</v>

1085
00:52:53.154 --> 00:52:58.154
<v ->Them do like Tommy, Brooks Brothers,</v>

1086
00:53:01.176 --> 00:53:06.176
Earth Childs, and Marc Alexander Sports.

1087
00:53:06.689 --> 00:53:08.841
<v ->I don't know how much
them really get for a shirt.</v>

1088
00:53:08.841 --> 00:53:12.167
But I hear that them get a good amount.

1089
00:53:12.167 --> 00:53:14.101
When I was first employed,

1090
00:53:14.101 --> 00:53:16.861
I heard that we were to
get the money in the US.

1091
00:53:16.861 --> 00:53:18.233
But the government said no.

1092
00:53:18.233 --> 00:53:21.987
They must change it all time
and give it us in Jamaican.

1093
00:53:21.987 --> 00:53:24.746
Because they need the US.

1094
00:53:24.746 --> 00:53:26.576
The country need the US.

1095
00:53:26.576 --> 00:53:29.129
<v ->They're able to come
in for a number of years,</v>

1096
00:53:29.129 --> 00:53:31.299
without payin' certain taxes.

1097
00:53:31.299 --> 00:53:36.299
<v ->The Free Zone operates
in the theoretical theme</v>

1098
00:53:36.306 --> 00:53:39.070
that it's not even part of Jamaica.

1099
00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:42.404
It is a separate entity.

1100
00:53:42.404 --> 00:53:45.271
So the goods come in in a container.

1101
00:53:45.271 --> 00:53:47.766
And go through guarded gates.

1102
00:53:47.766 --> 00:53:52.263
After it leaves the Free Zone
it goes back on to the ship.

1103
00:53:52.263 --> 00:53:57.263
Never in effect having
touched the shores of Jamaica.

1104
00:53:57.393 --> 00:54:01.621
So those factories are not
liable to local controls.

1105
00:54:01.621 --> 00:54:04.107
They're not liable to
things like income tax,

1106
00:54:04.107 --> 00:54:07.746
or certain duties, taxes,
anything like that.

1107
00:54:07.746 --> 00:54:10.831
The Free Zone is to give
the opportunity of people

1108
00:54:10.831 --> 00:54:15.450
to operate without the controls,
or the laws, or the systems

1109
00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:19.033
that normally govern
a countries operation.

1110
00:54:20.497 --> 00:54:23.175
<v ->If you get the collar to
sew, you have to sew the 600,</v>

1111
00:54:23.175 --> 00:54:25.024
if you don't sew the 600

1112
00:54:25.024 --> 00:54:28.002

<v ->And when you look at that,</v>

1124
00:55:02.879 --> 00:55:04.848
actually there's no where in the US,

1125

00:55:20.791 --> 00:55:25.791
NIS, NHT, for the health insurance.

it was just takin' that money.

it seemed like a ticking bomb

00:57:08.933 --> 00:57:11.482
finally saw a chance to explode.

who started coming in
from earlier this month,

<v ->Them don't object to nothing.</v>

influx of foreign workers?

1189
00:57:51.031 --> 00:57:52.451
When the great Free Zone promise

1190
00:57:52.451 --> 00:57:55.864
was to elevate those very
same unemployment problems?

1191
00:57:55.864 --> 00:57:57.249
<v ->Obviously we are trying to provide</v>

employment for Jamaicans, not Asians.

1193
00:58:00.218 --> 00:58:02.919
They claimed that they couldn't
get the people in Jamaica

1194
00:58:02.919 --> 00:58:07.002
with a skill level that
they needed for that job.

1195
00:58:07.971 --> 00:58:10.583
<v ->If the government asked
them to give us more probably</v>

1196
00:58:10.583 --> 00:58:13.753
they will close down the
factories and go to Mexico.

1197
00:58:13.753 --> 00:58:15.793
Because most of them gone to Mexico.

1198
00:58:15.793 --> 00:58:18.384
Because them say they are cheaper labor.

1199
00:58:18.384 --> 00:58:19.217
<v ->You know these companies</v>

1200
00:58:19.217 --> 00:58:21.158
are very aggressive to make profits.

1201
00:58:21.158 --> 00:58:24.147
And they are accountable
to their shareholders.

1202
00:58:24.147 --> 00:58:26.073
So they basically just went.

1203
00:58:26.073 --> 00:58:29.559
You know, they're in a
position to move the production

1204
00:58:29.559 --> 00:58:32.173
to areas that are you
know, cheaper for them.

1205

<v ->I worked there for 15 years</v>

1206
00:58:35.822 --> 00:58:38.231
and they fired me for low production.

1207
00:58:38.231 --> 00:58:40.226
Say I'm not doing enough.

1208
00:58:40.226 --> 00:58:43.451

closing temporarily for restructuring.

had dismantled and sold
the factory equipment.

1224

And packed their bags in
preparation for a hasty departure.

The factory will not reopen tomorrow

00:59:33.028 --> 00:59:36.945
and the majority of
workers have not been paid.

1227
00:59:39.134 --> 00:59:41.473
<v ->The government did the

international agencies like
the IMF and the World Bank.

1229
00:59:45.045 --> 00:59:47.955
That's the thing of the loans.

1230
00:59:47.955 --> 00:59:51.531
<v ->Loan makers know paying out
52 cents out of every dollar</v>

1231
00:59:51.531 --> 00:59:54.581
that it collects in
interest payment on debt,

1232
00:59:54.581 --> 00:59:58.726
that leaves 48 cents
to do everything else.

1233
00:59:58.726 --> 01:00:01.575
<v ->The interesting thing is
that even though the loans</v>

1234
01:00:01.575 --> 01:00:05.503
are being paid back now
at the high interest rate

1235
01:00:05.503 --> 01:00:07.411
because of the exchange rate,

1236
01:00:07.411 --> 01:00:11.779
more factories are closing, and
more people are out of jobs.

1237
01:00:11.779 --> 01:00:13.158
So I don't see the purpose,

the real purpose has not been made.

1239

<v ->I better them close down the zone,</v>

1241
01:00:21.426 --> 01:00:24.844
make we organize something for our selves,

<v ->The question of where
is the power in the IMF.</v>

1268
01:01:38.964 --> 01:01:42.634
First the votes of each
country are in proportion

1269
01:01:42.634 --> 01:01:45.937
roughly to it's size in the world economy.

1270
01:01:45.937 --> 01:01:50.937
So US has just over
17.5 percent of the vote

1271
01:01:51.973 --> 01:01:54.063
because it's the biggest
economy in the world.

1272
01:01:54.063 --> 01:01:57.653
Japan has the second most
votes and Germany the third.

1273
01:01:57.653 --> 01:02:02.186
So in that sense the US is by
far the biggest single voice.

1274
01:02:02.186 --> 01:02:05.857
<v ->To change anything in IMF you
need 80 percent of the vote.</v>

1275
01:02:05.857 --> 01:02:09.749
And I think the United States
and Western European countries

1276
01:02:09.749 --> 01:02:11.784
control more than 80 percent of the vote.

1277
01:02:11.784 --> 01:02:13.853
Which means you can't
change anything in IMF

1278
01:02:13.853 --> 01:02:16.641
unless you get their approval.

01:03:32.474 --> 01:03:35.327
but the IMF and the World Bank.

1303
01:03:35.327 --> 01:03:39.099
They're already powerful enough
and get into our systems.

1304
01:03:39.099 --> 01:03:41.315
I think in dealing with people like

1305
01:03:41.315 --> 01:03:43.358
the IMF and the World Bank

1306
01:03:43.358 --> 01:03:46.839
it's important that you
do your homework so well.

1307
01:03:46.839 --> 01:03:48.758
That you don't take to them a plan

1308
01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:51.277
where they dictate to you what to do.

1309

<v ->They were not created

on the economy exclusion of the people

1316
01:04:13.626 --> 01:04:15.801
you will just collect money to pay

they may have good will, quote unquote,

1325

but the results are telling so many others

1326
01:04:35.693 --> 01:04:38.152
that it's not what we have.

1327
01:04:38.152 --> 01:04:41.376
As a matter of fact, why do we have today

1328
01:04:41.376 --> 01:04:44.290
1.3 billion people in the world

1329
01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:47.767
living with less than one dollar a day?

1330
01:04:47.767 --> 01:04:49.961
<v ->Those who control others</v>

1331
01:04:49.961 --> 01:04:53.701
have no interest in whether
you are self-sustaining.

1332
01:04:53.701 --> 01:04:56.400
They are doing their work.

1333
01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.227
Their duty.

1334
01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:00.162
If the pressures that they put

1335
01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:04.988
force you to a greater
dependence on foreign capital.

1336
01:05:04.988 --> 01:05:07.800
So you see it's not as
simple as capital coming in.

1337
01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:09.645
What kind of capital?

1338
01:05:09.645 --> 01:05:14.312
And does the capital help you
to become self-sustaining?

1339
01:05:15.647 --> 01:05:18.661
<v ->That dollars could be
used in so many products</v>

1340
01:05:18.661 --> 01:05:20.152
grown in Jamaica.

1341
01:05:20.152 --> 01:05:24.788
Like Irish potatoes, and
seasoning, and vegetables.

1342
01:05:24.788 --> 01:05:28.337
In other words, what they do
is import all these things.

1343
01:05:28.337 --> 01:05:29.846
<v ->So that is all them stronger.</v>

1344
01:05:29.846 --> 01:05:31.630
The small governments.

1345
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:33.930
Come in and let them buildin'.

1346
01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:37.763
But we're breakin' down
without them buildin'.

1347
01:05:39.946 --> 01:05:41.485
<v ->The case was very important</v>

1348
01:05:41.485 --> 01:05:44.004
because it was the first case in Jamaica

1349
01:05:44.004 --> 01:05:47.567
dealing with the effect of globalization

1350
01:05:47.567 --> 01:05:49.558
in that commercial respect.

1351
01:05:49.558 --> 01:05:52.443
US McDonald's claimed
that Jamaican company

1352
01:05:52.443 --> 01:05:55.048
was passing off it's business as theirs.

1353
01:05:55.048 --> 01:05:56.450
By using the name McDonald's

1354
01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:57.935
they would cause people to think

1355
01:05:57.935 --> 01:06:00.602
that they were really a
branch of the US company.

1356
01:06:00.602 --> 01:06:03.171
And the Jamaican company insisted
that they were here first.

1357
01:06:03.171 --> 01:06:05.791
And had been here for over
20 years using the name.

1358
01:06:05.791 --> 01:06:09.863
The US company claimed that
by opening offices here

1359
01:06:09.863 --> 01:06:11.342
that they would provide employment,

1360
01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:14.872
they would purchase
stock and raw materials

1361
01:06:14.872 --> 01:06:16.493
from local producers,

1362
01:06:16.493 --> 01:06:18.855
and they would be able
to help the economy.

1363
01:06:18.855 --> 01:06:20.898
They placed great emphasis on the size

1364
01:06:20.898 --> 01:06:22.485
our their advertising budget.

1365
01:06:22.485 --> 01:06:23.877
They spent millions of dollars world-wide

1366
01:06:23.877 --> 01:06:25.691
promoting the name.

1367
01:06:25.691 --> 01:06:28.995
And they argued that that gave them,

1368
01:06:28.995 --> 01:06:32.428
in all countries that
received US satellite TV,

1369
01:06:32.428 --> 01:06:34.973
that had US magazines on sale,

1370
01:06:34.973 --> 01:06:37.545
people in that country
would necessarily know

1371
01:06:37.545 --> 01:06:41.308
about McDonald's and associate
the name with that company.

1372
01:06:41.308 --> 01:06:43.369
The simple aspect was that the nature

1373
01:06:43.369 --> 01:06:46.716
of the Jamaican operation was
such as to confuse no one.

1374
01:06:46.716 --> 01:06:49.154
<v ->On today's menu we have curry goat,</v>

1375
01:06:49.154 --> 01:06:52.756

1376
01:06:52.756 --> 01:06:55.083
<v Attorney>They sold to a large extent</v>

1377
01:06:55.083 --> 01:06:56.968
traditional Jamaican fare.

1378
01:06:56.968 --> 01:06:59.917
The judge refused to close
down the Jamaican company.

1379
01:06:59.917 --> 01:07:01.600
And that did create some pressure

1380
01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.088
because Chamber of
Commerce and similar people

1381
01:07:04.088 --> 01:07:07.368
were calling us to say
you're keeping out business

1382
01:07:07.368 --> 01:07:09.497
and your preventing the
development of the economy.

1383
01:07:09.497 --> 01:07:10.684
<v ->It's a question of what's fair</v>

1384
01:07:10.684 --> 01:07:12.627
for the citizens of that country.

1385
01:07:12.627 --> 01:07:16.453
If they're working, and
they're manufacturing,

1386
01:07:16.453 --> 01:07:17.662
and they're producing,

1387
01:07:17.662 --> 01:07:20.330
why shouldn't they have
the right to buy things

1388
01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:23.185
that other people have
in the rest of the world?

<v ->You know there was Burger
King, and Kentucky Fried,</v>

1390
01:07:25.659 --> 01:07:28.934

1391
01:07:28.934 --> 01:07:31.908
of mass consumption in American Society.

1392
01:07:31.908 --> 01:07:35.714
In a society that does
not have a productive base

1393
01:07:35.714 --> 01:07:37.864

1394
01:07:37.864 --> 01:07:41.743
<v ->McDonald's started talking
to us about three years ago.</v>

1395
01:07:41.743 --> 01:07:45.047
This facility, which cost
us 40 millions to upgrade,

1396
01:07:45.047 --> 01:07:49.603
was put in place to facilitate people

1397
01:07:49.603 --> 01:07:52.344
like McDonald's and Burger King.

1398
01:07:52.344 --> 01:07:55.604
Increase our production and make factories

1399
01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:58.030
that they wouldn't have
to be importin' them.

1400
01:07:58.030 --> 01:08:02.281
McDonald's have asked us to
supply them with a faster plan.

1401
01:08:02.281 --> 01:08:03.526
We have done that.

1402
01:08:03.526 --> 01:08:05.350
We have made burgers for them

1403
01:08:05.350 --> 01:08:07.777
which they have sampled
and found to be okay.

1404
01:08:07.777 --> 01:08:09.761
In fact, the taste has been much better

1405
01:08:09.761 --> 01:08:12.426
than the ones they had imported.

1406
01:08:12.426 --> 01:08:16.343
But we still have not
been able to supply them.

1407

<v ->Beef farmers from several parishes,</v>

1410
01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:25.733

1411
01:08:25.733 --> 01:08:27.793
fast food giant McDonald's.

Until last year.

1416
01:08:38.594 --> 01:08:42.093
Although these animals have
been sold from December.

1417
01:08:42.093 --> 01:08:43.862
We just can't sell them.

1418
01:08:43.862 --> 01:08:46.233
In America you wouldn't find cows

1419
01:08:46.233 --> 01:08:47.720
grazin' their pasture like this.

1420
01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:52.287
They are injected with anabolic
steroid know as Stilbestrol.

1421
01:08:52.287 --> 01:08:53.839
We can't use Stilbestrol here.

1422
01:08:53.839 --> 01:08:55.178
Just doesn't come into the country.

1423
01:08:55.178 --> 01:08:58.124
But it's being used on farms abroad.

1424
01:08:58.124 --> 01:09:01.611
So when the people are
consumin' imported beef,

1425
01:09:01.611 --> 01:09:03.240
they are really exposin' themselves

1426
01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.323
to cancer causin' agents.

1427
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:11.275
<v ->We had a case where one
of the local businessman</v>

1428
01:09:11.275 --> 01:09:13.469
thought it'd be a good deal if he could

1429
01:09:13.469 --> 01:09:16.083
buy some chicken cheap.

1430
01:09:16.083 --> 01:09:17.921
And they came up with an idea

1431
01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:20.714
that they would import some chicken.

1432
01:09:20.714 --> 01:09:22.274
This chicken it turns out,

1433
01:09:22.274 --> 01:09:27.274
upon examination was I
think about 20 years old.

1434
01:09:27.606 --> 01:09:28.942
When we determined that

1435
01:09:28.942 --> 01:09:32.129
yes it was not for human consumption,

1436
01:09:32.129 --> 01:09:35.487
he tried to convince us that the shipment

1437
01:09:35.487 --> 01:09:37.924
only came here accidentally.

1438
01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:40.565
And that the shipment
was in fact for Haiti.

1439
01:09:40.565 --> 01:09:43.681
And that we should release
it back into his custody

1440
01:09:43.681 --> 01:09:46.348
so he could send it on to Haiti.

1441
01:09:52.342 --> 01:09:54.282
<v ->I been in America.</v>

1442
01:09:54.282 --> 01:09:56.399
I never seen no where in a store

1443
01:09:56.399 --> 01:09:58.673
where them sell chicken back.

1444
01:09:58.673 --> 01:10:01.859
But yet I see leave America
and come to Jamaica.

1445
01:10:01.859 --> 01:10:03.186
<v ->Well it's from slavery.</v>

1446
01:10:03.186 --> 01:10:05.363
And remember slavery was that

1447
01:10:05.363 --> 01:10:09.662
the master would eat what
he consider the better part

1448
01:10:09.662 --> 01:10:13.154
and then the slaves would get the refuse.

1449
01:10:13.154 --> 01:10:16.001
So the back, and the neck, and tail,

1450
01:10:16.001 --> 01:10:18.384
and the foot, and all these things,

1451
01:10:18.384 --> 01:10:22.730
is like a third world
country dumpin' ground.

1452
01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:25.313
(man chanting)

1453
01:10:34.527 --> 01:10:37.452
<v ->A very interesting thing
in the US poultry market</v>

1454
01:10:37.452 --> 01:10:40.892
has been the development of
the passion for white meat.

1455
01:10:40.892 --> 01:10:44.154
Obviously, if you take the
breast meat off of the chicken,

1456
01:10:44.154 --> 01:10:45.606
you're left with the dark meat.

1457
01:10:45.606 --> 01:10:48.072
The leg, and the thigh,
and the neck, and the back.

1458
01:10:48.072 --> 01:10:51.116
As a consequence there is more
and more of the dark meat.

1459
01:10:51.116 --> 01:10:53.380
Which is imported from the
United States of America.

1460
01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:54.647
And that has really been the threat

1461
01:10:54.647 --> 01:10:56.883
to our market at this point.

1462
01:10:56.883 --> 01:10:59.584
When the cost of producing a
pound of breast chicken meat

1463
01:10:59.584 --> 01:11:02.395
in the states is very
likely about 50 cents,

1464
01:11:02.395 --> 01:11:06.395
it was being offered to Jamaica
as low as 20 cents a pound.

1465
01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:09.176
This had a traumatic affect in terms of

1466
01:11:09.176 --> 01:11:12.323
our local industry and
our ability to compete.

1467
01:11:12.323 --> 01:11:15.150
There's no doubt that
the markets in our region

1468
01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:17.857
are being targeted by the US industry

1469
01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:20.900
in terms of penetrating
and supplying those markets

1470
01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:24.861
at the detriment to the local industry

1471
01:11:24.861 --> 01:11:26.732
and the possible loss of jobs.

1472
01:11:26.732 --> 01:11:29.183
<v ->The labor dispute involving
management and workers</v>

1473
01:11:29.183 --> 01:11:30.651
who were made redundant at the

1474
01:11:30.651 --> 01:11:33.450
Jamaica Boiler Spring Village
Plant in St. Catherine

1475
01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:35.356
turned nasty today.

1476
01:11:35.356 --> 01:11:36.625
Over 200 chicken farmers,

1477
01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:38.093
who've been suffering losses

1478
01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:39.632
since the shut down of the plant,

1479
01:11:39.632 --> 01:11:41.796
protested to bring
attention to their plight.

1480
01:11:41.796 --> 01:11:44.787
Former workers demonstrating
outside the plant

1481
01:11:44.787 --> 01:11:48.265
clashed with the police,
resulting in an all out brawl,

1482
01:11:48.265 --> 01:11:50.802
in which a number of persons were injured

1483
01:11:50.802 --> 01:11:53.942
and a vehicle belonging
to the plant set on fire.

1484
01:11:53.942 --> 01:11:57.084
Mr. Wildish noted several
initiatives had been taken,

1485
01:11:57.084 --> 01:12:01.116
without success, to achieve
international competitiveness.

1486
01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:05.284
<v ->We're told that we've got
to find areas we can compete.</v>

1487
01:12:05.284 --> 01:12:06.791
And we say what?

1488
01:12:06.791 --> 01:12:08.583
What are these niche markets

1489
01:12:08.583 --> 01:12:10.520
that we're meant to be going after?

1490
01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.660
They tell us well peppers,
and spices, and these things.

1491
01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:15.388
You should be able to
grow those efficiently.

1492
01:12:15.388 --> 01:12:17.067
And you do have tourism.

1493
01:12:17.067 --> 01:12:19.006
<v ->Karen, you are runnin' the white.</v>

1494
01:12:19.006 --> 01:12:20.835
Glen, you are runnin' the green crab.

1495
01:12:20.835 --> 01:12:23.113
And Robin, you are runnin' the yellow.

1496
01:12:23.113 --> 01:12:26.004
So on the count of three we're
gonna set the crabs free.

1497
01:12:26.004 --> 01:12:27.543
Remember no sudden movements.

1498
01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:28.876
One, two, three.

1499
01:12:29.723 --> 01:12:31.856
Alright, everybody is off.

1500
01:12:31.856 --> 01:12:33.682
But the red is in the lead now.

1501
01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:35.313
Just by two crab lengths.

1502
01:12:35.313 --> 01:12:37.059
And it could be stopped in the middle.

1503
01:12:37.059 --> 01:12:38.558
The yellow hasn't moved up 'til now.

1504
01:12:38.558 --> 01:12:40.134
We don't know what's happenin' with him.

1505
01:12:40.134 --> 01:12:43.803
The white has now taken over the lead.

1506
01:12:43.803 --> 01:12:45.172
The green is still on.

1507
01:12:45.172 --> 01:12:46.005
(laughing)

1508
01:12:46.005 --> 01:12:47.780
The green is still on the goal.

1509
01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.324
Patricia is coachin' her crab.

1510
01:12:49.324 --> 01:12:51.807
So the white crab is
the winner of that race.

1511
01:12:51.807 --> 01:12:56.107
<v DJ>Up to you to tell us</v>
who you think has the best tan.

1512
01:12:56.107 --> 01:12:58.706
We can see Scott is well tan.

1513
01:12:58.706 --> 01:13:03.706
So Tim can turn around so that
everybody can see your tan.

It's interesting.

01:15:49.285 --> 01:15:51.341
Incidentally there is an IMF program

1565
01:15:51.341 --> 01:15:53.243
with Jamaica at the moment.

1566

We're not lending them money

1567
01:15:54.547 --> 01:15:57.870
but we have what's called
a staff monitored program.

<v ->We don't have an IMF agreement,</v>

1569
01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:04.706
we are following what IMF
would have wanted us to do

1570
01:16:04.706 --> 01:16:06.506
on an agreement anyway.

1571
01:16:06.506 --> 01:16:09.113
So that influence of IMF

We're not gettin' any IMF money,

there are violent protests

1576
01:16:23.698 --> 01:16:26.201
over higher prices and
fuel prices in Jamaica.

1577
01:16:26.201 --> 01:16:27.969
<v Reporter>As many as six</v>
people have been reported killed

1578
01:16:27.969 --> 01:16:32.308
in the unrest that is sweeping
across that Caribbean Island.

1579
01:16:32.308 --> 01:16:34.495
It escalated in the past 24 hours.

An 18 year old dead at this home.

1581
01:16:36.822 --> 01:16:40.750
The jump in the gas tax is hard
in a country with many poor.

1582
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:44.570
The Government Defensive is a
way to pay for bank failures.

1583
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:48.585
But now suggests there may
be room for compromise.

You're just constantly,

it's like you're just living

So you can imagine that with them

1607
01:19:07.789 --> 01:19:10.042
eventually had to go to them and

1608
01:19:10.042 --> 01:19:12.733
eventually have to sign
an agreement with them.

1609
01:19:12.733 --> 01:19:14.861
It was really one of the bitter,

1610
01:19:14.861 --> 01:19:18.336
traumatic experiences of my public life.

1611

(soft flute music)

1612
01:19:30.226 --> 01:19:31.103
<v Narrator>Jamaica was discovered</v>

1613
01:19:31.103 --> 01:19:34.123
by Christopher Colombus in 1493.

1614
01:19:34.123 --> 01:19:36.631
Not too long after it was settled

1615
01:19:36.631 --> 01:19:38.763
by human rubbish from Europe.

1616
01:19:38.763 --> 01:19:41.972
Who used enslaved, but noble
and exulted human beings

1617
01:19:41.972 --> 01:19:46.722
from Africa to satisfy their
desire for wealth and power.

1618
01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:50.179
Eventually the masters left,

1619
01:19:50.179 --> 01:19:52.120
in a kind of way.

1620
01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.654
Eventually the slaves were freed,

1621
01:19:54.654 --> 01:19:56.071
in a kind of way.

1622
01:19:57.791 --> 01:20:00.291

So too with the slaves.

That he will not desert us.

that he created in his image.

1643
01:21:12.295 --> 01:21:15.009
We must look deep within ourselves,

into the depth of our souls.

1645

<v ->The economic basical for
us doing this plantation</v>

1659
01:22:22.985 --> 01:22:26.601
is to suffice people who
can not buy the cello

and other things for lower
price than we doing it.

1661
01:22:30.257 --> 01:22:31.831
We're trying to make ourselves

1662
01:22:31.831 --> 01:22:34.655
self-reliant and self-production.

1663
01:22:34.655 --> 01:22:37.030
Like we're planting cello lettuce.

1664
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:41.080
We want onion, beets,
carrot, and other protein.

1665
01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:42.873
But the land is to small for us

1666
01:22:42.873 --> 01:22:46.585
and we are forceful people who
will put out the production.

1667
01:22:46.585 --> 01:22:49.797
And in the country, if the
government look for people,

1668
01:22:49.797 --> 01:22:53.126
like forceful people like us
who will put out production,

1669
01:22:53.126 --> 01:22:57.095
we can have our own thing
to supply our own country.
