WEBVTT

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Narrator:
 THEY'RE SWEET.
 THEY'RE SOCIAL.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
THEY'RE SO NICE.
 THEY'RE GIRLS.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
AM I DEAD YET?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
BUT GROWING UP GIRL
 ISN'T ALL THAT IT SEEMS.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
THEY WILL PLAY SOMETIMES
OR HAVE THAT FEMININE SIDE.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
BUT THEY HAVE A STATEMENT.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Narrator:
 TODAY NEW INSIGHTS
 INTO OUR DAUGHTERS...

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
WE KNOW LITTLE GIRLS
WHO FEEL THAT THEY HAVE

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
AN AFTER-SCHOOL JOB,
FOR EXAMPLE,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
ARE MUCH LESS PRONE
TO EARLY PREGNANCY.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
...AND OURSELVES.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
SHOULD I DO TOUGH LOVE AND SAY,
"STOP CRYING, GET OVER THIS?"

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
- Narrator:
  BRAZELTON ON PARENTING.
-I WOULDN'T DO IT.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
( theme music playing )

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
IN RECENT YEARS, SCIENCE
HAS MADE REMARKABLE DISCOVERIES

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
ABOUT THE LINK
BETWEEN SEX AND BEHAVIOR.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
AND NOWHERE HAS THIS
BEEN MORE STRIKING

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
THAN IN UNDERSTANDING GIRLS.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT
AS EARLY AS A FEW MONTHS,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
GIRLS AND BOYS SHOW
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
WHEN IT COMES TO REACTING
TO THEIR PARENTS.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
AND AS GIRLS GROW,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
THE DIFFERENCES BECOME
MORE DISTINCT.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
WHY IS THIS SO,
AND WHAT PART

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
DOES BIOLOGY
VERSUS SOCIETY PLAY?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
WE'RE GOING TO EXAMINE
THESE QUESTIONS AND MORE

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
AS WE EXPLORE
THE SPECIAL WORLD OF GIRLS.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
WE GOT CLOSER
TO TWO-FIFTHS,
TWO-THIRDS--

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Brazelton:
 A TYPICAL FOURTH-GRADE
 CLASSROOM,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
AND A PERFECT LABORATORY
 FOR OUR STUDIES.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
- THIS ONE WAS SO EASY.
 WE HAD IN LIKE TWO SECONDS.
- I KNOW.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
THESE GIRLS ARE
 9 AND 10 YEARS OLD,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
AN AGE OF TRANSITION
 FROM CHILD TO ADOLESCENCE.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
OH, MY GOSH!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
IT'S AN AGE WHEN STEREOTYPES
 CAN REALLY BE TESTED.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
AND THE FIRST:
 THE BRAIN ITSELF.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
THIS PIECE, I KNOW--

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Jennifer Colucci:
 STEREOTYPICALLY, BOYS
 ARE PERCEIVED TO BE STRONGER

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
IN THE MATH
 AND SCIENCE AREAS...

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I TOLD YOU
I KNEW HOW TO DO IT!

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Colucci:
 ...WHERE GIRLS ARE
 PERCEIVED TO BE STRONGER

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
IN READING
 AND LANGUAGE ARTS AREAS.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
"THE CHILDREN FELT AS IF THEY
HAD LEFT THEIR INSIDES BEHIND."

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Brazelton:
 GIRLS DO TEND TO VERBALIZE MORE
 IN PROBLEM-SOLVING PLAY,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
AND, STRIKINGLY, THEY HAVE
 SHARPER HEARING THAN BOYS,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
WHICH MAY BE NATURE'S WAY
 TO HELP WITH COMMUNICATION.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
BUT SCIENCE HAS FOUND
 NO OTHER

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
GENETIC PREDISPOSITION
 TO WORDS VERSUS NUMBERS.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
JUST USING FIFTHS HERE...

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Colucci:
 IN MY EXPERIENCE,
 I HAVE SEEN GIRLS EXCEL

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
IN ALL AREAS
 OF THE CURRICULUM.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I HAVE GIRLS THAT ARE
SCIENTIFIC AND METICULOUS
IN THEIR CALCULATIONS

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
AND EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE
PROBLEM-SOLVERS

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
WHO CONTINUALLY CHALLENGE
 AND MOTIVATE THEMSELVES.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I HAVE
A SPELLING TEST.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Brazelton:
 AND HOW ABOUT PERSONALITY?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
ONE EIGHTY-TWO.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Colucci:
 IN CLASSROOMS,
 GIRLS ARE PERCEIVED TO BE,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
UM, PASSIVE, AND A FLURRY
 OF BOYS' HANDS,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I GUESS,
 IS THE STEREOTYPIC IMAGE

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
OF THE TRADITIONAL
 CLASSROOM.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Brazelton:
 IT'S CLEAR THAT HIGHER
 TESTOSTERONE LEVELS

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
INCREASE COMPETITIVENESS,
 BUT HERE,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
A SIMPLE SOLUTION CAN LEVEL
 THE PLAYING FIELD.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
"MYTH" IS A GOOD WORD,
OF BOYS RAISING HANDS

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
MORE FREQUENTLY THAN GIRLS.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
IT HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT
OVER THE LAST DECADE.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
THERE'S A TERM
 CALLED "WAIT TIME,"

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
AND OUR TEACHERS ARE TRAINED
 TO GIVE AT LEAST SIX SECONDS

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
FOR EVERY QUESTION,
 AND THEN TO CALL ON STUDENTS.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
AND IF WE TRY TO CALL
 ON ALL CHILDREN EQUALLY,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
GIVE ALL CHILDREN AN OPPORTUNITY
IN WHICH TO SHINE,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
THAT STEREOTYPE
SHOULD NOT BE THERE.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
( shouting, laughing )

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Brazelton:
 SPEAKING OF PLAYING,
 RESEARCH HAS SHOWN

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
THAT BOYS AND GIRLS HAVE
 DISTINCT PLAY PATTERNS--

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
BOYS MORE COMPETITIVE,
 GIRLS MORE COOPERATIVE.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
BUT WHEN
 YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER--

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Michael Cavallaro:
 ONE TIME, MAYBE WHEN
 THE GIRLS ARE GROWIN' UP,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
THE PARENTS ARE TRYING TO GET
 THEM TO BE LESS COMPETITIVE,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
AND THEY'RE LED TO BELIEVE
 THEY'RE NOT AS GOOD AS BOYS,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
BUT AS A P.E. TEACHER,
I SEE, AT THIS AGE,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
A LOT OF THE GIRLS ARE
JUST AS GOOD AS THE BOYS.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
WE JUST FINISHED
PHYSICAL FITNESS TESTING.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THE TOP, UH, PERSON

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
DOIN' PULL-UPS
WAS A GIRL.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Brazelton:
 THAT DOES CHANGE
 BECAUSE THEIR BODIES CHANGE.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
BUT WHEN YOU GIVE
 THEM A CHANCE,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
WHAT ABOUT
 BEYOND THE BODY?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Cavallaro:
 NOW WE HAVE CO-ED CLASSES.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
THEY HAVE GREATER OPPORTUNITIES
 TO PLAY SPORTS,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
AND THE GIRLS ARE GETTING
 GREATER CONFIDENCE

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
IN THEMSELVES
 BY PLAYIN' SPORTS.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
YOU KNOW,
 THEY'RE NOT AFRAID TO RUN.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
THEY'RE MORE COMPETITIVE THAN
 THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Kelly's mom:
 THE GIRLS WANNA BE OUT THERE.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
THEY WANNA SAY, "THIS IS ME.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I'M A FORCE
 TO BE RECKONED WITH."

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
IT'S, LIKE, ENCOURAGING.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
THE GIRLS ARE READY
TO TAKE IT ON AND, YOU KNOW--

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
AND, YOU KNOW, THEY DO--
THEY WILL PLAY, SOMETIMES,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
OR, YOU KNOW,
HAVE THAT FEMININE SIDE.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
BUT THEY HAVE
A STATEMENT.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
AT LEAST,
 MY DAUGHTER SEEMS TO.
 ( chuckles )

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
( giggling )

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Brazelton:
 GIRLS AND BOYS
 BOTH GENERALLY TEND

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
TO SOCIALIZE
 WITH THEIR OWN--

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
UNTIL PUBERTY,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
WHEN IT'S
 A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Kelly's mom:
 UP TO LAST YEAR, KELLY WAS

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
ON AN EVEN PLANE, LIKE
 IT DIDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
WHETHER YOU WERE
 A GIRL OR A BOY.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I'M GONNA COMPETE WITH YOU.
 EVERYTHING WAS EQUAL.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
THERE WASN'T REALLY, UH,
 SEX INVOLVED WITH IT.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
BUT NOW THIS YEAR
I SEE A LITTLE BIT OF
THE INTERACTION STARTING.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT
 OF THE LIKING

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
AND BE AWARE OF,
 "THEY ARE THE OPPOSITE SEX."

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
THEY WANNA FLIRT.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
THEY WANNA SAY,
"I THINK THIS ONE LIKES ME."

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
- DO YOU LIKE JOHN?
- NO!

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Brazelton:
 AT THIS AGE,
 THE BLOSSOMING AWARENESS

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
AND ATTRACTION TAKE
 CHARACTERISTIC FORM.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Colucci:
 WE SEE SOME OF THE EARLY
 STAGES OF FLIRTING,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
BUT AT THIS STAGE,
 IT'S CHARACTERISTICALLY

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
KIND OF NEGATIVE ATTENTION,
 WHERE THEY'LL BE, YOU KNOW,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
THROWING A BALL
OVER AT A GIRL,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
OR A GIRL WOULD BE
KICKING A BOY'S LEG,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
 JUST TO GET THEIR ATTENTION.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Brazelton:
 SCIENCE HAS NO GOOD ANSWER
 FOR THAT ONE...

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
THAT'S KELLY'S DESK.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
...EXCEPT TO KNOW THAT
 IT'S THE BEGINNING
 OF A NEW STAGE

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
IN A LIFELONG JOURNEY

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
OF DISCOVERING
 THE WORLD AND THE SELF--

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
AS GIRL, YES...

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
* AND I GET THE BOTTOM... *

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
...BUT, MORE IMPORTANT,
 A UNIQUE

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
AND THOROUGHLY
 COMPLETE PERSON.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
JOINING ME TODAY

OUR INTERNET EXPERT
 FROM IBM.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
CRYSTAL, WHAT DOES THE INTERNET
OFFER SPECIFICALLY FOR GIRLS?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
BERRY, THERE ARE A LOT
OF WONDERFUL SITES.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
ONE THAT WE'RE
GONNA LOOK AT TODAY,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
SPONSORED BY
 MT. HOLYOKE COLLEGE,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
HAS SOMETHING FOR GIRLS,
 IN TERMS OF MATHEMATICS,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
ATHLETICS, THEY ACTUALLY
 HAVE ROLE MODELS

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
THAT YOU CAN GO AND DO
 RESEARCH ON, FOR GIRLS.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
ALSO, THEY HAVE
 A SAMPLING OF RESOURCES

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
AND SPECIFIC PROGRAMS
 FOR GIRLS THAT ARE OFFERED

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
FROM NUMEROUS COLLEGES
 THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
ANOTHER WEBSITE DESIGNED
 SPECIFICALLY FOR GIRLS

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
IS SPONSORED
 BY GIRLS INC.,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
AND THIS HAS TIPS
 FOR PARENTS AND ADULTS,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
AND THEY ALSO HAVE A SPECIAL
 WEB SITE JUST FOR GIRLS.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
IF WE GO
 TO THAT WEB SITE,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
WE CAN SEE THAT
 THERE ARE ACTIVITIES
 DESIGNED JUST FOR THEM.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
SO, YES, BARRY, THERE'S
QUITE A BIT OF INFORMATION

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
DESIGNED JUST FOR GIRLS--
LITTLE GIRLS AND BIG GIRLS,
RIGHT HERE ON THE INTERNET.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
AND BARRY, OUR QUESTION TODAY
FROM THE INTERNET

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
COMES FROM TABITHA
IN PAYNESVILLE, MINNESOTA.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
HER QUESTION IS,
 "I'M A STAY-AT-HOME MOTHER
 WITH ONE LITTLE GIRL.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
WHAT CAN I DO TO MAXIMIZE
 THE LIMITED TIME

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
MY HUSBAND HAS TO SPEND
 WITH OUR DAUGHTER?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I KNOW THE FATHER-DAUGHTER
 RELATIONSHIP IS ESSENTIAL

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
IN BUILDING
 MY DAUGHTER'S SELF-ESTEEM.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
DO YOU HAVE
 ANY SUGGESTIONS?"

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
WELL, I THINK
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
THE FATHER-DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP
IS A VERY MAJOR PART

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
OF A LITTLE GIRL'S FEELINGS
ABOUT HERSELF.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
SO, SURE, I'D REINFORCE
THEIR TIMES TOGETHER.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I'D HELP HIM SET UP
SOME TIMES

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
FOR, UH, THEM TO BE
TOGETHER ALONE, GO OFF TOGETHER,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
AND THEN IF YOU USE
THE TELEPHONE TO CALL HER
AND SAY,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
"I MISS YOU, I WISH
I COULD BE THERE WITH YOU,"

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
ALL OF THOSE WOULD HELP.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
BUT THERE MAY BE SOMETHING HERE
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
THAT YOU DON'T NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
WHEN HE COMES HOME,
DOES SHE REJECT HIM,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
TURN AWAY FROM HIM, ACT AS IF
SHE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT HIM?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
YOU KNOW, THAT COULD BE
INTERPRETED TWO WAYS.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
ONE IS TO TAKE IT
THE WAY IT'S SHOWN,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
BUT THE OTHER
IS TO SAY,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
"I'VE MISSED YOU
ALL DAY LONG, DADDY,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
AND I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE HOME."

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
NOBODY WOULD BE LIKELY
TO SEE THAT.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
SO, WHAT ABOUT TELLING HIM
THAT THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000

THE PARENTING INSTITUTE
 AT pampers.com.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
GIRLS HAVE ISSUES THAT ARE
VERY DIFFERENT FROM BOYS.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
WITH ME IS DR. JOY BROWN,
PSYCHOLOGIST AND HOST

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
OF HER OWN RADIO
 AND TELEVISION SHOWS.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
JOY, IF YOU'RE
A PARENT,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
RAISING A BOY AND A GIRL?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I THINK NUMBER ONE IS
THE SENSE OF PHYSICAL FREEDOM.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
YOU'VE TALKED
A LOT ABOUT THAT.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
EVEN IN THE EYE MOVEMENTS,
WE REALLY ENCOURAGE BOYS
TO VIEW THE ENTIRE WORLD--

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
- AS THEIR OWN?
- ABSOLUTELY.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
WHEREAS, GIRLS STAY
CLOSER TO HOME,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
AND IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT VERY EARLY ON,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE
LITTLE GIRLS TO BE

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
PHYSICALLY ACTIVE,
TO VIEW THEMSELVES AS POWERFUL,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
AND NOT AT RISK,
AND HAVE A LOT MORE FREEDOM.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
DO WE THINK OF LITTLE GIRLS--
I MEAN, LITTLE BOYS

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
AS SHOWOFFS
AND MASTERING THE WORLD,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
AND LITTLE GIRLS AS BEING
SORT OF SECOND RATE?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
NOT SO MUCH SECOND RATE,
BUT THAT THE WORLD IS RISKY,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
AND THEREFORE THEY CAN'T
NEGOTIATE IT ON THEIR TERMS.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
SO THEY HAVE TO BE COMPLIANT,
THEY HAVE TO BE GOOD,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
THEY HAVE TO BE ATTRACTIVE,
LITERALLY ATTRACTIVE.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
WE HAVE TO GET SOMEONE
TO TAKE CARE OF US,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I DON'T THINK
MEN ARE THE PROBLEM.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE THE SOLUTION.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
MEN HAVE HAD JUST AS DIFFICULT
A TIME AS WOMEN,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
BECAUSE WE'VE REALLY
ALLOWED MEN PHYSICAL OPENNESS.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
WE DON'T ALLOW MEN
MUCH EMOTIONAL OPENNESS.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
LITTLE BOYS TODAY,
GOING OUT, FEELING THAT--

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
THERE ARE SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED
DISEASES, THERE'S PREGNANCY--

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF THINGS
THAT MEN, HISTORICALLY HAVE

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
BEEN ABLE
TO WALK AWAY FROM,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
THAT ARE NO LONGER
ABLE TO WALK AWAY FROM.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
WE DON'T WANT
CHILDREN RAISING CHILDREN.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
WE CAN TEACH CHILDREN
ABOUT THEIR SEXUALITY.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
WE CAN TEACH THEM
ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
BUT PART OF THE MISTAKEN
NOTION ABOUT ADOLESCENCE

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
IS THAT BOYS SEE LIFE
THROUGH A SPERMY GREEN HAZE,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME,
ANYBODY'S A TARGET.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
AND LITTLE GIRLS, THEREFORE,
HAVE TO BE THE GATEKEEPERS,
"NO, NO, NO. NO, NO."

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
THAT IS A RIDICULOUS NOTION
ON SEVERAL FRONTS.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
FIRST, IT MEANS
BOYS CAN BE IRRESPONSIBLE,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
AND GIRLS DENY
THEIR OWN SEXUALITY.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
BUT THE ONLY STUDIES
I'VE EVER SEEN SAY,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
LITTLE GIRLS WHO HAVE
AN AFTER-SCHOOL JOB,
FOR EXAMPLE,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
ARE MUCH LESS PRONE
TO EARLY PREGNANCY.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
SOME WAY TO TAKE CARE
OF THEMSELVES,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
AS OPPOSED TO FEEL THAT
THEIR SELF-IMAGE

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
IS BASED ON ATTRACTING
SOMEBODY ELSE, A BOY.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
THEY GO FROM BEING
DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
TO SOMEBODY'S GIRLFRIEND,
TO SOMEBODY'S WIFE,
TO SOMEBODY'S MOTHER.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
THE EARLIER ON WE TEACH
BOYS AND GIRLS TO BE SOMEBODY,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
WE'VE GOT
BALANCED KIDS.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
THE THING YOU SAY, TO ME,
THAT I WOULD WANT

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
TO REINFORCE TO PARENTS
OF YOUNG CHILDREN WOULD BE,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
IF YOU VALUE A LITTLE GIRL
FOR HER PERSONALITY,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
FOR HER TEMPERAMENT,
FOR WHO SHE IS,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
SHE'S GONNA BE SO SECURE,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
SHE'S NOT GONNA HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ATTRACTING EVERYBODY.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
WELL, IT WILL ALSO GIVE HER
SPECIFIC-- HELP HER TO DEVELOP

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
COMPETENCE,
AS WELL AS CONFIDENCE.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
UM, MOST PARENTS-- I THINK
YOU'RE ON THE MONEY HERE.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
IF A KID COMES IN AND SAYS,
"MOMMY, DO YOU LIKE MY PICTURE?"

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
EVERY GOOD PARENT SAYS,
"IT'S WONDERFUL."

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
THAT'S THE WRONG ANSWER!

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
THE RIGHT ANSWER IS,
"DO YOU LIKE YOUR PICTURE?"

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
AND IT'S SOMETHING
THAT DOESN'T OCCUR TO US.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
IF WE GIVE OUR CHILDREN
A SENSE OF SELF-RELIANCE,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
THAT WHAT THEY ARE IS OKAY,
AND THE KID WILL THEN SAY,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
"YEAH, I LIKE IT," OR,
"NO, IT'S NOT MY BEST,"

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
THAT WE LOSE THAT SENSE--

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
BECAUSE OF OUR IDEALIZED NOTION
OF WHAT CHILDREN ARE LIKE--

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
THAT THERE IS
A SENTIENT BEING THERE,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
THERE IS A PERSONALITY IN THERE,
THERE IS A PERSON IN THERE.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
OUR JOB IS NOT TO MOLD THEM,
'CAUSE IT'S IN THERE,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
BUT JUST HELP THEM
DISCOVER WHO IT IS.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
BECAUSE THAT COMPLETES
THE CYCLE, DOESN'T IT?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
- YEAH, YEAH.
- "YOU DID IT YOURSELF."

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
BECAUSE WHEN A PARENT SAYS,
"I LOVE IT,"

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
AND THE KID SAYS,
"WHAT? I DON'T LIKE IT.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
BOY, MY PARENTS
ARE REALLY STUPID."

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
NO MATTER WHAT YOUR ANSWER IS,
IT'S THE WRONG ANSWER,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
THE RIGHT ANSWER
IS THE QUESTION,
"WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
THAT'S WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU!  THIS IS GREAT.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
YOU'RE WELCOME.
MY PLEASURE.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
AND WE CAN STOP
YOU FROM GIGGLING
THROUGH THE WHOLE THING.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Brazelton:
 NEXT, WE TALK TO PARENTS
 ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Woman:
 WE'VE SOLD OUT.
 WE HAVE OVER 900 PEOPLE--

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Brazelton:
 EACH YEAR, WE TRAVEL
 ALL OVER AMERICA...

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Man:
 OUR COMMUNITY IS
 SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
...TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
 FROM THOUSANDS OF PARENTS.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Emcee:
 I'D LIKE TO WELCOME
 DR. T. BERRY BRAZELTON.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Brazelton:
 HERE ARE SOME OF THEM.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
A FATHER!
YOU ARE A FATHER?
( laughs )

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
- I AM A FATHER.
- THATTABOY.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
MY QUESTION DEALS WITH--
IF YOU COULD GIVE ANY ADVICE

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
TO A FATHER ON HOW
HE SHOULD DEAL

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
WITH HIS DAUGHTER'S QUESTIONS
ABOUT HER DEVELOPMENT.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
SHE'S ONLY 3 1/2 NOW,
AND SHE POINTS

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
TO THE DIFFERENT
ANATOMICAL DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN HER AND MY SON.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
OH, I KNOW!
IT'S TERRIBLE, ISN'T IT?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
YES, IT IS.
AND WHAT ABOUT LATER ON,
WHEN SHE'S A TEENAGER?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I USED TO GO TO THE TOILET,
 AND I'D HEAR

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
SIX LITTLE FEET
COME PATTERING IN TO SEE.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
I DEAL WITH THAT
WHEN I TELL HER THAT
DADDY NEEDS A LITTLE PRIVACY.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
WELL, THAT'S AVOIDING IT,
ISN'T IT?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
YEAH, YES, IT IS.
( laughs )

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
BUT I CAN'T AVOID IT WHEN I
CHANGE HER BROTHER'S DIAPERS,
THOUGH.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
HER QUESTION IS,
"DADDY, WHAT'S THAT?"
AS SHE POINTS TO--

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
- TO HIS PEE-PEE?
- HOW DO I HANDLE
 THIS SITUATION?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- THAT'S HOW HER BROTHER
 DOES PEE-PEE.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE GETTIN' THERE.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
AND THEN, HER NEXT
QUESTION IS, "BUT--"

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
"UH, YOU DON'T HAVE ONE."
( laughs )

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
( laughing )
BOY, THAT IS SEXIST,
ISN'T IT,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
IF I EVER HEARD?!

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
HOW ABOUT SAYING,
"YOURS IS JUST INSIDE,
AND HIS IS OUTSIDE."

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
OH, OKAY.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
( laughs )
OR ELSE, YOU DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
IT IS A HARD SUBJECT
 FOR ME TO SPEAK ABOUT.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
IS IT? YEAH.
MEN WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO DEAL
WITH THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
MAYBE IF YOU CALL ME
A TRADITIONAL DAD,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
WELL,
I DON'T KNOW, UM--

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
IT'S TIME TO THINK ABOUT THAT,
BECAUSE WE WERE RAISED

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
NOT TO THINK THAT WAS
GONNA BE OUR JOB,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
BUT YET, THIS LITTLE
GIRL IS TELLING YOU,
"THIS IS YOUR JOB."

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
THERE'S A WONDERFUL BOOK
CALLED, IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
BY A WOMAN
NAMED ROBIE HARRIS.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
YOU OUGHTA GET THAT.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
IT'S A WAY OF TALKING
TO CHILDREN ABOUT THESE THINGS.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
THEY CAN SEE IT GRAPHICALLY,
AND YOU CAN, TOO,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
WHICH MIGHT HELP.
 ( laughs )

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
THE TWO OF YOU
 CAN SHARE IT,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
AND THE MORE OPEN
YOU CAN BE WITH HER,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
THE MORE SHE'LL ASK YOU
AND THE MORE SHE'LL COME
TO YOU WHEN SHE NEEDS IT.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
YOU'RE REALLY PREPARING
AT 3 1/2--

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
A WHOLE LIFETIME
OF CONFIDENTIALITIES,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
WHICH I WOULDN'T WANT
TO MISS OUT ON, WOULD YOU?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
- NO, I WOULDN'T.
- NO.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
GOOD FOR YOU, FOR ASKING THIS.
SHE REALLY WANTS IT FROM YOU.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
I DON'T THINK
HER MOMMY WOULD BE ENOUGH.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
- OKAY, THANK YOU.
- GREAT.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
( audience applauding )

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
HI, MY NAME IS SARA, AND I HAVE
AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
WHO GETS VERY EMOTIONAL
AND SOMETIMES EVEN CRIES

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
WHEN SHE'S CONFRONTED WITH
HER SISTER, FOR WHATEVER REASON,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
AND SOMETIMES EVEN
WHEN SHE DOESN'T GET HER WAY.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
IT'S WHEN WE EXPLAIN
WHY SHE CAN'T DO SOMETHING,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
OR WHY IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY,
AND IT HAS TO BE THIS WAY--

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
SHE GETS EMOTIONAL, OVERWHELMED,
AND TEARS COME TO HER EYES,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
AND SHE'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT
WHERE SHE EVEN REALIZES IT.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
WHAT WORRIES YOU?

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
WHAT WORRIES ME IS THAT
I'M NOT SURE

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
IF THIS IS
A HORMONAL ISSUE ALREADY.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
BECAUSE OUR 12 YEAR OLD
 WENT THROUGH SOMETHING SIMILAR
 AT THE AGE OF 11.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
AND I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS
SOMETHING SHE'S GOING THROUGH
AT AN EARLIER AGE.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN TO YOU?
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
SHE'S VERY ACTIVE
IN EVERYTHING SHE DOES.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
SHE PUTS A LOT OF EMOTION
TO EVERYTHING.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
I'M WONDERING IF,
 BECAUSE OF THAT,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
ALL OF THAT EMOTION
COMES TO THE SURFACE

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
WHEN SHE'S TRYING TO EXPLAIN
HERSELF AND CAN'T.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
YEAH, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
DEEPER THAT'S BOTHERING YOU.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
IT IS, BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE--
ONLY HAVING TWO DAUGHTERS--

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
I ONLY HAVE ONE
TO DRAW EXPERIENCE FROM.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
- AND YOU CAN'T HELP
 BUT COMPARE 'EM, CAN YOU?
- YOU CAN'T, YOU CAN'T.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
IF YOU DIDN'T.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
IF YOU UNDERSTAND, THIS CHILD
IS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
BUT NONE OF THAT
IS WORRISOME TO ME.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
I'M FASCINATED
 WITH YOUR QUESTION

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
ABOUT WHETHER SHE'S GOING
THROUGH EARLY ADOLESCENCE.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
AND THIS BOTHERS YOU?

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
A LITTLE BIT.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD
CHANGE HER TOO EARLY.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
NOW, 8 IS
MORE LIKE 11, ISN'T IT?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
YEAH, SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT,
MAYBE I SHOULD HANDLE HER

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
MORE LIKE I SHOULD
HANDLE A 10 YEAR OLD.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
INSTEAD OF SAYING,
 "LAURA, STOP CRYING,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
LET'S JUST TALK
ABOUT THIS NOW,"

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
INSTEAD OF CUDDLING HER,
WHICH I'M DOING NOW.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
I'M HOLDING HER AND SAYING,
"LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS."

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
THAT SOUNDS SO NICE.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
SO, I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M DOING THAT RIGHT,
OR IF I SHOULD-- TOUGH LOVE.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO DO THE OTHER?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
THAT'S NOT ME, SO I DON'T KNOW
IF I SHOULD DO THAT.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
YOU'VE ALREADY ANSWERED IT.
IT WOULDN'T BE ME, EITHER.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
SO, I WOULDN'T DO IT,
AND I THINK SHE WOULDN'T
GET ANYTHING

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
FROM THAT,
EXCEPT REJECTION.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
YOU DON'T WANNA
 DO THAT, DO YOU?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
- NO, NO.
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
 WHY SHE'S DOING IT.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
SHE'S GOING THROUGH
SOMETHING IMPORTANT--

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
MAYBE PHYSIOLOGICAL,
IT MIGHT BE PSYCHOLOGICAL.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON WITH HER

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
THAT LET HER REGRESS
TO THESE PERIODS

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
OF FALLING APART--
I CALL THESE "TOUCH POINTS."

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
JUST BEFORE
A SPURT IN DEVELOPMENT,
LIKE HER MATURATION,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
OR WHATEVER SHE'S FACING
THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
I WOULDN'T HESITATE TO DO
JUST WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
JUST PICK HER UP,
AND LOVE HER, AND SAY,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
"WE'LL GO
THROUGH THIS TOGETHER."

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
- ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
- RIGHT, IT IS.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
DON'T YOU FEEL BETTER
 ABOUT THAT?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
- I DO--
- LOOK WHAT YOU'RE DOING
 WHEN YOU DO THAT FOR HER.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
YOU'RE SAYING, "WE WANNA BE
WITH YOU THROUGH THIS,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
WHATEVER YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH,"

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
THEN WHEN SHE HITS ADOLESCENCE,
YOU'RE THERE WITH HER.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
YOU'RE SETTING UP
 BUILDING BLOCKS FOR THE FUTURE.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
SUPPOSE YOU SHOVED HER OUT
AND SAID, "BE STRONG.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
DEAL WITH IT YOURSELF."

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
WOULDN'T YOU BE GIVING HER
A MESSAGE?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
- THAT'S GREAT. WONDERFUL.
- THANK YOU.

BRAZELTON ON PARENTING,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
PRESENTED BY
 THE PARENTING INSTITUTE
 AT pampers.com.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
I MUST ADMIT, GIRLS CAN BE
A MYSTERY TO A FATHER.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
I HAVE THREE DAUGHTERS,
AND IT WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
UNDERSTANDING THEIR STRUGGLES
THAN IT WAS MY SON'S.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
BUT IF WE MAKE THE EFFORT
TO UNDERSTAND THEM,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
OUR GIRLS CAN BLOSSOM,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
TAKING THE IMPORTANT ROLES
WE'VE TRADITIONALLY GIVEN THEM,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
AND ADDING A WHOLE NEW WORLD
OF EXCITING POSSIBILITIES.
