00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:31.029
[♪♪♪]

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.209
YEAH, "LOWBROW" IS, YOU KNOW,

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.129
SOMETHING... SOMEBODY USED<br/>FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.039
ART THAT, OH...

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.019
NOBODY ELSE KNOWS<br/>HOW TO CATEGORIZE.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.179
YEAH, WELL, I MEAN,<br/>YOU GET EMAILS ALL THE TIME,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.169
PORNO SITES THAT SAY "LOWBROW."

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.159
SO I WOULD NEVER CALL MYSELF<br/>A LOWBROW ARTIST, NO.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.009
WHAT I DO, I DO,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.289
AND I DON'T LIKE<br/>TO LABEL THINGS, REALLY.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.239
IT'S ESSENTIALLY REACTIONARY<br/>AGAINST HIGHBROW CULTURE,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.089
SO THAT'S WHERE "LOWBROW"<br/>COMES FROM,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.999
THE IDEA IS

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.099
WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO<br/>WITH COLOUR-FIELD CANVASES,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.139
URINALS IN GALLERIES<br/>AND THINGS LIKE THAT,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.099
AND THAT KIND OF SNOTTY ATTITUDE

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.049
DIDN'T MAKE PEOPLE<br/>WHO CALL THEMSELVES LOWBROW

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.079
WELCOME IN THE UPPER ECHELONS<br/>OF THE ART WORLD.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.199
I MEAN BASICALLY

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.099
YOU'RE THUMBING YOUR NOSE<br/>AT PEOPLE,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.209
AND THEN YOU CAN'T EXPECT THEM<br/>TO INVITE YOU IN FOR DINNER.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.019
SOME CARTOONIST HAD DRAWN

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.279
THE ARCHETYPAL HIGHBROW PERSON,<br/>MIDDLEBROW, AND LOWBROW,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.229
AND LOWBROW WAS KIND OF LIKE<br/>YOU HAD TO SAY

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.139
OKAY, THIS MUST HAVE BEEN<br/>THE CRO-MAGNONS OR SOMETHING,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.999
YOU KNOW, THE LOWBROWS.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.229
IT'S A CATCHALL PHRASE OF A WORD<br/>THAT'S ALREADY OUT THERE,

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.209
SO IT HAS CONNOTATIONS

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.049
BEFORE IT WAS APPLIED<br/>TO ARTWORK.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.159
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THAT

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.059
BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE<br/>THOSE CONNOTATIONS.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.229
[PRESSMAN]:<br/>INITIALLY, IT WAS USED

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.189
IN RELATION<br/>TO A LOT OF THE PAINTINGS

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.219
HAVING NAKED GIRLS IN THEM<br/>AND HOT RODS,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.159
AND LOWBROW TYPE OF IMAGERY.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.109
THE FACT THAT THE NAME<br/>JUST CAUGHT ON AND STUCK

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.209
I THINK IT'S EVOLVED<br/>INTO A MEANING OF ITS OWN.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.149
I ORIGINATED A TERM,<br/>AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.039
I'VE GOT SEVEN BOOKS OUT,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.099
AND MY FIRST BOOK WAS CALLED

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.039
THE LOWBROW ART<br/>OF ROBT. WILLIAMS,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.189
AND IT COME OUT IN 1979.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.259
THAT'S WHERE<br/>THAT TERM COME FROM.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.009
[PRESSMAN]: I THINK<br/>A MORE APPROPRIATE TERM

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.229
WOULD BE LOWBROW SURREALISM,

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.089
AND LIKE I SAY AGAIN, "LOWBROW"<br/>WOULD HAVE A MEANING OF ITS OWN.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.179
IT'S KIND OF EVOLVED<br/>INTO A MEANING OF ITS OWN,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.049
AND IT DOESN'T REALLY<br/>PARTICULARLY MEAN

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.069
WHAT IT MEANT ORIGINALLY,

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.129
WHICH WAS, LIKE I SAY,<br/>PORNOGRAPHY.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.099
MY PARTNER, GREG ESCALANTE,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.289
HE STARTED CALLING IT "NEWBROW"<br/>FOR THAT VERY REASON,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.159
AND I LIKE THAT TERM.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.099
[SIGH]

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.999
MAYBE "NOBROW."

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.069
I LIKE "LOWBROW" JUST BECAUSE<br/>IT'S PRETTY TO THE POINT.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.999
I'M NOT THAT KEEN<br/>ON "POP SURREALISM,"

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.079
BECAUSE TO ME SURREALISM<br/>WAS A SPECIFIC ART MOVEMENT.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.199
SURREALISM WAS A MANIFESTO, SEE,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.069
IT WAS A STRICT MANIFESTO,

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.229
AND THEY THROW YOUR ASS<br/>OUT OF SURREALISM IF...

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.169
THEY HAD MOCK TRIALS.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.159
[SHAG]: TO ME, A LOT OF, LIKE,<br/>LOWBROW ART IS NOT SURREAL.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.059
I MEAN, WHAT SURREAL ART<br/>REALLY WAS,

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.289
I DON'T THINK LOWBROW ART<br/>IS THAT SAME THING,

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.209
SO THAT'S WHY I PREFER<br/>THE TERM "LOWBROW."

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.289
[THE PIZZ]: NO, IT REALLY<br/>DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.149
TO DO WITH LOWBROW.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.249
YOU LET'S SAY GET AN ARTIST<br/>LIKE ISABEL SAMARAS,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.219
WHO IS A VERY FINE OIL PAINTER<br/>TRADITIONALLY,

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.269
AND THE ONLY THING LOWBROW<br/>ABOUT IT

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.219
IS SHE'S USING<br/>TV SHOW CHARACTERS.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.149
IT'S LIKE OH, WELL,<br/>IF YOU GUYS ARE HIGHBROW

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.129
AND WE'RE NOT ALLOWED<br/>TO PLAY IN YOUR SANDBOX,

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.179
THEN WE'LL MAKE OUR OWN SANDBOX,

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.129
AND OURS IS GOING TO BE<br/>ALL-INCLUSIVE.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.009
ANYBODY CAN PLAY.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.169
IT SEEMS TO BE ABOUT,<br/>LIKE, HEART.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.139
IF YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH,<br/>YOU KNOW, THE HEART OR THE BALLS

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.049
OR THE ENERGY OR THE INTEREST<br/>TO DO SOMETHING,

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.199
THEN IT SEEMS<br/>TO DRAW AN ATTRACTION,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:17.179
AND EVERYBODY SEEMS WILLING<br/>TO LOOK AT IT AND ENJOY IT.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.279
MUCH MORE OF A POPULIST THING.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.179
IT'S MORE<br/>OF A PEOPLE THING.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.209
THERE'S NOT SO MUCH<br/>OF AN EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.189
WHERE SOMEONE'S TRYING TO SAY

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.099
"THIS ITEM<br/>IS UNBELIEVABLY GREAT,"

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.059
AS THE MORE ESTABLISHED<br/>GALLERY ROUTINE WOULD GO.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.139
[12 MIDNITE]:<br/>IT'S THE LIFESTYLE,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.019
IT'S THE PEOPLE,<br/>IT IS A SOCIAL SCENE.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.079
IN A DIFFERENT TIME<br/>OR A DIFFERENT PLACE,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.229
WE MIGHT BE MEMBERS OF,

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.289
I DON'T KNOW, THE SHRINERS,<br/>RIGHT?

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.999
WHO KNOWS.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.269
WHAT MAKES US A GROUP OR A SCENE

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:54.079
IS WE HAVE A COMMON LOVE<br/>OR A COMMON EXPERIENCE

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.089
THAT MAKES US WANT TO<br/>NOT ONLY BE PART OF IT,

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.139
BUT ADD TO IT.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.259
IT REALLY REACHES OUT<br/>TO THE MASSES,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.139
AND PEOPLE, LIKE, CAN RELATE

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.019
TO THE IMAGERY<br/>THAT THEY'RE SEEING,

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.229
YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT BE,<br/>YOU KNOW, CAR CULTURE

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.249
OR, YOU KNOW, POPULAR CULTURE<br/>AND PINUP

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.069
AND ALL THAT OTHER STUFF.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.149
I MEAN, THERE IS A HISTORICAL<br/>REFERENCE THERE

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.019
THAT I THINK IS MORE PERSONAL

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.089
THAN SOMETHING<br/>THAT'S MORE ESOTERIC.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.049
[SHIRE]:TO A CERTAIN EXTENT,<br/>IT HAS, YOU KNOW,

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.999
A HISTORY IN FOLK ART.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.029
YOU CAN GO BACK<br/>TO SCRIMSHAW AND TATTOOING.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.289
COMING FROM WORLD WAR II

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.049
WITH THE AIRPLANES THAT WERE<br/>PAINTED WITH THE WOMEN ON THEM,

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.119
THE SORT OF PIN-UP STYLE<br/>THAT CAME INTO THE STREETS

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.159
AND FILTERED IN<br/>THROUGH THE HOT-ROD CULTURE.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.059
A LOT OF THE MECHANICS<br/>AND CAR-BUILDERS

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.239
SEEMED TO BECOME ARTISTS<br/>FROM THAT.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.049
OF COURSE, VON DUTCH<br/>AND ROBERT WILLIAMS AND ED ROTH

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.269
IN THE '60s AND '70s,

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.189
BRINGING IN A LOT OF THE FAME,<br/>I GUESS,

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.219
TO THE LOWBROW ART MOVEMENT<br/>AND MAKING IT SOMETHING.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:10.239
[♪♪♪]

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.109
I'M DEFINITELY CONSUMED<br/>BY POP CULTURE REFERENCES,

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.189
ESPECIALLY IF THE REFERENCES<br/>GO BACK TO MY CHILDHOOD.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.079
THAT'S WHERE THINGS<br/>LIKE DR. ZAIUS MIGHT COME FROM.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.219
SOMETHING ELSE, LIKE THE BULL,

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.089
YOU KNOW, THAT'S SORT OF<br/>A PICASSO THING.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.999
I SEE IT AS GOING BACK TO THAT.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.289
UM, AND YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF TOYS<br/>AND ARTWORK IN MY PAINTING.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.069
A LOT OF IT<br/>IS STUFF I OWN MYSELF

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.219
OR STUFF THAT I'D LIKE TO OWN,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.159
OR STUFF THAT I'D LIKE TO OWN,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.079
SO, YOU KNOW,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:48.999
IT KIND OF COMES FULL CIRCLE<br/>TO THE CONSUMERISM THING.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.269
[12 MIDNITE]:<br/>I THINK WE ALL LOOK BACK

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.999
ON THE '40s, THE '50s,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.109
EVEN THE '60s, EVEN THE '70s NOW

00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:00.179
AS A MORE INTERESTING<br/>AESTHETIC TIME TO LIVE IN.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.279
ONE THING THAT IS ALSO GENERALLY<br/>VERY IMPORTANT

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.249
WITH THIS SCHOOL OF ART

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.129
IS THE POST WORLD WAR II PERIOD

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.069
WHICH IS CALLED THE ATOMIC AGE<br/>OR THE SPACE AGE.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.139
SAY, FROM THE LATE '40s,<br/>EARLY '50s

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.019
UP THROUGH THE MID '60s,

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.029
YOU ALSO HAD A LOT OF B MOVIES<br/>THAT WERE VERY INFLUENTIAL

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.189
AND COMIC BOOKS

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.069
AND ALSO THE McCARTHYISM<br/>THAT WAS GOING ON,

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.179
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WERE<br/>VERY PARANOID OF THIS COLD WAR.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.029
WORLD WAR II IS OVER,<br/>AMERICA WAS PROSPERING,

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.219
BUT PEOPLE WERE<br/>BUILDING BOMB SHELTERS STILL

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.029
IN THEIR HOUSE,

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.199
AND THEY WERE VERY AFRAID<br/>OF BEING NUKED.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.019
THAT WAS SOMETHING

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.099
THAT WAS LINGERING<br/>OVER OUR SHOULDER.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.169
McCARTHYISM WAS VERY EAGER<br/>TO POINT FINGERS

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.079
AT ANYBODY<br/>THAT DEVIATED FROM THE NORM

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.279
AND ANYBODY THAT DEVIATED<br/>FROM THE NORM,

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.239
OF COURSE, WAS A COMMIE,

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:52.069
AND THAT WAS BAD STUFF.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.269
ALSO AT THIS SAME TIME,

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.999
YOU HAD THIS AMERICAN<br/>CONSUMER CULTURE DEVELOPING,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.259
ESPECIALLY<br/>IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.219
WITH THE AUTOMOBILE<br/>BACK IN PRODUCTION

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.099
AFTER THE WAR,

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.099
THE FREEWAY SYSTEM<br/>OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.189
DISNEYLAND OPENED ITS DOORS<br/>IN 1955,

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.149
THESE WERE ALL<br/>VERY IMPORTANT IMAGES.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.029
YOU ALSO HAD SURF MOVIES<br/>COMING ON STRONG

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:18.009
THAT HAD ANNETTE FUNICELLO<br/>AND THE MALIBU BEACH SCENE HERE,

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.009
YOU HAD THE 2.2 KIDS,<br/>AMERICAN FAMILY EMERGING,

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.029
SUBURBIA,

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.219
ALL THESE THINGS

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.059
KIND OF WENT INTO<br/>BEING THE INSPIRATION

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:44.039
FOR THIS TYPE OF ART.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.139
[AUSGANG]: "ART" IS THIS WORD

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.139
THAT COVERS<br/>SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.119
FROM CONCEPT ART,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.019
WHICH IS SOMEBODY WHO DECIDES

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.169
THEY'RE GOING TO SIT<br/>ON A STREET CORNER FOR FIVE DAYS

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.249
AND CALL THAT, YOU KNOW,<br/>THEIR PIECE OF ART,

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.179
TO PAINTINGS AND SCULPTURES<br/>AND SO FORTH,

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.039
SO YEAH, WE NEED<br/>TO HAVE CATEGORIES

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.199
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.109
THAT'S THE JOB OF THE CRITICS.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.009
AS AN ARTIST,<br/>OUR JOB IS JUST TO MAKE THE ART,

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:09.089
AND LET SOMEBODY ELSE ANALYZE IT<br/>AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.219
THESE TERMINOLOGIES,

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.109
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO HELP YOU<br/>WITH THESE THINGS,

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.279
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD<br/>OUR ANDRE BRETON TO COME IN HERE

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.159
AND WRITE THE MANIFESTOES, SEE?

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.039
SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.159
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME<br/>INTELLIGENT WRITERS

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.149
THAT CAN FUSE ALL THIS TOGETHER,

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.999
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM<br/>LIKE THAT'S RIGHT NOW.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.069
[PRESSMAN]: ROBERT, YOU KNOW,

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.099
HAS BEEN AROUND<br/>LONGER THAN ANYBODY.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.219
HE STARTED WITH ZAP COMICS

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.049
AND HANGING OUT<br/>WITH BIG DADDY ROTH

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.239
AND VON DUTCH

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.999
AND ALL THE PEOPLE<br/>IN THE KUSTOM KULTURE MOVEMENT.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.049
I ACTUALLY WENT TO A SHOW IN,<br/>LIKE, 1981

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.079
AND SAW A DISPLAY<br/>OF HIS PAINTINGS.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.259
YOU KNOW, NO ONE ELSE<br/>WAS DOING ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.029
THAT'S GROUND ZERO,<br/>THE EARLY '80s,

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.209
AND THAT WAS REALLY<br/>THE ONLY THING AT ALL

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.999
HAPPENING AT THAT TIME.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.139
I DON'T THINK<br/>THERE WAS ANYBODY ELSE

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.229
DOING ANYTHING CLOSE<br/>TO THAT QUALITY.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:10:03.289
[♪♪♪]

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.199
[WILLIAMS]: REPRESENTATIONAL ART

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.129
HAS BEEN DEAD FOR ABOUT 50 YEARS<br/>NOW IN ART SCHOOLS.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.219
IT'S JUST OUTRE, YOU SEE?

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.219
START AT ART SCHOOL.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.239
I TRIED TO UTILIZE MY INTERESTS

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.259
IN THE GRAPHICS<br/>THAT I WAS ATTRACTED TO,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.219
PULP MAGAZINES AND COMIC BOOKS<br/>AND LURID MATERIAL,

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.039
B MOVIE POSTERS,

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.109
AND THINGS LIKE THAT,

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.159
STUFF THAT JUST<br/>REALLY EXCITED ME,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.149
AND SO WHEN I STARTED<br/>INTO THE ARTS,

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.019
I THOUGHT I COULD BRING

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.019
THAT ROMANCE AND ZEITGEIST<br/>WITH ME.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.159
WELL, I WAS IN<br/>FOR A BIG SURPRISE,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.199
BECAUSE IN THE LATE '50s<br/>AND EARLY '60s,

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.139
THE DOMINATING ART FORM<br/>WAS ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM,

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.269
AND IT DOMINATED ABSOLUTELY.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:52.099
I WAS IN AN ART LECTURE<br/>ONE TIME

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.069
AND THE TEACHER WAS SHOWING<br/>A SLIDE SHOW,

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.219
AND HE HAD<br/>A BIG PROJECTION THERE

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.269
OF RUBENS' PAINTING,<br/>CHRIST DESCENDING THE CROSS,

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.999
AND HE SAID<br/>"THIS IS NOT A PAINTING.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.029
THIS IS A COLOURED-IN DRAWING,"

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.269
AND I KNEW I WAS IN TROUBLE<br/>RIGHT THERE.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:13.029
I KNEW I WAS IN DEEP DOO-DOO<br/>RIGHT THERE

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:19.269
WHEN THAT STATEMENT WAS MADE.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.169
[NASON]: IT'S INTERESTING

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.139
THAT A LOT OF THE CLASSIFICATION<br/>BETWEEN,

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.129
SAY, A FINE ARTIST<br/>AND SOMETHING ELSE,

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:30.079
SAY, A GRAPHIC ARTIST<br/>OR, SAY, A COMMERCIAL ARTIST,

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.999
THAT THERE WAS SUCH<br/>A DISTINCTION GOING ON

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.009
BEFORE THE '60s.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.159
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE ARTISTS<br/>IS EDGAR LEETEG

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.229
THAT STARTED PAINTING ON VELVET<br/>IN TAHITI IN THE LATE 1940s,

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:45.009
AND HIS BACKGROUND,<br/>HE WAS A SIGN PAINTER.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.149
BIG DADDY ROTH<br/>WAS A FANTASTIC SIGN PAINTER,

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.089
AND VON DUTCH<br/>WAS A SIGN PAINTER.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.019
BIG DADDY ED ROTH CAME ALONG,

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.129
AND ROBERT WILLIAMS ENDED UP<br/>BEING HIS ART DIRECTOR.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:01.179
[LAVELLA]: YOU KNOW,<br/>THERE WOULD BE NO LOWBROW ART

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.049
CERTAINLY<br/>WITHOUT BIG DADDY ROTH,

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.999
AND DONNY DREW THIS<br/>AND I PUT THE HALO ON IT,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.139
AND I WAS, LIKE,<br/>HE NEEDS A HALO.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.229
[WILLIAMS]: ROTH WAS REALLY<br/>TAKEN WITH ME,

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.149
'CAUSE I COULD DRAW, SEE,

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.129
AND HE JUST SAID "WELL,<br/>IF I KNEW YOU WERE AROUND,

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.179
I'D HAVE HUNTED YOU UP,"

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.089
SO HE MADE ME HIS ART DIRECTOR,

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.109
AND I WAS KIND OF<br/>THE TROUBLESHOOTER AND WHATNOT.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.119
I'D WORK ON HIS CARS WITH HIM<br/>AND WHATNOT,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.069
AND THIS WAS 1965,

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.139
SO I STARTED MEETING

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.189
THE PSYCHEDELIC<br/>ROCK POSTER ARTISTS,

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:36.289
AND RICK GRIFFIN<br/>AND STANLEY MOUSE.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.159
[GIARLA]:<br/>THE ROCK POSTERS WERE HUGE

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.129
HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO<br/>IN THE '60s,

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.189
AND AGAIN, THERE WAS A LOT<br/>OF PSYCHEDELIA INVOLVED,

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.239
THEY WERE VERY POPPISH<br/>IN THE WAY THAT THERE WAS

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.079
A LOT OF BRIGHT<br/>VISUAL COLOURS USED.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.229
NOW, YOU KNOW,

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.019
THERE'S THIS HUGE RESURGENCE<br/>IN ROCK POSTERS

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.069
THAT INCORPORATE<br/>BOTH LOWBROW IMAGERY

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.119
AND CLASSIC '60s PSYCHEDELIA.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.269
IT'S HUGE NOW.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:10.039
[♪♪♪]

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.159
[WILLIAMS]: PSYCHEDELIC<br/>ROCK POSTERS IN THEIR HEYDAY

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.249
WERE KNOWN ALL OVER EUROPE<br/>IN MUSEUMS,

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.029
BUT THEY REFUSED TO SHOW THEM

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.059
IN MUSEUMS IN L.A.,<br/>IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.089
WOULDN'T SHOW 'EM, SEE?

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.089
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ACCEPTED,<br/>YOU KNOW?

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:28.259
THAT'S HIPPIES ON DRUGS,<br/>AND THAT WILL PASS.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.059
[AUSGANG]: MY DAD INTRODUCED ME<br/>TO UNDERGROUND COMICS

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.219
WHEN I WAS, LIKE,<br/>IN MY LATE TEENS,

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.189
AND A LOT OF THAT WAS ZAP COMICS<br/>AND AND OTHER STUFF

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.079
THAT WAS COMING OUT OF

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.219
THE SAN FRANCISCO<br/>UNDERGROUND COMIC BOOK SCENE,

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:44.219
SO I KIND OF SAW<br/>WHAT THESE GUYS WERE DOING

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.039
WITH THE CARTOON LANGUAGE<br/>AND COMICS LANGUAGE,

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.159
AND THEN BRINGING IT UP

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.169
AND GETTING ALL OF THESE<br/>SUBVERSIVE IDEAS ACROSS

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.169
LIKE THAT,

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:55.999
AND IT REALLY APPEALED TO ME.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.209
[WILLIAMS]: 1967, ROBERT CRUMB<br/>ENTERED THE PICTURE,

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.269
AND HE KIND OF WAS LIKE<br/>THE FIRESTORM

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:05.219
THAT GOT THE PSYCHEDELIC<br/>ROCK POSTER ARTISTS

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.139
TO START DOING<br/>UNDERGROUND COMICS.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.089
THAT WAS WELL ON ITS WAY<br/>BEFORE CRUMB CAME IN,

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:14.049
BUT CRUMB WAS<br/>THE IGNITION POINT,

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:15.269
AND WHEN I SAW<br/>MY FIRST ZAP COMIC,

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.229
I KNEW, WELL, THIS IS NOT<br/>LIKE COMMERCIAL ART,

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.239
BECAUSE YOU CAN DO<br/>AS YOU PLEASE,

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.149
BUT NOT ONLY THAT,

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.099
WE ALL HAD SOME CONNECTION<br/>WITH THE EARLIER DRUG CULTURE

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.089
PRIOR TO THE VIETNAM WAR,

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.149
SO WE WERE JUST A BROTHERHOOD<br/>IMMEDIATELY,

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:34.279
AND STARTED UNDERGROUND COMICS.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:39.289
NOW, ONE OF THE GREATEST<br/>ALTERNATIVE ARTISTS OF OUR TIME

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.099
THAT THESE MUSEUMS<br/>WOULD FIGHT FOR

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.999
IS ROBERT CRUMB, SEE?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.179
THE CHICKENS ARE GOING<br/>TO COME HOME TO ROOST,

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.169
APPARENTLY, YOU KNOW?

00:14:49.170 --> 00:15:00.189
[♪♪♪]

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:04.169
[WILLIAMS]: SO ROTH<br/>WENT OUT OF BUSINESS IN 1970,

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.039
AND SO I HAD A STOCK<br/>OF OIL PAINTINGS,

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.259
AND I JUST STARTED<br/>SELLING OIL PAINTINGS,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:12.099
AND I'VE BEEN A PROFESSIONAL<br/>OIL PAINTER SINCE 1970,

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.229
SO THERE'S STILL<br/>THIS ENORMOUS ART WORLD

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.119
THAT DOES<br/>ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM,

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.009
AND I DO THESE LURID PAINTINGS

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.259
AND NAKED WOMEN AND FANTASIES<br/>AND WHATNOT,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.279
AND NO GALLERY WILL TAKE ME,<br/>YOU KNOW,

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.029
AND NO FOUNDATIONS,<br/>NO MUSEUMS...

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:33.279
I HAVE NO PEER GROUP.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.069
AT SOME POINT,<br/>PEOPLE IN THE ART COMMUNITY

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.209
DOWN AT THE LAGUNA ART MUSEUM

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.169
SAW THE ADVANTAGE OF DOING<br/>A THING

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.189
CALLED THE KUSTOM KULTURE SHOW.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.169
[NASON]: IT FEATURED<br/>WHAT WE CALL THE HOLY TRINITY,

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.259
AND THAT WOULD BE<br/>BIG DADDY ROTH, VON DUTCH,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.189
AND ROBERT WILLIAMS,

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.209
BUT IT ALSO INCLUDED<br/>A LOT OF THE OTHER ARTISTS

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:52.219
WHO WERE IMPORTANT,

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.169
LIKE THE PIZZ WAS IN THAT SHOW,

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.139
ANTHONY AUSGANG,

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.239
STANLEY MOUSE,

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.239
AND SANDOW BURK.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.189
[♪♪♪]

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.009
IF YOU LOOK BACK<br/>ON THE 20th CENTURY

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.099
AND HAD TO THINK OF THE ONE ICON<br/>THAT BEST REPRESENTS IT,

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.249
I PERSONALLY THINK

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.089
IT WOULD BE SOME SORT<br/>OF CARTOON,

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.179
LIKE POSSIBLY, YOU KNOW,<br/>ALFRED E. NEWMAN'S FACE

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:22.049
OR MICKEY MOUSE,<br/>OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:25.069
[THE PIZZ]:<br/>IT WAS A CARTOON WORLD FOR ME.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.149
YOU KNOW, ANY CARTOON<br/>THAT WAS ON TV,

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.029
WE ALL WATCHED CARTOONS,

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.219
AND I WAS LOOKING AT<br/>SOME OLD MADs THE OTHER WEEK,

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.229
AND I REALIZED<br/>HOW INGRAINED IT IS,

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:38.149
HOW EVERY FRAME<br/>IS PACKED FULL OF STUFF.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.049
THAT'S ONE THING<br/>THAT LOWBROW HAS

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.169
IS IT'S NARRATIVE.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.279
IT'S ALWAYS A NARRATIVE.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.009
THERE'S ALWAYS<br/>A NARRATIVE PUNCH.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:45.139
SOMETHING'S GOING ON,

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.009
SOMETHING'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN,

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:48.199
OR SOMETHING'S JUST HAPPENED.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.059
VERY RARELY<br/>DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.059
THAT'S A STILLBORN<br/>AND JUST LAYS THERE.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.059
THERE'S A LOT OF DYNAMICS.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.049
THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF MOVING.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.169
IT GOES RIGHT TO THE JUGULAR,

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:03.149
AND GOING BACK<br/>TO THE OLD MAD MAGAZINE CLAIM,

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.149
YOU KNOW,<br/>"HUMOUR IN A JUGULAR VEIN."

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.999
[WILLIAMS]:<br/>SO YOU'VE GOT THESE EMOTIONS,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.149
ALL THESE ODD EMOTIONS<br/>OF ABSTRACT FEELING

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.129
THAT YOU JUST SAY<br/>"WELL, THAT'S HUMOUR."

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.089
SEE?

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:16.999
WELL, IF YOU HAVE TO JUST<br/>SAY "HUMOUR," OKAY,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.189
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE<br/>SOME PRETTY DARK HUMOUR.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:44.179
[♪♪♪]

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.079
[I, BRAINEATER]: I CAN REMEMBER<br/>BEING IN AMSTERDAM,

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.199
AND THE BIGGEST THING YOU SEE<br/>IS ALL THIS COWBOY CULTURE,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.269
FROM POSTERS, THE SHOES,<br/>AND EVERYTHING LIKE THIS.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.159
EUROPEANS CAN'T DO IT.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.139
THEY'RE AN OLD LAND.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.159
THEY'RE IN THE LAND OF DYSTOPIA.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.999
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN LOOKING<br/>FOR THE NEW ARCADIA.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.049
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN LOOKING<br/>FOR THIS NEW MAGIC LAND.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.119
THIS IS THE MAGIC LAND.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.009
THE WEST COAST.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.099
IT SAYS "DO WHAT YOU WANNA.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.029
"DON'T STOMP ON OTHERS TOO MUCH.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.159
LIVE. PROSPER."<br/>ALMOST A STAR-TREKKY THING.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.169
FROM STAR TREK TO TIKI,<br/>IT'S HERE.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:14.029
[♪♪♪]

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.249
DURING THE 1950s AND EARLY '60s,

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.999
A LOT OF TIKI-THEMED<br/>POLYNESIAN RESTAURANTS

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.099
AND TAVERNS AND BARS<br/>WERE ACROSS THE U.S.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.039
TRADER VIC'S,<br/>DON THE BEACHCOMBER,

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.159
AND A LOT OF IT CAME FROM

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.009
THE BOYS COMING BACK<br/>FROM THE PACIFIC

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.069
THAT WERE STATIONED<br/>OUT THERE DURING WORLD WAR II,

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:34.029
THEY GREW TO LOVE<br/>THE POLYNESIAN DECOR

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.259
AND THESE TIKI IDOLS

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.279
THAT WERE KIND OF OMNIPRESENT<br/>THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE PACIFIC,

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.129
BUT THERE'S ALSO<br/>THIS WHOLE NEW SCHOOL OF, SAY,

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.069
THE NEWBROW OR LOWBROW ARTISTS

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:45.079
THAT ARE DRAWING<br/>UPON THIS IMAGERY

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.069
AND USING IT QUITE A BIT<br/>IN THEIR ART,

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:55.259
AND THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL<br/>SUCCESSFUL TIKI ART SHOWS.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.149
[12 MIDNITE]:<br/>THE WHOLE TIKI CULTURE

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.239
HAS THE SAME ORIGINS<br/>WHERE THE LOWBROW CULTURE IS,

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.199
IT'S BROUGHT BACK<br/>WITH THE SERVICEMEN,

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.259
THE SAME PEOPLE<br/>THAT BROUGHT BACK THE FREEDOM

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.159
THAT THEY FELT<br/>FROM FLYING JET PLANES

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.049
AND TOOK IT<br/>TO RIDING MOTORBIKES,

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:11.009
THE SAME PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.269
MAYBE THEN WANTED THEIR OWN<br/>LITTLE BACKYARD TAHITI.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:21.079
IT COULD BE THE WHOLE "GAUGUIN<br/>OFF TO TAHITI" THING

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:25.099
WHERE WE'RE ALL FASCINATED<br/>BY OTHER LANDS, OTHER WORLDS,

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.209
AND A BETTER LIFE,

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:31.119
A LAND OF SUNSHINE<br/>AND CARNAL DESIRES.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.009
FOR ME, I WENT TO DISNEYLAND,<br/>AND I WAS, LIKE,

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.159
I WANT TO LIVE IN DISNEYLAND.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.229
THE ENCHANTED TIKI ROOM,

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.059
WELL, I WANTED TO, YOU KNOW,

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.259
I WANTED TO LIVE<br/>IN THE TIKI ROOM,

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.049
SO WHEN I ACTUALLY GOT TO WORK<br/>WITH DISNEYLAND, YOU KNOW,

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:48.239
I WAS HONOURED<br/>TO BE ABLE TO DO IT.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.999
WE LOOK BACK, WE TIE BACK<br/>THE TIKI, THE WEST COAST,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.039
THE BAD BOY IMAGE<br/>IN SOME OF THIS,

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.119
THE CRAZED GIRLS,<br/>THE CRAZED MONSTERS...

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.279
IT WAS FREEDOM.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.149
IT WAS A LAST CHANCE TO BE FREE,

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:59.259
AND RIGHT NOW,

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.279
IF WE DID WHAT<br/>WE WERE SUPPOSED TO AS ARTISTS,

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.019
GOOD GOD, I'D HAVE TO, LIKE,<br/>PROBABLY CHEW CHUNKS OF WOOD,

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.109
SPIT THEM OUT ON THE FLOOR,

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.269
AND HAVE SOMEONE SIT IN IT,

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:11.049
AND WE CALL IT SOME GREAT<br/>CONCEPTUAL FORM OF ART

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:12.099
THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED<br/>TO THINK ABOUT.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.189
POOEY ON THAT.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:17.209
I LIKE CONCEPTUAL ART<br/>IN ITS CONCEPTION.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:24.119
THE CONCEPTUALIST CREDO<br/>IS EXACTLY WHAT DUCHAMP SAID,

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.289
THE TIME WILL COME<br/>WHEN AN ARTIST,

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.189
ALL HE HAS TO DO IS POINT<br/>TO SOMETHING AND PREDICATE,

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:28.129
THAT IS ART.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.089
FOR FOUR DECADES,

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:32.039
YOU'VE GOT AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT<br/>OF ARTISTS

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.099
THAT HAVE GONE<br/>THROUGH ART SCHOOL

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:37.069
THAT CAN'T DRAW.<br/>ABSOLUTELY CANNOT DRAW.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.179
AND TAKE PRIDE IN IT,

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.029
AND FEEL THAT PEOPLE<br/>WHO CAN DRAW ARE ILLUSTRATORS,

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.239
AND THEY CAN ALWAYS<br/>HIRE AN ILLUSTRATOR

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:47.249
TO DO THEIR WORK<br/>IF THEY NEED A DRAWING, SEE.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.109
CONCEPTUALISM BROUGHT<br/>A WONDERFUL THING

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.199
TO THE PLAYING FIELD,

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.009
AND THAT IS INTELLIGENT THOUGHT,

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:57.069
BUT IT'S LIKE BEING<br/>A GREAT COMPOSER

00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:02.009
THAT CAN'T PLAY THE PIANO.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.189
IN THE BEGINNING OF MANKIND,

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:07.239
THERE IS A PRIMAL REAL URGE<br/>TO TELL A STORY.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.249
IT'S SUCH A BASIC FACTOR,<br/>YOU KNOW,

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.079
THERE'S ALL THESE<br/>ANCIENT CULTURES,

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.209
WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT 'EM

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:16.089
EXCEPT THAT THEY LEFT<br/>CAVE PAINTINGS,

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.199
THAT THERE'S ART LEFT<br/>THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE INTO.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.049
SO THAT'S SO BASIC,

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:24.279
SO AS ART AND PEOPLE<br/>WENT ALONG SIDE BY SIDE

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.279
AND WE HAD VARIOUS<br/>CIVILIZATIONS,

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.039
THEY HAD DIFFERENT<br/>ART STYLES AND STUFF,

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.239
IT'S A LIVING,<br/>BREATHING LANGUAGE

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.079
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO<br/>WITH VERBAL COMMUNICATION.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.099
IT'S ALL VISUAL,<br/>CEREBRAL CORTEX,

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.179
AND A LOT OF IT DEFIES LOGIC,

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.279
AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE,

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.109
ART CRAWLED UP ITS OWN ASS<br/>AND YOU NEEDED AN INTERPRETER,

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.229
AND IT TURNED INTO<br/>LIKE THE CHURCH

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.019
WHERE YOU NEEDED THE CLERGY

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.999
TO EXPLAIN THE HIGH TEXTS<br/>OF THE CHURCH,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.179
WELL, YOU NEEDED THE CLERGY,<br/>THE ART CRITICS

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:56.039
TO EXPLAIN WHAT WAS BEING<br/>PUT OUT IN THE CHURCH OF ART,

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.239
WHICH WOULD BE THE MUSEUMS.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.229
I THINK THE PROBLEM<br/>WITH SOME FORMS OF MODERN ART

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:05.169
SUCH AS MINIMALISM<br/>AND CONCEPTUALISM

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.169
IS THAT IF THE AUDIENCE MEMBER

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:10.069
DOESN'T HAVE<br/>SOME ART HISTORY TRAINING

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.279
OR SOME REFERENCE POINTS,

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.179
THEY'RE NOT ABLE<br/>TO UNDERSTAND THE PIECE

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.169
WITHOUT READING<br/>AN ARTIST'S STATEMENT,

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:18.269
'CAUSE THERE'S SO LITTLE<br/>IN THE WORK.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.139
TO LOOK<br/>AT A JACKSON POLLACK PAINTING

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.249
FROM A LOWBROW STANDPOINT,

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.119
YOU'RE JUST LOOKING<br/>AT THESE MAD SPLATTERS

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.269
THAT'S GOING ON.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.099
THE HIGHBROW APPROACH TO IT<br/>IS THAT,

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.039
YOU KNOW,<br/>WHAT DO THESE DRIPS MEAN,

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.069
AND WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.029
THE THING THAT'S REPELLENT<br/>ABOUT LOWBROW

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.129
IS THAT IT REALLY<br/>BLITZKRIEGS THE IDEA

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.239
THAT HIGH CULTURE REQUIRES

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.109
A CERTAIN LEVEL<br/>OF INTELLIGENCE,

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.249
SOMETHING THAT'S LEARNED,

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:43.219
SO I THINK IT'S<br/>A FEAR OF THE SAVAGE,

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.279
YOU KNOW, IN A WEIRD WAY.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:50.069
THE ENTIRE ESTABLISHED ART WORLD<br/>IS JOINED TOGETHER

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.169
FROM ART SCHOOLS

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:54.169
TO THE FOUNDATIONS<br/>TO THE MUSEUMS.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:57.289
THEY'RE ALL INTERLINKED<br/>WITH EACH OTHER, SYSTEMATICALLY,

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:01.219
TO HELP PROMOTE STYLES<br/>THAT THEY EMBRACE.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.099
THERE SHOULD BE<br/>20 DIFFERENT KINDS OF ART.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.119
IT SHOULD BE<br/>AN OPEN PLAYING FIELD,

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.229
BUT IT ISN'T.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:09.119
THERE'S A LOT OF ANDY WARHOL<br/>POP ART

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.009
IN MUSEUMS ALL OVER THE PLACE,

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:12.199
BUT THERE'S... I DON'T THINK<br/>THERE'S ANY LOWBROW

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.159
IN ANY PERMANENT COLLECTIONS.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.049
[I, BRAINEATER]:<br/>WELL, I THINK WHAT HAPPENS

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.269
WITH THE HIGHBROW ART GALLERIES,

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:20.269
BASICALLY THEY'RE STAFFED<br/>AND MANNED BY A GANG OF PEOPLE

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.189
THAT HAVE BEEN, QUOTE,<br/>I SUPPOSE, CRITICALLY TRAINED

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.059
AT THE UNIVERSITY, QUOTE,

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.169
TO HAVE THE CERTAIN JOBS

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:27.249
LIKE CURATORS<br/>AND STUFF LIKE THIS.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.269
THEY'RE A CLOSED SHOP.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.289
THE REST OF US HAVE BEEN<br/>SHUT OUT FOR DECADES,

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.079
AND PROBABLY FOREVER,

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.149
SO WE HAD TO CREATE<br/>OUR OWN SCENE,

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.099
AND YOU MIGHT THINK<br/>THAT AFTER 10, 20 YEARS,

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.249
YOU MIGHT SOMEHOW FLOW<br/>INTO THIS MAINSTREAM

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.179
AND BE ACCEPTED.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.169
NOT SO.<br/>NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.179
AT ONE POINT, I TOOK MY SLIDES<br/>TO AN ART GALLERY,

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.089
AND THE DEALER SAID, YOU KNOW,

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.079
I'LL ONLY GIVE YOU A SHOW<br/>IF YOU'LL SLEEP WITH ME,

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.039
WHICH I DIDN'T DO,<br/>SO I DIDN'T GET THE SHOW,

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.179
AND ANOTHER TIME, THEY SAID,

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.069
YOU KNOW,<br/>WE'LL LOOK AT YOUR SLIDES

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:57.179
IF YOU'LL BRING EVERYTHING<br/>FROM OUR TRUCK INSIDE,

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.179
SO BASICALLY TREATING ME<br/>LIKE SHIT

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.289
BECAUSE I WAS BRINGING IN<br/>THIS WORK

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:04.079
THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS A JOKE.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.029
AND THEN THIS LITTLE SCRUFFY<br/>MONGREL ART TYPE

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.169
AND THEN THIS LITTLE SCRUFFY<br/>MONGREL ART TYPE

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.229
CAME BACK OUT OF THE WOODWORK

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:12.219
AND PEOPLE STARTED<br/>PAYING ATTENTION TO IT.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:16.089
I THINK THAT'S WHY A LOT OF IT<br/>IS POO-POOED FROM, YOU KNOW,

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.059
THE ART COGNOSCENTI<br/>AND THEIR AVATARS IN NEW YORK,

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.229
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT NEEDED<br/>ANYMORE TO EXPLAIN SHIT,

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.179
YOU KNOW?

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.019
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.089
IT'S LIKE "THEY GET IT,<br/>SO WHAT'S MY JOB HERE?

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.209
WHAT'S MY FUNCTION?"

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:33.129
SO THEY'RE HANGING ON<br/>TO THEIR LAST THREADS.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:34.059
[AUSGANG]: THIS IS REAL.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.259
THIS IS A BATTLE,

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.149
AND I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT<br/>A ROY LICHTENSTEIN PAINTING,

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:41.149
YOU LOOK AT IT 10, 15 YEARS AGO,

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.179
I THINK IT STILL CARRIED<br/>THIS INCREDIBLE WEIGHT.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.999
LOWBROW ART HAS TAKEN<br/>THAT CARTOON LANGUAGE

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.009
AND SAID SOME INCREDIBLE<br/>STATEMENTS WITH IT

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:54.039
THAT MAKE HIM LOOK LIKE...<br/>TO ME, IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.019
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE AFRAID OF,<br/>IS THAT LOWBROW CAN ACTUALLY...

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.289
HAS THE ABILITY TO ERASE<br/>EARLIER CULTURAL STATEMENTS.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:06.009
IT'S POWERFUL,<br/>AND PEOPLE ARE SCARED OF THAT.

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.199
THE POWERS THAT BE IN THAT WORLD<br/>MAY DECIDE ONE DAY

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.059
THAT THIS IS<br/>AN IMPORTANT ART MOVEMENT

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.269
AND IT'S SOMETHING

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:42.189
THAT THEY NEED<br/>TO TAKE SERIOUSLY.

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:45.289
THERE HAS BEEN A REAL EMERGENCE<br/>OF WOMEN ARTISTS,

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:48.099
WHO HAVEN'T SUPERSEDED<br/>THE MALE ARTISTS,

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.069
BUT WHO HAVE DEFINITELY<br/>MADE THEIR PRESENCE FELT.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:57.049
ONCE THEY SAY "BOYS ONLY,"<br/>IT REALLY DOES SOMETHING TO ME.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.099
[PETRUCCI]:<br/>I THINK THAT THERE ARE THINGS

00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.239
IN THE POP CULTURE

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.199
THAT WOMEN CAN REFERENCE<br/>AND TAKE AS THEIR OWN,

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.109
AND A LOT OF THAT<br/>DOES HAVE TO DO

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:08.009
WITH SEXUALLY DRIVEN IMAGERY.

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.239
WE WERE SEEING MEN<br/>USING THE KIND OF IMAGERY

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.289
THAT WE WERE, LIKE, WELL,<br/>THAT'S A PAINTING OF A WOMAN,

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:14.199
AND I'M A WOMAN,

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.099
AND I THINK I'M BETTER QUALIFIED<br/>TO PAINT A WOMAN THAN YOU ARE,

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.119
AND I THINK I CAN PROBABLY PAINT<br/>A BETTER WOMAN THAN YOU CAN,

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.079
AND I'M GOING TO TRY,

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.099
AND THEN THERE'S A CERTAIN<br/>ACCEPTANCE IN THAT, TOO.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.029
I THINK IT'S BEEN REALLY GREAT<br/>FOR WOMEN.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.239
I THINK THE WHOLE LOWBROW THING<br/>IS PROBABLY MORE OPEN TO WOMEN

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:37.159
THAN ALMOST ANY ART MOVEMENT<br/>IN HISTORY SO FAR.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.159
THE INTERNET,<br/>IT'S OPENED UP A LOT OF DOORS.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.129
PEOPLE THAT PREVIOUSLY COULD<br/>FIND OUT ABOUT ART

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.219
NOW HAVE GREATER ACCESS<br/>TO ALL KINDS OF ART,

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.079
AND AS A RESULT,

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.099
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO MORE<br/>TOWARDS WHAT THEY LIKE

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.009
AND THEIR AESTHETIC

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.049
AS OPPOSED TO GOING WITH ART<br/>THAT PEOPLE TELL THEM IS GOOD.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.239
WITH THE INTERNET,

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.199
THAT JUST BROUGHT THE AWARENESS<br/>TO A POINT

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:00.019
WHERE PEOPLE STARTED MAKING IT<br/>HAPPEN IN THEIR CITIES,

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.109
YOU KNOW,

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:04.069
FROM PHILADELPHIA TO CHICAGO<br/>TO NEW YORK.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.279
ALL OF A SUDDEN,<br/>WE'RE NO LONGER BEING STOPPED

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.189
GETTING TO THE PEOPLE

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:11.039
WHO ACTUALLY<br/>MIGHT REALLY ENJOY OUR WORK.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.139
[NAILOR]: SO I THINK CURATORS

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.019
ARE GOING TO PLAY<br/>A LESS IMPORTANT ROLE,

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.279
AS WILL GALLERY OWNERS,

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.159
IN DETERMINING THE FUTURE<br/>OF WHAT PEOPLE PURCHASE,

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.129
AND PEOPLE WILL MAKE BETTER<br/>SINGLE-MINDED DECISIONS

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:26.049
BASED ON WHAT THEY LIKE.

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:27.139
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.259
IS THE ARTIST'S<br/>AUDIENCE INTERACTION,

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.199
AND I'M TOTALLY GRATEFUL

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.079
THAT PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED<br/>IN MY WORK.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.079
[PRESSMAN]:<br/>IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS,

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.289
YOU CAN'T GO OUT

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:37.239
AND MEET ALL YOUR FAVOURITE<br/>MUSICIANS, PARTICULARLY,

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.079
BUT IN LOWBROW ART,

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.239
YOU CAN ACTUALLY<br/>SEE ALL THE ARTISTS AT ART SHOWS

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.149
AND TALK TO THEM,<br/>AND GET TO KNOW THEM A LITTLE.

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.169
IT ADDS A LOT TO THE ACTUAL ART,

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.009
KNOWING WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE<br/>THEY ARE.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.279
[AUSGANG]: TO ME, IT'S<br/>A CAMARADERIE OF SUBVERSION,

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.099
REALLY,

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.049
AND WE'RE TRYING<br/>TO SUBVERT SOMETHING,

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:55.179
WHETHER ONE IS AN ARTIST

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.159
OR ONE IS A MEMBER<br/>OF AN AUDIENCE.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.229
YOU'RE STILL ENGAGED IN THIS,<br/>LIKE, ALMOST A MILITARY ACTION

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:03.189

NEW YORK<br/>AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:16.039
INHERITED<br/>THE CORONET OF FINE ART

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.219
FROM EUROPE,<br/>AND ESPECIALLY FRANCE,

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:23.069
AND THIS WAS BASICALLY DUE<br/>TO ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISTS, SEE?

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:27.029
THE FRESH, NEW CAPITAL<br/>OF THE WORLD IS NEW YORK.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.189
NEW YORK HAS ALWAYS<br/>PRIDED ITSELF ON SOPHISTICATION,

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.249
YOU KNOW, WHICH MEANS<br/>CONSTIPATION.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.219
LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:41.009
HAVE THE QUALITY<br/>OF BEING ON THE PACIFIC RIM

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:43.279
AND BEING THOUSANDS OF MILES<br/>AWAY FROM NEW YORK

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.249
AND OWING ALMOST NOTHING<br/>TO EUROPE.

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:50.159
YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE<br/>SUBCULTURAL ART FORMS

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.089
THAT ARE JUST CONTINUALLY<br/>BLOSSOMING, YOU KNOW?

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:57.219
YOU'VE GOT HOT RODS AND BIKERS<br/>AND SURFING AND SKATEBOARDS

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:02.089
AND TATTOOS AND COMIC BOOKS<br/>AND ESPECIALLY HOLLYWOOD

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.189
AND ALL THE EPHEMERA<br/>THAT SLIPPED OFF HOLLYWOOD,

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.239
AND IT'S ALL NEW AND EXCITING,

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:15.119
AND IT'S ALL INDIRECTLY<br/>OR DIRECTLY RELATED TO ART.

[WILLIAMS]: IN THE LATE '70s,

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.199
AN INTERESTING PHENOMENON<br/>HAPPENED,

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.049
THE SPONTANEOUS GENERATION<br/>OF PUNK ROCK.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:40.239
AS NIHILISTIC AS IT WAS,

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:45.079
THE VAST MAJORITY<br/>IF NOT ALL PUNK ROCK MUSICIANS

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.279
HAD FINE ARTS BACKGROUNDS.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:51.079
SO YOU HAD THIS YOUNG GENERATION<br/>OF BOHEMIANS

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.139
IN THIS PUNK ROCK WORLD.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.209
AT A CERTAIN POINT

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:59.279
UNTIL THE ART BEGAN<br/>TO CARVE AN IDENTITY OF ITS OWN,

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.009
I THINK IT WAS ANCILLARY<br/>TO MUSIC.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:06.269
IT WASN'T EVEN CALLED<br/>"LOWBROW ART."

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.159
[I, BRAINEATER]: IT WAS JUST,<br/>LIKE, DO IT YOURSELF.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.149
YOU DON'T NEED PERMISSION<br/>FOR ANYTHING, JUST DO IT,

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.049
AND THAT'S<br/>WHAT OUR GANG STARTED DOING,

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:16.009
AND THAT'S<br/>HOW WE CREATED THE SCENE,

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:18.109
BUT IT WAS REALLY CALLED

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.109
"IF YOU WANT TO DO IT,<br/>YOU DO IT YOURSELF,

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.179
"AND IF YOU'RE WAITING<br/>FOR SOMEONE TO LET YOU DO IT,

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:28.229

[AUSGANG]:<br/>IN RETROSPECT I REALIZE

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.039
THAT ONE OF<br/>THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.289
THAT LOWBROW ART<br/>GOT BROADCAST TO PEOPLE

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:37.269
WAS THROUGH FLYERS<br/>AND CD COVERS, RECORD COVERS,

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.259
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:44.019
WELL, I KNOW A LOT OF ARTISTS<br/>WHO KEPT FOOD ON THEIR TABLE

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:47.219
BY DOING RECORD COVERS<br/>AND FLYERS AND STUFF,

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:51.109
SO IN THAT SENSE, YOU KNOW,<br/>IT WAS IMPORTANT.

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:53.179
YEAH, I WAS IN BANDS.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:54.199
PART OF THE REASON<br/>I HAVE THE NAME "SHAG"

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.009
IS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.269
TO SIGN MY OWN NAME<br/>ON THE RECORD COVERS,

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:00.189
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT<br/>IT WOULD SEEM UNPROFESSIONAL

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:02.119
IF PEOPLE LOOKED AT THE RECORD<br/>AND THEY SAID

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.249
"HEY, THE GUITAR PLAYER<br/>DID THE ALBUM COVER!"

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:06.129
SO I HAD TO COME UP<br/>WITH A PSEUDONYM,

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.019
AND THAT'S WHERE "SHAG"<br/>CAME FROM.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.089
[AUSGANG]:<br/>AND YOU DO A PAINTING

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:10.279

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.229
HOW MANY PEOPLE<br/>ARE GOING TO SEE IT, RIGHT?

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.279
BUT WITH A CD OR A RECORD COVER,<br/>IT'S...

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.169

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:00.999
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY<br/>TO SKIN A CAT,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.059
AND THE SAME GOES<br/>FOR THE ART THING.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.179
IF YOU'RE GOING TO WORRY

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.009
ABOUT THOSE ART GALLERIES<br/>OUT THERE

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:06.149
THAT ARE GOING TO STICK<br/>THEIR NOSES UP IN THE AIR

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:07.209
WHEN YOU SHOW THEM<br/>WHAT YOU'VE GOT,

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:28.279
YOU'RE DOOMED.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.239
IN VANCOUVER IN THE 1980s,

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.059
THERE WAS KIND OF<br/>A PARALLEL SCENE

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.009
AS TO WHAT WAS GOING ON<br/>IN CALIFORNIA,

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:35.289
WITH THE D.I.Y.<br/>UNDERGROUND ART SCENE,

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:38.039
AND THE ESTABLISHED<br/>GALLERIES

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.259
WEREN'T REALLY INTERESTED<br/>IN WHAT WE WERE DOING,

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:42.239
SO THE ARTISTS BASICALLY<br/>HAD TO DO IT THEMSELVES.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.069
I WAS PAINTING<br/>IN MY KITCHEN  ONE DAY,

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:47.219
AND MY FRIEND, 12 MIDNITE,<br/>CAME OVER AND SAID

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.179
"OH, VICKI, I DIDN'T KNOW<br/>YOU WERE A PAINTER.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.169
I DIDN'T KNOW<br/>YOU WERE AN ARTIST,"

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:53.099
AND I SAID, "WELL, I'M NOT."

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.999
AND HE SAID,<br/>"OH, WELL, I THINK YOU ARE,"

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.999
SO WE'VE GOT A SHOW<br/>COMING UP NEXT MONTH

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.289
AND I'M GOING TO BE IN IT.

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.239
I FIRST GOT INTO ART<br/>AND THE LOCAL SCENE IN VANCOUVER

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.159
THROUGH THE BRAINEATERS,

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.179
PUNK ROCK AND ARTIST GROUP,<br/>THE BRAINEATERS,

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:13.179
AND THEY WERE DOING PERFORMANCE<br/>AS WELL AS ART SHOWS,

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:20.079
SO THAT KIND OF PIQUED<br/>MY INTEREST IN THE ART SCENE.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.229
THERE'S NEVER BEEN<br/>ANY TRADITIONAL GALLERIES

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:22.999
IN THIS CITY

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.279
THAT ARE REALLY<br/>FOR PEOPLE LIKE US.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.009
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS SOMEONE<br/>WOULD GET IN CHARGE

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:28.269
OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS ONE

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:30.019
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.199
EMILY CARR'S<br/>STUDENT GALLERY THING

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.069
CALLED THE HELEN PITT.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.189
WE'D SQUEEZE OURSELVES IN<br/>BETWEEN THE ART SCHOOL STUDENTS,

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:40.049
AND WE'D HAVE OUR SHOWS THERE<br/>WHEN WE COULD.

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:41.249
[STEEN]:<br/>AND THEN THE SMASH GALLERY

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.189
WAS DOING SOME SHOWS.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:46.099
I WAS ASKED TO BE<br/>IN THE FIRST SHOW.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:51.109
IT WAS A GROUP SHOW.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:53.189
I KIND OF FELL INTO IT<br/>ACCIDENTALLY

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.009
AND FOUND A PLACE

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:59.059
THAT WAS JUST TOO BIG<br/>TO BE JUST MY STUDIO.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.219
THEY WERE SHOWING<br/>A LOT OF COMIC BOOK ARTISTS

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.119
AND LOWBROW ARTISTS,

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.019
YOU KNOW, THEY HAD ALREADY SORT<br/>OF HOOKED INTO THAT WHOLE SCENE,

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:08.009
ALTHOUGH AT THAT TIME,<br/>IT WASN'T CLASSIFIED AS LOWBROW.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:10.139
[12 MIDNITE]:<br/>WELL, THE MOST FAMOUS ARTISTS

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:13.279
WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BEEN THOSE<br/>INVOLVED IN THE MISFIT LIT SHOW.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.189
RALPH STEADMAN,<br/>DAVID SANDLIN,

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:18.289
DAN CLOWES, DAVID BOSWELL<br/>THAT DOES REID FLEMING...

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:22.199
JUST EVERYBODY THAT WAS LINKED<br/>WITH FANTAGRAPHICS AT THE TIME.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:26.209
PEOPLE SAW COMIC BOOK PANELS<br/>OR ALBUMS COVERS, WHATEVER,

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:33.059
THE ORIGINAL ART ON THE WALLS<br/>AS ART.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.219
IT'S AFTER THAT<br/>WHERE WE FORMED THE POP TARTS,

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:39.009
AND SO WE STARTED<br/>DOING REGULAR SHOWS ALSO.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:41.029
[STEEN]: ZULU RECORDS DECIDED

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.269
TO LET US USE THE SPACE<br/>IN THE BACK OF THE STORE

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:49.999
TO HAVE SOME SHOWS<br/>AND TO SET UP SHOP.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.249
[VICKI M]: BECAUSE<br/>WE WERE CALLED THE POP TARTS,

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:54.279
WE DECIDED TO CALL IT<br/>TART GALLERY.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.129
WE HAD ABOUT 20-ODD SHOWS

00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:00.999
OVER THE YEAR AND A HALF<br/>THAT WE WERE THERE,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.149
AND WE HAD A ROSTER<br/>OF 150 ARTISTS.

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:07.049
A LOT OF THEM<br/>WERE LOCAL AND UP AND COMERS,

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:08.269
BUT WE ALSO HAD<br/>QUITE A FEW ARTISTS

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:09.999
FROM THE STATES.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.089
IT WAS A GREAT PLACE<br/>TO SHOW ART,

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.249
AND WE INTRODUCED<br/>A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:16.159
WHO WERE PROBABLY INTIMIDATED

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.249
BY GOING INTO SOME OF<br/>THE COMMERCIAL GALLERIES,

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.239
THEY WOULD COME IN<br/>AND COME TO OUR SHOWS

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:25.269
AND DRINK BEER AND BUY ART<br/>AT VERY REASONABLE PRICES,

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.249
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS<br/>PART OF OUR WHOLE DEAL.

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:29.189
WE WANTED TO, YOU KNOW,

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:32.099
BE ACCESSIBLE<br/>TO JUST THE REGULAR PERSON.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:36.189
[STEEN]: THROUGH CONNECTIONS<br/>TO A GALLERY IN SEATTLE,

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.079
ROQ LA RUE,

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.219
WE MET LISA PETRUCCI,

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:42.179
AND WE ALSO KNEW<br/>SHERRI CULLISON.

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.239
SHERRI GAVE US A CALL<br/>AND ASKED US FOR AN INTERVIEW

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.149
FOR THIS BOOK THAT SHE WAS DOING<br/>ON THE LADIES OF LOWBROW.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:51.289
WE DIDN'T EXPECT IT<br/>EXACTLY TO COME OUT,

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:55.169
AND WE ALSO DIDN'T EXPECT IT<br/>TO BE AS BEAUTIFUL AS IT WAS.

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:56.999
[VICKI M]:<br/>THERE WAS A LOT OF SHOWS

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.089
THAT WERE ASSOCIATED<br/>WITH THE BOOK.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:02.119
THERE WAS VANCOUVER, TORONTO,<br/>WE HAD TWO SHOWS IN L.A.,

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:07.019
UM, BUT IT ALSO KIND OF<br/>SNOWBALLED FROM THERE,

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.149
AND WE ENDED UP DOING

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:10.129
THE SCI-FI WESTERN SHOW<br/>IN SAN FRANCISCO,

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:12.239
WHICH WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT<br/>SHOW TO BE IN.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.149
THERE WAS A LOT OF ARTISTS<br/>FROM ALL OVER THE STATES,

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:17.279
THEY PUT OUT A CATALOGUE,

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:21.059
IT'S PUBLISHED BY LAST GASP<br/>IN SAN FRANCISCO.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.059
I THINK THE BOOK<br/>WAS A REAL TURNING POINT.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:26.029
AFTER THAT, WE WERE INCLUDED<br/>IN MANY GROUP SHOWS.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:29.029
ROQ LA RUE, COPRO NASON,

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:31.199
LA LUZ DE JESUS GALLERY,

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.999
C-POP GALLERY IN DETROIT,

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.269
SHOOTING GALLERY<br/>IN SAN FRANCISCO,

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:38.219
FUSE GALLERY IN NEW YORK ...

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.199
WE HAVE SOME SHOWS COMING UP<br/>ON THE EAST COAST THIS YEAR,

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.149
CHICAGO, NEW YORK, AND MONTREAL,

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:46.259
SO THAT'S PRETTY EXCITING.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.019
[12 MIDNITE]: FELLOW ARTISTS<br/>LIKE HOLLY AND NICOLE STEEN,

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.169
VICKI MURDOCH AND I

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:52.069
DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:54.029
IF WE COULD GO

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:58.049
AND TAKE A SHOW OF ARTWORK<br/>TO THE STATES.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:59.129
[STEEN]:<br/>BASICALLY GOT IN THE IMPALA

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.199
WITH A BUNCH OF PAINTINGS

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.059
AND WENT DOWN TO AUSTIN,

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.189
AND FROM THERE WE WENT<br/>TO LA LUZ DE JESUS

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:05.029
IN CALIFORNIA, IN LOS ANGELES,

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:06.239
AND THEN WE WENT ON TO FRESNO,

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.019
SO WE DID, LIKE,<br/>A THREE-CITY TOUR.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.079
[12 MIDNITE]:<br/>WE'RE NOT AMERICANS,

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.159
BUT WE HAVE SIMILARITIES<br/>WITH AMERICA,

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.049
OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS<br/>TO THE SOUTH.

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:16.219
WE ALSO HAVE<br/>DIFFERENT POLITICAL VIEWS,

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:19.219
AND I THINK THAT<br/>THAT WAS SHOWN IN THE SHOW.

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:22.219
DIFFERENT AESTHETIC IDEALS,<br/>AND DIFFERENT POLITICAL VIEWS.

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:28.059
THREE ENGINES LATER, HERE I AM.

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.219
[VICKI M]: THE SUMMER OF 2003,

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.289
12 MIDNITE OPENED<br/>THE NEW TINY GALLERY

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:36.269
IN THE HEART OF CHINATOWN<br/>IN VANCOUVER.

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:39.019
IT'S PROBABLY THE SMALLEST<br/>ART GALLERY IN THE WORLD.

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.149
BASICALLY, AS BIG<br/>AS YOUR BEDROOM PROBABLY IS.

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.089
BUT IT'S A GALLERY,<br/>AND HE HAS SHOWS THERE,

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:45.139
AND PEOPLE BUY THERE,<br/>AND IT HAPPENS THERE,

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:48.029
AND THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT,<br/>IT'S HAPPENING AND TAKING PLACE.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:53.149
NEW TINY IS TINY,<br/>BUT WE'VE HAD SOME GREAT SHOWS.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:55.189
WORK FROM EVERYONE FROM,<br/>YOU KNOW,

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:57.239
COOP AND KOZIK<br/>AND KALYNN CAMPBELL,

00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:02.059

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:05.239
ANDREA TUCKER, PILAR...

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.129
WE'VE GOT THE BRAINEATER.

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:08.239
JUST EVERYBODY.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:13.239
WE'VE SHOWN<br/>PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.029
[DIRTY DONNY]:<br/>THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD ARTISTS

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:16.259
COMING OUT OF CANADA.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.259
THERE'S A LOT OF SHOWS<br/>GOING ON THERE.

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.249
YOU'VE GOT GUYS<br/>LIKE DARREN MARINUK,

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.199
THERE'S GUYS LIKE DRAZEN<br/>FROM TORONTO,

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.249
WHO'S JUST DONE<br/>A LOT OF ROCK AND ROLL ART,

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:26.059
ALBUM COVERS, POSTERS,

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.289
PAT HAMOU,<br/>THE GUY'S DONE, LIKE,

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:29.069
THOUSANDS OF POSTERS<br/>FOR MONTREAL

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.229
FROM THE '80s<br/>ALL THE WAY UP TILL NOW.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:33.259
THERE'S DAVE COOPER FROM OTTAWA,<br/>WHO'S BLOWING UP.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.139
HIS STUFF'S EVERYWHERE.

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.039
U.S., CANADA, JUST EVERYWHERE.

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.139
BUT YEAH, CANADA'S ART SCENE<br/>IS REALLY GOOD,

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.259
AND I THINK IT GETS OVERLOOKED.

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.049
[VICKI M]: WE JUST DON'T HAVE<br/>THE POPULATION HERE

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:45.219
TO SUPPORT

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.139
ALL THE CREATIVE PEOPLE<br/>THAT WE HAVE,

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.239
AND PEOPLE NEED<br/>TO GO TO THE STATES

00:38:48.240 --> 00:39:10.269
TO GET THE RECOGNITION AND FAME.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:12.199
[GIARLA]:<br/>THIS WHOLE LOWBROW MOVEMENT

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.279
REALLY KIND OF TOOK SPARK<br/>AND BLEW UP

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.179
DUE TO THE FACT THAT I THINK,

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:20.239
REALLY, BILLY SHIRE OPENED UP<br/>THE LUZ DE JESUS GALLERY

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:24.099
ABOVE THE SOAP PLANT ON MELROSE,

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.169
AND STARTED SHOWING<br/>THESE ARTISTS

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:27.139
THAT HE FELT WAS FINE ART.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.069
IT WASN'T LOWBROW,<br/>THIS WAS FINE ART,

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:30.189
AND IT DID DESERVE WHITE WALLS.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:32.239
[SHIRE]: 1986.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.289
IT STARTED TOTALLY BY ACCIDENT.

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:40.089
A LOT OF IT IS AN OUTGROWTH<br/>OF THE STORES THAT I DO,

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:42.179
WACKO AND SOAP PLANT,

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:46.199
WHICH ARE ALL<br/>KIND OF POP CULTURE RELATED.

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.229
I STARTED DOING DAY OF THE DEAD

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:54.049
AND ARTISTS THAT WERE DOING<br/>KIND OF A POP FOLK ART...

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:56.259
IT SORT OF JUST KIND OF<br/>KEPT ON ROLLING ON

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.109
TO DIFFERENT THINGS

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:01.079
WHERE I HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS<br/>THAT WERE ARTISTS,

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.089
AND THEY WEREN'T BEING SHOWN,

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:05.249
PEOPLE LIKE ROBERT WILLIAMS

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.249
AND GARY PANTER,

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:12.029
AND WE JUST KEPT ON GOING.

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:24.019
[♪♪♪]

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.999
I THINK JUXTAPOZ STARTED<br/>PARTIALLY OUT OF NECESSITY,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.269
BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:33.029
CONVENTIONALLY ASSOCIATE<br/>GOOD ART

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:34.289
WITH THE EAST COAST,<br/>ESPECIALLY NEW YORK CITY,

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:36.129
AND ROBERT WILLIAMS,

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:38.209
WHO WAS A PAINTER<br/>BASED IN CALIFORNIA,

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:43.249
FELT THAT THERE WAS<br/>SORT OF A DEARTH OF RECOGNITION

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:45.149
FOR ARTWORK ON THE WEST COAST.

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.179
IT TARGETS A VERY SPECIFIC<br/>KIND OF ARTWORK

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.119
THAT OTHER MAGAZINES IN THE PAST

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.109
MAY HAVE FOUND<br/>TO BE TOO UNTRADITIONAL,

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:53.249
TOO CONTROVERSIAL,

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:56.999
TOO KIND OF IN YOUR FACE<br/>AND GRAPHIC,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.049
BUT THAT THERE IS STILL<br/>A HUGE FAN BASE FOR.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:01.189
[SAMARAS]:<br/>I GET MAIL FROM PEOPLE

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:03.119
IN FAR-FLUNG PARTS<br/>OF THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.099
WHO WOULD HAVE NO OTHER ACCESS

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:08.039
TO THE FACT THAT THIS STUFF<br/>IS GOING ON

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:14.009
IF JUXTAPOZ DIDN'T EXIST.

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.199
IT'S KIND OF THIS IRONIC COMEDY

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.039
WHERE, LIKE, I CAN SIT DOWN<br/>AT A TATTOO SHOW OR BOOK SIGNING

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.219
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS ME.

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.269
I GET STOPPED BY PEOPLE<br/>ON THE STREET.

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:25.099
THEY'VE SEEN ME ON TV.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.249
"HEY, I SAW YOU<br/>ON MONSTER GARAGE!"

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:29.049
DIFFERENT STATES,<br/>DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:31.069
I'VE WALKED DOWN<br/>THE GINZA DISTRICT IN JAPAN,

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:33.119
AND I'VE HEARD MY NAME WHISPERED<br/>AS I WALKED BY.

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.279
I WAS LIKE THE SECOND COMING.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.119
SO AS FAR AS BEING KNOWN,<br/>INFAMOUS, WHATEVER,

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.179
IT'S INTERNATIONAL,<br/>IT'S HUGE, YOU KNOW,

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:46.069
BUT THAT AND 50 CENTS<br/>WILL GET ME A CUP OF COFFEE.

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.249
[SHIRE]: PEOPLE ASK ME<br/>ALL THE TIME, YOU KNOW,

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:52.219
"WELL, YOU KNOW, IS IT GOING<br/>TO BE WORTH MORE IN VALUE?"

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:58.279
AND I DON'T REALLY EVEN WANT<br/>TO TALK TO PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:03.109
OBVIOUSLY, SOME OF THE PEOPLE<br/>THAT I'VE SHOWN, YOU KNOW,

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:05.119
AND, YOU KNOW, BOUGHT WORK FROM,

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:11.139
HAS INCREASED<br/>10, 20, 30, 40 TIMES.

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.189
I WENT TO A SHOW IN 1981.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:15.179
THE PAINTINGS WERE $1,400<br/>FOR BIG PAINTINGS.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.159
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.279
THE GREATEST MASTERPIECES<br/>THAT ARE COMING OUT

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.119
ARE COMING OUT RIGHT NOW,

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.189
AND PEOPLE ARE PAYING UP TO,<br/>YOU KNOW,

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:24.059
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS<br/>FOR A PAINTING.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:26.179
I MEAN, MARK RYDEN JUST HAD<br/>A PAINTING AT A MUSEUM

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:30.099
THAT WENT FOR, YOU KNOW,<br/>HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.179
THAT COULD PROVE<br/>TO BE A GREAT DEAL,

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:35.149
'CAUSE SALVADOR DALI<br/>IN THE LATE '50s,

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:37.259
HE'D SELL A PAINTING FOR $3,000,

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.159
AND THEN BY THE MID '60s,

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.159
THEY WERE GOING FOR, YOU KNOW,<br/>MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.159
SO I THINK IF PEOPLE ARE PAYING<br/>HALF A MILLION DOLLARS

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.079
FOR A PAINTING NOW,

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.239
FOR, SAY, A MARK RYDEN PAINTING,

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.109
MAYBE THEY'LL BE WORTH<br/>FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:51.059
IN A COUPLE OF YEARS.

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:54.119
YOU TAKE ARTISTS LIKE<br/>MARK RYDEN, SHAG, TIM BISKUP,

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.999
A LOT OF THE GREAT ARTISTS<br/>FROM CANADA AS WELL AS THE U.S.,

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.079
THE GROWTH IN VALUE<br/>OF THE PAINTINGS

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.139
HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL.

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:05.259
I AM NOW WHERE I'M AT THE SECOND<br/>OR THIRD BIGGEST GALLERY

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.249
IN NEW YORK,

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.179
TONY SHAFRAZI, SEE,

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:13.009
AND I'VE ACTUALLY STEPPED<br/>INTO THE BLUE CHIP WORLD,

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:16.079
BUT I'M AT THE VERY BOTTOM<br/>OF THE LADDER, SEE,

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.019
WHICH IS PROBABLY BEST.

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:19.229
I'VE GONE FROM<br/>THE TOP OF THE BOTTOM

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:22.039
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TOP, SEE?

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.239
20 YEARS AGO,

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:26.209
ROBERT WILLIAMS COULDN'T<br/>BEG ANYONE TO SHOW HIS ARTWORK,

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:29.199
AND NOW, I'VE GOT TO BEG HIM<br/>TO SHOW,

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.099
AND SO DO

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:32.119
A LOT OF OTHER GALLERIES<br/>AROUND THE WORLD

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:34.019
THAT WANT TO SHOW HIM.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:37.009
NOW IT'S NOT EVEN REALLY<br/>CONSIDERED LOWBROW AS MUCH.

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:38.129
OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS,

00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:39.999
IT'S GONE THROUGH<br/>A LOT OF CHANGES,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.089
BUT REALLY<br/>OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS,

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:44.019
IT'S GONE THROUGH<br/>AN AMAZING RENAISSANCE,

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:46.099
TO THE POINT WHERE NOW

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:50.229
THERE'S MAYBE A THOUSAND ARTISTS<br/>THAT ARE DOING THIS KIND OF ART,

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:55.279
AND THERE'S TONS OF GALLERIES<br/>ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.219
I'VE HEARD STORIES<br/>OF PEOPLE COMING BACK

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:59.209
SAYING THEY SAW MY STUFF<br/>HANGING AT SOMEBODY'S RICH PLACE

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:01.059
IN NEW YORK.

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:02.249
WE WERE JUST LEAVING A PARTY<br/>SOMEWHERE

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:05.079
AND I LOOKED IN SOMEONE'S WINDOW<br/>IN THE STREET ACROSS TOWN THERE,

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.079
AND THERE WERE PAINTINGS<br/>I'D DONE BACK IN THE '70s

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.279
HANGING ON THEIR WALL.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.109
I HEARD ONCE SOMEBODY SAID<br/>THEY WERE ALL THE WAY IN AFRICA,

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:13.059
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY GO<br/>"OH, MY GOD.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.219
IT'S ONE<br/>OF CUMMINGS'S T-SHIRTS."

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:18.119
JAPAN, THEY LOVE IT.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.229
EUROPE LOVES IT,<br/>AND THEY GET IT.

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:21.019
THEY LIKE LOOKING<br/>AT OUR OLD ADS.

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.129
THEY LIKE LISTENING<br/>TO OUR OLD BANDS.

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:23.269
THEY LIKE OUR OLD CARS.

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:26.109
JAZZ HAD TO BE EXPORTED<br/>AND THEN COME BACK

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:29.109
BEFORE IT GOT REALLY BIG<br/>AND RESPECTED.

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:30.239
ROCK AND ROLL<br/>WAS THE SAME THING.

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.239
IT HAD TO GO OVER TO ENGLAND<br/>AND THEN COME BACK.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.019
[GIARLA]:<br/>FOR THE EVOLUTION OF LOWBROW

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:37.079
TO GET TO THE POINT<br/>WHERE IT IS TODAY,

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.059
AND NOW IT'S CALLED<br/>POP SURREALISM

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.219
AND SOME OTHER TERMS,

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.099
AND WE'RE JUST NOW STARTING

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.119
TO SEE GALLERIES<br/>IN NEW YORK CITY

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.999
TAKE IT SERIOUSLY,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:55.019
AND I THINK<br/>IT'S JUST GOING TO BLOW UP.

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.279
[WILLIAMS]: A LARGE,<br/>LARGE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.199
FOOL THEMSELVES<br/>INTO THINKING THEY'RE ARTISTS

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.239
AND THEY'D JUST RATHER<br/>LIVE THE ARTISTIC LIFE,

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.109
BUT IF YOU HAVE A COMPULSION<br/>TO DO IT

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:07.099
AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT,

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:09.159
THE ART WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:14.099
[AUSGANG]: ONE OF MY FUNCTIONS<br/>IS TO INSPIRE YOUNGER ARTISTS

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.099
AND SAY "LOOK, YOU KNOW,<br/>HEY, MAN, I'M 46,

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:19.009
I'M GOING TO BE PUSHING 50,<br/>BUT I'M STILL IN IT,"

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:20.999
AND ONE OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS<br/>WHEN I MEET PEOPLE

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.159
IS TO SAY<br/>"ARE YOU IN THIS FOR LIFE?

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:25.289
BECAUSE THIS IS...<br/>THIS IS REAL, YOU KNOW?"

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:34.109
IT'S ESSENTIALLY<br/>CULTURAL WARFARE, IN A WAY.

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:36.279
FIVE YEARS AGO, 10 YEARS AGO,<br/>20 YEARS AGO,

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.009
IF YOU TOLD ME<br/>WHERE I WAS GOING TO BE,

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:39.289
YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT,

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:42.089
I WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED IT,<br/>YOU KNOW?

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.279
YOU'LL BE SITTING<br/>IN A BIG HOUSE.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:48.109
YOU'LL BE HAVING FILM CREWS<br/>OVER TO YOUR HOUSE ALL THE TIME.

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:51.089
MAGAZINES WILL SEEK, YOU KNOW,<br/>YOUR EACH AND EVERY WORD,

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:55.039
YOU'LL BE A CULTURAL ICON<br/>FROM SHORE TO SHORE, YOU KNOW,

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.009
AND YOU'LL NOT HAVE<br/>TO GO TO A JOB AGAIN.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:00.029
I WOULD HAVE NEVER THOUGHT<br/>THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:02.019
I LOVE DOING THE MUSIC<br/>WHEN I GET TO DO THAT.

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.139
THERE'S SOMETHING<br/>ABOUT BEING ON STAGE.

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.019
THERE AIN'T NOTHING ELSE<br/>LIKE IT.

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:07.209
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T EVEN<br/>GET PAID WHEN YOU PLAY,

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:11.039
BUT STILL, THE AUDIENCE<br/>PAYS YOU TENFOLD,

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.189
THE THRILL YOU GET.

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:15.999
WHEN I GET TO PAINT SOMETHING,<br/>THE THRILL I GET...

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.219
SPENT A LIFETIME<br/>STUDYING WHAT I LOVE TO DO,

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:22.199
AND I GOT A LIFETIME LEFT<br/>TO FINISH OFF WHAT I LOVE TO DO,

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:27.189
AND IF THAT AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH,<br/>I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:29.079
I LOVE COMING TO WORK EVERY DAY,

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.119
'CAUSE I GET TO WORK<br/>IN MY OWN ART GALLERY.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.229
YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE<br/>MY FIRST JUXTAPOZ,

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:36.289
I'VE LOVED THIS ARTWORK<br/>AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT,

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:39.139
AND I'M PRETTY LUCKY<br/>TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS,

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:42.039
SO I'M ENJOYING<br/>EVERY MINUTE OF THIS.

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.229
[SAMARAS]: I THINK VAN GOGH<br/>DID THIS HUGE DISSERVICE

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:46.109
TO ARTISTS EVERYWHERE

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:48.149
BY PORTRAYING THIS IDEA<br/>THAT YOU HAVE TO BE INSANE,

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:50.069
IMPOVERISHED,

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:54.059
AND, YOU KNOW, UTTERLY DEJECTED<br/>TO HAVE A CREATIVE IMPULSE,

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.269
AND I THINK THAT YOU CAN HAVE<br/>A WELLSPRING OF CREATIVITY

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:59.269
COME FROM A VERY POSITIVE PLACE<br/>IN YOUR LIFE.

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:01.189
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:03.079
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER<br/>WHAT IT'S CALLED.

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:06.039
I MEAN, PEOPLE HAVE COINED<br/>THE PHRASE "POP SURREALISM"

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.149
AND "LOWBROW..."

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:09.119
THE ONLY WAY I COULD REALLY<br/>COMPARE IT

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.289
IS THINKING ABOUT WHAT WARHOL<br/>WAS DOING IN THE '60s

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:14.259
AND THE SCENE<br/>THAT WAS AROUND IT,

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:16.019
WITH ALL THOSE DIFFERENT PEOPLE

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:20.149
AND ALL THESE<br/>DIFFERENT CHARACTERS.

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:22.009
IN 20 YEARS,<br/>IT'S GOING TO BE HUGE,

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:23.179
AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THINK<br/>IT WAS THIS GREAT THING,

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:25.069
AND THEY'RE GOING TO SAY

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:27.159
"MY GOD, I WISH I WOULD HAVE<br/>BEEN INVOLVED WITH IT MORE."

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.029
[CULLISON]: THE FACT THAT<br/>THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:33.219
ABLE TO MAKE A LIVING<br/>AND KEEP GOING WITH IT

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.219
AND ABLE TO DO<br/>SO MUCH WITH THEIR LIVES

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:37.159
AND LIVE FREELY AND TRAVEL

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.259
AND DO ALL THE THINGS<br/>THAT THEY CAN DO

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.179
OFF OF THAT ART...

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:45.079
IT IS ACCEPTED, I THINK.

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:48.080
