00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:39.030


2
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.170
In sooth, I know not why Iam so sad.

3
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.600
It wearies me.

4
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.100
You say it wearies you,

5
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.330
but how I caught it, foundit, or came by it,

6
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.770
what stuff 'tis made of,whereof it is born

7
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.100
I am to learn.

8
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.800
And such a want-witsadness makes of me

9
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.530
that I have much ado toknow myself.

10
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.770
Your mind is tossing onthe ocean.

11
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.230
There, where your argosieswith portly sail,

12
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.630
like signiors and richburghers on the flood

13
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.630
or, as it were, thepageants of the sea,

14
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.200
do overpeer the pettytraffickers

15
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.400
that curtsy to them, dothem reverence,

16
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.730
as they fly by them withtheir woven wings.

17
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.630
Believe me, sir, had Isuch venture forth,

18
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.230
the better part of myaffections would be withmy hopes abroad.

19
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.200
I should be still pluckingthe grass

20
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.400
to know where sits thewind,

21
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.700
peering in maps for portsand piers and roads,

22
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.400
and every object that mightmake me fear misfortune

23
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.170
to my venture out of doubtwould make me sad.

24
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.630
My wind cooling my brothwould blow me to an ague

25
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.430
when I thought what harm a windtoo great might do at sea.

26
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.300
I should not see the sandyhour-glass run,

27
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.570
but I should think ofshallows and of flats

28
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.530
and see my wealthy Andrewdocked in sand,

29
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.370
vailing her high-toplower than her ribs tokiss her burial.

30
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.300
Or should I go to churchand see the holy edificeof stone

31
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.300
and not bethink me straighton dangerous rocks,

32
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.370
which touching but mygentle vessel's side,

33
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.030
would scatter all herspices on the stream,

34
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.300
enrobe the roaring waterswith my silks,

35
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.830
and, in a word, but evennow worth this

36
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.530
and now worth nothing?

37
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.200
Shall I have the thoughtto think on this,

38
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.030
and shall I lack thethought

39
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.670
that such a thing bechancedwould make me sad?

40
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.230
But tell not me.

41
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.030
I know Antonio is sad tothink upon his merchandise.

42
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.300
Believe me, no.

43
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.730
I thank my fortune for it.

44
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.900
My ventures are not in onebottom trusted,

45
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.700
nor to one place, nor ismy whole estate

46
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.830
upon the fortune of thispresent year.

47
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.270
Therefore, my merchandisemakes me not sad.

48
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.700
Why, then you are in love.

49
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.430
Fie, fie.

50
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.130
Not in love neither?

51
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.700
Mm-hmm.

52
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.770
Then let us say that youare sad because you arenot merry.

53
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.700
And 'twere as easy for youto laugh and leap

54
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.070
and say you are merry

55
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.830
because you are not sad.

56
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.730
Now, by two-headed Janus,

57
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.400
nature hath framed strangefellows in her time,

58
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.430
some that will evermorepeep through their eyes

59
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.000
and laugh like parrots ata bag-piper,

60
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.270
And other of such vinegaraspect

61
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.670
that they'll not show theirteeth in way of smile,

62
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.870
though Nestor swear thejest be laughable.

63
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.030
Here comes Bassanio, yourmost noble kinsman,

64
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.470
Gratiano and Lorenzo.

65
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.670
Fare ye well.

66
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.730
We leave you now withbetter company.

67
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.530
I would have stay'd till Ihad made you merry

68
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.100
if worthier friends hadnot prevented me.

69
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.500
Your worth is very dear inmy regard.

70
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.170
I take it your ownbusiness calls on you

71
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.530
and you embrace theoccasion to depart.

72
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.730
Good morrow, my goodlords.

73
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.270
Good signiors both, whenshall we laugh?

74
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.470
Say, when?

75
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.470
You grow exceedingstrange.

76
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.770
Must it be so?

77
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.900
We'll make our leisures toattend on yours.

78
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.430
My Lord Bassanio, sinceyou have found Antonio,

79
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.800
we two will leave you.

80
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.100
But at dinner-time, I prayyou, have in mind where wemust meet.

81
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.300
I will not fail you.

82
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.870
You look not well, SigniorAntonio.

83
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.630
You have too much respectupon the world.

84
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.200
They lose it that do buyit with much care.

85
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.770
Believe me, you aremarvelously changed.

86
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.170
I hold the world, but asthe world, Gratiano,

87
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.670
a stage where every manmust play a part, and minea sad one.

88
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.000
Let me play the fool.

89
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.530
With mirth and laughter,let old wrinkles come

90
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.570
or let my liver ratherheat with wine

91
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.800
than my heart cool withmortifying groans.

92
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.430
Why should a man whoseblood is warm within

93
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.470
sit like his grandsire cutin alabaster,

94
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.200
sleep when he wakes,

95
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.930
and creep into thejaundice by being peevish?

96
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.630
I tell thee what, Antonio,

97
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.500
I love thee, and 'tis mylove that speaks.

98
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.570
There are a sort of menwhose visages

99
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.730
do cream and mantle like astanding pond

100
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.700
and do a wilful stillnessentertain

101
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.600
with purpose to be dressedin an opinion

102
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.530
of wisdom, gravity,profound conceit,

103
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.730
as who should say "I amSir Oracle,

104
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.770
and when I ope my lips,let no dog bark."

105
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.130
Oh, my Antonio, I do knowof these

106
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.470
who therefore only are reputedwise for saying nothing,

107
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.330
when, I am very sure, ifthey should speak,

108
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.800
would almost damn thoseears which, hearing them,

109
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.170
would call their brothersfools.

110
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.930
I'll tell thee more ofthis another time.

111
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.530
But fish not with thismelancholy bait,

112
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.130
for this fool gudgeon,this opinion.

113
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.430
Come, good Lorenzo.

114
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.530
Fare ye well awhile.

115
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.470
I'll end my exhortationafter dinner.

116
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.700
Well, we will leave youthen till dinner-time.

117
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.930
I must be one of thesesame dumb wise men,

118
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.230
for Gratiano never lets mespeak.

119
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.830
Well, keep me company buttwo years moe,

120
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.800
thou shalt not know thesound of thine own tongue.

121
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.030
Fare you well.

122
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.900
I'll grow a talker forthis gear.

123
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.600
Thanks, i' faith, forsilence is only commendable

124
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:07.070
in a neat's tongue driedand a maid not vendible.

125
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.800
Is that any thing now?

126
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.270
Gratiano speaks aninfinite deal of nothing,

127
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.070
more than any man in allVenice.

128
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.700
His reasons are as twograins of wheat

129
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.430
hid in two bushels ofchaff.

130
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.830
You shall seek all day ereyou find them,

131
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.830
and when you have them, theyare not worth the search.

132
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.400
Well, tell me now whatlady is the same

133
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.030
to whom you swore a secretpilgrimage

134
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.700
that you to-day promisedto tell me of?

135
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.530
'Tis not unknown to you,Antonio,

136
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.730
how much I have disabledmine estate

137
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.300
by something showing amore swelling port

138
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.830
than my faint means wouldgrant continuance.

139
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.430
Nor do I now make moan tobe abridged from such anoble rate,

140
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.430
but my chief care is tocome fairly off

141
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.800
from the great debtswherein my time

142
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.370
something too prodigalhath left me gaged.

143
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:07.330
To you, Antonio, I owe themost in money and in love.

144
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.630
And from your love,

145
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.870
I have a warranty to unburdenall my plots and purposes

146
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.730
how to get clear of allthe debts I owe.

147
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.630
I pray you, good Bassanio,let me know it.

148
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.600
And if it stand, as youyourself still do,

149
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.330
within the eye of honour,

150
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.770
be assured my purse, myperson, my extremest means

151
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.470
lie all unlocked to youroccasions.

152
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.730
In my school-days, when Ihad lost one shaft,

153
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.130
I shot his fellow of theself-same flight

154
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.400
the self-same way withmore advised watch

155
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.830
to find the other forth.

156
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.500
And by adventuring both, Ioft found both.

157
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.100
I urge this childhoodproof,

158
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.470
because what follows ispure innocence.

159
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.070
I owe you much,

160
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.430
and, like a wilful youth,

161
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.470
that which I owe is lost,

162
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.200
but if you please to shootanother arrow

163
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.030
that self way which youdid shoot the first,

164
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.570
I do not doubt, as I willwatch the aim,

165
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.800
or to find both or bring yourlatter hazard back again

166
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.770
and thankfully rest debtorfor the first.

167
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.700
You know me well, andherein spend but time

168
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.100
to wind about my love withcircumstance.

169
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.570
And out of doubt, you dome now more wrong

170
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.070
in making question of myuttermost

171
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.470
than if you had made wasteof all I have.

172
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.100
Then do but say to me whatI should do

173
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.000
that in your knowledge mayby me be done,

174
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.130
and I am prest unto it.

175
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.230
Therefore, speak.

176
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:47.170
In Belmont is a ladyrichly left.

177
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:51.930
And she is fair, and,fairer than that word,

178
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.470
of wondrous virtues.

179
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.230
Sometimes from her eyes,

180
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.330
I did receive fairspeechless messages.

181
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.300
Her name is Portia,

182
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.600
nothing undervalued to Cato'sdaughter, Brutus' Portia.

183
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.400
Nor is the wide worldignorant of her worth,

184
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.800
for the four winds blowin from every coastrenowned suitors,

185
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.100
and her sunny locks hangon her temples like agolden fleece,

186
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.970
which makes her seat ofBelmont Colchos' strand,

187
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.330
and many Jasons come inquest of her.

188
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.630
Oh, my Antonio, had I butthe means

189
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.030
to hold a rival place withone of them,

190
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.030
I have a mind presages mesuch thrift

191
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.470
that I should questionlessbe fortunate.

192
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:42.230
Thou know'st that all myfortunes are at sea.

193
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.970
Neither have I money norcommodity to raise apresent sum.

194
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.500
Therefore, go forth.

195
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.600
Try what my credit can inVenice do

196
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.830
that shall be racked, evento the uttermost,

197
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.900
to furnish thee to Belmontto fair Portia.

198
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.700
Go, presently inquire, andso will I, where money is.

199
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:08.100
And I no question make tohave it of my trust or formy sake.

200
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.370
By my troth, Nerissa,

201
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.030
my little body is awearyof this great world.

202
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.230
You would be, sweet madam,if your miseries

203
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.370
were in the same abundanceas your good fortunes are.

204
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:44.470
And yet, for aught I see,they are as sick thatsurfeit with too much

205
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.600
as they that starve withnothing.

206
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.230
It is no mean happiness,therefore,

207
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.770
to be seated in the mean.

208
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.270
Superfluity comes soonerby white hairs,

209
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.270
but competency liveslonger.

210
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.170
Good sentences and wellpronounced.

211
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.430
They would be better ifwell followed.

212
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.900
If to do were as easy as toknow what were good to do,

213
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.900
chapels had been churches,

214
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.300
and poor men's cottages,princes' palaces.

215
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.970
It is a good divine thatfollows his own instructions.

216
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.770
I can easier teach twentywhat were good to be done

217
00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.370
than be one of the twenty tofollow mine own teaching.

218
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.070
The brain may devise lawsfor the blood,

219
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.700
but a hot temper leapso'er a cold decree.

220
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.570
Such a hare is madness theyouth

221
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:30.670
to skip o'er the meshes ofgood counsel the cripple.

222
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:35.870
But this reasoning is notin the fashion to chooseme a husband.

223
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:40.970
Oh, me, the word "choose."

224
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:48.570
I may neither choosewhom I would nor refusewhom I dislike.

225
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:57.300
So is the will of a livingdaughter curbed by thewill of a dead father.

226
00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.970
Is it not hard, Nerissa,

227
00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.970
that I cannot choose onenor refuse none?

228
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:06.370
Your father was evervirtuous.

229
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:11.130
And holy men, at their death,have good inspirations.

230
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.100
Therefore, the lotterythat he hath devised

231
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.330
in these three chests ofgold, silver and lead,

232
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:22.670
whereof who chooses hismeaning chooses you, will,no doubt,

233
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:29.100
never be chosen by anyrightly but one whom youshall rightly love.

234
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.000
What warmth is there inyour affections

235
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.300
towards any of theseprincely suitors that arealready come?

236
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.830
I pray thee, over-namethem.

237
00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:42.470
And as thou namest them, Iwill describe them.

238
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.370
And, according to mydescription, level at myaffection.

239
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:49.300
First, there is theNeapolitan prince.

240
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.870
Ay, that's a colt indeed,

241
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.130
for he doth nothing buttalk of his horse.

242
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.570
And he makes it a greatappropriation

243
00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.400
to his own good parts thathe can shoe him himself.

244
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.870
I am much afeard, my lady,

245
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.500
his mother played falsewith a smith.

246
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.130
Then there is the CountyPalatine.

247
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.400
He doth nothing but frown,as who should say,

248
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.830
"If you will not have me,choose."

249
00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.270
He hears merry tales andsmiles not.

250
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.200
I fear he will prove theweeping philosopher whenhe grows old,

251
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.700
being so full of unmannerlysadness in his youth.

252
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.400
I had rather be married toa death's-head

253
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.570
with a bone in his mouththan to either of these.

254
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.970
God defend me from thesetwo.

255
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.200
How say you by the Frenchlord, Monsieur Le Bon?

256
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.530
God made him, and thereforelet him pass for a man.

257
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.770
In truth, I know it is asin to be a mocker,

258
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.400
but, he, why, he hath ahorse better than theNeapolitan's,

259
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.770
a better bad habit offrowning than the CountPalatine.

260
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.870
He is every man in no man.

261
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.400
If a throstle sing, hefalls straight a capering.

262
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.900
He will fence with his ownshadow.

263
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.900
If I should marry him, Ishould marry twentyhusbands.

264
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.170
If he would despise me, Iwould forgive him,

265
00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:00.470
for if he love me tomadness, I shall neverrequite him.

266
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.270
What say you, then, toFalconbridge,

267
00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.970
the young baron ofEngland?

268
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.370
You know I say nothing tohim,

269
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.130
for he understands not me,nor I him.

270
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.500
He hath neither Latin,French, nor Italian,

271
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.330
and you will come into thecourt

272
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.970
and swear that I have a poorpennyworth in the English.

273
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.030
Oh, he is a proper man'spicture,

274
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.430
but, alas, who couldconverse with a dumb-show?

275
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.270
How oddly he is suited.

276
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.770
I think he bought hisdoublet in Italy, hisround hose in France,

277
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.770
his bonnet in Germany, andhis behavior everywhere.

278
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:32.770
What think you of theScottish lord, his neighbor?

279
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.570
That he hath a neighborlycharity in him,

280
00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.500
for he borrowed a box ofthe ear of the Englishman

281
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.600
and swore he would pay himagain when he was able.

282
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.770
I think the Frenchmanbecame his surety andsealed under for another.

283
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.970
How like you the youngGerman, the Duke ofSaxony's nephew?

284
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.300
Very vilely in themorning, when he is sober,

285
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.930
and most vilely in theafternoon, when he isdrunk.

286
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.800
When he is best, he is alittle worse than a man,

287
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.670
and when he is worst, he islittle better than a beast.

288
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.330
And the worst fall thatever fell,

289
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.070
I hope I shall make shiftto go without him.

290
00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:06.200
If he should offer tochoose, and choose theright casket,

291
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.230
you should refuse toperform your father's will

292
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.200
if you should refuse toaccept him.

293
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.800
Therefore, for fear of theworst,

294
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.070
I pray thee, set a deepglass of Rhenish wine

295
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.370
on the contrary casket,for if the devil be within

296
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.800
and that temptationwithout, I know he willchoose it.

297
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.700
I will do any thing,Nerissa,

298
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.930
ere I will be married to asponge.

299
00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:29.170
You need not fear, lady, thehaving any of these lords.

300
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.800
They have acquainted mewith their determinations,

301
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.670
which is, indeed, toreturn to their home

302
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.300
and to trouble you with nomore suit

303
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.630
unless you may be won bysome other sort

304
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:41.730
than your father'simposition depending onthe caskets.

305
00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:47.830
If I live to be as old asSibylla, I will die aschaste as Diana

306
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:53.170
unless I be obtained by themanner of my father's will.

307
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.700
I am glad this parcel ofwooers are so reasonable,

308
00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.230
for there is not one amongthem but I dote on hisvery absence,

309
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.900
and I pray God grant thema fair departure.

310
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:08.100
Do you not remember, lady,in your father's time,

311
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.070
a Venetian, a scholar anda soldier

312
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:15.800
that came hither incompany of the Marquis ofMontferrat?

313
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.170
Yes, yes, it was Bassanio.

314
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.730
As I think so was hecalled.

315
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.200
True, madam.

316
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.730
He, of all the men thatever my foolish eyeslooked upon,

317
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:32.100
was the best deserving afair lady.

318
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.700
I remember him well,

319
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.400
and I remember him worthyof thy praise.

320
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.970
How now, what news?

321
00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:42.130
The four strangers seekfor you, Madam, to taketheir leave.

322
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.100
And there is a forerunnercome from a fifth,

323
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.170
the Prince of Morocco,

324
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:52.300
who brings word theprince, his master, willbe here to-night.

325
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.430
If I could bid the fifthwelcome

326
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.970
with so good heart as I bidthe other four farewell,

327
00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.570
I should be glad of hisapproach.

328
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:02.930
If he have the conditionof a saint and thecomplexion of a devil,

329
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.000
I had rather he shouldshrive me than wive me.

330
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.630
Come, Nerissa.

331
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:12.100
Sirrah, go before.

332
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:17.030
Whiles we shut the gateupon one wooer, anotherknocks at the door.

333
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:31.900
3,000 ducats.

334
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.870
Well--

335
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.230
Ay, sir, for three months.

336
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.330
For three months.

337
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.430
Well--

338
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.100
For the which, as I toldyou, Antonio shall be bound.

339
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.330
Antonio shall becomebound.

340
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.730
Well.

341
00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.230
May you stead me?

342
00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.530
Will you pleasure me?

343
00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:56.400
Shall I know your answer?

344
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.130
3,000 ducats for threemonths and Antonio bound.

345
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:02.200
Your answer to that.

346
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.530
Antonio is a good man.

347
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:11.400
Have you heard anyimputation to the contrary?

348
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.830
Oh, no, no, no.

349
00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.130
My meaning in saying he isa good man

350
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:21.500
is to have you understandme that he is sufficient.

351
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.770
Yet his means are insupposition.

352
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.900
He hath an argosy bound toTripolis, another to theIndies.

353
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.170
I understand moreover,upon the Rialto,

354
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.030
he hath a third at Mexico,a fourth for England,

355
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:38.270
and other ventures he hathsquandered abroad.

356
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:42.170
But ships are but boards,sailors but men.

357
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.830
There be land-rats andwater-rats,

358
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.000
land-thieves andwater-thieves--

359
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.900
I mean pirates--

360
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:55.430
and then there is theperil of waters, winds,and rocks.

361
00:18:55.430 --> 00:19:02.530
The man is--notwithstanding--sufficient.

362
00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:05.100
3,000 ducats.

363
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.630
I think I may take hisbond.

364
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:11.730
Be assured you may.

365
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.230
I will be assured I may.

366
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.800
And, that I may be assured,I will bethink me.

367
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.100
May I speak with Antonio?

368
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.770
If it please you to dinewith us.

369
00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.700
Yes, to smell pork, to eatof the habitation

370
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.770
which your prophet, theNazarite,

371
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:27.230
conjured the devil into.

372
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.400
I will buy with you, sellwith you, talk with you,

373
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.770
walk with you, and sofollowing,

374
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.400
but I will not eat withyou, drink with you,

375
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.770
nor pray with you.

376
00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.530
What news on the Rialto?

377
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:38.630
Who is he comes here?

378
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.000
This is Signior Antonio.

379
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.870
How like a fawningpublican he looks.

380
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.770
I hate him for he is aChristian,

381
00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.930
but more, for that, in lowsimplicity,

382
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:52.770
he lends out money gratis

383
00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:56.100
and brings down the rate ofusance here with us inVenice.

384
00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.800
If I can catch him onceupon the hip,

385
00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.830
I will feed fat theancient grudge I bear him.

386
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:07.730
He hates our sacrednation, and he rails,

387
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.630
even there where merchantsmost do congregate,

388
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:13.530
on me, my bargains, and mywell-won thrift,

389
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.870
which he calls interest.

390
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:18.570
Cursed be my tribe if Iforgive him.

391
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.700
Shylock, do you hear?

392
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.130
I am debating of mypresent store.

393
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:28.070
And, by the near guess ofmy memory,

394
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.370
I cannot instantly raiseup the gross

395
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.470
of full 3,000 ducats.

396
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:33.600
What of that?

397
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.800
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew ofmy tribe, will furnish me.

398
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.070
But soft.

399
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.800
How many months do youdesire?

400
00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.270
Rest you fair, goodsignior.

401
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.300
Your worship was the lastman in our mouths.

402
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.930
Shylock, albeit I neitherlend nor borrow

403
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.970
by taking nor by giving ofexcess,

404
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:51.870
yet, to supply the ripewants of my friend,

405
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.100
I'll break a custom.

406
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.670
Is he yet possessed howmuch ye would?

407
00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.000
Ay, ay, 3,000 ducats.

408
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.270
And for three months.

409
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.100
I had forgot-- threemonths.

410
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.400
You told me so.

411
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.730
Well then, your bond.

412
00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:06.430
And let me see.

413
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.730
But hear you.

414
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:13.570
Methought you said youneither lend nor borrowupon advantage.

415
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:14.830
I do never use it.

416
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:20.870
When Jacob grazed hisuncle Laban's sheep--

417
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.870
this Jacob from our holyAbram was,

418
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.630
as his wise mother wroughtin his behalf, the thirdpossessor.

419
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:27.830
Ay, he was the third--

420
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.030
And what of him?

421
00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:30.230
Did he take interest?

422
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:32.670
No, not take interest,

423
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.300
not, as you would say,directly interest.

424
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.300
Mark what Jacob did.

425
00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.470
When Laban and himselfwere compromised

426
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:47.630
that all the eanlings whichwere streaked and pied

427
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.970
should fall as Jacob'shire.

428
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.270
The ewes, being rank,

429
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.230
in the end of autumnturned to the rams.

430
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:59.370
And, when the work ofgeneration

431
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:02.630
was between these woollybreeders in the act,

432
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.300
the skilful shepherdpeeled me certain wands.

433
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.600
And, in the doing of thedeed of kind,

434
00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.230
he stuck them up beforethe fulsome ewes,

435
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:15.070
who then conceiving did.in eaning time,

436
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:19.400
fall parti-coloured lambs,and those were Jacob's.

437
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.730
This was a way to thrive,and he was blessed.

438
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:26.100
And thrift is blessing ifmen steal it not.

439
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.530
This was a venture, sir,that Jacob served for,

440
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.170
a thing not in his powerto bring to pass,

441
00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.330
but swayed and fashionedby the hand of heaven.

442
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.730
Was this inserted to makeinterest good?

443
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.430
Or is your gold and silverewes and rams?

444
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:37.670
I cannot tell.

445
00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.670
I make it breed as fast.

446
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.600
But note me, signior.

447
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.000
Mark you this, Bassanio,

448
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.770
the devil can citeScripture for his purpose.

449
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.500
An evil soul producingholy witness

450
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.700
is like a villain with asmiling cheek,

451
00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.230
a goodly apple rotten atthe heart.

452
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.570
Oh, what a goodly outsidefalsehood hath.

453
00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:03.270
3,000 ducats, 'tis a good,round sum.

454
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:07.330
Three months from twelve.

455
00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:08.700
Now, let me see.

456
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.930
The rate--

457
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.900
Well, Shylock, shall we bebeholding to you?

458
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:20.770
Signior Antonio, many atime and oft in the Rialto,

459
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:25.470
you have rated me about mymoney and my usances.

460
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.030
Still have I borne it witha patient shrug,

461
00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.130
for sufferance is thebadge of all our tribe.

462
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:36.770
You call me misbeliever,cut-throat dog,

463
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.530
and spit upon my Jewishgaberdine,

464
00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.870
and all for use of thatwhich is mine own.

465
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:46.130
Well then, it now appearsyou need my help.

466
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:47.430
Go to, then.

467
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:48.770
You come to me, and yousay,

468
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.530
"Shylock, we would havemoneys."

469
00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:51.730
You say so.

470
00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:54.700
You, that did void yourrheum upon my beard

471
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.570
and foot me as you spurn astranger

472
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:57.930
cur over your threshold.

473
00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.570
Moneys is your suit.

474
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.170
What should I say to you?

475
00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:03.530
Should I not say "Hath adog money?

476
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:08.000
Is it possible a cur canlend 3,000 ducats?"

477
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.370
Or shall I bend low and ina bondman's key

478
00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.230
with bated breath

479
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.300
and whispering humblenesssay this,

480
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.070
"Fair sir, you spit on meon Wednesday last.

481
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.330
"You spurn'd me such aday.

482
00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:20.900
"Another time, you calledme dog.

483
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.870
And for these courtesies, I'lllend you thus much moneys"?

484
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.670
I am as like to call theeso again,

485
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.070
to spit on thee again, tospurn thee too.

486
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.030
If thou wilt lend thismoney, lend it not as tothy friends.

487
00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:33.230
For when did friendshiptake a breed

488
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.000
of barren metal for hisfriend?

489
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
But lend it rather to thineenemy who, if he break,

490
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.870
thou mayst with betterface exact the penalty.

491
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:45.200
Why, look you, how youstorm.

492
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.870
I would be friends withyou and have your love--

493
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:52.000
forget the shames that youhave stained me with--

494
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.500
supply your present wants

495
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.800
and take no doit of usancefor my moneys,

496
00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.030
and you'll not hear me.

497
00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.300
This is kind I offer.

498
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.500
This were kindness.

499
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.630
This kindness will I show.

500
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:03.070
Go with me to a notary.

501
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.770
Seal me there your singlebond.

502
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:06.930
And, in a merry sport--

503
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.070
If you repay me not on sucha day, in such a place,

504
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:18.500
such sum or sums as areexpressed in the condition,

505
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:26.730
let the forfeit benominated for an equalpound of your fair flesh

506
00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:30.830
to be cut off and taken inwhat part of your bodypleaseth me.

507
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:33.230
Content, i' faith.

508
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:34.500
I'll seal to such a bond

509
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.730
and say there is muchkindness in the Jew.

510
00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.130
You shall not seal to sucha bond for me.

511
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.130
I'd rather dwell in mynecessity.

512
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:44.330
Fear not, man.

513
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:45.470
I will not forfeit it.

514
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:46.600
Within these two months,

515
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.270
that's a month before thisbond expires,

516
00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:49.400
I do expect return

517
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.200
of thrice three times thevalue of this bond.

518
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:56.300
Oh, father Abraham, whatthese Christians are

519
00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:01.170
whose own hard dealingsteaches them suspect thethoughts of others.

520
00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:02.400
Pray you, tell me this.

521
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.470
If he should break hisday, what should I gain

522
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.400
by the exaction of theforfeiture?

523
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.800
A pound of man's fleshtaken from a man is not soestimable,

524
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.600
profitable neither, as fleshof muttons, beefs, or goats.

525
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:18.330
I say, to buy his favour,I extend this friendship.

526
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:19.900
If he will take it, so.

527
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.670
If not, adieu.

528
00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:24.370
