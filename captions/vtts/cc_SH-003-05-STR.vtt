00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830


2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.670
If I may trust the flatteringtruth of sleep,

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.170
My dreams presage somejoyful news at hand:

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.000
My bosom's lord sitslightly in his throne;

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.830
And all this day anunaccustom'd spirit

6
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.970
Lifts me above the groundwith cheerful thoughts.

7
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.070
I dreamt my lady came andfound me dead--

8
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.430
Strange dream, that gives adead man leave to think!--

9
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.400
And breathed such lifewith kisses in my lips,

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.370
That I revived, and was anemperor.

11
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:37.070
News from Verona! How now,Balthasar!

12
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.130
Dost thou not bring meletters from the friar?

13
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.600
How doth my lady?

14
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.700
Is my father well?

15
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.900
How fares my Juliet? thatI ask again;

16
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.470
For nothing can be ill, ifshe be well.

17
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.300
Then she is well, andnothing can be ill:

18
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.900
Her body sleeps in Capel'smonument,

19
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.300
And her immortal part withangels lives.

20
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.070
I saw her laid low in herkindred's vault,

21
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.830
And presently took post totell it you:

22
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.400
O, pardon me for bringingthese ill news,

23
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.130
Since you did leave it formy office, sir.

24
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.130
Is it even so?

25
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.470
then I defy you, stars!

26
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.970
Go hire post-horses; Iwill hence to-night.

27
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.970
I do beseech you, sir,have patience:

28
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.670
Your looks are pale andwild, and do import

29
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.770
Some misadventure.

30
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.900
Tush, thou art deceived:

31
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.630
Leave me, and do the thingI bid thee do.

32
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.170
Hast thou no letters to mefrom the friar?

33
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.970
No, my good lord.

34
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.070
No matter: get thee gone,

35
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.130
I'll go hence tonight.

36
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.500
Well, Juliet, I will liewith thee to-night.

37
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.300
Let's see for means:

38
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.070
O mischief, thou art swift

39
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.900
To enter in the thoughtsof desperate men!

40
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.770
What, ho! apothecary!

41
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.630
Who calls so loud?

42
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.470
Come hither, man. I seethat thou art poor:

43
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.930
Hold, there is fortyducats: let me have

44
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.630
A dram of poison, suchsoon-speeding gear

45
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.570
As will disperse itselfthrough the veins

46
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.770
That the life-weary takermay fall dead.

47
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.730
Such mortal drugs I have;but Mantua's law

48
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.030
Is death to any he thatutters them.

49
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.970
Art thou so bare and fullof wretchedness,

50
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.070
And fear'st to die? famineis in thy cheeks,

51
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.730
Need and oppressionstarveth in thy eyes,

52
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.670
Contempt and beggary hangsupon thy back;

53
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.470
The world is not thy friendnor the world's law;

54
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.970
The world affords no lawto make thee rich;

55
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.070
Then be not poor, butbreak it, and take this.

56
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.500
My poverty, but not mywill, consents.

57
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.330
I pay thy poverty, and notthy will.

58
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.000
Put this in any liquidthing you will,

59
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.570
And drink it off; and, ifyou had the strength

60
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.570
Of twenty men, it woulddispatch you straight.

61
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.130
There is thy gold, worsepoison to men's souls,

62
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.470
Doing more murder in thisloathsome world,

63
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.330
Than these poor compoundsthat thou mayst not sell.

64
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.830
I sell thee poison; thouhast sold me none.

65
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.600
Holy Franciscan friar!brother, ho!

66
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.230
Welcome from Mantua: whatsays Romeo?

67
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.000
Or, if his mind be writ,give me his letter.

68
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.800
Going to find a bare-footbrother out

69
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.000
One of our order, toassociate me,

70
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.530
Here in this city visitingthe sick,

71
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.070
And finding him, thesearchers of the town,

72
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.370
Suspecting that we bothwere in a house

73
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.230
Where the infectiouspestilence did reign,

74
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.870
Seal'd up the doors, andwould not let us forth;

75
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.730
So that my speed to Mantuathere was stay'd.

76
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.500
Who bare my letter, then,to Romeo?

77
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.930
I could not send it-- hereit is again--

78
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.130
Nor get a messenger tobring it thee,

79
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.030
So fearful were they ofthe infection.

80
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.770
Unhappy fortune! by mybrotherhood,

81
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.730
The letter was not nicebut full of charge

82
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.600
Of dear import, and theneglecting it

83
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.670
May do much danger.

84
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.430
Friar John, go hence;

85
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.700
Get me an iron crow, andbring it straight

86
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.900
Unto my cell.

87
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.930
Brother-- I'll go andbring it thee.

88
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.530
Now must I to the monumentalone;

89
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.330
Within this three hourswill fair Juliet wake:

90
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.400
She will beshrew me muchthat Romeo

91
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.830
Hath had no notice ofthese accidents;

92
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.370
But I will write again toMantua,

93
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.370
And keep her at my celltill Romeo come;

94
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.130
Poor living corse, closedin a dead man's tomb!

95
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.500
Give me thy torch, boy:hence, and stand aloof.

96
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.100
Sweet flower, with flowersthy bridal bed I strew--

97
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.530
O woe! thy canopy is dustand stones--

98
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.870
Which with sweet waternightly I will dew,

99
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.030
Or, wanting that, withtears distill'd by moans:

100
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.000
The obsequies that I forthee will keep

101
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Nightly shall be to strewthy grave and weep.

102
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.200
The boy gives warning;something doth approach.

103
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.330
What cursed foot wandersthis way to-night,

104
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.370
To cross my obsequies andtrue love's rite?

105
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.870
What with a torch! muffleme, night, awhile.

106
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:53.530
Give me the light:

107
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.570
upon thy life, I chargethee,

108
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.200
Whate'er thou hear'st orseest, stand all aloof,

109
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.700
And do not interrupt me inmy course.

110
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.370
But if thou, jealous, dostreturn to pry

111
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.670
In what I further shallintend to do,

112
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.570
By heaven, I will tearthee joint by joint

113
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.300
And strew this hungrychurchyard with thy limbs:

114
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.370
The time and my intentsare savage-wild,

115
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.630
More fierce and moreinexorable far

116
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.900
Than empty tigers or theroaring sea.

117
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.730
I will be gone, sir, andnot trouble you.

118
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.730
Take thou that:

119
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.400
Live, and be prosperous:and farewell, good fellow.

120
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.430
For all this same, I'llhide me hereabout:

121
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.370
His looks I fear, and hisintents I doubt.

122
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:06.730
Thou detestable maw, thouwomb of death,

123
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.900
Gorged with the dearestmorsel of the earth,

124
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.500
Thus I enforce thy rottenjaws to open,

125
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.530
And, in despite, I'll cramthee with more food!

126
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.730
This is that banish'dhaughty Montague,

127
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.500
That murder'd my love'scousin, with which grief,

128
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.470
It is supposed, the faircreature died;

129
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.030
And now is come to do somevillanous shame

130
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.670
To the dead bodies: I willapprehend him.

131
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.730
Stop thy unhallow'd toil,vile Montague!

132
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.730
Can vengeance be pursuedfurther than death?

133
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.570
Condemned villain, I doapprehend thee:

134
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.630
Obey, and go with me; forthou must die.

135
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.200
I must indeed; andtherefore came I hither.

136
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:57.370
Good gentle youth, temptnot a desperate man;

137
00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.030
Put not another sin uponmy head,

138
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:03.570
By urging me to fury: O,be gone!

139
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.330
By heaven, I love theebetter than myself;

140
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.470
For I come hither arm'dagainst myself:

141
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:14.030
Stay not, be gone; live,and hereafter say,

142
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.800
A madman's mercy bade theerun away.

143
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.970
I do defy thy conjuration,

144
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.970
And apprehend thee for afelon here.

145
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.670
Wilt thou provoke me?

146
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.800
then have at thee, boy!

147
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.170
O, I am slain!

148
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.770
If thou be merciful,

149
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.400
Open the tomb, lay me withJuliet.

150
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.200
Let me peruse this face.

151
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.830
Mercutio's kinsman, nobleCounty Paris!

152
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.430
What said my man, when mybetossed soul

153
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.930
Did not attend him as werode?

154
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.900
I think he said Parisshould have married Juliet:

155
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.330
Said he not so? or did Idream it so?

156
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.830
Or am I mad, hearing himtalk of Juliet,

157
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.070
To think it was so?

158
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:23.570
Give me thy hand,

159
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.470
One writ with me in sourmisfortune's book!

160
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.700
I'll bury thee in atriumphant grave.

161
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.430
I will go call the watch.

162
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.770
A grave?

163
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.330
Oh, no, a lantern,slaughter'd youth,

164
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.670
for here lies Juliet, andher beauty makes

165
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.830
This vault a feastingpresence full of light.

166
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.030
O my love!

167
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.170
my wife!

168
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.600
Death, that hath suck'dthe honey of thy breath,

169
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.330
Hath had no power yet uponthy beauty:

170
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:25.370
Thou art not conquer'd;beauty's ensign yet

171
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.630
Is crimson in thy lips andin thy cheeks,

172
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.470
And death's pale flag isnot advanced there.

173
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:49.000
Tybalt, liest thou therein thy bloody sheet?

174
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.830
O, what more favour can Ido to thee,

175
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.230
Than with that hand thatcut thy youth in twain

176
00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.730
To sunder his that wasthine enemy?

177
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.100
Forgive me, cousin!

178
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:14.430
Ah, dear Juliet,

179
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:20.000
Why art thou yet so fair?

180
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.300
shall I believe

181
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.600
That unsubstantial deathis amorous,

182
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.000
And that the lean abhorredmonster keeps

183
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.600
Thee here in dark to behis paramour?

184
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.570
For fear of that, I stillwill stay with thee;

185
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:38.770
And never from this palaceof dim night depart.

186
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:43.700
Here, here will I stay

187
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:48.770
With worms that are thychamber-maids.

188
00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.430
Here will I set up myeverlasting rest,

189
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:53.970
And shake the yoke ofinauspicious stars

190
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.470
From this world-weariedflesh.

191
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.430
Eyes, look your last!

192
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:09.400
Arms, take your lastembrace!

193
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.000
and, lips, O you

194
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.830
The doors of breath, sealwith a righteous kiss

195
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.730
A dateless bargain toengrossing death!

196
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:34.670
Come, bitter conduct,come, unsavoury guide!

197
00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.130
Here's to my love!

198
00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:02.300
Thus with a kiss...

199
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.470
I die.

200
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.970
Saint Francis be my speed!how oft to-night

201
00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.270
Have my old feet stumbledat graves!

202
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.630
Who's there?

203
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.230
Here's one, a friend, andone that knows you well.

204
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.430
Bliss be upon you!

205
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.730
Tell me, good my friend,

206
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.900
What torch is yond, thatvainly lends its light

207
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.030
To grubs and eyelessskulls? as I discern,

208
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.770
It burneth in the Capel'smonument.

209
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.670
It doth so, holy sir; andthere's my master,

210
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:29.970
One that you love.

211
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.100
Who is it?

212
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.500
Romeo.

213
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.600
How long hath he beenthere?

214
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.370
Full half an hour.

215
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:37.730
Go with me to the vault.

216
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.230
I dare not, sir.

217
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.730
My master knows not but Iam gone hence;

218
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.230
And fearfully did menaceme with death,

219
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.770
If I did stay to look onhis intents.

220
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:45.600
Stay, then; I'll go alone.

221
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.930
Fear comes upon me:

222
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:53.570
O, much I fear some illunthrifted thing.

223
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.430
Alack, alack, what bloodis this, that stains

224
00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:00.570
The stony entrance of thissepulchre?

225
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.330
What mean these masterlessand gory swords

226
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:07.500
To lie discolour'd by thisplace of peace?

227
00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.830
Romeo!

228
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:21.030
O, pale!

229
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:26.000
Who else? what, Paris too?

230
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.800
And steep'd in blood?

231
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.400
Oh, what an unkind hour

232
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.300
Is guilty of thislamentable chance!

233
00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.130
The lady stirs.

234
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:44.700
O comfortable friar! whereis my lord?

235
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.000
I do remember well where Ishould be,

236
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And there I am.

237
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.970
Where is my Romeo?

238
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.270
I hear some noise.

239
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.400
Lady, come from that nest

240
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.170
Of death, contagion, andunnatural sleep:

241
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:59.830
A greater power than wecan contradict

242
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.300
Hath thwarted our intents.

243
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.930
Come, come away.

244
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:07.670
Thy husband in thy bosomthere lies dead;

245
00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.570
And Paris too.

246
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.200
Come, I'll dispose of thee

247
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.800
Among a sisterhood of holynuns:

248
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.430
Stay not to question, forthe watch is coming;

249
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:23.430
Come, go, good Juliet.

250
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.600
I dare no longer stay.

251
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.670
Go, get thee hence, for Iwill not away.

252
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:40.230
What's here? a cup, closedin my true love's hand?

253
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.970
Poison, I see, hath beenhis timeless end:

254
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:54.230
O churl! drunk all, andleft no friendly drop

255
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:56.970
To help me after?

256
00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:00.070
I will kiss thy lips;

257
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.470
Haply some poison yet dothhang on them,

258
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.600
To make die with arestorative.

259
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.400
Thy lips are warm.

260
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.570
This is the place; there,where the torch doth burn.

261
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:20.470
Yea, noise.

262
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.670
Then I'll be brief.

263
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:29.000
O, happy dagger,

264
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.300
this is thy sheath.

265
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.230
There rust, and let medie.

266
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.130
The ground is bloody;

267
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.030
search about thechurchyard:

268
00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:59.130
Go, some of you, whoe'eryou find attach.

269
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:03.430
Here's Romeo's man; we foundhim in the churchyard.

270
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:08.470
Hold him in safety, tillthe prince come hither.

271
00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.330
What misadventure is soearly up,

272
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.970
That calls our person fromour morning rest?

273
00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.200
What should it be, that isso shrieked abroad?

274
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.970
The people in the streetscry Romeo,

275
00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.730
Some Juliet, and someParis; and all run,

276
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.000
With open outcry towardour monument.

277
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.930
What fear is this thatstartles in our ears?

278
00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:49.300
Sovereign, here lies theCounty Paris slain;

279
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.570
Romeo dead; and Juliet,dead before,

280
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.300
Warm and new kill'd.

281
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.270
Seal up the mouth ofoutrage for a while,

282
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.900
Till we can clear theseambiguities.

283
00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:11.000
Search, seek, and know howthis foul murder comes.

284
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.870
Where are the parties ofsuspicion?

285
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:17.270
I am the greatest, able todo least.

286
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:20.070
And here I stand, both toimpeach and purge

287
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.330
Myself condemned andmyself excused.

288
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.570
Then say at once what thoudost know in this.

289
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:31.370
Romeo, there dead, washusband to that Juliet.

290
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.470
O heavens, O wife,

291
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.570
Look how our daughterbleeds.

292
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.630
This dagger is mista'en--for, lo, his house

293
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.130
Is empty on the back ofMontague--

294
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.600
and it mis-sheathed in mydaughter's bosom!

295
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:54.800
O me! this sight of deathis as a bell,

296
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.230
That warns my old age to asepulchre.

297
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.330
Come, Montague; for thouart early up

298
00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:08.130
To see thy son and heirmore early down.

299
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:13.300
Alas, my liege, my wife isdead to-night;

300
00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.130
Grief of my son's exilehath stopp'd her breath.

301
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.030
What further woe conspiresagainst my age?

302
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.830
Look, and thou shalt see.

303
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.230
O thou untaught! whatmanners is in this?

304
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.700
To press before thy fatherto a grave?

305
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:05.430
Where be these enemies?

306
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.730
Capulet?

307
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.070
Montague.

308
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:13.830
See what a scourge is laidupon your hate,

309
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:18.830
That heaven finds means tokill your joys with love.

310
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.330
And I for winking at yourdiscords too

311
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:25.000
Have lost a brace ofkinsmen: all are punish'd.

312
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:31.530
O brother Montague, giveme thy hand:

313
00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:36.070
This is my daughter'sjointure, for no more

314
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:37.800
Can I demand.

315
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.370
But I can give thee more:

316
00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:43.900
For I will raise herstatue in pure gold;

317
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.800
That whilst Verona by thatname is known,

318
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.730
There shall no figure atsuch rate be set

319
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.130
As that of true andfaithful Juliet.

320
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:56.970
As rich shall Romeo's byhis lady's lie;

321
00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.630
Poor sacrifices of ourenmity!

322
00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:04.370
A glooming peace thismorning with it brings;

323
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:08.630
The sun, for sorrow, willnot show his head:

324
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:13.230
Go hence, to have moretalk of these sad things;

325
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:17.730
Some shall be pardon'd,and some punished:

326
00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.200
For never was a story ofmore woe

327
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.100
Than this of Juliet andher Romeo.

328
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.230
