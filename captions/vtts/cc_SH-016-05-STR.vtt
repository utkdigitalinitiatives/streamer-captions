00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830


2
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.530
What's your will?

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.970
That it will please you

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.430
To give this poor petition to the king,

5
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.070
And aid me with that store of power

6
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.830
you have to come into his presence.

7
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.970
The king's not here.

8
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.400
Not here, sir!

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.470
Not, indeed:

10
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.630
He hence removed last night and with more haste

11
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.030
Than is his use.

12
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.300
Lord, how we lose our pains!

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.700
But this exceeding posting day and night

14
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.630
must wear your spirits low

15
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.870
We can't help it

16
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.170
All's well that ends well, yet,

17
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.800
Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.

18
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.630
I do beseech you, whither is he gone?

19
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.870
Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;

20
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.370
Whither I am going.

21
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.030
I do beseech you, sir,

22
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.270
Since you are like to see the king before me,

23
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.430
Commend the paper to his gracious hand,

24
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.630
Which I presume shall render you no blame

25
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.630
But rather make you thank your pains for it.

26
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.470
I will come after you with what good speed

27
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.300
Our means will make us means.

28
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.970
This I'll do for you.

29
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.170
Good Monsieur Lavache,

30
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.500
give my Lord Lafeu this letter:

31
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.870
I have ere now, sir, been better known to you,

32
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.430
when I have held familiarity with fresher clothes;

33
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.500
but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune's mood,

34
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.300
and smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure.

35
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.030
Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish,

36
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.600
if it smell so strongly as thou speakest of:

37
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.070
Prithee, allow the wind.

38
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.800
Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir;

39
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.500
I spake but by a metaphor.

40
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.800
Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink,

41
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.000
I will stop my nose; or against any man's metaphor.

42
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.370
Prithee, get thee further.

43
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.100
Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.

44
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.000
Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune's close-stool

45
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.730
to give to a nobleman! Look, here he comes himself.

46
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.870
Here is a purr of fortune's, sir,

47
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.530
that has fallen into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure,

48
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.100
and, as he says, is muddied withal:

49
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.730
I do pity his distress and leave him to your lordship.

50
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.400
My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly scratched.

51
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.200
And what would you have me to do?

52
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.270
'Tis too late to pare her nails now.

53
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.930
Wherein have you played the knave with fortune,

54
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.000
that she should scratch you,

55
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.770
who of herself is a good lady

56
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.770
and would not have knaves thrive long under her?

57
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.900
There's a quart d'ecu for you:

58
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.670
let the justices make you and fortune friends:

59
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.170
I am for other business.

60
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.300
I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.

61
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.900
You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't;

62
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.470
save your word.

63
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.530
My name, my good lord, is Parolles.

64
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.570
give me your hand. How does your drum?

65
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.530
O my good lord, you were the first that found me!

66
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.830
Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee.

67
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.130
It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace,

68
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.530
for you did bring me out.

69
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.970
Out upon thee, knave!

70
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.270
dost thou put upon me at once both the office

71
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.430
of God and the devil?

72
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.530
One brings thee in grace and the other brings thee out.

73
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.470
(trumpet sounds)

74
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.500
The king's coming; I know by his trumpets.

75
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.470
Sirrah, inquire further after me;

76
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.430
I had talk of you last night:

77
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.600
though you are a fool and a knave, you shall eat; go to

78
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.600
I praise God for you.

79
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.630
We lost a jewel of her;

80
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.270
and our esteem was made much poorer by it:

81
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.370
but your son, mad in folly, lack'd the sense

82
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.370
to know her estimation home.

83
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.900
'Tis past, my liege;

84
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.900
And I beseech your majesty to make it

85
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.130
Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;

86
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.270
When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,

87
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.000
O'erbears it and burns on.

88
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.830
My honour'd lady,

89
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.530
I have forgiven and forgotten all;

90
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.400
Though my revenges were high bent upon him,

91
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.270
And watch'd the time to shoot.

92
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.800
This I must say,

93
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.100
But first I beg my pardon, the young lord

94
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.600
Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady

95
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.400
Offence of mighty note; but to himself

96
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.270
The greatest wrong of all.

97
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.470
He lost a wife whose beauty did astonish the survey

98
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.070
Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,

99
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.430
Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve

100
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.730
Humbly call'd mistress.

101
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.830
Praising what is lost

102
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.530
Makes the remembrance dear.

103
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.030
Well, call him hither;

104
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.030
We are reconciled,

105
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.300
and the first view shall kill all repetition:

106
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.870
let him not ask our pardon;

107
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.730
The nature of his great offence is dead,

108
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.070
And deeper than oblivion

109
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.200
we do bury the incensing relics of it:

110
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.900
let him approach, a stranger, no offender;

111
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.830
and inform him so 'tis our will he should.

112
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.170
I shall, my liege.

113
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.400
What says he to your daughter? have you spoke

114
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.270
All that he is hath reference to your highness.

115
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.170
Then shall we have a match.

116
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.270
I have letters sent me

117
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.670
That set him high in fame.

118
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.170
He looks well on't.

119
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.430
I am not a day of season,

120
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.670
For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail

121
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.430
In me at once: but to the brightest beams

122
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.370
Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;

123
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.570
The time is fair again.

124
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.230
My high-repented blames,

125
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.500
Dear sovereign, pardon to me.

126
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.370
All is whole;

127
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.300
Not one word more of the consumed time.

128
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.430
Let's take the instant by the forward top;

129
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.900
For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees

130
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.900
The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time

131
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.870
Steals ere we can effect them.

132
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.500
You remember the daughter of this lord?

133
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.230
Admiringly, my liege,

134
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.970
At first I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart

135
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.470
Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue

136
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.000
Where the impression of mine eye infixing,

137
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.930
Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,

138
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.300
Which warp'd the line of every other favour;

139
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.970
Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;

140
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.870
Extended or contracted all proportions

141
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.970
To a most hideous object: thence it came

142
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.770
That she whom all men praised and whom myself,

143
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.570
Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye

144
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.230
The dust that did offend it.

145
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.370
Well excused:

146
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.270
Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,

147
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.270
Destroy our friends and after weep their dust

148
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.730
Our own love waking cries to see what's done,

149
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.570
While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.

150
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:54.270
Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.

151
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.430
Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:

152
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.300
The main consents are had; and here we'll stay

153
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.130
To see our widower's second marriage-day.

154
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.300
Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!

155
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.630
Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!

156
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.870
Come on, my son, in whom my house's name

157
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.830
Must be digested, give a favour from you

158
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.570
To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,

159
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.200
That she may quickly come.

160
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.830
By my old beard,

161
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.000
And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,

162
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.700
Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,

163
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.000
The last that e'er I took her at court,

164
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.800
I saw upon her finger.

165
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.700
Hers it was not.

166
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.900
Let me see it; for mine eye,

167
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.170
While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.

168
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.170
This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,

169
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.700
I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood

170
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.170
Necessitied to help,

171
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.670
that by this token I would relieve her.

172
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.070
Had you that craft, to reave her

173
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.070
Of what should stead her most?

174
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.770
My gracious sovereign,

175
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.370
Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,

176
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.800
The ring was never hers.

177
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.770
Son, on my life,

178
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.400
I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it

179
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.830
At her life's rate.

180
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.100
I am sure I saw her wear it.

181
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.630
You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it

182
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.100
In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,

183
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.900
Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name

184
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.570
Of her that threw it: noble she was,

185
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.000
and thought I stood engaged:

186
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.230
but when I had subscribed to mine own fortune

187
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.970
and inform'd her fully I could not answer

188
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.330
in that course of honour

189
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.070
As she had made the overture, she ceased

190
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.530
In heavy satisfaction

191
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.100
and would never receive the ring again.

192
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.130
Plutus himself,

193
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.100
That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,

194
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.170
Hath not in nature's mystery more science

195
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.530
Than I have in this ring:

196
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.170
'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,

197
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:50.500
Confess 'twas hers,

198
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.800
and by what rough enforcement you got it from her:

199
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.270
she call'd the saints to surety

200
00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.900
That she would never put it from her finger,

201
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.930
Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,

202
00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.870
Where you have never come,

203
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.530
or sent it us upon her great disaster.

204
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.200
She never saw it.

205
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.170
Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;

206
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.670
And makest conjectural fears to come into me

207
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.130
Which I would fain shut out.

208
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.530
If it should prove

209
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:20.000
That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--

210
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.700
And yet I know not:

211
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.600
thou didst hate her deadly,

212
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.300
And she is dead;

213
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.100
which nothing, but to close her eyes myself,

214
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.500
could win me to believe,

215
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:33.500
More than to see this ring. Take him away.

216
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.530
We'll sift this matter further.

217
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:47.100
I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.

218
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.130
Gracious sovereign,

219
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.400
Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:

220
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.770
Here's a petition from a Florentine,

221
00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.770
Who hath for four or five removes come short

222
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.200
To tender it herself.

223
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.630
I undertook it,

224
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.230
Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech

225
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.570
Of the poor suppliant,

226
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.030
who by this I know is here attending:

227
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.930
her business looks in her

228
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.830
With an importing visage; and she told me,

229
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.900
In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern

230
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.930
Your highness with herself.

231
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.270
Upon his many protestations to marry me

232
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.000
when his wife was dead, I blush to say it,

233
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.300
he won me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower:

234
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.070
his vows are forfeited to me,

235
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.270
and my honour's paid to him.

236
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.730
He stole from Florence, taking no leave,

237
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.230
and I follow him to his country for justice:

238
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.130
grant it me, O king! in you it best lies;

239
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.700
otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.

240
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.500
Diana Capilet.

241
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.530
I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair,

242
00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.000
and toll for this: I'll none of him.

243
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.500
The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,

244
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.670
To bring forth this discovery.

245
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:56.670
Seek these suitors:

246
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.770
Go speedily and bring again the count.

247
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.700
I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,

248
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.230
Was foully snatch'd.

249
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.100
Now, justice on the doers!

250
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.830
I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,

251
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.600
And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,

252
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.530
Yet you desire to marry.

253
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.370
What woman's that?

254
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.930
I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,

255
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.230
Derived from the ancient Capilet:

256
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.370
My suit, as I do understand, you know,

257
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.100
And therefore know how far I may be pitied.

258
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.500
I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour

259
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.200
Both suffer under this complaint we bring,

260
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.730
And both shall cease, without your remedy.

261
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.900
Count; do you know these women?

262
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.670
My lord, I neither can nor will deny

263
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.030
But that I know them: do they charge me further?

264
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.870
Why do you look so strange upon your wife?

265
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.870
She's none of mine, my lord.

266
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:52.900
If you shall marry,

267
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.500
You give away this hand, and that is mine;

268
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.270
You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;

269
00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:02.000
You give away myself, which is known mine;

270
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.030
For I by vow am so embodied yours,

271
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.670
That she which marries you must marry me,

272
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.270
Either both or none.

273
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.370
Your reputation comes too short for my daughter;

274
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.670
you are no husband for her.

275
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.100
My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature

276
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.670
Whom sometime I have laugh'd with:

277
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.270
let your highness lay a more noble thought

278
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.230
upon mine honour

279
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.800
Than for to think that I would sink it here.

280
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.400
Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend

281
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.230
Till your deeds gain them:

282
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.630
fairer prove your honour than in my thought it lies.

283
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:28.570
Good my lord,

284
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.000
Ask him upon his oath, if he does think

285
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.170
He had not my virginity.

286
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.100
What say'st thou to her?

287
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.230
She's impudent, my lord,

288
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.300
And was a common gamester to the camp.

289
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.670
He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,

290
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.570
He might have bought me at a common price:

291
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.200
Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,

292
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.570
Whose high respect and rich validity

293
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.230
Did lack a parallel;

294
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:53.770
yet for all that, he gave it to a commoner o' the camp,

295
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.900
If I be one.

296
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.830
He blushes, and 'tis it

297
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.170
Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,

298
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.370
Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,

299
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.670
Hath it been owed and worn.

300
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:11.500
This is his wife; that ring's a thousand proofs.

301
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.100
Methought you said you saw one here in court

302
00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.070
could witness it.

303
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:15.100
I did, my lord,

304
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.130
but loath am to produce so bad an instrument:

305
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.700
his name's Parolles.

306
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.070
I saw the man to-day, if man he be.

307
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.630
Find him, and bring him hither.

308
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.970
What of him?

309
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.700
He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,

310
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.630
With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd;

311
00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.100
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.

312
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.100
Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,

313
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.130
That will speak any thing?

314
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.970
She hath that ring of yours.

315
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:42.530
I think she has: certain it is I liked her,

316
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.430
And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:

317
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.200
She knew her distance and did angle for me,

318
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.730
Madding my eagerness with her restraint,

319
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.400
As all impediments in fancy's course

320
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.630
Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,

321
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.500
Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,

322
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.230
Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;

323
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.030
And I had that which any inferior might

324
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:07.570
At market-price have bought.

325
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.530
I must be patient:

326
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.100
You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,

327
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.730
May justly diet me. I pray you yet;

328
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.670
Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;

329
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.770
Send for your ring, I will return it home,

330
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:22.570
And give me mine again.

331
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.630
I have it not.

332
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.800
What ring was yours, I pray you?

333
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.730
Sir, much like the same upon your finger.

334
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.100
Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.

335
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.130
And this was it I gave him, being abed.

336
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.430
The story then goes false,

337
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:36.970
you threw it him out of a casement.

338
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:38.030
I have spoke the truth.

339
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.170
My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.

340
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:46.070
You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.

341
00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:47.700
Is this the man you speak of?

342
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.070
Ay, my lord.

343
00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:51.100
Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,

344
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.170
Not fearing the displeasure of your master,

345
00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.930
Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,

346
00:14:55.930 --> 00:15:00.470
By him and by this woman here what know you?

347
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.230
So please your majesty, my master hath been an

348
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.930
honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,

349
00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.100
which gentlemen have.

350
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.930
Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?

351
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.070
Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?

352
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.200
How, I pray you?

353
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.200
He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.

354
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.270
How is that?

355
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.370
He loved her, sir, and loved her not.

356
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.800
As thou art a knave, and no knave.

357
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.830
What an equivocal companion is this!

358
00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.170
I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.

359
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:30.070
He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.

360
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.870
Do you know he promised me marriage?

361
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.700
Faith, I know more than I'll speak.

362
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.870
But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?

363
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.800
Yes, so please your majesty.

364
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.370
I did go between them, as I said; but more than that,

365
00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.170
he loved her:

366
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.070
for indeed he was mad for her,

367
00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.870
and talked of Satan an of Limbo

368
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.800
and of Furies and I know not what:

369
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.570
yet I was in that credit with them at that time

370
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.370
that I knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,

371
00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.900
as promising her marriage,

372
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.700
and things which would derive me ill will to speak of;

373
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.700
therefore I will not speak what I know.

374
00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.700
Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say

375
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.470
they are married:

376
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:02.870
but thou art too fine in thy evidence;

377
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.300
therefore stand aside.

378
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.770
This ring, you say, was yours?

379
00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:08.730
Ay, my good lord.

380
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.730
Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?

381
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:13.470
It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.

382
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.700
Who lent it you?

383
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.300
It was not lent me neither.

384
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.100
Where did you find it, then?

385
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.230
I found it not.

386
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.600
If it were yours by none of all these ways,

387
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.800
How could you give it him?

388
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.170
I never gave it him.

389
00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:23.630
This woman's an easy glove, my lord;

390
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.900
she goes off and on at pleasure.

391
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:30.870
This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.

392
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.330
It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.

393
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.070
Take her away; I do not like her now;

394
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.400
To prison with her: and away with him.

395
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.270
Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,

396
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.830
within this hour, thou diest.

397
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.070
I'll never tell you.

398
00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:41.800
Take her away.

399
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.900
I'll put in bail, my liege.

400
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.770
I think thee now some common customer.

401
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.130
By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.

402
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.070
Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?

403
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.930
Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:

404
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.570
He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;

405
00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:03.170
I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.

406
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:06.100
Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;

407
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:10.430
I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.

408
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.800
She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.

409
00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.900
Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:

410
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.800
The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,

411
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.530
And he shall surety me.

412
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.100
But for this lord, who hath abused me,

413
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.270
as he knows himself,

414
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:31.470
Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:

415
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:35.330
He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;

416
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:43.330
And at that time he got his wife with child:

417
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:48.000
Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:

418
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:

419
00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.900
And now behold the meaning.

420
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:38.300
Is there no exorcist

421
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.270
Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?

422
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.600
Is't real that I see?

423
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.330
No, my good lord;

424
00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.870
'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,

425
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.630
The name and not the thing.

426
00:18:51.630 --> 00:19:00.430
Both, both. O, pardon!

427
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:11.030
O my good lord, when I was like this maid,

428
00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.870
I found you wondrous kind.

429
00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.370
There is your ring,

430
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:29.130
and, look you, here's your letter; this it says:

431
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.000
'When from my finger you can get this ring

432
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:41.000
And are by me with child,' etc. This is done:

433
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:46.630
Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?

434
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:52.030
If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,

435
00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:58.000
I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.

436
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.200
If it appear not plain and prove untrue,

437
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.070
Deadly divorce step between me and you!

438
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:19.230
O my dear mother, do I see you living?

439
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:24.970
Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:

440
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.830
Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher:

441
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:37.000
so, I thank thee: wait on me home,

442
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.300
I'll make sport with thee:

443
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:44.200
Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.

444
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.100
Let us from point to point this story know,

445
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.000
To make the even truth in pleasure flow.

446
00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:00.500
If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,

447
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.330
Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;

448
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.170
For I can guess that by thy honest aid

449
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:12.300
Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.

450
00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:17.300
Of that and all the progress, more or less,

451
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.730
Resolvedly more leisure shall express:

452
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:46.600
All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,

453
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:54.270
The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.

454
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.600
