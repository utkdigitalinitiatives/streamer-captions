and evangelical churches

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:18.361

did not.

One of the missteps
of the campaign

00:05:34.512 --> 00:05:37.345
was the assumption made
by the gay community

00:05:37.415 --> 00:05:41.181
that, by framing marriage
equality as a civil right,

00:05:41.252 --> 00:05:44.016
that, automatically,
the African American community

00:05:44.088 --> 00:05:45.521
would overwhelmingly
support it.

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:48.684

is not monolithic.

We're just like
any other community.

To make that assumption was,
I think,

00:05:52.563 --> 00:05:54.554
a critical error
in strategy.

00:10:03.747 --> 00:10:07.308
the citizens of our community
for more than 17 years.

00:10:07.384 --> 00:10:10.047
Despite my service
to my country,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.022
my state, and my community,
I am not afforded the same

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.821
fair, just, and
discrimination—free rights.

00:10:15.893 --> 00:10:18.020
I believe that Maryland
should join the growing number

00:10:18.095 --> 00:10:20.655
of progressive states
that afford equal rights

00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:23.132
to all of its citizens
and I believe that

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.295
it should be sooner,
rather than later.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.169
Please support Senate Bill 241.
Thank you.

00:10:29.239 --> 00:10:30.673
—Thank you, Captain.

00:10:30.741 --> 00:10:33.233
11 News continues to monitor
our big story tonight,

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.937
history in the making
in the state of Maryland.

00:10:35.012 --> 00:10:38.471
Within the last 20 minutes
or so, Governor Martin O'Malley

00:10:38.549 --> 00:10:40.847
signed the same—sex
marriage bill into law.

00:10:40.918 --> 00:10:44.945
[Cheering]

00:10:45.022 --> 00:10:46.649
All of us,
at the end of the day,

00:10:46.724 --> 00:10:49.124
want the same thing
for our children:

00:10:49.193 --> 00:10:50.558
we want them to live

00:10:50.627 --> 00:10:54.621
in a loving, caring,
and committed home

00:10:54.698 --> 00:10:57.634
that is protected equally

00:10:57.701 --> 00:10:59.135
under the law.

00:10:59.203 --> 00:11:01.194
[Cheering]

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.707
KOJO NNAMDI: The Maryland House
of Delegates passed a bill

00:11:46.784 --> 00:11:48.649
that would legalize
same—sex marriage

00:11:48.719 --> 00:11:52.382
by a vote of 72-67,
but many people

00:11:52.456 --> 00:11:53.889
in the state's
religious community,

00:11:53.957 --> 00:11:55.357
especially in
African American churches,

00:11:55.425 --> 00:11:57.485
still oppose gay marriage

00:11:57.561 --> 00:12:00.690
and are filing to continue
their fight against it.

00:12:00.764 --> 00:12:04.098
Opponents say their best hope
for stopping same—sex marriage

00:12:04.168 --> 00:12:05.795
is a statewide referendum.

00:12:05.869 --> 00:12:08.361
Woman and woman

00:12:08.438 --> 00:12:10.430
and man and man.

00:12:10.507 --> 00:12:12.806
—I'm the chairman of the
Maryland Marriage Alliance,

00:12:12.876 --> 00:12:14.310
which is a singular group,

00:12:14.378 --> 00:12:16.175
focused completely
on the marriage issue

00:12:16.246 --> 00:12:17.976
and the "marriage" definition
in the state of Maryland.

00:12:18.048 --> 00:12:21.018
When we saw that marriage
and the definition of "marriage"

00:12:21.084 --> 00:12:23.314
was beginning to be assaulted,
we began saying

00:12:23.387 --> 00:12:24.820
"Oh, we need to do
something about it."

00:12:24.888 --> 00:12:26.481
Come on over and sign
that petition.

00:12:26.557 --> 00:12:30.994
The Bible's very clear:
marriage came from scripture.

00:12:31.061 --> 00:12:33.325
It's a unique relationship
between a man and a woman

00:12:33.397 --> 00:12:35.297
that God establishes
and he defined

00:12:35.365 --> 00:12:36.799
and I don't get
to redefine.

00:12:36.867 --> 00:12:38.630
—It's a signature.

00:12:38.702 --> 00:12:41.330
Our deal is not to put a stop
on somebody's love.

00:12:41.405 --> 00:12:44.170
People can choose to live
however they want to live.

00:12:44.241 --> 00:12:46.573
What we're saying is they
just don't have the right

00:12:46.643 --> 00:12:48.134
to redefine marriage
for everybody.

00:12:54.518 --> 00:12:56.850
Tonight, the 11 News I—Team
discovered that

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.287
most of the money
for the petition drive

00:12:59.356 --> 00:13:00.721
came from out—of—state

00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:02.224
and that one of
the biggest donors

00:13:02.292 --> 00:13:03.885
is pushing a strategy
to drive a wedge

00:13:03.961 --> 00:13:06.157
between gays
and African Americans.

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:10.132
—A recently unsealed federal
court document states...

00:13:26.083 --> 00:13:29.018
This is a strategy recommended
by the petition drive’s

00:13:29.086 --> 00:13:30.280
biggest contributor:

00:13:30.354 --> 00:13:33.016
the National Organization
for Marriage.

00:13:35.225 --> 00:13:37.057
Yeah, I heard about the
documents that were released

00:13:37.127 --> 00:13:38.561
on the National
Organization for Marriage

00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:40.654
and talk about
a wedge strategy.

00:13:40.731 --> 00:13:42.096
Guess what —-

00:13:42.165 --> 00:13:44.134
African Americans were around
a long time before NOM was.

00:13:44.201 --> 00:13:47.694
Doesn't take any outside group
to try and tell them

00:13:47.771 --> 00:13:49.705
or structure
what their beliefs are.

00:13:49.773 --> 00:13:51.138
Their beliefs
are their beliefs.

00:13:51.208 --> 00:13:53.574
They've been that way
for many years.

00:13:53.644 --> 00:13:55.805
They're a singIe—focus
organization that's trying

00:13:55.879 --> 00:13:58.473
to rally around one issue,
in the issue of marriage,

00:13:58.548 --> 00:14:02.918
and, you know, kudos for them
to work on a strategy.

00:14:02.986 --> 00:14:04.716
I would not want to work
with a group

00:14:04.788 --> 00:14:06.756
that doesn't have a strategy,
doesn't have a plan.

00:14:06.823 --> 00:14:10.658
Many people partner with NOM
and they're a strong group.

00:14:14.464 --> 00:14:16.831
Like this?
—Ah, yeah.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.265
I can't see.
—Let me show you, baby.

00:14:18.335 --> 00:14:21.305
Lord, these children today.

00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:23.465
[Laughs]

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.873
You have to mount it

00:14:25.943 --> 00:14:28.070
and then you stick it in,
then you bring it back out.

00:14:28.145 --> 00:14:30.511
Stick it in the hole.
Right. Right.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.071
And then you mount it
together.

00:14:34.584 --> 00:14:37.679
[Hammering]

00:14:37.754 --> 00:14:38.915
That it’?

00:14:38.989 --> 00:14:41.890
—You want to get this on
the hook, not on the nail.

00:14:44.628 --> 00:14:47.222
[Musical ringtone]

00:14:47.297 --> 00:14:49.129
[Musical ringtone]

00:14:55.038 --> 00:14:57.337
After Prop 8,
it was like

00:14:57.407 --> 00:14:59.398
a souI—searching
experience for me.

00:14:59.476 --> 00:15:02.810
I had this yearning
to really understand

00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:05.542
whether we saw ourselves
black, first,

00:15:05.615 --> 00:15:08.551
whether we saw ourselves
black and LGBT,

00:15:08.618 --> 00:15:12.385
or did we understand the
construct of dual oppression.

00:15:12.456 --> 00:15:15.585
And, by October 2009,
I found myself

00:15:15.659 --> 00:15:17.855
as the executive director
and chief executive officer

00:15:17.928 --> 00:15:19.953
of the National
Black Justice Coalition.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:23.295
—You have a call
from the White House.

00:15:23.367 --> 00:15:26.234
Uh...okay.
—Okay, I'll transfer you.

00:15:26.303 --> 00:15:27.827
Yeah, transfer me in,
please.

00:15:27.904 --> 00:15:29.338
All right, I'ma
call you right back.

00:15:29.406 --> 00:15:32.842
I need to take this call.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:41.340
Maryland is going to play out
in a way that will, hopefully,

00:15:41.418 --> 00:15:42.977
correct the wrongs
of California,

00:15:43.053 --> 00:15:46.352
but that's yet to be seen.

00:15:46.423 --> 00:15:49.222
The reality is
that the far right,

00:15:49.292 --> 00:15:51.284
as well as the
African American leadership

00:15:51.361 --> 00:15:52.795
that they've been able
to amass,

00:15:52.863 --> 00:15:54.296
is going to do
what they do.

00:15:54.364 --> 00:15:56.128
They've been doing it
all over the country.

00:15:56.199 --> 00:15:58.190
And they go in the pulpit
and they use the pulpit

00:15:58.268 --> 00:15:59.827
as a space of hate

00:15:59.903 --> 00:16:01.962
to undermine

00:16:02.039 --> 00:16:03.370
people's rights.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.432
—The strategy of the right

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:10.344
has always been
a strategy of fear.

00:16:10.414 --> 00:16:14.282
Not only produce fear,
but to use it skillfully

00:16:14.351 --> 00:16:17.286
to get people of color
to cross over

00:16:17.354 --> 00:16:20.449
and become a part
of the radical right.

00:16:20.524 --> 00:16:25.826
It has happened to us over
and over and over again.

00:16:25.896 --> 00:16:29.195
Cincinnati City Council
voted 7-2

00:16:29.266 --> 00:16:31.792
to pass what was called
the Human Rights Ordinance.

00:16:31.868 --> 00:16:35.202
The purpose of this ordinance
was to elevate

00:16:35.272 --> 00:16:38.105
one’s sexual preference
to protected—class status.

00:16:38.175 --> 00:16:41.372
But many local citizens
were outraged,

00:16:41.445 --> 00:16:46.212
including...

00:16:46.283 --> 00:16:47.716
The Human Rights Ordinance
that was passed

00:16:47.784 --> 00:16:50.048
in November of 1992

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.555
basically said that
you cannot discriminate

00:16:52.622 --> 00:16:56.354
based on housing or jobs.

00:16:56.426 --> 00:17:00.920
It just mirrored what
the 1964 Civil Rights Act did.

00:17:00.997 --> 00:17:03.489
We drafted legislation

00:17:03.567 --> 00:17:05.660
that would change
the city charter,

00:17:05.735 --> 00:17:07.101
that said you cannot
pass any laws

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.605
based on
sexual orientation.

00:17:09.673 --> 00:17:11.732
We had to collect signatures
to put it on the ballot,

00:17:11.808 --> 00:17:14.209
so, obviously, those were
circulated in the churches

00:17:14.277 --> 00:17:16.576
and it was amazing,

00:17:16.646 --> 00:17:19.411
the support we got from the
African American community,

00:17:19.483 --> 00:17:21.883
even Fred Shuttlesworth.

00:17:21.952 --> 00:17:23.818
He was considered one
of the big three

00:17:23.887 --> 00:17:26.413
and he lived herein Cincinnati
and he wanted to help us.

00:17:32.429 --> 00:17:34.022
I know quite a few things

00:17:34.097 --> 00:17:35.895
about fighting
discrimination.

00:17:35.966 --> 00:17:40.767
Cincinnati Issue 3
is not about discrimination.

00:17:40.837 --> 00:17:44.205
This was probably
the highwater mark

00:17:44.274 --> 00:17:46.834
for the African American
community

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.436
and the evangelical
white community,

00:17:49.513 --> 00:17:51.071
to work together
on an issue.

00:17:51.148 --> 00:17:53.548
The biggest tool
we had was

00:17:53.617 --> 00:17:56.279
KZ Smith.

00:17:56.353 --> 00:17:58.753
—Last November,
the voters came out

00:17:58.822 --> 00:18:02.156
and 62% asked to repeal
our Human Rights Ordinance.

00:18:02.225 --> 00:18:03.625
—And that 62%

00:18:03.693 --> 00:18:06.629
against an ordinance
which would have specifically

00:18:06.696 --> 00:18:08.096
protected homosexuals —-

00:18:08.165 --> 00:18:09.723
—Understand —-

00:18:09.799 --> 00:18:11.165
Was voted significantly so

00:18:11.234 --> 00:18:12.964
by the black community,
is that not so’?

00:18:13.036 --> 00:18:14.731
What black people need
to understand is that

00:18:14.804 --> 00:18:17.899
gays are trying to become
the new minority.

00:18:17.974 --> 00:18:21.137
And, if blacks don't wake up,
they'll be back

00:18:21.211 --> 00:18:23.942
on the back
of the bus again.

00:18:24.014 --> 00:18:26.346
It was, to me, in my mind,
trying to legitimize

00:18:26.416 --> 00:18:27.850
the gay lifestyle.

00:18:27.918 --> 00:18:30.182
I was the president of the
Baptist Ministers‘ Conference,

00:18:30.253 --> 00:18:32.085
at the time.

00:18:32.155 --> 00:18:34.089
A group of people had come
to me, asking if I would be

00:18:34.157 --> 00:18:36.023
the spokesperson for it.

00:18:36.092 --> 00:18:39.153
What troubles me is
that people can't believe

00:18:39.229 --> 00:18:41.220
that we actually stood up
for what we believed.

00:18:41.298 --> 00:18:43.391
They think that
we were motivated

00:18:43.466 --> 00:18:45.765
by the religious right,
that we were motivated

00:18:45.835 --> 00:18:48.964
by rich white people coming
into the community

00:18:49.039 --> 00:18:51.838
and telling us what to believe
and what to stand up for,

00:18:51.908 --> 00:18:53.968
versus us thinking
for ourselves

00:18:54.044 --> 00:18:55.671
and believing for ourselves.

00:18:55.745 --> 00:18:59.147
I believed that
homosexuality was wrong

00:18:59.216 --> 00:19:02.947
before I met a Phil Burress
or anybody else.

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:05.283
We knew that, if we
could get the message out

00:19:05.355 --> 00:19:08.689
that the African Americans
were offended by this —-

00:19:08.758 --> 00:19:09.851
not me,

00:19:09.926 --> 00:19:11.360
not the white folk.

00:19:11.428 --> 00:19:13.453
It was too easy
to pigeonhole us

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.862
and saying
we're just hatemongers,

00:19:15.932 --> 00:19:20.199
but when an African American got
up and delivered the message,

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.897
they didn't touch them.

00:19:21.972 --> 00:19:24.167
They didn't say a word about
them. They were afraid of them.

00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:26.232
That's the reason why
we got sexual immorality.

00:19:26.309 --> 00:19:28.573
That's the reason why there's
a rise in the gay agenda.

00:19:28.645 --> 00:19:32.479
—You can be converted!
You were not born that way!

00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:34.540
The black church,
to this day,

00:19:34.618 --> 00:19:37.985
remains fundamentally
conservative.

00:19:38.054 --> 00:19:39.488
You know, we preached
against smoking

00:19:39.556 --> 00:19:41.854
and drinking and drugging,
and even movies.

00:19:41.925 --> 00:19:46.226
The gay thing is something
the black church has not quite

00:19:46.296 --> 00:19:48.628
been able to grapple with.

00:19:48.698 --> 00:19:51.099
We think it's
a white man's disease

00:19:51.167 --> 00:19:52.533
and it was contagious

00:19:52.602 --> 00:19:54.195
[chuckling] and it got
on us, you know’?

00:19:54.271 --> 00:19:55.636
Well, I was already
a part of

00:19:55.705 --> 00:19:57.833
the evangelical fundamentalist
Pentecostal movement

00:19:57.907 --> 00:19:59.671
for generations.

00:19:59.743 --> 00:20:03.145
I stayed in those trenches,
almost until I was 50 years old.

00:20:03.213 --> 00:20:06.706
I'm in a miracle mood.
I'm in a healing mood.

00:20:06.783 --> 00:20:10.947
I knew that white people

00:20:11.021 --> 00:20:14.218
were using their influence
to buy my influence

00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:17.385
with the black church

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.588
to advance their
antigay agenda

00:20:19.663 --> 00:20:21.255
and we bought into it.

00:20:21.331 --> 00:20:23.732
—Our nation is grateful.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.735
There are a few
prominent leaders

00:20:26.803 --> 00:20:28.396
who have a voice
in the media,

00:20:28.471 --> 00:20:31.600
who have been
influenced and embraced

00:20:31.675 --> 00:20:34.735
by nonblack
fundamentalist entities,

00:20:34.811 --> 00:20:37.974
funded, encouraged,

00:20:38.048 --> 00:20:39.709
given positions of
leadership and prominence

00:20:39.783 --> 00:20:41.273
in the political
and religious circles,

00:20:41.351 --> 00:20:44.116
and they're made
into voices of influence.

00:20:45.855 --> 00:20:48.085
—We may face an America,
in 10 years,

00:20:48.158 --> 00:20:50.092
where the problems that are
in the black community

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.492
are in every community
in the land.

00:20:52.562 --> 00:20:55.623
We don't want an America
like that.

00:20:57.033 --> 00:21:00.333
WOMAN: Yeahl Whool

00:21:00.403 --> 00:21:04.135
We helped bring together black,
white, and Hispanic groups

00:21:04.207 --> 00:21:08.007
that already agreed
in principle with each other.

00:21:08.078 --> 00:21:11.605
So we just went
into various cities

00:21:11.681 --> 00:21:13.479
and connected major players
with each other,

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.609
got them talking
the same language,

00:21:15.685 --> 00:21:18.678
and then released them
to do their work.

00:21:18.755 --> 00:21:21.486
—Americans
remain committed

00:21:21.558 --> 00:21:23.321
to the historic
definition of "marriage"

00:21:23.393 --> 00:21:25.259
as the "union between
one man and one woman".

00:21:25.328 --> 00:21:28.355
That hasn't stopped
a handful of unelected,

00:21:28.431 --> 00:21:31.162
unaccountable judges
from trying to force

00:21:31.234 --> 00:21:33.862
their counterfeit version
of marriage on the nation.

00:21:33.937 --> 00:21:35.871
[Cheering]

00:21:35.939 --> 00:21:37.532
[chanting]
No same—sex marriage!

00:21:37.607 --> 00:21:39.598
No same—sex
marriage!

00:21:39.676 --> 00:21:41.769
No same—sex marriage!

00:21:41.845 --> 00:21:44.075
No same—sex
marriage!

00:21:44.147 --> 00:21:46.878
No same—sex marriage!

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:48.315
No same—sex
marriage!

00:21:48.385 --> 00:21:50.376
No same—sex marriage!

00:21:50.453 --> 00:21:52.353
No same—sex
marriage!

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.497
Phew. I look at this,
I look at a big task.

00:22:04.467 --> 00:22:07.437
I know Prince George's County
like the back of my hand.

00:22:07.504 --> 00:22:09.700
Baltimore City, we're in
just about every day.

00:22:09.773 --> 00:22:11.639
The black community is

00:22:11.708 --> 00:22:13.870
the southern central region,
which is all,

00:22:13.943 --> 00:22:18.540
you know,
Baltimore City on down.

00:22:18.615 --> 00:22:20.913
Wife and kids are absolutely
supportive of all of this.

00:22:20.984 --> 00:22:23.419
I mean, they believe in it.
They understand it.

00:22:23.486 --> 00:22:25.352
We have a lot of dialogue.
We've had questions.

00:22:25.422 --> 00:22:27.117
I mean, they asked me,
said "Well, Daddy,

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.954
why don't you just let it go?"
Or, you know,

00:22:29.025 --> 00:22:30.891
"People should live the way
they should, right?"

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.326
I said "Well,
think about it."

00:22:32.395 --> 00:22:33.886
So I try and challenge
them to think.

00:22:33.963 --> 00:22:36.364
You know, if you're
going to be the person

00:22:36.433 --> 00:22:39.664
that gets a news clip and thinks
2 to 3 minutes about this

00:22:39.736 --> 00:22:43.070
and says "Oh, equality sounds
fair. I guess I'll do it,"

00:22:43.139 --> 00:22:45.574
great, your mind's
going to be changed.

00:22:45.642 --> 00:22:48.441
But if you think past
that 5 or 10 minutes

00:22:48.511 --> 00:22:51.037
and start looking
at society at large

00:22:51.114 --> 00:22:53.173
and look at many
other factors,

00:22:53.249 --> 00:22:55.582
you might have a different
thought process on it.

00:22:55.652 --> 00:22:58.212
[Laughs]

00:22:58.288 --> 00:22:59.915
Baltimore County.

00:22:59.989 --> 00:23:01.787
—22,000 Montgomery people

00:23:01.858 --> 00:23:04.293
signed this petition.
We're really proud of that.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.022
—Uh—oh, I said 20,000.
[Laughter]

00:23:06.095 --> 00:23:08.792
We are turning in

00:23:08.865 --> 00:23:10.799
over 162,435

00:23:10.867 --> 00:23:12.767
signatures.

00:23:12.836 --> 00:23:15.066
Now, same—sex marriage
is going to be put to vote

00:23:15.138 --> 00:23:16.765
herein Maryland.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.535
The Maryland Marriage Alliance
announced it submitted

00:23:18.608 --> 00:23:19.973
more than twice
the number needed

00:23:20.043 --> 00:23:21.977
to take this number
to referendum.

00:23:22.045 --> 00:23:23.376
Both supporters and the
opposition recognize

00:23:23.446 --> 00:23:24.880
the powerful voting bloc

00:23:24.948 --> 00:23:26.381
of the African American
community

00:23:26.449 --> 00:23:28.213
and they use
African American spokespeople.

00:23:28.284 --> 00:23:29.877
Because what we are
seeing is that

00:23:29.953 --> 00:23:32.479
countless thousands of
Marylanders around the state

00:23:32.555 --> 00:23:35.081
want to see marriage
go on the ballot,

00:23:35.158 --> 00:23:37.593
but they also want to see it
defined and upheld

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.823
between one man
and one woman.

00:23:40.897 --> 00:23:42.922

Sometimes

00:23:49.672 --> 00:23:53.575
don't fall

00:23:53.643 --> 00:23:55.805
next to the dream

00:23:55.879 --> 00:23:58.143
baby

00:23:58.214 --> 00:24:02.515
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

people of faith —-

00:24:10.527 --> 00:24:12.017
LETTMAN—HICKS: Maryland's
ballot initiative,

00:24:12.095 --> 00:24:13.688
in regards
to marriage equality,

00:24:13.763 --> 00:24:15.754
is going to require
a lot of education.

00:24:15.832 --> 00:24:17.356
It's going to require
a lot of outreach

00:24:17.433 --> 00:24:18.867
within the
black community.

00:24:18.935 --> 00:24:22.599
—One of the questions
in 2004, when Georgia

00:24:22.672 --> 00:24:24.106
was trying to pass
this amendment

00:24:24.173 --> 00:24:29.612
and we completely got lost and
it was embarrassing, really —-

00:24:29.679 --> 00:24:32.341
I did hear from a lot
of black gay people

00:24:32.415 --> 00:24:35.942
who felt that marriage was not
their number—one priority

00:24:36.019 --> 00:24:38.749
and it kind of stopped me,
like, you know,

00:24:38.821 --> 00:24:41.450
"What are you not understanding,
what we need to do."

00:24:41.524 --> 00:24:44.824
So we do need to have
a message out there again

00:24:44.894 --> 00:24:47.454
to people who don't understand
why they can't get married

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.931
or why they should get married
and to understand

00:24:49.999 --> 00:24:52.491
those thousand rights
that we get deprived.

00:24:52.569 --> 00:24:54.298
—But you can't argue
with them

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:55.736
because they'll go
straight into

00:24:55.805 --> 00:24:57.296
economics, education,
—HeaIth, voting.

00:24:57.373 --> 00:25:00.206
employment, and health,
and those things, to them —-

00:25:00.276 --> 00:25:02.711
their argument is those
are more important to me

00:25:02.779 --> 00:25:04.975
than you telling me I have to
go tell this white man

00:25:05.048 --> 00:25:07.312
that we are interested
in getting married.

00:25:07.383 --> 00:25:10.478
When people say those things,
"It's not a black issue,"

00:25:10.553 --> 00:25:11.987
we have to stop them
from saying that,

00:25:12.055 --> 00:25:14.615
that maybe it's not your issue,
but, as a community,

00:25:14.691 --> 00:25:16.352
it is our issue because
there are lots of people

00:25:16.426 --> 00:25:20.488
in our community who want
to engage in gay marriage.

00:25:20.563 --> 00:25:23.965
I agree with both of you.
The one thing I would say

00:25:24.033 --> 00:25:28.163
about that is that riding
the bus in Montgomery in 1955

00:25:28.237 --> 00:25:30.035
could not have been everyone's
top issue, either —-

00:25:30.106 --> 00:25:32.040
—MAN: That's true.

00:25:32.108 --> 00:25:35.442
But they understood the bigger
issue in the macrocosm, that...

00:25:42.619 --> 00:25:44.746
It was one.
It wasn't the only one.

00:25:44.821 --> 00:25:47.756
It certainly wasn't
the most important issue,

00:25:47.824 --> 00:25:51.851
but it was the issue
that carried the day.

00:26:05.041 --> 00:26:06.839
So, before you guys
head out,

00:26:06.909 --> 00:26:09.105
does anybody else
have any questions?

00:26:09.178 --> 00:26:11.670
Who's a first—timer?
—MAN: You're kidding me.

00:26:11.748 --> 00:26:15.150
Yeah! That's right!

00:26:15.218 --> 00:26:16.651
This is going to be
really fun, guys.

00:26:16.719 --> 00:26:18.153
I know you've never
done this before.

00:26:18.221 --> 00:26:21.190
It's going to be a lot of fun.
You are identifying supporters.

00:26:21.257 --> 00:26:23.521
You are getting people
to vote for this bill.

00:26:23.593 --> 00:26:25.959
So we know that, if we don't
reach out to these people,

00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:27.621
who's going to
reach out to these people?

00:26:27.697 --> 00:26:29.130
MAN: Nobody.
—Oh, no, the other side.

00:26:29.198 --> 00:26:30.825
No. Opposition.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.335
So it's important
that we let them know

00:26:33.403 --> 00:26:35.337
what's going on
and how to vote.

00:26:35.405 --> 00:26:37.669
I wanted to just talk
about clipboard control.

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.333
You want to keep your
clipboard to your side

00:26:39.409 --> 00:26:40.808
and you want to keep

00:26:40.877 --> 00:26:42.743
at least a foot space
between you and the person.

00:26:42.812 --> 00:26:44.280
You don't want the person
to open the door

00:26:44.347 --> 00:26:45.746
and you're right here.

00:26:45.815 --> 00:26:47.249
That's not
very welcoming.

00:26:47.316 --> 00:26:48.909
So I want everybody

00:26:48.985 --> 00:26:55.186
to just take
a deep breath —-

00:26:55.258 --> 00:26:56.691
and, yeah,
let's get riled up!

00:26:56.759 --> 00:26:58.284
It's going to be a great day.
Right, guys?!

00:26:58.361 --> 00:26:59.760
Yeah—eah—eah!
—[Cheering]

00:26:59.829 --> 00:27:01.456
Let's go!

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.360
That's what's up, man. This is
my righteous man over here.

00:27:06.436 --> 00:27:07.767
—Okay, are you
registered to vote?

00:27:07.837 --> 00:27:08.827
Nah.

00:27:08.905 --> 00:27:10.498
TAYLOR—HUGHES: How old are you?
-21.

00:27:10.573 --> 00:27:11.938
All right, you got to
get registered to vote.

00:27:12.008 --> 00:27:13.441
We got to get you
registered to vote.

00:27:16.546 --> 00:27:18.707
MASTER: Okay.
Why? What's up?

00:27:18.781 --> 00:27:20.772
That's not cool.
—What made you be gay?

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:23.785
TAYLOR—HUGHES: That's what's up.
—So what made you be straight?

00:27:23.853 --> 00:27:25.651
What made you be gay?
—What made you be straight?

00:27:25.722 --> 00:27:27.883
TAYLOR—HUGHES: The same thing
that made you be straight.

00:27:27.957 --> 00:27:29.391
Same thing.

00:27:29.459 --> 00:27:31.859
—You can't answer
that question —-

00:27:31.928 --> 00:27:33.919
[Laughter]

00:27:33.996 --> 00:27:35.897
I used to not have
the same rights as you,

00:27:35.965 --> 00:27:38.229
but I know that, because
a black man, like yourself,

00:27:38.301 --> 00:27:39.996
stood up for a woman like me,
I know that I got

00:27:40.069 --> 00:27:42.402
the same opportunities,
so you, as a black man,

00:27:42.472 --> 00:27:44.269
have the opportunity
to stand up for somebody else.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.308
Whether you're gay or not,
these are your brothers

00:27:46.375 --> 00:27:48.401
and sisters out here and
they need you to represent.

00:27:48.478 --> 00:27:51.606
Who is you to tell somebody
who they can't have sex with,

00:27:51.681 --> 00:27:53.114
who they can't be with?

00:27:53.182 --> 00:27:55.845
They ain't got that power.
Nobody has that power,

00:27:55.918 --> 00:27:57.409
to say you can't marry
that young lady.

00:27:57.487 --> 00:27:58.920
Who has that power?
Nobody.

00:27:58.988 --> 00:28:00.353
—But you know what?

00:28:00.423 --> 00:28:02.585
Our state has put the power
in your hands

00:28:02.658 --> 00:28:05.059
and so what we need you
to do is vote for it.

00:28:05.128 --> 00:28:07.619
You're going to vote for 6.
—I got you.

00:28:07.697 --> 00:28:10.689
Okay? Vote for 6.
—Do y'all need

00:28:10.767 --> 00:28:12.200
community service hours?
—Yeah.

00:28:12.268 --> 00:28:14.396
You do? All right, y'all
can always volunteer with us

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.336
and get community service hours.
Y'all wanna do that?

00:28:16.405 --> 00:28:18.738
We feed you,
bring you pizza.

00:28:28.184 --> 00:28:29.709
—Prince George's County
will be

00:28:29.786 --> 00:28:31.879
probably one of the most
important counties

00:28:31.954 --> 00:28:35.789
because it's such a centralized
location of black people.

00:28:35.858 --> 00:28:38.088
It is the wealthiest
predominantly black county

00:28:38.161 --> 00:28:40.425
in the entire country.

00:28:40.496 --> 00:28:43.056
It's a really, really nice
part of Maryland

00:28:43.132 --> 00:28:45.465
that people just don't
see too much of.

00:28:45.535 --> 00:28:48.265
I mean, this is

00:28:48.337 --> 00:28:49.930
the black suburbs.

00:28:50.006 --> 00:28:52.304
We are the only state where
a ballot initiative

00:28:52.375 --> 00:28:56.505
has been posed, thus far,
where black people can make

00:28:56.579 --> 00:28:59.412
a significant impact on
the outcome of the election.

00:28:59.482 --> 00:29:04.545
It's mostly Democratic, however,
it's very socially conservative.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.318
I mean, we have a very,
very large

00:29:08.391 --> 00:29:11.326
and very politically active
church community here

00:29:11.394 --> 00:29:13.157
and there will certainly be
a lot of campaign efforts

00:29:13.229 --> 00:29:16.130
to reach out and to polarize
this community

00:29:16.199 --> 00:29:18.827
around the issue
of marriage equality.

00:29:18.901 --> 00:29:22.565
—This is not
a civil rights act.

00:29:22.638 --> 00:29:24.402
MAN: Honk your horn!
Honk your horn

00:29:24.473 --> 00:29:26.942
if you believe!
—[Honk—honk]

00:29:27.009 --> 00:29:29.478
No same—sex marriage
in the state of Maryland!

00:29:29.545 --> 00:29:30.979
—Sitting right there
for us

00:29:31.047 --> 00:29:32.605
to make sure we win
on November 6th.

00:29:32.682 --> 00:29:34.445
Look at that map, 32 times

00:29:34.517 --> 00:29:35.950
where it's gone before
the vote of people.

00:29:36.018 --> 00:29:38.647
It has not lost yet.

00:29:38.721 --> 00:29:40.018
—One of the things that

00:29:40.089 --> 00:29:41.716
the black community
is saying,

00:29:41.791 --> 00:29:44.385
the ones that are in favor
of same—sex marriage,

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.293
is that this is the human-
rights issue of our time.

00:29:47.363 --> 00:29:49.661
Can you talk
about that, please?

00:29:51.868 --> 00:29:55.827
The way I look at civil rights,
in that order, is

00:29:55.905 --> 00:29:58.966
discrimination is based
on something

00:29:59.041 --> 00:30:00.703
that I had no control over.

00:30:00.776 --> 00:30:04.076
I had no control over the fact
that God made me black

00:30:04.146 --> 00:30:05.705
and I had no control over
the fact that God

00:30:05.781 --> 00:30:08.614
made me a female, so,
if you discriminate against me

00:30:08.684 --> 00:30:12.985
on those bases,
but being gay and lesbian,

00:30:13.055 --> 00:30:15.024
to my way of thinking,
is something you chose to do.

00:30:15.091 --> 00:30:17.560
I didn't choose to be
black or female.

00:30:17.627 --> 00:30:20.187
So that's the way
I handle that.

00:30:20.263 --> 00:30:22.356
I don't think it's
a civil rights issue.

00:30:22.431 --> 00:30:23.626
[Applause]

00:30:23.699 --> 00:30:27.363
I'll let y'all answers
these questions. Good.

00:30:35.678 --> 00:30:38.443
Look at that smoke.
Finish that in the oven.

00:30:38.514 --> 00:30:39.675
—Oh, wow.

00:30:39.749 --> 00:30:42.377
You know Darnell —-

00:30:42.451 --> 00:30:44.386
no beef and pork mix over here.

00:30:44.453 --> 00:30:48.356
—Are you kidding me?
Whatever.

00:30:48.424 --> 00:30:49.858
Yeah, so respect
everybody around here.

00:30:49.926 --> 00:30:51.860
—Yeah, you do.

00:30:51.928 --> 00:30:56.490
My husband has just retired
from active duty,

00:30:56.565 --> 00:30:57.931
United States Air Force,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.701
after 25 [sigh] just
amazing years of service

00:31:03.773 --> 00:31:06.242
to the United States
Air Force.

00:31:06.309 --> 00:31:08.504
We have all of his aunties
and cousins in there,

00:31:08.577 --> 00:31:10.443
cooking all the other

00:31:10.513 --> 00:31:12.413
exceptional dishes.

00:31:12.481 --> 00:31:16.782
—Yeah. Good—oId
Southern food.

00:31:16.852 --> 00:31:18.946
I'm making some

00:31:19.021 --> 00:31:20.614
potato salad

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.022
and I'm going to do
some jambalaya.

00:31:23.092 --> 00:31:27.086
I'm making some
buttermilk cornbread,

00:31:27.163 --> 00:31:31.759
some mac 'n' cheese,
fried corn,

00:31:31.834 --> 00:31:37.204
and candied yams the aunties
are supposed to make.

00:31:37.273 --> 00:31:38.968
I didn't hear that.

00:31:39.041 --> 00:31:41.203
You put everybody out the
kitchen, remember?

00:31:41.277 --> 00:31:44.212
She put everybody
out the kitchen.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.807
I came down from
Mason, Tennessee.

00:31:47.883 --> 00:31:51.479
I'm his auntie.
Annie Whitmore.

00:31:51.554 --> 00:31:55.513
Mrs. Annie Whitmore.
My maiden name is Beloit.

00:31:55.591 --> 00:31:57.559
—Auntie, this morning,
you were talking to me

00:31:57.626 --> 00:31:59.458
about your granddaughter,
when we first

00:31:59.528 --> 00:32:01.827
brought up this conversation.
—Uh—huh.

00:32:01.897 --> 00:32:04.196
How old is she?

00:32:04.266 --> 00:32:06.701
—She's 24.

00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:08.794
24?
—Uh—huh.

00:32:08.871 --> 00:32:10.635
And how long ago
did she come out to you?

00:32:10.706 --> 00:32:12.231
—It'II be

00:32:12.308 --> 00:32:15.642
5 years in —-

00:32:15.711 --> 00:32:17.771
AUNTIE: Oh, that's when she
got out of high school.

00:32:17.847 --> 00:32:20.816
—August.
No, July.

00:32:20.883 --> 00:32:22.317
You remember
the date, huh?

00:32:22.385 --> 00:32:23.818
Yeah.
She emailed me

00:32:23.886 --> 00:32:26.514
and she was telling me
that "Granny, I wanted

00:32:26.589 --> 00:32:29.183
to tell you this
before anybody else."

00:32:29.258 --> 00:32:32.489
It hurt, because I'm from
a family that used to tell us

00:32:32.561 --> 00:32:36.589
[sniffIe] all gay people were
going to go to hell, you know?

00:32:36.665 --> 00:32:39.100
And that's what
we was believing.

00:32:39.168 --> 00:32:41.159
But, as I grow older

00:32:41.237 --> 00:32:44.832
and got a really personal
relationship with God,

00:32:44.907 --> 00:32:48.639
I understand that that ain't
for me, to judge her,

00:32:48.711 --> 00:32:53.342
so I told her, I said "Tika,
I don't care which way you go.

00:32:53.416 --> 00:32:55.043
I said "Grandma
gonna love you."

00:32:55.117 --> 00:32:56.642
So,

00:32:56.719 --> 00:33:00.018
I hope that my family —-
I don't really know

00:33:00.089 --> 00:33:02.251
if my family
really accept her.

00:33:02.324 --> 00:33:03.622
D0 y'all?

00:33:03.692 --> 00:33:05.786
—Yeah!

00:33:05.861 --> 00:33:07.295
[Laughter]

00:33:07.363 --> 00:33:09.388
Yeah, the barbecue will be
all right, Dennis.

00:33:09.465 --> 00:33:10.625
[Laughter]

00:33:10.699 --> 00:33:12.395
We don't socialize around
women when they have

00:33:12.468 --> 00:33:13.902
their conversations.
Most of the time,

00:33:13.969 --> 00:33:16.666
men have their conversation
around other men.

00:33:16.739 --> 00:33:18.639
The funny thing is,

00:33:18.707 --> 00:33:21.176
back when I was dating,
that ladies —-

00:33:21.243 --> 00:33:23.337
—Long time ago.
Long, long, long time ago.

00:33:23.412 --> 00:33:24.607
[Laughs]

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.739
—I'II just say it
like this —-

00:33:26.816 --> 00:33:31.185
that they would bring
a gay friend as a litmus test

00:33:31.253 --> 00:33:33.688
to say ''All right,
is he on the downIow?"

00:33:33.756 --> 00:33:36.885
I was like
"What's this all about?"

00:33:36.959 --> 00:33:40.953
Most of us, the black males
that do accept it,

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:43.795
accept it in the context
of a vice.

00:33:43.866 --> 00:33:46.392
You know,
everybody has vices.

00:33:46.469 --> 00:33:49.063
As long as it's
not harmful to me,

00:33:49.138 --> 00:33:52.369
you can keep your vice
to yourself, you know,

00:33:52.441 --> 00:33:54.410
and it's no harm to me,

00:33:54.477 --> 00:33:56.274
we can deal with it.
To be honest with you,

00:33:56.345 --> 00:33:58.177
if you want to say
"scare" or "homophobia",

00:33:58.247 --> 00:34:00.545
it's not how
the gay person

00:34:00.616 --> 00:34:04.644
may influence me, it's how they
may influence my offspring,

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.919
that have not yet developed
their systems of beliefs.

00:34:08.991 --> 00:34:11.619
Being gay
is not contagious.

00:34:11.694 --> 00:34:13.127
—Oh, I know it's not.

00:34:13.195 --> 00:34:14.629
I'm just saying.

00:34:14.697 --> 00:34:16.221
And no one can make
a child gay.

00:34:16.298 --> 00:34:18.164
The heterosexual influence,

00:34:18.234 --> 00:34:20.430
especially in this culture
and society,

00:34:20.503 --> 00:34:23.734
is a million times stronger
than the homosexual influence

00:34:23.806 --> 00:34:25.774
and so your child
being influenced

00:34:25.841 --> 00:34:28.242
by a homosexual experience,
at some point,

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:30.472
and then that one
experience overpowering

00:34:30.546 --> 00:34:33.015
all the other experiences
that they've seen

00:34:33.082 --> 00:34:36.848
from a heterosexual perspective,
it would have to be —-

00:34:36.919 --> 00:34:39.286
the odds are just,
you know, enormous.

00:34:39.355 --> 00:34:43.621
I'm not sure that
that's enough to force —-

00:34:43.692 --> 00:34:45.126
and I will say "force" —-

00:34:45.194 --> 00:34:49.722
to force us to accept
their belief.

00:34:49.798 --> 00:34:51.926
—WeII, anytime you're
talking about change,

00:34:52.001 --> 00:34:53.434
there has to be something
to move it.

00:34:53.502 --> 00:34:54.868
—Yeah, I'm just
saying, well,

00:34:54.937 --> 00:34:57.838
what's the argument
that I should?

00:34:57.907 --> 00:35:00.967
It could be your brother.
It could be your sister.

00:35:01.043 --> 00:35:03.705
—And that's supposed to
make it acceptable to me?

00:35:03.779 --> 00:35:05.213
I know there's probably
still a lot of white folks

00:35:05.281 --> 00:35:07.977
out here today that work
with black folks,

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:09.415
work with people of color,

00:35:09.485 --> 00:35:10.884
who can't stand them,
deep down inside.

00:35:10.953 --> 00:35:13.388
"Oh, my God! I just don't
like them [gasp]"

00:35:13.455 --> 00:35:17.517
but they are in line
with those civil rights.

00:35:17.593 --> 00:35:20.722
Everyone is going along
with the world

00:35:20.796 --> 00:35:24.027
and saying this is okay.
It's not okay.

00:35:24.099 --> 00:35:25.931
The Bible doesn't change.
It stays the same.

00:35:26.001 --> 00:35:27.594
The world may change,

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:30.264
but I'm not willing
to change with the world.

00:35:30.339 --> 00:35:32.637
—Let me ask you a question.
In the Bible,

00:35:32.708 --> 00:35:34.608
there's so many things
that we can say.

00:35:34.677 --> 00:35:38.044
Divorce is reprehensible
in the Bible.

00:35:38.113 --> 00:35:39.945
Women are to be seen
and not heard.

00:35:40.015 --> 00:35:42.041
Black people are supposed
to be slaves.

00:35:42.117 --> 00:35:43.608
All of that's
in the Bible.

00:35:43.686 --> 00:35:47.952
I cannot take God
out of my equation.

00:35:48.023 --> 00:35:49.252
I cannot.

00:35:49.325 --> 00:35:51.225
—I'm not telling you to take
it out of your equation.

00:35:51.293 --> 00:35:53.660
I cannot take it out
of my conversation

00:35:53.729 --> 00:35:56.460
because God
do not make lesbians.

00:35:56.532 --> 00:35:59.262
He —— When —-
There's genders.

00:35:59.335 --> 00:36:01.235
There's genders.
—Gender identity

00:36:01.303 --> 00:36:02.703
and sexual orientation
is two different issues.

00:36:02.771 --> 00:36:04.398
—Okay, yeah, but genders,
I'ma tell you

00:36:04.473 --> 00:36:05.838
how they may become
like that.

00:36:05.908 --> 00:36:07.740
Let me finish because I
certainly did not interrupt you.

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:09.243
—We're going to have the
right to agree to disagree.

00:36:09.311 --> 00:36:11.211
Yes. But let me finish.
—Okay, go ahead. You're right.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.682
So the reality is that,
when you —-

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.718
It's good. We'll take
this up later, but —-

00:36:16.785 --> 00:36:18.617
MAN: Food ready?
—The food's ready, so.

00:36:18.687 --> 00:36:20.121
WOMAN:
Thank you very much.

00:36:20.189 --> 00:36:22.351
—HeaIthy conversation.

00:36:22.424 --> 00:36:25.587
Eh, but do I get a hug?

00:36:25.661 --> 00:36:27.288
I love you.

00:36:27.363 --> 00:36:29.490
—There is going to
always be

00:36:29.565 --> 00:36:31.658
Michelles in the world.
I won't judge her

00:36:31.734 --> 00:36:34.066
and I won't allow her
to judge my community.

00:36:34.136 --> 00:36:36.571
And as long as there's fewer
and fewer of those people,

00:36:36.639 --> 00:36:38.539
my work is done.

00:36:38.607 --> 00:36:40.041
—We come, 0 God,

00:36:40.109 --> 00:36:41.736
to just tell you thank you,
O God.

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:44.245
Thank you, O God,
for everyone

00:36:44.313 --> 00:36:46.179
that's standing around
in this circle, Father.

00:36:46.248 --> 00:36:48.615
Thank you, O God,
for the hands

00:36:48.684 --> 00:36:51.050
that prepared this food for us.
—Thank you.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.385
Thank you, O God, that they
might enjoy the privilege

00:36:54.456 --> 00:36:57.289
that we enjoy.
—Amen!

00:36:57.359 --> 00:36:58.452
WOMAN: Hallelujah!

00:36:58.527 --> 00:37:00.586
Whoo—hoo!

[Singing] It ain't
necessarily so

00:37:05.834 --> 00:37:09.430
it ain't necessarily

00:37:09.505 --> 00:37:11.940
so

00:37:12.007 --> 00:37:15.568
The things
that you're liable

00:37:15.644 --> 00:37:18.204
to read in the Bible

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:23.616
it ain't
necessarily so [Singing ends]

00:37:23.686 --> 00:37:25.381
—Why doesn't the
African American community

00:37:25.454 --> 00:37:27.821
embrace LGBT equality?

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:30.086
It's systemic
within its culture.

00:37:30.159 --> 00:37:33.822
Sexuality in the African
American community is taboo.

00:37:33.896 --> 00:37:35.989
We don't discuss it,
in any form.

00:37:36.065 --> 00:37:38.226
I think it goes
way back to slavery.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.360
I mean, we were beaten,
we were raped,

00:37:40.436 --> 00:37:42.461
we were, you know,

00:37:42.538 --> 00:37:43.971
considered
less than human.

00:37:44.039 --> 00:37:47.168
I think it became our own form
of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell".

00:37:47.242 --> 00:37:49.837
WOMAN: Get the ball!
Get the ball!

00:37:49.912 --> 00:37:55.077
—Whoops!
Not again! Not again!

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:56.641
Here you go.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:03.422
I understand uniquely
our history.

00:38:03.492 --> 00:38:04.755
I struggle

00:38:04.827 --> 00:38:06.727
and some of the things
that actually took place

00:38:06.795 --> 00:38:10.163
to me and to my family
and where they have come from,

00:38:10.232 --> 00:38:13.862
but I can't equate that struggle
to what's going on today.

00:38:19.942 --> 00:38:21.967
When you're talking
about redefining marriage,

00:38:22.044 --> 00:38:24.604
you're talking about
"Who has been the hardest hit

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:28.446
in the issue of family?"
and it is consistently,

00:38:28.517 --> 00:38:30.713
on every measurement that we
look at across our country,

00:38:30.786 --> 00:38:33.221
the African American
community.

00:38:33.288 --> 00:38:36.156
Even when African Americans
were dealing with slavery,

00:38:36.225 --> 00:38:38.557
there were men and women
who were married in that time,

00:38:38.627 --> 00:38:40.118
couldn't get married
in front of others,

00:38:40.195 --> 00:38:42.892
but got married, you know,
in the back room, in a barn,

00:38:42.965 --> 00:38:45.297
or wherever else,
and they jumped the broom.

00:38:45.367 --> 00:38:47.028
But guess what.
They were married

00:38:47.102 --> 00:38:50.436
and sometimes they were
separated and sold

00:38:50.506 --> 00:38:52.497
to break down that family.

00:38:52.574 --> 00:38:54.907
And so what helped them
get through it

00:38:54.977 --> 00:38:56.536
is their strong faith.

00:38:56.612 --> 00:38:59.741
—We know what God's words say.
Regardless of what laws

00:38:59.815 --> 00:39:02.546
they may write, what
public policy may suggest —-

00:39:02.618 --> 00:39:05.485
McCOY: But there is a concept
about what God thinks

00:39:05.554 --> 00:39:06.988
about marriage, is in there,
and the union

00:39:07.055 --> 00:39:09.217
of one man and one woman.
What He's saying is

00:39:09.291 --> 00:39:11.589
lifestyles that are
not productive

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:14.186
and fruitful
and how he designed you

00:39:14.263 --> 00:39:15.321
is wrong.

00:39:15.397 --> 00:39:17.366
—The father's role
and responsibility

00:39:17.433 --> 00:39:20.163
to set —-

00:39:20.235 --> 00:39:22.932
We never had these
"Father Knows Best"—,

00:39:23.005 --> 00:39:25.496
"Leave It to Beaver"—type
families.

00:39:25.574 --> 00:39:29.636
Often, in our families,
we had some of our kids

00:39:29.711 --> 00:39:32.044
stayed with our sister
and, some of them,

00:39:32.114 --> 00:39:33.604
the grandmother
raised them.

00:39:36.585 --> 00:39:39.418
But, yet, in spite
of all of the things

00:39:39.488 --> 00:39:41.217
that we have experienced,

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:46.319
we still managed to eke out
a way to have family,

00:39:46.395 --> 00:39:49.854
in interesting
and extended ways.

00:39:49.932 --> 00:39:53.368
I believe there is a lot in
the African American experience

00:39:53.435 --> 00:39:56.234
that same—gender families
can draw from:

00:39:56.305 --> 00:39:59.570
how to have a family
when you are marginalized.

00:40:02.144 --> 00:40:06.137
Coming from a very, very, very
Christian foster family,

00:40:06.215 --> 00:40:09.378
it was always like "That's
not what the Bible says"

00:40:09.451 --> 00:40:11.886
or, you know, like
"Do you see anybody else

00:40:11.954 --> 00:40:13.387
walking around like that?

00:40:13.455 --> 00:40:16.652
You know, you're not going to
embarrass me when we go out."

00:40:16.725 --> 00:40:19.888
I went to high school with one
of my church members‘ nieces

00:40:19.962 --> 00:40:21.793
because I was really big
into my church

00:40:21.864 --> 00:40:23.491
and so she went back
and told her aunt

00:40:23.565 --> 00:40:27.695
that I was gay and her aunt
pulled me into a closet

00:40:27.769 --> 00:40:29.999
and told me the devil
was trying to use me

00:40:30.072 --> 00:40:33.235
MAN: Oh, wow.
—To take away like my gifts.

00:40:33.308 --> 00:40:36.278
And so then I went into
a deep depression and —-

00:40:36.345 --> 00:40:38.040
—Little did she know, when
she pulled you out the closet,

00:40:38.113 --> 00:40:40.411
she was literally pulling
you out of the closet.

00:40:40.482 --> 00:40:42.382
—She was trying to pull me in.
I had come out.

00:40:42.451 --> 00:40:44.442
She wanted me back in
and it didn't go too well.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.250
I mean, I was outed
to my entire church.

00:40:47.322 --> 00:40:49.086
They really wouldn't
let me participate

00:40:49.157 --> 00:40:52.491
in certain things, unless
I like repudiated my gay,

00:40:52.561 --> 00:40:54.996
and I wasn't able to do that
and so I lost a family

00:40:55.063 --> 00:40:58.090
that I had spent
12 or 13 years creating

00:40:58.166 --> 00:40:59.964
and I've never
found it again.

00:41:00.035 --> 00:41:03.369
Identifying as a Christian now
became a really big struggle

00:41:03.438 --> 00:41:05.771
because I had to overcome
that burden of

00:41:05.841 --> 00:41:10.403
"I am worthy and I am
worthy of God's love

00:41:10.479 --> 00:41:14.347
and I am worthy of
being whole and complete."

00:41:14.416 --> 00:41:16.316
People give up religion.

00:41:16.385 --> 00:41:19.616
They give up when they say
"God doesn't love you

00:41:19.688 --> 00:41:22.885
as you are and God didn't
make you as you are."

00:41:22.958 --> 00:41:25.393
Then to hell
with that God, then.

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:26.894
Then I'm going to love me

00:41:26.962 --> 00:41:28.555
and I'm going to find
people who do love me.

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:30.462

I'm on a spiritual
journey, myself.

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:54.619
Sometimes you got to get
out of your advocacy

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.659
and look at your heart,
yourself, and your spirit

00:41:57.726 --> 00:41:59.160
and focus on yourself

00:41:59.227 --> 00:42:01.992
when you have been put
in a position to lead.

00:42:02.064 --> 00:42:06.091
I strongly believe
in a strong spiritual home

00:42:06.168 --> 00:42:07.601
and a strong
spiritual foundation

00:42:07.669 --> 00:42:11.401
and believe
in being surrounded

00:42:11.473 --> 00:42:12.804
by spiritual leaders

00:42:12.874 --> 00:42:14.968
in a way that
keeps me grounded.

00:42:15.043 --> 00:42:17.410
[Singing starts] I may

00:42:17.479 --> 00:42:19.004

—You know, when we think
about our faith,

00:42:25.153 --> 00:42:29.284
the thing, you know,
at root,

00:42:29.358 --> 00:42:31.553
that we think about
is not only

00:42:31.627 --> 00:42:34.858
Christ sacrificing himself
on our behalf,

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:37.365
but it's also
the Golden Rule, you know:

00:42:37.432 --> 00:42:39.628
"Treat others the way
you'd want to be treated."

00:42:39.701 --> 00:42:42.193
For me, personally,

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:47.174
it is important for me
to go ahead and affirm

00:42:47.242 --> 00:42:51.770
that I think same—sex couples
should be able to get married.

00:43:09.631 --> 00:43:14.967
The president's affirmation
of marriage equaIity's impact

00:43:15.037 --> 00:43:18.530
on the ballot initiative being
pursued in the state of Maryland

00:43:18.607 --> 00:43:20.473
is up for grabs.

00:43:20.542 --> 00:43:22.010
The amount of time
it takes

00:43:22.077 --> 00:43:24.910
for people to evolve,
just like the president,

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.448
I don't know

00:43:26.515 --> 00:43:28.847
if enough time is available,
but, at a minimum,

00:43:28.917 --> 00:43:30.612
people will at least
start talking about it

00:43:30.686 --> 00:43:32.620
in a meaningful,
deliberate way.

00:43:35.357 --> 00:43:37.450
So what's going on,
Morgan State?!

00:43:37.526 --> 00:43:39.221
—[Cheering]

00:43:39.294 --> 00:43:40.921
We at the NAACP,

00:43:40.996 --> 00:43:43.123
for 103 years,
have made it clear

00:43:43.198 --> 00:43:46.498
that we will not tolerate
discrimination, in any form:

00:43:46.568 --> 00:43:49.538
as a race, as a gender,
as a sexual orientation.

00:43:49.604 --> 00:43:51.368
Two people love
each other.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:54.876
The state has no right,
getting in the way.

00:43:59.581 --> 00:44:03.211
I'm joined today by colleagues
from around the country

00:44:03.285 --> 00:44:07.551
to announce our support for the
Civil Marriage Protection Act

00:44:07.622 --> 00:44:09.056
in the state of Maryland.

00:44:09.124 --> 00:44:13.618
There are a range of personal
and theological views

00:44:13.695 --> 00:44:15.163
about same—sex marriage

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:17.722
within this group
and every group of clergy,

00:44:17.799 --> 00:44:21.065
and, yet, we stand united
in the conviction

00:44:21.136 --> 00:44:24.037
that the government
has an obligation

00:44:24.106 --> 00:44:26.301
to protect every person
and every family

00:44:26.374 --> 00:44:27.808
equally under the law,

00:44:27.876 --> 00:44:31.403
without the imposition
of religious dogma.

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.210
I've decided to come out
in support

00:44:34.282 --> 00:44:36.217
of civil marriage
protection

00:44:36.284 --> 00:44:38.446
because I just thought
it was very dangerous

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.216
and very hypocritical
to want to legislate

00:44:41.289 --> 00:44:45.192
some areas of the Bible
and not others.

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.251
It changed the attitudes,

00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:49.388
for people to see

00:44:49.464 --> 00:44:51.899
a pastor of a traditional
black Baptist church

00:44:51.967 --> 00:44:53.764
of 8,000 members

00:44:53.835 --> 00:44:57.203
come out unashamedly
and unapologetically

00:44:57.272 --> 00:44:59.400
in favor of
marriage equality.

00:45:03.145 --> 00:45:04.578
—The black church was

00:45:04.646 --> 00:45:06.580
a place to go when we had
no place else to go.

00:45:06.648 --> 00:45:09.015
It was a place to meet when
we had no place else to meet.

00:45:09.084 --> 00:45:12.053
The leader of the church was
a relatively independent person.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.054
He didn't work for white people.
He worked for the church.

00:45:14.122 --> 00:45:16.887
And he was a figure
of some importance

00:45:16.958 --> 00:45:18.927
because he spoke
to these people

00:45:18.994 --> 00:45:20.427
every Sunday morning.

00:45:20.495 --> 00:45:22.862
He was a guide,
a moral leader, and so on.

00:45:22.931 --> 00:45:25.423
You looked to him for some
guidance on how to behave,

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.469
how to be a person.

00:45:27.536 --> 00:45:29.936
Our organizing, during
the Civil Rights movement,

00:45:30.005 --> 00:45:32.735
often took place
in the churches.

00:45:32.808 --> 00:45:36.300
It was the facilities
that we had control over,

00:45:36.378 --> 00:45:40.747
so there's a natural
relationship between the clergy,

00:45:40.816 --> 00:45:43.979
the church, and the
Civil Rights movement.

00:45:44.052 --> 00:45:47.113
—It has historically been
the center of education

00:45:47.189 --> 00:45:49.055
and information.

00:45:49.124 --> 00:45:53.527
If someone was ill,
if a woman had just had a baby,

00:45:53.595 --> 00:45:58.533
if someone died in the family,
we had, in that organization,

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:01.433
the black church,
people on the ready

00:46:01.503 --> 00:46:04.905
to respond
to those families.

00:46:04.973 --> 00:46:06.600
So we're talking
about community;

00:46:06.675 --> 00:46:08.108
we're talking about
village,

00:46:08.176 --> 00:46:10.941
a sense of belonging,
a sense of

00:46:11.012 --> 00:46:13.641
self—worth and value.

00:46:13.715 --> 00:46:16.343
You could go to a job

00:46:16.418 --> 00:46:18.978
and they'd call you "boy"
or they'd call you "Jim"

00:46:19.054 --> 00:46:22.513
and then you come to
your church and your name is

00:46:22.591 --> 00:46:26.823
Deacon James Jones
and you sit in a seat

00:46:26.895 --> 00:46:30.058
up in the front
with the trustees

00:46:30.131 --> 00:46:31.531
and you drive
your Chevrolet to church

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.125
and you wear your suit

00:46:34.202 --> 00:46:37.536
and you have a place
of prominence

00:46:37.606 --> 00:46:40.837
that the world
doesn't give.

00:46:40.909 --> 00:46:42.934
But the end result
of that is,

00:46:43.011 --> 00:46:46.811
in order, oftentimes, for people
who have been trampled upon

00:46:46.882 --> 00:46:48.816
to feel powerful,

00:46:48.884 --> 00:46:51.785
there's a need to trample
upon someone else.

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:02.462
JACKSON: Don't let people get
you talking about gay rights.

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:04.055
This is not about
a gay right.

00:47:04.132 --> 00:47:08.433
There's a difference between
civil rights and sacred rights.

00:47:08.503 --> 00:47:10.471
—[Cheering]

00:47:12.908 --> 00:47:18.676
—What is happening is
a minority is attempting

00:47:18.747 --> 00:47:23.309
to impose its will
on the majority.

00:47:23.385 --> 00:47:26.013
Time and time again,
these out—of—controI radicals

00:47:26.087 --> 00:47:28.420
go back
to the dusty pages

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:31.858
of the Constitution
and, somehow, in fine print,

00:47:31.927 --> 00:47:34.191
they find a right
for same—sex marriage.

00:47:34.262 --> 00:47:35.696
Honey, it's not in there.

00:47:35.764 --> 00:47:38.096
It's never been written
in the Constitution.

My father, up there,
you know,

00:48:19.941 --> 00:48:23.639
every Sunday,
playing that organ.

00:48:23.712 --> 00:48:25.145
Me, playing the drums.
Actually,

00:48:25.213 --> 00:48:26.704
it used to be down here.

00:48:31.119 --> 00:48:35.784
I used to look up at my dad
while I was playing.

00:48:35.857 --> 00:48:40.090
My mother, in the stands,
you know, coming down to sing.

00:48:40.161 --> 00:48:45.190

at my father's church,

to 4:30 or 5:00.

00:48:53.441 --> 00:48:55.501
I thank God
for my foundation.

00:48:55.577 --> 00:48:59.275
I've always called myself
an artist, from day one.

in our universe.

He's ready to put
a choke hold on the devil!

He's ready
to tell the world

00:49:17.232 --> 00:49:19.428
"I do this
in the name of Jesus!"

And somebody else,
for the first time,

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:50.621
had to take over the choir
at my father's church

00:49:50.698 --> 00:49:53.634
and that was new.
When "Out the Box" came out,

00:49:53.701 --> 00:49:55.533
particularly the song
"Lord Make Me over",

00:49:55.603 --> 00:49:57.230

[Singing] Father,
I let you down

He looked at me and he said
"You did it, bub!

You did it." He always
used to call me "bub".

I just smiled because
it was the first time

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:26.868
I really felt like my dad
validated me.

00:50:26.935 --> 00:50:28.596

"You know what time
it is, right?"

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:45.515
I was getting tired
of playing these games.

00:50:45.587 --> 00:50:48.056
I didn't tell
anyone, but,

00:50:48.123 --> 00:50:50.557
my music started changing
a little bit.

00:50:50.625 --> 00:50:52.150
People started questioning.

00:50:52.227 --> 00:50:54.559
I came out with an EP
called "Rainbow".

the hell does that mean?"

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:02.127

I don't know how to put that.

00:51:41.609 --> 00:51:43.134
[Laughs]
—I'm trying to put it —-

00:51:43.211 --> 00:51:46.078
Are you waiting for
"deliverance"

00:51:46.147 --> 00:51:48.639
from being attracted
to men?

00:51:48.716 --> 00:51:51.777
I'm not sure that's something
I have to be delivered from.

00:51:51.853 --> 00:51:54.413
So everyone can just
breathe and relax

00:51:54.489 --> 00:51:56.184
on your show

00:51:56.257 --> 00:52:01.696
and say "Tonex said yes,
he's attracted to men.

00:52:01.763 --> 00:52:04.994
Yes, he has experienced
gay sex before.

00:52:05.066 --> 00:52:09.230
But that's the least
of who this man of God is."

00:52:09.304 --> 00:52:12.740
[Singing] Make me over, Lord
(make me over again)

00:52:12.807 --> 00:52:14.207
After the Lexi
interview came out,

00:52:14.275 --> 00:52:16.608
the gospel community,
the church community,

00:52:16.678 --> 00:52:18.407
faith—based
community, turned.

00:52:18.479 --> 00:52:20.141
I think a lot ofthem
already knew.

00:52:20.215 --> 00:52:24.151
I told the truth so they
couldn't make it a scandal.

00:52:24.219 --> 00:52:26.710
When you hide shit,
they'll find it,

00:52:26.788 --> 00:52:29.314
especially in this
information age.

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:33.054
[Singing] Jesus healed

00:52:33.127 --> 00:52:35.687
—[sobbing] Our children
are being lost.

00:52:35.763 --> 00:52:40.132
But they're being lost
in the house.

00:52:40.201 --> 00:52:43.296
They're being
lost in the house.

00:52:43.371 --> 00:52:46.568
And they're being turned

00:52:46.641 --> 00:52:50.100
by people
in their generation.

00:52:50.178 --> 00:52:54.046
We talk about
the Tonex situation

00:52:54.115 --> 00:52:56.140
and it is only turning
their hearts

00:52:56.217 --> 00:52:59.210
further away from God

00:52:59.287 --> 00:53:03.280
and making them believe that
such conversation is ''real''

00:53:03.358 --> 00:53:04.985
when it is not real!

00:53:05.059 --> 00:53:06.493
—Amen!
[Applause]

00:53:06.561 --> 00:53:07.994
It is not real!

00:53:08.062 --> 00:53:10.998
God didn't call
this generation

00:53:11.065 --> 00:53:14.126
to such perversion!

00:53:14.202 --> 00:53:16.864
[Singing starts] Ahhh!

00:53:16.938 --> 00:53:18.906
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!

00:53:18.973 --> 00:53:24.571
(Make me over)
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!

00:53:24.646 --> 00:53:29.208
(Make me over)

00:53:29.284 --> 00:53:35.223
(Lord, make me over)

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:36.882
Make me over

00:53:36.958 --> 00:53:39.188
(make me over again)

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:42.594
I'm tired of myself,
I'm tired of my evil ways

00:53:42.664 --> 00:53:45.394
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(make me over again)

00:53:45.466 --> 00:53:47.833
Every day is the same,
time is the same

00:53:47.902 --> 00:53:50.530
—thing is the same
(make me over again)

00:53:50.605 --> 00:53:52.903
And I'm ready
for change, Lord

00:53:52.974 --> 00:53:55.067
create in me
a clean heart

00:53:55.143 --> 00:53:57.475
(Woh) no

00:53:57.545 --> 00:54:00.913
(Oh woh) Is anybody
sick and tired

00:54:00.982 --> 00:54:03.246
of themselves, yeah?

00:54:03.318 --> 00:54:06.082
(Oh oh oh)

00:54:06.154 --> 00:54:09.817
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh!

00:54:09.891 --> 00:54:12.758
ohh oh ahhhh! [Singing ends]

00:54:12.827 --> 00:54:14.318
—Can I give Tonex

00:54:14.395 --> 00:54:16.989
a quick 3 snaps
for his bravery

00:54:17.065 --> 00:54:19.431
in speaking truth
to his power, right?

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.526
Because he spoke to what
a lot of people

00:54:21.602 --> 00:54:23.229
in the black church,
who are artists,

00:54:23.304 --> 00:54:24.738
who are well—known people,

00:54:24.806 --> 00:54:26.467
they are ashamed

00:54:26.541 --> 00:54:28.737
or they are so otherized that
they dare not speak its name

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:30.835
and so I would like
to give him props for that.

00:54:30.912 --> 00:54:34.644
We all know that there are tons
of black gay men in the church

00:54:34.716 --> 00:54:36.149
who are singing
—[Laughter]

00:54:36.217 --> 00:54:38.618
and who are directing
the choirs,

00:54:38.686 --> 00:54:41.087
and what have you,
preaching.

00:54:41.155 --> 00:54:42.589
Like, I mean, I love his music
and I think there are

00:54:42.657 --> 00:54:44.682
so many talented
black gay men like him,

00:54:44.759 --> 00:54:46.921
you know, who look up
to him, you know,

00:54:46.994 --> 00:54:48.622
that we just need
to support

00:54:48.696 --> 00:54:50.960
and the black church
needs to support, too.

00:54:51.032 --> 00:54:54.934
[Singing starts] Start all over,
start all over

00:54:55.002 --> 00:54:58.063
(You're gonna start all over)
start all over

00:54:58.139 --> 00:55:03.168
(You're gonna start all over)
start all over again [Singing ends]

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:09.282
Today, I'm going to see
my foster mother,

00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:11.842
aka Aunt Toni.

00:55:11.919 --> 00:55:15.378
Anytime I go see her, you know,
she asks what I'm doing,

00:55:15.456 --> 00:55:18.289
but I know she doesn't
kind of want to know.

00:55:18.359 --> 00:55:19.827
You know, I'm not going to
tell her, you know,

00:55:19.894 --> 00:55:21.385
"I've been dating this girl
and they're someone

00:55:21.462 --> 00:55:23.158
I really Iike" and I'm not
going to tell her, you know,

00:55:23.231 --> 00:55:25.597
"Oh, I'm making sure that

00:55:25.666 --> 00:55:27.965
gay people have rights
and they can get married

00:55:28.035 --> 00:55:30.504
and asking churches
to support them."

00:55:30.571 --> 00:55:32.665
You know, that's not something
I want to really bring up,

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:34.709
especially in a phone
conversation, with her.

00:55:34.776 --> 00:55:40.112
I'm hoping that, today,
we can start fresh

00:55:40.181 --> 00:55:44.345
and I hope that I can ask
for her acceptance.

00:55:44.419 --> 00:55:47.388
Not tolerance,
but acceptance,

00:55:47.455 --> 00:55:50.584
and, hopefully, work
on our relationship.

00:55:50.658 --> 00:55:52.922
Hey, Aunt Toni.

00:55:52.994 --> 00:55:58.398
—Hey. Good morning.
How are you?

00:55:58.466 --> 00:56:00.434
I'm good. How are you?
—Good, good.

00:56:00.501 --> 00:56:04.631
Good, good. Hey, little man.
Hey, little man.

00:56:04.705 --> 00:56:07.868
C'mere. Anh!
You remember who I am?

00:56:07.942 --> 00:56:10.172
What's my name?
—Karess.

00:56:10.244 --> 00:56:13.305
Yes! What is it?
Auntie Karess.

00:56:13.381 --> 00:56:15.076
Say it.
—Auntie Karess.

00:56:15.149 --> 00:56:16.583
Auntie Karess. Mm!

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:23.682
I know you're a woman of God
and that like

00:56:23.758 --> 00:56:25.226
you've always been
a woman of God

00:56:25.293 --> 00:56:28.729
and you're so faithful
to your religion like

00:56:28.796 --> 00:56:30.560
and I respect that.

00:56:30.631 --> 00:56:34.090
And like I know,
growing up like

00:56:34.168 --> 00:56:37.502
it was like very hard
because I pushed back a lot,

00:56:37.572 --> 00:56:42.669
when it came back
to religion, and like

00:56:42.743 --> 00:56:45.076
especially the gay thing,
we never really talked about.

00:56:45.146 --> 00:56:47.740
I just want to know like
how you feel about that

00:56:47.815 --> 00:56:50.478
and how you feel about me
working on these bills

00:56:50.551 --> 00:56:52.485
to pass like gay rights.

00:56:52.553 --> 00:56:54.146
I know I don't talk
to you that often

00:56:54.222 --> 00:56:56.122
because I know
that you're very busy

00:56:56.190 --> 00:56:59.592
and, as far as your lifestyle,
is your lifestyle.

00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:02.528
I know, whatever
choice that you make,

00:57:02.597 --> 00:57:04.929
you're making
the right choice.

00:57:04.999 --> 00:57:08.663
—Do you honestly believe
it's a choice?

00:57:08.736 --> 00:57:12.297
Do you honestly believe that
I choose to be hated

00:57:12.373 --> 00:57:14.341
and I choose to —-

00:57:14.408 --> 00:57:16.934
to be something that...?
—Do you choose to?

00:57:17.011 --> 00:57:18.877
I believe that you —-
—[Boy speaks]

00:57:18.946 --> 00:57:20.744
I believe that —-

00:57:20.815 --> 00:57:26.549
I believe some people
are born that way.

00:57:26.621 --> 00:57:29.590
—Do you believe
I was born that way?

00:57:29.657 --> 00:57:31.125
I don't know.

00:57:31.192 --> 00:57:33.456
I can't answer that.
I really, honestly don't know.

00:57:33.528 --> 00:57:36.691
It's not a choice for me.

00:57:36.764 --> 00:57:41.031
It's who I am and like I've
consistently been this person.

00:57:41.102 --> 00:57:45.232
Even when I was a child,
I wore boys‘ clothing.

00:57:45.306 --> 00:57:47.240
—No, forget
boys‘ clothing.

00:57:47.308 --> 00:57:48.742
But I've been gay.

00:57:48.809 --> 00:57:50.641
—How did you know
that you was gay?

00:57:50.711 --> 00:57:52.611
I've known since
I was like four.

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.045
—Are you serious?

00:57:54.115 --> 00:57:55.639
Yeah. This isn't
a lifestyle.

00:57:55.716 --> 00:57:57.480
My sexual orientation
is who I am.

00:57:57.552 --> 00:57:58.985
I've always been this way

00:57:59.053 --> 00:58:00.987
and I always wanted
to talk to you about it.

00:58:01.055 --> 00:58:03.490
Even what I'm doing
is against your religion.

00:58:03.558 --> 00:58:06.288
—I love you
unconditionally.

00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:09.125
Like I said, you're going to
do what you want to do.

00:58:09.196 --> 00:58:12.963
You're grown.
Even if you wasn't grown,

00:58:13.034 --> 00:58:15.696
you still was gonna do
what you wanna do.

00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:19.399
—Part of the reason
why I moved so far away:

00:58:19.473 --> 00:58:21.271
because I felt like
I couldn't be myself,

00:58:21.342 --> 00:58:24.175
because I thought that
I would shame you.

00:58:24.245 --> 00:58:27.340
—You thought
you would shame me?

00:58:27.415 --> 00:58:32.045
Oh, Karess.
—[SniffIe]

00:58:32.119 --> 00:58:33.553
Please stop crying.

00:58:33.621 --> 00:58:37.216
—No, it was just really
important to me

00:58:37.291 --> 00:58:40.022
You didn't shame me.
—to not make you mad.

00:58:40.094 --> 00:58:43.155
You didn't make me mad
and you didn't shame me.

00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:46.792
I'm proud of you.
Very proud of you.

00:58:46.867 --> 00:58:49.962
But I still want some
grandbabies. [laughs]

00:58:50.037 --> 00:58:52.336
—You're going to get
some grandbabies.

00:58:52.406 --> 00:58:54.306
You're going to
get some grandbabies.

00:58:54.375 --> 00:58:56.070
—All right.

00:58:56.143 --> 00:58:58.703
[SniffIe] Just when I get
the money for them.

00:58:58.779 --> 00:59:00.338
[ChuckIe]
—Okay.

00:59:09.657 --> 00:59:12.649
There's always been this debate
around the clobber passages,

00:59:12.727 --> 00:59:14.991
you know, the 5 to 6
passages of the Bible,

00:59:15.062 --> 00:59:18.123
and deconstructing what they
say about homosexuality.

00:59:18.199 --> 00:59:21.862
What I see
in scripture are

00:59:21.936 --> 00:59:26.100
condemnations of

00:59:26.173 --> 00:59:29.234
acts of violence,
of sexual violence,

00:59:29.310 --> 00:59:32.211
and abuse in Romans
and Corin.

00:59:32.279 --> 00:59:35.147
In Sodom and Gomorrah,
for example.

00:59:35.216 --> 00:59:38.618
And I just have
personally not seen

00:59:38.686 --> 00:59:42.247
any explicit condemnations
of same—gender love.

00:59:42.323 --> 00:59:44.348
What's killing us right now
is that those are

00:59:44.425 --> 00:59:46.393
the conversations that
are not taking place.

00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:49.794
—And what I'm worried about is:
by lack of having

00:59:49.864 --> 00:59:52.663
those conversations,
are we being naive,

00:59:52.733 --> 00:59:56.533
to think that those
3 to 5 pastors,

00:59:56.604 --> 00:59:59.004
the vocal minority,
don't have an influence?

00:59:59.073 --> 01:00:01.269
Because those same
3 to 5 pastors

01:00:01.342 --> 01:00:05.472
had signature drives and I
heard, in certain churches,

01:00:05.546 --> 01:00:07.674
those lines were wrapped
around the church,

01:00:07.748 --> 01:00:09.808
with people signing
those petitions.

01:00:09.884 --> 01:00:13.047
So when you go unchallenged,
what is going to

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:16.579
stop those people from going
into the ballot booth

01:00:16.657 --> 01:00:20.218
and voting against
marriage equality?

01:00:27.435 --> 01:00:29.130
Yes, ma'am.
—Can you give me an estimate

01:00:29.203 --> 01:00:32.730
of the number of people
all these churches represent?

01:00:32.807 --> 01:00:35.606
—[Discussing]

01:00:35.676 --> 01:00:37.303
That's a good question.

01:00:37.378 --> 01:00:39.244
—That's
a good question.

01:00:39.313 --> 01:00:42.044
I'm going to
collectively say —-

01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:46.747
just collectively,
because you have so many

01:00:46.821 --> 01:00:49.756
representations
of groups of people

01:00:49.824 --> 01:00:52.691
and presidents of organizations,
and stuff like that —-

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.558
I'll easily say
half a million people.

01:00:54.628 --> 01:00:56.028
Easily say
half a million.

01:00:56.097 --> 01:00:59.931
You know, I wish I could
calculate, but look here —-

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.869
I hope we represent 1.6 million
votes on November 6.

01:01:03.938 --> 01:01:05.405
[Laughter]

01:01:19.954 --> 01:01:22.855
Head west
on Greenbelt Road.

01:01:26.727 --> 01:01:28.593
So my mom earIy—voted.

01:01:28.662 --> 01:01:30.096
Everyone in my family's
already voted

01:01:30.164 --> 01:01:33.930
and my mom, she just didn't
answer Question 6.

01:01:34.001 --> 01:01:38.029
l was hurt.

01:01:38.105 --> 01:01:41.268
That you say you want me
to be happy,

01:01:41.342 --> 01:01:45.870
but you can't vote
to support my happiness.

01:01:45.946 --> 01:01:49.314
And then, after
thinking about it,

01:01:49.383 --> 01:01:54.412
it occurred to me that maybe
she's just not there yet.

01:01:56.624 --> 01:01:57.989
[Knocking]
—We're stopping by today

01:01:58.058 --> 01:01:59.492
to see if you support
marriage equality

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:00.994
for gay and lesbian couples.
—No.

01:02:01.061 --> 01:02:02.757
Okay, sir,
would you mind —-

01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:16.834
Do you support marriage
equality here in Maryland?

01:02:16.911 --> 01:02:18.139
—No.

01:02:18.212 --> 01:02:20.738
Okay. Would you mind saying
why you don't support it?

01:02:22.483 --> 01:02:23.916
You know President Obama
came out in support

01:02:23.984 --> 01:02:27.477
of marriage equality.

01:02:27.555 --> 01:02:29.989
Well, thank you so much
for your time.

01:02:30.057 --> 01:02:32.424
Have a good day.
—Good day to you.

01:02:36.864 --> 01:02:40.425
Make sure, on Tuesday, you take
your soul to the polls. Amen?

01:02:40.501 --> 01:02:42.435
Make sure you do that.

01:02:44.805 --> 01:02:46.569
I believe this election
is going to be

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.870
a referendum on the church.

01:02:48.943 --> 01:02:51.241
It's going to be a referendum
on black preachers.

01:02:51.312 --> 01:02:53.246
We've got to choose

01:02:53.314 --> 01:02:56.772
between the politics
of inclusion [inhale],

01:02:56.851 --> 01:02:58.216
on the one hand,

01:02:58.285 --> 01:03:01.687
or the politics of exclusion
[inhale], on the other hand.

01:03:01.755 --> 01:03:04.588
We are stronger,
as a society [inhale],

01:03:04.658 --> 01:03:07.355
when people of all backgrounds
[inhale], all opinions [inhale],

01:03:07.428 --> 01:03:10.557
all races, all colors,
all religions,

01:03:10.631 --> 01:03:12.793
all sexual orientations,

01:03:12.867 --> 01:03:15.335
get equal treatment
under the law.

01:03:15.402 --> 01:03:19.703
[Applause]

01:03:19.773 --> 01:03:23.972
[Singing starts] —This land is your land

01:03:24.044 --> 01:03:26.946
this land is
my land [Singing ends]

01:03:27.014 --> 01:03:31.417
—I'm very anxious
to just get out there

01:03:31.485 --> 01:03:33.977
and knock out this last day,
this final day

01:03:34.054 --> 01:03:36.114
that I've been working for
for years.

01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:40.286
The adrenaline in me right now
is just on a million. [chuckle]

01:03:40.361 --> 01:03:41.794
I'm just ready to go
knock this day out.

01:03:41.862 --> 01:03:43.956
I'm ready for this day
to be over with.

01:03:44.031 --> 01:03:47.296
I'm ready to win.
I'm ready to make history.

01:03:47.368 --> 01:03:50.633
[sigh] I'm just ready.

01:03:50.704 --> 01:03:53.003
—No matter the outcome
of this election,

01:03:53.073 --> 01:03:54.735
the conversation
has started

01:03:54.808 --> 01:03:57.175
and that's what's
the most rewarding.

01:03:57.244 --> 01:04:00.305
Really educating people
that this is another part

01:04:00.381 --> 01:04:01.712
of the narrative
of the black family,

01:04:01.782 --> 01:04:03.409
that hasn't been
talked about

01:04:03.484 --> 01:04:05.646
in a healthy,
constructive manner.

01:04:12.159 --> 01:04:13.650
I'm pretty sure
we'll do it this time.

01:04:13.727 --> 01:04:16.321
I think Maryland's
going to pull through.

01:04:16.397 --> 01:04:18.126
Marylanders are going to
vote from their gut

01:04:18.198 --> 01:04:19.689
and it's going to happen.

01:04:25.839 --> 01:04:27.239
—Well, at this point,

01:04:27.308 --> 01:04:29.902
everybody's done
what they've done.

01:04:29.977 --> 01:04:32.241
Democracy prevails,
so everybody gets a chance

01:04:32.313 --> 01:04:34.281
to have their say
in the public square.

01:04:34.348 --> 01:04:36.146
—We hope you'll support
Question 6 on marriage equality.

01:04:36.216 --> 01:04:38.048
That's all right, there, sir.
Thank you, though.

01:04:38.118 --> 01:04:39.780
Appreciate it.
—Yeah. Thank you.

01:04:39.853 --> 01:04:42.118
[Laughs]

01:04:42.189 --> 01:04:44.624
—Good morning.

01:04:44.692 --> 01:04:46.387
Nah, I just noticed
how they have one

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:49.361
with the big ol' Michelle Obama
face on there.

01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:52.194
Here we go, saying
"This is a black issue."

01:04:52.266 --> 01:04:54.132
It has to be
all black people, huh?

01:04:54.201 --> 01:04:55.293
It's amazing.

01:04:55.369 --> 01:04:56.700
You try and take
black people

01:04:56.770 --> 01:04:58.363
like we don't have
any sense.

01:04:58.439 --> 01:05:00.100
There's a lot of people
to think

01:05:00.174 --> 01:05:01.698
on the issue

01:05:01.775 --> 01:05:03.937
and so they're going to have
different opinions,

01:05:04.011 --> 01:05:06.104
which is what
democracy's about.

01:05:09.316 --> 01:05:11.751
No problem. Take care.
—[Musical ringtone]

01:05:11.819 --> 01:05:14.310
Take a right, right turn
onto county road.

01:05:14.388 --> 01:05:17.414
[Musical ringtone]
—This is ridiculous right now.

01:05:17.491 --> 01:05:18.890
I need an assistant!

01:05:18.959 --> 01:05:22.589
I mean, there's a lot at stake
here, if we don't win.

01:05:22.663 --> 01:05:24.324
I mean, the governor
really pushed for this bill,

01:05:24.398 --> 01:05:25.866
the black community
stepped up,

01:05:25.933 --> 01:05:27.457
and then,
there's just the couples

01:05:27.534 --> 01:05:29.298
who have been trying
to get married for years,

01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:34.501
that, you know, they took off
from work days to testify.

01:05:34.575 --> 01:05:36.338
Even if we win,
we're not going to stop.

01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:38.071
We're going to keep pushing
for, you know, adoption laws.

01:05:38.145 --> 01:05:39.510
We're going to
start pushing

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:41.946
for more
antidiscrimination laws.

01:05:42.016 --> 01:05:44.746
So, I mean, no matter what,
win or lose, it's not over.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.150
I can't believe they got
this place set up like this.

01:05:49.223 --> 01:05:51.248
I can't even believe that
we have this much democracy

01:05:51.325 --> 01:05:54.624
going on in this
little cuI—de—sac.

01:05:54.695 --> 01:05:59.860
How are two consenting adults
violating your household,

01:05:59.933 --> 01:06:02.425
your love,
your individualism,

01:06:02.503 --> 01:06:05.199
because they've made
a commitment to each other?

01:06:05.272 --> 01:06:06.569
What's the number—one thing
been hurting

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.268
the African American community?
It's the family.

01:06:09.343 --> 01:06:11.277
You saying "Well, now,

01:06:11.345 --> 01:06:14.280
what I want to do is now say
let me redefine the family."

01:06:14.348 --> 01:06:16.111
Vote for Question 6.

01:06:16.183 --> 01:06:19.847
Vote fairness and equality
for all Maryland families.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.718
Remember to vote
for Question 6!

01:06:27.394 --> 01:06:28.760
What do you say after
they say

01:06:28.829 --> 01:06:30.228
"I already voted"?
—"Thank you."

01:06:30.297 --> 01:06:31.731
''Tell your friends
and family members

01:06:31.799 --> 01:06:35.132
to vote for
marriage equality."

01:06:35.202 --> 01:06:37.330
You know this already.

01:06:37.404 --> 01:06:39.304
Our volunteers, you know,
I'm trying to rev them up,

01:06:39.373 --> 01:06:43.833
but, I mean, they've been
out here since 6:30 am,

01:06:43.911 --> 01:06:46.175
so, you know,
they're kind of tired.

01:06:46.246 --> 01:06:48.272
I need you to act like this is
something you care about.

01:06:48.348 --> 01:06:50.044
Do you care about this?
—Yes.

01:06:50.117 --> 01:06:52.176
How long you been doing this?
—A year.

01:06:52.252 --> 01:06:54.084
Act like it.

01:06:54.154 --> 01:06:57.283
All righty. Well.

01:06:57.357 --> 01:06:58.916
—I'm catching the news,

01:06:58.992 --> 01:07:02.485
early polling, which is, so far,
they haven't gotten out, yet.

01:07:08.802 --> 01:07:11.203
—That's right, Denise,
those opponents are

01:07:11.271 --> 01:07:13.365
the Maryland
Family Alliance.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:14.874
They want to stop history
from being made.

01:07:14.942 --> 01:07:16.808
They don't want
Question 6 passed.

01:07:16.877 --> 01:07:18.675
They don't want to see
same—sex marriage in Maryland.

01:07:18.745 --> 01:07:20.839
They believe that it is
a threat to marriage,

01:07:20.914 --> 01:07:22.780
in general,
in the state.

01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:24.511
Derek McCoy leads
this organization out here.

01:07:24.585 --> 01:07:27.076
About 700 people
have been invited

01:07:27.154 --> 01:07:28.485
to come out here
to this event tonight.

01:07:28.555 --> 01:07:29.886
We'll see what happens.

01:07:29.957 --> 01:07:33.393
—EarIy polls, they were up,
and we've closed that gap.

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:35.326
MAN: Well,
they got 49-51.

01:07:35.395 --> 01:07:37.762
—What's that again?

01:07:37.831 --> 01:07:41.267
They haven't updated this
for quite some time.

01:07:43.203 --> 01:07:44.296
Of course,

01:07:44.371 --> 01:07:46.772
it depends on
how the vote turns out,

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.571
so a few minutes ago —-
—Fingers crossed.

01:07:49.643 --> 01:07:51.611
We're looking at mostly
early—voting numbers

01:07:51.678 --> 01:07:54.443
with a small number of votes
that were cast today

01:07:54.515 --> 01:07:56.710
and it's up, statewide,

01:07:56.783 --> 01:07:58.445
by about 8 points,

01:07:58.519 --> 01:08:00.919
by about 54-46.

01:08:00.988 --> 01:08:03.752
It's 50-50
in Baltimore County.

01:08:03.824 --> 01:08:05.451
It's up huge
in Montgomery County

01:08:05.526 --> 01:08:08.120
and it's holding its own
in Prince George's.

01:08:08.195 --> 01:08:11.221
69% of people
support gay marriage.

01:08:14.868 --> 01:08:17.132
Let's show
Question 6 again.

01:08:17.204 --> 01:08:18.637
All the other questions
are done.

01:08:18.705 --> 01:08:21.334
-3 minutes.
—I got to go back.

01:08:21.408 --> 01:08:25.311
Maryland —— historic moment —-
has approved same—sex marriage.

01:08:25.379 --> 01:08:27.211
Question number 6 in Maryland,

01:08:27.281 --> 01:08:29.909
that is a "yes".

01:08:29.983 --> 01:08:33.215
We are standing here
as equal citizens.

01:08:33.287 --> 01:08:36.154
[Cheering]

01:08:55.976 --> 01:08:57.740
[Crying]
—This is it.

01:08:57.811 --> 01:09:00.474
Oh, my gosh.
Yes, thank you so much.

01:09:00.547 --> 01:09:03.016
—Yeah—eah—eah!

01:09:03.083 --> 01:09:05.450
Yeah!

01:09:05.519 --> 01:09:06.884
[clapping]

01:09:06.954 --> 01:09:08.683
—Good job, girl.

01:09:08.755 --> 01:09:10.621
All right, Candace, yes!

01:09:10.691 --> 01:09:12.284
—[Laughs]
C'mere, Qui.

01:09:12.359 --> 01:09:14.657

Mom!

—Yeah—eah!

01:09:26.907 --> 01:09:28.670
Yes!

01:09:28.742 --> 01:09:30.233
Yes, we can!

The Maryland
Marriage Alliance,

01:09:40.954 --> 01:09:43.582
those responsible for getting
Question 6 on the ballot,

01:09:43.657 --> 01:09:45.284
are not willing
to concede.

01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:46.758
Derek McCoy joins us.

01:09:46.827 --> 01:09:49.193
Those numbers have widened
a little bit.

01:09:49.263 --> 01:09:51.390
At this point,
what's your decision now?

01:09:51.465 --> 01:09:53.626
—Well, we're just
not conceding, as of yet.

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:55.430
We just want to make sure that
everything's fully counted

01:09:55.502 --> 01:09:57.027
and that the absentee
ballots are counted

01:09:57.104 --> 01:09:58.571
and we just understand
what's going on.

01:09:58.639 --> 01:10:01.301
So it's real close and we
knew it was going to be

01:10:01.375 --> 01:10:03.104
a real close race
and so we just want

01:10:03.176 --> 01:10:04.667
to make sure that's done,
first.

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.882
—If the majority
is allowed

01:10:15.956 --> 01:10:17.389
to have its way,

01:10:17.457 --> 01:10:20.552
the minority will never
have its rights.

01:10:20.627 --> 01:10:23.563
We fought. We won.
We're still winning.

01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:27.260
As we continue,
state—by—state,

01:10:27.334 --> 01:10:29.894
by—state—by—state,

01:10:29.970 --> 01:10:31.699
church—by—church,

01:10:31.772 --> 01:10:34.434
denomination-
by—denomination,

01:10:34.508 --> 01:10:39.741
we will see that this last,
in so many ways,

01:10:39.813 --> 01:10:43.647
bastion of prejudice
and hatred will also fall.

01:10:43.717 --> 01:10:45.276
I'm feeling wonderful.
I'm feeling great.

01:10:45.352 --> 01:10:47.912
I'm feeling —— this is the
happiest day of my life.

01:10:47.988 --> 01:10:50.184
I have a president who
supports me.

01:10:50.257 --> 01:10:52.749
I have a state
who supports me.

01:10:52.826 --> 01:10:55.386
I have a cause that
I worked very hard for

01:10:55.462 --> 01:10:58.090
and I'm successful.
I mean, in my mind,

01:10:58.165 --> 01:10:59.792
it's just like ''Tell me
what I can't do right now."

01:10:59.866 --> 01:11:02.426
This country is going to
know what it means

01:11:02.502 --> 01:11:04.698
for equality for all.

of another fold

01:11:11.545 --> 01:11:14.480
then we must reach out

01:11:14.548 --> 01:11:18.245
to all souls

01:11:18.318 --> 01:11:21.117
Our wool is black

01:11:21.188 --> 01:11:25.090
but not
our souls

Jesus will never

let you go

the people,

01:11:41.608 --> 01:11:45.568
declare, today, that
the most evident of truths,

01:11:45.645 --> 01:11:48.774
that all of us
are created equal,

01:11:48.849 --> 01:11:51.978
is the star
that guides us still,

01:11:52.052 --> 01:11:53.781
just as it guided
our forebearers

01:11:53.854 --> 01:11:56.846
through Seneca Falls
and Selma and Stonewall,

01:11:56.923 --> 01:12:00.018
just as it guided all those
men and women, sung and unsung,

01:12:00.093 --> 01:12:03.461
who left footprints
along this great Mall

01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:04.861
to hear a preacher say

01:12:04.931 --> 01:12:07.366
that we cannot walk
alone...

01:12:07.434 --> 01:12:09.095
Our journey
is not complete

01:12:09.169 --> 01:12:10.603
until our gay
brothers and sisters

01:12:10.670 --> 01:12:14.334
are treated like anyone else
under the law.

01:12:14.408 --> 01:12:16.399
For, if we are truly
created equal,

01:12:16.476 --> 01:12:19.742
then, surely, the love
we commit to one another

01:12:19.813 --> 01:12:21.212
must be equal as well.

(to all souls)
all these suicides
