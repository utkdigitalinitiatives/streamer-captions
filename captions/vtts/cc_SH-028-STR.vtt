00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:51.770


2
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.700
I thought the king had moreaffected

3
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.030
the Duke of Albany thanCornwall.

4
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.570
It did always seem so to us.

5
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.800
But now, in the division of thekingdom,

6
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.300
it appears not which of thedukes he values most,

7
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.600
for equalities are so weighedthat curiosity in neither

8
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.970
can make choice of either'smoiety.

9
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.000
Is not this your son, my lord?

10
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.630
His breeding, sir, hath been atmy charge.

11
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.830
I have so often blushed toacknowledge him

12
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.300
that now I am brazed to it.

13
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.430
I cannot conceive you.

14
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.700
Sir, this young fellow's mothercould,

15
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.930
whereupon she grew round-wombedand had, indeed, sir,

16
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.200
a son for her cradle

17
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.630
ere she had a husband for herbed.

18
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.070
Do you smell a fault?

19
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.770
I cannot wish the fault undone,the issue of it being so proper.

20
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.070
But I have, sir, a son by orderof law,

21
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.530
some year elder than this,

22
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.970
who yet is no dearer in myaccount.

23
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.770
Though this knave came somethingsaucily into the world

24
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.370
before he was sent for, yet washis mother fair.

25
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.200
There was good sport at hismaking,

26
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.370
and the whoreson must beacknowledged.

27
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.400
Do you know this noblegentleman, Edmund?

28
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.430
No, my lord.

29
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.730
My lord of Kent.

30
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.100
Remember him hereafter as myhonorable friend.

31
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.770
My services to Your Lordship.

32
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.700
I must love you and sue to knowyou better.

33
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.470
Sir, I shall study deserving.

34
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.630
He hath been out nine years, andaway he shall again.

35
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.030
The king is coming.

36
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.200
Attend the lords of France andBurgundy, Gloucester.

37
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.970
I shall, my liege.

38
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.770
Meantime, we shall express ourdarker purpose.

39
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.630
Give me the map there.

40
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.770
Know that we have divided inthree our kingdom,

41
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.630
and 'tis our fast intent

42
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.270
to shake all care and businessfrom our age,

43
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.330
conferring them on youngerstrengths

44
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.870
while we unburdened crawl towarddeath.

45
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.430
Our son of Cornwall and you,

46
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.100
our no less loving son ofAlbany,

47
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.970
we have this hour a constantwill

48
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.770
to publish our daughters'several dowers

49
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.200
that future strife may beprevented now.

50
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.130
The princes France and Burgundy,

51
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.030
great rivals in our youngestdaughter's love,

52
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.370
long in our court have madetheir amorous sojourn

53
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.900
and here are to be answered.

54
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.530
Tell me, my daughtersÃ³

55
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.530
since now we will divest us bothof rule,

56
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.870
interest of territory, cares ofstateÃ³

57
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.000
which of you shall we say dothlove us most,

58
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.270
that we our largest bounty mayextend

59
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.070
where nature doth with meritchallenge?

60
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.000
Goneril, our eldest-born, speakfirst.

61
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.670
Sir, I love you more than wordcan wield the matter;

62
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.030
dearer than eyesight, space, andliberty;

63
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.700
beyond what can be valued richor rare;

64
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.970
no less than life, with grace,health, beauty, honor;

65
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.000
as much as child e'er loved orfather found;

66
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.170
a love that makes breath poorand speech unable;

67
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.070
beyond all manner of so much Ilove you.

68
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.430
What shall Cordelia speak?

69
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.430
Love and be silent.

70
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.270
Of all these bounds, even fromthis line to this,

71
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.600
with shadowy forests and withchampaigns riched

72
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.100
with plenteous rivers andwide-skirted meads,

73
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.570
we make thee lady.

74
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.230
To thine and Albany's issues bethis perpetual.

75
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.070
What says our second daughter,

76
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.900
our dearest Regan, wife ofCornwall?

77
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.470
Speak.

78
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.170
I am made of that self metal

79
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.800
as my sister, and prize me ather worth.

80
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.700
In my true heart, I find shenames my very deed of love;

81
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.900
only she comes too short

82
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.300
that I profess myself an enemyto all other joys,

83
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.470
which the most precious squareof sense possesses,

84
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.030
and find I am alone felicitatein your dear highness' love.

85
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.470
Then poor Cordelia.

86
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.670
And yet not so, since I am sure

87
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.200
my love's more ponderous than mytongue.

88
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.370
To thee and thine, hereditaryever,

89
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.970
remain this ample third of ourfair kingdomÃ³

90
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.870
no less in space, validity, andpleasure

91
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.870
than that conferred on Goneril.

92
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:40.100
Now, our joy,

93
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.300
although our last, not least,

94
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.830
to whose young love

95
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.000
the vines of France and milk ofBurgundy

96
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.370
strive to be interested.

97
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:05.370
What can you say to win a thirdmore opulent than your sisters'?

98
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.270
Speak.

99
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.900
Nothing, my lord.

100
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.930
Nothing?

101
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.970
Nothing.

102
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.600
Nothing will come of nothing;speak again.

103
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.470
Unhappy that I am, I cannotheave my heart into my mouth.

104
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.070
I love Your Majesty according tomy bond,

105
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.370
no more nor less.

106
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.730
How, how, Cordelia!

107
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.030
Mend your speech a little, lestyou may mar your fortunes.

108
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.770
Good my lord, you have begot me,bred me, loved me.

109
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.830
I return those duties back asare right fit,

110
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.800
obey you, love you, and mosthonor you.

111
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.070
Why have my sisters husbands ifthey say they love you all?

112
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.500
Haply, when I shall wed, thatlord whose hand

113
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.700
must take my plight

114
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.670
shall carry half my love withhim,

115
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.800
half my care and duty.

116
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.530
Sure, I shall never marry likemy sisters,

117
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.930
to love my father all.

118
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.570
But goes thy heart with this?

119
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.400
Ay, my good lord.

120
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.730
So young and so untender?

121
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.530
So young, my lord, and true.

122
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.170
Let it be so.

123
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.600
Thy truth, then, be thy dower,

124
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.770
for, by the sacred radiance ofthe sun,

125
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.330
the mysteries of Hecate and thenight,

126
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.570
by all the operation of the orbs

127
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.970
from whom we do exist and ceaseto be,

128
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.470
here I disclaim all my paternalcare,

129
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.470
propinquity, and property ofblood

130
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.430
and, as a stranger to my heartand me,

131
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.930
hold thee, from this, forever.

132
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:46.770
The barbarous Scythian, or hethat makes his generation messes

133
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.830
to gorge his appetite, shall tomy bosom be

134
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.570
as well neighbored, pitied, andrelieved

135
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.430
as thou, my sometime daughter.

136
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.470
Good my liege

137
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.330
Peace, Kent!

138
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.830
Come not between the dragon andhis wrath.

139
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.870
I loved her most

140
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.870
and thought to set my rest onher kind nursery.

141
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.800
Hence, and avoid my sight!

142
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.830
So be my grave my peace,

143
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.800
as here I give her father'sheart from her.

144
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.930
Call France! Who stirs?

145
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.400
Call Burgundy.

146
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.330
Cornwall, Albany.

147
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.700
With my two daughters' dowers,digest this third.

148
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:32.230
Let pride, which she callsplainness, marry her.

149
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:36.470
I do invest you jointly with mypower, preeminence,

150
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.470
and all the large effects thattroop with majesty.

151
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.330
Ourself, by monthly course,

152
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.070
with reservation of an hundredknights,

153
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.370
by you to be sustained,

154
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.730
shall our abode make with you bydue turns.

155
00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:56.470
Only we will retain the name andall the addition of a king.

156
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.970
The sway, revenue, execution ofthe rest,

157
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.330
beloved sons, be yours,

158
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.570
which, to confirm, this coronetpart between you.

159
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:07.130
Royal Lear, whom I have everhonored as my king,

160
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.400
loved as my father, as my masterfollowed,

161
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.800
as my great patron thought on inmy prayersÃ³

162
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.630
The bow is bent and drawn; makefrom the shaft.

163
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.900
Let it fall rather,

164
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.100
though the fork invade theregion of my heart.

165
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.600
Be Kent unmannerly when Lear ismad?

166
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.830
What wouldst thou do, old man?

167
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.130
Think'st thou that duty shallhave dread to speak

168
00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.830
when power to flattery bows?

169
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.370
To plainness honor's bound whenmajesty falls to folly.

170
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.200
Reserve thy state

171
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.430
and, in thy best consideration,check this hideous rashness.

172
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.030
Answer my life my judgment,

173
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.570
thy youngest daughter does notlove thee least.

174
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.970
Nor are those empty-hearted

175
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.970
whose low sounds reverb nohollowness.

176
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.330
Kent, on thy life, no more.

177
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.730
My life I never held but as apawn

178
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.900
to wage against thine enemiesnor fear to lose it,

179
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.930
thy safety being motive.

180
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.000
Out of my sight!

181
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.630
See better, Lear, and let mestill remain

182
00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:50.730
the true blank of thine eye.

183
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.200
Now, by Apollo

184
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.330
Now, by Apollo, King, thouswear'st thy gods in vain!

185
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.370
O, vassal! Miscreant!

186
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.730
Dear sir, forbear.

187
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.230
Kill thy physician,

188
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.530
and the fee bestow upon thy fouldisease.

189
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.100
Revoke thy gift

190
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.770
or, whilst I can vent clamorfrom my throat,

191
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.530
I'll tell thee thou dost evil.

192
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.500
Hear me, recreant!

193
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:15.770
On thine allegiance, hear me!

194
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.000
Since thou hast sought to makeus break our vow,

195
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.370
which we durst never yet, and bystrained pride

196
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.600
to come betwixt our sentence andour power,

197
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.600
which nor our nature nor ourplace can bear,

198
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:36.130
our potency made good, take thyreward.

199
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.500
Five days we do allot thee forprovision

200
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.130
to shield thee from disasters ofthe world

201
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.670
and on the sixth to turn thyhated back

202
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.770
upon our kingdom.

203
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.030
If, on the tenth day following,

204
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.230
thy banished trunk be found inour dominions,

205
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.300
the moment is thy death.

206
00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.870
Away!

207
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:06.730
By Jupiter, this shall not berevoked.

208
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.100
Fare thee well, King.

209
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.970
Sith thus thou wilt appear,

210
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:16.130
freedom lives hence, andbanishment is here.

211
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.970
The gods to their dear sheltertake thee, maid,

212
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.600
that justly think'st and hastmost rightly said.

213
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.170
And your large speeches may yourdeeds approve

214
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:37.770
that good effects may springfrom words of love.

215
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:43.070
Thus Kent, O princes, bids youall adieu.

216
00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.800
He'll shape his old course in acountry new.

217
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.170
Here's France and Burgundy, mynoble lord.

218
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.930
My lord of Burgundy, we firstaddress toward you,

219
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:13.470
who, with this king, hathrivaled for our daughter.

220
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:14.730
What, in the least,

221
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.670
will you require in presentdower with her

222
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.070
or cease your quest of love?

223
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.970
Most Royal Majesty, I crave nomore

224
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.430
than hath your highness offered;nor will you tender less.

225
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.430
Right noble Burgundy, when shewas dear to us,

226
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.070
we did hold her so, but now herprice is fallen.

227
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.700
Sir, there she stands.

228
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.400
If aught within this littleseeming substance,

229
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.130
or all of it, with ourdispleasure pieced

230
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.170
and nothing more, may haply likeyour grace,

231
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:48.630
she's there, and she is yours.

232
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.300
I know no answer.

233
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.130
Will you, with these infirmitiesshe owes,

234
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.200
unfriended, new-adopted to ourhate,

235
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.400
dowered with our curse, andstrangered with our oath,

236
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.700
take her or leave her?

237
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.370
Pardon me, royal sir.

238
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:05.470
Election makes not up in suchconditions.

239
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.500
Then leave her, sir, for, by thepower that made me,

240
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.130
I tell you all her wealth.

241
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.900
For you, great king,

242
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.100
I would not from your love makesuch a stray

243
00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.230
to match you where I hate.

244
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.770
Therefore beseech you

245
00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.370
to avert your liking a moreworthier way

246
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.030
than on a wretch whom nature isashamed

247
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.500
almost to acknowledge hers.

248
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.730
This is most strange,

249
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.830
that she, whom even but now wasyour best object,

250
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.900
the argument of your praise,balm of your age,

251
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.100
the best, the dearest,

252
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.670
should in this trice of timecommit a thing so monstrous

253
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.930
to dismantle so many folds offavor.

254
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.400
Sure, her offense must be ofsuch unnatural degree

255
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.900
that monsters it,

256
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.230
or your fore-vouched affectionfall into taintÃ³

257
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.970
which, to believe of her, mustbe a faith

258
00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:55.100
that reason without miracleshould never plant in me.

259
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.600
I yet beseech Your Majesty.

260
00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.800
If for I want that glib and oilyart,

261
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.570
to speak and purpose notÃ³

262
00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:04.970
since what I well intend, I'lldo it before I speakÃ³

263
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.430
that you make known

264
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.500
it is no vicious blot, murder,or foulness,

265
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.730
no unchaste action or dishonoredstep

266
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.230
that hath deprived me of yourgrace and favor.

267
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.300
But even for want of that forwhich I am richer,

268
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.600
a still-soliciting eye

269
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.770
and such a tongue that I am gladI have not,

270
00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.330
though not to have it hath lostme in your liking.

271
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.570
Better thou hadst not been born

272
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.070
than not to have pleased mebetter.

273
00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.170
Is it but this, a tardiness innature,

274
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.730
that often leaves the historyunspoke

275
00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.270
which it intends to do?

276
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.070
My lord of Burgundy, what sayyou to the lady?

277
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:43.030
Love's not love when 'tismingled with regards

278
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.930
that stand aloof from the entirepoint.

279
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.530
Will you have her?

280
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.900
She is herself a dowry.

281
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.930
Royal Majesty,

282
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.470
give but that portion whichyourself proposed,

283
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.700
and here I take Cordelia by thehand,

284
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.400
Duchess of Burgundy.

285
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.670
Nothing.

286
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.330
I have sworn. I am firm.

287
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.630
I am sorry, then, you have solost a father

288
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:21.500
that you must lose a husband.

289
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.870
Peace be with Burgundy.

290
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.330
Since that respects of fortuneare his love,

291
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.500
I shall not be his wife.

292
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:40.330
Fairest Cordelia, that art mostrich, being poor;

293
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:46.170
most choice, forsaken; and mostloved, despised.

294
00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.900
Thee and thy virtues here, Iseize upon.

295
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.900
Be it lawful, I take up what'scast away.

296
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.670
Gods, gods.

297
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.530
'Tis strange that from theircold'st neglect,

298
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.500
my love should kindle toinflamed respect.

299
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.030
Thy dowerless daughter, King,thrown to my chance,

300
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:09.030
is queen of us, of ours, of ourfair France.

301
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.730
Not all the dukes of waterishBurgundy

302
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:15.370
can buy this unprized preciousmaid of me.

303
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:19.600
Bid them farewell, Cordelia,though unkind.

304
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.230
Thou losest here a better whereto find.

305
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.500
Thou hast her, France.

306
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.530
Let her be thine, for we have nosuch daughter,

307
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:34.200
nor shall ever see that face ofhers again.

308
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.600
Therefore, be gone

309
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.000
without our grace, our love, ourbenison.

310
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.100
Come, noble Burgundy.

311
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.800
Bid farewell to your sisters.

312
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.400
The jewels of our father,

313
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.800
with washed eyes, Cordelialeaves you.

314
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.530
I know you what you are

315
00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.200
and, like a sister, am mostloath

316
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.970
to call your faults as they arenamed.

317
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.430
Love well our father.

318
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.730
To your professed bosoms, Icommit him.

319
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.870
But yet, alas, stood I withinhis grace,

320
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.800
I would prefer him to a betterplace.

321
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.000
So farewell to you both.

322
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.730
Prescribe not us our duties.

323
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.330
Let your study be to contentyour lord,

324
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.430
who hath received you atfortune's alms.

325
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.830
You have obedience scanted

326
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.730
and well are worth the want thatyou have wanted.

327
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.100
Time shall unfold what plaitedcunning hides

328
00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:40.200
who covers faults at last withshame derides.

329
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.830
Well may you prosper.

330
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.300
Come, my fair Cordelia.

331
00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.800
Sister, it is not little I haveto say

332
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.800
of what most nearly appertainsto us both.

333
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.970
I think our father will hencetonight.

334
00:18:55.970 --> 00:19:01.370
That is most certain, and withyou.

335
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.430
Next month, with us.

336
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.870
You see how full of changes hisage is.

337
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.870
The observation we have made onit hath not been little.

338
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.870
He always loved our sister best,

339
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:21.130
and with what poor judgment hehath now cast her off

340
00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.930
appears too grossly.

341
00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.630
'Tis the infirmity of his age.

342
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:29.200
Yet he hath ever but slenderlyknown himself.

343
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.370
The best and soundest of histime hath been but rash.

344
00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.830
Then must we look from his age

345
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.130
to receive not alone theimperfections

346
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.370
of long-engraffed condition

347
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.570
but therewithal the unrulywaywardness

348
00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.730
that infirm and choleric yearsbring with them.

349
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.230
Such unconstant starts are welikely to have of him

350
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.630
as this of Kent's banishment.

351
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.670
There is further compliment ofleave-taking

352
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.800
between France and him.

353
00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.970
Pray you, let's hit together.

354
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:05.670
If our father carry authority

355
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.600
with such dispositions as hebears,

356
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.670
this last surrender of his willbut offend us.

357
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.930
We shall further think on it.

358
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.930
We must do something and in theheat.

359
00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:43.030
Thou, Nature, art my goddess.

360
00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:47.030
To thy law my services arebound.

361
00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:51.700
Wherefore should I stand in theplague of custom

362
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.770
and permit the curiosity ofnations to deprive me,

363
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.800
for that I am some 12 or 14moon-shines

364
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.800
lag of a brother?

365
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.200
Why bastard?

366
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.430
Wherefore base

367
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.200
when my dimensions are as wellcompact,

368
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.170
my mind as generous, and myshape as true

369
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.000
as honest madam's issue?

370
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.770
Why brand they us with base,

371
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:18.000
with baseness, bastardy, base,base?

372
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Who, in the lusty stealth ofnature,

373
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.370
take more composition and fiercequality than doth,

374
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:25.800
within a dull, stale, tired bed,

375
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.400
go to the creating a whole tribeof fops

376
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.130
got 'tween asleep and wake?

377
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:37.000
Well, then, legitimate Edgar, Imust have your land.

378
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.530
Our father's love

379
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.900
is to the bastard Edmund as tothe legitimate.

380
00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:46.130
Fine word, "legitimate."

381
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:50.170
Well, my legitimate, if thisletter speed

382
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.170
and my invention thrive,

383
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.630
Edmund the base shall top thelegitimate.

384
00:21:55.630 --> 00:22:00.600
I grow; I prosper.

385
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.930
Now, gods, stand up forbastards.

386
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.330
Kent banished thus.

387
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.230
And France in choler parted.

388
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.630
And the king gone tonight.

389
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.370
Subscribed his power. Confinedto exhibition.

390
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:30.030
All this done upon the gad.

391
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:35.170
Edmund, how now?

392
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:36.630
What news?

393
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:38.500
So please Your Lordship, none.

394
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.670
Why so earnestly seek you to putup that letter?

395
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.900
I know no news, my lord.

396
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.100
What paper were you reading?

397
00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.130
Nothing, my lord.

398
00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:48.400
No?

399
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.670
What needed, then,

400
00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.530
that terrible dispatch of itinto your pocket?

401
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:56.670
The quality of nothing hath notsuch need to hide itself.

402
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:57.930
Let's see.

403
00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:03.100
Come, if it be nothing, I shallnot need spectacles.

404
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.030
I beseech you, sir, pardon me.

405
00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.930
It is a letter from my brotherthat I have not all o'er-read.

406
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.100
And for so much as I haveperused,

407
00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.200
I find it not fit for youro'er-looking.

408
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.900
Give me the letter, sir.

409
00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:21.130
I shall offend either to detainor give it.

410
00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.100
The contents, as in part Iunderstand them,

411
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.170
are to blame.

412
00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:25.830
Let's see. Let's see.

413
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.570
I hope, for my brother'sjustification,

414
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:28.730
he hath writ this

415
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.000
but as an essay or taste of myvirtue.

416
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.200
"This policy and reverence ofage

417
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.830
"makes the world bitter to thebest of our times,

418
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.170
"keeps our futures from us

419
00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:54.730
"till our oldness cannot relishthem.

420
00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.230
"I begin to find an idle andfond bondage

421
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.630
"in the oppression of agedtyranny,

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:02.770
"but as it is suffered.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.270
"Come to me, that of this I mayspeak more.

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:08.370
"If our father should sleep tillI waked him,

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:11.600
"you should enjoy half hisrevenue forever

and live the beloved of yourbrother, Edgar."

428
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.570
Conspiracy?

429
00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:17.800
"...sleep till I waked him,

430
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.900
"you should enjoy half hisrevenue"?

431
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.970
My son Edgar?

432
00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:23.470
Had he a hand to write this,

433
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:25.530
a heart and brain to breed itin?

434
00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.100
When came this to you?

435
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.130
Who brought it?

436
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.930
It was not brought me, my lord.

437
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:31.570
There's the cunning of it.

438
00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:34.200
I found it thrown in at thecasement of my closet.

439
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.530
You know the character to beyour brother's?

440
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:37.870
If the matter were good, mylord,

441
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:39.300
I durst swear it were his.

442
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.170
But in respect of that, I wouldfain think it were not.

443
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:43.230
It is his.

444
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:46.630
It is his hand, my lord.

445
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.200
But I hope his heart is not inthe contents.

446
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.670
Has he never before sounded youin this business?

447
00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:52.930
Never, my lord.

448
00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:56.200
But I have heard him oftmaintain it to be fit

449
00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.100
that sons at perfect age andfathers declined,

450
00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.930
the father should be as ward tothe son

451
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:04.600
and the son manage his revenue.

452
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.670
O villain, villain!

453
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.130
His very opinion in the letter!

454
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:09.600
Abhorred villain!

455
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.100
Unnatural, detested, brutishvillain!

456
00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.830
Worse than brutish!

457
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:16.870
Go, sirrah, seek him.

458
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.700
I'll apprehend him.

459
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.030
Abominable villain!

460
00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:24.030
Where is he?

461
00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:27.300
I do not well know, my lord.

462
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.300
If it shall please you tosuspend your indignation

463
00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.700
against my brother

464
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.770
till you can derive bettertestimony of his intent,

465
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:35.230
you shall run a certain courseÃ³

466
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.230
where, if you violently proceedagainst him,

467
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:38.530
mistaking his purpose,

468
00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.030
it would make a great gap inyour own honor

469
00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:44.070
and shake in pieces the heart ofhis obedience.

470
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:45.900
I dare pawn down my life forhim,

471
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.500
that he hath wrote this to feelmy affection to your honor

472
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.300
and to no other pretense ofdanger.

473
00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.700
Think you so?

474
00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:59.970
If your honor judge it meet, Iwill place you

475
00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:01.530
where you shall hear us conferof this

476
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.400
and, by an auricular assurance,have your satisfaction,

477
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.230
and that with no greater delaythan this very evening.

478
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:08.570
He cannot be such a monster.

479
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.330
Nor is not, sure.

480
00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:12.700
To his father, who so tenderlyand entirely loves him.

481
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.970
Heaven and Earth!

482
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:17.200
Seek him out, Edmund.

483
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.370
Wind me into him, I pray you.

484
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.470
Frame the business after yourown wisdom.

485
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:25.170
I would unstate myself to be ina due resolution.

486
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:26.730
I will seek him, sir, presently,

487
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.430
convey the business as I shallfind means,

488
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:29.900
and acquaint you withal.

489
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:34.930
These late eclipses in the Sunand moon portend no good to us.

490
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.870
Though the wisdom of nature canreason it thus and thus,

491
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:42.330
yet nature finds itself scourgedby the sequent effects.

492
00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:45.170
Love cools, friendship fallsoff,

493
00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.000
brothers divide.

494
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.830
In cities, mutinies; incountries, discord;

495
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:51.830
in palaces, treason.

496
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:55.670
And the bond cracked 'twixt sonand father.

497
00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.630
This villain of mine comes underthe prediction;

498
00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.530
there's son against father.

499
00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:02.070
The king falls from bias ofnature;

500
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:07.430
there's father against child.

501
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:12.370
Oh.

502
00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:17.230
We have seen the best of ourtime.

503
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:20.500
Machinations, hollowness,treachery,

504
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.030
and all ruinous disorders

505
00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:26.830
follow us disquietly to ourgraves.

506
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:30.070
Find out this villain, Edmund.

507
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.100
It shall lose thee nothing.

508
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.800
Do it carefully.

509
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.130
And the noble and true-heartedKent banished.

510
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:45.430
His offense: honesty.

511
00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:49.530
'Tis strange.

512
00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:59.830
This is the excellent foppery ofthe world:

513
00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:02.000
that when we are sick in fortune

514
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.500
often the surfeits of our ownbehaviorÃ³

515
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.830
we make guilty of our disasters

516
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:09.070
the Sun, the moon, and stars

517
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.500
as if we were villains onnecessity;

518
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.770
fools by heavenly compulsion;

519
00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:18.830
knaves, thieves, and treachers,by spherical predominance;

520
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.130
drunkards, liars, and adulterers

521
00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:23.370
by an enforced obedience ofplanetary influence;

522
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:27.100
and all that we are evil in by adivine thrusting on.

523
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.870
An admirable evasion ofwhoremaster man,

524
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:36.630
to lay his goatish dispositionon the charge of a star.

525
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.670
My father compounded with mymother

526
00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:41.630
under the dragon's tail,

527
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:44.730
and my nativity was under Ursamajor,

528
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.800
so that it follows I am roughand lecherous.

529
00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.200
I should have been that I am,

530
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.730
had the maidenliest star in thefirmament twinkled

531
00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.500
on my bastardizing.

532
00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:58.600
Edgar

533
00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:03.100
Pat he comes like thecatastrophe of the old comedy.

534
00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.730
My cue is villainous melancholy,

535
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:09.530
with a sigh like Tom o' Bedlam.

536
00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:19.000
O, these eclipses do portendthese divisions.

537
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.830
How now, brother Edmund?

538
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:30.230
What serious contemplation areyou in?

539
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:31.530
I am thinking, brother,

540
00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:33.370
of a prediction I read thisother day

541
00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:35.370
what should follow theseeclipses.

542
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.970
Do you busy yourself with that?

543
00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:41.770
I promise you, the effects hewrites of succeed unhappily,

544
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:45.670
as of unnaturalness between thechild and the parent;

545
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:51.400
death, dearth, dissolutions ofancient amities;

546
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.670
divisions in state;

547
00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:56.000
menaces and maledictions againstking and nobles;

548
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.830
needless diffidences; banishmentof friends;

549
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:03.300
dissipation of cohorts; nuptialbreaches;

550
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.500
and I know not what.

551
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.400
How long have you been a sectaryastronomical?

552
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.630
Come, come.

553
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.870
When saw you my father last?

554
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:15.500
The night gone by.

555
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.530
Spake you with him?

556
00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:17.970
Ay, two hours together.

557
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:20.730
Parted you in good terms?

558
00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:24.370
Found you no displeasure in himby word nor countenance?

559
00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:25.630
None at all.

560
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:28.730
Bethink yourself wherein you mayhave offended him.

561
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.900
And at my entreaty, forbear hispresence

562
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.930
until some little time hathqualified the heat

563
00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:34.000
of his displeasure,

564
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.670
which, at this instant, sorageth in him

565
00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:39.000
that with the mischief of yourperson,

566
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.030
it would scarcely allay.

567
00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:41.370
Some villain hath done me wrong.

568
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:43.700
That's my fear.

569
00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.670
I pray you, have a continentforbearance

570
00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:48.630
till the speed of his rage goesslower.

571
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:53.000
And, as I say, retire with me tomy lodging,

572
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.870
from whence I will fitly bringyou to hear my lord speak.

573
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.470
Pray ye, go.

574
00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:00.200
There's my key.

575
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.630
If you do stir abroad, go armed.

576
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:03.970
Armed, brother?

577
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:07.070
Brother, I advise you to thebest.

578
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:09.730
I am no honest man if there beany good meaning toward you.

579
00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.570
I have told you what I have seenand heard,

580
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:14.200
but faintly nothing like theimage and horror of it.

581
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.630
Pray you, away.

582
00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:16.730
Shall I hear from you anon?

583
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:20.130
I do serve you in this business.

584
00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:38.270
A credulous father and a brothernoble,

585
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:40.330
whose nature is so far fromdoing harms

586
00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:42.100
that he suspects none,

587
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.530
on whose foolish honesty mypractices ride easy.

588
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:48.900
I see the business.

589
00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.900
Let me, if not by birth, havelands by wit.

590
00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.870
All with me's meet that I canfashion fit.

591
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:06.430
Did my father strike mygentleman

592
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:07.600
for chiding of his fool?

593
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.970
Aye, madam.

594
00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:10.870
By day and night, he wrongs me.

595
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.930
Every hour, he flashes into onegross crime or other

596
00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.930
that sets us all at odds.

597
00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.000
I'll not endure it.

598
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.870
His knights grow riotous,

599
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:20.630
and himself upbraids us on everytrifle.

600
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.970
When he returns from hunting, Iwill not speak with him.

601
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:25.870
Say I am sick.

602
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:28.370
If you come slack of formerservices,

603
00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:29.500
you shall do well.

604
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.570
The fault of it, I'll answer.

605
00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:33.600
He's coming, madam; I hear him.

606
00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.870
Put on what weary negligence youplease,

607
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:37.430
you and your fellows.

608
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:38.770
I'll have it come to question.

609
00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:42.130
If he distaste it, let him to mysister,

610
00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:44.930
whose mind and mine, I know, inthat are one,

611
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:46.970
not to be over-ruled.

612
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:51.600
Idle old man that still wouldmanage

613
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.330
those authorities that he hathgiven away.

614
00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:59.070
Now, by my life, old fools arebabes again

615
00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:01.630
and must be used with checks asflatteries

616
00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:04.230
when they are seen abused.

617
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:05.730
Remember what I have said.

618
00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.070
Well, madam.

619
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.830
And let his knights have colderlooks among you.

620
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.270
What grows of it, no matter.

621
00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:14.430
Advise your fellows so.

622
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.870
I would breed from henceoccasions,

623
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:22.430
and I shall, that I may speak.

624
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.370
I'll write straight to my sister

625
00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:26.630
to hold my very course.

626
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:28.930
Prepare for dinner.

627
00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:35.600
If but as well I other accentsborrow

628
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.530
that can my speech defuse,

629
00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:40.000
my good intent may carry throughitself

630
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.770
to that full issue for which Irazed my likeness.

631
00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.370
Now, banished Kent,

632
00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:52.370
if thou canst serve where thoudost stand condemned,

633
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:56.670
so may it come thy master, whomthou lovest,

634
00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:00.230
shall find thee full of labors.

635
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:08.070
Let me not stay a jot fordinner.

636
00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:10.930
Go, get it ready.

637
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.500
How now?

638
00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.770
What art thou?

639
00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:16.930
A man, sir.

640
00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:18.730
What dost thou profess?

641
00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:19.970
What wouldst thou with us?

642
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:22.000
I do profess to be no less thanI seem,

643
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.200
to serve him truly that will putme in trust,

644
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.900
to love him that is honest,

645
00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.000
to converse with him that iswise and says little,

646
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.400
to fear judgment, to fight whenI cannot choose,

647
00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.270
and to eat no fish.

648
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:33.570
What art thou?

649
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.730
A very honest-hearted fellow andas poor as the king.

650
00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:39.130
If thou be as poor for a subjectas he is for a king,

651
00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:40.430
thou art poor enough.

652
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:41.470
What wouldst thou?

653
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:42.500
Service.

654
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:43.530
Who wouldst thou serve?

655
00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:44.570
You.

656
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:46.470
Dost thou know me, fellow?

657
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:48.300
No, sir; but you have that inyour countenance

658
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.170
that I would fain call master.

659
00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:51.770
What's that?

660
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:53.730
Authority.

661
00:34:57.730 --> 00:34:59.100
What services canst thou do?

662
00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.230
I can keep honest counsel, ride,run,

663
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:03.400
mar a curious tale in tellingit,

664
00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.330
and deliver a plain messagebluntly.

665
00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:07.500
That which ordinary men are fitfor, I am qualified in.

666
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.230
And the best of me is diligence.

667
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:10.470
How old art thou?

668
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:12.300
Not so young, sir, to love awoman for singing,

669
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.600
nor so old to dote on her foranything.

670
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.230
I have years on my back 48.

671
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:17.470
Follow me; thou shalt serve me.

672
00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:18.930
If I like thee no worse afterdinner,

673
00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.670
I shall not part from theebefore.

674
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:24.770
Dinner, ho, dinner!

675
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.270
Where's my knave, my fool?

676
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:28.870
Go you, and call my fool hither.

677
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:31.600
You, you, sirrah, where's mydaughter?

678
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.570
So please you

679
00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:38.130
What says the fellow there?

680
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.870
Call the clodpoll back!

681
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:46.400
Where's my fool, ho-ho-ho?

682
00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:49.600
I think the world's asleep.

683
00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:53.400
How now!

684
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.270
Where's that mongrel?

685
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:57.570
He says, my lord, your daughteris not well.

686
00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.630
Why came not the slave back tome when I called him?

687
00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:02.000
Sir, he answered me in theroundest manner

688
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.070
he would not.

689
00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:07.000
He would not?

690
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.670
My lord, I know not what thematter is.

691
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.030
But to my judgment, yourhighness

692
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:12.130
is not entertained with thatceremonious affection

693
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:13.530
as you were wont.

694
00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:15.700
There's a great abatement ofkindness appears as well

695
00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.930
in the general dependents

696
00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:19.030
as in the duke himself also andyour daughter.

697
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:20.630
Ha! Sayest thou so?

698
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:22.770
I beseech you, pardon me, mylord, if I be mistaken,

699
00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:24.130
for my duty cannot be silent

700
00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:25.600
when I think your highnesswronged.

701
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.830
Thou but rememberest me of mineown conception.

702
00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:31.030
I have perceived a most faintneglect of late,

703
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:34.400
which I have rather blamed asmine own jealous curiosity

704
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.270
than as the very pretense andpurpose of unkindness.

705
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:39.230
I will look further into it.

706
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.370
But where's my fool?

707
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:41.770
I have not seen him this twodays.

708
00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:43.770
Since my young lady's going intoFrance, sir,

709
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:45.230
the fool hath much pined away.

710
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:47.700
No more of that; I have noted itwell.

711
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.170
Go you; tell my daughter I wouldspeak with her.

712
00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:52.830
Go you, and call hither my fool!

713
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:58.270
O, you sir, you!

714
00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:05.500
Come you hither, sir.

715
00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:14.600
Who am I, sir?

716
00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.070
My lady's father.

717
00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:20.530
"My lady's father."

718
00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:23.030
My lord's knave.

719
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:25.300
You whoreson dog, you slave, youcur.

720
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:28.100
I am none of these, my lord; Ibeseech your pardon.

721
00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.770
Do you bandy looks with me, yourascal?

722
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:32.530
I'll not be strucken, my lord.

723
00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:35.370
Nor tripped neither, you basefootball player.

724
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:36.500
I thank thee, fellow.

725
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.200
Thou servest me, and I'll lovethee.

726
00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:41.600
Come, sir. Arise, away.

727
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.470
No, we'll teach you differences.

728
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:45.830
Away, away.

729
00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:47.170
Have you wisdom?

730
00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:49.370
If you will measure yourlubber's length again, tarry.

731
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:51.000
But away.

732
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.700
Go to.

733
00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.400
Now, my friendly knave, I thankthee.

734
00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.330
Here's earnest for thy service.

735
00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:03.930
Let me hire him too: here's mycoxcomb.

736
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:08.370
How now, my pretty knave?

737
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.570
How dost thou?

738
00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:12.430
Sirrah, you were best take mycoxcomb.

739
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:13.830
Why, fool?

740
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:16.670
Why? For taking one's part thatout of favor.

741
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:18.730
Nay, and thou canst not smile asthe wind sits;

742
00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:20.230
thou'lt catch cold shortly.

743
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:21.570
Here, take my coxcomb.

744
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.870
Why, this fellow, he hasbanished two on's daughters

745
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:27.570
and did the third a blessingagainst his will.

746
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:30.700
If thou follow him, thou mustneeds wear my coxcomb.

747
00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.070
How now, nuncle!

748
00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:34.900
Would I had two coxcombs and twodaughters!

749
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.470
Why, boy?

750
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:39.030
If I gave them all me living,I'ld keep my coxcombs myself.

751
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.930
There's mine; beg another of thydaughters.

752
00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:44.900
Take heed, sirrah; the whip.

753
00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.100
Truth's a dog must to kennel.

754
00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.700
He must be whipped out when Ladythe brach

755
00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.930
may stand by the fire and stink.

756
00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:54.500
A pestilent gall to me.

757
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.000
Sirrah, I'll teach thee aspeech.

758
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.170
Do, boy.

759
00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:59.670
Mark it, nuncle.

760
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:04.230
Have more than thou showest,speak less than thou knowest,

761
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:07.830
lend less than thou owest, ridemore than thou goest,

762
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:12.070
learn more than thou trowest,set less than thou throwest;

763
00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:14.500
leave thy drink and thy whore,and keep in-a-door,

764
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.600
and thou shalt have more thantwo tens to a score.

765
00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.000
This is nothing, fool.

766
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.170
Then 'tis like the breath of anunfee'd lawyer;

767
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:22.870
you gave me nothing for it.

768
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:26.000
Can you make no use of nothing,nuncle?

769
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.800
Why, no, boy; nothing can bemade out of nothing.

770
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.900
Prithee, tell him.

771
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.430
So much the rent of his landcomes to.

772
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.730
He'll not believe a fool.

773
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:36.100
A bitter fool.

774
00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.170
Dost know the difference, myboy,

775
00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:40.770
between a bitter fool and asweet one?

776
00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:42.530
No, lad; teach me.

777
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:46.670
That lord that counseled thee togive away thy land,

778
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:50.030
come place him here by me, anddo thou for him stand.

779
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:52.770
The sweet and bitter fool willpresently appear

780
00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:56.570
the one in motley here, theother found out there.

781
00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:58.270
Dost thou call me fool, boy?

782
00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.070
All thy other titles thou hastgiven away

783
00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.530
that thou wast born with.

784
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:05.400
This is not altogether fool, mylord.

785
00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.230
No, faith, lords and great menwill not let me.

786
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:09.730
If I had a monopoly out, they'dhave part on it.

787
00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:13.270
And the ladies too, they'll notlet me have all the fool tomyself;

788
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:14.330
they'd be snatching.

789
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:17.930
-Nuncle. -Huh?

790
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:21.230
Give me an egg, and I'll givethee two crowns.

791
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:22.530
What two crowns shall they be?

792
00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:24.130
Why, when I've cut the egg inthe middle

793
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.230
and eat up the meat, the twocrowns of the egg.

794
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:28.830
When thou clovest thy crown inthe middle

795
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:30.230
and gavest away both parts,

796
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:33.930
thou borest thy ass on thy backo'er the dirt.

797
00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:36.400
Thou hadst little wit in thybald crown

798
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.330
when thou gavest thy golden oneaway.

799
00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:39.600
If I speak like meself in this,

800
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.070
let him be whipped that firstfinds it so.

801
00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:47.000
Fools have ne'er less grace in ayear.

802
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.900
For wise men are grown foppish

803
00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:53.070
and know not how their wits towear.

804
00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:55.930
Their manners are so apish.

805
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.100
When wast thou wont to be sofull of song, sirrah?

806
00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.400
I have used it, nuncle,

807
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.500
ever since thou mad'st thydaughters thy mothers.

808
00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.270
For when thou gavest them therod

809
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:05.500
and putest down thine ownbreeches,

810
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.870
then they for sudden joy didweep

811
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:09.100
and I for sorrow sung

812
00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.800
that such a king should playbo-peep

813
00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.170
and go the fools among.

814
00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:17.830
O nuncle, prithee, keep aschoolmaster

815
00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:20.100
that could teach thy fool tolie.

816
00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.830
I'd fain learn to lie.

817
00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:25.430
And you lie, sirrah, we'll haveyou whipped.

818
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:27.670
I marvel what kin thou and thydaughters are.

819
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:29.370
They'd have me whipped forspeaking true;

820
00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:30.800
thou'st have me whipped forlying;

821
00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.900
sometimes I'm whipped forholding me peace.

822
00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.300
I'd rather be any kind of thingthan a fool.

823
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.730
And yet I would not be thee,nuncle.

824
00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:40.270
Thou hast pared thy wit on bothsides

825
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:42.370
and left nothing in the middle.

826
00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:44.700
Here comes one of the parings.

827
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.600
How now, daughter?

828
00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.430
What makes that frontlet on?

829
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:53.300
You're too much of late in thefrown.

830
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:54.570
Thou wast a pretty fellow

831
00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:56.500
when thou hadst no need to carefor her frowning.

832
00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:57.870
Now thou art an O without afigure.

833
00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:59.730
I am better than thou art now.

834
00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:01.100
I am a fool; thou art nothing.

835
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:03.270
Yes, forsooth, I will hold mepeace.

836
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:05.130
So your face bids me, though yousay nothing.

837
00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:06.270
Mum, mum, mum.

838
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:08.300
He that keeps no crust norcrumb,

839
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.930
weary of all, shall want some.

840
00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:12.230
That's a shealed peasecod.

841
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:15.030
Not only, sir, this yourall-licensed fool,

842
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.170
but other of your insolentretinue

843
00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:19.070
do hourly carp and quarrel,

844
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:22.370
breaking forth in rank andnot-to-be endured riots.

845
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.770
Sir, I had thought, by makingthis well known to you,

846
00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:28.630
to have found a safe redress butnow grow fearful

847
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:31.630
by what yourself too late havespoke and done

848
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:35.370
that you protect their courseand put it on by your allowance,

849
00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:36.630
which, if you should,

850
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:38.900
the fault would not 'scapecensure,

851
00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.030
nor the redresses sleep,

852
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:42.930
which, in the tender of awholesome weal,

853
00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:44.670
might in their working do youthat offense,

854
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:47.030
which else were shame that theirnecessity

855
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:49.100
will call discreet proceeding.

856
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:50.170
For, you trow, nuncle,

857
00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:51.870
the hedge-sparrow fed the cuckooso long,

858
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:54.730
it had its head bit off by itsyoung!

859
00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:57.970
So out went the candle, and wewere left darkling.

860
00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:00.800
Are you our daughter?

861
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.000
I would you would make use ofyour good wisdom,

862
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.670
whereof I know you are fraught,

863
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:07.770
and put away these dispositions

864
00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:10.770
which of late transport you fromwhat you rightly are.

865
00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:13.700
May not the ass know when thecart draws the horse?

866
00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.630
Oh, whoops, Jug.

867
00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:16.670
I love thee.

868
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:18.370
Does any here know me?

869
00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:20.100
This is not Lear.

870
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:23.700
Does Lear walk thus, speak thus?

871
00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.430
Where are his eyes?

872
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:27.200
Either his notion weakens

873
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.570
or his discernings arelethargied.

874
00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.830
Waking? 'Tis not so.

875
00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:33.430
Who is it that will tell me whoI am?

876
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:34.470
Lear's shadow.

877
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:35.900
I would learn that, for by themarks

878
00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.530
of sovereignty, knowledge, andreason,

879
00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:40.430
I should be false persuaded Ihad daughters.

880
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:43.200
Which they will make an obedientfather.

881
00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:49.530
Your name, fair gentlewoman?

882
00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.200
This admiration, sir,

883
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.370
is much o' the savor of otheryour new pranks.

884
00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:58.430
I do beseech you to understandmy purposes aright.

885
00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:04.400
As you are old and reverend,should be wise.

886
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.930
Here you do keep a hundredknights and squiresÃ³

887
00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:09.970
men so disordered, so deboshedand bold

888
00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:12.230
that this our court, infectedwith their manners,

889
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.130
shows like a riotous inn.

890
00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:17.230
Epicurism and lust makes it morelike a brothel or a tavern

891
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:18.500
than a graced palace.

892
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.630
The shame itself doth speak forinstant remedy.

893
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:23.770
Be then desired by her

894
00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:26.400
that else will take the thingshe begs:

895
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.730
a little to disquantity yourtrain

896
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:30.870
and the remainder that shallstill depend

897
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:32.330
to be such men as may besortyour age,

898
00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:34.030
which know themselves and you.

899
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:35.500
Darkness and devils!

900
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.600
Saddle my horses! Call my traintogether!

901
00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.030
Degenerate bastard!

902
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:40.130
I'll not trouble thee.

903
00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:41.800
Yet have I left a daughter.

904
00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.230
You strike my people,

905
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:46.170
and your disordered rabble makeservants of their betters.

906
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:47.400
Woe, that too late repentsÃ³

907
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.530
O, sir, are you come?

908
00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:49.570
Is it your will?

909
00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:50.600
Speak, sir.

910
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.000
Prepare my horses.

911
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.770
Ingratitude, thou marble-heartedfiend,

912
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:56.730
more hideous when thou show'stthee in a child

913
00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:57.770
than the sea-monster.

914
00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:59.030
Pray, sir, be patient.

915
00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.170
Detested kite!

916
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:03.130
Thou liest.

917
00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:05.830
My train are men of choice andrarest parts

918
00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:07.930
who all particulars of dutyknow,

919
00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:09.600
and, with the most exact regard,

920
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.200
support the worships of theirname.

921
00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:15.430
O most small fault,

922
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:18.570
how ugly didst thou in Cordeliashow

923
00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.000
which, like an engine,

924
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.970
wrenched my frame of nature fromthe fixed place,

925
00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:24.970
drew from my heart all love, andadded to the gall.

926
00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:26.130
O Lear, Lear, Lear.

927
00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:27.670
Beat at this gate

928
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:30.530
that let thy folly in and thydear judgment out!

929
00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:32.870
Go, go, my people.

930
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:34.770
My lord, I am as guiltless as Iam ignorant

931
00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:36.170
of what hath moved you.

932
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:37.630
It may be so, my lord.

933
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:41.170
Hear, Nature, hear.

934
00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:43.730
Dear goddess, hear.

935
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:46.400
Suspend thy purpose if thoudidst intend

936
00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.700
to make this creature fruitful.

937
00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:52.900
Into her womb, convey sterility.

938
00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:56.230
Dry up in her the organs ofincrease.

939
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:59.670
And from her derogate body

940
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:01.900
never spring a babe to honorher.

941
00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:06.270
If she must teem, create herchild of spleen

942
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:07.370
that it may live

943
00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:09.770
and be a thwart disnaturedtorment to her.

944
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:11.470
Let it stamp wrinkles in herbrow of youth,

945
00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:13.800
with cadent tears fret channelsin her cheeks,

946
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.630
turn all her mother's pains andbenefits

947
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:18.700
to laughter and contempt

948
00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:23.570
that she may feel how sharperthan a serpent's tooth it is

949
00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:26.500
to have a thankless child.

950
00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:29.400
Away, away!

951
00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.800
Now, gods that we adore,wherefore comes this?

952
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.030
Never afflict yourself to knowmore of it,

953
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:36.630
but let his disposition havethat scope

954
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:38.330
as dotage gives it.

955
00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:42.330
What, fifty of my followers at aclap within a fortnight?

956
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:43.500
What's the matter, sir?

957
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.670
I'll tell thee: life and death!

958
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:47.000
I am ashamed that thou hastpower

959
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.830
to shake my manhood thus,

960
00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:51.230
that these hot tears, whichbreak from me perforce,

961
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:52.370
should make thee worth them.

962
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:54.970
Blasts and fogs upon thee!

963
00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:57.170
The untented woundings of afather's curse

964
00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:58.370
pierce every sense about thee.

965
00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:04.530
Old fond eyes, beweep this causeagain,

966
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:06.530
I'll pluck ye out and cast you,

967
00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:08.970
with the waters that you loose,to temper clay.

968
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.330
It is come to this?

969
00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:16.770
Let it be so.

970
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.330
I have another daughter,

971
00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:22.630
who, I am sure, is kind andcomfortable.

972
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:25.130
When she shall hear this ofthee,

973
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:30.630
with her nails, she'll flay thywolvish visage.

974
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:32.970
Thou shalt find that I'll resumethat shape

975
00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:35.670
which thou dost think I havecast off forever.

976
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:42.500
Do you mark that, my lord?

977
00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:47.170
I cannot be so partial, Goneril,to the great love I bear you

978
00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:48.700
Pray you, content.

979
00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.500
What, Oswald, ho!

980
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:54.670
You, sir, more knave than fool,after your master.

981
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:55.800
Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear,

982
00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.830
tarry, take the fool with thee!

983
00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:00.100
The fox, when one has caughther,

984
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.900
and such a daughter should sureto the slaughter

985
00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.470
if my cap would buy a halter!

986
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:07.700
And so the fool follows after!

987
00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.830
This man hath had good counsel:a hundred knights.

988
00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:13.730
'Tis politic and safe

989
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:15.430
to let him keep at point ahundred knightsÃ³

990
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:18.130
yes, that, on every dream, eachbuzz, each fancy,

991
00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:19.370
each complaint, dislike,

992
00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:21.270
he may enguard his dotage intheir powers

993
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:24.070
and hold our lives in mercy?

994
00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:25.270
Oswald, I say!

995
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:27.430
Well, you may fear too far.

996
00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.300
Safer than trust too far.

997
00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.100
Let me still take away the harmsI fear,

998
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:38.700
not fear still to be taken.

999
00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:42.830
I know his heart.

1000
00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:46.430
What he hath uttered I have writmy sister.

1001
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:48.730
If she sustain him and hishundred knights

1002
00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:51.030
when I have showed theunfitnessÃ³

1003
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:53.030
how now, Oswald?

1004
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.870
What, have you writ that letterto my sister?

1005
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:56.170
Aye, madam.

1006
00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:59.230
Take you some company, and awayto horse.

1007
00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:02.570
Inform her full of my particularfear.

1008
00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:05.330
And thereto add such reasons asyour own

1009
00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:07.030
as may compact it more.

1010
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:09.170
Get you gone, and hasten yourreturn.

1011
00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:14.300
No, no, my lord,

1012
00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.900
this milky gentleness and courseof yours,

1013
00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:18.600
though I condemn not, yet, underpardon,

1014
00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.400
you are much more attasked forwant of wisdom

1015
00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.400
than praised for harmfulmildness.

1016
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.930
How far your eyes may pierce, Icannot tell.

1017
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.900
Striving to be better, oft wemar what's well.

1018
00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.670
Nay, then.

1019
00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:39.100
Oh, well, the event.

1020
00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:58.830
Go you before to Gloucester withthese letters.

1021
00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:01.530
Acquaint my daughter no furtherwith anything you know

1022
00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:04.400
than comes from her demand outof the letter.

1023
00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.000
If your diligence be not speedy,I shall be there before you.

1024
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.300
I will not sleep, my lord, tillI have delivered your letter.

1025
00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:14.730
If a man's brains were in hisheels,

1026
00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:16.670
were't not in danger of kibes?

1027
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:18.430
Ay, boy.

1028
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:21.530
Then, I prithee, be merry; thywit shall not go slip-shod.

1029
00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:23.070
Ha, ha, ha.

1030
00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:26.500
Shalt see thy other daughterwill use thee kindly,

1031
00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.630
for though she's as like this asa crab's like an apple,

1032
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:30.970
yet I can tell what I can tell.

1033
00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:32.330
What canst tell, boy?

1034
00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:35.400
She will taste as like this as acrab does to a crab.

1035
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:36.830
Canst tell why one's nose stands

1036
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:37.870
in the middle on's face?

1037
00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:39.130
No.

1038
00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:40.830
To keep his eyes on either sideof his nose,

1039
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:42.400
that what a man cannot smellout,

1040
00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.030
he may spy into.

1041
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:45.330
I did her wrong.

1042
00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:46.930
Canst tell how an oyster makeshis shell?

1043
00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:48.030
No!

1044
00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:49.770
No, nor I neither!

1045
00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:51.800
But I can tell why a snail has ahouse.

1046
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.030
Why?

1047
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:54.230
To put his head in,

1048
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:55.670
not to give it away to hisdaughters

1049
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:58.070
and leave his horns without acase.

1050
00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:01.370
I shall forget my nature.

1051
00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:04.030
So kind a father.

1052
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:05.730
Be my horses ready?

1053
00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:08.070
Thy asses are gone about 'em.

1054
00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:13.570
The reason why the seven starsare no more than seven

1055
00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:14.770
is a pretty reason.

1056
00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:15.830
Because they're not eight?

1057
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:18.070
Yes, indeed.

1058
00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:20.230
Thou would make a good fool.

1059
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:21.770
To take 't again perforce.

1060
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:24.430
Monster ingratitude.

1061
00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:25.870
If thou wert my fool, nuncle,

1062
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:29.900
I'ld have thee beaten for beingold before thy time.

1063
00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:31.770
How's that?

1064
00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:42.230
Thou shouldst not have been oldtill thou hadst been wise.

1065
00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:48.000
O, let me not be mad, not mad.

1066
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.300
Sweet heaven, keep me in temper.

1067
00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:52.230
I would not be mad.

1068
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:54.370
How now! Are my horses ready?

1069
00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:55.370
Ready, my lord.

1070
00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:56.700
Come, boy.

1071
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
She that's a maid now and laughsat my departure

1072
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.130
shall not be a maid long unlessthings be cut shorter.

1073
00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:10.830
Save thee, Curan.

1074
00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:12.070
And you, sir.

1075
00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:15.870
Oh, I've been with your father

1076
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:17.670
and given him notice that theDuke of Cornwall

1077

and Regan, his duchess,

1078
00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:21.730
will be here with him thisnight.

1079
00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:22.970
How comes that?

1080
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:25.430
Nay, I know not.

1081
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:28.770
You have heard of the newsabroad.

1082
00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:30.470
Not I. Pray you, what are they?

1083
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:32.570
Have you heard of no likely warstoward

1084
00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:34.300
'twixt Dukes of Cornwall andAlbany?

1085
00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:35.630
Not a word.

1086
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:40.670
You may do, then, in time.

1087
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:42.930
Fare you well, sir.

1088
00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:53.230
The duke be here tonight?

1089
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:55.230
The better.

1090
00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:57.870
Best.

1091
00:52:57.870 --> 00:53:00.830
This weaves itself perforce intomy business.

1092
00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:03.500
My father hath set guard to takemy brother,

1093
00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:06.300
and I have one thing, of aqueasy question,

1094
00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.030
which I must act.

1095
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:12.300
Briefness and fortune, work.

1096
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:17.270
Brother, a word. Descend.

1097
00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:23.670
Brother, I say! Come.

1098
00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:26.070
My father watches.

1099
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.470
O sir, fly this place.

1100
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.170
Intelligence is given where youare hid.

1101
00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:31.500
You have now the good advantageof the night.

1102
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.000
Have you not spoken 'gainst theDuke of Cornwall?

1103
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
He's coming hither now, i' thenight, i' the haste,

1104
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.100
and Regan with him.

1105
00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:38.600
Have you nothing said upon hisparty

1106
00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:40.030
'gainst the Duke of Albany?

1107
00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:41.170
Advise yourself.

1108
00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:42.570
I am sure on't, not a word.

1109
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:45.500
I hear my father coming. Pardonme.

1110
00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:47.770
In cunning, I must draw my swordupon you.

1111
00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:49.800
Draw; seem to defend yourself.

1112
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:50.930
Now quit you well.

1113
00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:52.000
Ha! Yield!

1114
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.630
Come before my father!

1115
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:54.770
Light, ho, here!

1116
00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:55.800
Fly, brother.

1117
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.670
Torches, torches!

1118
00:53:57.670 --> 00:54:01.730
So farewell.

1119
00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:03.870
Some blood drawn on me wouldbeget opinion

1120
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:06.170
of my more fierce endeavor.

1121
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:10.970
I have seen drunkards do morethan this in sport.

1122
00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:15.570
Father, father!

1123
00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:17.730
Stop, stop!

1124
00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:18.830
What, no help?

1125
00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:20.230
Now, Edmund, where's thevillain?

1126
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:23.330
Here stood he in the dark, hissharp sword out,

1127
00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:24.730
mumbling of wicked charms,

1128
00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:26.970
conjuring the moon to standauspicious mistress.

1129
00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:28.000
But where is he?

1130
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.130
Look, sir, I bleed.

1131
00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:30.330
Where is the villain, Edmund?

1132
00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:31.370
Fled this way, sir.

1133
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:32.700
When by no means he couldÃ³

1134
00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:34.170
Pursue him, ho! Go after.

1135
00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:35.570
By no means what?

1136
00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:38.300
Persuade me to the murder ofYour Lordship.

1137
00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:40.770
O strong and fastened villain.

1138
00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:42.870
Would he deny his letter?

1139
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:44.600
I never got him.

1140
00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.870
Hark, the duke's trumpet.

1141
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:49.170
I know not why he comes.

1142
00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:50.200
All ports I'll bar.

1143
00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:51.800
The villain shall not 'scape.

1144
00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.500
The duke must grant me that.

1145
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:56.900
And of my land, loyal andnatural boy,

1146
00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.730
I'll work the means to make theecapable.

1147
00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:04.430
How now, my noble friend?

1148
00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:06.600
Since I came hither, which I cancall but now,

1149
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.270
I have heard strange news.

1150
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:09.970
If it be true, all vengeancecomes too short

1151
00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:11.570
which can pursue the offender.

1152
00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:13.770
How dost, my lord?

1153
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:15.870
O, madam, my old heart iscracked; it's cracked.

1154
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:18.730
What, did my father's godsonseek your life?

1155
00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:21.000
He whom my father named? YourEdgar?

1156
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.200
Lady, lady, shame would have ithid.

1157
00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.000
Was he not companion with theriotous knights

1158
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.270
that tend upon my father?

1159
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:28.970
I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad,too bad.

1160
00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:31.370
Yes, madam, he was of thatconsort.

1161
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:34.830
No marvel, then, though he wereill affected.

1162
00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:38.070
'Tis they have put him onto theold man's death

1163
00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:40.600
to have the expense and waste ofhis revenue.

1164
00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.470
I have this present evening frommy sister

1165
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:45.800
been well informed of them, andwith such cautions

1166
00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.600
that if they come to sojourn atmy house,

1167
00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:48.630
I'll not be there.

1168
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:50.430
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.

1169
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:52.730
Edmund, I hear that you haveshown your father

1170
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:54.330
a child-like office.

1171
00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:55.930
It was my duty, sir.

1172
00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:58.930
He did bewray his practice andreceived this hurt you see

1173
00:55:58.930 --> 00:56:00.070
striving to apprehend him.

1174
00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:01.100
Is he pursued?

1175
00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:02.100
Ay, my good lord.

1176
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:03.370
If he be taken,

1177
00:56:03.370 --> 00:56:05.070
he shall never more be feared ofdoing harm.

1178
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:08.430
Make your own purpose, how in mystrength you please.

1179
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:12.170
For you, Edmund, whose virtueand obedience

1180
00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:14.600
doth this instant so muchcommend itself,

1181
00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.470
you shall be ours.

1182
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:19.730
Natures of such deep trust shallwe much need.

1183
00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:21.670
You, we first seize on.

1184
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:25.230
I shall serve you, sir, truly,however else.

1185

For him, I thank Your Grace.

1186
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:29.100
You know not why we came tovisit you.

1187
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:32.330
Thus out of season, threadingdark-eyed night.

1188
00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:36.230
Occasions, noble Gloucester, ofsome poise,

1190

1192
00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:46.630
to answer from home.

1193
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:49.630
The several messengers fromhence attend dispatch.

1194

Ay.

Where may we set our horses?

1203
00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:40.900
I' the mire.

1204
00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:43.700
Prithee, if thou lov'st me, tellme.

1205
00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.030
I love thee not.

1206
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:47.730
Why, then, I care not for thee.

1207
00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:50.630
If I had thee in Lipsburypinfold,

1208
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:53.170
I'd make thee care for me.

1209
00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:54.700
Why dost thou use me thus?

1210
00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:55.900
I know thee not.

1211
00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:57.870
O fellow, I know thee.

1212
00:57:57.870 --> 00:57:59.970
What dost thou know me for?

1213
00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:07.030
A knave; a rascal; an eater ofbroken meats;

1214
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:12.300
a base, proud, shallow,beggarly, three-suited,

1215
00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:15.170
hundred-pound, filthy,worsted-stocking knave;

whoreson, glass-gazing,super-serviceable finical rogue;

1218
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:26.570
a one-trunk-inheriting slave;

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:29.170
one that wouldst be a bawd inway of good service

1220
00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:30.600
and art nothing but thecomposition

1221

and the son and heir of amongrel bitch;

1223
00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:39.100
and one whom I will beat intoclamorous whining

1224
00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:43.030
if thou deniest the leastsyllable of thy addition.

1225

Why, what a monstrous fellow artthou thus to rail upon one

What a brazen-faced varlet artthou

00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:54.130
to deny thou knowest me.

1229

Keep peace, upon your lives.

1254
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:41.300
He dies that strikes again.

1255
00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:43.130
What's the matter?

1256
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:45.070
The messengers from our sisterand the king.

1257
00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:47.430
What's your difference? Speak.

1258
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:49.100
I am scarce in breath, my lord.

1259
00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:50.900
No marvel, you have so bestirredyour valor.

1260
00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:53.530
You cowardly rascal, naturedisclaims in thee.

1261
00:59:53.530 --> 00:59:55.470
A tailor made thee.

1262
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:56.900
Thou art a strange fellow.

1263
00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:58.400
A tailor make a man?

1264
00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:59.800
Ay, a tailor, sir.

1265
00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:02.530
A stone-cutter or a paintercould not have made him so ill,

1266
01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:05.000
though he had been but two hoursat the trade.

1267
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.130
Speak yet. How grew yourquarrel?

1268
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:08.670
This ancient ruffian, sir,

1269
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:11.370
whose life I have spared at suitof his gray beardÃ³

1270
01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:12.600
Thou whoreson zed!

1271
01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.970
Thou unnecessary letter!

1272
01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:16.570
My lord, if you'll give meleave,

1273
01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:18.500
I'll tread this unbolted villaininto mortar

1274
01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.370
and daub the wall of a jakeswith him.

1275
01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:21.800
Peace, sirrah!

1276
01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.030
You beastly knave, know you noreverence?

1277
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:26.530
Yes, sir, but anger hath aprivilege.

1278
01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:27.800
Why art thou angry?

1279
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.970
That such a slave as this shouldwear a sword

1280
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:33.770
who wears no honesty.

1281
01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:38.230
Such smiling rogues as theserenege, affirm,

1282
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:39.500
and turn their halcyon beaks

1283
01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.800
with every gale and vary oftheir master,

1284
01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:44.030
knowing naught, like dogs, butfollowing.

1285
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:47.500
A plague upon your epilepticvisage!

1286
01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.030
Smile you my speeches as I werea fool?

1287
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:52.470
Goose, if I had you upon Sarumplain,

1288
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:54.530
I'ld drive ye cackling home toCamelot.

1289
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:56.170
Why, art thou mad, old fellow?

1290
01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:57.800
How fell you out? Say that.

1291
01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.500
No contraries hold moreantipathy

1292
01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.200
than I and such a knave.

1293
01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.800
Why dost thou call him knave?

1294
01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.030
What is his fault?

1295
01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.430
His countenance likes me not.

1296
01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:11.670
No more, perchance, does mine,nor his, nor hers.

1297
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:13.730
Sir, 'tis my occupation to beplain.

1298
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:15.070
I have seen better faces in mytime

1299
01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:16.900
than stands on any shoulder thatI see before me

1300
01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:18.670
at this instant.

1301
01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.670
This is some fellow who,

1302
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:24.100
having been praised forbluntness,

1303
01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.370
doth affect a saucy roughness

1304
01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:29.400
and constrains the garb quitefrom his nature.

1305
01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.070
He cannot flatter, he.

1306
01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:34.630
An honest mind and plain, hemust speak truth.

1307
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:38.570
An' they will take it, so; ifnot, he's plain.

1308
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:41.870
These kind of knaves I know,which in this plainness

1309
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:44.470
harbor more craft and morecorrupter ends

1310
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:46.430
than 20 silly ducking observants

1311
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:48.270
that stretch their dutiesnicely.

1312
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:51.270
Oh, sir, in good faith, insincere verity,

1313
01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:52.930
under the allowance of yourgreat aspect,

1314
01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:54.430
whose influence,

1315
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:57.030
like the wreath of radiant fireon flickering Phoebus' frontÃ³

1316
01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:58.370
What mean'st by this?

1317
01:01:58.370 --> 01:02:02.130
To go out of my dialect, whichyou discommend so much.

1318
01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:04.170
I know, sir, I am no flatterer.

1319
01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:05.630
He that beguiled you in a plainaccent

1320
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:09.230
was a plain knave, which, for mypart, I will not be,

1321
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:10.700
though I should win yourdispleasure

1322
01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:11.970
to entreat me to it.

1323
01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:14.130
What was the offense you gavehim?

1324
01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:15.570
I never gave him any.

1325
01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:19.070
It pleased the king, his master,very late to strike at me,

1326
01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:21.170
upon his misconstruction, whenhe,

1327
01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:23.730
compact and flattering hisdispleasure,

1328
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:26.800
tripped me behind being down,insulted, railed,

1329
01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.800
and put upon him such a deal ofman

1330
01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.930
as worthied him, got praises ofthe king

1331
01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:33.500
for him attempting who wasself-subdued,

1332
01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.970
and, in the fleshment of thisdread exploit,

1333
01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:37.830
drew on me here again.

1334
01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:41.570
None of these rogues and cowardsbut Ajax is their fool.

1335
01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:43.570
Fetch forth the stocks.

1336
01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:47.700
You stubborn ancient knave, youreverend braggart,

1337
01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:48.970
we'll teach you.

1338
01:02:48.970 --> 01:02:50.800
Sir, I'm too old to learn.

1339
01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.070
Call not your stocks for me.

1340
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:54.770
I serve the king,

1341
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:57.300
on whose employment I was sentto you.

1342
01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.700
You shall do small respect, showtoo bold malice

1343
01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:02.370
against the grace and person ofmy master,

1344
01:03:02.370 --> 01:03:04.330
stocking his messenger.

1345
01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:05.930
Fetch forth the stocks.

1346
01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:09.670
As I have life and honor, thereshall he sit till noon.

1347
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:10.770
Till noon?

1348
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:19.200
Till night, my lord, and allnight too.

1349
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.570
Why, madam, if I were yourfather's dog,

1350
01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:23.430
you should not use me so.

1351
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:25.200
Sir, being his knave, I will.

1352
01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.730
This is a fellow of theself-same color

1353
01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:28.370
our sister speaks of.

1354
01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:29.970
Come, bring away the stocks.

1355
01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:32.300
Let me beseech Your Grace not todo so.

1356
01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.470
His fault is much, and the goodking his master

1357
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:35.600
will check him for 't.

1358
01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.700
Your purposed low correction

1359
01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:39.830
is such as basest andcontemned'st wretches

1360
01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:42.470
for pilferings and most commontrespasses

1361
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:43.670
are punished with.

1362
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:44.900
The king must take it ill

1363
01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:47.200
that he's so slightly valued inhis messenger

1364
01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.600
should have him thus restrained.

1365
01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.030
I'll answer that.

1366
01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:51.770
My sister may receive it muchmore worse

1367
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:53.370
to have her gentleman abused,assaulted,

1368
01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:56.330
for following her affairs.

1369
01:03:56.330 --> 01:03:58.400
Put in his legs.

1370
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:05.830
Come, my good lord, away.

1371
01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:14.970
I am sorry for thee, friend.

1372
01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:17.900
'Tis the duke's pleasure, whosedisposition,

1373
01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:20.830
all the world well knows, willnot be rubbed nor stopped.

1374
01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:22.900
I'll entreat for thee.

1375
01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:24.000
Pray, do not, sir.

1376
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.600
I have watched and traveledhard.

1377
01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.670
Some time I shall sleep out; therest, I'll whistle.

1378
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:33.070
A good man's fortune may growout at heels.

1379
01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:35.330
Give you good morrow.

1380
01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:40.270
The duke's to blame in this;'twill be ill taken.

1381
01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:55.700
Good king, that must approve thecommon saw,

1382
01:04:55.700 --> 01:05:02.470
thou out of heaven's benedictioncomest to the warm sun.

1383
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:07.070
Approach, thou beacon to thisunder globe,

1384
01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:11.670
that by thy comfortable beams Imay peruse this letter.

1385
01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.770
Nothing almost sees miracles butmisery.

1386
01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:19.130
I know 'tis from Cordelia,

1387
01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:20.730
who hath most fortunately beeninformed

1388
01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:24.830
of my obscured course...

1389
01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:31.400
and shall find time from thisenormous state,

1390
01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.430
seeking to give losses theirremedies.

1391
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:49.200
All weary and o'erwatched, takevantage, heavy eyes,

1392
01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.000
not to behold this shamefullodging.

1393
01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:58.830
Fortune, good night.

1394
01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:01.230
Smile once more.

1395
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:04.130
Turn thy wheel.

1396
01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:16.070
I heard myself proclaimed

1397
01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:19.700
and, by the happy hollow of atree, escaped the hunt.

1398
01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:22.300
No port is free,

1399
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:25.030
no place that guard and mostunusual vigilance

1400
01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:26.770
does not attend my taking.

1401
01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:30.470
Whiles I may 'scape, I willpreserve myself

1402
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:32.730
and am bethought to take

1403
01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:34.670
the basest and most poorestshape

1404
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:36.470
that ever penury, in contempt ofman,

1405
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:39.300
brought near to beast.

1406
01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:41.530
My face, I'll grime with filth,

1407
01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:45.100
blanket my loins: elf all myhairs in knots,

1408
01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:46.930
and, with presented nakedness,

1409
01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:50.270
out-face the winds andpersecutions of the sky.

1410
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:53.770
The country gives me proof andprecedent of Bedlam beggars,

1411
01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:55.830
who, with roaring voices,

1412
01:06:55.830 --> 01:07:00.070
strike in their numbed andmortified bare arms

1413
01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:04.400
pins, wooden pricks, nails,sprigs of rosemary

1414
01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:08.670
and, with this horrible object,from low farms,

1415
01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:13.030
poor pelting villages,sheep-cotes, and mills,

1416
01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:16.930
sometime with lunatic bans,sometime with prayers,

1417
01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:19.130
enforce their charity.

1418
01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:23.230
Poor Turlygod.

1419
01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.170
Poor Tom.

1420
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:32.370
That's something yet.

1421
01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:36.900
Edgar, I nothing am.

1422
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:41.130
'Tis strange that they should sodepart from home

1423
01:07:41.130 --> 01:07:42.470
and not send back my messenger.

1424
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:44.270
As I learned, the night before,

1425
01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:45.970
there was no purpose in them ofthis remove.

1426
01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:48.330
Hail to thee, noble master.

1427
01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:50.070
Ah!

1428
01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:53.070
Mak'st thou this shame thypastime?

1429
01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:54.600
No, my lord.

1430
01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:57.100
He wears cruel garters.

1431
01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.570
Horses are tied by the head,dogs and bears by the neck,

1432
01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:03.270
monkeys by the loins, and men bythe legs.

1433
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:07.000
When a man's over-lusty at legs,he wears wooden nether-stocks.

1434
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.770
What's he that has so much thyplace mistook

1435
01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:09.970
to set thee here?

1436
01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:11.700
It is both he and she; your sonand daughter.

1437
01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:13.330
- No. - Yes.

1438
01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:14.670
- No, I say. - I say yea.

1439
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:16.530
No, no, they would not.

1440
01:08:16.530 --> 01:08:17.600
Yes, they have.

1441
01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:18.930
By Jupiter, I swear, no.

1442
01:08:18.930 --> 01:08:20.930
By Juno, I swear, aye.

1443
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.270
They durst not do it.

1444
01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:25.870
They could not, would not do it.

1445
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:27.130
'Tis worse than murder,

1446
01:08:27.130 --> 01:08:29.970
to do upon respect such violentoutrage.

1447
01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:32.700
Resolve me, with all modesthaste,

1448
01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:35.170
which way thou mightst deserve

1449
01:08:35.170 --> 01:08:38.630
or they employ this usage,coming from us.

1450
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:39.930
My lord, when at their home,

1451
01:08:39.930 --> 01:08:42.030
I did commend your highness'letters to them.

1452
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:44.730
'Ere I was risen from the placethat showed my duty kneeling,

1453
01:08:44.730 --> 01:08:47.330
came there a reeking post,stewed in his haste,

1454
01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:48.730
half breathless,

1455
01:08:48.730 --> 01:08:52.130
panting forth from Goneril, hismistress, salutations;

1456
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:53.900
delivered letters, spite ofintermission,

1457
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:55.900
which presently they read;

1458
01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:58.000
on whose contents, they summonedup their meiny,

1459
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.270
straight took horse, commandedme to follow,

1460
01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:02.470
and attend the leisure of theiranswer,

1461
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:04.370
gave me cold looks.

1462
01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:05.900
And meeting here the othermessenger,

1463
01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:09.370
whose welcome, I perceived, hadpoisoned mineÃ³

1464
01:09:09.370 --> 01:09:11.170
being the very fellow which oflate displayed

1465
01:09:11.170 --> 01:09:13.570
so saucily against yourhighnessÃ³

1466
01:09:13.570 --> 01:09:16.500
having more man than wit aboutme, drew.

1467
01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.630
He raised the house with loudand coward cries.

1468
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:21.570
Your son and daughter found thistrespass

1469
01:09:21.570 --> 01:09:23.970
worth the shame which here itsuffers.

1470
01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:28.830
Winter's not gone yet if thewild geese fly that way.

1471
01:09:28.830 --> 01:09:33.630
Fathers that wear rags do maketheir children blind,

1472
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:37.730
but fathers that bear bags shallsee their children kind.

1473
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:39.770
Fortune, that arrant whore,

1474
01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:43.000
ne'er turns the key for thepoor.

1475
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.630
But, for all this,

1476
01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:49.330
thou shalt have as many dolorsfor thy daughters

1477
01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:52.200
as thou canst tell in a year.

1478
01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:56.330
O, how this mother swells uptoward my heart.

1479
01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:59.730
Hysterica passio, down.

1480
01:09:59.730 --> 01:10:02.070
Thou climbing sorrow, thyelement's below.

1481
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:04.500
Where is this daughter?

1482
01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.270
With the earl, sir, here within.

1483
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:11.230
Follow me not. Stay here.

1484
01:10:11.230 --> 01:10:14.030
Made you no more offense butwhat you speak of?

1485
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:16.100
None.

1486
01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:20.170
How chance the king comes withso small a number?

1487
01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:23.330
And thou hadst been set i' thestocks for that question,

1488
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:25.030
thou hadst well deserved it.

1489
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:26.300
Why, fool?

1490
01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:30.100
We'll set thee to school to anant

1491
01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:34.670
to teach thee there's nolaboring in the winter.

1492
01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:38.830
All that follow their noses areled by their eyes

1493
01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:40.770
but blind men.

1494
01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:41.970
And there's not a nose among 20

1495
01:10:41.970 --> 01:10:44.470
but can tell him that'sstinking.

1496
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:46.730
Let go thy hold

1497
01:10:46.730 --> 01:10:48.730
when a great wheel runs down ahill,

1498
01:10:48.730 --> 01:10:50.570
lest it break thy neck withfollowing.

1499
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:52.730
But the great one that goesupwards,

1500
01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:55.500
let him draw thee after.

1501
01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:58.200
When a wise man gives theebetter counsel,

1502
01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.170
give me mine again.

1503
01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:02.130
I'd have none but knaves followit,

1504
01:11:02.130 --> 01:11:04.330
since a fool gives it.

1505
01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:05.730
Where learned you this, fool?

1506
01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:10.700
Not i' the stocks, fool.

1507
01:11:12.970 --> 01:11:15.100
Deny to speak with me?

1508
01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:16.870
They are sick? They are weary?

1509
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:18.270
They have traveled all thenight?

1510
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:21.000
Mere fetches, the images ofrevolt and flying off.

1511
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.930
Fetch me a better answer.

1512
01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:26.800
My dear lord, you know the fieryquality of the duke,

1513
01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.330
how unremovable and fixed he isin his own course.

1514
01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:30.930
Vengeance, plague, death,confusion.

1515
01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:32.470
Fiery? What quality?

1516
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:34.200
Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,

1517
01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:37.330
I would speak with the Duke ofCornwall and his wife.

1518
01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:39.900
Well, my good lord, I haveinformed them so.

1519
01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:41.370
Informed them?

1520
01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:42.830
Dost understand me, man?

1521
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:43.900
Aye, my good lord.

1522
01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:46.170
The king would speak withCornwall.

1523
01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:48.970
The dear father would with hisdaughter speak,

1524
01:11:48.970 --> 01:11:50.730
commands their service.

1525
01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:52.970
Are they informed of this?

1526
01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:55.400
My breath and blood.

1527
01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.500
Fiery? The fiery duke?

1528
01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:00.530
Tell the hot duke thatÃ³

1529
01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:04.000
no, but not yet.

1530
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.330
Maybe he is not well.

1531
01:12:07.330 --> 01:12:09.500
Infirmity doth still neglect alloffice

1532
01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.430
to which our health is bound.

1533
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:13.630
We are not ourselves whennature, being oppressed,

1534
01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:15.330
commands the mind to suffer withthe body.

1535
01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:19.370
I'll forbear and am fallen outwith my more headier will

1536
01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:21.530
to take the indisposed andsickly fit

1537
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:22.830
for the sound man.

1538
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:24.870
Death on my state!

1539
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:26.600
Wherefore should he sit here?

1540
01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.100
This act persuades me

1541
01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:31.700
that this remotion of the dukeand her is practice only.

1542
01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:34.700
Give me my servant forth!

1543
01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:38.400
Go tell the duke and 's wifeI'ld speak with them

1544
01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.070
now, presently.

1545
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:43.830
Bid them come forth and hear me,or at their chamber-door,

1546
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:48.500
I'll beat the drum till it crysleep to death.

1547
01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:51.330
I would have all well betwixtyou.

1548
01:12:55.570 --> 01:13:02.330
O me, my heart, my rising heart.

1549
01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:04.170
But down.

1550
01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:07.570
Cry to it, nuncle, as thecockney did to the eels

1551
01:13:07.570 --> 01:13:10.000
when she put 'em in the pastealive.

1552
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.700
She knapped 'em o' the coxcombswith a stick

1553
01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.570
and cried, "Down, wantons,down!"

1554
01:13:13.570 --> 01:13:17.470
It was her brother that, in purekindness to his horse,

1555
01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:19.370
buttered his hay.

1556
01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:30.770
Good morrow to you both.

1557
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:32.030
Hail to Your Grace.

1558
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:33.870
I am glad to see Your Highness.

1559
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:41.970
Regan, I think you are.

1560
01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:45.200
I know what reason I have tothink so.

1561
01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.870
If thou shouldst not be glad,

1562
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:49.530
I would divorce me from thymother's tomb,

1563
01:13:49.530 --> 01:13:51.700
sepulchering an adulteress.

1564
01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:53.030
O, are you free?

1565
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:54.830
Some other time for that.

1566
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:59.330
Beloved Regan, thy sister'snaught.

1567
01:13:59.330 --> 01:14:03.930
O Regan, she hath tiedsharp-toothed unkindness,

1568
01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:05.930
like a vulture, here.

1569
01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:07.330
I can scarce speak to thee.

1570
01:14:07.330 --> 01:14:10.670
Thou'dst not believe with howdepraved a quality

1571
01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:13.670
O Regan.

1572
01:14:13.670 --> 01:14:15.870
I pray you, sir, take patience.

1573
01:14:15.870 --> 01:14:18.500
I have hope you less know how tovalue her desert

1574
01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.670
than she to scant her duty.

1575
01:14:20.670 --> 01:14:22.500
Say, how is that?

1576
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.970
I cannot think my sister in theleast

1577
01:14:23.970 --> 01:14:25.970
would fail in her obligation.

1578
01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:27.600
If, sir, perchance she haverestrained

1579
01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.400
the riots of your followers,

1580
01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.000
'tis on such ground and to suchwholesome end

1581
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.500
that clears her from all blame.

1582
01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:34.970
My curses on her.

1583
01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:37.000
O, sir, you are old.

1584
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.300
Nature in you stands on the veryverge of her confine.

1585
01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:43.570
You should be ruled and led bysome discretion

1586
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:47.430
that discerns your state betterthan you yourself.

1587
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:49.500
Therefore, I pray you,

1588
01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:52.000
that to my sister you do makereturn.

1589
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.530
Say you have wronged her, sir.

1590
01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:57.130
Ask her forgiveness?

1591
01:14:57.130 --> 01:14:59.330
Do you but mark how this becomesthe house?

1592
01:14:59.330 --> 01:15:03.400
"Dear daughter, I confess that Iam old.

1593
01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.130
"Age is unnecessary.

1594
01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:06.700
"On my knees, I beg

1595
01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:09.230
that you'll vouchsafe meraiment, bed, and food."

1596
01:15:09.230 --> 01:15:11.170
Good sir, no more of theseunsightly tricks.

1597
01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:12.300
Return you to my sister.

1598
01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.470
Never, Regan.

1599
01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:16.000
She hath abated me of half mytrain;

1600
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.100
looked black upon me; struck mewith her tongue,

1601
01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.630
most serpent-like, about thevery heart.

1602
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:22.630
All the stored vengeances ofheaven fall

1603
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:24.230
on her ingrateful top.

1604
01:15:24.230 --> 01:15:26.930
Strike her young bones, youtaking airs, with lameness.

1605
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:28.000
Fie, sir, fie.

1606
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.270
You nimble lightnings,

1607
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:31.970
dart your blinding flames intoher scornful eyes.

1608
01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:34.200
Infect her beauty, youfen-sucked fogs,

1609
01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.330
drawn by the powerful sun, tofall and blast her pride.

1610
01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:39.630
O the blest gods!

1611
01:15:39.630 --> 01:15:41.600
So will you wish on me when therash mood is on.

1612
01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.030
Never, Regan.

1613
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:45.130
Thou shalt never have my curse.

1614
01:15:45.130 --> 01:15:48.200
Thy tender-hefted nature shallnot give thee o'er

1615
01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:49.830
to harshness.

1616
01:15:49.830 --> 01:15:57.830
Her eyes are fierce, but thinedo comfort and not burn.

1617
01:15:57.830 --> 01:16:01.270
'Tis not in thee to grudge mypleasures,

1618
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:03.670
to cut off my train, to bandyhasty words,

1619
01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:06.500
to scant my sizes, and, inconclusion,

1620
01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.930
to oppose the bolt against mycoming in.

1621
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:13.000
Thou better knowest the officesof nature,

1622
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.170
bond of childhood, effects ofcourtesy,

1623
01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:18.100
dues of gratitude.

1624
01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:20.000
Thy half o' the kingdom hastthou not forgot,

1625
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.630
wherein I thee endowed.

1626
01:16:21.630 --> 01:16:23.500
Good sir, to the purpose.

1627
01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:26.800
Who put my man in the stocks?

1628
01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:28.930
What trumpet's that?

1629
01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:30.730
I know it; 'tis my sister's.

1630
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:33.670
This approves her letter; shewould soon be here.

1631
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:38.100
Is your lady come?

1632
01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:40.500
This is a slave whoseeasy-borrowed pride dwells

1633
01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.930
in the fickle grace of her hefollows.

1634
01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:44.830
Out, varlet, from my sight!

1635
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:46.930
What means Your Grace?

1636
01:16:46.930 --> 01:16:49.670
How came my man i' the stocks?

1637
01:16:49.670 --> 01:16:51.800
Regan, I have good hope thoudidst not know on't.

1638
01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.900
Who comes here?

1639
01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:01.670
O heavens, if you do love oldmen,

1640
01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:04.900
if your sweet sway allowobedience,

1641
01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:07.670
if you yourselves are old, makeit your cause.

1642
01:17:07.670 --> 01:17:09.930
Send down and take my part.

1643
01:17:09.930 --> 01:17:13.600
Art not ashamed to look uponthis beard?

1644
01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:16.330
O Regan, will you take her bythe hand?

1645
01:17:16.330 --> 01:17:17.670
Why not by the hand, sir?

1646
01:17:17.670 --> 01:17:19.370
How have I offended?

1647
01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:20.600
All's not offense

1648
01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:23.470
that indiscretion finds anddotage terms so.

1649
01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:27.530
O sides, you are too tough.

1650
01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:29.670
Will you yet hold?

1651
01:17:29.670 --> 01:17:33.830
How came my man i' the stocks?

1652
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:35.800
I set him there, sir.

1653
01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:38.870
But his own disorders deservedmuch less advancement.

1654
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:40.470
You.

1655
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:42.500
Did you?

1656
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:46.270
I pray you, father, being weak,seem so.

1657
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:48.370
If, till the expiration of amonth,

1658
01:17:48.370 --> 01:17:50.670
you will return and sojourn withmy sister,

1659
01:17:50.670 --> 01:17:54.700
dismissing half your train, comethen to me.

1660
01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:57.170
I am now from home and out ofthat provision

1661
01:17:57.170 --> 01:17:59.470
which shall be needful for yourentertainment.

1662
01:17:59.470 --> 01:18:02.270
Return to her and 50 mendismissed?

1663
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:06.000
No, rather I abjure all roofs

1664
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.830
and choose to wage against theenmity of the air,

1665
01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:11.030
To be a comrade with the wolfand owl.

1666
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:12.870
Necessity's sharp pinch.

1667
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:14.300
Return with her?

1668
01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.630
Why, the hot-blooded France,

1669
01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:18.430
who dowerless took our youngestborn,

1670
01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:21.170
I could as well be brought toknee his throne

1671
01:18:21.170 --> 01:18:25.400
and, squire-like, pension beg tokeep base life afoot.

1672
01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.830
Return with her?

1673
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:28.930
Persuade me rather to be slaveand sumpter

1674
01:18:28.930 --> 01:18:30.430
to that detested groom.

1675
01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:32.430
At your choice, sir.

1676
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:35.000
I prithee, daughter, do not makeme mad!

1677
01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:39.900
I'll no more trouble thee, mychild.

1678
01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:42.470
Farewell, we'll no more meet, nomore see one another.

1679
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:48.700
And yet thou art my flesh, myblood, my daughter.

1680
01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:51.500
Or rather a disease that's in myflesh

1681
01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.970
which I must needs call mine.

1682
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:54.630
Thou art a boil, a plague-sore,

1683
01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:58.000
an embossed carbuncle in mycorrupted blood.

1684
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.200
But I'll not chide thee.

1685
01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:03.600
Let shame come when it will; Ido not call it.

1686
01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.200
I do not bid the thunder-bearershoot

1687
01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.700
nor tell tales of thee tohigh-judging Jove.

1688
01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:09.970
Mend when thou canst; be betterat thy leisure.

1689
01:19:09.970 --> 01:19:11.800
I can be patient.

1690
01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:15.830
I can stay with Regan, I and myhundred knights.

1691
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:17.570
Not altogether so.

1692
01:19:17.570 --> 01:19:18.730
I looked not for you yet,

1693
01:19:18.730 --> 01:19:20.970
nor am provided for your fitwelcome.

1694
01:19:20.970 --> 01:19:23.730
Give ear, sir, to my sister,

1695
01:19:23.730 --> 01:19:26.570
for those that mingle reasonwith your passion

1696
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:31.170
must be content to think youold, and soÃ³

1697
01:19:31.170 --> 01:19:33.700
but she knows what she does.

1698
01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.770
Is this well spoken?

1699
01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:37.170
I dare avouch it, sir.

1700
01:19:37.170 --> 01:19:38.200
What, 50 followers?

1701
01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:39.400
Is it not well?

1702
01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.370
What should you need of more?

1703
01:19:41.370 --> 01:19:44.500
Yea, or so many, sith that bothcharge and danger

1704
01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:45.800
speak 'gainst so great a number?

1705
01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:48.900
How, in one house, should manypeople,

1706
01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:51.130
under two commands, hold amity?

1707
01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:55.830
'Tis hard, almost impossible.

1708
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:58.170
Why might not you, my lord,receive attendance

1709
01:19:58.170 --> 01:20:01.630
from those that she callsservants or from mine?

1710
01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.970
Why not, my lord?

1711
01:20:03.970 --> 01:20:05.570
If then they chanced to slackye,

1712
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:07.370
we could control them.

1713
01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:12.530
If you will come to me for now Ispy a danger

1714
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:15.830
I do entreat you bring but fiveand twenty.

1715
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:19.300
To no more will I give place ornotice.

1716
01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:22.700
I gave you all.

1717
01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:25.000
And in good time, you gave it.

1718
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.930
Made you my guardians, mydepositaries,

1719
01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:28.600
But kept a reservation to befollowed

1720
01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.230
by such a number.

1721
01:20:30.230 --> 01:20:33.570
What, must I come to you withfive and twenty, Regan?

1722
01:20:33.570 --> 01:20:34.670
Said you so?

1723
01:20:34.670 --> 01:20:37.030
And speak't again, my lord.

1724
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:38.670
No more with me.

1725
01:20:41.630 --> 01:20:45.000
Those wicked creatures yet dolook more favored

1726
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.500
when others are more wicked.

1727
01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.430
Not being worst stands in somerank of praise.

1728
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:50.530
I'll go with thee.

1729
01:20:50.530 --> 01:20:53.970
Thy fifty yet doth double fiveand twenty,

1730
01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:56.030
and thou art twice her love.

1731
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:57.270
Hear me, my lord.

1732
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:59.000
What need you five and twenty,ten, or five,

1733
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.600
to follow in a house where twiceso many

1734
01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.370
have a command to tend you?

1735
01:21:02.370 --> 01:21:04.430
What need one?

1736
01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:10.600
O, reason not the need.

1737
01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:15.730
Our basest beggars are in thepoorest thing superfluous.

1738
01:21:15.730 --> 01:21:18.600
Allow not nature more thannature needs,

1739
01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.400
man's life is cheap as beast's.

1740
01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.030
Thou art a lady.

1741
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:24.830
If only to go warm weregorgeous,

1742
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:27.730
why, nature needs not what thougorgeous wear'st,

1743
01:21:27.730 --> 01:21:29.830
which scarcely keeps thee warm.

1744
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:32.000
But for true need

1745
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.900
heavens, give me that patience.

1746
01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:36.170
Patience, I need!

1747
01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:39.470
You see me here, you gods,

1748
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:42.470
a poor old man as full of griefas age,

1749
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:43.770
wretched in both.

1750
01:21:43.770 --> 01:21:46.570
If it be you that stirs thesedaughters' hearts

1751
01:21:46.570 --> 01:21:48.400
against their father,

1752
01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:52.370
fool me not so much to bear ittamely.

1753
01:21:52.370 --> 01:21:56.830
Touch me with noble anger, andlet not women's weapons,

1754
01:21:56.830 --> 01:22:00.430
water-drops, stain my man'scheeks.

1755
01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:02.970
No, you unnatural hags,

1756
01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:06.070
I will have such revenges on youboth

1757
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:08.830
as all the world shall

1758
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:12.200
I shall do such things

1759
01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:14.030
What they are, yet I know not,

1760
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:16.970
but they shall be the terrors ofthe Earth.

1761
01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:18.730
You think I'll weep.

1762
01:22:18.730 --> 01:22:21.170
No, I'll not weep.

1763
01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:27.270
I have full cause for weeping,but this heart shall break

1764
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:31.300
into a hundred thousand flaws orere I'll weep.

1765
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:38.830
O fool, I shall go mad.

1766
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.800
Let us withdraw.

1767
01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:57.800
'Twill be a storm.

1768
01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:00.600
This house is little.

1769
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:04.200
The old man and his peoplecannot be well bestowed.

1770
01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.370
'Tis his own blame hath puthimself from rest

1771
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:08.800
and must needs taste his folly.

1772
01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:12.200
For his particular, I'll receivehim gladly

1773
01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:14.830
but not one follower.

1774
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:16.700
So am I purposed.

1775
01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:19.230
Where is my Lord of Gloucester?

1776
01:23:19.230 --> 01:23:21.200
Followed the old man forth.

1777
01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:23.200
He is returned.

1778
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.070
The king is in high rage.

1779
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:26.400
Whither is he going?

1780
01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:29.070
He calls to horse, but will Iknow not whither.

1781
01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:31.830
'Tis best to give him way; heleads himself.

1782
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:32.830
Hear me, my lord.

1783
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:35.430
Entreat him by no means to stay.

1784
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:37.070
Alas, the night comes on,

1785
01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:39.330
and the high winds do sorelyruffle.

1786
01:23:39.330 --> 01:23:41.430
For many miles about, there'sscarce a bush.

1787
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:43.100
O, sir, to willful men,

1788
01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:45.030
the injuries that theythemselves procure

1789
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:47.330
must be their schoolmasters!

1790
01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:49.730
Shut up your doors.

1791
01:23:49.730 --> 01:23:52.870
He's tended by a desperatetrain,

1792
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:56.800
and what they may incense himto,

1793
01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:59.130
being apt to have his earabused,

1794
01:23:59.130 --> 01:24:00.630
wisdom bids fear.

1795
01:24:00.630 --> 01:24:04.170
Shut up your doors, my lord;'tis a wild night.

1796
01:24:04.170 --> 01:24:06.470
My Regan counsels well.

1797
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:10.070
Come, out of the storm.

1798
01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:26.000
Who's there, besides foulweather?

1799
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.730
One minded like the weather:most unquietly.

1800
01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:29.870
Where's the king?

1801
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:32.530
Contending with the fretfulelements.

1802
01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:34.200
Bids the winds blow the Earthinto the sea

1803
01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:36.730
or swell the curled waters 'bovethe main,

1804
01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:38.300
that things might change orcease.

1805
01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:39.800
Sir, I do know you and dare,

1806
01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.230
upon the warrant of my note,commend a dear thing to you.

1807
01:24:42.230 --> 01:24:43.830
There is division, although asyet,

1808
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:45.630
the face of it is covered withmutual cunning,

1809
01:24:45.630 --> 01:24:46.970
'twixt Albany and Cornwall.

1810
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:48.870
But, true it is, from France,there comes a power

1811
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:50.030
into this scattered kingdom

1812
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:51.530
who already, wise in ournegligence,

1813
01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:53.300
have secret feet in some of ourbest ports

1814
01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:55.470
and are at point to show theiropen banner.

1815
01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:56.600
Now, sir, to you.

1816
01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:58.500
If, on my credit, you dare buildso far

1817
01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.470
to make your speed to Dover,

1818
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:02.230
you shall find some that willthank you,

1819
01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:03.330
making just report

1820
01:25:03.330 --> 01:25:04.930
of how unnatural and bemaddingsorrow

1821
01:25:04.930 --> 01:25:06.730
the king hath cause to plain.

1822
01:25:06.730 --> 01:25:08.200
I am a gentleman of blood andbreeding

1823
01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.800
and, from some knowledge andassurance,

1824
01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:11.000
offer this office to you.

1825
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.100
I will talk further with you.

1826
01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:13.670
No, do not.

1827
01:25:13.670 --> 01:25:16.600
For confirmation that I am muchmore than my out-wall,

1828
01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.130
open this purse, and take whatit contains.

1829
01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:22.100
If you should see Cordelia asfear not but you shall

1830
01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:24.330
show her this ring, and she willtell you

1831
01:25:24.330 --> 01:25:26.470
who that fellow is that yet youdo not know.

1832
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:27.830
Fie on this storm.

1833
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:30.430
I'll go seek the king.

1834
01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:33.830
Blow, winds, and crack yourcheeks!

1835
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:35.470
Rage!

1836
01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:38.170
Blow!

1837
01:25:38.170 --> 01:25:43.770
You cataracts and hurricanoes,spout till you have drenched

1838
01:25:43.770 --> 01:25:47.430
our steeples, drowned the cocks!

1839
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:51.370
You sulfurous andthought-executing fires,

1840
01:25:51.370 --> 01:25:54.170
vaunt-couriers of oak-cleavingthunderbolts,

1841
01:25:54.170 --> 01:25:58.200
singe my white head!

1842
01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:01.200
And you, all-shaking thunder,

1843
01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:05.670
strike flat the thick rotundityo' the world!

1844
01:26:05.670 --> 01:26:12.330
Crack nature's molds, allgermens spill at once

1845
01:26:12.330 --> 01:26:14.130
that make ingrateful man!

1846
01:26:14.130 --> 01:26:17.730
Nuncle, court holy-water in adry house

1847
01:26:17.730 --> 01:26:19.500
is better than this rain-waterout o' door.

1848
01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:20.570
Good nuncle, in.

1849
01:26:20.570 --> 01:26:22.970
Ask thy daughters' blessing.

1850
01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:26.800
Here's a night pities neitherwise men nor fools.

1851
01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:30.070
Rumble thy bellyful!

1852
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:34.970
Spit, fire! Spout, rain!

1853
01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:39.130
Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire,are my daughters.

1854
01:26:39.130 --> 01:26:41.630
I tax not you, you elements,with unkindness.

1855
01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:44.670
I never gave you kingdom, calledyou children.

1856
01:26:44.670 --> 01:26:46.730
You owe me no subscription.

1857
01:26:46.730 --> 01:26:51.570
Then let fall your horriblepleasure.

1858
01:26:51.570 --> 01:26:56.870
Here I stand, your slave;

1859
01:26:56.870 --> 01:27:01.570
a poor, infirm, weak, anddespised old man.

1860
01:27:01.570 --> 01:27:07.730
And yet I call you servileministers

1861
01:27:07.730 --> 01:27:10.270
that will with two perniciousdaughters

1862
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:12.170
join your high engenderedbattles

1863
01:27:12.170 --> 01:27:16.670
'gainst a head so old and whiteas this.

1864
01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:18.500
Oh.

1865
01:27:20.370 --> 01:27:21.800
'Tis foul.

1866
01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.800
He that has a house to put hishead in

1867
01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.930
has a good head-piece.

1868
01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:27.870
No.

1869
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:33.070
I will be the pattern of allpatience.

1870
01:27:33.070 --> 01:27:35.700
I will say nothing.

1871
01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:38.800
Who's there?

1872
01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.830
Marry, here's grace and acod-piece.

1873
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:43.570
That's a wise man and a fool.

1874
01:27:43.570 --> 01:27:45.600
Alas, sir, are you here?

1875
01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:49.730
Things that love night love notsuch nights as these.

1876
01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:54.100
The wrathful skies gallow thevery wanderers of the night

1877
01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:56.070
and make them keep their caves.

1878
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:59.300
Since I was man, such sheets offire,

1879
01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:01.670
such bursts of horrid thunder,

1880
01:28:01.670 --> 01:28:03.600
such groans of roaring wind andrain,

1881
01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.130
I never remember to have heard.

1882
01:28:06.130 --> 01:28:10.130
Man's nature cannot carry theaffliction nor the fear.

1883
01:28:10.130 --> 01:28:11.770
Let the great gods

1884
01:28:11.770 --> 01:28:14.170
that keep this dreadful pothero'er our heads

1885
01:28:14.170 --> 01:28:18.200
find out their enemies now.

1886
01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:22.470
Tremble, thou wretch, that hathwithin thee

1887
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:26.070
undivulged crimes, unwhipped ofjustice.

1888
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:30.030
Hide thee, thou bloody hand.

1889
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:32.870
Thou perjured, and thou simularman

1890
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:36.700
of virtue that art incestuous.

1891
01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:39.630
Caitiff, to pieces shake,

1892
01:28:39.630 --> 01:28:41.970
that under covert and convenientseeming

1893
01:28:41.970 --> 01:28:45.570
hath practiced on man's life.

1894
01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:50.230
Close pent-up guilts, rive yourconcealing continents,

1895
01:28:50.230 --> 01:28:53.670
and cry these dreadful summonersgrace.

1896
01:28:53.670 --> 01:28:56.330
I am a man more sinned againstthan sinning!

1897
01:28:57.770 --> 01:28:59.230
Alack, bare-headed.

1898
01:28:59.230 --> 01:29:04.370
Gracious my lord, hard by hereis a hovel.

1899
01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:07.130
Some friendship will it lend you'gainst the tempest.

1900
01:29:07.130 --> 01:29:10.900
Repose you there while I to thishard houseÃ³

1901
01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:12.900
more harder than the stoneswhereof 'tis raised,

1902
01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:14.630
which, even but now, demandingafter you,

1903
01:29:14.630 --> 01:29:16.000
denied me to come in

1904
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.130
return and force their scantedcourtesy.

1905
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.630
My wits begin to turn.

1906
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:32.600
Come on, my boy.

1907
01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:36.570
How dost, my boy? Art cold?

1908
01:29:36.570 --> 01:29:39.330
I am cold myself.

1909
01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:42.970
Where is this straw, my fellow?

1910
01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:47.870
The art of our necessities isstrange

1911
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:50.730
that can make vile thingsprecious.

1912
01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:54.030
Come, your hovel.

1913
01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.070
Poor fool and knave,

1914
01:29:58.070 --> 01:30:04.270
I have one part in my heartthat's sorry yet for thee.

1915
01:30:04.270 --> 01:30:09.530
He that hath and a little tinywitÃ³

1916
01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:14.200
with a hey, ho, the wind and therainÃ³

1917
01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:18.500
must make content with hisfortunes fit,

1918
01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:24.330
for the rain, it raineth everyday.

1919
01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:28.500
True, my good boy.

1920
01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:31.830
Come, bring us to your hovel.

1921
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:35.070
This is a brave night to cool acourtesan.

1922
01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:40.470
I'll speak a prophecy ere I go.

1923
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:45.130
When priests are more in wordthan matter,

1924
01:30:45.130 --> 01:30:48.600
when brewers mar their malt withwater,

1925
01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:51.130
when nobles are their tailors'tutors,

1926
01:30:51.130 --> 01:30:55.470
no heretics burned but wenches'suitors,

1927
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:57.970
then shall the realm of Albioncome

1928
01:30:57.970 --> 01:31:00.400
to great confusion.

1929
01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.470
When every case in law is right,

1930
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:05.970
no squire in debt nor no poorknight,

1931
01:31:05.970 --> 01:31:08.070
when slanders do not live intongues

1932
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:10.900
nor cutpurses come not tothrongs,

1933
01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:14.630
when usurers tell their gold i'the field

1934
01:31:14.630 --> 01:31:17.670
and bawds and whores do churchesbuild,

1935
01:31:17.670 --> 01:31:21.800
then comes the time, who livesto see 't,

1936
01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:26.670
when going shall be used withfeet.

1937
01:31:26.670 --> 01:31:31.070
And this prophecy Merlin shallmake,

1938
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:35.330
for I live before his time.

1939
01:31:39.570 --> 01:31:42.800
Alack, alack, Edmund, I like notthis unnatural dealing.

1940
01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:45.730
When I desire their leave that Imight pity him,

1941
01:31:45.730 --> 01:31:47.430
they took from me the use ofmine own house;

1942
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:49.470
charged me, on pain of perpetualdispleasure,

1943
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:51.070
neither to speak of him, entreatfor him,

1944
01:31:51.070 --> 01:31:52.870
or in any way sustain him.

1945
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:54.070
Most savage and unnatural.

1946
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:55.730
Go to; say you nothing.

1947
01:31:55.730 --> 01:31:58.700
There is division between thedukes

1948
01:31:58.700 --> 01:31:59.900
and a worse matter than that.

1949
01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:02.130
I have received a letter thisnight.

1950
01:32:02.130 --> 01:32:03.430
'Tis dangerous to be spoken.

1951
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:05.830
I have locked the letter in mycloset.

1952
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:07.970
These injuries the king nowbears

1953
01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:09.500
will be revenged home.

1954
01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:12.700
There is part of a power alreadyfooted.

1955
01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:14.670
We must incline to the king.

1956
01:32:14.670 --> 01:32:16.800
I will look him and privilyrelieve him.

1957
01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:19.070
Go you and maintain talk withthe duke,

1958
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:21.100
that my charity be not of himperceived.

1959
01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:26.600
If he ask for me, I am ill andgone to bed.

1960
01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:31.330
If I die for it, as no less isthreatened me,

1961
01:32:31.330 --> 01:32:35.700
the king, my old master, must berelieved.

1962
01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:38.300
There are strange things toward,Edmund.

1963
01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:41.070
Pray you, be careful.

1964
01:33:00.970 --> 01:33:03.500
Here is the place, my lord.

1965
01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.530
Good my lord, enter.

1966
01:33:05.530 --> 01:33:08.200
The tyranny of the open night'stoo rough for nature to endure.

1967
01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:09.270
Let me alone.

1968
01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:10.300
Good my lord, enter here.

1969
01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:11.330
Wilt break my heart?

1970
01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:12.470
I had rather break mine own.

1971
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:13.530
Good my lord, enter.

1972
01:33:13.530 --> 01:33:14.830
Thou think'st 'tis much

1973
01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:17.230
that this contentious storminvades us to the skin.

1974
01:33:17.230 --> 01:33:18.930
So 'tis to thee.

1975
01:33:18.930 --> 01:33:21.200
But where the greater malady isfixed,

1976
01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:23.170
the lesser is scarce felt.

1977
01:33:23.170 --> 01:33:25.130
Thou'ldst shun a bear,

1978
01:33:25.130 --> 01:33:27.330
but if thy flight lay toward theroaring sea,

1979
01:33:27.330 --> 01:33:29.800
thou'ldst meet the bear i' themouth.

1980
01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:33.330
When the mind's free, the body'sdelicate.

1981
01:33:33.330 --> 01:33:37.400
The tempest in my mind does frommy senses take all feeling

1982
01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.270
else save what beats there.

1983
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:41.330
Filial ingratitude!

1984
01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:43.770
Is it not as this mouth wouldtear this hand

1985
01:33:43.770 --> 01:33:45.470
for lifting food to it?

1986
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:48.400
But I will punish home.

1987
01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:52.470
No, I will weep no more.

1988
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:57.730
In such a night to shut me out.

1989
01:33:57.730 --> 01:33:59.070
Pour on!

1990
01:33:59.070 --> 01:34:01.600
I will endure!

1991
01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:04.370
In such a night as this.

1992
01:34:04.370 --> 01:34:06.670
O Regan, Goneril.

1993
01:34:06.670 --> 01:34:10.170
Thy old kind father, whose frankheart gave all

1994
01:34:10.170 --> 01:34:12.900
O, that way madness lies.

1995
01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:14.530
Let me shun that. No more ofthat.

1996
01:34:14.530 --> 01:34:16.130
Good my lord, enter here.

1997
01:34:16.130 --> 01:34:20.870
Prithee, go in thyself.

1998
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:22.730
Take thine own ease.

1999
01:34:22.730 --> 01:34:27.000
This tempest will not give meleave

2000
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.030
to ponder on things would hurtme more.

2001
01:34:30.030 --> 01:34:32.700
But I'll go in.

2002
01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:38.800
In, boy. Go first.

2003
01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:46.270
You houseless poverty

2004
01:34:46.270 --> 01:34:50.130
nay, get thee in.

2005
01:34:50.130 --> 01:34:54.600
I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.

2006
01:34:56.570 --> 01:35:01.830
Poor naked wretches, whereso'eryou are,

2007
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:05.230
that bide the pelting of thispitiless storm,

2008
01:35:05.230 --> 01:35:11.470
how shall your houseless headsand unfed sides,

2009
01:35:11.470 --> 01:35:14.270
your looped and windowedraggedness

2010
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:19.370
defend you from seasons such asthese?

2011
01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:26.830
O, I have ta'en too little careof this.

2012
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:30.530
Take physic, pomp.

2013
01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:35.670
Expose thyself to feel whatwretches feel

2014
01:35:35.670 --> 01:35:40.130
that thou mayest shake thesuperflux to them

2015
01:35:40.130 --> 01:35:41.970
and show the heavens more just.

2016
01:35:41.970 --> 01:35:44.800
Fathom and a half, fathom and ahalf!

2017
01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:46.570
Poor Tom!

2018
01:35:46.570 --> 01:35:48.170
Come not in here, nuncle!

2019
01:35:48.170 --> 01:35:49.200
Help me! Help me!

2020
01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:50.530
Give me thy hand.

2021
01:35:50.530 --> 01:35:51.800
Who's there?

2022
01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:54.270
A spirit; he says his name'spoor Tom.

2023
01:35:54.270 --> 01:35:56.970
What art thou that dost grumblethere in the straw?

2024
01:35:56.970 --> 01:35:58.670
Come forth!

2025
01:35:58.670 --> 01:36:00.470
Away!

2026
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:02.500
The foul fiend follows me.

2027
01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:04.370
Through the sharp hawthorn blowsthe cold wind.

2028
01:36:04.370 --> 01:36:05.970
Ha!

2029
01:36:05.970 --> 01:36:07.370
Go to thy cold bed, and warmthee.

2030
01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:08.970
Hast thou given all to thy twodaughters?

2031
01:36:08.970 --> 01:36:10.000
And art thou come to this?

2032
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.430
Who gives anything to poor Tom,

2033
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:13.730
whom the foul fiend hath ledthrough fire and through flame,

2034
01:36:13.730 --> 01:36:16.970
through ford and whirlipool e'erbog and quagmire,

2035
01:36:16.970 --> 01:36:18.500
that hath laid knives under hispillow

2036
01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:19.930
and halters in his pew,

2037
01:36:19.930 --> 01:36:23.470
set ratsbane by his porridge,made film proud of heart

2038
01:36:23.470 --> 01:36:26.030
to ride on a bay trotting-horseover four-inched bridges,

2039
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:28.870
to course his own shadow for atraitor.

2040
01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:30.070
Bless thy five wits.

2041
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:31.470
Tom's a-cold.

2042
01:36:31.470 --> 01:36:33.930
Ah, do de, do de, do de.

2043
01:36:33.930 --> 01:36:37.200
Bless thee from whirlwinds,star-blasting, and taking.

2044
01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:39.230
Do poor Tom some charity, whomthe foul fiend vexes.

2045
01:36:39.230 --> 01:36:41.070
There could I have him now

2046
01:36:41.070 --> 01:36:43.300
and there, there, there, there.

2047
01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:45.730
What, have his daughters broughthim to this pass?

2048
01:36:45.730 --> 01:36:47.700
Couldst thou save nothing?

2049
01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:49.130
Wouldst thou give them all?

2050
01:36:49.130 --> 01:36:52.500
Nay, he reserved a blanket, elsewe had been all shamed.

2051
01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:54.530
Now, all the plagues that in thependulous air

2052
01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:56.900
hang fated o'er men's faultslight on thy daughters!

2053
01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:58.870
He hath no daughters, sir.

2054
01:36:58.870 --> 01:37:00.300
Death, traitor!

2055
01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:01.700
Nothing could have subduednature

2056
01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:03.830
to such a lowness but his unkinddaughters.

2057
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:07.670
Is it the fashion that discardedfathers

2058
01:37:07.670 --> 01:37:10.330
should have thus little mercy ontheir flesh?

2059
01:37:10.330 --> 01:37:12.770
Judicious punishment!

2060
01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:18.200
'Twas this flesh begot thosepelican daughters.

2061
01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.030
This cold night will turn us allto fools and madmen!

2062
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:22.830
Take heed o' the foul fiend.Obey thy parents.

2063
01:37:22.830 --> 01:37:24.130
Keep thy word justly. Swear not.

2064
01:37:24.130 --> 01:37:25.570
Commit not with man's swornspouse.

2065
01:37:25.570 --> 01:37:27.300
Set not thy sweet heart on proudarray.

2066
01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:29.600
Tom's a-cold.

2067
01:37:32.670 --> 01:37:35.400
What hast thou been?

2068
01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:40.230
A serving-man, proud in heartand mind

2069
01:37:40.230 --> 01:37:44.430
that curled my hair, wore glovesin my cap,

2070
01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:46.130
served the lust of my mistress'heart

2071
01:37:46.130 --> 01:37:48.900
and did the act of darkness withher,

2072
01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:51.570
swore as many oaths as I spakewords,

2073
01:37:51.570 --> 01:37:54.270
and broke them in the sweet faceof heaven.

2074
01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:56.270
One that slept in the contrivingof lust

2075
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:59.330
and waked to do it.

2076
01:38:01.130 --> 01:38:06.370
Wine loved I deeply, dicedearly,

2077
01:38:06.370 --> 01:38:08.170
and in woman out-paramoured theTurk.

2078
01:38:08.170 --> 01:38:10.670
False of heart, light of ear,bloody of hand,

2079
01:38:10.670 --> 01:38:13.600
hog in sloth, fox in stealth,wolf in greediness,

2080
01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:16.570
dog in madness, lion in prey.

2081
01:38:16.570 --> 01:38:19.130
Let not the creaking of shoesnor the rustling of silks

2082
01:38:19.130 --> 01:38:20.800
betray thy poor heart to woman.

2083
01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:23.570
Keep thy foot out of brothels,thy hand out of plackets,

2084
01:38:23.570 --> 01:38:26.600
thy pen from lenders' books, anddefy the foul fiend.

2085
01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:30.070
Still through the hawthorn blowsthe cold wind.

2086
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:32.130
Sing sum, mun, nonny.

2087
01:38:32.130 --> 01:38:36.770
Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa!

2088
01:38:36.770 --> 01:38:38.400
Let him trot by.

2089
01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:48.600
Thou wert better in a grave thanto answer

2090
01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:52.000
with thy uncovered body thisextremity of the skies.

2091
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:56.930
Is man no more than this?

2092
01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:58.530
Consider him well.

2093
01:38:58.530 --> 01:39:02.200
Thou owest the worm no silk, thebeast no hide,

2094
01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:05.000
the sheep no wool, the cat noperfume.

2095
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.500
Ha!

2096
01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:10.600
Here's three on 's aresophisticated.

2097
01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:14.200
Thou art the thing itself.

2098
01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:18.800
Unaccommodated man is no more

2099
01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:25.170
but such a poor, bare, forkedanimal as thou art.

2100
01:39:25.170 --> 01:39:27.970
Off, off, you lendings!

2101
01:39:27.970 --> 01:39:30.000
Come unbutton here!

2102
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.300
Be contented!

2103
01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:36.900
'Tis a naughty night to swim in.

2104
01:39:39.170 --> 01:39:41.730
Now a little fire in a darkfield

2105
01:39:41.730 --> 01:39:44.500
were like an old lecher's heart:

2106
01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:48.570
a small spark, all the rest on'sbody cold.

2107
01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:53.600
Look, look, here comes a walkingfire.

2108
01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:56.830
This is the foul fiendFlibbertigibbet.

2109
01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:59.470
He begins at curfew and walkstill the first cock.

2110
01:39:59.470 --> 01:40:04.500
He gives the web and the pin,squints the eye,

2111
01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:06.930
and makes the hare-lip,

2112
01:40:06.930 --> 01:40:08.270
mildews the white wheat,

2113
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:09.730
and hurts the poor creature ofEarth.

2114
01:40:09.730 --> 01:40:11.600
How fares Your Grace?

2115
01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.330
What's he?

2116
01:40:13.330 --> 01:40:14.870
Who's there?

2117
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:16.830
What is't you seek?

2118
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:18.900
What are you there? Your names?

2119
01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:21.570
Poor Tom that eats the swimmingfrog, the toad,

2120
01:40:21.570 --> 01:40:23.330
the tadpole, the wall-newt andthe water;

2121
01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:26.000
that in the fury of his heart,when the foul fiend rages,

2122
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.900
eats cow dung for sallets,

2123
01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:29.870
swallows the old rat and theditch-dog,

2124
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:31.870
drinks the green mantle of thestanding pool;

2125
01:40:31.870 --> 01:40:34.370
that is whipped from tithing totithing

2126
01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:36.000
and stock-punished, andimprisoned;

2127
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.470
that hath had three suits to hisback,

2128
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:40.470
six shirts to his body, horse toride,

2129
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:41.570
and weapon to wear.

2130
01:40:41.570 --> 01:40:43.000
But mice and rats and such smalldeer

2131
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.030
have been Tom's food for sevenlong year.

2132
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:46.830
Beware my follower.

2133
01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:50.270
Peace, Smulkin.

2134
01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:53.500
Peace, thou fiend!

2135
01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:56.370
What, hath Your Grace no bettercompany?

2136
01:40:56.370 --> 01:40:58.270
The prince of darkness is agentleman.

2137
01:40:58.270 --> 01:41:02.570
Modo he's called, and Mahu.

2138
01:41:02.570 --> 01:41:05.270
Our flesh and blood, my lord, isgrown so vile,

2139
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:07.200
that it doth hate what gets it.

2140
01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:08.600
Poor Tom's a-cold.

2141
01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:09.830
Go in with me.

2142
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:11.800
My duty cannot suffer to obey

2143
01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:13.570
in all your daughters' hardcommands.

2144
01:41:13.570 --> 01:41:15.930
Though their injunction be tobar my doors,

2145
01:41:15.930 --> 01:41:18.300
yet have I ventured to come seekyou out

2146
01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:21.500
and bring you where both fireand food is ready.

2147
01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:25.230
First let me talk with thisphilosopher.

2148
01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:31.400
What is the cause of thunder?

2149
01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:33.000
Good my lord, take his offer.

2150
01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.300
Go into the house.

2151
01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:37.530
I'll talk a word with this samelearned Theban.

2152
01:41:37.530 --> 01:41:40.700
What is thy study?

2153
01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:43.070
How to prevent the foul fiendand to kill vermin.

2154
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:46.330
Let me ask you one word inprivate.

2155
01:41:46.330 --> 01:41:48.100
Importune him once more to go,my lord.

2156
01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:49.700
His wits begin to unsettle.

2157
01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:51.000
Canst thou blame him?

2158
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.200
His daughters seek his death.

2159
01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:54.570
Oh, that good Kent!

2160
01:41:54.570 --> 01:41:56.270
He said it would be thus, poorbanished man.

2161
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:57.630
Thou sayest the king grows mad.

2162
01:41:57.630 --> 01:42:00.170
I'll tell thee, friend, I amalmost mad myself.

2163
01:42:00.170 --> 01:42:03.170
I had a son, now outlawed frommy blood.

2164
01:42:03.170 --> 01:42:06.030
He sought my life but lately,very late.

2165
01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:09.430
I loved him, friend no fatherhis son dearer.

2166
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:13.430
Truth to tell thee, the griefhath crazed my wits.

2167
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:15.070
What a night's this.

2168
01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:16.200
I do beseech Your GraceÃ³

2169
01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.730
O, cry your mercy, sir.

2170
01:42:17.730 --> 01:42:19.630
Noble philosopher, your company.

2171
01:42:19.630 --> 01:42:21.370
This way, my lord.

2172
01:42:21.370 --> 01:42:22.730
In there, fellow.

2173
01:42:22.730 --> 01:42:24.570
Good my lord, soothe him.

2174
01:42:24.570 --> 01:42:26.730
Let him take the fellow!

2175
01:42:26.730 --> 01:42:28.600
This way! This way, fellow!

2176
01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:29.930
Come along with us.

2177
01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:32.500
Come. Come.

2178
01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:34.070
No words, no words. Hush!

2179
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:35.800
Child Rowland to the dark towercame.

2180
01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:38.370
His word was still, "Fie, foh,and fum,

2181
01:42:38.370 --> 01:42:40.470
I smell the blood of a Britishman."

2182
01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:53.870
I will have my revenge ereI depart his house.

2183
01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:56.300
How, my lord, I may becensured,

2184
01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:58.500
that nature thus gives wayto loyalty,

2185
01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:01.270
something fears me tothink of.

2186
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:03.570
I now perceive it was notaltogether

2187
01:43:03.570 --> 01:43:06.030
your brother's evildisposition that made himseek his death

2188
01:43:06.030 --> 01:43:08.900
but a provoking merit seta-work

2189
01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:11.530
by a reprovable badness inhimself.

2190
01:43:11.530 --> 01:43:16.600
How malicious is myfortune, that I mustrepent to be just.

2191
01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:18.170
This is the letter hespoke of,

2192
01:43:18.170 --> 01:43:20.030
which approves him anintelligent party

2193
01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:21.670
to the advantages ofFrance.

2194
01:43:21.670 --> 01:43:24.730
O heavens, that thistreason were not

2195
01:43:24.730 --> 01:43:26.830
or not I the detector.

2196
01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:28.900
Go with me to the duchess.

2197
01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:30.630
If the matter of thispaper be certain,

2198
01:43:30.630 --> 01:43:33.770
you have mighty businessin hand.

2199
01:43:33.770 --> 01:43:38.470
True or false, it hath madethee earl of Gloucester.

2200
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:40.370
Seek out where thy fatheris,

2201
01:43:40.370 --> 01:43:42.870
that he may be ready forour apprehension.

2202
01:43:44.670 --> 01:43:47.270
I will persevere in mycourse of loyalty,

2203
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:50.030
though the conflict be sorebetween that and my blood.

2204
01:43:50.030 --> 01:43:52.130
I will lay trust uponthee,

2205
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:56.670
and thou shalt find adearer father in my love.

2206
01:43:56.670 --> 01:43:58.200
Here is better than theopen air.

2207
01:43:58.200 --> 01:43:59.970
Take it thankfully.

2208
01:43:59.970 --> 01:44:02.070
I will piece out the comfortwith what addition I can.

2209
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:03.500
I will not be longfrom you.

2210
01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:05.700
All the power of his witshave given way to hisimpatience.

2211
01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:07.000
The gods reward yourkindness.

2212
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.300
Frateretto calls me

2213
01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:10.570
and tells me Nero is anangler in the lake ofdarkness.

2214
01:44:10.570 --> 01:44:13.930
Pray, innocent, and bewarethe foul fiend.

2215
01:44:13.930 --> 01:44:18.700
Prithee, nuncle, tell mewhether a madman be

2216
01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:20.200
a gentleman or a yeoman.

2217
01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:23.870
A king, a king.

2218
01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:27.600
No, he's a yeoman that hasa gentleman to his son,

2219
01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:29.630
for he's a mad yeoman

2220
01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:32.470
that sees his son agentleman before him.

2221
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:36.470
To have a thousand withred burning spits

2222
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:39.130
come hissing in upon 'em

2223
01:44:39.130 --> 01:44:40.530
The foul fiend bites myback.

2224
01:44:40.530 --> 01:44:43.100
He's mad that trusts inthe tameness of a wolf,

2225
01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:46.700
a horse's health, a boy'slove, or a whore's oath.

2226
01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:51.430
It shall be done; I willarraign them straight.

2227
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:56.630
Come, sit thou here, mostlearned justicer.

2228
01:44:56.630 --> 01:44:59.270
Thou, sapient sir, sitthere.

2229
01:44:59.270 --> 01:45:04.230
Now, you she-foxes!

2230
01:45:04.230 --> 01:45:06.500
Look, where he stands andglares.

2231
01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:08.400
Want'st thou eyes attrial, madam?

2232
01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:10.630
Come o'er the bourn,Bessy, to me.

2233
01:45:10.630 --> 01:45:12.830
Her boat hath a leak, andshe must not speak

2234
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:15.630
why she dare not come overto thee.

2235
01:45:15.630 --> 01:45:17.970
The foul fiend haunts Tom inthe voice of a nightingale.

2236
01:45:17.970 --> 01:45:20.970
Hopdance cries in Tom's bellyfor two white herrings.

2237
01:45:20.970 --> 01:45:24.330
Croak not, black angel; Ihave no food for thee.

2238
01:45:24.330 --> 01:45:25.700
How do you, sir?

2239
01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:27.670
Stand you not so amazed.

2240
01:45:27.670 --> 01:45:30.430
Will you lie down and restupon the cushions?

2241
01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:31.970
I'll see their trialfirst.

2242
01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:33.830
Bring in their evidence.

2243
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:37.430
Thou robed man of justice,take thy place.

2244
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:40.670
And thou, his yoke-fellowof equity,

2245
01:45:40.670 --> 01:45:41.870
bench by his side.

2246
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:43.900
You are o' the commission;sit you too.

2247
01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:45.170
Let us deal justly.

2248
01:45:45.170 --> 01:45:48.930
Arraign her first, 'tisGoneril.

2249
01:45:48.930 --> 01:45:51.100
I here take my oath beforethis honorable assembly,

2250
01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:52.530
she kicked the poor king,her father.

2251
01:45:52.530 --> 01:45:53.770
Come hither, mistress.

2252
01:45:53.770 --> 01:45:55.300
Is your name Goneril?

2253
01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:56.600
She cannot deny it.

2254
01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:59.470
Cry you mercy, I took youfor a joint-stool.

2255
01:45:59.470 --> 01:46:03.770
And there's another, whosewarped looks proclaim

2256
01:46:03.770 --> 01:46:05.930
what store her heart ismade upon.

2257
01:46:05.930 --> 01:46:07.670
Stop her there!

2258
01:46:07.670 --> 01:46:09.800
Arms, arms, sword, fire!

2259
01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:11.230
Corruption in the place!

2260
01:46:11.230 --> 01:46:13.100
False justicer, why didstthou let her 'scape?

2261
01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:14.570
Bless thy wits.

2262
01:46:14.570 --> 01:46:16.700
O pity, sir, where is thepatience now

2263
01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:18.870
that you so oft haveboasted to retain?

2264
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:20.400
My tears begin to take hispart so much,

2265
01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:22.600
they mar mycounterfeiting.

2266
01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:28.070
The little dogs and allTray, Blanch, and Sweetheart

2267
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:29.700
see, they bark at me.

2268
01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:31.100
Tom will throw his head atthem.

2269
01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:33.130
Avaunt, you curs!

2270
01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:41.400
Then let them anatomizeRegan,

2271
01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:46.970
see what breeds about herheart.

2272
01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:52.230
Is there any cause innature that make thesehard hearts?

2273
01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:58.500
You, sir, I entertain forone of my hundred,

2274
01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:01.370
only I do not like thefashion of your garments.

2275
01:47:01.370 --> 01:47:03.800
You will say they arePersian, but let them bechanged.

2276
01:47:05.970 --> 01:47:09.230
Now, good my lord, liehere and rest awhile.

2277
01:47:09.230 --> 01:47:10.970
Hmm?

2278
01:47:19.570 --> 01:47:24.300
Make no noise. Make nonoise.

2279
01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:28.800
Draw the curtains.

2280
01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.600
So.

2281
01:47:32.570 --> 01:47:34.370
So.

2282
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:41.830
We'll go to supper in themorning.

2283
01:47:44.370 --> 01:47:47.900
And I'll go to bed atnoon.

2284
01:47:51.370 --> 01:47:53.000
Come hither, friend.

2285
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.970
Where is the king,my master?

2286
01:47:54.970 --> 01:47:57.100
Here, sir, but trouble himnot; his wits are gone.

2287
01:47:57.100 --> 01:47:59.030
Good friend, I prithee,take him in thine arms.

2288
01:47:59.030 --> 01:48:02.000
I have o'erheard a plot ofdeath upon him.

2289
01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.270
There is a litter ready.

2290
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:05.670
Lay him in 't and drivetoward Dover, friend,

2291
01:48:05.670 --> 01:48:07.900
where thou shalt meet bothwelcome and protection.

2292
01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:09.230
Take up thy master.

2293
01:48:09.230 --> 01:48:10.670
If thou shouldst dallyhalf an hour,

2294
01:48:10.670 --> 01:48:12.270
his life, with thine,

2295
01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:13.500
and all that offer todefend him

2296
01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:15.100
stand of assured loss.

2297
01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:16.430
Take up. Take up.

2298
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:18.200
And follow me, that willto some provision

2299
01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:19.770
give thee quick comfort.

2300
01:48:19.770 --> 01:48:21.170
Oppressed nature sleeps.

2301
01:48:21.170 --> 01:48:24.330
This rest might yet havebalmed thy broken sinews,

2302
01:48:24.330 --> 01:48:25.870
which, if convenience willnot allow,

2303
01:48:25.870 --> 01:48:27.630
stand in hard cure.

2304
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:31.330
Come, help to bear thymaster.

2305
01:48:31.330 --> 01:48:34.070
Come, thou must not staybehind.

2306
01:48:40.630 --> 01:48:45.100
Come, come, away.

2307
01:48:52.470 --> 01:48:57.930
When we our betters seebearing our woes,

2308
01:48:57.930 --> 01:49:02.430
we scarcely think ourmiseries our foes.

2309
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:07.070
Who alone suffers suffersmost in the mind,

2310
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:13.470
leaving free things andhappy shows behind.

2311
01:49:13.470 --> 01:49:16.970
But then the mind muchsufferance doth o'er skip

2312
01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:23.530
when grief hath mates andbearing fellowship.

2313
01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:31.170
How light and portable mypain seems now

2314
01:49:31.170 --> 01:49:36.800
when that which makes mebend makes the king bow.

2315
01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:41.200
He childed as I fathered.

2316
01:49:46.270 --> 01:49:49.100
Tom, away.

2317
01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:52.370
Mark the high noises andthyself bewray

2318
01:49:52.370 --> 01:49:54.470
when false opinion,

2319
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:57.500
whose wrong thoughtsdefile thee,

2320
01:49:57.500 --> 01:50:05.230
in thy just proof repealsand reconciles thee.

2321
01:50:07.930 --> 01:50:12.470
What will hap more tonight,safe 'scape the king.

2322
01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:16.000
Lurk.

2323
01:50:18.530 --> 01:50:20.430
Lurk.

2324
01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:25.230
Post speedily to my lordyour husband.

2325
01:50:25.230 --> 01:50:26.570
Show him this letter.

2326
01:50:26.570 --> 01:50:28.530
The army of France islanded.

2327
01:50:28.530 --> 01:50:30.930
Seek out the traitorGloucester.

2328
01:50:32.570 --> 01:50:34.930
Hang him instantly.

2329
01:50:34.930 --> 01:50:36.830
Pluck out his eyes.

2330
01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:38.630
Leave him to mydispleasure.

2331
01:50:38.630 --> 01:50:41.130
Edmund, keep you oursister company.

2332
01:50:41.130 --> 01:50:42.830
The revenges we are boundto take

2333
01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:45.970
upon your traitorousfather are not fit foryour beholding.

2334
01:50:45.970 --> 01:50:47.730
Advise the duke where youare going,

2335
01:50:47.730 --> 01:50:49.130
to a most festinatepreparation.

2336
01:50:49.130 --> 01:50:50.500
We are bound to the like.

2337
01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:53.200
Our posts shall be swiftand intelligent betwixt us.

2338
01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:55.230
Farewell, dearest sister.

2339
01:50:55.230 --> 01:50:58.970
Farewell, my lord ofGloucester.

2340
01:50:58.970 --> 01:51:01.270
How now? Where's the king?

2341
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:03.530
My lord of Gloucester hathconveyed him hence.

2342
01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:05.500
Some five or six andthirty of his knights,

2343
01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:07.400
hot questrists after him,met him at gate,

2344
01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:09.200
who, with some other ofthe lords dependants,

2345
01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:10.600
are gone with him towardsDover,

2346
01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:12.970
where they boast to havewell-armed friends.

2347
01:51:12.970 --> 01:51:15.100
Get horses for yourmistress.

2348
01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:17.770
Farewell, sweet lord andsister.

2349
01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:22.270
Go seek the traitorGloucester.

2350
01:51:22.270 --> 01:51:23.730
Pinion him like a thief.

2351
01:51:23.730 --> 01:51:26.530
Bring him before us.

2352
01:51:26.530 --> 01:51:28.330
Though well we may notpass upon his life

2353
01:51:28.330 --> 01:51:31.030
without the form ofjustice,

2354
01:51:31.030 --> 01:51:34.430
yet our power shall do acourtesy to our wrath,

2355
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:37.500
which men may blame butnot control.

2356
01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:40.130
Who's there? The traitor?

2357
01:51:40.130 --> 01:51:43.270
Ingrateful fox, 'tis he.

2358
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:45.670
Bind fast his corky arms.

2359
01:51:45.670 --> 01:51:46.970
What means Your Graces?

2360
01:51:46.970 --> 01:51:49.130
Good my friends, consideryou are my guests.

2361
01:51:49.130 --> 01:51:52.000
Do me no foul play,friends.

2362
01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.670
Bind him, I say.

2363
01:51:53.670 --> 01:51:56.230
Hard.

2364
01:51:56.230 --> 01:51:59.130
Hard.

2365
01:51:59.130 --> 01:52:01.400
O filthy traitor!

2366
01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:03.800
Unmerciful lady as youare, I'm none.

2367
01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:05.600
Villain, thou shalt find

2368
01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:08.470
By the kind gods, 'tismost ignobly done

2369
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:09.800
to pluck me by the beard.

2370
01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:12.470
So white, and such atraitor.

2371
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:14.170
Naughty lady, these hairs,

2372
01:52:14.170 --> 01:52:15.600
which thou dost ravishfrom my chin,

2373
01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:17.270
will quicken and accusethee.

2374
01:52:18.630 --> 01:52:20.970
I am your host.

2375
01:52:20.970 --> 01:52:22.900
With robbers' hands,

2376
01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:26.030
my hospitable favors youshould not ruffle thus.

2377
01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:28.770
What will you do?

2378
01:52:28.770 --> 01:52:32.230
Come, sir, what lettershad you late from France?

2379
01:52:32.230 --> 01:52:34.430
Be simple answerer, for weknow the truth.

2380
01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:37.070
And what confederacy haveyou with the traitors

2381
01:52:37.070 --> 01:52:38.400
late footed in thekingdom?

2382
01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:41.130
To whose hands have yousent the lunatic king?

2383
01:52:41.130 --> 01:52:43.370
Speak.

2384
01:52:43.370 --> 01:52:45.030
I have a letter,guessingly set down,

2385
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:47.600
that came from one that'sof a neutral heart

2386
01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:49.130
and not from one opposed.

2387
01:52:49.130 --> 01:52:51.370
Cunning.

2388
01:52:51.370 --> 01:52:53.670
And false.

2389
01:52:53.670 --> 01:52:58.100
Where hast thou sent theking?

2390
01:52:58.100 --> 01:52:59.970
To Dover.

2391
01:52:59.970 --> 01:53:02.600
Wherefore to Dover?

2392
01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:05.200
Wast thou not charged atperil

2393
01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:06.400
Wherefore to Dover?

2394
01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:07.830
Let him first answer that.

2395
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:10.170
I am tied to the stake, andI must stand the course.

2396
01:53:10.170 --> 01:53:12.000
Wherefore to Dover?

2397
01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.600
Because I would not seethy cruel nails

2398
01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:16.970
pluck out his poor oldeyes, nor thy fierce sister

2399
01:53:16.970 --> 01:53:20.300
in his anointed fleshstick boarish fangs.

2400
01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:23.430
But I shall see the wingedvengeance

2401
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:25.030
overtake such children.

2402
01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:27.270
See't shalt thou never.

2403
01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:29.700
Fellows, hold the chair.

2404
01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:32.470
Upon these eyes of thine,I'll set my foot.

2405
01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:34.070
He that will think to livetill he be old,

2406
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:35.270
give me some help!

2407
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:39.030
O cruel!

2408
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:42.030
O ye gods!

2409
01:53:48.570 --> 01:53:53.230
One side will mock theother t'other too.

2410
01:53:55.170 --> 01:53:56.330
If you see vengeance

2411
01:53:56.330 --> 01:53:57.900
Hold your hand, my lord.

2412
01:53:59.670 --> 01:54:01.770
I have served you eversince I was a child,

2413
01:54:01.770 --> 01:54:03.670
but better service have Inever given you

2414
01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:05.000
than now to bid you hold.

2415
01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.230
How now, you dog!

2416
01:54:06.230 --> 01:54:07.930
If you did wear a beardupon your chin,

2417
01:54:07.930 --> 01:54:09.270
I'd shake it on thisquarrel.

2418
01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:10.300
What do you mean?

2419
01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:11.630
My villain!

2420
01:54:11.630 --> 01:54:14.330
Nay, then, come on, andtake the chance of anger.

2421
01:54:14.330 --> 01:54:15.570
Give me thy sword.

2422
01:54:15.570 --> 01:54:18.230
A peasant stand up thus!

2423
01:54:18.230 --> 01:54:20.770
O, I am slain!

2424
01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:27.300
My lord, you have one eyeleft to see some mischiefon him.

2425
01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:31.470
Lest it see more, preventit.

2426
01:54:33.130 --> 01:54:34.600
Out!

2427
01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:40.230
Vile jelly!

2428
01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:45.800
Where is thy luster now?

2429
01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:50.170
Dark and comfortless.

2430
01:54:51.770 --> 01:54:55.170
Where's my son Edmund?

2431
01:54:55.170 --> 01:54:58.870
Edmund, enkindle all thesparks of nature

2432
01:54:58.870 --> 01:55:01.700
to quit this horrid act!

2433
01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:02.830
Out, treacherous villain.

2434
01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:04.700
Thou call'st upon him thathates thee.

2435
01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:08.300
It was he that made theovertures of thy treasonto us,

2436
01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:12.670
who is too good to pitythee.

2437
01:55:12.670 --> 01:55:17.670
O my follies.

2438
01:55:17.670 --> 01:55:20.630
Then Edgar was abused.

2439
01:55:20.630 --> 01:55:28.330
Kind gods, forgive me thatand prosper him.

2440
01:55:28.330 --> 01:55:31.800
Go, thrust him out atgate.

2441
01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:36.630
Let him smell his way toDover.

2442
01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:41.900
How is't with you, mylord?

2443
01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:42.930
How look you?

2444
01:55:42.930 --> 01:55:44.430
I have received a hurt.

2445
01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:46.670
Follow me, lady.

2446
01:55:46.670 --> 01:55:49.070
Turn out that eyelessvillain.

2447
01:55:49.070 --> 01:55:50.830
Throw this slave upon thedunghill.

2448
01:55:50.830 --> 01:55:52.600
Regan, I bleed apace.

2449
01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:54.800
Untimely comes this hurt.

2450
01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:55.970
Give me your arm.

2451
01:55:55.970 --> 01:56:00.670
I'll never care whatwickedness I do

2452
01:56:00.670 --> 01:56:05.330
if this man come to good.

2453
01:56:05.330 --> 01:56:06.670
If she live long

2454
01:56:06.670 --> 01:56:09.330
and, in the end, meet theold course of death,

2455
01:56:09.330 --> 01:56:12.130
women will all turnmonsters.

2456
01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:17.030
I'll get some flax andwhites of eggs

2457
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:19.400
to apply to his bleedingface.

2458
01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:22.200
Now heaven help him.

2459
01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:40.400
Yet better thus and knownto be contemned

2460
01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:43.630
than still contemned andflattered.

2461
01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:48.570
To be worst,

2462
01:56:48.570 --> 01:56:53.000
the lowest and mostdejected thing of fortune,

2463
01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.370
stands still in esperance,lives not in fear.

2464
01:56:57.370 --> 01:57:00.730
The lamentable change isfrom the best.

2465
01:57:03.230 --> 01:57:06.300
The worst returns tolaughter.

2466
01:57:08.670 --> 01:57:09.800
Welcome, then,

2467
01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:12.570
thou unsubstantial airthat I embrace.

2468
01:57:12.570 --> 01:57:15.500
The wretch that thou hastblown unto the worst

2469
01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:18.530
owes nothing to thyblasts.

2470
01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:20.530
But who comes here?

2471
01:57:23.070 --> 01:57:27.300
My father, poorly led?

2472
01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:32.830
World, world, O world.

2473
01:57:32.830 --> 01:57:35.270
But that thy strangemutations make us hate thee,

2474
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:38.500
life would not yield toage.

2475
01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:41.600
O, my good lord, I havebeen your tenant

2476
01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:46.170
and your father's tenantthese fourscore years.

2477
01:57:46.170 --> 01:57:47.530
Away, get thee away.

2478
01:57:47.530 --> 01:57:49.030
Good friend, be gone.

2479
01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:51.570
Thy comforts can do me nogood at all.

2480
01:57:51.570 --> 01:57:54.630
Thee, they may hurt.

2481
01:57:54.630 --> 01:57:57.430
But you cannot see yourway.

2482
01:57:57.430 --> 01:58:03.030
I have no way andtherefore want no eyes.

2483
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:05.230
I stumbled when I saw.

2484
01:58:05.230 --> 01:58:07.530
Full oft 'tis seen, ourmeans secure us,

2485
01:58:07.530 --> 01:58:10.870
and our mere defects proveour commodities.

2486
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:13.800
O dear son Edgar,

2487
01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:17.070
the food of thy abusedfather's wrath.

2488
01:58:17.070 --> 01:58:19.400
Might I but live to seethee in my touch,

2489
01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:22.170
I'd say I had eyes again.

2490
01:58:22.170 --> 01:58:24.100
How now?

2491
01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:26.170
Who's there?

2492
01:58:26.170 --> 01:58:28.200
O gods!

2493
01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:30.800
Who is't can say "I am atthe worst"?

2494
01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:34.330
I am worse than e'er Iwas.

2495
01:58:34.330 --> 01:58:36.700
'Tis poor mad Tom.

2496
01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:38.500
And worse I may be yet.

2497
01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:41.330
The worst is not

2498
01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:46.170
so long as we can say,"This is the worst."

2499
01:58:46.170 --> 01:58:48.700
Fellow, where goest?

2500
01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:50.200
Is it a beggar man?

2501
01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:53.570
Madman and beggar too.

2502
01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:56.600
He has some reason, elsehe could not beg.

2503
01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:59.670
In the last night's storm,I such a fellow saw

2504
01:58:59.670 --> 01:59:02.130
that made me think a man aworm.

2505
01:59:02.130 --> 01:59:04.400
My son came then into mymind,

2506
01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:06.630
and yet my mind was thenscarce friends with him.

2507
01:59:06.630 --> 01:59:09.700
I have heard more since.

2508
01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:14.600
As flies to wanton boysare we to the gods!

2509
01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:17.100
They kill us for theirsport.

2510
01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:19.070
How should this be?

2511
01:59:19.070 --> 01:59:21.600
Bad is the trade that mustplay fool to sorrow,

2512
01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:23.570
angering itself andothers.

2513
01:59:25.670 --> 01:59:28.400
Bless thee, master!

2514
01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:30.230
Is it the naked fellow?

2515
01:59:30.230 --> 01:59:32.530
Aye, my lord.

2516
01:59:32.530 --> 01:59:33.900
Then, prithee, get theegone.

2517
01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.430
If, for my sake, thou wilto'ertake us,

2518
01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:37.230
hence a mile or twain, i'the way toward Dover,

2519
01:59:37.230 --> 01:59:38.870
do it for ancient love,

2520
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:41.670
and bring some coveringfor this naked soul,

2521
01:59:41.670 --> 01:59:43.870
which I'll entreat to leadme.

2522
01:59:43.870 --> 01:59:46.830
Alack, sir, he is mad.

2523
01:59:46.830 --> 01:59:51.930
'Tis the times' plague whenmadmen lead the blind.

2524
01:59:51.930 --> 01:59:55.670
Do as I bid thee, orrather do thy pleasure.

2525
01:59:55.670 --> 01:59:57.370
Above the rest, be gone.

2526
01:59:57.370 --> 02:00:01.330
I'll get him the bestapparel that I have,

2527
02:00:01.330 --> 02:00:05.000
come on't what will.

2528
02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:11.070
Sirrah, naked fellow.

2529
02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.430
Poor Tom's a-cold.

2530
02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:19.670
I cannot daub it further.

2531
02:00:19.670 --> 02:00:22.530
Come hither, fellow.

2532
02:00:22.530 --> 02:00:25.070
And yet I must.

2533
02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:30.300
Bless thy sweet eyes, theybleed.

2534
02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:34.830
Dost thou know the way toDover?

2535
02:00:34.830 --> 02:00:38.600
Both stile and gate,horseway and footpath.

2536
02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:42.630
Poor Tom hath been scaredout of his good wits.

2537
02:00:42.630 --> 02:00:45.030
Bless thee, good man'sson, from the foul fiend!

2538
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:47.470
Five fiends have been inpoor Tom at once:

2539
02:00:47.470 --> 02:00:51.300
of lust, as Obidicut;

2540
02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:54.170
Hobbididence, prince ofdumbness;

2541
02:00:54.170 --> 02:00:57.670
Mahu, of murder; Modo, ofstealing;

2542
02:00:57.670 --> 02:01:01.930
Flibbertigibbet, ofmopping and mowing,

2543
02:01:01.930 --> 02:01:09.200
who since possesseschambermaids and waitingwomen.

2544
02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:12.170
So bless thee, master.

2545
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:16.870
Here, take this purse,

2546
02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:21.300
thou whom the heavens'plagues have humbled toall strokes.

2547
02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:24.470
That I am wretched makesthee the happier.

2548
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:27.330
Heavens, deal so still.

2549
02:01:27.330 --> 02:01:30.030
Let the superfluous andlust-dieted man

2550
02:01:30.030 --> 02:01:31.830
that slaves yourordinance,

2551
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:34.830
that will not see becausehe doth not feel,

2552
02:01:34.830 --> 02:01:37.370
feel your power quickly.

2553
02:01:37.370 --> 02:01:41.570
So distribution shouldundo excess

2554
02:01:41.570 --> 02:01:45.000
and each man have enough.

2555
02:01:48.670 --> 02:01:52.270
Dost thou know Dover?

2556
02:01:52.270 --> 02:01:54.330
Aye, master.

2557
02:01:54.330 --> 02:01:57.230
There is a cliff, whosehigh and bending head

2558
02:01:57.230 --> 02:01:58.970
looks fearfully in theconfined deep.

2559
02:01:58.970 --> 02:02:02.230
Bring me but to the verybrim of it,

2560
02:02:02.230 --> 02:02:04.570
and I'll repair the miserythou dost bear

2561
02:02:04.570 --> 02:02:06.770
with something rich aboutme.

2562
02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:12.500
From that place, I shallno leading need.

2563
02:02:16.730 --> 02:02:18.770
Give me thy hand.

2564
02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:23.870
Poor Tom shall lead thee.

2565
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:25.730
Welcome, my lord.

2566
02:02:25.730 --> 02:02:29.330
I marvel our mild husbandnot met us on the way.

2567
02:02:29.330 --> 02:02:31.970
Now, where's your master?

2568
02:02:31.970 --> 02:02:34.630
Madam, within, but neverman so changed.

2569
02:02:34.630 --> 02:02:36.500
I told him of the armythat was landed;

2570
02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:37.930
he smiled at it.

2571
02:02:37.930 --> 02:02:40.500
I told him you werecoming; his answer was,"The worse."

2572
02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:41.570
Of Gloucester's treachery

2573
02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:43.200
and of the loyal serviceof his son,

2574
02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:45.500
when I informed him, thenhe called me sot

2575
02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:47.830
and told me I had turnedthe wrong side out.

2576
02:02:47.830 --> 02:02:50.700
What most he shoulddislike seems pleasant tohim;

2577
02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:52.930
what like, offensive.

2578
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:57.600
Then shall you go nofurther.

2579
02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:00.300
It is the cowish terror ofhis spirit

2580
02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:01.730
that dares not undertake.

2581
02:03:01.730 --> 02:03:05.770
He'll not feel wrongswhich tie him to ananswer.

2582
02:03:05.770 --> 02:03:10.270
Our wishes on the way mayprove effects.

2583
02:03:10.270 --> 02:03:12.930
Back, Edmund, to mybrother.

2584
02:03:12.930 --> 02:03:16.000
Hasten his musters, andconduct his powers.

2585
02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.770
I must change arms at home

2586
02:03:17.770 --> 02:03:21.130
and give the distaff intomy husband's hands.

2587
02:03:21.130 --> 02:03:23.870
This trusty servant shallpass between us.

2588
02:03:23.870 --> 02:03:27.700
Ere long you are like tohear,

2589
02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:30.900
if you dare venture inyour own behalf,

2590
02:03:30.900 --> 02:03:33.100
a mistress's command.

2591
02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:37.130
Wear this.

2592
02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:42.100
No, spare speech.

2593
02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:45.430
Decline your head.

2594
02:03:52.170 --> 02:03:56.270
This kiss, if it durstspeak,

2595
02:03:56.270 --> 02:04:01.030
would stretch thy spiritsup into the air.

2596
02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:14.830
Conceive, and fare theewell.

2597
02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:19.800
Yours in the ranks ofdeath.

2598
02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:22.500
My most dear Gloucester.

2599
02:04:26.930 --> 02:04:31.700
O, the difference of manand man.

2600
02:04:31.700 --> 02:04:35.270
To thee, a woman'sservices are due.

2601
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:40.730
My fool usurps my body.

2602
02:04:40.730 --> 02:04:43.200
Madam, here comes my lord.

2603
02:04:48.030 --> 02:04:50.730
I have been worth thewhistle.

2604
02:04:50.730 --> 02:04:53.130
O Goneril.

2605
02:04:53.130 --> 02:04:55.830
You are not worth the dust

2606
02:04:55.830 --> 02:04:59.070
which the rude wind blowsin your face.

2607
02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:04.830
I fear your disposition.

2608
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:06.570
That nature, whichcontemns its origin,

2609
02:05:06.570 --> 02:05:08.730
cannot be bordered certainin itself.

2610
02:05:08.730 --> 02:05:11.830
She that herself willsliver and disbranch

2611
02:05:11.830 --> 02:05:13.800
from her material sap

2612
02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:16.500
perforce must wither andcome to deadly use.

2613
02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:18.600
No more; the text isfoolish.

2614
02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:21.430
Wisdom and goodness to thevile seem vile.

2615
02:05:21.430 --> 02:05:25.130
Filths savor butthemselves.

2616
02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.270
What have you done?

2617
02:05:30.270 --> 02:05:34.200
Tigers, not daughters,what have you performed?

2618
02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:36.500
A father and a graciousaged man

2619
02:05:36.500 --> 02:05:39.730
whose reverence even thehead-lugged bear would lick

2620
02:05:39.730 --> 02:05:41.270
most barbarous, mostdegenerate,

2621
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:43.930
have you madded.

2622
02:05:43.930 --> 02:05:47.270
Could my good brothersuffer you to do it?

2623
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:50.230
A man, a prince, by him sobenefited?

2624
02:05:50.230 --> 02:05:54.270
If that the heavens do nottheir visible spirits

2625
02:05:54.270 --> 02:05:56.600
send quickly down to tamethese vile offenses,

2626
02:05:56.600 --> 02:05:57.930
it will come.

2627
02:05:57.930 --> 02:06:00.700
Humanity must perforceprey on itself

2628
02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:02.370
like monsters of the deep.

2629
02:06:02.370 --> 02:06:03.800
Milk-livered man

2630
02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:06.130
that bear'st a cheek forblows, a head for wrongs,

2631
02:06:06.130 --> 02:06:07.470
who hast not in thy brows

2632
02:06:07.470 --> 02:06:09.970
an eye discerning thinehonor from thy suffering,

2633
02:06:09.970 --> 02:06:13.230
that not know'st fools dothose villains pity

2634
02:06:13.230 --> 02:06:17.530
who are punished ere theyhave done their mischief.

2635
02:06:17.530 --> 02:06:19.530
Where's thy drum?

2636
02:06:19.530 --> 02:06:24.030
France spreads his bannersin our noiseless land.

2637
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:26.000
With plumed helm, thystate begins to threat

2638
02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.300
whilst thou, a moral fool,

2639
02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:30.370
sit'st still and criest,"Alack, why does he so?"

2640
02:06:30.370 --> 02:06:31.870
See thyself, devil.

2641
02:06:31.870 --> 02:06:33.430
Proper deformity shows notin the fiend

2642
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:34.700
so horrid as in woman.

2643
02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:36.070
O, vain fool!

2644
02:06:36.070 --> 02:06:38.030
Thou changed and self-coveredthing, for shame.

2645
02:06:38.030 --> 02:06:40.230
Be-monster not thyfeature.

2646
02:06:40.230 --> 02:06:42.500
Were it my fitness to letthese hands obey my blood,

2647
02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:45.670
they are apt enough todislocate and tear thyflesh and bones.

2648
02:06:45.670 --> 02:06:48.100
Howe'er thou art a fiend,

2649
02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:50.170
a woman's shape dothshield thee.

2650
02:06:50.170 --> 02:06:55.300
Marry, your manhood.

2651
02:06:55.300 --> 02:06:56.570
What news?

2652
02:06:56.570 --> 02:06:59.530
O, my good lord, the Dukeof Cornwall's dead,

2653
02:06:59.530 --> 02:07:00.770
slain by his servant,

2654
02:07:00.770 --> 02:07:02.930
going to put out the othereye of Gloucester.

2655
02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:06.730
Gloucester's eye?

2656
02:07:06.730 --> 02:07:09.000
A servant that he bred,thrilled with remorse,

2657
02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.270
opposed against the act,

2658
02:07:10.270 --> 02:07:12.330
bending his sword to hisgreat master,

2659
02:07:12.330 --> 02:07:14.100
who, thereat enraged, flewon him

2660
02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:15.900
and amongst them felledhim dead

2661
02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:17.700
but not without thatharmful stroke

2662
02:07:17.700 --> 02:07:19.770
which since hath pluckedhim after.

2663
02:07:19.770 --> 02:07:21.630
This shows you are above,you justicers,

2664
02:07:21.630 --> 02:07:25.430
that these, our nethercrimes, so speedily canvenge.

2665
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:27.600
O poor Gloucester, lost hehis other eye?

2666
02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:29.600
Both, both, my lord.

2667
02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:31.930
This letter, madam, cravesa speedy answer.

2668
02:07:31.930 --> 02:07:33.600
'Tis from your sister.

2669
02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:36.330
One way I like this well.

2670
02:07:36.330 --> 02:07:41.900
But being widow and myGloucester with her,

2671
02:07:41.900 --> 02:07:43.970
may all the building of myfancy pluck

2672
02:07:43.970 --> 02:07:46.330
upon my hateful life.

2673
02:07:49.070 --> 02:07:51.730
Another way, the news isnot so tart.

2674
02:07:53.730 --> 02:07:55.600
I'll read and answer.

2675
02:07:57.830 --> 02:08:01.530
Where was his son whenthey did take his eyes?

2676
02:08:01.530 --> 02:08:02.870
Come with my lady hither.

2677
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:04.030
He is not here.

2678
02:08:04.030 --> 02:08:05.770
No, my good lord; I methim back again.

2679
02:08:05.770 --> 02:08:07.230
Knows he the wickedness?

2680
02:08:07.230 --> 02:08:09.870
Aye, my good lord; 'twashe informed against him

2681
02:08:09.870 --> 02:08:11.730
and quit the house onpurpose

2682
02:08:11.730 --> 02:08:14.370
that their punishmentmight have the freercourse.

2683
02:08:14.370 --> 02:08:16.030
Gloucester, I live tothank thee

2684
02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:17.730
for the love thou show'dstthe king

2685
02:08:17.730 --> 02:08:22.800
and to revenge thine eyes.

2686
02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:25.330
Come hither, friend. Tellme what more thou know'st.

2687
02:08:30.630 --> 02:08:32.370
Alack, 'tis he.

2688
02:08:32.370 --> 02:08:35.400
Why, he was met even nowas mad as the vexed sea,

2689
02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:36.700
singing aloud,

2690
02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:39.500
crowned with rank fumiterand furrow-weeds,

2691
02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:43.200
with hardocks, hemlock,nettles, cuckoo-flowers,Darnel,

2692
02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:46.370
and all the idle weedsthat grow in oursustaining corn.

2693
02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:49.800
A century send forth.

2694
02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:51.830
Search every acre in thehigh-grown field,

2695
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:53.770
and bring him to our eye.

2696
02:08:56.430 --> 02:08:57.730
What can man's wisdom

2697
02:08:57.730 --> 02:08:59.770
in the restoring hisbereaved sense?

2698
02:08:59.770 --> 02:09:02.600
He that helps him take allmy outward worth.

2699
02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:04.500
There is means, madam.

2700
02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:07.170
Our foster-nurse of natureis repose,

2701
02:09:07.170 --> 02:09:08.470
the which he lacks.

2702
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:11.570
That to provoke in him aremany simples operative

2703
02:09:11.570 --> 02:09:14.670
whose power will close theeye of anguish.

2704
02:09:14.670 --> 02:09:16.000
All blest secrets,

2705
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.070
all you unpublishedvirtues of the Earth,

2706
02:09:18.070 --> 02:09:20.100
spring with my tears.

2707
02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:24.300
Be aidant and remediate inthe good man's distress.

2708
02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:28.130
Seek, seek for him, lesthis ungoverned rage

2709
02:09:28.130 --> 02:09:31.130
dissolve the life thatwants the means to lead it.

2710
02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:33.500
News, madam.

2711
02:09:33.500 --> 02:09:35.300
The British powers aremarching hitherward.

2712
02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:36.470
'Tis known before;

2713
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:39.200
our preparation stands inexpectation of them.

2714
02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:47.770
O dear father,

2715
02:09:47.770 --> 02:09:52.200
it is thy business that Igo about.

2716
02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:53.770
Therefore, great France

2717
02:09:53.770 --> 02:09:57.000
my mourning and importunetears hath pitied.

2718
02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:00.930
No blown ambition doth ourarms incite

2719
02:10:00.930 --> 02:10:08.500
but love, dear love, andour aged father's right.

2720
02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:15.000
Soon may I hear and seehim.

2721
02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.670
But are my brother'spowers set forth?

2722
02:10:17.670 --> 02:10:18.870
Aye, madam.

2723
02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:21.500
Himself in person there?

2724
02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:23.200
Madam, with much ado.

2725
02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:26.100
Your sister is the bettersoldier.

2726
02:10:27.730 --> 02:10:30.200
Lord Edmund spoke not toyour lord at home?

2727
02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:31.670
No, madam.

2728
02:10:31.670 --> 02:10:34.770
What might import mysister's letter to him?

2729
02:10:34.770 --> 02:10:36.130
I know not, lady.

2730
02:10:36.130 --> 02:10:38.870
'Faith, he is posted henceon serious matter.

2731
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:42.130
It was great ignorance,Gloucester's eyes being out,

2732
02:10:42.130 --> 02:10:44.230
to let him live.

2733
02:10:44.230 --> 02:10:47.400
Where he arrives, he movesall hearts against us.

2734
02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:50.770
Edmund, I think, is gone,in pity of his misery,

2735
02:10:50.770 --> 02:10:52.730
to dispatch his nightedlife

2736
02:10:52.730 --> 02:10:55.830
moreover, to descry thestrength o' the enemy.

2737
02:10:55.830 --> 02:10:58.730
I must needs after him,madam, with my letter.

2738
02:10:58.730 --> 02:11:02.070
Our troops set forthtomorrow.

2739
02:11:02.070 --> 02:11:04.600
Stay with us; the ways aredangerous.

2740
02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:06.170
I may not, madam.

2741
02:11:06.170 --> 02:11:08.270
My lady charged my duty inthis business.

2742
02:11:08.270 --> 02:11:10.130
Why should she write toEdmund?

2743
02:11:10.130 --> 02:11:14.130
Might not you transporther purposes by word?

2744
02:11:14.130 --> 02:11:20.830
Belike, somethings I knownot what.

2745
02:11:20.830 --> 02:11:22.930
I'll love thee much; letme unseal the letter.

2746
02:11:22.930 --> 02:11:24.100
Madam, I had rather

2747
02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:25.770
I know your lady does notlove her husband.

2748
02:11:25.770 --> 02:11:27.170
I'm sure of that.

2749
02:11:27.170 --> 02:11:30.870
And at her late beinghere, she gave strangeoeillades

2750
02:11:30.870 --> 02:11:33.930
and most speaking looks tonoble Edmund.

2751
02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:38.030
- I know you are of herbosom. - I?

2752
02:11:38.030 --> 02:11:41.400
I speak in understanding.You are; I know it.

2753
02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:45.570
Therefore I do advisethee, take this note.

2754
02:11:45.570 --> 02:11:48.000
My lord is dead.

2755
02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.730
Edmund and I have talked.

2756
02:11:49.730 --> 02:11:52.270
And more convenient is hefor my hand

2757
02:11:52.270 --> 02:11:54.670
than for your lady's.

2758
02:11:54.670 --> 02:11:58.970
You may gather more.

2759
02:11:58.970 --> 02:12:02.370
If you do find him, prayyou, give him this.

2760
02:12:02.370 --> 02:12:08.130
And when your mistresshears thus much from you,I pray,

2761
02:12:08.130 --> 02:12:11.130
desire her call her wisdomto her.

2762
02:12:12.570 --> 02:12:15.130
And so farewell.

2763
02:12:16.900 --> 02:12:20.100
If you do chance to hearof that blind traitor,

2764
02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:25.230
preferment falls on himthat cuts him off.

2765
02:12:25.230 --> 02:12:26.870
Would I could meet him,madam.

2766
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:29.400
I should show what party Ido follow.

2767
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:33.770
Fare thee well.

2768
02:12:42.230 --> 02:12:45.830
When shall I come to thetop of that same hill?

2769
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:47.400
You do climb up it now.

2770
02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:48.800
Look how we labor.

2771
02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:51.130
Methinks the ground iseven.

2772
02:12:51.130 --> 02:12:52.400
Horrible steep.

2773
02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:54.400
Hark, do you hear the sea?

2774
02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:56.100
No, truly.

2775
02:12:56.100 --> 02:12:57.800
Why, then, your othersenses grow imperfect

2776
02:12:57.800 --> 02:12:59.300
by your eyes' anguish.

2777
02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:01.370
So may it be, indeed.

2778
02:13:01.370 --> 02:13:04.370
Methinks thy voice isaltered and thou speak'st

2779
02:13:04.370 --> 02:13:06.300
in better phrase andmatter than thou didst.

2780
02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:07.470
You are much deceived.

2781
02:13:07.470 --> 02:13:09.230
In nothing am I changedbut in my garments.

2782
02:13:09.230 --> 02:13:10.500
Methinks you're betterspoken.

2783
02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:12.670
Come on, sir.

2784
02:13:12.670 --> 02:13:14.070
Here's the place.

2785
02:13:16.730 --> 02:13:19.300
Stand still.

2786
02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:34.670
How fearful and dizzy 'tisto cast one's eyes so low.

2787
02:13:36.130 --> 02:13:39.330
The crows and choughs thatwing the midway air

2788
02:13:39.330 --> 02:13:43.170
show scarce so gross asbeetles.

2789
02:13:43.170 --> 02:13:45.330
Halfway down hangs one

2790
02:13:45.330 --> 02:13:51.370
that gathers samphire,dreadful trade.

2791
02:13:51.370 --> 02:13:54.930
Methinks he seems nobigger than his head.

2792
02:13:54.930 --> 02:13:57.030
The fishermen that walkupon the beach

2793
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:59.930
appear like mice

2794
02:13:59.930 --> 02:14:05.500
and yond tall anchoring bark,diminished to her cock,

2795
02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:08.930
her cock a buoy almost toosmall for sight.

2796
02:14:08.930 --> 02:14:10.230
The murmuring surge

2797
02:14:10.230 --> 02:14:12.430
that on the unnumberedidle pebbles chafes

2798
02:14:12.430 --> 02:14:15.500
cannot be heard so high.

2799
02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:21.030
I'll look no more lest mybrain turn

2800
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:24.970
and the deficient sighttopple down headlong.

2801
02:14:24.970 --> 02:14:26.930
Set me where you stand.

2802
02:14:26.930 --> 02:14:29.300
Give me your hand.

2803
02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:35.330
You are now within a footof the extreme verge.

2804
02:14:35.330 --> 02:14:38.870
For all beneath the moonwould I not leap upright.

2805
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:40.530
Let go my hand.

2806
02:14:40.530 --> 02:14:44.400
Here, friend, 's anotherpurse,

2807
02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:46.970
in it a jewel well worth apoor man's taking.

2808
02:14:46.970 --> 02:14:49.270
Fairies and gods prosperit with thee.

2809
02:14:49.270 --> 02:14:51.600
Go thou further off.

2810
02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:55.630
Bid me farewell, and letme hear thee going.

2811
02:14:55.630 --> 02:14:57.970
Now fare you well, goodsir!

2812
02:14:57.970 --> 02:15:00.100
With all my heart.

2813
02:15:00.100 --> 02:15:01.600
Why I do trifle thus withhis despair

2814
02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:03.030
is done to cure it.

2815
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:05.270
O you mighty gods.

2816
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:07.270
This world I do renounceand, in your sights,

2817
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:10.400
shake patiently my greataffliction off.

2818
02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:12.970
If I could bear it longerand not fall to quarrel

2819
02:15:12.970 --> 02:15:15.270
with your great opposelesswills,

2820
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:18.130
my snuff and loathed partof nature

2821
02:15:18.130 --> 02:15:19.800
should burn itself out.

2822
02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:24.300
If Edgar live, O, blesshim.

2823
02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:28.800
Now, fellow, fare theewell.

2824
02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:31.530
Gone, sir! Farewell!

2825
02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:36.700
And yet I know not howconceit may rob thetreasury of life

2826
02:15:36.700 --> 02:15:38.930
when life itself yields tothe theft.

2827
02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:42.300
Had he been where hethought, by this, hadthought been past.

2828
02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:45.470
Alive or dead?

2829
02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:49.870
Ho, you sir.

2830
02:15:50.970 --> 02:15:52.800
Friend?

2831
02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:55.670
Hear you, sir.

2832
02:15:55.670 --> 02:15:58.500
Speak.

2833
02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:01.370
Thus might he pass indeed.

2834
02:16:01.370 --> 02:16:03.100
Yet he revives.

2835
02:16:03.100 --> 02:16:05.400
What are you, sir?

2836
02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:08.330
Away, and let me die.

2837
02:16:08.330 --> 02:16:11.670
Hadst thou been aught butgossamer, feathers, air,

2838
02:16:11.670 --> 02:16:14.970
so many fathoms downprecipitating,

2839
02:16:14.970 --> 02:16:16.700
thou'dst shiver'st like anegg.

2840
02:16:16.700 --> 02:16:19.530
But thou dost breathe,hast heavy substance,

2841
02:16:19.530 --> 02:16:22.830
bleed'st not, speak'st,art sound.

2842
02:16:22.830 --> 02:16:24.900
Ten masts at each make notthe altitude

2843
02:16:24.900 --> 02:16:26.670
which thou hastperpendicularly fell.

2844
02:16:26.670 --> 02:16:28.330
Thy life's a miracle.

2845
02:16:28.330 --> 02:16:29.830
Speak yet again.

2846
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:31.330
Have I fallen, or no?

2847
02:16:31.330 --> 02:16:33.730
From the dread summit ofthis chalky bourn.

2848
02:16:33.730 --> 02:16:35.030
Look up a-height.

2849
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:37.270
The shrill-gorged lark cannotbe seen or heard so far.

2850
02:16:37.270 --> 02:16:38.300
Do but look up.

2851
02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:40.900
Alack, I have no eyes.

2852
02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:43.800
Is wretchedness deprivedthat benefit

2853
02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:46.200
to end itself by death?

2854
02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:47.670
'Twas yet some comfort,

2855
02:16:47.670 --> 02:16:50.270
when misery could beguilethe tyrant's rage

2856
02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:53.170
and frustrate his proudwill.

2857
02:16:53.170 --> 02:16:54.230
Give me your arm.

2858
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:55.770
Up.

2859
02:16:55.770 --> 02:16:57.330
So.

2860
02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:02.430
How is 't?

2861
02:17:02.430 --> 02:17:03.770
Feel you your legs?

2862
02:17:03.770 --> 02:17:04.830
You stand.

2863
02:17:04.830 --> 02:17:06.830
Too well, too well.

2864
02:17:06.830 --> 02:17:08.830
This is above allstrangeness.

2865
02:17:08.830 --> 02:17:10.970
Upon the crown o' thecliff,

2866
02:17:10.970 --> 02:17:14.570
what thing was that whichparted from you?

2867
02:17:14.570 --> 02:17:17.330
A poor unfortunate beggar.

2868
02:17:17.330 --> 02:17:18.430
As I stood here below,

2869
02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:21.130
methought his eyes weretwo full moons.

2870
02:17:21.130 --> 02:17:23.600
He had a thousand noses,

2871
02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:28.730
horns whelked and wavedlike the enridged sea.

2872
02:17:28.730 --> 02:17:30.670
It was some fiend.

2873
02:17:30.670 --> 02:17:35.770
Therefore, thou happyfather, think that theclearest gods,

2874
02:17:35.770 --> 02:17:38.470
who make them honors ofmen's impossibilities,

2875
02:17:38.470 --> 02:17:40.400
have preserved thee.

2876
02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:42.430
I do remember now.

2877
02:17:42.430 --> 02:17:45.600
Henceforth, I'll bearaffliction

2878
02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:50.030
till it do cry out itself,"Enough, enough," and die.

2879
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:53.300
That thing you speak of, Itook it for a man.

2880
02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:56.030
Often 'twould say, "Thefiend, the fiend."

2881
02:17:56.030 --> 02:17:57.670
He led me to that place.

2882
02:17:57.670 --> 02:18:00.400
Bear free and patientthoughts.

2883
02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:01.630
Huh?

2884
02:18:01.630 --> 02:18:03.930
Who comes here?

2885
02:18:08.970 --> 02:18:12.730
No, they cannot touch mefor coining;

2886
02:18:12.730 --> 02:18:14.630
I am the king himself.

2887
02:18:14.630 --> 02:18:16.130
O thou side-piercingsight.

2888
02:18:16.130 --> 02:18:18.100
Nature's above art in thatrespect.

2889
02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:23.100
There's your press-money.

2890
02:18:23.100 --> 02:18:26.270
The fellow handles his bowlike a crow-keeper.

2891
02:18:26.270 --> 02:18:29.500
Draw me a clothier's yard!

2892
02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:35.300
Look, look, a mouse.

2893
02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:39.800
See, see, this piece oftoasted cheese will do it.

2894
02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:55.770
There's my gauntlet.

2895
02:18:55.770 --> 02:18:58.100
I'll prove it on a giant.

2896
02:18:59.470 --> 02:19:01.900
Bring up the brown bills!

2897
02:19:03.330 --> 02:19:09.770
O, well flown, bird.

2898
02:19:09.770 --> 02:19:13.970
I' the clout, i' theclout, pssshw!

2899
02:19:13.970 --> 02:19:15.830
Give the word.

2900
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:16.970
Sweet marjoram.

2901
02:19:16.970 --> 02:19:18.000
Pass.

2902
02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.370
I know that voice.

2903
02:19:19.370 --> 02:19:21.430
Ah!

2904
02:19:21.430 --> 02:19:23.200
Goneril, with a whitebeard!

2905
02:19:25.070 --> 02:19:26.570
They flattered me like adog,

2906
02:19:26.570 --> 02:19:28.630
told me I had white hairsin my beard

2907
02:19:28.630 --> 02:19:30.270
before the black ones werethere.

2908
02:19:30.270 --> 02:19:34.400
To say "aye" and "no" toeverything that I said.

2909
02:19:36.330 --> 02:19:40.630
"Aye" and "no" too was nogood divinity.

2910
02:19:42.130 --> 02:19:47.330
When the rain came to wetme once

2911
02:19:47.330 --> 02:19:50.900
and the wind to make mechatter,

2912
02:19:50.900 --> 02:19:54.070
when the thunder would notpeace at my bidding,

2913
02:19:54.070 --> 02:19:55.930
there I found 'em.

2914
02:19:55.930 --> 02:19:57.130
There I smelt 'em out.

2915
02:19:57.130 --> 02:19:58.630
Go to, they're not men o'their words.

2916
02:19:58.630 --> 02:20:00.600
They told me I waseverything.

2917
02:20:00.600 --> 02:20:03.200
'Tis a lie; I am notague-proof.

2918
02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:04.930
The trick of that voice Ido well remember.

2919
02:20:04.930 --> 02:20:07.500
Is it not the king?

2920
02:20:07.500 --> 02:20:19.700
Aye, every inch a king.

2921
02:20:19.700 --> 02:20:22.070
When I do stare, see howthe subject quakes.

2922
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:28.130
I pardon that man's life.

2923
02:20:28.130 --> 02:20:28.500
What was thy cause?

2924
02:20:28.500 --> 02:20:29.800
Adultery?

2925
02:20:31.130 --> 02:20:32.370
Thou shalt not die.

2926
02:20:32.370 --> 02:20:34.600
Die for adultery? No.

2927
02:20:34.600 --> 02:20:36.700
The wren goes to 't.

2928
02:20:36.700 --> 02:20:40.770
The small gilded fly doeslecher in my sight.

2929
02:20:40.770 --> 02:20:43.570
Let copulation thrive,

2930
02:20:43.570 --> 02:20:46.800
for Gloucester's bastardson was kinder to hisfather

2931
02:20:46.800 --> 02:20:50.300
than my daughters got'tween the lawful sheets.

2932
02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:55.200
To it, luxury, pell-mell.

2933
02:21:00.130 --> 02:21:02.670
For I lack soldiers.

2934
02:21:04.500 --> 02:21:07.030
Behold yond simperingdame,

2935
02:21:07.030 --> 02:21:10.300
whose face between herforks presages snow,

2936
02:21:10.300 --> 02:21:13.630
that minces virtue

2937
02:21:13.630 --> 02:21:17.330
and does shake the head tohear of pleasure's name.

2938
02:21:17.330 --> 02:21:18.800
The fitchew, nor thesoiled horse,

2939
02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:21.070
goes to 't with a moreriotous appetite.

2940
02:21:21.070 --> 02:21:24.700
Down from the waist, theyare centaurs,

2941
02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:26.930
though women all above.

2942
02:21:26.930 --> 02:21:29.170
But to the girdle do thegods inherit;

2943
02:21:29.170 --> 02:21:31.630
beneath is all thefiends'.

2944
02:21:31.630 --> 02:21:36.400
There's hell, there'sdarkness, there is thesulfurous pit.

2945
02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:40.500
Burning, scalding, stench,consumption.

2946
02:21:40.500 --> 02:21:41.830
Fie, fie, fie!

2947
02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:44.500
Agh!

2948
02:21:44.500 --> 02:21:46.430
Give me an ounce of civet,good apothecary,

2949
02:21:46.430 --> 02:21:48.330
to sweeten my imagination.

2950
02:21:48.330 --> 02:21:50.170
There's money for thee.

2951
02:21:50.170 --> 02:21:51.870
O, let me kiss that hand.

2952
02:21:51.870 --> 02:21:56.470
Let me wipe it first; itsmells of mortality.

2953
02:21:56.470 --> 02:21:58.430
O ruined piece of nature.

2954
02:21:58.430 --> 02:22:01.170
This great world shall sowear out to naught.

2955
02:22:01.170 --> 02:22:04.600
Dost thou know me?

2956
02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:09.070
I remember thine eyes wellenough.

2957
02:22:12.300 --> 02:22:13.870
Dost squinny at me?

2958
02:22:13.870 --> 02:22:17.470
No, do thy worst, blindCupid;

2959
02:22:17.470 --> 02:22:20.700
I'll not love.

2960
02:22:26.030 --> 02:22:28.330
Read thou this challenge.

2961
02:22:28.330 --> 02:22:30.200
Mark but the penning ofit.

2962
02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:34.470
Were all thy letters suns,I could not see one.

2963
02:22:34.470 --> 02:22:36.300
I would not take this fromreport.

2964
02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:38.300
It is, and my heart breaksat it.

2965
02:22:38.300 --> 02:22:39.370
Read!

2966
02:22:39.370 --> 02:22:41.100
What, with the case ofeyes?

2967
02:22:41.100 --> 02:22:42.670
O, ho, are you there withme?

2968
02:22:42.670 --> 02:22:45.970
No eyes in your head norno money in your purse?

2969
02:22:45.970 --> 02:22:49.930
Your eyes are in a heavy caseand your purse in a light.

2970
02:22:49.930 --> 02:22:52.870
Yet you may see how thisworld goes.

2971
02:22:52.870 --> 02:22:55.100
I see it feelingly.

2972
02:22:55.100 --> 02:22:56.830
What, art mad?

2973
02:22:56.830 --> 02:22:59.500
A man may see how thisworld goes with no eyes.

2974
02:22:59.500 --> 02:23:02.000
Look with thine ears.

2975
02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:07.470
See how yond justice railson yond simple thief.

2976
02:23:07.470 --> 02:23:08.500
Hark, in thine ear.

2977
02:23:08.500 --> 02:23:10.470
Change places and,handy-dandy,

2978
02:23:10.470 --> 02:23:13.700
which is the justice andwhich the thief?

2979
02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:16.430
Hast seen a farmer's dogbark at a beggar?

2980
02:23:16.430 --> 02:23:17.470
Aye, sir.

2981
02:23:17.470 --> 02:23:19.100
And the creature run fromthe cur?

2982
02:23:19.100 --> 02:23:25.800
There thou mightst beholdthe great image ofauthority.

2983
02:23:27.170 --> 02:23:30.070
A dog's obeyed in office.

2984
02:23:30.070 --> 02:23:33.530
Woof, woof, woof!

2985
02:23:33.530 --> 02:23:36.630
Thou rascal beadle, holdthy bloody hand!

2986
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:38.570
Why dost thou lash thatwhore?

2987
02:23:38.570 --> 02:23:41.300
Thou hotly lust'st to useher in that kind

2988
02:23:41.300 --> 02:23:42.900
for which thou whipp'sther.

2989
02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:50.000
The usurer hangs thecozener.

2990
02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:55.230
Through tattered clothes,small vices do appear.

2991
02:23:55.230 --> 02:23:59.230
Robes and furred gownshide all.

2992
02:24:01.530 --> 02:24:04.700
Plate sin with gold,

2993
02:24:04.700 --> 02:24:08.770
and the strong lance ofjustice hurtless breaks.

2994
02:24:08.770 --> 02:24:13.130
Arm it in rags, a pigmy'sstraw does pierce it.

2995
02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:16.700
None does offend, none, Isay, none.

2996
02:24:16.700 --> 02:24:17.900
I'll able 'em.

2997
02:24:17.900 --> 02:24:19.470
Take this of me, myfriend,

2998
02:24:19.470 --> 02:24:23.870
who have the power to sealthe accuser's lips.

2999
02:24:23.870 --> 02:24:28.270
Get thee glass eyes and,like a scurvy politician,

3000
02:24:28.270 --> 02:24:30.900
seem to see the thingsthou dost not.

3001
02:24:30.900 --> 02:24:33.570
Now, now, now, now.

3002
02:24:33.570 --> 02:24:35.770
Pull off my boots.

3003
02:24:35.770 --> 02:24:39.900
Harder, harder.

3004
02:24:42.070 --> 02:24:43.200
So.

3005
02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:45.430
O, matter and impertinencymixed.

3006
02:24:45.430 --> 02:24:47.570
Reason in madness.

3007
02:24:47.570 --> 02:24:51.100
If thou wilt weep myfortune, take my eyes.

3008
02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:54.270
I know thee well enough;thy name is Gloucester.

3009
02:24:54.270 --> 02:24:57.470
Thou must be patient!

3010
02:24:57.470 --> 02:25:00.200
We came crying hither.

3011
02:25:00.200 --> 02:25:02.500
Thou know'st, the firsttime that we smell the air,

3012
02:25:02.500 --> 02:25:04.930
we wawl and cry.

3013
02:25:04.930 --> 02:25:09.130
I will preach to thee.Mark.

3014
02:25:09.130 --> 02:25:11.000
Alack, alack the day.

3015
02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:15.070
When we are born, we crythat we are come

3016
02:25:15.070 --> 02:25:19.700
to this great stage offools.

3017
02:25:24.770 --> 02:25:27.230
This a good block.

3018
02:25:31.630 --> 02:25:35.970
It were a delicatestratagem

3019
02:25:35.970 --> 02:25:42.100
to shoe a troop of horsewith felt.

3020
02:25:43.700 --> 02:25:45.770
I'll put it in proof,

3021
02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:48.300
and when I've stolen uponthese son-in-laws,

3022
02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:50.630
then, kill, kill...

3023
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:52.330
Here he is. Lay a handupon him.

3024
02:25:52.330 --> 02:25:54.130
Sir, your most deardaughter

3025
02:25:54.130 --> 02:25:55.400
No rescue?

3026
02:25:55.400 --> 02:25:57.370
What, a prisoner?

3027
02:25:57.370 --> 02:26:01.000
I am even the natural foolof fortune.

3028
02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:04.500
Use me well; you shallhave ransom.

3029
02:26:09.570 --> 02:26:15.930
Let me have surgeons; I amcut to the brains.

3030
02:26:15.930 --> 02:26:18.100
You shall have anything.

3031
02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:22.570
No seconds?

3032
02:26:22.570 --> 02:26:23.970
All myself?

3033
02:26:23.970 --> 02:26:27.570
Why, this would make a mana man of salt,

3034
02:26:27.570 --> 02:26:30.370
to use his eyes for gardenwater-pots,

3035
02:26:30.370 --> 02:26:32.700
aye, and laying autumn'sdust.

3036
02:26:32.700 --> 02:26:34.770
Good sir.

3037
02:26:34.770 --> 02:26:39.400
I will die bravely, like asmug bridegroom.

3038
02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:41.100
What?

3039
02:26:41.100 --> 02:26:43.170
I will be jovial.

3040
02:26:46.770 --> 02:26:48.200
Come, come.

3041
02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:54.230
I am a king, my masters.

3042
02:26:54.230 --> 02:26:55.270
Know you that?

3043
02:26:55.270 --> 02:26:58.070
You are a royal one, andwe obey you.

3044
02:27:01.700 --> 02:27:05.200
Then there's life in't.

3045
02:27:08.270 --> 02:27:10.570
And you shall get it, youshall get it by running!

3046
02:27:12.030 --> 02:27:14.430
A sight most pitiful inthe meanest wretch,

3047
02:27:14.430 --> 02:27:16.630
past speaking of in aking.

3048
02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:18.330
Hail, gentle sir.

3049
02:27:18.330 --> 02:27:20.300
Sir, speed you. What'syour will?

3050
02:27:20.300 --> 02:27:22.900
Do you know aught, sir, ofa battle toward?

3051
02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:24.700
Most sure and vulgar.

3052
02:27:24.700 --> 02:27:27.130
Everyone hears that, whichcan distinguish sound.

3053
02:27:27.130 --> 02:27:28.970
But, by your favor, hownear's the other army?

3054
02:27:28.970 --> 02:27:30.700
Near and on speedy foot.

3055
02:27:30.700 --> 02:27:33.300
The main descry stands onthe hourly thought.

3056
02:27:33.300 --> 02:27:35.000
I thank you, sir. That'sall.

3057
02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.600
Though that the queen onspecial cause is here,

3058
02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:39.670
her army is moved on.

3059
02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.230
I thank you, sir.

3060
02:27:47.300 --> 02:27:51.630
You ever-gentle gods, takemy breath from me.

3061
02:27:51.630 --> 02:27:54.970
Let not my worser spirittempt me again

3062
02:27:54.970 --> 02:27:56.400
to die before you please.

3063
02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:58.800
Well pray you, father.

3064
02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:04.730
Now, good sir, what areyou?

3065
02:28:04.730 --> 02:28:10.070
A most poor man, made tameto fortune's blows

3066
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:12.770
who, by the art of knownand feeling sorrows,

3067
02:28:12.770 --> 02:28:16.430
am pregnant to good pity.

3068
02:28:16.430 --> 02:28:20.130
Give me your arm; I'lllead you to some biding.

3069
02:28:20.130 --> 02:28:21.700
Hearty thanks.

3070
02:28:21.700 --> 02:28:26.370
The bounty and the benisonof heaven to boot andboot.

3071
02:28:26.370 --> 02:28:28.800
A proclaimed prize.

3072
02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:31.030
Most happy.

3073
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:33.700
That eyeless head of thine

3074
02:28:33.700 --> 02:28:38.200
was first framed flesh toraise my fortunes.

3075
02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:42.630
Thou old unhappy traitor,briefly thyself remember.

3076
02:28:42.630 --> 02:28:45.030
The sword is out that mustdestroy thee.

3077
02:28:45.030 --> 02:28:48.000
O, let thy friendly handput strength enough to't.

3078
02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:49.670
Wherefore, bold peasant,

3079
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:52.970
darest thou support apublished traitor?

3080
02:28:52.970 --> 02:28:58.070
Hence, lest that theinfection of his fortune take

3081
02:28:58.070 --> 02:29:00.300
like hold on thee.

3082
02:29:00.300 --> 02:29:03.270
Let go his arm.

3083
02:29:03.270 --> 02:29:07.770
Let go, slave, or thoudiest.

3084
02:29:09.300 --> 02:29:11.430
Out, dunghill!

3085
02:29:20.700 --> 02:29:25.770
Slave, thou hast slain me.

3086
02:29:25.770 --> 02:29:30.130
Villain, take my purse.

3087
02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:37.130
If ever thou wilt thrive,bury my body.

3088
02:29:38.830 --> 02:29:44.430
And take the letters whichthou find'st about me

3089
02:29:44.430 --> 02:29:48.870
to Edmund, Earl ofGloucester.

3090
02:29:50.930 --> 02:29:55.670
Seek him out upon theEnglish party.

3091
02:29:57.830 --> 02:30:01.270
O, untimely death.

3092
02:30:04.500 --> 02:30:06.770
Death.

3093
02:30:06.770 --> 02:30:12.200
I know thee well: aserviceable villain,

3094
02:30:12.200 --> 02:30:14.870
as duteous to the vices ofthy mistress

3095
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:16.670
as badness would desire.

3096
02:30:16.670 --> 02:30:21.170
What, is he dead?

3097
02:30:21.170 --> 02:30:22.870
Let's see; the letter thathe speaks of

3098
02:30:22.870 --> 02:30:25.570
may be my friend.

3099
02:30:25.570 --> 02:30:27.970
Leave, gentle wax.

3100
02:30:27.970 --> 02:30:30.930
And, manners, blame usnot.

3101
02:30:30.930 --> 02:30:33.070
To know our enemies'minds, we'd rip theirhearts.

3102
02:30:33.070 --> 02:30:36.270
Their papers is mostlawful.

3103
02:30:36.270 --> 02:30:39.000
"Let our reciprocal vowsberemembered.

3104
02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.500
"You have many opportunitiesto cut him off.

"If your will want not,

02:30:43.170 --> 02:30:45.930
"time and place will befruitfully offered.

"There is nothing done ifhe return the conqueror.

"Then am I the prisonerand his bed my jail,

"Your wife so I would say

Affectionate servant,Goneril."

3113
02:31:00.970 --> 02:31:05.870
O indistinguished space ofwoman's will.

3114
02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:08.730
A plot upon her virtuoushusband's life

3115
02:31:08.730 --> 02:31:11.130
and the exchange mybrother.

3116
02:31:24.130 --> 02:31:26.400
The king is mad.

3117
02:31:26.400 --> 02:31:29.670
How stiff is my vilesense, that I stand up

3118
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:33.600
and have ingeniousfeelings of my hugesorrows.

3119
02:31:33.600 --> 02:31:35.400
Better I were distract.

3120
02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:39.030
So should my thoughts besevered from my griefs

3121
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:41.800
and woes by wrongimaginations

3122
02:31:41.800 --> 02:31:44.370
lose the knowledge ofthemselves.

3123
02:31:46.100 --> 02:31:48.130
Give me your hand.

3124
02:31:48.130 --> 02:31:51.930
Far off, methinks, I hearthe beaten drum.

3125
02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:57.930
Come, father; I'll bestowyou with a friend.

3126
02:32:03.500 --> 02:32:05.570
O thou good Kent,

3127
02:32:05.570 --> 02:32:09.470
how shall I live and workto match thy goodness?

3128
02:32:09.470 --> 02:32:12.870
My life will be too shortand every measure fail me.

3129
02:32:12.870 --> 02:32:14.870
To be acknowledged, madam,is o'erpaid.

3130
02:32:14.870 --> 02:32:17.570
All my reports go with themodest truth

3131
02:32:17.570 --> 02:32:20.430
nor more nor clipped, butso.

3132
02:32:20.430 --> 02:32:22.200
Be better suited.

3133
02:32:22.200 --> 02:32:24.630
These weeds are memoriesof those worser hours.

3134
02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:25.730
I prithee, put them off.

3135
02:32:25.730 --> 02:32:26.770
Pardon, dear madam.

3136
02:32:26.770 --> 02:32:28.800
Yet to be known shortensmy made intent.

3137
02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:30.900
My boon I make it that youknow me not

3138
02:32:30.900 --> 02:32:32.730
till time and I thinkmeet.

3139
02:32:32.730 --> 02:32:35.770
Then be it so, my goodlord.

3140
02:32:35.770 --> 02:32:37.630
How does the king?

3141
02:32:37.630 --> 02:32:39.470
Madam, sleeps still.

3142
02:32:39.470 --> 02:32:41.200
O you kind gods,

3143
02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:44.070

3144
02:32:44.070 --> 02:32:46.100
The untuned and jarringsenses,

3145
02:32:46.100 --> 02:32:48.970
O, wind up of thischild-changed father.

3146
02:32:48.970 --> 02:32:51.230
So please Your Majestythat we may wake the king.

3147
02:32:51.230 --> 02:32:52.470
He hath slept long.

3148
02:32:52.470 --> 02:32:54.200
Be governed by yourknowledge,

3149
02:32:54.200 --> 02:32:56.030
and proceed in the sway ofyour own will.

3150
02:32:56.030 --> 02:32:57.570
Is he arrayed?

3151
02:32:57.570 --> 02:32:59.170
Aye, madam; in theheaviness of his sleep,

3152
02:32:59.170 --> 02:33:00.970
we put fresh garments onhim.

3153

Be by, good madam, when wedo awake him.

3154
02:33:03.030 --> 02:33:04.830
I doubt not of histemperance.

3155
02:33:04.830 --> 02:33:07.030
Very well.

3156
02:33:07.030 --> 02:33:09.030
Please you, draw near.

3157
02:33:20.430 --> 02:33:22.870
O my dear father.

3158
02:33:25.430 --> 02:33:28.300
Restoration, hang thymedicine on my lips,

3159
02:33:28.300 --> 02:33:32.100
and let this kiss repairthose violent harms

3160
02:33:32.100 --> 02:33:36.900
that my two sisters havein thy reverence made.

3161
02:33:36.900 --> 02:33:38.930
Kind and dear princess.

3162
02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:47.900
Had you not been theirfather,

3163
02:33:47.900 --> 02:33:51.300
these white flakes didchallenge pity of them.

3164
02:33:51.300 --> 02:33:55.770
Was this a face to beopposed against thewarring winds?

3165
02:33:55.770 --> 02:33:57.970
Mine enemy's dog, thoughhe had bit me,

3166
02:33:57.970 --> 02:34:00.930
should have stood thatnight against my fire.

3167
02:34:00.930 --> 02:34:06.030
And wast thou fain, poorfather, to hovel thee

3168
02:34:06.030 --> 02:34:11.400
with swine and roguesforlorn in short and mustystraw?

3169
02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:12.630
Alack, alack.

3170
02:34:12.630 --> 02:34:14.230
'Tis wonder that thy lifeand wits at once

3171
02:34:14.230 --> 02:34:17.400
had not concluded all.

3172
02:34:19.730 --> 02:34:22.200
He wakes. Speak to him.

3173
02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:27.370
Madam, do you. 'Tisfittest.

3174
02:34:29.470 --> 02:34:32.700
How does my royal lord?

3175
02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:38.270
How fares Your Majesty?

3176
02:34:44.630 --> 02:34:51.070
You do me wrong to take meout o' the grave.

3177
02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:59.100
Thou art a soul in bliss,

3178
02:34:59.100 --> 02:35:02.730
but I am bound upon awheel of fire

3179
02:35:02.730 --> 02:35:09.900
which mine own tears doscald like molten lead.

3180
02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:17.330
Sir, do you know me?

3181
02:35:20.670 --> 02:35:24.800
You are a spirit, I know.

3182
02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:29.070
Where did you die?

3183
02:35:29.070 --> 02:35:31.070
Still, still, far wide.

3184
02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:34.070
He's scarce awake; let himalone awhile.

3185
02:35:41.270 --> 02:35:44.930
Where have I been?

3186
02:35:44.930 --> 02:35:47.670
Where am I?

3187
02:35:49.370 --> 02:35:52.570
Fair daylight?

3188
02:35:52.570 --> 02:35:56.500
I am mightily abused.

3189
02:35:56.500 --> 02:36:02.470
I would e'en die with pityto see another thus.

3190
02:36:07.070 --> 02:36:09.630
I know not what to say.

3191
02:36:12.870 --> 02:36:17.900
I will not swear these aremy hands.

3192
02:36:20.430 --> 02:36:21.970
Let's see.

3193
02:36:24.230 --> 02:36:27.570
I feel this pinprick.

3194
02:36:27.570 --> 02:36:32.430
Would I were assured of mycondition.

3195
02:36:32.430 --> 02:36:34.830
O, look upon me, sir,

3196
02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:39.670
and hold your hands inbenediction o'er me.

3197
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:49.570
No, sir, you must notkneel.

3198
02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:54.470
Pray, do not mock me.

3199
02:36:54.470 --> 02:36:58.230
I am a very foolish, fondold man,

3200
02:36:58.230 --> 02:37:06.970
fourscore and upward, notan hour more nor less.

3201
02:37:06.970 --> 02:37:15.530
And, to deal plainly, Ifear I am not in myperfect mind.

3202
02:37:18.970 --> 02:37:27.670
Methinks I should know youand know this man.

3203
02:37:30.570 --> 02:37:35.100
Yet I am doubtful,

3204
02:37:35.100 --> 02:37:39.270
for I am mainly ignorantwhat place this is.

3205
02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:47.500
All my skill remembers notthese garments.

3206
02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:52.470
Nor I know not where I didlodge last night.

3207
02:37:58.270 --> 02:38:07.330
Do not laugh at me, for asI am a man,

3208
02:38:07.330 --> 02:38:13.630
I think this lady to be mychild Cordelia.

3209
02:38:13.630 --> 02:38:18.230
So I am. I am.

3210
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:21.600
Be thy tears wet?

3211
02:38:25.270 --> 02:38:28.370
Yes, 'faith.

3212
02:38:29.670 --> 02:38:33.200
If you have poison for me,I will drink it.

3213
02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:39.200
I know you do not love me,for your sisters have,

3214
02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:43.700
as I remember, done mewrong.

3215
02:38:43.700 --> 02:38:48.500
You have some cause; theyhave not.

3216
02:38:48.500 --> 02:38:51.130
No cause.

3217
02:38:51.130 --> 02:38:54.570
Am I in France?

3218
02:38:54.570 --> 02:38:56.500
In your own kingdom, sir.

3219
02:38:56.500 --> 02:38:58.870
Do not abuse me.

3220
02:38:58.870 --> 02:39:00.770
Be comforted, good madam.

3221
02:39:00.770 --> 02:39:03.430
The great rage, you see,is killed in him,

3222
02:39:03.430 --> 02:39:04.700
and yet it is danger

3223
02:39:04.700 --> 02:39:07.470
to make him even o'er thetime he has lost.

3224
02:39:09.870 --> 02:39:13.770
Will it please yourhighness walk?

3225
02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:28.270
You must bear with me.

3226
02:39:28.270 --> 02:39:34.470
Pray you now, forget andforgive.

3227
02:39:34.470 --> 02:39:38.030
I am old and foolish.

3228
02:39:42.730 --> 02:39:44.130
Holds it true, sir,

3229
02:39:44.130 --> 02:39:46.200
that the Duke of Cornwallwas so slain?

3230
02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:48.700
Most certain, sir.

3231
02:39:48.700 --> 02:39:51.100
Who is the conductor ofhis people?

3232
02:39:51.100 --> 02:39:54.900
As 'tis said, the bastardson of Gloucester.

3233
02:39:54.900 --> 02:39:56.630
They say Edgar, hisbanished son,

3234
02:39:56.630 --> 02:39:59.070
is with the Earl of Kentin Germany.

3235
02:39:59.070 --> 02:40:01.230
Report is changeable.

3236
02:40:01.230 --> 02:40:03.330
'Tis time to look about.

3237
02:40:03.330 --> 02:40:05.070
The powers of the kingdomapproach apace.

3238
02:40:05.070 --> 02:40:06.700
The arbitrament is like tobe bloody.

3239
02:40:06.700 --> 02:40:08.370
Fare you well, sir.

3240
02:40:10.770 --> 02:40:13.330
My point and period willbe truly wrought,

3241
02:40:13.330 --> 02:40:19.170
or well or ill, as thisday's battle's fought.

3242
02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:35.570
Now, sweet lord,

3243
02:40:35.570 --> 02:40:39.170
you know the goodness Iintend upon you.

3244
02:40:39.170 --> 02:40:44.700
Tell me but truly but thenspeak the truth,

3245
02:40:44.700 --> 02:40:47.830
do you not love my sister?

3246
02:40:47.830 --> 02:40:51.300
In honored love.

3247
02:40:51.300 --> 02:40:53.370
But have you never foundmy brother's way

3248
02:40:53.370 --> 02:40:54.700
to the forfended place?

3249
02:40:54.700 --> 02:40:56.830
No, by mine honor, madam.

3250
02:40:56.830 --> 02:40:59.230
I never shall endure her.

3251
02:40:59.230 --> 02:41:02.430
Dear my lord, be notfamiliar with her.

3252
02:41:02.430 --> 02:41:03.570
Fear me not.

3253
02:41:03.570 --> 02:41:06.600
She and the duke, herhusband

3254
02:41:06.600 --> 02:41:08.530
I had rather lose thebattle

3255
02:41:08.530 --> 02:41:11.530
than that sister shouldloosen him and me.

3256
02:41:11.530 --> 02:41:13.630
Our very loving sister,well be-met.

3257
02:41:13.630 --> 02:41:16.630
Sir, this I heard: theking is come to hisdaughter,

3258
02:41:16.630 --> 02:41:20.430
with others whom the rigorof our state forced to cryout.

3259
02:41:20.430 --> 02:41:23.730
Where I could not behonest, I never yet wasvaliant, for

3260
02:41:23.730 --> 02:41:25.200
Why is this reasoned?

3261
02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:27.170
Combine together 'gainstthe enemy,

3262
02:41:27.170 --> 02:41:30.570
for these domesticparticulars are not thequestion here.

3263
02:41:30.570 --> 02:41:31.730
Let's then determine

3264
02:41:31.730 --> 02:41:34.000
with the ancient of war onour proceeding.

3265
02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:37.930
Sister, you'll go with us?

3266
02:41:37.930 --> 02:41:39.170
No.

3267
02:41:39.170 --> 02:41:41.800
'Tis most convenient; Ipray you, go with us.

3268
02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:46.100
O, ho, I know the riddle.

3269
02:41:46.100 --> 02:41:48.570
I will go.

3270
02:41:55.100 --> 02:41:57.770
If e'er your grace hadspeech with man so poor,

3271
02:41:57.770 --> 02:41:59.430
hear me one word.

3272
02:41:59.430 --> 02:42:02.570
I'll overtake you! Speak.

3273
02:42:02.570 --> 02:42:04.530
Before you fight thebattle, ope this letter.

3274
02:42:04.530 --> 02:42:05.800
If you have victory,

3275
02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:08.200
let the trumpet sound forhim that brought it.

3276
02:42:08.200 --> 02:42:10.770
Wretched though I seem, Ican produce a champion

3277
02:42:10.770 --> 02:42:13.330
that will prove what isavouched there.

3278
02:42:13.330 --> 02:42:16.300
If you miscarry, yourbusiness of the world hathso an end,

3279
02:42:16.300 --> 02:42:18.470
and machination ceases.

3280
02:42:18.470 --> 02:42:19.700
Fortune love you.

3281
02:42:19.700 --> 02:42:21.070
Stay till I have read theletter.

3282
02:42:21.070 --> 02:42:22.500
I was forbid it.

3283
02:42:22.500 --> 02:42:25.300
When time shall serve, letbut the herald cry,

3284
02:42:25.300 --> 02:42:28.670
and I'll appear again.

3285
02:42:28.670 --> 02:42:29.800
Why, fare thee well.

3286
02:42:29.800 --> 02:42:34.070
I will o'erlook yourpaper.

3287
02:42:34.070 --> 02:42:36.300
The enemy's in view; drawup your powers.

3288
02:42:36.300 --> 02:42:39.500
Here is the guess of theirtrue strength and forces

3289
02:42:39.500 --> 02:42:41.000
by diligent discovery.

3290
02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.800
But your haste is nowurged on you.

3291
02:42:45.930 --> 02:42:47.930
We will greet the time.

3292
02:42:51.930 --> 02:42:56.170
To both these sisters haveI sworn my love,

3293
02:42:56.170 --> 02:43:00.530
each jealous of the otheras the stung are of theadder.

3294
02:43:00.530 --> 02:43:02.130
Which of them shall Itake?

3295
02:43:02.130 --> 02:43:04.770
Both? One?

3296
02:43:04.770 --> 02:43:06.830
Or neither?

3297
02:43:06.830 --> 02:43:10.600
Neither can be enjoyed ifboth remain alive.

3298
02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:13.570
To take the widowexasperates, makes mad hersister Goneril.

3299
02:43:13.570 --> 02:43:15.470
And hardly shall I carryout my side,

3300
02:43:15.470 --> 02:43:17.870
her husband being alive.

3301
02:43:17.870 --> 02:43:23.300
Now, then, we'll use hiscountenance for thebattle,

3302
02:43:23.300 --> 02:43:27.100
which, being done, let herwho would be rid of him

3303
02:43:27.100 --> 02:43:30.100
devise his speedy takingoff.

3304
02:43:30.100 --> 02:43:31.430
As for the mercy which heintends

3305
02:43:31.430 --> 02:43:32.570
to Lear and to Cordelia,

3306
02:43:32.570 --> 02:43:34.670
the battle done and theywithin our power

3307
02:43:34.670 --> 02:43:36.100
shall never see hispardon,

3308
02:43:36.100 --> 02:43:40.230
for my state stands on meto defend, not to debate.

3309
02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:54.270
Away, old man. Give me thyhand, away.

3310
02:43:54.270 --> 02:43:57.000
King Lear hath lost, heand his daughter ta'en.

3311
02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:58.800
Give me thy hand; come on.

3312
02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:00.470
No further, sir.

3313
02:44:00.470 --> 02:44:03.000
A man may rot even here.

3314
02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:06.670
What, in ill thoughtsagain?

3315
02:44:06.670 --> 02:44:08.830
Men must endure theirgoing hence

3316
02:44:08.830 --> 02:44:10.830
even as their cominghither.

3317
02:44:10.830 --> 02:44:14.270
Ripeness is all.

3318
02:44:14.270 --> 02:44:15.800
Come on.

3319
02:44:15.800 --> 02:44:18.800
And that's true too.

3320
02:44:20.670 --> 02:44:23.300
Some officers, take themaway.

3321
02:44:23.300 --> 02:44:25.470
Good guard until theirgreater pleasures

3322
02:44:25.470 --> 02:44:27.830
first be known that are tocensure them.

3323
02:44:27.830 --> 02:44:30.130
We are not the first who,with best meaning,

3324
02:44:30.130 --> 02:44:31.970
have incurred the worst.

3325
02:44:31.970 --> 02:44:36.000
For thee, oppressed king,am I cast down.

3326
02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:40.570
Myself could else outfrownfalse fortune's frown.

3327
02:44:40.570 --> 02:44:44.100
Shall we not see thesedaughters and thesesisters?

3328
02:44:44.100 --> 02:44:46.700
No, no, no, no!

3329
02:44:46.700 --> 02:44:49.730
Come, let's away toprison.

3330
02:44:49.730 --> 02:44:54.130
We two alone will singlike birds i' the cage.

3331
02:44:54.130 --> 02:44:57.300
When thou dost ask meblessing, I'll kneel down,

3332
02:44:57.300 --> 02:44:58.970
and ask of theeforgiveness.

3333
02:44:58.970 --> 02:45:03.230
So we'll live and pray andsing and tell old tales,

3334
02:45:03.230 --> 02:45:07.370
and laugh at gildedbutterflies

3335
02:45:07.370 --> 02:45:10.170
and hear poor rogues talkof court news.

3336
02:45:10.170 --> 02:45:13.470
And we'll talk with themtoo, who loses and whowins,

3337
02:45:13.470 --> 02:45:15.230
who's in, who's out,

3338
02:45:15.230 --> 02:45:17.570
and take upon's themystery of things,

3339
02:45:17.570 --> 02:45:20.300
as if we were God's spies.

3340
02:45:20.300 --> 02:45:23.430
And we'll wear out, in awalled prison,

3341
02:45:23.430 --> 02:45:27.430
packs and sects of thegreat ones that ebb andflow by the moon.

3342
02:45:27.430 --> 02:45:28.930
Take them away.

3343
02:45:28.930 --> 02:45:30.800
Upon such sacrifices, myCordelia,

3344
02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:34.470
the gods themselves throwincense.

3345
02:45:34.470 --> 02:45:37.470
Have I caught thee?

3346
02:45:37.470 --> 02:45:42.630
He that parts us shallbring a brand from heaven

3347
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:47.000
and fire us hence likefoxes.

3348
02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.330
Wipe thine eyes.

3349
02:45:49.330 --> 02:45:51.730
The good-years shalldevour them,

3350
02:45:51.730 --> 02:45:54.470
flesh and fell, ere theyshall make us weep.

3351
02:45:54.470 --> 02:45:58.170
We'll see 'em starvefirst.

3352
02:46:00.230 --> 02:46:02.730
Come.

3353
02:46:02.730 --> 02:46:06.730
Come hither, Captain.Hark.

3354
02:46:06.730 --> 02:46:08.100
Take thou this note.

3355
02:46:08.100 --> 02:46:09.100
Go follow them to prison.

3356
02:46:09.100 --> 02:46:11.070
One step, I have advancedthee.

3357
02:46:11.070 --> 02:46:12.630
If thou dost as thisinstructs thee,

3358
02:46:12.630 --> 02:46:15.200
thou dost make thy way tonoble fortunes.

3359
02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:17.770
Know thou this: that menare as the time is.

3360
02:46:17.770 --> 02:46:20.070
To be tender-minded doesnot become a sword.

3361
02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:22.470
Thy great employment willnot bear question.

3362
02:46:22.470 --> 02:46:24.470
Either say thou'lt do 't,or thrive by other means.

3363
02:46:24.470 --> 02:46:25.700
I'll do it, my lord.

3364
02:46:25.700 --> 02:46:27.500
About it, and write happywhen thou hast done.

3365
02:46:27.500 --> 02:46:28.730
Mark, I say, instantly,

3366
02:46:28.730 --> 02:46:30.700
and carry it so as I haveset it down.

3367
02:46:30.700 --> 02:46:33.070
I cannot draw a cart noreat dried oats.

3368
02:46:33.070 --> 02:46:35.970
If it be man's work, I'lldo it.

3369
02:46:38.300 --> 02:46:42.300
Sir, you have shown todayyour valiant strain,

3370
02:46:42.300 --> 02:46:43.870
and fortune led you well.

3371
02:46:43.870 --> 02:46:45.530
You have the captives

3372
02:46:45.530 --> 02:46:47.300
who were the opposites ofthis day's strife.

3373
02:46:47.300 --> 02:46:48.870
I do require them of you,so to use them

3374
02:46:48.870 --> 02:46:50.530
as we shall find theirmerits and our safety

3375
02:46:50.530 --> 02:46:51.970
may equally determine.

3376
02:46:51.970 --> 02:46:55.530
Sir, I thought it fit tosend the old and miserableking

3377
02:46:55.530 --> 02:46:58.130
to some retention andappointed guard,

3378
02:46:58.130 --> 02:47:00.830
whose age had charms init, whose title more,

3379
02:47:00.830 --> 02:47:02.770
to pluck the common bosomon his side

3380
02:47:02.770 --> 02:47:05.070
an turn our impressedlances in our eyes

3381
02:47:05.070 --> 02:47:06.400
which do command them.

3382
02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:09.000
With him I sent the queen,my reason all the same.

3383
02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.300
And they are readytomorrow, or at furtherspace,

3384
02:47:11.300 --> 02:47:13.630
to appear where you shallhold your session.

3385
02:47:13.630 --> 02:47:15.530
Sir, by your patience, Ihold you

3386
02:47:15.530 --> 02:47:18.430
but a subject of this war,not as a brother.

3387
02:47:18.430 --> 02:47:20.270
That's as we list to gracehim.

3388
02:47:20.270 --> 02:47:22.730
Methinks our pleasuremight have been demanded,

3389
02:47:22.730 --> 02:47:24.330
'ere you spoke so far.

3390
02:47:24.330 --> 02:47:26.730
He hath led our powers,

3391
02:47:26.730 --> 02:47:30.000
bore the commission of myplace and person,

3392
02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:31.500
the which immediacy maywell stand up

3393
02:47:31.500 --> 02:47:33.170
and call itself yourbrother.

3394
02:47:33.170 --> 02:47:34.300
Not so hot.

3395
02:47:34.300 --> 02:47:36.300
In his own grace, he dothexalt himself

3396
02:47:36.300 --> 02:47:37.970
more than in youraddition.

3397
02:47:37.970 --> 02:47:41.000
In my rights, by meinvested, he compeers thebest.

3398
02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.730
That were the most if heshould husband you.

3399
02:47:43.730 --> 02:47:46.100
Jesters do oft proveprophets.

3400
02:47:46.100 --> 02:47:47.430
Holla, holla!

3401
02:47:47.430 --> 02:47:49.230
That eye that told you solooked but a-squint.

3402
02:47:49.230 --> 02:47:51.500
Lady, I am not well,

3403
02:47:51.500 --> 02:47:54.270
else't I should answerfrom a full-flowingstomach.

3404
02:47:54.270 --> 02:47:58.670
General, take thou mysoldiers, prisoners,patrimony.

3405
02:47:58.670 --> 02:48:00.670
Dispose of them, of me.

3406
02:48:00.670 --> 02:48:02.200
The walls is thine.

3407
02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:03.400
Witness the world

3408
02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:06.230
that I create thee here mylord and master.

3409
02:48:06.230 --> 02:48:07.400
Mean you to enjoy him?

3410
02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:09.270
The let-alone lies not inyour good will.

3411
02:48:09.270 --> 02:48:10.830
Nor in thine, lord.

3412
02:48:10.830 --> 02:48:12.930
Half-blooded fellow, yes.

3413
02:48:12.930 --> 02:48:15.900
Let the drum strike andprove my title thine.

3414
02:48:15.900 --> 02:48:17.470
Stay yet; hear reason.

3415
02:48:17.470 --> 02:48:20.430
Edmund, I arrest thee oncapital treason

3416
02:48:20.430 --> 02:48:22.730
and, in thy attaint, thisgilded serpent.

3417
02:48:22.730 --> 02:48:25.170
For your claim, fairsister,

3418
02:48:25.170 --> 02:48:27.030
I bar it in the interestof my wife.

3419
02:48:27.030 --> 02:48:29.970
'Tis she is subcontractedto this lord,

3420
02:48:29.970 --> 02:48:33.170
and I, her husband,contradict your bans.

3421
02:48:33.170 --> 02:48:34.730
If you would marry, makeyour love to me;

3422
02:48:34.730 --> 02:48:36.800
my lady is bespoke.

3423
02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:38.170
An interlude!

3424
02:48:38.170 --> 02:48:39.300
Thou art armed,Gloucester.

3425
02:48:39.300 --> 02:48:41.370
Let the trumpet sound.

3426
02:48:41.370 --> 02:48:43.570
If none appear to proveupon thy person

3427
02:48:43.570 --> 02:48:46.070
thy heinous, manifest, andmany treasons,

3428
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:49.000
there is my pledge:

3429
02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.070
I'll make it on thy heart'ere I taste bread,

3430
02:48:51.070 --> 02:48:54.200
thou art in nothing lessthan I have hereproclaimed thee.

3431
02:48:54.200 --> 02:48:58.100
Sick, O, sick!

3432
02:48:58.100 --> 02:49:00.400
If not, I'll ne'er trustmedicine.

3433
02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:03.070
There's my exchange.

3434
02:49:03.070 --> 02:49:06.730
What in the world he isthat names me traitor,

3435
02:49:06.730 --> 02:49:08.570
villain-like, he lies.

3436
02:49:08.570 --> 02:49:10.130
Call by thy trumpet.

3437
02:49:10.130 --> 02:49:13.330
He that dares approach onhim, on you, who not

3438
02:49:13.330 --> 02:49:16.000
I will maintain my truthand honor firmly.

3439
02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.800
A herald, ho!

3440
02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:22.130
Trust to thy singlevirtue,

3441
02:49:22.130 --> 02:49:24.830
for thy soldiers, alllevied in my name,

3442
02:49:24.830 --> 02:49:29.270
have, in my name, tooktheir discharge.

3443
02:49:29.270 --> 02:49:31.970
My sickness grows upon me.

3444
02:49:31.970 --> 02:49:37.100
She is not well; conveyher to my tent.

3445
02:49:44.930 --> 02:49:46.530
Come hither, herald.

3446
02:49:46.530 --> 02:49:50.230
Let the trumpet sound, andread out this.

3447
02:49:57.030 --> 02:50:02.870
"If any man of quality ordegree within the lists ofthe army

3448
02:50:02.870 --> 02:50:07.300
"will maintain uponEdmund, supposed Earl ofGloucester,

3449
02:50:07.300 --> 02:50:10.400
"that he is a manifoldtraitor,

3450
02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:14.870
"let him appear by thethird sound of thetrumpet.

3451
02:50:14.870 --> 02:50:18.730
He is bold in hisdefense."

3452
02:50:20.630 --> 02:50:22.930
Sound!

3453
02:50:27.230 --> 02:50:28.770
Again!

3454
02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:34.170
Again!

3455
02:50:44.300 --> 02:50:46.570
Ask him his purposes

3456
02:50:46.570 --> 02:50:49.300
and why he appears uponthis call o' the trumpet.

3457
02:50:49.300 --> 02:50:51.370
What are you:

3458
02:50:51.370 --> 02:50:53.970
your name, your quality,

3459
02:50:53.970 --> 02:50:58.230
and why you answer thispresent summons?

3460
02:50:58.230 --> 02:51:01.700
Know, my name is lost,

3461
02:51:01.700 --> 02:51:06.500
by treason's toothbare-gnawn and canker-bit.

3462
02:51:06.500 --> 02:51:10.130
Yet am I noble as theadversary I come to cope.

3463
02:51:10.130 --> 02:51:12.570
Which is that adversary?

3464
02:51:12.570 --> 02:51:16.470
What's he that speaks forEdmund, Earl ofGloucester?

3465
02:51:16.470 --> 02:51:19.370
Himself. What say'st thouto him?

3466
02:51:23.800 --> 02:51:28.270
Draw thy sword that, if myspeech offend a nobleheart,

3467
02:51:28.270 --> 02:51:30.970
thy arm may do theejustice.

3468
02:51:30.970 --> 02:51:33.970
Here is mine.

3469
02:51:33.970 --> 02:51:35.770
Behold, it is theprivilege

3470
02:51:35.770 --> 02:51:39.000
of mine honors, my oath,and my profession.

3471
02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:45.500
I protest, maugre thystrength, youth, place,and eminence

3472
02:51:45.500 --> 02:51:48.930
despite thy victor swordand fire-new fortune,

3473
02:51:48.930 --> 02:51:53.870
thy valor and thy heart,thou art a traitor,

3474
02:51:53.870 --> 02:51:57.600
false to thy gods, thybrother, and thy father;

3475
02:51:57.600 --> 02:52:01.130
conspirant 'gainst thishigh-illustrious prince;

3476
02:52:01.130 --> 02:52:03.470
and, from the extremistupward of thy head

3477
02:52:03.470 --> 02:52:06.630
to the descent and dustbelow thy foot,

3478
02:52:06.630 --> 02:52:09.370
a most toad-spottedtraitor.

3479
02:52:09.370 --> 02:52:12.830
Say thou "no,"

3480
02:52:12.830 --> 02:52:15.100
this sword, this arm, andmy best spirits

3481
02:52:15.100 --> 02:52:16.900
are bent to prove upon thyheart,

3482
02:52:16.900 --> 02:52:20.700
whereto I speak, thouliest.

3483
02:52:23.500 --> 02:52:26.570
In wisdom, I should askthy name.

3484
02:52:26.570 --> 02:52:31.130
But since thy outsidelooks so fair and warlike

3485
02:52:31.130 --> 02:52:33.730
and that thy tongue somesay of breeding breathes,

3486
02:52:33.730 --> 02:52:36.400
what safe and nicely Imight well delay

3487
02:52:36.400 --> 02:52:39.600
by rule of knighthood, Idisdain and spurn.

3488
02:52:42.470 --> 02:52:45.530
Back do I toss thesetreasons to thy head

3489
02:52:45.530 --> 02:52:48.370
with the hell-hated lieo'erwhelm thy heart;

3490
02:52:48.370 --> 02:52:51.230
which, for they yet glanceby and scarcely bruise,

3491
02:52:51.230 --> 02:52:54.030
this sword of mine shallgive them instant way,

3492
02:52:54.030 --> 02:52:56.530
where they shall restforever.

3493
02:52:58.130 --> 02:53:00.430
Trumpets, speak.

3494
02:53:35.470 --> 02:53:38.200
Save him. Save him!

3495
02:53:41.230 --> 02:53:43.000
This is practice,Gloucester.

3496
02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:44.700
By the laws of war, thouwast not bound

3497
02:53:44.700 --> 02:53:47.270
to answer an unknownopposite.

3498
02:53:47.270 --> 02:53:50.830
Thou art not vanquishedbut cozened and beguiled.

3499
02:53:50.830 --> 02:53:53.130
Shut your mouth, dame.

3500
02:53:55.270 --> 02:53:56.930
Or with this paper shall Istop it.

3501
02:53:56.930 --> 02:53:58.270
Hold, sir.

3502
02:53:58.270 --> 02:54:00.700
Thou worse than any name,read thine own evil.

3503
02:54:00.700 --> 02:54:02.430
No tearing, lady.

3504
02:54:02.430 --> 02:54:03.730
I perceive you know it.

3505
02:54:03.730 --> 02:54:06.130
Say, if I do, the laws aremine, not thine.

3506
02:54:06.130 --> 02:54:07.330
Who can arraign me for it?

3507
02:54:07.330 --> 02:54:08.400
Most monstrous.

3508
02:54:08.400 --> 02:54:10.300
Oh, know'st thou thispaper?

3509
02:54:10.300 --> 02:54:14.570
Ask me not what I know.

3510
02:54:14.570 --> 02:54:18.070
Go after her. She'sdesperate; govern her.

3511
02:54:20.770 --> 02:54:24.930
What you have charged mewith, that have I done,

3512
02:54:24.930 --> 02:54:28.600
and more, much more.

3513
02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:30.400
The time will bring itout.

3514
02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:32.600
'Tis past, and so am I.

3515
02:54:32.600 --> 02:54:36.300
But what art thou thathast this fortune on me?

3516
02:54:36.300 --> 02:54:38.200
If thou art noble, I doforgive thee.

3517
02:54:39.930 --> 02:54:43.730
I am no less in blood thanthou art, Edmund.

3518
02:54:43.730 --> 02:54:47.430
If more, the more thouhast wronged me.

3519
02:54:47.430 --> 02:54:53.800
My name is Edgar and thyfather's son.

3520
02:54:53.800 --> 02:54:55.230
The gods are just

3521
02:54:55.230 --> 02:54:57.530
and, of our pleasantvices, make instruments toplague us.

3522
02:54:57.530 --> 02:54:59.230
The dark and vicious placewhere thee he got

3523
02:54:59.230 --> 02:55:00.930
cost him his eyes.

3524
02:55:00.930 --> 02:55:04.670
Thou hast spoken right;'tis true.

3525
02:55:04.670 --> 02:55:07.330
The wheel is come fullcircle.

3526
02:55:07.330 --> 02:55:08.870
I am here.

3527
02:55:08.870 --> 02:55:11.470
Methought thy very gaitdid prophesy a royalnobleness.

3528
02:55:11.470 --> 02:55:12.700
I must embrace thee.

3529
02:55:12.700 --> 02:55:14.430
Let sorrow split my heart

3530
02:55:14.430 --> 02:55:17.070
if ever I did hate thee orthy father.

3531
02:55:17.070 --> 02:55:18.300
Worthy prince, I know it.

3532
02:55:18.300 --> 02:55:19.700
Where have you hidyourself?

3533
02:55:19.700 --> 02:55:21.500
How have you known themiseries of your father?

3534
02:55:21.500 --> 02:55:23.270
By nursing them, my lord.

3535
02:55:23.270 --> 02:55:26.800
List a brief tale, andwhen 'tis told,

3536
02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:30.070
O, that my heart wouldburst.

3537
02:55:30.070 --> 02:55:33.330
The bloody proclamation toescape

3538
02:55:33.330 --> 02:55:36.270
that followed me so near

3539
02:55:36.270 --> 02:55:37.670
O, our lives' sweetness.

3540
02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:39.270
That we the pain of deathhourly would die

3541
02:55:39.270 --> 02:55:41.170
rather than die at once

3542
02:55:41.170 --> 02:55:46.270
led me to move into amadman's rags,

3543
02:55:46.270 --> 02:55:49.130
to assume a semblance thatvery dogs disdained.

3544
02:55:49.130 --> 02:55:52.500
And in this habit met I myfather

3545
02:55:52.500 --> 02:55:56.500
with his bleeding ringstheir precious stones newlost.

3546
02:55:56.500 --> 02:55:59.470
Became his guide, led him,begged for him,

3547
02:55:59.470 --> 02:56:01.330
saved him from despair.

3548
02:56:01.330 --> 02:56:05.570
Never fault! revealedmyself unto him

3549
02:56:05.570 --> 02:56:09.200
until some half-hour past,when I was armed.

3550
02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:12.830
Not sure, though hoping,of this good success,

3551
02:56:12.830 --> 02:56:18.700
I asked his blessing andtold him all mypilgrimage.

3552
02:56:20.530 --> 02:56:24.100
But his flawed heart,alack,

3553
02:56:24.100 --> 02:56:26.070
too weak the conflict tosupport,

3554
02:56:26.070 --> 02:56:35.930
'twixt two extremes ofpassion, joy and grief,burst smilingly.

3555
02:56:35.930 --> 02:56:39.430
Help, help, oh, help!

3556
02:56:39.430 --> 02:56:41.170
What kind of help? Speak,man.

3557
02:56:41.170 --> 02:56:42.370
What means this bloodyknife?

3558
02:56:42.370 --> 02:56:45.370
'Tis hot; it smokes.

3559
02:56:45.370 --> 02:56:48.170
It came even from theheart of

3560
02:56:48.170 --> 02:56:49.700
she's dead!

3561
02:56:49.700 --> 02:56:51.630
Who dead? Speak, man.

3562
02:56:51.630 --> 02:56:54.530
Your lady, sir, your lady.

3563
02:56:54.530 --> 02:56:55.930
And her sister by her ispoisoned.

3564
02:56:55.930 --> 02:56:57.270
She confesses it.

3565
02:56:57.270 --> 02:56:58.770
I was contracted to themboth.

3566
02:56:58.770 --> 02:57:02.330
All three now marry in aninstant.

3567
02:57:02.330 --> 02:57:04.700
Produce their bodies, bethey alive or dead.

3568
02:57:04.700 --> 02:57:07.400
This judgment of theheavens, which makes ustremble,

3569
02:57:07.400 --> 02:57:09.930
touches us not with pity.

3570
02:57:09.930 --> 02:57:11.270
Here comes Kent.

3571
02:57:11.270 --> 02:57:13.270
Oh, is this he?

3572
02:57:13.270 --> 02:57:15.130
The time will not allowthe compliment

3573
02:57:15.130 --> 02:57:16.670
which very manners urges.

3574
02:57:16.670 --> 02:57:19.730
I am come to bid my kingand master aye good night.

3575
02:57:19.730 --> 02:57:22.170
Is he not here?

3576
02:57:22.170 --> 02:57:23.900
Great thing of us forgot.

3577
02:57:23.900 --> 02:57:25.470
Speak, Edmund. Where's theking?

3578
02:57:25.470 --> 02:57:27.630
And where's Cordelia?

3579
02:57:27.630 --> 02:57:29.630
Yet Edmund was beloved.

3580
02:57:29.630 --> 02:57:31.530
The one, the otherpoisoned for my sake

3581
02:57:31.530 --> 02:57:32.730
and after slew herself.

3582
02:57:32.730 --> 02:57:34.470
I pant for life.

3583
02:57:34.470 --> 02:57:37.830
Some good I mean to do,despite of mine ownnature.

3584
02:57:37.830 --> 02:57:39.630
Quickly send be brief init to the castle,

3585
02:57:39.630 --> 02:57:41.570
for my writ is on the lifeof Lear and on Cordelia.

3586
02:57:41.570 --> 02:57:43.000
Nay, send in time.

3587
02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:44.400
To who, my lord? Who hasthe office?

3588
02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:45.670
Send thy token ofreprieve.

3589
02:57:45.670 --> 02:57:46.730
Well thought on.

3590
02:57:46.730 --> 02:57:48.270
Take my sword; give it thecaptain.

3591
02:57:48.270 --> 02:57:49.730
Haste thee, for thy life.

3592
02:57:49.730 --> 02:57:52.030
He hath commission fromthy wife and me

3593
02:57:52.030 --> 02:57:54.000
to hang Cordelia in theprison

3594
02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.770
and to lay the blame uponher own despair,

3595
02:57:56.770 --> 02:57:58.170
that she fordid herself.

3596
02:57:58.170 --> 02:57:59.300
The gods defend her.

3597
02:57:59.300 --> 02:58:00.830
Bear him hence awhile.

3598
02:58:05.670 --> 02:58:09.000
Howl!

3599
02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:12.170
Howl, howl!

3600
02:58:12.170 --> 02:58:14.800
Howl!

3601
02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:18.400
O, you are men of stones!

3602
02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:25.370
Had I your tongues andeyes, I'd use them so

3603
02:58:25.370 --> 02:58:29.130
that heaven's vault shouldcrack!

3604
02:58:32.170 --> 02:58:34.870
She's gone forever.

3605
02:58:34.870 --> 02:58:40.330
I know when one is deadand when one lives.

3606
02:58:40.330 --> 02:58:42.430
She's dead as earth.

3607
02:58:44.500 --> 02:58:45.800
Lend me a looking-glass.

3608
02:58:45.800 --> 02:58:50.000
If that her breath shouldmist or stain the stone,

3609
02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:51.230
why, then she lives.

3610
02:58:51.230 --> 02:58:52.230
Is this the promised end?

3611
02:58:52.230 --> 02:58:53.870
Or image of that horror?

3612
02:58:53.870 --> 02:58:54.930
Fall, and cease.

3613
02:58:54.930 --> 02:58:58.530
This feather stirs; shelives!

3614
02:58:58.530 --> 02:59:00.830
If it be so, it is achance

3615
02:59:00.830 --> 02:59:03.970
which does redeem all sorrowsthat ever I have felt.

3616
02:59:03.970 --> 02:59:05.230
O my good master!

3617
02:59:05.230 --> 02:59:06.870
Prithee, away.

3618
02:59:06.870 --> 02:59:08.230
'Tis noble Kent, yourfriend.

3619
02:59:08.230 --> 02:59:11.930
A plague upon youmurderers, traitors all!

3620
02:59:11.930 --> 02:59:14.430
I might have saved her.

3621
02:59:14.430 --> 02:59:17.730
Now she's gone forever.

3622
02:59:19.330 --> 02:59:22.970
Cordelia, Cordelia.

3623
02:59:22.970 --> 02:59:24.670
Stay a little.

3624
02:59:24.670 --> 02:59:26.130
Ha!

3625
02:59:26.130 --> 02:59:27.970
What is't thou say'st?

3626
02:59:27.970 --> 02:59:32.000
Her voice was ever soft,gentle, and low,

3627
02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.600
an excellent thing inwoman.

3628
02:59:36.700 --> 02:59:39.270
I killed the slave thatwas a-hanging thee.

3629
02:59:39.270 --> 02:59:40.670
'Tis true, my lords, hedid.

3630
02:59:40.670 --> 02:59:42.000
Did I not, fellow?

3631
02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:43.430
I have known the day,

3632
02:59:43.430 --> 02:59:47.630
with my good bitingfalchion, I'd have madethem skip.

3633
02:59:47.630 --> 02:59:51.030
I am old now,

3634
02:59:51.030 --> 02:59:56.330
and these same crossesspoil me.

3635
02:59:56.330 --> 02:59:58.170
Who are you?

3636
02:59:58.170 --> 03:00:01.730
Mine eyes are not o' thebest; I'll tell youstraight.

3637
03:00:01.730 --> 03:00:04.070
If fortune brag of two sheloved and hated,

3638
03:00:04.070 --> 03:00:05.130
one of them, we behold.

3639
03:00:05.130 --> 03:00:06.470
This is a dull sight.

3640
03:00:06.470 --> 03:00:07.530
Are you not Kent?

3641
03:00:07.530 --> 03:00:10.630
The same, your servantKent.

3642
03:00:10.630 --> 03:00:12.130
Where is your servantCaius?

3643
03:00:12.130 --> 03:00:13.370
He's a good fellow.

3644
03:00:13.370 --> 03:00:15.370
He'll strike, and quicklytoo.

3645
03:00:15.370 --> 03:00:18.230
He's dead and rotten.

3646
03:00:18.230 --> 03:00:21.000
No, my good lord; I am thevery man.

3647
03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:22.300
I'll see that straight.

3648
03:00:22.300 --> 03:00:24.430
That, from your first ofdifference and decay,

3649
03:00:24.430 --> 03:00:25.800
have followed your sadsteps.

3650
03:00:25.800 --> 03:00:26.830
You are welcome hither.

3651
03:00:26.830 --> 03:00:28.430
Nor no man else.

3652
03:00:28.430 --> 03:00:32.170
All's cheerless, dark, anddeadly.

3653
03:00:32.170 --> 03:00:34.530
Your eldest daughters havefordone themselves

3654
03:00:34.530 --> 03:00:35.530
and desperately are dead.

3655
03:00:35.530 --> 03:00:37.500
Aye, so I think.

3656
03:00:37.500 --> 03:00:39.370
He knows not what he says.

3657
03:00:39.370 --> 03:00:40.900
And vain is it that wepresent us to him.

3658
03:00:40.900 --> 03:00:42.800
Very bootless.

3659
03:00:42.800 --> 03:00:45.700
Edmund is dead, my lord.

3660
03:00:45.700 --> 03:00:47.630
That's but a trifle here.

3661
03:00:47.630 --> 03:00:51.630
You lords and noblefriends, know our intent.

3662
03:00:51.630 --> 03:00:56.030
What comfort to this greatdecay may come shall beapplied.

3663
03:00:56.030 --> 03:00:58.630
For us we will resign,

3664
03:00:58.630 --> 03:01:00.530
during the life of thisold majesty,

3665
03:01:00.530 --> 03:01:02.470
to him our absolute poweryou, to your rights

3666
03:01:02.470 --> 03:01:04.000
with boot and suchaddition

3667
03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:07.130
as your honors have morethan merited.

3668
03:01:07.130 --> 03:01:10.470
All friends shall tastethe wages of their virtue

3669
03:01:10.470 --> 03:01:12.900
and all foes the cup oftheir deservings.

3670
03:01:12.900 --> 03:01:14.530
O, see, see.

3671
03:01:14.530 --> 03:01:17.170
My poor fool is hanged.

3672
03:01:20.670 --> 03:01:22.030
No.

3673
03:01:24.500 --> 03:01:28.570
No, no life.

3674
03:01:28.570 --> 03:01:35.530
Why should a dog, a horse,a rat have life

3675
03:01:35.530 --> 03:01:38.270
and thou no breath at all?

3676
03:01:41.630 --> 03:01:44.200
Thou'lt come no more

3677
03:01:44.200 --> 03:01:46.670
never,

3678
03:01:46.670 --> 03:01:53.270
never, never,

3679
03:01:53.270 --> 03:01:56.070
never!

3680
03:01:56.070 --> 03:01:58.900
Pray you, undo thisbutton.

3681
03:01:58.900 --> 03:02:01.530
Thank you, sir.

3682
03:02:03.700 --> 03:02:05.230
Do you see this?

3683
03:02:05.230 --> 03:02:07.730
Look on her, look, herlips.

3684
03:02:07.730 --> 03:02:10.000
Look there! Look there!

3685
03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:11.030
He faints!

3686
03:02:11.030 --> 03:02:12.200
My lord, my lord!

3687
03:02:12.200 --> 03:02:13.570
Break, heart; I prithee,break!

3688
03:02:13.570 --> 03:02:14.870
Look up, my lord.

3689
03:02:14.870 --> 03:02:16.430
Vex not his ghost.

3690
03:02:16.430 --> 03:02:18.770
O, let him pass.

3691
03:02:18.770 --> 03:02:21.400
He hates him that wouldupon the rack

3692
03:02:21.400 --> 03:02:24.470
of this tough worldstretch him out longer.

3693
03:02:24.470 --> 03:02:27.370
He is gone, indeed.

3694
03:02:27.370 --> 03:02:32.300
The wonder is he hathendured so long.

3695
03:02:32.300 --> 03:02:35.070
He but usurped his life.

3696
03:02:36.670 --> 03:02:39.400
Bear them from hence.

3697
03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:42.000
Our present business isgeneral woe.

3698
03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:45.470
Friends of my soul, youtwain rule in this realm

3699
03:02:45.470 --> 03:02:48.230
and the gored statesustain.

3700
03:02:48.230 --> 03:02:51.530
I have a journey, sir,shortly to go.

3701
03:02:51.530 --> 03:02:58.070
My master calls me; I mustnot say no.

3702
03:02:58.070 --> 03:03:04.870
The weight of this sadtime, we must obey.

3703
03:03:04.870 --> 03:03:09.900
Speak what we feel, notwhat we ought to say.

3704
03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.930
The oldest hath bornemost.

3705
03:03:14.930 --> 03:03:18.270
We that are young

3706
03:03:18.270 --> 03:03:25.430
shall never see so much,nor live so long.

3707
03:05:33.300 --> 03:05:36.300
