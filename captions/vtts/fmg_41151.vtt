LADYBIRD, FLY AWAY HOME.

YOUR HOUSE IS ON FIRE,
YOUR CHILDREN ARE GONE.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.760
BUT TRY TELLING THAT
TO THE LOCAL LADYBIRDS

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.660
AND THEY SIMPLY
WON'T BELIEVE YOU.

MY FAULT,
SORRY BEATRICE.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.200
I LOVE LADYBIRDS,
HOW ABOUT YOU, BEA?

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.430
I HAVE NO STRONG
FEELINGS, KEITH.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.530
TALKING ABOUT LADYBIRDS, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING AFTER THE SHOW?

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.030
WAS THAT A SEGUE, KEITH?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.700
I THOUGHT WE'D GO FOR A PINT
SOMEWHERE, JUST YOU AND ME.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.260
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.430
I KNOW THIS LITTLE PLACE,
DOES A LOVELY MEAT PIE.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.400
OH! WELL, IF IT
DOES MEAT PIE...

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.700
I THINK WE CAN SPEND SOME TIME
SOCIALIZING, JUST ME AND YOU.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.760
HOWIS MRS. FLEMING
THESE DAYS?

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.660
OH, SHE COULDN'T

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.500
NOT WITH HER
MEDICAL CONDITION.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.330
WELL, I'M VERY SAD
TO HEAR THAT.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.000
SHE'S WIFE IN NAME ONLY, I'M
AFRAID. SEPARATE BEDROOMS NOW.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.300
YOU AMAZE ME.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.460
I JUST DON'T LIKE THE THOUGHT OF
AN ATTRACTIVE, SENSUAL WOMAN

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.300
IN THE PRIME OF LIFE SITTING
ALONE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.360
WHO ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT HERE, KEITH?

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.700
I THINK WE KNOW WHO
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.660

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.300

FEELING VERY BRAVE.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.100
GOOD NIGHT.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.000

KEITH, A QUICK WORD.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.860
IF YOU EVER TOUCH ANY PART OF MY
BODY WITH ANY PART OF YOUR BODY

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.000
EITHER ON AIR OR OFF, OR
EVEN IN YOUR IMAGINATION

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.030
THEN I SWEAR I'M GONNA...

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.730
IS THAT CLEAR?

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.360
NICE SHOW, BEATRICE.
THANK YOU.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.960
KEITH, I KNOW YOU LIKE TO
KEEP THINGS FREE AND LOOSE,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.900
BUT PLEASE STICK
TO THE SCRIPT.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.700
OTHERWISE YOU TEND TO
TALK UTTER, UTTER RUBBISH.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.130
HERO! YOU ALRIGHT?

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.730
FINE, FINE.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.730
I JUST WANTED TO SAY,
UH... GREAT WEATHER.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.530
THANK YOU, CLAUDE.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.460
HERO, CAN I JUST, UM...
ASK YOU SOMETHING?

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.000
GO ON.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.660
HOW COME YOU
JUST KNOW?

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.330
WHAT?

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.900
THE WEATHER, WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN. HOW CAN YOU TELL?

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.630
I JUST READ THE
METEOROLOGICAL REPORTS -

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.260
METEOROLOGICAL, I HAVE
PROBLEMS WITH THAT WORD.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.060
METEOROLOGICAL.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.330
PRECIPITATION,
NIMBUS, ANEMOMETER,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.860
I TELL YOU IF I DON'T HAVE MY
FALSE TEETH IN PROPERLY...

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.960
YOU'VE GOT
FALSE TEETH?

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.960
NO. NO, I WAS
JUST JOKING.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.460
OH, RIGHT. SORRY. I DON'T
ALWAYS SPOT THEM JOKES.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.930
ME NEITHER.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.360
BYE NOW.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.730

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.830
CLAUDE.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.430
WILL YOU GO OUT WITH
ME FOR DRINKS?

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.600
WITH FOOD OR
WITHOUT, DEPENDING...

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.900
WHEN?

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.760
UM, SATURDAY?

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.530
80% CHANCE OF
SHOWERS SATURDAY.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.930
SUNDAY THEN.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.900
CLOUDY,
BRIGHTENING LATER.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.400
TEMPERATURE-WISE WE'RE
LOOKING AT 23 TO 24 DEGREES.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.730
SHOULD BE A
LOVELY DAY.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.130
SO, ARE YOU
UP FOR IT?

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.730
I THOUGHT
YOU'D NEVER ASK.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:16.460
NOW THIS - THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, SEE?

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.630
YOU GOT LIQUIDS. YOU GOT
ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:26.860
IT IS LITERALLY AN ACCIDENT
WAITING TO HAPPEN.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.900
SMELL THAT!

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.360
AN ALCOHOLIC
BEVERAGE.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.200
WELL, NOT ON MY
WATCH, VINCENT.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.660
NOT ON MY WATCH.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.630
MR. FLEMING?

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.600
I'M LOCKING UP NOW,
MR. FLEMING.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.760
SO IF I COULD ASK YOU PLEASE
TO VACATE THE PREMISES.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.260
WHAT?

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.600
WHAT? OH, YEAH.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.700
THAT'S FINE, FINE.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.500
MR. FLEMING?

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.860
EVERYTHING
ALRIGHT THERE?

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.360
UH... RIGHT.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.130
LEONARD, IT'S
NOT MY FAULT.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.660
I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.700
HOW'S HE
DOING, ANYWAY?

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.060
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY I WOULDN'T
BUY HIM ANY GREEN BANANAS.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.500
IF I COULD JUST SEE
SOME I.D., PLEASE.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.300
I'VE BEEN WORKING
HERE FOR 32 YEARS.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.600
UH HUH, UH HUH.
SEEMS TO BE IN ORDER.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.560
COULD I HAVE A WORD ABOUT SOME
HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES?

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.060
LATER, MR. BARRY, PLEASE.

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.930
KEITH'S GOING TO BE FINE,
HE JUST WON'T BE

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.000
COMING BACK TO
WORK ANY TIME SOON.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.600
THAT'S WONDERFUL!

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.860
SORRY. I MEAN, THAT'S
VERY SAD. BUT IT DOES MEAN

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.130
I GET THE SHOW ALL TO
MYSELF, DOESN'T IT?

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.500
YES. UNTIL NEXT
WEEK, ANYWAY.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.960
WHY? WHAT HAPPENS
NEXT WEEK?

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.460
YOU'RE GOING TO BE JOINED
BY.. BY SOMEONE.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.700
SOMEONE...?

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.260
LISTEN, BEA, YOU'RE
NOT TO OVERREACT.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.960
YOU HAVEN'T...

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.600
YOU WOULDN'T...

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.160
I'VE ALREADY OFFERED
HIM THE JOB.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.330
HE'S ALREADY ACCEPTED.
HE STARTS NEXT MONDAY.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.960
RIGHT, WELL, I SUGGEST
YOU START LOOKING

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.400
FOR A NEW FEMALE
PRESENTER.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.930
THE ONE MAN IN THE
WORLD YOU KNOW I HATE!

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.060
HATE IS AN AWFULLY
STRONG WORD.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.330
ALRIGHT, THEN. DESPISE,
ABHOR, LOATHE.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.400
BUT THINK OF
THE SHOW, BEA.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.030
IT'S A DOG-EAT-DOG WORLD NOW,
LOCAL REGIONAL NEWS.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.030
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO STICK
YOU ON A STOOL WITH A LAPTOP.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.400
WE NEED THAT
FRISSON.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.630
THERE IS
NO FRISSON!

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.330
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT YOU
WERE A GREAT TEAM, BEA.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.000
AND THE HOUSEWIVES
ALL STILL LOVE HIM.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.960
WE CALL THEM
WOMEN NOW, LEONARD.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.430
WOMEN ALL LOVE HIM.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.330
NOT ALL WOMEN, LEONARD.
NOT ALL WOMEN.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.600
CAN'T WE JUST...
I DON'T KNOW...

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.100
BUY A NICE NEW SOFA
OR SOMETHING?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.800
ALRIGHT, I'LL
THINK ABOUT IT.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.600
THANKS, BEA.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.630
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION I'M
BRINGING PETER BACK TO DIRECT.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.230
THAT'S SOMETHING,
I SUPPOSE.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.760
WHAT ABOUT DON?

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.760
YES, WELL, WE'RE
LETTING DON GO.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.730
YOU'RE SACKING DON?

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.560
LEONARD, HIS WIFE
HAS JUST LEFT HIM.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.960
I WON'T SACK HIM.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.330
JUST OFFER HIM AN INFERIOR
JOB AND HOPE HE RESIGNS.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.760
STICK HIM ON GRAPHICS
OR SOMETHING.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.430
NO ONE LIKES HIM. HE'S
CONSTANTLY FOULING UP.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.900
MR. BARRY KEEPS FINDING WATER
BOTTLES THAT DON'T CONTAIN WATER

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.200
AND I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
HE LOOKS AT MY DAUGHTER.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.130
ALL THE MEN LOOK
AT HERO LIKE THAT.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.230
THAT'S WHY YOU
EMPLOYED HER.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.260
WELL, I DON'T LIKE HIM.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.960
FIVE MINUTES WITH THE MAN
AND I GET HEARTBURN.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.430
YOU WANTED TO
SEE ME, LEONARD?

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.560
AH, YES, DON.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.430
...NIGHT OWLS, AND
WELCOME TO ATTIC ANTIQUES

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.860
WHERE WE EXAMINE
THE LOST TREASURES

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.300
YOU MAY HAVE LURKING
IN YOUR LOFT AT HOME.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.660
IN TONIGHT'S SHOW:
TOBY JUGS.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.430
NOW, EVERYONE
LOVES A TOBY JUG.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.660
BUT WHAT'S IT
REALLY WORTH?

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.860
HERE IN MIDDLE WALLOP,
A TOBY JUG CAN...

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.000
IT'S PITCH BLACK, PASSPORTS
HAVE BEEN STOLEN,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.560
THE TRANSLATOR'S RUN OFF
WITH THE SOUND EQUIPMENT...

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.460
YOU MAY AS WELL STOP
TALKING, BENEDICK,

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.260
NOBODY'S
LISTENING TO YOU.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.330
BEATRICE! YOU'RE
STILL HERE!

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.930
SO IT WOULD SEEM.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.800
I LIKE THIS, BY THE WAY.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.760
NOT MANY MEN YOUR AGE
CAN GET AWAY WITH THAT.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.260
THE PIRATE LOOK -
ARR! VERY STRIKING.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.360
SORRY. I INTERRUPTED,
DIDN'T I? GO ON.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.030
SO, THE TRANSLATOR'S RUN OFF
WITH THE SOUND EQUIPMENT

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.730
AND THE COMBAT IS
GETTING PRETTY INTENSE...

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.400
I CAUGHT THAT LATE NIGHT
ANTIQUES THING, BY THE WAY.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.200
LATE NIGHT OR VERY EARLY
MORNING. IS THAT A PRE-RECORD

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.400
OR DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
TO STAY UP UNTIL 4:00 AM?

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.760
IT'S A PRE-RECORD. YOU'D BE
SURPRISED HOW POPULAR IT IS

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.930
WITH MIDDLE-AGED
WOMEN LIVING ALONE.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.160
OKAY, IF I COULD JUST HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.960
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE AT IT ALREADY.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.030
SHUT UP!

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.700
NOW I'D JUST LIKE TO TAKE
A MOMENT TO WELCOME

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.300
SOME OLD FRIENDS
BACK TO THE FOLD.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.300
I BELIEVE MOST OF
YOU KNOW BENEDICK...

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.600
AND OUR NEW
DIRECTOR, PETER.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.400
WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HAVE
THEM BACK, AND TO SHOW

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.560
JUST HOW PLEASED I'D LIKE
TO HAND OVER TO HERO...

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.530
UH, HERO?

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.300
OH, SORRY.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.760
WE'VE DECIDED WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE A PARTY

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.900
SUNDAY NIGHT, DAD'S HOUSE
TO WELCOME THE NEW TEAM.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.860
AND TO MAKE IT
EXTRA, EXTRA SPECIAL

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.800
IT'S GOING TO
BE FANCY DRESS.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.260
YES! I LOVE
FANCY DRESS!

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.330
DON! CAN I HAVE
A QUICK WORD?

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.130
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING FOR LUNCH?

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.700
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU
DECIDED TO STAY ON, DON.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.660
I KNOW BEING PUT ON GRAPHICS
WAS LIKE A DEMOTION, BUT.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.930
WELL, IT'S A
DEMOTION, SO...

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.860
DON, IT'S GOT TO STOP.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.460
WHAT HAS?

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.760
THE LETTERS, THE PHONE
CALLS, THE FLOWERS.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.600
I CAN BUY SOMEONE
FLOWERS, CAN'T I?

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.260
NOT ANYMORE, NO.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.830
I'M VERY GRATEFUL, BUT...

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:12.630
WELL, I'M WITH CLAUDE NOW
AND I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:16.330
BUT I'VE NEVER FELT LIKE THIS
ABOUT SOMEONE BEFORE.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.400
NOT EVEN MY WIFE.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.830
HERO...?

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.330
YOU'RE ASHAMED OF ME.
THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT?

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.330
THAT'S WHY WE'RE WAY OUT HERE
SO NO ONE ELSE CAN SEE US.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.400
I SEE YOU OUTSIDE
THE HOUSE, DON.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.800
SITTING IN YOUR CAR IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.560
IT'S NOT FAIR. I DON'T
LIKE IT, IT SCARES ME.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.860
I'M SORRY.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.300
YOU CAN'T FORCE SOMEONE
TO LOVE YOU, DON.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.800
YOU CAN'T FORCE
THEM NOT TO EITHER.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.460
BUT YOU WILL FIND
SOMEBODY ELSE.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.830
I KNOW YOU WILL,
YOU'RE A LOVELY MAN.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:48.360
AM I?

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.560
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.760
THAT NIGHT WE
SPENT TOGETHER...

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.230
IT WASN'T BECAUSE YOU
FELT SORRY FOR ME?

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.600
OF COURSE NOT.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.330
YOU WERE JUST
LONELY, THAT'S ALL.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.100
YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE
ELSE, LIKE I FOUND CLAUDE,

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.100
AND YOU'LL FALL
IN LOVE AGAIN,

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.430
AND THEN WE CAN GO BACK
TO BEING GOOD FRIENDS.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.530
I NEED THIS TO BE
OUR SECRET, OKAY?

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:27.430
YEAH.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.900
WELL, WHAT A LOT OF WEATHER
WE'VE BEEN HAVING RECENTLY.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.800
LOOK AT HER.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.000
THE WAY SHE BRINGS THE SUN IN
WITH THE WAVE OF HER HAND.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.900
IT'S ALMOST LIKE SHE'S
MAKING IT HAPPEN FOR REAL,

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.930
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN?

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:43.300
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO
ANYTHING STUPID, ARE YOU?

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.860
LIKE WHAT?

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.560
THE "M" WORD.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.530
NO, 'COURSE NOT.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.760
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE SUCH
A BAD IDEA, WOULD IT?

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.060
IF YOU SAY SO.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.660
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'S GORGEOUS?

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.800
SHE'S VERY
NICE, CLAUDE.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:05.330
I JUST PREFER SOMETHING
A LITTLE LESS... OBVIOUS.

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.360
LIKE WHAT?
I MEAN, WHO?

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.260
I DON'T KNOW.
HER, I SUPPOSE.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.200
BEATRICE?

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.360
IT'S A PURELY
OBJECTIVE STATEMENT.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.700
LIKE COMPARING A
LOTUS TO A PORSCHE.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.900
BIT SEXIST COMPARING
A WOMAN TO A CAR?

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.730
DEPENDS ON THE CAR.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.330
SHE'S A VERY ATTRACTIVE
WOMAN, BEATRICE.

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.760
OR AT LEAST SHE WOULD
BE IF SHE WASN'T SUCH A

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.060
SMALL, CARNIVOROUS
DINOSAUR.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.660
QUICK, SHARP, VICIOUS
LITTLE TEETH.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.300
VELOCIRAPTOR.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.060
EXACTLY,
VELOCIRAPTOR.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.830
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
A BIG NEW FOSSIL FIND, BEA.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.360
IT'S VERY EXCITING.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.200
DON'T CALL ME
BEA, PLEASE.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.230
THOUGHT YOU'D BE GENTLE
WITH ME TONIGHT.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.300
YOU'RE NOT SCARED,
ARE YOU?

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.660
WELL, YOU DID NEARLY KILL
YOUR LAST CO-PRESENTER.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.060
THAT WAS JUSTIFIABLE
HOMICIDE.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.260
DID YOU MISS ME?

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.930
YOU WERE ALL I
THOUGHT ABOUT.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.430
AM I TUGGING
IT TOO HARD?

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.500
TUG HARDER IF
YOU WANT TO.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.060
OH, DEAR.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.660
NEED ANYTHING,
BEATRICE?

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.030
A SHORT LENGTH
OF LEAD PIPE.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.300
ONE MINUTE THEN,
EVERYONE!

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.960
CAN I SPEAK HONESTLY?

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.060
I DON'T KNOW.
CAN YOU?

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.530
BECAUSE CLEARLY YOU'RE
STILL UPSET ABOUT "US".

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:17.830
US? OH, GOD.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.660
ABOUT THE WAY
IT ENDED.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.000
NOTHING HAD STARTED, BEN,
SO HOW COULD IT END?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.630
YOU KNOW, I FEEL BAD ABOUT
TELLING YOU BY TEXT.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:28.060
THIS WOULD BE FUNNY IF
IT WASN'T SO PATHETIC.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.600
AND I'M SORRY, REALLY I AM, BUT
WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS, BEA.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.600
DON'T CALL ME BEA!

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.130
EVERYTHING HAPPY
IN THERE?

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:37.230
FINE.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.930
PERFECT.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.900
<i>GOOD LUCK, AND
WE'RE ON IN 30.</i>

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.930
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
IN YOUR TEETH.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.730
SURE I DO.
SPINACH, RIGHT?

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.760
NO, JUST A STRINGY
BIT RIGHT THERE.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.500
I'LL LIVE WITH
IT, THANK YOU.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.730
OKAY, YOUR DECISION.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:55.130
YOU KNOW, IT REALLY IS THE
OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.600
I WAS TRYING TO HELP, BEN,
BUT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.860
EIGHT, SEVEN...

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.130
WHY DON'T YOU ASK
THE GUYS THEN?

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.430
OKAY, I WILL.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:04.830
GO ON, THEN.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:06.630
GUYS, HAVE I GOT
SOMETHING IN MY TEETH?

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.530
CUE BENEDICK.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.300
AND I'M
BEATRICE EVANS.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.200
WELCOME TO
WESSEX TONIGHT.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.230
MAYBE THIS WASN'T SUCH
A GOOD IDEA AFTERALL.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.030
GREAT, ISN'T IT?

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.060
I'VE BEEN WEARING IT
AROUND THE FLAT ALL DAY.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.060
IT MAKES ME FEEL
POWERFUL, YOU KNOW?

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.660
WHAT AM I WEARING?

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.160
OH!

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.060
TWO FOR THE
PRICE OF ONE!

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.630
LET'S THROW THIS OLD
STUFF OUT NOW, DAD.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.600
I'LL HELP YOU
IF YOU WANT.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.260
I LIKE IT THE
WAY IT IS.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:59.130
BESIDES, YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN
YOU MIGHT NEED YOUR ROOM BACK.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.100
HARDLY LIKELY, IS IT?

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.530
HOW DO I LOOK?

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.430
JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.460
OH, I'M SUPPOSED TO
BE MARILYN MONROE.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:17.860
I MEAN, YOU
LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:22.160
I'M SORRY I'M
MAKING YOU SAD.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.700
ISN'T THAT JUST
YOUR UNIFORM?

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.430
DANGER NEVER SLEEPS,
MR. ARMITAGE.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:55.460
89% OF ACCIDENTS
HAPPEN IN THE HOME.

YOU JUST MADE THAT
STATISTIC UP, DIDN'T YOU?

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.930
DO YOU MIND
USING A COASTER?

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.900
LEAVES A RING
OTHERWISE.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.930
THIS IS MY HOUSE.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.560
BEA!

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.100
HELLO YOU.

WHAT'S SHE COME
DRESSED AS?

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.300
A MAN BY THE
LOOKS OF IT.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.300
MY GOD, LOOK
AT THIS PLACE.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.400
SAME OLD FACES.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.230
TONIGHT WE'RE GONNA
PARTY LIKE IT'S 1939.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.400
WHY IS THERE NEVER A TIN
OPENER WHEN YOU NEED ONE?

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.960
WHO IS THAT? THAT'S
NOT MARGARET, IS IT?

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.860
HI.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.800
HAVEN'T YOU GOT SHEEP
TO LOOK FOR?

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.530
THAT'S BO PEEP, I'M

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.360
WHAT HAVE YOU

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.060
OH, JUST SOME
VAGUELY SEXY CAT.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.930
THERE'S NO REAL
LOGIC TO IT.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:43.130
SEE, MISS MUFFET'S
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.930
I'VE GOT A SPIDER.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.630
JUST SOME OLD LEOTARD
I FOUND TANGLED UP

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.330
IN MY LINGERIE
DRAWER.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.300
AND WHAT'S SO SEXY ABOUT
THIS PARTICULAR CAT?

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.830
YOU TELL ME.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.600
I DO HAVE A
TUFFET, ACTUALLY.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.400
I PUT IT, UM...

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.500
IF YOU WOULD...

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:05.400
I HUMBLY ASK YOU
TO CONSIDER...

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.530
I'D BE OVER THE
MOON IF YOU'D...

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.000
DON!

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.730
HAVING FUN?

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.360
OH, YOU KNOW ME.
CRYING ON THE INSIDE.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:19.930
SO, BOSS'S DAUGHTER,
EH? SMART MOVE.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.330
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.930
NOTHING! JUST SHE'S A VERY
BEAUTIFUL GIRL, THAT'S ALL.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:29.100
VERY POPULAR.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.160
EVERYONE
LOVES YOUR HERO.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:39.030
YOUR HERO, MY HERO,
EVERYONE'S HERO.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:43.000
I'M GOING TO GET A REFILL,
DO YOU WANT ANYTHING?

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.330
WHAT? NO, I'M
ALRIGHT, THANK YOU.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.260
AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE CAMERA IS, UM,

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.760
WELL, IT'S LIKE
YOU OWN IT.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.100
YOU'RE SO MUCH MORE
THAN JUST THE WEATHER GIRL.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.130
WELL, I PREFER TO THINK OF
MYSELF AS A BROADCASTER.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:00.960
YOU'RE MORE
THAN THAT.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.000
YOU'RE A
COMMUNICATOR.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.760
THANK YOU, BEN.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.530
MARGARET'S
LOOKING FOR YOU.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.900
WHERE?

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.660
UPSTAIRS IN
YOUR OLD ROOM.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.360
OKAY, SEE YOU LATER.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.760
JUST GIVE IT
A REST, EH?

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.800
WHAT, WHAT HAVE I DONE?

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.600
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.630
CLAUDE, WHAT...?

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:29.060
CLAUDE?

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.560
CLAUDE!

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.000
IT IS CLAUDE, ISN'T IT?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.800
COME TALK TO ME.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.460
WHERE'S YOUR
SIDEKICK, CLAUDE?

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.860
SIDEKICK?

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.030
PROBABLY WORKING HIS WAY
THROUGH THE BUFFET,

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:50.160
SEEING HOW MANY CHICKEN
FRIES HE CAN FIT IN HIS MOUTH.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.730
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.760
WELL, THEY SAY THE CAMERA
ADDS EIGHT POUNDS

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.760
BUT HE'S NOT ON
CAMERA NOW, IS HE?

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.400
MAYBE HE'S...

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.260
SORRY, I CAN'T HEAR
YOU, CLAUDE.

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.360
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
YOUR HELMET OFF?

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.100
BENEDICK STILL SEEMS VERY
POPULAR WITH THE LADIES.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.260
WELL, THAT'S WHAT HE LIKES
YOU TO BELIEVE, YEAH.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.930
BUT THAT BEARD...

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:10.430
IT'S LIKE HE'S GOT FOOD
SMEARED AROUND HIS MOUTH.

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.300
IT'S JUST AS WELL YOU NEVER
HAVE TO KISS HIM THEN.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.830
AND FOR THAT I THANK
GOD EVERY DAY.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.000
WHAT WOULD YOU
DO IF I...

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.300
YOU'RE MUMBLING
AGAIN, CLAUDE.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.400
I SAID I'LL TELL BENEDICK
WHAT YOU SAID.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.800
FINE, TELL HIM!

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.330
HE'LL JUST TRY AND COME BACK
WITH SOME SMARTASS REMARK

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.100
AND IT WON'T BE
FUNNY OR MAKE SENSE

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.330
AND NOBODY'LL BE
LISTENING TO HIM ANYWAY.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.800
EXCUSE ME A
MINUTE, WOULD YOU?

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.630
CLAUDE?

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:36.930
WHAT? IS IT
SOMETHING I'VE SAID?

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:39.530
CLAUDE?

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.360
I'M TELLING YOU NOW SO YOU
HAVE PLENTY OF WARNING.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.030
LEONARD'S HIRED A
KARAOKE MACHINE.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.700
SHE IS SATAN!

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.300
SHE LOOKS NORMAL BUT
SHE'S SATAN IN HUMAN FORM!

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.260
WHAT IS IT NOW?

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.100
IT'S LIKE HE'S TRYING TO
SEND ME SOME SORT OF SIGNAL,

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:18.000
YOU KNOW, TEARS
OF A CLOWN AND ALL.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.700
I HATE CLOWNS.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.800
AS IF HE WEREN'T CREEPY
ENOUGH AS IT IS.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.800
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU MANAGED IT.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.530
THE HOT BREATH, THAT SWEATY
FACE BARRELING DOWN AT YOU.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.930
HEY, DON'S ALRIGHT.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.430
TALKING AND CRYING ABOUT
HOW LONELY HE WAS.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.200
I JUST FELT
SORRY FOR HIM.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.130
DOES HE KNOW THAT,
DO YOU THINK?

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.360
THAT YOU SLEPT WITH
HIM OUT OF PITY?

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.160
BECAUSE MEN LOVE
THAT - PITY SEX.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.260
I'D JUST LIKE TO FORGET
ABOUT IT, PLEASE.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.960
FIVE FOOT EIGHT, AND
I'M FIVE FOOT FOUR.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.030
THAT MUCH MORE AND I'D
HAVE BEEN OUT THERE NOW

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.430
ON A STAKEOUT
OR SOMETHING.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:01.230
IT'S BIGOTRY,
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:04.460
THERE'S NO PROVEN
CONNECTION BETWEEN HEIGHT

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:08.660
AND THE ABILITY
TO FIGHT CRIME.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.800
POIROT'S NOT
A BIG MAN.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.760
MORSE IS STALKY,
NOT TALL.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:25.230
COLUMBO, TINY.
ABSOLUTELY TINY.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.100
OH, GOD. HERE
SHE COMES.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:31.460
QUICK, GIVE ME
SOMETHING TO DO.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.830
DO YOU WANT
A REFILL?

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:36.060
HOW ABOUT AN
ASHTRAY?

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.760
I DON'T SMOKE.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.430
GENTLEMEN.

SO... NICE RUFF.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.200
THANK YOU.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.030
HOW ABOUT A
DANCE THEN, EH?

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:00.430
BIT OF
CARDIOVASCULAR.

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:02.260
NO, I DON'T
THINK SO.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.800
I'M TRYING TO BE
FRIENDLY HERE, BENEDICK.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.360
THIS IS IT. ME
BEING FRIENDLY.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:14.430
I'D MAKE THE MOST
OF IT IF I WERE YOU.

♪<i> THE LOOK OF LOVE

HAVEN'T HAD THIS MUCH FUN

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.030
LIKE CONJUNCTIVITIS.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.860
OH, CLAUDE.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.500
OH, HERO.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.000
SAY TO ME THOSE
THREE LITTLE WORDS.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.800
ME. LOVE. YOU.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.160
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.960
BLAH BLAH
BLAH BLAH.

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.500
OH, GOD, HERE WE GO.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.200
AT LEAST WHEN THEY'RE KISSING
THEY'RE NOT TALKING.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.100
THEY'RE TRYING, THOUGH.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.830
I CAN'T THINK OF
ANYTHING WORSE

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.130
THAN TO HAVE SOMEONE
SAY THEY LOVE ME.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:28.500
ME TOO.

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.800
THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE
GOT IN COMMON THEN.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.060
NOT MUCH, IS IT?

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.500
NO, NOT MUCH.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:46.100
OH, GOD. IS THIS
WHAT I THINK IT IS?

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.300
HERE WE GO.

HERO IF SHE WOULD MARRY ME.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:23.960
AND I'M DELIGHTED TO SAY THAT
SHE'S AGREED TO BE MY WIFE.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

YOU, UH, MIGHT WANT TO GIVE
IT A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.600
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.260
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.430
DO YOU APPROVE?

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.760
OF COURSE I APPROVE!

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.760
WELL DONE, YOU.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.200
DIDN'T SEE THAT
COMING, DID YOU?

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.860
NOBODY TELLS
ME ANYTHING.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.030
JUNIOR HOCKEY TEAM
FACES RELEGATION?

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:08.860
LOCAL STEEL
BAND TRIUMPHS.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.300
NO.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.860
ANOTHER FISHING
BOAT HAS VANISHED

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.530
IN THE WEYMOUTH
TRIANGLE.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:14.730
COMPLETELY
VANISHED?

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.130
NO, THEY
FOUND IT AGAIN.

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:17.930
WHAT ABOUT THE, UH...

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:20.260
THERE'S A TWO-HEADED FROG
FOUND IN LANGTON MATRAVERS.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.260
THAT'S GROSS.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.900
FORGET IT, THE OTHER SIDE WILL
HAVE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.900
I LOVE THESE BIG NEWS
DAYS, DON'T YOU?

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.960
IT'S LIKE<i> ALL THE
 PRESIDENT'S MEN.</i>

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.030
THERE'S A TERRIBLE
FOG THIS MORNING.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.960
THAT'S NOT QUITE THE KILLER
STORY WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.160
I'M SORRY, BUT I STILL
DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.760
WITH MY STORY.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.230
WHAT WAS IT AGAIN?

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:42.160
THEY ARE CLOSING DOWN THE
LADYMEAD NURSING HOME.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.400
THE RESIDENTS ARE ALL IN THEIR
80'S OR 90'S, A COUPLE OF THEM

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.860
ARE OVER 100 AND THEY'RE
JUST GOING TO DUMP THEM

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.660
IN HOSPITAL WARDS. THEY'RE
NOT ILL, THEY'RE ELDERLY.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.300
THE WHOLE THING STINKS.

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.460
THE NURSING
HOME STINKS?

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:58.760
I DON'T KNOW, ISN'T
IT A BIT WORTHY?

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.830
IT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF STORY
THAT'S RELEVANT TO OUR VIEWERS.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:03.800
LOOK AT THIS: WINNER
OF THIS YEAR'S

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.900
MISS EAST DORSET
BEAUTY CONTEST.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.800
HERE.

"LOCAL FARMER CLIVE DOBBS

HIS LOVELY
DAUGHTER, ROSIE."

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.160
ROSIE'S THE ONE WITH THE
PINT AND THE LAZY EYE.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.330
WHEN WAS IT DECIDED WE HAD
A NIGHTLY MISOGYNIST SLOT?

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:22.000
MISOGYNIST?

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.760
LOOK IT UP, BEN. IT MEANS
SOMEBODY WHO HATES

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.360
OR FEARS WOMEN.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.430
I DON'T HATE WOMEN;
I LOVE WOMEN.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:29.730
OH, SAVE ME FROM MEN WHO
SAY THEY LOVE WOMEN.

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:31.760
THEY ARE THE WORST.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.160
HEAR HEAR.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.960
IT WAS JUST A BIT
OF FUN, BEA.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.160
FINE, HAVE YOUR FUN.
PUT IT ON THE SHOW.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.500
JUST DON'T EXPECT ME TO
PRESENT IT, THAT'S ALL.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.400
I'M SORRY THINGS DOWN
HERE AREN'T PROVING

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.330
QUITE AS INTENSE
AS YOU'RE USED TO.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:49.500
I'M SORRY THERE'S BEEN
NO BLOODY CIVIL WAR

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.900
OR NO GREAT HERD OF
DINOSAURS MARAUDING DOWN

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:56.260
THE NEWTON-ABBOT BYPASS BUT
I HAPPEN TO LOVE THIS JOB

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.760
AND THE PEOPLE AND I HAPPEN
TO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.400
AND WORTHWHILE AND DESERVING
OF SOME BASIC RESPECT

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.830
AND IF YOU DON'T AGREE YOU'D
BETTER PACK UP YOUR SHINY SUITS

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:08.300
AND YOUR PLASTIC BAG AND
SOD OFF BACK TO LONDON.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.260
DO YOU EVER LISTEN TO
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY?

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.930
IF SOMEONE'S
WORTH LISTENING TO.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.660
HOW DO YOU
KNOW I'M NOT?

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.530
PAST EXPERIENCE.

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:17.600
WELL, IT MUST GET
PRETTY LONELY UP THERE

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.700
ON THE MORAL
HIGH GROUND.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.160
NO, IT'S WONDERFUL. WHAT'S IT
LIKE DOWN THERE IN THE GUTTER?

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.160
YOU SNOB.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:23.960
YOU APE.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:24.960
PRIG.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.230
CLOWN.

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:30.160
COME ON, BEN, THINK.
FASTER, FASTER.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:36.160
YOU SOUR, COLD-HEARTED,
JOYLESS BITCH!

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:46.230
RIGHT, OKAY. THIS IS
HOW IT'S GOING TO GO.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:49.800
WE TURN UP, WE DO THE SHOW, WE
GO HOME AND THAT'S IT, AGREED?

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.260
FINE BY ME.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.400
WE FOUND THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL VENUE

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.460
AND THE MENUS
WERE FINALIZED.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.460
OH, PLEASE LET
IT BE SALMON.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.200
IT IS SALMON!

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.630
YAY.

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:07.900
AND THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:14.860
CLAUDE AND I HAVE TALKED,
AND WE WOULD LOVE IT

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.760
IF YOU COULD BE OUR
CHIEF BRIDESMAID.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.660
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:24.400
YOU'RE THINKING YOU'RE WAY
TOO OLD TO BE A BRIDESMAID.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.000
YUP, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M THINKING.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.330
SO YOU COULD BE WHATEVER AN
OLDER BRIDESMAID IS CALLED.

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:32.000
THE MAID OF HONOR -
IS THAT IT?

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.760
OR MATRON.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.060
WHAT IS IT?

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.160
OH, YOU ARE PLEASED,
AREN'T YOU?

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.030
IT IS A DREAM
FULFILLED.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:44.330
BUT IF YOU THROW
THE BOUQUET AT ME

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:46.330
I WILL THROW
A BOTTLE BACK.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:47.830
POINT TAKEN.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:49.630
WHO'S BEST MAN,
BY THE WAY?

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:51.630
WILL I HAVE TO
MAKE A SPEECH?

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:53.530
FINE, IT'S
YOUR FUNERAL.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:56.000
I PREFER TO THINK OF IT MORE AS
A DAY OF JOY AND CELEBRATION.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.900
I KNOW, I KNOW.
SORRY, MATE.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.830
I'D LOVE TO DO IT,
OF COURSE I WOULD.

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.300
THANKS, MATE.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.230
ONE MINUTE, EVERYONE!

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:12.400
BAD HAIR DAY?

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.430
BAD FACE DAY?

00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:16.030
EVERYBODY HAPPY HERE?

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:17.960
FINE.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.760
WANT ME TO
DO YOU NOW?

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.130
I'D LOVE THAT.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.300
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
THIS ONE? IS IT A BIT MUCH?

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.130
MAYBE SOMETHING
A LITTLE PLAINER?

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:30.130
A NOOSE PERHAPS.

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.330
OKAY, STAND BY STUDIO.

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:36.300
SOMETIMES I THINK YOU'RE A
LITTLE JEALOUS OF THAT ONE.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:41.000
YOU REALLY DO PUT THE "W"
INTO ANCHORMAN, DON'T YOU?

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
GOOD EVENING.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.860
I DON'T GET PAID ENOUGH
FOR THIS, LEONARD.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.460
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
YOU CAN DO, PETE.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.560
WHY ARE YOU
ASKING ME?

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.900
YOU'RE THE
DIRECTOR!

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.760
VT IN THREE,
TWO, ONE.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.730
AND ROLL VT.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:59.060
OKAY, I'LL
THINK OF SOMETHING.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:09.530
THIS IS THE 6:00 NEWS FROM THE
BBC WITH BENEDICK TAYLOR.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.430
HELLO, AND WELCOME
TO NEWSNIGHT.

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:18.600
I'M BENEDICK TAYLOR.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.760
LEONARD: YOU KNOW, IN
MANY WAYS I BLAME MYSELF.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.930
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
INVITED HIM BACK

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:27.500
KNOWING HOW SHE
FEELS ABOUT HIM.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.530
NOT SO, DAD.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.730
NO, IT'S MY FAULT
FOR MEDDLING.

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:34.130
I THOUGHT PERHAPS IF I
PUT THEM BACK TOGETHER

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:36.260
HE'D FINALLY SEE WHAT
A FAT-HEAD HE'S BEEN.

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.200
BUT NOW THE WHOLE FUTURE
OF THE SHOW'S IN JEOPARDY.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.900
AUDIO OUT.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.460
HE'S COMING!

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.460
ALRIGHT, POSITIONS
EVERYONE.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:14.630
(LAUGHING)

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:20.760
HERO: ...SAME AS SHE
SAID TO YOU -

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.400
THAT SHE LOVES HIM
MORE THAN LIFE ITSELF.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.100
HOW STRANGE, OUTWARDLY SHE
APPEARS TO DISLIKE HIM SO MUCH.

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.600
HE'S ALL SHE
TALKS ABOUT.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.530
I SEE, SO HER APPARENT
HOSTILITY IS JUST A PERSONA

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:37.400
SHE ASSUMES TO HIDE
THE ROMANTIC NATURE

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.100
OF HER TRUE FEELINGS
TOWARDS BENEDICK?

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.530
SO, WHY HASN'T
SHE SAID SOMETHING?

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:46.930
WHAT'S THE POINT? YOU
KNOW WHAT A CLOWN HE IS.

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:52.500
HE'LL JUST LAUGH AT HER AND BANG
ON ABOUT HOW HE NEEDS HIS SPACE.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.760
I LOVE BEN BUT AT THE END OF THE
DAY HE'S JUST NOT THAT BRIGHT.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.200
WELL, I THINK HE'S MAD
NOT TO SEE SHE'S SMART,

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.830
SHE'S FUNNY, SHE'S
INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENT -

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:03.260
ABOUT EVERYTHING
EXCEPT LOVING BENEDICK.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.860
SHE'S VERY SEXUALLY
ATTRACTIVE.

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.560
CLAUDE?

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.660
NO, IT'S TRUE.
SHE'S A BEAUTY.

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.460
I TELL YOU, IF I WAS
FIVE YEARS YOUNGER...

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:15.130
(LAUGHTER)

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:17.760
WHAT WAS THAT? IS THERE
SOMEONE OUT THERE?

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.900
NO, THERE CAN'T BE.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.100
SO WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO?

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.530
WELL, WE'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING. I MEAN,

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:39.930
SHE'S DRINKING ALL THE TIME
AND ALL I EVER HEAR IS

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:45.360
"WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH!"

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.800
I HEAR SHE'S THINKING
ABOUT LEAVING THE SHOW.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.660
NO, SHE CAN'T DO THAT!

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:52.100
THE RATINGS ARE UP.
THE VIEWERS LOVE THEM.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.000
BUT SHE'S VERY, VERY
UNHAPPY, LEONARD.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.560
I WOULDN'T BE
SURPRISED IF SHE HAD...

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.260
NO, IT DOESN'T
MATTER.

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.430
NO, GO ON.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:04.260
IF SHE HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT
DOING SOMETHING STUPID.

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.930
THAT'S IT, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO TELL HIM.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.530
NO, YOU MUSTN'T.

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:10.800
SHE'D RATHER DIE THAN SHOW
HOW SHE REALLY FEELS.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.800
THEN WHAT DO I DO?

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.460
JUST WAIT AND HOPE THAT
HE COMES TO HIS SENSES.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:27.900
SHE LOVES ME.

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:34.560
NOW COME TO THINK ABOUT IT,
IT DOES MAKE A KIND OF SENSE.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.530
THE HOSTILITY
AND EVERYTHING...

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:43.960
THAT'S WHY WE CAN
NEVER BE FRIENDS.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.830
IT'S JUST TOO
PAINFUL FOR HER.

00:38:56.430 --> 00:39:00.260
WELL, I SUPPOSE I'LL JUST
HAVE TO LOVE HER BACK.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.460
THERE'LL BE SOME FUN AT MY
EXPENSE, OF COURSE, BUT

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.230
A PERSON'S ALLOWED TO CHANGE
HIS MIND AS HE MATURES.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:09.000
LOVE'S JUST ONE OF THOSE
THINGS A MAN GROWS INTO -

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.660
LIKE JAZZ AND OLIVES.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.760
I'M NOT GONNA LET A
FEW SARCASTIC REMARKS

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.660
CHANGE THE
WAY I FEEL.

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:17.200
AFTER ALL, THE WORLD
MUST BE PEOPLED.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.560
WHEN I SAID I'D
DIE A BACHELOR

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.460
I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT'D TAKE THIS LONG.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.800
AND THERE'S NO
DENYING THE FACT

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.300
THAT SHE'S A VERY
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN.

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:42.500
TALENTED, FUNNY, KIND
- WELL, SHE'S NOT KIND

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:46.830
BUT SHE'S SO SMART,
SO INTELLIGENT.

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:50.030
ABOUT EVERYTHING
EXCEPT LOVING ME.

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:53.730
COULD I SEE SOME
IDENTIFICATION, PLEASE?

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:07.100
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'VE GOT A
BICYCLE PUMP I COULD BORROW?

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:11.030
THE TRICK IS NOT TO
CHANGE MY BEHAVIOR,

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:15.200
NOT TO APPEAR
ARROGANT OR PROUD

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.930
ABOUT THE FACT THAT
SHE'S OBSESSED WITH ME.

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:22.160
THE TRICK IS TO BE
VERY, VERY COOL

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:28.100
AND SUAVE ABOUT
THE WHOLE THING.

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.560
(KNOCK AT
THE DOOR)

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.060
WHO IS IT?

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.960
BEA: IT'S ME.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:39.900
UM, JUST MAKING
MYSELF DECENT.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:42.760
CAN I WAIT THAT LONG?

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:45.430
"CAN I WAIT
THAT LONG?"

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:48.930
YOU'RE INCREDIBLE.
REALLY YOU ARE.

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:51.560
LEONARD SAYS DUE
TO HERO'S HEN PARTY

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.560
THE DEBRIEF'S
BEEN CANCELED.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.960
BEATRICE, THANK
YOU SO MUCH.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.060
FOR WHAT EXACTLY?

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.460
YOU KNOW, MAKING
THE EFFORT.

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:04.030
IF IT HAD BEEN ANY EFFORT
I WOULDN'T HAVE BOTHERED.

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:07.860
WELL, STILL. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH ALL THE SAME.

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:11.860
ARE YOU FEELING
ALRIGHT?

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.760
OF COURSE, WHY?

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.960
YOU'RE SWEATING -
MORE THAN USUAL.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.800
THAT SMELL...

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.430
JUST AFTERSHAVE.

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:21.230
SMELLS LIKE
A PHOTO LAB.

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:23.430
WHAT DO YOU DO
IN THERE ANYWAY?

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:25.500
IT'S NOT A
WOMAN, IS IT?

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.960
COME OUT, SWEETHEART.
DON'T BE ASHAMED.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.360
WHAT WOULD I BE DOING
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN?

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:33.500
BENEDICK, I DON'T CARE.
YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.260
OH, RIGHT. I SEE.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:39.960
WHAT'S THAT LOOK
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.360
WHAT LOOK?

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.100
THAT LOOK.

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:47.560
OH, NOTHING.
NOTHING AT ALL.

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:50.260
ARE YOU
SMOKING CRACK?

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:54.930
NO, YOU KNOW,
JUST HIGH ON... LIFE.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:10.100
OH, MY GOD. I AM HORRIBLY
IN LOVE WITH HER.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.000
(KNOCKING)

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.060
YOU DO KNOW THERE'S
A LARGE BLUE BALL

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.000
HIDDEN IN YOUR
WARDROBE, DON'T YOU?

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.260
I'M DECENT NOW.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.100
I THINK I'LL BE THE
JUDGE OF THAT.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.930
ONE MINUTE, PLEASE.

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.900
CAN I DO YOU
NOW, SIR?

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:34.800
NO, THANK YOU,
MARGARET.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.730
I THINK I'LL MANAGE
BY MYSELF TODAY.

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:38.560
FINE.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.400
TELL ME, DO THEY GIVE YOU
A CLOTHING ALLOWANCE?

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.930
OF COURSE.

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:46.530
IT CAN'T ALL GO ON
SCOTCH, EGGS, AND LAGER.

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:49.800
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,
THIS TIE IS AWFUL.

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:57.230
UH, RIGHT. THAT'S NOT IT. I
SAY SOMETHING MEAN TO YOU,

00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:00.100
YOU SAY SOMETHING MEAN TO
ME AND WE GO ON FROM THERE

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.700
UNTIL YOU CAN'T THINK OF
ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:04.400
THOSE ARE THE RULES.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.530
PERHAPS I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF PLAYING GAMES.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:11.300
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.030
I THINK YOU KNOW.

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:15.800
FREAK.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.200
AND LIVE ON AIR.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.260
GOOD EVENING.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.830
AND RIGHT, LEFT.

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:24.730
IT'S LIKE PATTING YOUR HEAD
AND RUBBING YOUR TUMMY.

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:28.230
SEE, MY HEAD'S
GONE ALL WRONG NOW.

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:32.430
THEY SAY BELLY DANCING
IS GREAT EXERCISE.

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:34.430
WELL, I CAN'T VOUCH
FOR THAT BUT I CAN SAY

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:37.530
I'M COMPLETELY
EXHAUSTED.

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:42.600
FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE...

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.130
THE THINGS I DO
FOR THIS SHOW.

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:47.960
WE'RE IN A WOMEN'S
INSTITUTE THERE,

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.230
PROVING THAT IT'S NOT
ALL ABOUT JAM MAKING.

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:53.930
NOW IF ANY OF YOU ARE
STILL WATCHING OUT THERE,

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:55.660
IT'S TIME FOR HERO.

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:58.560
YOU WERE TREMENDOUS, BY
THE WAY, THE WAY YOU MOVE.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.360
WELL, THANK
YOU, BENEDICK.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.500
THAT'S VERY
KIND OF YOU.

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.960
NO, REALLY. YOU SHOULDN'T
PUT YOURSELF DOWN.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.760
YOU WERE WONDERFUL.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.800
WAY BETTER THAN
THE OTHERS.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.500
THAT'S MY
FEELING, ANYWAY.

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.760
HERO, THE WEATHER.

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.130
THANK YOU, BEATRICE.
NOW WE'VE HAD SOME

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:24.860
LOVELY PHOTOS SENT IN
OF THE SUNSET TONIGHT.

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.130
BUT IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT
GETTING YOUR BARBECUE OUT

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:29.130
THIS WEEKEND,
THEN I'D THINK AGAIN.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:31.430
THAT'S RIGHT, THERE'S ONLY
ONE WORD FOR THE WEATHER

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:35.100
THIS WEEKEND AND THAT
WORD IS "VERY CHANGEABLE".

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:40.300
WE NEED TO TALK.

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.760
CAN IT WAIT UNTIL I'VE
GOT MY TROUSERS ON?

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:45.260
NO.

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.230
WE CAN'T GO
ON LIKE THIS.

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:48.830
I COMPLETELY AGREE.

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:50.830
YOU ARE DRIVING
ME CRAZY.

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:52.600
WELL, IF YOU'D LET ME
GET MY TROUSERS ON.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.000
I'M SERIOUS, BENEDICK.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.700
I'M SERIOUS TOO.

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.730
YOU'VE BEEN MAKING MY
LIFE AN ABSOLUTE MISERY.

00:44:57.730 --> 00:44:59.660
I KNOW. BUT I'M SORRY.

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.700
IF I'D KNOWN HOW
YOU FELT, BEA.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.760
DON'T CALL ME BEA. NOW WE
NEED TO SIT DOWN AND SEE IF

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.930
WE CAN COME TO SOME MUTUALLY
SATISFYING ARRANGEMENT.

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:08.530
ARRANGEMENT?

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:10.400
YES, AN ARRANGEMENT.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.900
WELL, OKAY. I WOULDN'T
HAVE PUT IT QUITE AS

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:17.800
CLINICALLY AS THAT, BUT IF
YOU WANT TO FIX A DATE...

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.530
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH NOW?

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:20.900
NOW?

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.030
YES, RIGHT HERE.
LET'S DO IT RIGHT HERE.

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:24.560
OKAY.

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.900
BUT SHOULDN'T I BUY YOU
DINNER OR SOMETHING FIRST?

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.200
WHAT?

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.600
OR WE COULD GO
TO YOUR PLACE.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.960
MY PLACE?

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.330
OR A HOTEL?

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:35.260
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO GO TO A HOTEL?

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:36.900
A NICE HOTEL.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.360
NO, THERE ISN'T TIME. IT'S
HERO'S BLOODY HEN NIGHT.

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:43.260
I'M MOTHER HEN.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.400
I'M GOING TO HELL
IN A STRETCH LIMO.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.160
WELL, DON'T GO.

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:51.200
I'VE GOT TO GO. SOMEBODY'S
GOT TO CARRY ALL THE SEX TOYS.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:55.030
LOOK, I'M GOING TO SEE YOU
THIS WEEKEND AT THE WEDDING,

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:58.100
SO WHY DON'T WE FIND TIME TO
TALK THINGS THROUGH THEN?

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.500
FINE.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.730
SUITS YOU, BY THE WAY.

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:05.460
WHAT SUITS ME?

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.630
GOOD NIGHT, BENEDICK.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.360
DON, YOU'RE
WORKING LATE?

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.460
JUST BITS AND
PIECES, YOU KNOW?

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:32.860
PARTY!

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:34.200
COMING!

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.960
HOW DO I LOOK?

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.900
LIKE AN ANGEL.

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.600
SEE YOU AT THE
CHURCH THEN.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.600
SEE YOU AT
THE CHURCH.

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:52.060
BERGERAC,
BERGERAC, BERGERAC.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:47:00.130
HELLO, HELLO.

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:04.600
OH, NO, MY FRIEND. DON'T
EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.160
COVER ME.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.230
DON'T DRINK TOO MUCH.

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:11.730
OH, I'LL STAY SOBER.

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:12.860
DON'T FLIRT.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:14.000
I WOULDN'T DARE.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.230
AND IF GUYS START
HASSLING YOU...

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:17.860
CLAUDE,
YOU'RE JEALOUS.

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.430
OF COURSE, FIANCEES ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE JEALOUS.

00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:22.660
JEALOUS, NOT INSANE.

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:25.500
I CAN LOOK AFTER MYSELF.
JUST TRUST ME, OKAY?

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.930
WE ARE LEAVING
WITHOUT YOU.

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:29.100
ONE MINUTE!

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:33.030
JUST REMEMBER I LOVE YOU
- OH, VERY, VERY MUCH -

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:35.800
AND I CAN'T WAIT TO
BE MARRIED TO YOU.

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.360
WHAT'S THE FORECAST?

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.700
IT'S GOING TO BE
A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:41.800
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
YOU FORGOT THIS.

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.860
DON, THANK YOU.
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.760
I'VE GOTTA RUN.

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.460
SEE YA!

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:48.960
BE GOOD.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.800
I'LL TRY!

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.260
PROBLEM?

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:08.600
♪

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.530
BENEDICK!

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:12.100
BENEDICK, ABSOLUTELY!

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.560
WHO'S BENEDICK, THAT
GUY ON YOUR SHOW?

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.730
OH, YEAH,
BENEDICK DEFINITELY.

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:18.430
WHAT IS IT ABOUT HIM,
DO YOU THINK?

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:19.930
SENSE OF HUMOR.

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:23.300
WHY DO PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY "SENSE
OF HUMOR" WHEN THEY MEAN SEX?

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:27.130
HE JUST HAS THIS AIR LIKE HE'D
KNOW HIS WAY AROUND, YOU KNOW?

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:30.530
ENTHUSIASTIC, A BIT
DIRTY, I LAUGH.

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:33.200
MAYBE IT'S THE WAY HE
STARES AT YOUR BREASTS

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.830
WHEN HE'S TALKING
TO YOU.

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:37.560
I DON'T MIND THAT.
WELL, I DON'T!

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.600
BEATRICE, YOUR TURN!

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.600
CAN'T WE PLAY
SOMETHING DIFFERENT?

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.230
CHESS OR SOMETHING.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:45.000
COME ON, PLAY
THE GAME.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.900
OTHERWISE YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DRINK THE FORFEIT.

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:49.830
FINE, FINE.

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:55.560
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE
ME, I JUST HAVE TO

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.260
MAKE A PHONE CALL
OR SOMETHING.

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:03.330
PHASE TWO?

00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:04.900
LET'S DO IT!

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.060
WELL, I THINK IT'S
A CRYING SHAME.

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:18.330
HE LOVES HER SO MUCH.

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:20.630
CLAUDE SAYS IT'S ALL
HE EVER TALKS ABOUT.

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:23.260
IT'S THE WAY HE LOOKS AT HER
ON AIR THAT BREAKS MY HEART.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.960
SUCH YEARNING. THERE'S
SO MUCH LOVE THERE.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.130
SOMETIMES HE SAYS HE'S TALKING
TO HER AND IT'S ALL HE CAN DO

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:34.960
NOT TO JUST TAKE HOLD OF HER AND
KISS HER - HARD ON THE MOUTH.

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.660
SO WHY DOESN'T
HE JUST TELL HER?

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:41.430
THERE'S NO POINT. YOU
KNOW HOW PROUD SHE IS.

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:43.930
SUCH AN ATTRACTIVE
WOMAN, TOO.

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:47.530
YEAH, SHE IS NOW, BUT THAT WHOLE
KATHERINE HEPBURN ICE QUEEN ACT

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:51.000
WON'T BE LOOKING SO
CLEVER IN FIVE YEARS' TIME.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.460
IF SHE'S NOT CAREFUL SHE'LL TURN
INTO ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO'S

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:57.400
IDEA OF A WILD NIGHT IS A REALLY
BIG TUB OF FROZEN YOGURT.

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.430
HAVE YOU NOTICED SHE'S GETTING
THESE LINES LIKE BRACKETS

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:04.260
AROUND HER MOUTH FROM
SNEERING ALL THE TIME?

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.900
WELL, IF SHE'S SO BLOODY SMART
WHY DOESN'T SHE TREAT HIM WITH

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:10.100
A BIT OF RESPECT INSTEAD OF
LOOKING DOWN HER NOSE AT HIM

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:13.630
ALL THE TIME, THE
STUCK-UP, RIGID OLD COW!

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.660
HAVING SAID ALL THAT,
I MUST EMPHASIZE

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:23.000
THAT I REALLY DO LIKE
HER TREMENDOUSLY.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.060
ANYONE SMELL SMOKE?

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.930
OH, GOD, SHE'S NOT
IN HERE, IS SHE?

00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:29.360
BEATRICE?

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.330
NO, I THINK SHE
WENT OUTSIDE.

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:33.260
BEATRICE? COME OUT, COME
OUT, WHEREVER YOU ARE.

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.730
OH, CHECK UNDER
THE CUBICLE DOOR.

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:37.960
LET'S GO, SHALL WE?

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:51.700
HE LOVES ME.

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:55.760
WELL, IT MAKES
SENSE I SUPPOSE.

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:58.530
MAYBE I HAVE BEEN A BIT
TOO HARSH ON HIM.

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:01.060
A BIT COLD MAYBE.

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:09.130
NO REASON I CAN'T
BE AT LEAST CIVIL.

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:13.100
AFTER ALL, PEOPLE CAN
CHANGE, CAN'T THEY?

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:18.700
IT IS POSSIBLE.

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:27.060
HERE, ALLOW ME.

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.930
NO, I CAN
MANAGE, REALLY.

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:30.360
OH, MY GOD.

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:31.860
WHAT?

00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:33.530
YOU'VE CHANGED.

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:35.500
I MEAN, YOU SHAVED.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:37.230
WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO YOUR HAIR?

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:39.730
JUST A DAB OF PRODUCT.
DO YOU APPROVE?

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:43.130
YEAH, YOU LOOK,
UM, BETTER.

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:46.060
WELL, GOOD.

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:48.430
ARE YOU TOGETHER?

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:49.700
NO.

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.160
NO, NO.

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.800
THIS IS
BEATRICE EVANS.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.700
AND THIS IS
BENEDICK TAYLOR.

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:57.560
YES, I RECOGNIZE
THE GENTLEMAN...

00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.960
FROM THE TELLY
WHEN I WAS A KID.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.500
YOU USED TO DO THE BIT BETWEEN
THE SHOWS - THE MASCOT?

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:06.200
THE LITTLE TOY BUNNY.

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:11.160
BILLY. BILLY THE
BUNNY'S BIRTHDAY CLUB.

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:14.400
I'VE DONE OTHER STUFF
SINCE, YOU KNOW.

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:17.630
MORE SERIOUS
JOURNALISTIC...

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:20.330
AND IT'S NOT FUNNY.

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:22.530
I HAVE YOU IN
ADJOINING ROOMS.

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:23.900
ADJOINING ROOMS?

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:27.030
I CAN PUT YOU IN DIFFERENT
ROOMS IF YOU'D PREFER.

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:29.130
I DON'T MIND.

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:31.100
I DON'T THINK
IT'S NECESSARY.

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:32.960
THERE'S A LOCK,
ISN'T THERE?

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:35.130
I BELIEVE SO.

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:50.830
BYE THEN.

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:52.560
BYE.

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:00.930
OH!

00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:02.460
SO, I'LL...

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:04.860
SORRY.

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:06.660
SO YOU, UM...

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.030
WHAT?

00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:09.960
ARE YOU GOING
DOWN FOR DINNER?

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.730
NO, I THOUGHT I'D JUST
GET SOME ROOM SERVICE.

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:14.230
OH, OKAY. WHAT WERE
YOU GONNA SAY?

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:17.960
UM, OH I WAS
GONNA SAY...

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.660
SEE YOU IN
THE MORNING.

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:24.160
OH. OKAY. I'LL SEE
YOU IN THE MORNING.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.700
BYE THEN.

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:27.900
BYE.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.860
'NIGHT.

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:32.630
'NIGHT.

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.300
CLAUDE.

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:03.700
DON?

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:04.800
DON!

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.660
DON, DON, DON.
MY OLD MATE.

00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.730
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HOW ARE YOU?

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:11.860
I NEED TO HAVE
A QUICK WORD.

00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:14.060
CAN WE GO
SOMEWHERE PRIVATE?

00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.700
YEAH.

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:17.230
YOU'RE LYING!

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:22.700
IF YOU COULD JUST LET ME DOWN WE
COULD TALK THIS OVER PROPERLY.

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:26.760
THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK
ABOUT BECAUSE IT'S ALL LIES.

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:30.160
JUST ONE MINUTE?

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:36.230
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN
US TALKING, CLAUDE.

00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:40.600
AT WORK, YOU'VE NEVER
NOTICED US TALKING?

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:43.830
SHE FEELS
SORRY FOR YOU.

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:46.500
SHE GAVE ME
THESE PHOTOS.

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:51.000
WE DON'T GET TO SEE EACH OTHER
VERY MUCH SO SHE GIVES ME THESE.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.100
SHE'S WRITTEN ON
THE BACK, SEE?

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:59.330
SHE'S WEARING HER
SWIM SUIT IN THIS ONE.

00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:03.960
VERY, VERY BEAUTIFUL
GIRL, DON'T YOU THINK?

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:07.130
HM, YOU STOLE THESE.

00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:10.660
YOU MUST HAVE STOLEN
THESE AND FORGED THE WRITING.

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:15.560
TEXT MESSAGES - SENT
FROM HER PHONE.

00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:19.860
THIS ONE'S ON
HER HEN NIGHT.

00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:26.730
"I'LL BE HOME LATER. COME
AND SEE ME. I CAN'T WAIT".

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:30.060
IT IS A LOT TO
TAKE IN, I KNOW.

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:33.060
IT SURPRISED ME TOO,
TO BE HONEST.

00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:36.830
I KNOW I'M NOT A VERY
ATTRACTIVE PERSON.

00:55:36.830 --> 00:55:39.430
OR LOVABLE.

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:42.360
OR LIKABLE EVEN.

00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:46.960
BUT HERO, SHE
SEES SOMETHING.

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:54.360
GOD KNOWS WHAT,
BUT SHE SEES IT.

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:59.630
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT SHE'S
ALWAYS BEEN VERY FOND OF YOU

00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:06.700
AND IF YOU WANTED YOU COULD
PROBABLY STILL GET MARRIED.

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:10.300
COME WITH ME
NOW TO HER ROOM.

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:17.230
WATCH WHAT HAPPENS AND THEN
YOU CAN MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND.

00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:16.060
(KNOCKING)

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:20.760
WHO IS IT?

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:24.400
WELL, ME.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:28.900
OH, UM, RIGHT.

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:36.530
UM, COME IN.

00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:44.530
I'M JUST CLEANING MY TEETH
OVER HERE IN THE BATHROOM.

00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:47.360
I'M SORRY, I'LL
COME BACK.

00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:49.130
NO, NO.

00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:55.900
ARE YOU SURE I'M
NOT DISTURBING YOU?

00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:58.400
NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.

00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.930
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANTED TO ASK YOU.

00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:05.400
THE SPEECH TOMORROW, YOU KNOW,
EVERYONE'S EXPECTING ALL KINDS

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:09.130
OF LADDIE HUMOR AND, YOU KNOW, I
JUST WANT TO CHALLENGE PEOPLES'

00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:13.830
PREJUDICES AND READ A
SHAKESPEARE SONNET INSTEAD.

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:15.930
VERY ORIGINAL.

00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:19.660
ISN'T IT? SO I FOUND
THIS POEM AND I WANT TO

00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:22.930
MAKE ABSOLUTELY
SURE I UNDERSTAND IT

00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:25.630
AND YOU'RE A LOT SMARTER
ABOUT THIS STUFF THAN ME.

00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:27.330
GO ON.

00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:30.030
SO I JUST WANTED
TO SAY A FEW TO YOU.

00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:32.660
IS THAT OKAY?

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:35.630
OOH, A POETRY
RECITAL.

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:41.000
I KNOW. I'M A MASS
OF CONTRADICTIONS.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:46.330
SO, UM, YOU HAVE TO
PROMISE NOT TO LAUGH.

00:58:46.330 --> 00:58:48.260
CAN'T PROMISE THAT.

00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:52.060
OKAY, HERE GOES...

00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:54.630
IS THIS A DAGGER
I SEE BEFORE ME!

00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:56.660
JOKE.

00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:59.060
UM, THIS IS
THE ONE HERE.

00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:02.760
SONNET 116.

00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.330
"LET ME NOT...

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:07.830
"TO THE MARRIAGE OF TRUE
MINDS ADMIT IMPEDIMENTS".

00:59:07.830 --> 00:59:10.200
GOD, YOU'RE CLEVER.

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:14.760
IT'S AN ECHO OF THE BIT IN
THE WEDDING CEREMONY.

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:20.630
IT MEANS HE, THE POET,
REFUSES TO ACCEPT ANY REASON

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:23.730
WHY TWO PEOPLE
WHO ARE...

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:26.030
COMPATIBLE?

00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:28.430
SHOULDN'T
BE TOGETHER.

00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:37.800
"LOVE IS NOT LOVE WHICH ALTERS
WHEN IT ALTERATION FINDS".

00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:41.800
TRUE LOVE IS CONSTANT.

00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:45.300
"OR BENDS WITH THE
REMOVER TO REMOVE".

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:47.260
AND YOU CAN'T STOP
LOVING SOMEBODY

00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:54.230
JUST BECAUSE THEY
STOP LOVING YOU.

00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:56.200
"O NO!"

00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:59.360
MEANING O NO!

00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:03.200
"IT IS AN EVER
FIXED MARK".

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.200
OR YOU COULD
SAY "FIX-ED".

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:11.130
THE RHYTHM, IT'S
IAMBIC. FIX-ED.

01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:18.430
"FIX-ED MARK THAT LOOKS ON
TEMPESTS AND IS NEVER SHAKEN.

01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:22.160
IT IS THE STAR TO
EVERY WANDERING BARK

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:27.100
WHO'S WORTH'S UNKNOWN
ALTHOUGH HIS HEIGHT BE TAKEN".

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:30.800
A BARK IS A SHIP. IT'S
A SEA-FARING METAPHOR.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.560
NAVIGATION.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:37.160
THIS THING - LOVE - IS AS
CONSTANT AS THE NORTHERN STAR.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:41.530
IT'S ALWAYS THERE LOOKING OVER
YOU NO MATTER HOW LOST YOU ARE

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:43.960
OR HOW CONFUSING.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.960
YOU LOOK AWKWARD
STANDING THERE.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.130
DO YOU WANT
TO SIT HERE?

01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:56.600
OH, YES. NOW THIS
NEXT BIT IS BEAUTIFUL.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:02.260
"LOVE'S NOT TIME'S FOOL,
THOUGH ROSY LIPS AND CHEEKS

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:06.160
WITHIN HIS BENDING
SICKLE'S COMPASS COME".

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:14.030
MEANING THAT, UH, UM, EVEN
THOUGH WE, OR, OR PEOPLE

01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:17.860
IN GENERAL, MIGHT
GET A BIT KNACKERED,

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:21.830
WE - OR THEY - WILL
STILL FANCY EACH OTHER.

01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:24.860
PARAPHRASING,
OBVIOUSLY.

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:28.230
PARAPHRASING.

01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:37.030
UM, "LOVE ALTERS NOT WITH
HIS BRIEF HOURS AND WEEKS,

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:42.800
BUT BEARS IT OUT EVEN
TO THE EDGE OF DOOM".

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:47.630
UM, TILL DEATH DO US PART,
THE WEDDING VOWS.

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:50.400
EXACTLY.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:55.860
"IF THIS BE ERROR AND UPON
ME PROVED, I NEVER WRIT.

EXCEPT HE DID WRITE.

01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:07.300
AND MEN HAVE FALLEN
IN LOVE BEFORE.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.600
THEREFORE...

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.400
SHAKESPEARE
MUST BE RIGHT.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.100
EXACTLY.

01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:20.830
WE SHOULD
GO TO BED.

01:02:20.830 --> 01:02:23.900
EXCEPT I'M
ALREADY IN BED.

01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:34.900
SO YOU ARE.

01:02:40.830 --> 01:02:44.830
YUP.

01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:47.000
'NIGHT.

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:54.430
AND, YOU KNOW, SWEET
SORROW AND ALL THAT.

01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:57.160
YES, GOOD NIGHT.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:00.560
BENEDICK.

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:04.100
NICE POEM.

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.300
DON, IT'S VERY LATE.

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:23.860
I KNOW.

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.130
I REALLY NEED
TO GET SOME SLEEP.

01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:29.160
I'M SORRY, IT'S JUST, UH,
I'VE HAD A BIT TO DRINK

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.300
AND WHAT WITH THE TALK ABOUT
THE WEDDING AND EVERYTHING

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.560
I GOT TO THINKING
ABOUT MY EX.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:39.100
OH, DON.

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:44.730
I JUST NEED TO TALK TO
SOMEONE, JUST FOR A MINUTE.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.260
SO THIS IS IT?

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.500
THE FAMOUS DRESS.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:07.000
DO YOU THINK
IT'S TOO MUCH?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.900
BEATRICE SAYS IT MAKES ME
LOOK LIKE A SNOWDRIFT.

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.000
SHE'S JUST JEALOUS.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.930
YOU'RE GOING TO
LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:18.930
ISN'T IT BAD LUCK TO
SEE THE WEDDING DRESS

01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:21.360
BEFORE THE BIG DAY?

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.430
ONLY IF YOU WERE
MARRYING ME.

01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:27.700
(PHONE RINGING)

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.700
IT'S CLAUDE.

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:32.030
LET'S NOT TELL HIM
I'M HERE, EH?

01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:35.630
DON'T WANT HIM TO
GET THE WRONG IDEA.

01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:37.630
HELLO?

01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:39.330
HELLO THERE.

01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:41.560
<i>CLAUDE, I THOUGHT
WE AGREED.</i>

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:44.300
I KNOW, I JUST WANTED
TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:45.960
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.530
GETTING READY FOR BED.

01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:49.160
<i>ANYONE WITH YOU?</i>

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.730
LIKE WHO?

01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:53.400
I MEAN MARGARET OR
BEATRICE OR ANYONE?

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.700
NO, I'M BY MYSELF.

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.400
THINKING ABOUT YOU.

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.760
ARE YOU?

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.700
<i>'COURSE I AM.</i>

01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:12.530
<i>CLAUDE, ARE
YOU ALRIGHT?</i>

01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:14.030
I'M FINE.

01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:16.230
YOU JUST SOUND
A LITTLE DISTANT.

01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:18.400
YOU'RE NOT PHONING TO
SAY THE WEDDING'S OFF

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.530
OR ANYTHING LIKE
THAT, ARE YOU?

01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:22.060
NO.

01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:26.560
NO, I WAS JUST PHONING FOR THE
LATEST FORECAST ACTUALLY.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:31.700
LET'S SEE - BRIGHT SUN
AND CLEAR SKIES TO START.

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:34.960
THEN CLOUDS
STARTING TO FORM.

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.830
<i>PATCHY SHOWERS
LATER.</i>

01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:38.430
RAIN.

01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:42.060
<i>IT WON'T RAIN.
BEATRICE FORBIDS IT.</i>

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:46.960
EVEN IF IT DOES, WE WON'T LET
ANYTHING SPOIL OUR DAY, WILL WE?

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.500
NO, 'COURSE NOT.

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:53.300
<i>I'M VERY HAPPY, CLAUDE.</i>

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:58.760
ME TOO. I'M VERY
HAPPY TOO.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.360
TOMORROW THEN.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.760
<i>TOMORROW.</i>

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:19.600
YOU'RE NOT GOING
LIKE THAT, ARE YOU?

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:32.860
BEAUTIFUL. JUST
SO... BEAUTIFUL.

01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:59.760
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT,
LOVERBOY, KEEPING ME WAITING?

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.200
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.030
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:05.200
YOU'RE IN A NICE HOTEL,
HAVE A COUPLE OF DRINKS,

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.760
A WARM, FRAGRANT BATH,
YOUR MIND STARTS TO WANDER.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.100
DO ME UP, WILL YOU? I'VE
COME UNDONE AGAIN.

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:13.130
OH.

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:15.960
I'M STARTING TO THINK YOU
DON'T LOVE ME ANYMORE.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:19.600
IN FACT, I THINK YOUR
AFFECTIONS LIE ELSEWHERE.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.000
OKAY, IF EVERYBODY COULD START
TAKING THEIR PLACES, PLEASE.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.530
SORRY, THAT'S
MY JOB, ISN'T IT?

01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:25.460
YES, IT IS.

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:26.930
UH, IF I COULD
JUST HAVE A...

01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:29.000
JUST GIVE ME
ONE SECOND.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.900
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.300
MR. ARMITAGE, THERE'VE
BEEN A NUMBER OF STRANGE

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:35.600
OCCURRENCES AND WE'VE TAKEN THE
LIBERTY OF JOTTING THEM DOWN.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.500
CAN THIS WAIT,
MR. BARRY?

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.730
I'M ABOUT TO GIVE
AWAY MY ONLY CHILD.

01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:42.200
I UNDERSTAND, IT'S JUST
THAT MY DEPUTY VINCENT

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.300
WAS ON PATROL LAST NIGHT AND
HE OVERHEARD SOMETHING.

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.960
NOW VINCENT, TELL HIM
EXACTLY WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.900
SORRY, CAN YOU START TAKING YOUR
PLACES IN THE CHURCH, PLEASE.

01:08:03.530 --> 01:08:06.430
JUST REMEMBER, IF
YOU WANT TO BAIL OUT,

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:10.700
GIVE ME THE WORD,
WE'LL MAKE A RUN FOR IT.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:14.600
IS THIS HELPING YOU TO
RELAX IN ANY WAY AT ALL?

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:22.460

THANK YOU.

01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:07.330
I'M SORRY.

01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:09.700
DON'T BE DAFT.
WHAT FOR?

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:12.130
CLAUDE,
YOU'RE SHAKING.

01:09:12.130 --> 01:09:14.700
DEAR FRIENDS, WE ARE
GATHERED HERE TODAY

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.500
BEFORE THE CONGREGATION
TO JOIN TOGETHER

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.600
THIS MAN AND WOMAN
IN HOLY MATRIMONY.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:24.460
MARRIAGE IS A SOLEMN VOW
MADE IN THE SIGHT OF GOD.

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:28.800
THEREFORE, IF ANY PERSON
CAN SHOW ANY JUST CAUSE

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:33.200
OR IMPEDIMENT WHY THIS MAN AND
THIS WOMAN MAY NOT LAWFULLY BE

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:39.260
JOINED TOGETHER, LET HIM SPEAK
NOW OR FOREVER HOLD HIS PEACE.

01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:42.160
I DO.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:45.030
"I DO" COMES LATER.

01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:48.260
SO WE'LL JUST PROCEED WITH
THE SERVICE, SHALL WE?

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:51.430
THEY'RE FINE. BAD
JOKE, CARRY ON.

01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:54.460
I'M SORRY, BUT I DO
KNOW OF AN IMPEDIMENT.

01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:56.800
CAN YOU THINK
OF ONE, HERO?

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.860
NO.

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:02.330
NOTHING AT ALL?
COME ON, THINK.

01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:04.260
IT'S OBVIOUS, REALLY.

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:06.130
STOP THIS
PLEASE, CLAUDE.

01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:08.560
HERE'S A CLUE.

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.030
HOW ABOUT LYING?

01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:15.200
HOW ABOUT THE FACT SHE'S A
LYING, CHEATING, SCHEMING,

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.930
DECEITFUL BITCH!

01:10:16.930 --> 01:10:18.430
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:20.360
YOU'RE HERE TO GIVE HER AWAY,
LEONARD, IS THAT RIGHT?

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.030
WELL, I DON'T WANT HER.
SHE'S ROTTEN GOODS.

01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:26.230
HERE, YOU CAN
TAKE HER BACK.

01:10:26.230 --> 01:10:29.730
LOOK AT HER! THE BLUSHING
BRIDE, ALL INNOCENT.

01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:32.100
YOU'D NEVER GUESS
FROM THAT FACE

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.600
WHAT A DISHONEST LITTLE
TART SHE REALLY IS.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.300
COME HERE YOU!

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.100
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
ARE YOU DOING THIS?

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.930
I KNOW THE
TRUTH, HERO!

01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:41.860
I KNOW ABOUT
THE TWO OF YOU.

01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:44.660
THE SECRET MEETINGS,
THE PICNICS ON THE BEACH,

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.100
THE MESSAGES,
THE PHOTOGRAPHS.

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:48.960
WHAT MESSAGES?
WHAT PHOTOGRAPHS?

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:51.460
I SAW HIM GO TO
YOUR ROOM, HERO.

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.460
I SAW YOU KISS HIM.

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:55.630
I SAW YOU PUT YOUR
ARMS AROUND HIM.

01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:57.900
I WAS WAITING
OUTSIDE.

01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:01.500
THE NIGHT BEFORE
YOUR WEDDING, HERO?

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:04.560
WHO? DON? ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT DON?

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.430
SORRY, HERO. I
HAD TO TELL HIM.

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:09.930
THAT DON?

01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:13.500
WAS HE OR WASN'T HE IN
YOUR ROOM LAST NIGHT?

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:18.630
NO! I MEAN, YES, HE CAME TO
MY ROOM BUT JUST TO TALK.

01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:20.560
I FELT SORRY FOR HIM.

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.530
FELT SORRY FOR HIM?
THAT'S A GOOD ONE!

01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:26.260
AND HOW MAN OTHER MEN
HAVE YOU FELT SORRY FOR?

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.760
STOP THIS, CLAUDE.
YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.430
ALRIGHT, ONE MORE
QUESTION THEN.

01:11:30.430 --> 01:11:32.500
ANSWER ME THIS.

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.930
HAVE YOU SLEPT
WITH HIM?

01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:38.960
DENY IT. GO ON.
HERE, IN CHURCH.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:46.160
PLEASE HERO. I WANT SO
MUCH FOR YOU TO DENY IT.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:51.060
ANSWER HIM,
SWEETHEART.

01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:56.960
I THOUGHT YOU
LOVED ME, CLAUDE.

01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:02.060
IF YOU LOVED ME YOU
WOULDN'T DO THIS TO ME.

01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:05.960
AND YOU'VE BROKEN
MY HEART, CLAUDE.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:12.760
SHE DIDN'T DENY IT, LEONARD.
SHE DIDN'T DENY IT.

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:42.030
THEY'VE TAKEN HER
BACK TO THE HOTEL.

01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:45.830
TRY AND CALM
HER DOWN.

01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:48.960
I CAN'T BELIEVE I
WROTE A SPEECH.

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:55.760
GENERALLY SPEAKING I
THINK IT WENT PRETTY WELL.

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:58.530
YOU'RE CRYING.

01:12:58.530 --> 01:13:03.760
YES. AND I INTEND TO
CRY A LITTLE LONGER.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.960
I HATE
SEEING YOU CRY.

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:08.700
WELL, DON'T WORRY.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.460
NOT THIS
TIME ANYWAY.

01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:21.400
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
NOTHING IN THIS WORLD

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:23.860
I LOVE AS
MUCH AS YOU.

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:26.230
ISN'T THAT STRANGE?

01:13:26.230 --> 01:13:31.000
ALMOST AS STRANGE AS IF
I WERE TO SAY I LOVE YOU.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.700
I'D BEEN LED TO
BELIEVE - TO HOPE -

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:41.460
THAT PERHAPS
THAT WAS THE CASE.

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:44.960
I LOVE YOU, BEATRICE.

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.030
THERE YOU GO.

01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:49.630
I'VE NEVER SAID
THAT BEFORE.

01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:52.560
WELL, IT MIGHT HAVE
SLIPPED OUT ONCE OR TWICE

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.230
IN THE HEAT OF
THE MOMENT.

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:58.630
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY IT AND MEAN IT.

01:13:58.630 --> 01:14:00.360
BEN.

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:03.000
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, BEATRICE,
THAT IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.860
I THINK I'LL GO MAD.

01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:06.600
THEN I'M SORRY,
BENEDICK.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.560
WHAT ARE YOU SORRY
FOR, BEATRICE?

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:11.830
YOU'VE CAUGHT ME AT
A VERY UNHAPPY TIME.

01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:15.160
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY
I LOVED YOU TOO.

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:18.100
WELL, SAY IT THEN.

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:24.500
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH I
CAN HARDLY BREATHE.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:37.200
BEATRICE, I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR
YOU - ANYTHING YOU ASK.

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.830
KILL CLAUDE.

01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:44.460
EXCEPT FOR
THAT MAYBE?

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:47.300
WHY NOT? I FEEL
LIKE KILLING HIM.

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:49.260
I'M SURE HE HAD
HIS REASONS.

01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:53.260
WHAT REASONS COULD
HE POSSIBLY HAVE FOR

01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:56.360
HUMILIATING THE POOR GIRL
LIKE THAT ON HER WEDDING DAY?

01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:58.400
WHAT KIND OF VICIOUS...

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.760
GET AWAY FROM ME!

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.900
ON HER WEDDING DAY!

01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:04.900
AT THE ALTAR!

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:07.600
TO DO THAT TO THE
WOMAN YOU CLAIM TO LOVE...

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.300
I SWEAR IF I WAS A MAN
I WOULD EAT HIS HEART!

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:14.360
BUT WHY WOULD I WANT TO BE
A MAN? YOU'RE ALL THE SAME.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:18.260
HERE HE STANDS SPEWING OUT THIS
FILTH, THIS POISON AT HERO WHO'S

01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:21.830
NEVER HURT ANYONE IN HER ENTIRE
LIFE, AND WHAT DO YOU ALL DO?

01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:26.200
YOU BRAVE, HONORABLE MEN,
YOU JUST STAND THERE...

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:31.730
USELESS, LISTENING TO
THIS SLANDER, THESE LIES!

01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:36.260
DON'T YOU DARE WALK AWAY FROM
ME WHEN I'M SHOUTING AT YOU!

01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:46.930
I LOVE YOU, BEATRICE.

01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:52.000
AND I'M GOING TO MAKE
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT.

01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:07.100
AH, THERE YOU ARE.

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:09.500
I WONDER IF I
COULD HAVE A WORD.

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:12.160
I SWEAR, MR. BARRY, IF
YOU ASK TO SEE MY ID...

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.230
ACTUALLY, I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE
AN EXPLANATION FOR ALL THIS.

01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:17.560
IT'LL ONLY
TAKE A MINUTE.

01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:22.200
OH!

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:25.730
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LET'S
HEAR IT FOR THE BEST MAN.

01:16:25.730 --> 01:16:27.200
CLAUDE,
YOU'RE DRUNK.

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.100
I BLOODY HOPE SO.

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:34.260
THE BOSS IS PAYING - OR
SHOULD I SAY, EX-BOSS.

01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:37.230
IF YOU'RE HUNGRY, 250
PORTIONS OF SALMON...

01:16:37.230 --> 01:16:40.260
I NEED TO TALK
WITH YOU. ALONE.

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:43.660
FINE. I KNOW WHEN
I'M NOT WANTED.

01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:46.230
GOOD. YOU'RE NOT
WANTED, SO GO.

01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:49.960
NO, DON, YOU
STAY HERE. DON?

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:52.430
WHOA, WHAT YOU
GONNA DO, HIT ME?

01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:55.060
I AM TRYING
HARD NOT TO.

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:58.360
CLAUDE, YOU KNOW YOU'VE DONE
SOMETHING TERRIBLE, DON'T YOU?

01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:01.660
WELL, SEE, THAT, MY FRIEND,
IS A MATTER OF OPINION.

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:05.130
YOU'RE NOT MY FRIEND AND
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF OPINION.

01:17:05.130 --> 01:17:08.530
HE'S TRICKED YOU, CLAUDE.
HE'S MADE YOU LOOK A FOOL.

01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:10.430
WHO, DON?

01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:12.830
I DON'T THINK SO.
I'VE SEEN THE PROOF.

01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:14.830
WHAT PROOF, CLAUDE?

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:17.130
THE PHOTOS.

01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:19.360
HE STOLE THEM
FROM HERO'S ROOM.

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.830
MR. BARRY HERE
SAW HIM.

01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:24.360
THAT'S RIGHT. THE
NIGHT OF THE PARTY.

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:27.160
AND TEXT MESSAGES.

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.900
HE USED HER PHONE.

01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:32.900
HE'S BEEN BORROWING HER PHONE
AND TEXTING HIS OWN NUMBER!

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.860
WHAT ABOUT ON HER HEN NIGHT,
HOW DID HE GET HER PHONE THEN?

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:37.830
HE HAD HER
BAG, REMEMBER?

01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:39.760
HE GAVE IT TO HER IN THE
CORRIDOR. I SAW HIM.

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.930
YOU WERE THERE.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:48.060
NO, NO, THIS
IS RIDICULOUS.

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:52.760
I SAW HIM GO TO HER ROOM
LAST NIGHT. I WAS THERE.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.330
IN HER ROOM?

01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:56.800
NO, OUTSIDE,
BUT... I SAW...

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:59.860
YOU SAW WHAT YOU
WANTED TO SEE, CLAUDE.

01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:02.500
YOU SAW WHAT HE
TOLD YOU TO SEE.

01:18:09.130 --> 01:18:12.830
WHY WOULD HE
DO ALL THIS?

01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:15.860
JUST SO YOU KNOW, BEATRICE
IS BRINGING HER DOWN NOW.

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:19.960
HERO, OH, I'VE GOT
TO TALK TO HER.

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.400
NOT NOW, CLAUDE.

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.230
I NEED TO
SPEAK TO HER.

01:18:23.230 --> 01:18:24.500
NOT NOW.

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.360
NO, I NEED TO
SPEAK TO HER!

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.860
LET GO OF ME!

01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:30.230
YOU.

01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:32.660
I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU, DON.

01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:34.830
HERO, I THINK I
MIGHT HAVE MADE A...

01:18:34.830 --> 01:18:36.060
NOT NOW, CLAUDE.

01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.700
I NEED TO SAY...

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:39.960
I THINK YOU'VE SAID QUITE
ENOUGH ALREADY, DON'T YOU?

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.360
HE SHOWED ME PHOTOS...

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.460
I SAID SHUT UP!

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:49.300
IT'S HIM I WANT
TO TALK TO.

01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:53.160
ONE QUESTION.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:59.700
TELL ME WHY, DON, BECAUSE
I NEED TO UNDERSTAND.

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:06.260
WASN'T I KIND TO YOU?
AFFECTIONATE? A GOOD FRIEND?

01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:10.230
DIDN'T I LISTEN TO YOU TALK
ON AND ON INTO THE NIGHT?

01:19:10.230 --> 01:19:14.800
AND DIDN'T I TELL YOU THE
WAY I FELT ABOUT YOU?

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.100
WASN'T I HONEST?

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:25.200
SO TELL ME, WHY WOULD
YOU DO THIS TO ME, DON?

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:28.260
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:32.500
AND YOU
HUMILIATED ME.

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:38.760
AND I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
WHAT THAT FELT LIKE.

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:40.830
HERO, NO!

01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:44.930
I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU!

01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:47.530
SWEETHEART!

01:19:47.530 --> 01:19:51.460
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:53.660
OH!

01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:56.000
GIVE HER SOME AIR.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.160
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY,
I'M SO SORRY!

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:02.900
CALL AN AMBULANCE.

01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:36.530
HEY.

01:20:36.530 --> 01:20:38.000
I GOT YOU THIS.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.230
WHAT IS IT?

01:20:39.230 --> 01:20:40.700
COFFEE.

01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:42.330
MAYBE SOUP.

01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:46.200
THANKS, I
THINK I'LL PASS.

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:48.660
POOR OLD LEONARD.

01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:50.430
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:54.000
WAIT AND SEE WHAT
THE TESTS SAY.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.360
IT'S NOT GOOD, I'M AFRAID.

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:59.900
SHE'S STILL NOT CONSCIOUS.

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:02.360
THEY'LL DO MORE TESTS
IN THE MORNING.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:04.560
AND MAYBE OPERATE.

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.460
ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS
GO HOME AND SLEEP.

01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:13.500
THANKS PETE.

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:17.200
LET ME TAKE
YOU HOME.

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.500
I'M SORRY, BEN.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.460
WHAT FOR?

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:24.630
WE HAVE SOMETHING TO
TALK ABOUT, DON'T WE?

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:29.200
AND NOW DOESN'T REALLY
SEEM LIKE THE RIGHT TIME.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:32.260
IT CAN WAIT.

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:08.330
SO, HERE WE ARE.

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.130
I'M SORRY.

01:22:18.130 --> 01:22:25.060
I THOUGHT WHEN I SAW YOU IT
WOULD ALL COME FLOODING OUT,

01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:29.730
YOU KNOW? SOME SPECIAL
COMBINATION OF WORDS

01:22:29.730 --> 01:22:35.830
TO TELL YOU HOW
SORRY I AM.

01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:39.160
AND HOW MUCH
I LOVE YOU.

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:42.900
AND MISS YOU.

01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:44.960
BUT THEY'RE NOT MY
STRONG POINT, ARE THEY?

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.660
WORDS.

01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:49.800
THEY WON'T DO WHAT
I WANT THEM TO.

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:58.460
SO I'LL JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT
I WOULD HAPPILY GIVE MY LIFE

01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:03.530
RIGHT NOW IF YOU'LL JUST OPEN
YOUR EYES AND SAY SOMETHING.

01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:07.400
ANYTHING - EVEN IF IT'S TO
SAY THAT YOU HATE ME.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:11.330
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
HERO, I REALLY DON'T KNOW

01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:13.900
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:17.530
SORRY, BUT I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:20.660
IMMEDIATELY, PLEASE.

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.500
I'M SORRY.

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:57.600
(BEEPING SOUND)

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.560
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:03.130
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:05.700
NO! HERO!

01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:07.560
YOU CAN'T
COME IN HERE.

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:11.030
I NEED TO SEE HER!

01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:16.660
CLAUDE! WHO ARE
ALL THESE PEOPLE?

01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:32.260
EXCUSE ME, IS THERE
ANYONE SITTING HERE?

01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:35.160
WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M
WAITING FOR A FRIEND.

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:38.830
WILL HE MIND IF I SIT
DOWN WHILE YOU WAIT?

01:24:46.930 --> 01:24:49.330
SO, AM I LATE?

01:24:49.330 --> 01:24:52.330
ONLY ABOUT
THREE YEARS.

01:24:59.630 --> 01:25:02.630
I'VE BEEN OFFERED
A JOB IN LONDON.

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:05.300
IT'S JUST A PRODUCTION
JOB TO BEGIN WITH.

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:07.460
MAYBE GET ON
SCREEN SOON.

01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:09.960
ARE YOU GOING
TO TAKE IT?

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:13.060
I DON'T KNOW.

01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:18.030
IT'S A BIG STEP,
MOVING AWAY.

01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:23.060
I THINK YOU
SHOULD GO.

01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:26.200
CLAUDE, IF YOU'RE
EXPECTING ME TO FORGIVE YOU

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.960
YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TIME.

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:31.930
BUT I ONLY DID IT
BECAUSE I LOVED YOU.

01:25:31.930 --> 01:25:35.430
FUNNY, THAT'S
WHAT DON SAID.

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:40.430
I'M SO BORED OF PEOPLE
USING LOVE AS AN EXCUSE.

01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:47.200
THAT'S NOT LOVE ANYWAY,
THAT'S JUST POSSESSION,

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:52.360
AND I'M BORED OF BEING
OWNED TOO, BY YOU, BY MY DAD.

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:57.430
I'M JUST GOING TO LOOK
AFTER MYSELF FOR A WHILE.

01:25:57.430 --> 01:26:02.200
THINK THINGS THROUGH.

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:10.260
WHEN YOU'VE HAD SOME TIME,
MAYBE YOU WOULD THINK ABOUT

01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:13.560
CARRYING ON
WHERE WE LEFT OFF?

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:16.560
WHAT, GET MARRIED?
TO YOU?

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.830
NEVER IN A
MILLION YEARS.

01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:22.730
OKAY, MAYBE NOT IN
THE SHORT TERM, BUT...

01:26:22.730 --> 01:26:27.730
SOME TIME IN THE
FUTURE PERHAPS?

01:26:27.730 --> 01:26:33.360
JUST SAY I CAN HOPE,
HERO, PLEASE?

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.800
PLEASE?

01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:59.230
"LET ME NOT TO THE MARRIAGE
OF TRUE MINDS ADMIT TO, UH.

01:26:59.230 --> 01:27:05.660
LET ME NOT TO THE MARRIAGE OF
TRUE MINDS ADMIT IMPEDIMENTS.

01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:08.230
HEY, COME ON!
EVERYONE'S WAITING.

01:27:08.230 --> 01:27:10.460
HERE, YOU LOOK GOOD.

01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:12.160
ALL RIGHT?

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.730
YEAH.

01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:15.900
NOSTRIL HAIR?

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:17.760
NO, IT'S FINE.

01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:24.730
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHAT
CONFETTI ACTUALLY COSTS?

01:27:24.730 --> 01:27:27.900
I SWEAR IT'D BE CHEAPER
TO THROW CASH.

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:29.660
LOOK AT THESE FLOWERS.

01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:32.000
YOU SEE THEM FOR,
WHAT, 20 MINUTES?

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.030
THEN CHUCK 'EM OUT.

01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:37.030
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE RIGHT
NOW THERE'S A FLORIST

01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:39.360
AND A CATERER HAVING
A BLOODY GOOD LAUGH.

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:42.530
SHUT UP, WILL YOU? YOU'RE
MAKING ME NERVOUS.

01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:51.500
(MUSIC STARTS)

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.160
WRONG SIDE.

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:58.230
