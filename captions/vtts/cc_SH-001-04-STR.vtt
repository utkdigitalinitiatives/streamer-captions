00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800


2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.270
This many then shall die.

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.530
Their names are prick'd.

4
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.730
Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?

5
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.400
I do consent--

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.800
Prick him down, Antony.

7
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.170
Upon condition Publius shall not live,

8
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.830
who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.

9
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.830
He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.

10
00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.600
But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house, fetch the will hither,

11
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.730
and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies.

12
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.200
What, shall I find you here?

13
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.500
Or here, or at the Capitol.

14
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:40.330
This is a slight unmeritable man, meet to be sent on errands.

15
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.870
Is it fit, the three-fold world divided,

16
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.070
he should stand one of the three to share it?

17
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.300
So you thought him,

18
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.500
and took his voice who should be prick'd to die

19
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.330
in our black sentence and proscription.

20
00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.130
Octavius, I have seen more days than you,

21
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.400
and though we lay these honors on this man

22
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.700
to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,

23
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.900
he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,

24
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.200
to groan and sweat under the business,

25
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.070
either led or driven, as we point the way;

26
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.000
and having brought our treasure where we will,

27
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.600
then take we down his load and turn him off,

28
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.400
like to the empty ass, to shake his ears and graze in commons.

29
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.000
You may do your will, but he's a tried and valiant soldier.

30
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.000
So is my horse, Octavius,

31
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and for that I do appoint him store of provender?

32
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.370
It is a creature that I teach to fight, to wind,

33
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.170
to stop, to run directly on,

34
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.700
and, in some taste, is Lepidus but so:

35
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.230
he must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth;

36
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.900
a barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds on objects, arts,

37
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.330
and imitations, which, out of use and staled by other men,

38
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.400
begin his fashion.

39
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.970
Do not talk of him but as a property.

40
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.170
Now, Octavius...

41
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.600
listen great things.

42
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.500
Brutus and Cassius are levying powers;

43
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.870
we must straight make head;

44
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.500
therefore let our alliance be combined,

45
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.370
our best friends made, our means stretch'd;

46
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.100
and let us presently go sit in council,

47
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.570
how covert matters may be best disclosed,

48
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.730
and open perils surest answered.

49
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.400
Let us do so, for we are at the stake,

50
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.070
and bay'd about with many enemies;

51
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.330
and some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,

52
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.130
millions of mischiefs.

53
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.300
What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?

54
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.070
He is at hand,

55
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.530
and Pindarus is come to do you salutation from his master.

56
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.970
He greets me well.

57
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.500
Your master, Pindarus, in his own change, or by ill officers,

58
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.870
hath given me some worthy cause to wish things done undone;

59
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.830
but if he be at hand, I shall be satisfied.

60
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.700
I do not doubt but that my noble master

61
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.570
will appear such as he is, full of regard and honor.

62
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.200
He is not doubted.

63
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.800
A word, Lucilius.

64
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.100
How he received you?

65
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.400
Let me be resolved.

66
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.770
With courtesy and with respect enough,

67
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.670
but not with such familiar instances,

68
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.400
nor with such free and friendly conference,

69
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.670
as he hath used of old.

70
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.070
Thou hast described a hot friend cooling.

71
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.600
Ever note, Lucilius, when love begins to sicken and decay

72
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.700
it useth an enforced ceremony.

73
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.370
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;

74
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.330
but hollow men, like horses hot at hand,

75
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.430
make gallant show and promise of their mettle;

76
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.100
but when they should endure the bloody spur,

77
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.430
they fall their crests and like deceitful jades

78
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.030
sink in the trial.

79
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.670
Comes his army on?

80
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.330
They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter'd;

81
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.600
the greater part, the horse in general,

82
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.300
are come with Cassius.

83
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.830
Hark, he is arrived.

84
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.600
March gently on to meet him.

85
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.800
Stand, ho.

86
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.030
Speak the word along.

87
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.100
Stand ho!

88
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.500
Stand ho!

89
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.630
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.

90
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.030
Judge me, you gods.

91
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.770
Wrong I mine enemies?

92
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.400
And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?

93
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.470
Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,

94
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.730
and when you do them--

95
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.000
Cassius, be content, speak your griefs softly,

96
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.500
I do know you well.

97
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.130
Before the eyes of both our armies here,

98
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.570
which should perceive nothing but love from us,

99
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.800
let us not wrangle.

100
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.800
Bid them move away; then in my tent, Cassius,

101
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.000
enlarge your griefs, and I will give you audience.

102
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.430
Pindarus, bid our commanders lead their charges

103
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.070
off a little from this ground.

104
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.530
Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man come to our tent

105
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.500
till we have done our conference.

106
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.030
Lucius and Titinius, guard our door.

107
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.070
That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:

108
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.100
you have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella

109
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.900
for taking bribes here of the Sardians,

110
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.070
wherein my letters, praying on his side,

111
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.870
because I knew the man, were slighted off.

112
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.400
You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.

113
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.270
In such a time as this it is not meet

114
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.570
that every nice offense should bear his comment.

115
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.430
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself are much condemn'd

116
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.230
to have an itching palm,

117
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.030
to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers.

118
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.730
I an itching palm?

119
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.270
You know that you are Brutus that speaks this,

120
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.230
or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.

121
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.600
The name of Cassius honors this corruption,

122
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.630
and chastisement doth therefore hide his head.

123
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.900
Chastisement?

124
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.370
Remember March, the ides of March remember.

125
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.830
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?

126
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.070
What villain touch'd his body,

127
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.000
that did stab, and not for justice?

128
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.400
What, shall one of us,

129
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.600
that struck the foremost man of all this world

130
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.200
but for supporting robbers,

131
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.170
shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes

132
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.530
and sell the mighty space of our large honors

133
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.000
for so much trash as may be grasped thus?

134
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.970
By the gods, I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,

135
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.630
than such a Roman.

136
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.430
Brutus, bait not me, I'll not endure it.

137
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.930
You forget yourself to hedge me in.

138
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.770
I am a soldier, I, older in practice,

139
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.430
abler than yourself to make conditions.

140
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.870
Go to, you are not, Cassius.

141
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.030
I am.

142
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.870
I say you are not.

143
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.030
Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;

144
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.200
have mind upon your health, tempt me no farther.

145
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.900
Away, slight man.

146
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.330
Is't possible?

147
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.770
Hear me, for I will speak.

148
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.430
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?

149
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.530
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?

150
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.200
O gods, ye gods!

151
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.600
Must I endure all this?

152
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.700
All this?

153
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.300
Ay, more!

154
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.030
Fret till your proud heart break.

155
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.270
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,

156
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.930
and make your bondmen tremble.

157
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.030
Must I bouge?

158
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.630
Must I observe you?

159
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.000
Must I stand and crouch under your testy humor?

160
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.800
By the gods, you shall digest the venom of your spleen,

161
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.430
though it do split you, for, from this day forth,

162
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:03.030
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,

163
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.630
when you are waspish.

164
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:05.970
Is it come to this?

165
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.400
You say you are the better soldier:

166
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.130
let it appear so, make your vaunting true,

167
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.130
and it shall please me well.

168
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.100
For mine own part, I shall be glad to learn of noble men.

169
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.430
You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.

170
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.100
I said, an elder soldier, not a better.

171
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.370
Did I say "better"?

172
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.430
If you did, I care not.

173
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.230
When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.

174
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:31.370
Peace, peace.

175
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.900
You durst not so have tempted him.

176
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.770
I durst not?

177
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.630
No.

178
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.570
What, durst not tempt him?

179
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.400
For your life you durst not.

180
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.230
Do not presume too much upon my love;

181
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.800
I may do that I shall be sorry for.

182
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.630
You have done that you should be sorry for.

183
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.000
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,

184
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.470
for I am arm'd so strong in honesty,

185
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.730
that they pass by me as the idle wind

186
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.400
which I respect not.

187
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.330
I did send to you for certain sums of gold,

188
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.470
which you denied me, for I can raise no money by vile means.

189
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.230
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart

190
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.870
and drop my blood for drachmas

191
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.600
than to wring from the hard hands of peasants

192
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.270
their vile trash by any indirection.

193
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.300
I did send to you for gold to pay my legions,

194
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.630
which you denied me.

195
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.030
Was that done like Cassius?

196
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.500
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?

197
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.570
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous

198
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.630
to lock such rascal counters from his friends,

199
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.570
be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,

200
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.800
Dash him to pieces.

201
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.900
I denied you not.

202
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.000
You did!

203
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.970
I did not!

204
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.000
He was but a fool that brought my answer back.

205
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.570
Brutus hath rived my heart.

206
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.030
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,

207
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.170
but Brutus makes mine greater than they are.

208
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.130
I do not, till you practise them on me.

209
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.600
You love me not.

210
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.800
I do not like your faults.

211
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.100
A friendly eye could never see such faults.

212
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.270
A flatterer's would not,

213
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.770
though they do appear as huge as high Olympus.

214
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.400
Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,

215
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.430
revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,

216
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.870
for Cassius is aweary of the world:

217
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.100
hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;

218
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.730
check'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,

219
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.030
set in a notebook, learn'd and conn'd by rote,

220
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.800
to cast into my teeth.

221
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.730
O, I could weep my spirit from mine eyes!

222
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.300
There is my dagger, and here my naked breast;

223
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.930
within, a heart dearer than Pluto's mine, richer than gold.

224
00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:44.230
If that thou beest a Roman, take it forth;

225
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.470
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart.

226
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:51.430
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar!

227
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.570
For I know, when thou didst hate him worst,

228
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.170
thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst Cassius.

229
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.600
Sheathe your dagger.

230
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.500
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;

231
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.030
do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.

232
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.770
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb,

233
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.600
that carries anger as the flint bears fire,

234
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.900
who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark

235
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.000
and straight is cold again.

236
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.800
Hath Cassius lived

237
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.270
to be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,

238
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:45.100
when grief and blood ill-temper'd vexeth him?

239
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.230
When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.

240
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.870
Do you confess so much?

241
00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.570
Give me your hand.

242
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.770
And my heart too.

243
00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.930
O Brutus.

244
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.530
What's the matter?

245
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.370
Have not you love enough to bear with me

246
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.030
when that rash humor which my mother gave me

247
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.370
makes me forgetful?

248
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:26.000
Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,

249
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.870
when you are overearnest with your Brutus,

250
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.830
he'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.

251
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.700
Let me go in to see the generals.

252
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.170
There is some grudge between 'em,

253
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.330
'tis not meet they be alone.

254
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.430
You shall not come to them.

255
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.330
Nothing but death shall stay me.

256
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.970
How now, what's the matter?

257
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.270
For shame, you generals.

258
00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.530
What do you mean?

259
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:49.770
Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;

260
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.830
for I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.

261
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.800
How vilely doth this cynic rhyme.

262
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.500
Get you hence, saucy fellow, hence.

263
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.700
Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.

264
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.370
I'll know his humor when he knows his time.

265
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.530
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?

266
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:09.130
Companion, hence.

267
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.630
Away, away, be gone.

268
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.200
Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders

269
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.530
prepare to lodge their companies tonight.

270
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:16.730
And come yourselves

271
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.830
and bring Messala with you immediately to us.

272
00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.030
Lucius, a bowl of wine.

273
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.630
I did not think you could have been so angry.

274
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.230
O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.

275
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.770
Of your philosophy you make no use,

276
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.630
if you give place to accidental evils.

277
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.570
No one bears sorrow better.

278
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.100
Portia is dead.

279
00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.430
Portia?

280
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:02.870
She is dead.

281
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.630
How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?

282
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:16.570
O insupportable and touching loss.

283
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.670
Upon what sickness?

284
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:23.500
Impatient of my absence, and grief that young Octavius

285
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.030
with Mark Antony have made themselves so strong--

286
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.500
for with her death that tidings came--

287
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:35.400
with this she fell distract, and, her attendants absent,

288
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.670
swallow'd fire.

289
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.070
And died so?

290
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.070
Even so.

291
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.500
O ye immortal gods.

292
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.170
Speak no more of her.

293
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.530
Give me a bowl of wine.

294
00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:04.400
In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.

295
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.330
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.

296
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:12.600
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;

297
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.770
I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.

298
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:20.770
Come in, Titinius.

299
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.770
Welcome, good Messala.

300
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:25.270
Now sit we close about this taper here,

301
00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.970
and call in question our necessities.

302
00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.330
Portia, art thou gone?

303
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.270
No more, I pray you.

304
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.500
Messala, I have here received letters that young Octavius

305
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.100
with Mark Antony come down upon us with a mighty power,

306
00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.870
bending their expedition toward Philippi.

307
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:48.870
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.

308
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.030
With what addition?

309
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.930
That by proscription and bills of outlawry

310
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.900
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus

311
00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.930
have put to death an hundred senators.

312
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.300
Therein our letters do not well agree;

313
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.400
mine speak of seventy senators

314
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.070
that died by their proscriptions, Cicero being one.

315
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.400
Cicero one?

316
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.770
Cicero is dead, and by that order of proscription.

317
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.670
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?

318
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.500
No, Messala.

319
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.870
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?

320
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.330
Nothing, Messala.

321
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:23.670
That, methinks, is strange.

322
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.130
Why ask you?

323
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.700
Hear you aught of her in yours?

324
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.270
No, my lord.

325
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.800
Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.

326
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.130
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:

327
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.430
for certain she is dead, and by strange manner.

328
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.170
Why, farewell, Portia.

329
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.370
We must die, Messala.

330
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.300
With meditating that she must die once

331
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.270
I have the patience to endure it now.

332
00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:09.870
Even so great men great losses should endure.

333
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:12.670
I have as much of this in art as you,

334
00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.930
but yet my nature could not bear it so.

335
00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.900
Well, to our work alive.

336
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.130
What do you think of marching to Philippi presently?

337
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:22.230
I do not think it good.

338
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.370
Your reason?

339
00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:26.300
This it is: 'tis better the enemy seek us;

340
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.130
so shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,

341
00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.970
doing himself offense, whilst we lying still are full of rest,

342
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.600
defense, and nimbleness.

343
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.270
Good reasons must of force give place to better.

344
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.030
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground

345
00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.670
do stand but in a forced affection,

346
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:42.370
for they have grudged us contribution.

347
00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.270
The enemy, marching along by them,

348
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.370
by them shall make a fuller number up,

349
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.630
come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;

350
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.230
from which advantage shall we cut him off

351
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.370
if at Philippi we do face him there,

352
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.570
these people at our back.

353
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.170
- Hear me, good brother. - Under your pardon.

354
00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.570
You must note beside

355
00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.300
that we have tried the utmost of our friends,

356
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.800
our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:

357
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.800
the enemy increaseth every day;

358
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.670
we, at the height, are ready to decline.

359
00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.600
There is a tide in the affairs of men

360
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.830
which taken at the flood leads on to fortune;

361
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:19.170
omitted, all the voyage of their life

362
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:23.770
is bound in shallows and in miseries.

363
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:27.070
On such a full sea are we now afloat,

364
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.570
and we must take the current when it serves,

365
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.430
or lose our ventures.

366
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.670
Then, with your will, go on;

367
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:48.370
we'll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi.

368
00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:50.770
The deep of night is crept upon our talk,

369
00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.730
and nature must obey necessity,

370
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.730
which we will niggard with a little rest.

371
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.070
There is no more to say?

372
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.330
No more.

373
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:03.900
Good night.

374
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.370
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.

375
00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.430
Farewell, good Messala; good night, Titinius;

376
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:10.670
Good night, lord Brutus.

377
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.200
Good night, Lord Brutus.

378
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:26.530
Noble, noble Cassius, good night and good repose.

379
00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:37.470
O my dear brother.

380
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.370
This was an ill beginning of the night.

381
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.470
Never come such division 'tween our souls.

382
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.000
Let it not, Brutus.

383
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.830
Everything is well.

384
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.930
Good night, my lord.

385
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.930
Good night, good brother.

386
00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.070
Give me the gown.

387
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.600
Where is thy instrument?

388
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.830
Here in the tent.

389
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.330
What, thou speak'st drowsily?

390
00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:18.530
Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o'erwatch'd.

391
00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:22.130
Call Claudius and some other of my men,

392
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.630
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.

393
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.800
Varro and Claudius.

394
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.300
Calls my lord?

395
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.430
I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;

396
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.170
it may be I shall raise you by and by

397
00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.070
on business to my brother Cassius.

398
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.830
So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.

399
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.230
I will not have it so.

400
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.900
Lie down, good sirs.

401
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.130
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.

402
00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.530
Look Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;

403
00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.130
I put it in the pocket of my gown.

404
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.130
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.

405
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:20.870
Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.

406
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.900
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,

407
00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.000
and touch thy instrument a strain or two?

408
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.670
Ay, my lord, an't please you.

409
00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.370
It does, my boy.

410
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.670
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.

411
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:34.800
It is my duty, sir.

412
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.030
I should not urge thy duty past thy might;

413
00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.130
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.

414
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.870
I have slept, my lord, already.

415
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:46.170
It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;

416
00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.030
I will not hold thee long.

417
00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:03.170
If I do live, I will be good to thee.

418
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.570
This is a sleepy tune.

419
00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:31.530
O murtherous slumber,

420
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:36.270
layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy that plays thee music?

421
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.100
Gentle knave, good night.

422
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.900
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.

423
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:52.470
If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;

424
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.400
I'll take it from thee.

425
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:07.100
And, good boy, good night.

426
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.270
Let me see, let me see;

427
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:24.900
is not the leaf turn'd down where I left reading?

428
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.770
Here it is, I think.

429
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.130
How ill this taper burns.

430
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.570
Who comes here?

431
00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.900
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes

432
00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:52.200
that shapes this monstrous apparition.

433
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.670
It comes upon me.

434
00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:59.800
Art thou anything?

435
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:04.930
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil

436
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:10.700
that makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?

437
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.200
Speak to me what thou art.

438
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.600
Thy evil spirit, Brutus.

439
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.330
Why comest thou?

440
00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.130
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.

441
00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:25.030
Well, then I shall see thee again?

442
00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:27.730
Ay, at Philippi.

443
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:31.300
Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.

444
00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:40.100
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest.

445
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:45.630
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.

446
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.070
Boy. Lucius.

447
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:51.400
Varro. Claudius.

448
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.530
Sirs, awake.

449
00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:53.670
Claudius!

450
00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:55.430
The strings, my lord, are false.

451
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:56.600
He thinks he still is at his instrument.

452
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.700
Lucius, awake.

453
00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.870
My lord?

454
00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.000
Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?

455
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.870
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.

456
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:04.030
Yes, that thou didst.

457
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:05.200
Didst thou see anything?

458
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.670
Nothing, my lord.

459
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.930
Sleep again, Lucius.

460
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.100
Sirrah Claudius.

461
00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.670
Fellow thou, awake.

462
00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:14.970
My lord?

463
00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:16.170
My lord?

464
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.170
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?

465
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:19.700
- Did we, my lord? - Did we, my lord?

466
00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.530
Ay, saw you anything?

467
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.600
No, my lord, I saw nothing.

468
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.230
Nor I, my lord.

469
00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:33.230
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;

470
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:38.630
bid him set on his powers betimes before,

471
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.000
and we will follow.

472
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.530
It shall be done, my lord.

473
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:54.770
