PEOPLE LIKE TO LOOK AT
THE INSTANT GEOLOGY,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
THE VOLCANOES GOING
UP AND SPEWING ASH.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
WE'RE BUILDING MOUNTAINS
AND ERODING THEM

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
AND MAKING DEEP BASINS.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
THIS IS WHERE ALL
THE ACTION HAPPENS.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
THE EARTH IS A VERY
DYNAMIC STRUCTURE,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
CONSTANTLY UNDERGOING
PROCESSES OF CHANGE.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
GEOLOGISTS HAVE SEARCHED
THE GLOBE FOR CLUES

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE
PROCESSES THAT DIRECTLY

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
OR INDIRECTLY RESULT
IN SOME OF THE MOST

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
SPECTACULAR SCENERY
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
THE SCIENCE AS WE DEFINE
IT NOW AS REALLY BEEN

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
THROUGH A BIG REVOLUTION
WOULD BE DEVELOPMENT OF

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
THE PLATE TECTONIC
THEORY THAT EXPLAINS,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
TO FIRST ORDER, HOW
THINGS LIKE EARTHQUAKES

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
AND VOANOES AND
MOUNTAIN-BUILDING ALL OCCUR.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
PLATE TECTONICS IS THE
THEORY THAT EARTH'S

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
OUTER LAYER IS MADE UP OF
PLATES WHICH HAVE MOVED

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
THROUGHOUT
EARTH'S HISTORY.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
TECTONICS COMES FROM
THE GREEK WORD FOR

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
"ONE WHO CONSTRUCTS".

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
PLATE TECTONICS AND THE
MOVEMENT OF THE PLATES

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
ON THE SURFACE OF THE
EARTH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
THE NOW RECOGNIZABLE
SHAPES THAT WE

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
ASSOCIATE WITH
THE CONTINENTS

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
AND WITH CERTAIN
AREAS OF THE PLANET.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
OF COURSE THEY WEREN'T ALWAYS
IN THIS CONFIGURATION.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
WAY BACK WHEN WHEN
THERE WAS PANGEA -

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS
ONE UNIFIED LAND MASS.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
ABOUT 250 MILLION YEARS
AGO OUR EARTH HAD

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
ONE SINGLE GIANT LAND
MASS CALLED PANGEA,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
MEANING ALL LANDS, AND
THIS SUPER CONTINENT

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
BROKE UP TO CREATE THE
MODERN DAY CONTINENTS.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
THIS THEORY CALLED
"CONTINENTAL DRIFT"

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
IS THE FORERUNNER
TO PLATE TECTONICS.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
A VERY ASTUTE SCIENTIST, A
METEOROLOGIST BY THE NAME

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
OF ALFRED WEGENER, ROUGHLY
BACK ABOUT 1915 OR SO,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
WAS REALLY THE FIRST GUY
TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
AND WHAT HE FOUND WAS A
LOT OF VERY COMPELLING

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE
THAT SUGGESTED THAT

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
THE CONTINENTS HAD
ONE TIME BEEN JOINED

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
AND THEY SINCE
HAD DRIFTED APART.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
HENCE THE TERM
"CONTINENTAL DRIFT".

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
AND HE FOUND FOUR VERY
COMPELLING LINES OF EVIDENCE.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
HE FOUND THAT THE CONTINENTS
SHARED COMMON COASTLINES.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
MUCH LIKE A PUZZLE YOU
COULD PUT THESE THINGS

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
BACK TOGETHER.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
AND THEN THERE WERE MANY
DETAILS OF THOSE CONTINENTS

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
THAT WERE KNOWN
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
IN THE EARLY 1900'S THAT
SUPPORTED THAT IDEA

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
OF THE FIT OF
THE CONTINENTS.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
THERE WERE FOSSILS THAT
WERE FOUND, FOR INSTANCE,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
IN AFRICA AND SOUTH
AMERICA THAT WERE

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
FROM EARLY REPTILES
THAT COULD NOT HAVE

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
SWUM ACROSS THE
ATLANTIC OCEAN.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
THERE WERE OLD MOUNTAIN
BELTS THAT ARE NO LONGER

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
MOUNTAINS, THEY'VE
BEEN ERODED DOWN,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
BUT WE SEE THE ROOTS OF
THEM IN SOUTH AMERICA.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
WE SEE THE ROOTS OF
DIFFERENT MOUNTAINS

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
IN NORTH AMERICA AND THOSE
MOUNTAINS PRESUMABLY

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
JUST GO OUT TO SEA,
BUT IN FACT

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
A MATCH FOR THOSE
MOUNTAINS IS FOUND

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE ATLANTIC.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
ALONG WITH FOSSILS OF
PLANTS AND ANIMALS AND THE

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
MOUNTAIN RANGES, WEGENER
FOUND OTHER EVIDENCE OF

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
SIMILAR GEOLOGICAL FEATURES
ON SEPARATED CONTINENTS

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
SUCH AS DEPOSITS
OF ICE AND COAL.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
THE PRESENCE OF GLACIAL
DEPOSITS AND COAL DEPOSITS

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
AS THEY STAND NOW ARE
VERY DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
BUT IF YOU REASSEMBLE THE
CONTINENTS INTO THIS BIG

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
LAND MASS THAT HE CALLED
"PANGEA", ALL OF A SUDDEN

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
THESE VERY MYSTERIOUS
GLACIAL DEPOSITS MAKE SENSE.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
DESPITE ALL THE EVIDENCE,
MANY SCIENTISTS

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
DURING WEGENER'S TIME
REJECTED THIS THEORY.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY COULD
NOT THINK OF ANY MECHANISM

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
WHEREBY THE CONTINENTS COULD
DRIFT AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
NOBODY COULD SEE HOW
THEY COULD PLOW THROUGH

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
THE OCEAN BASINS.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
AND SO BECAUSE NOBODY
COULD UNDERSTAND HOW

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
THAT COULD HAPPEN, THEY
THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
BUT IT DIDN'T
DIE COMPLETELY.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
IT WASN'T UNTIL
TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
DURING WWII THAT
ALLOWED PEOPLE

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
TO IMAGE THE
OCEAN BOTTOM AND

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF
EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
DID THIS NOTION OF
CONTINENTAL DRIFT RESURFACE.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
WHEN SUBMARINES WERE GOING
BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
OCEAN BASINS TRAILING
MAGNETOMETERS AS THEY WERE

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
LOOKING FOR ENEMY
SUBMARINES, THEY STARTED

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
TO NOTICE A PATTERN
OF MAGNETIC STRIPES

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
ON THE OCEAN FLOOR AND
THEY COULD ARGUE THAT

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
THE ROCKS ON THE SEA FLOOR
MUST HAVE CRYSTALLIZED

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
AT DIFFERENT POINTS
IN TIME BECAUSE

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
SOME OF THE LITTLE
MAGNETIC MINERALS IN THEM

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
WERE LINED UP POINTING TO
THE PRESENT DAY NORTH POLE

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
AND THEN YOU'D MOVE
SOME KILOMETERS AWAY

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
AND YOU'D GO ACROSS A BAND
OF ROCKS WHERE ALL THE

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
MAGNETIC MINERALS WERE
POINTING TO THE SOUTH POLE.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
WE KNOW NOW TODAY THAT
THESE STRIPED PATTERNS

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
REPRESENT WHAT ARE CALLED
"MAGNETIC REVERSALS".

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
ODDLY ENOUGH, THE EARTH
REVERSES ITS POLARITY.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
THAT IS, THE NORTH POLE
BECOMES THE SOUTH POLE

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
AND VICE VERSA
AND IT HAS DONE SO

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
RANDOMLY THROUGHOUT
EARTH'S GEOLOGIC PAST.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
WE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHY THIS HAPPENS,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
WE JUST KNOW
THAT IT DOES.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
IT'S BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED
IN ROCKS THROUGHOUT

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
THE GLOBE AND ROCKS
ON THE OCEAN BOTTOM.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
SO THESE MAGNETIC
STRIPES THAT WE SEE ARE

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
REPRESENTATIVE OF EARTH'S
CHANGING MAGNETIC FIELD -

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
THIS FLIPPING OF EARTH'S
MAGNETIC POLARITY.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
A BONUS TO THIS IS THAT
THE STRIPES ALSO WERE

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
PROOF POSITIVE OF
SEA FLOOR SPREADING.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
SEA FLOOR SPREADING IS
WHEN TWO PLATES MOVE AWAY

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
FROM EACH OTHER AND ALLOW
MAGMA TO RISE FROM

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
THE EARTH'S INTERIOR TO
CREATE NEW OCEAN FLOOR.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
AS THE MAGMA COOLS,
THE MAGNETIC MINERALS

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
CRYSTALLIZE WITHIN THE
ROCK AND ALIGN TO THE

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
THIS WAS THE
MISSING PIECE.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
AND THEN PEOPLE WERE ABLE
TO SAY WELL, MAYBE NEW

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
OCEANIC CRUST, NEW SEA
FLOOR IS BEING PRODUCED

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
IN THE CENTER OF THE OCEAN
AND MOVING AWAY FROM

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
THE CENTRAL PORTION AND
RECORDING THE EARTH'S

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
MAGNETIC FIELD AS IT
CRYSTALLIZES AND MOVES.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
AND IF THE OCEAN FLOOR IS
MOVING, MAYBE THE CONTINENTS

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
ARE ATTACHED TO THAT AND
THEY'RE MOVING AS WELL.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
SO IT WAS CONTINENTAL DRIFT
PLUS SEA FLOOR SPREADING

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
THAT GAVE RISE
TO THE MODERN THEORY

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
OF PLATE TECTONICS.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
EARTH'S CRUST IS DIVIDED
INTO SEVERAL SEPARATE

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
SOLID PLATES THAT FLOAT
AROUND INDEPENDENTLY

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
ON TOP OF THE HOT
MANTLE BELOW.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
IF WE LOOK AT THE EARTH,
WE CAN LOOK AT IT...

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
LET'S CALL IT THE
ANATOMY OF THE EARTH.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
WE CAN LOOK AT IT IN
TWO DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
WE CAN LOOK AT THE
COMPOSITIONAL LAYERS

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
OF THE EARTH WHICH INCLUDE
THE CRUST, THE MANTLE,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
AND THE CORE.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
THEN WE CAN LOOK AT
THE MECHANICAL LAYERS

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
OF THE EARTH AND,
BY MECHANICAL I MEAN

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
HOW STRONG
THAT MATERIAL IS.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
AN EXAMPLE I LIKE TO
USE IS A WAX CANDLE

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
AT ROOM TEMPERATURE IS
BRITTLE AND PRETTY STRONG.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT
OF FORCE TO SNAP IT.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
BUT IF YOU HEAT A CANDLE
UP IT BECOMES MUSHY

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
AND SOFT AND IS NOT
PARTICULARLY STRONG.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
IT BECOMES WEAK, RIGHT?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
IF WE LOOK AT EARTH'S
STRUCTURE, ITS ANATOMY,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
BASED ON THE MECHANICAL
STRENGTH OF EARTH'S

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
INTERNAL AREA, THIS
IS WHAT WE FIND:

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
WE FIND THAT THE CRUST
IN THE UPPER PART

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
OF THE MANTLE FORM
A RIGID OUTER SHELL

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
THAT WE CALL
A LITHOSPHERE.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
IT'S ABOUT 100
KILOMETERS THICK.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
BENEATH THAT WE HAVE A
MUSHY LAYER, A WEAK LAYER,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
THAT IS MADE OF PARTIALLY
MOLTEN MANTLE MATERIAL

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
CALLED THE ASTHENOSPHERE.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
THESE TWO LAYERS ARE
THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
IN THE MECHANICS OF
PLATE TECTONICS,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
SO THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT
PLAYERS IN THIS STORY.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
THE LITHOSPHERE, THIS
RIGID OUTER SHELL,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
ALMOST FLOATS, IF YOU WILL,
ON THE ASTHENOSPHERE

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
AND SLIDES ABOUT
THE ASTHENOSPHERE.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
THE LITHOSPHERE IS WHAT
MAKES UP THE PLATES

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
OF PLATE TECTONICS.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
IF WE BREAK THE LITHOSPHERE
UP INTO DIFFERENT PLATES,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
THOSE PLATES WILL THEN SLIDE
ABOUT ON THIS ASTHENOSPHERE

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
AND INTERACT IN A
VARIETY OF WAYS.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
THEY'LL BUMP INTO EACH
OTHER, THEY'LL MOVE AWAY

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
FROM EACH OTHER, AND
THEY'LL SLIDE SIDE BY SIDE.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
AND PEOPLE ARGUE ABOUT
WHICH ARE THE MAJOR PLATES,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
BUT THERE'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
8, 10, 12 MAJOR PLATES

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
AND THEN A NUMBER
OF SMALLER PIECES -

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
WHAT WE MIGHT
CALL MICROPLATES.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
AND PLACES WHERE A BIG STABLE
PLATE IS IN THE PROCESS

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
OF TRYING TO BREAK UP AND
MAKE A NEW MICROPLATE.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
SOME OF THE MAJOR
PLATES ARE:

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL
OTHER SMALLER PLATES,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
AND EVEN MICROPLATES
THAT TOGETHER WITH

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
THE MAJOR PLATES ARE
IN CONSTANT MOTION

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
AND CONTINUALLY CHANGING
IN SHAPE AND SIZE.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
PLATES EDGES MAY CONTAIN
EITHER OCEANIC CRUST

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
OR CONTINENTAL CRUST BUT
DON'T QUITE MATCH UP

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
TO THE CONTINENTS
AND OCEANS.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
IF WE THEN LOOK AT A PLATE
OF PLATE TECTONICS

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
WE'LL NOTICE THAT THIS
PLATE IS OFTEN COMPOSED OF

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
BOTH CONTINENTAL
AND OCEANIC CRUSTS.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
AN ANALOGY THAT'S HELPFUL
IS TO THINK OF A PIECE

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
OF BREAD THAT ACTS
AS THE UPPER MANTLE

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
AND THEN SPREADING SOME
PEANUT BUTTER ON ONE SIDE

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
AND SOME JELLY
ON THE OTHER.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
MAYBE THE JELLY'S
THE OCEANIC CRUST,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
THE PEANUT BUTTER'S
THE CONTINENTAL CRUST.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
BOTH OF THOSE CRUST TYPES
ARE RIDING ON THE BREAD.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
SO, COLLECTIVELY THAT'LL
MAKE UP AN ENTIRE PLATE.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
MANY FORCES CAUSE THE
SURFACE OF THE EARTH

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
TO CHANGE OVER TIME.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
HOWEVER, THE LARGEST
FORCE THAT CHANGES

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
OUR PLANET'S SURFACE
IS PLATE TECTONICS

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE
EARTH'S OUTER LAYER.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
IT IS THIS ONGOING PROCESS
THAT CAUSES MOUNTAINS

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
TO PUSH HIGHER AND
OCEANS TO GROW WIDER.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
WE HAVE THIS ALMOST
STILL FRAME OF THE EARTH

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
AS IT IS NOW BECAUSE WE'RE
LIVING IN A MILLISECOND

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
OF GEOLOGIC TIME SO WE
HAVE SEARED INTO OUR MINDS

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
WHAT THE EARTH
LOOKS LIKE BUT

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
WE FORGET THAT THE
PLATES ARE STILL MOVING

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS
GOING TO LOOK LIKE THIS.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
THE WHOLE EARTH IS
A DYNAMIC SYSTEM.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
THE REASON WE HAVE
EARTHQUAKES AND VOLCANOES

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
IS REALLY BECAUSE
THE EARTH'S PLATES

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
ARE STILL
MOVING AROUND.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IS
STILL GETTING BIGGER AND,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
TECHNICALLY, THE PACIFIC
IS STILL GETTING SMALLER.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
NOW, CAN YOU
MEASURE THAT?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING
AT AUT ONE CENTIMETER

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
A YEAR OF CHANGE.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
WE LIKE TO SAY IN GEOLOGY
THIS IS ABOUT AS FAST AS

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
YOUR FINGERNAILS GROW.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
IT'S A VERY SLOW RATE
BUT IT'S A HUGE MASS

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
OF THE EARTH'S CRUST THAT'S
MOVING THAT WAY AND SO

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
IT'S A VERY LARGE FORCE
MOVING ACROSS THE EARTH.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
WE CAN MEASURE MOVEMENT OF
THE PLATES IN MANY WAYS.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
WE CAN USE THE RECORD
OF THE MAGNETIC STRIPES

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
IN SEA FLOOR SPREADING,
BUT MOST OBVIOUSLY WE CAN

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
MEASURE THEIR MOTIONS
DIRECTLY THANKS TO GPS,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
THE GLOBAL
POSITIONING SYSTEM.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
THE GLOBAL POSITIONING
SYSTEM WHICH IS

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
BASED ON A SERIES OF
SATELLITES THAT ARE

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
POSITIONED IN
STATIC ORBIT.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
THEY GIVE PRECISE
LOCATIONS FOR YOUR LITTLE

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
HANDHELD GPS UNITS -
THE GPS IN YOUR CARS,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
THE GPS ON AIRLINES.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
IF SOMEONE HAS A GPS UNIT,
YOU CAN USE THAT UNIT AND

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
THE OVERHEAD SATELLITES
TO PINPOINT YOUR LOCATION

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
ON PLANET EARTH.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
IF YOU HAVE A GPS
UNIT ON ONE CONTINENT

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
AND YOU HAVE A GPS UNIT
ON ANOTHER CONTINENT

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
AND YOU'RE KEEPING TRACK
OF THEIR POSITION,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
YOU CAN SEE IN REAL TIME
- ALTHOUGH SLOWLY -

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
YOU CAN SEE IN
REAL TIME HOW

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
THOSE COINENTS
ARE MOVING AROUND.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
SO WE CAN ACTUALLY RECORD
THE CONTINENT'S LOCATIONS

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
DAY BY DAY AND YEAR BY
YEAR AND IT SHOWS THAT

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
THE CONTINENTS
ARE INDEED MOVING.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
WHAT'S STILL A QUESTION
IS THE EXACT MECHANICS

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
BEHIND PLATE TECTONICS.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
A LOT OF REALLY
GREAT IDEAS,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
SOME GREAT HYPOTHESES
THAT ARE OUT THERE,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
BUT WE STILL DON'T
KNOW CONCLUSIVELY

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
WHAT DRIVES THE PLATES.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
SOME OF THE FORCES THAT
ARE INVOLVED IN CREATING

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
THINGS LIKE VOLCANOES AND
EARTHQUAKES AND THE BIG

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
DISASTROUS THINGS
EVERYBODY ASSOCIATES

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
WITH GEOLOGY COME FROM
VERY DEEP INSIDE THE EARTH

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
WHERE IT'S MUCH, MUCH
HOTTER THAN IT IS AT THE

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
SURFACE OF THE EARTH AND
IT CAUSES THE INTERIOR

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
OF THE EARTH, EVEN THOUGH
IT'S MADE OF SOLID ROCK,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
IT'S HOT ENOUGH
THAT IT'S

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
VERY SQUISHY AND GOOEY
AND IT'S ABLE TO FLOW

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
IN RESPONSE TO THAT
TEMPERATURE GRADIENT.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
THIS IS CALLED
"CONVECTION" AND MANY

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
PEOPLE THINK IT'S THAT
CONVECTION IN THE INTERIOR

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
OF THE EARTH THAT DRIVES
MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH'S

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
TECTONIC PLATES AND IT'S
THE INTERACTIONS OF THOSE

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
PLATES WITH ONE ANOTHER,
SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
AND GRINDING
PAST EACH OTHER,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
THAT CAUSES EARTHQUAKES,
BUILDS LARGE MOUNTAINS,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
CREATES THE OCEAN BASINS,
MAKES VOLCANOES ERUPT,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
AND SO ON.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
THE HUGE MAJESTIC
MOUNTAINS OF THE WORLD

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
ARE BECAUSE
OF MOVING PLATES.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
WHEN TWO SECTIONS OF THE
EARTH'S LITHOSPHERE COLLIDE,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
THE SLABS PILE
INTO ONE ANOTHER

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
CAUSING "DEFORMATION"
OR FOLDING OF THE SLABS.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
THE HIMALAYAS ARE THE
RESULT OF INDIA SLAMMING UP

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
INTO WHAT WAS JUST THE
ASIAN PLATE AT THE TIME.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE BUT
THOSE DRAMATIC STRUCTURES

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
REALLY ARE FORMED
VERY SLOWLY.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
THEY SEEM LIKE THEY
WERE THE RESULT OF

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
A CATASTROPHIC COLLISION,
BUT THESE ARE THINGS

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
THAT HAPPEN
CENTIMETERS A YEAR.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
THE FACT THAT THE EARTH'S
CONTINENTS ARE NOT FIXED

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
IN PLACE BUT RATHER FLOAT
ON A SEA OF MOLTEN ROCK

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
MEANS THAT THEY MOVE
AROUND QUITE A BIT.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
THIS IS WHERE ALL
THE ACTION HAPPENS.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
THIS IS WHERE WE BUILD
MOUNTAINS, WE CREATE

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
VOLCANOES, AND WE HAVE
NUMEROUS EARTHQUAKES.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
BECAUSE THE TECTONIC
PLATES ARE ALWAYS MOVING

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
THEY END UP WITH DIFFERENT
POSITIONS WITH RESPECT TO

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
ONE ANOTHER AND DIFFERENT
KINDS OF BOUNDARIES.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
THERE ARE THREE MAJOR
TYPES OF PLATE BOUNDARIES:

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
DIVERGENT BOUNDARIES OCCUR
WHEN PLATES DIVIDE AND

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
PULL AWAY FROM EACH OTHER
AND NEW CRUST IS CREATED

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
LIKE IN SEA
FLOOR SPREADING.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
CONVERGENT BOUNDARIES
OCCUR WHEN THE CRUST

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
IS DESTROYED AS ONE PLATE
DIVES UNDER ANOTHER

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
IN A PROCESS KNOWN
AS SUBDUCTION.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
IN THIS PROCESS THE CRUST
IS OFTEN TURNED INTO MAGMA

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
WHERE IT CAN BE
RE-RELEASED BACK TO

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
THE SURFACE THROUGH
VOLCANIC ACTIVITY.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
ALMOST ALL THE CRUST
IS SOMEHOW IN SOME WAY

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
RECYCLED IN THESE PLATE
TECTONIC PROCESSES.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
AND THE WAY THAT HAPPENS
IS THAT, EVEN THOUGH WE

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
HAVE A LOT OF OCEAN CRUST
BEING FORMED, THERE'S ALSO

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
A LOT OF SUBDUCTION
OF CRUST GOING ON.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
SO IN THE OCEAN WE HAVE
THESE RIDGES THAT GO APART,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
WE ALSO HAVE PLACES
WHERE ONE PLATE IS

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
SUBDUCTING UNDERNEATH
THE OTHER AND ESSENTIALLY

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
RETURNING BACK
TO THE EARTH.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
IN TRANSFORM BOUNDARIES
CRUSIS NEITHER PRODUCED

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
NOR DESTROYED AND
THE PLATES JUST SLIDE

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
HORIZONTALLY
PAST ONE ANOTHER.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
MANY OF THE MOST
DEVASTATING GEOLOGICAL

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
EVENTS HAPPEN AT
PLATE BOUNDARIES.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
SO, FOR EXAMPLE,
EARTHQUAKES.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
WE FIND EARTHQUAKES
ASSOCIATED WITH

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
ALL THREE TYPES
OF PLATE BOUNDARIES.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
WE CAN HAVE PLATES THAT
PULL AWAY FROM EACH OTHER;

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
WE CAN HAVE PLATES
THAT SLAM TOGETHER;

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
AND WE CAN HAVE PLATES THAT
SLIDE PAST ONE ANOTHER.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
ALL OF THOSE TYPES OF
PLATE BOUNDARIES ARE

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
ASSOCIATED WITH
EARTHQUAKES AND MOST OF

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
THE EARTHQUAKES ON OUR
PLANET ARE LOCALIZED

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
ALONG THE PLATE
BOUNDARIES.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
THERE ARE A FEW ODDBALLS,
BUT MOST OF THEM

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
ARE ON THE PLATE
BOUNDARIES.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
IN MANY OF THESE
BOUNDARIES THERE IS

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
A LOT OF TENSION AND STRAIN
WHERE THE TWO PLATES

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
ARE SLIDING AND SCRAPING
PAST EACH OTHER.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
THE RESULTING STRAIN FROM
THE SLIDING ACTION OF THE

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
PLATES CAUSES CRACKS IN
THE CRUST CALLED "FAULTS".

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
AND FAULTS CAN BE VERY,
VERY SMALL OR THEY CAN BE

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
VERY LARGE LIKE THE SAN
ANDREAS FAULT IN CALIFORNIA.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
SOME FAULTS ARE VISIBLE ON
THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
BUT MANY FAULTS ARE NOT.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
MANY FAULTS ARE HIDDEN
BENEATH THE SURFACE

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
OF THE EARTH.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
REGARDLESS, WHEN FAULTS
MOVE, IF THEY'RE BIG ENOUGH,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
WHEN THOSE ROCKS FINALLY
SEPARATE AND MOVE,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
THEY CAN RELEASE AN
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
ELASTIC ENERGY - OF WHAT'S
CALLED "ELASTIC REBOUND"

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
AND THAT SHOCKWAVE
PRODUCED BY THOSE ROCKS

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
FINALLY SLIPPING AND
MOVING IS WHAT PRODUCES

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
AN EARTHQUAKE.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
IT'S A VERY
CATASTROPHIC EVENT.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
YOU RELEASE THAT ENERGY
ALL AT ONCE AND THE ENERGY

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
RADIATES THROUGHOUT
THE ENTIRE PLANET.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
BUT OBVIOUSLY IT HAS THE
MOST DEVASTATING EFFECTS

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
WHEN YOU'RE CLOSE TO WHAT'S
CALLED THE EPICENTER

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
- THE LOCATION WHERE
THAT ENERGY IS RELEASED.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
THE AREA WITHIN THE EARTH
WHERE THE EARTHQUAKE

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
ACTUALLY OCCURS, USUALLY
ALONG A FAULT THAT'S

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
SLIPPED WITHIN THE EARTH,
IS CALLED THE "FOCUS".

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
THE FIRST PLACE THOSE
ENERGY WAVES REACH THE

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
SURFACE OF THE EARTH, THE
FIRST PLACE THEY EMERGE

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
IS CALLED THE "EPICENTER".

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
SEISMIC VIBRATIONS, OR
WAVES, PRODUCED WHEN

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
THE GROUND
SUDDENLY RUPTURES

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
RADIATE OUT THROUGH
THE EARTH'S INTERIOR.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
THERE ARE MANY TYPES
OF EARTHQUAKE WAVES,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
BUT THE TWO MAIN ONES ARE:

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
"P" WAVES OR PRIMARY WAVES
TRAVEL SOMEWHAT FASTER -

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
ABOUT SIX KILOMETERS PER
SECOND - AND THEY CAUSE

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
WHAT'S CALLED A
COMPRESSIONAL WAVE.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
SOUND WAVES ARE
COMPRESSIONAL WAVES.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
AS MY VOCAL CHORDS VIBRATE
THEY'RE COMPRESSING

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
THE AIR AROUND THEM
CREATING SOUND.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
WHEN AN EARTHQUAKE OCCURS,
A SEISMOGRAPH STATION

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
WHICH IS AN INSTRUMENT
THAT RECORDS THE

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
EARTHQUAKE WAVES, THE
FIRST WAVE THAT WILL BE

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
RECORDED IS THE FASTEST
WAVE OR THE P-WAVE.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
THAT'S OFTEN WHY IT'S
CALLED A PRIMARY WAVE.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
THE SECOND WAVE
THAT WILL REACH

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
THE SEISMOGRAPH
STATION IS THE S-WAVE.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
S-WAVES, OR SHEAR WAVES,
MOVE RELATIVELY SLOW

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
- ABOUT FOUR
KILOMETERS PER SECOND -

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
AND THEY CAUSE A SHEARING
MOTION WITHIN THE ROCKS.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
AND WHAT'S HANDY ABOUT
THAT IS THAT THE LAG TIME,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
THAT IS THE TIME
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
ARRIVAL OF THE "P" AND
THE ARRIVAL OF THE "S",

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
CAN BE USED TO CALCULATE
HOW FAR THE EARTHQUAKE

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
OCCURRED AWAY FROM THAT
SEISMOGRAPH STATION.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
IF YOU HAVE THREE
SEISMOGRAPH STATIONS

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
AND YOU KNOW THE ARRIVAL
TIMES OF YOUR "S" AND "P"

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
AT EACH OF THOSE STATIONS,
YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
TRIANGULATE THE POSITION
OR THE EPICENTER

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
OF THE EARTHQUAKE.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
WE ASSOCIATE EARTHQUAKES
WITH DAMAGE CAUSED BY

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
TREMENDOUS GROUND-SHAKING.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF
UNDERWATER EARTHQUAKES,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
GIANT WAVES CALLED
"TSUNAMIS" CAN OCCUR.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
A TSUNAMI IS GENERATED WHEN
YOU HAVE AN EARTHQUAKE

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
ALONG A PLATE BOUNDARY
THAT IS UNDER WATER.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
SO IN THE CASE OF THE BIG
TSUNAMI GENERATED BY THE

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
SUMATRAN EARTHQUAKE,
WHAT HAPPENED WAS

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A
CONVERGENT PLATE BOUNDARY

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
WHERE ONE PLATE WAS
GRINDING DOWN UNDERNEATH

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
ANOTHER ONE AND WHEN
THAT EARTHQUAKE OCCURRED

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
THE UPPERMOST PLATE
MOVED VERY QUICKLY UP

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
AND SO ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'RE PUSHING ROCK

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
UP INTO AN AREA THAT
WAS OCCUPIED BY WATER

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
AND YOU CREATE
A GIANT WAVE.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
AND, SO, AS YOU MOVE ALL
THAT VOLUME OF WATER

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
IT'S LIKE
SLAPPING YOUR HAND

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
AGAINST THE SIDE
OF A BATHTUB.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
THE WATER HAS
TO GO SOMEWHERE

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
AND IT GENERATES WAVES
THAT SLOSH BACK AND FORTH

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
ACROSS THE OCEAN BASIN.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
AS WITH EARTHQUAKES,
VOLCANIC ACTIVITY OR

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
VOLCANISM IS LINKED TO
PLATE TECTONIC PROCESSES

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
AND PLATE BOUNDARIES, IN
THIS CASE A VENT IN THE

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
CRUST FROM WHICH USUALLY
MOLTEN OR HOT ROCK

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
AND STEAM ERUPTS THROUGH
THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
THERE ARE LITERALLY
THOUSANDS OF VOLCANOES

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
OF A SORT THAT WE DON'T
PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
BECAUSE THEY'RE
IN THE DEEP OCEANS

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
AND THEY FORM ALONG THE
DIVERGENT PLATE BOUNDARIES

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
OF THE SEA FLOOR
AND ARE SPREADING.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
AND THEY'RE LESS
IMPORTANT TO US.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
THEY'RE IMPORTANT
TO GEOLOGISTS FOR

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
UNDERSTANDING CERTAIN
PROCESSES, BUT THEY'RE

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
LESS IMPORTANT FOR US
BECAUSE THEY DON'T OCCUR

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
SO MUCH ON THE LAND.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
MOST OF THE WORLD'S
ACTIVE ON-LAND VOLCANOES

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
ARE LOCATED NEAR
CONVERGENT PLATE BOUNDARIES

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
WHERE SUBDUCTION
IS OCCURRING.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
A LOT OF DIFFERENT
FLAVORS OF VOLCANOES.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
THE TWO PROBABLY MOST
PROMINENT TYPES OF VOLCANO

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
ARE STRATA VOLCANOES
WHICH DO DEVELOP

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
ALONG CONVERGENT
PLATE MARGINS -

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
EITHER OCEANIC-OCEANIC
CONVERGENT PLATE MARGINS

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
OR OCEANIC-CONTINENTAL
CONVERGENT PLATE MARGINS.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
THESE ARE THE MOST VIOLENT
AND MOST EXPLOSIVE TYPE

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
OF VOLCANOES ON THE
PLANET AND THEY FORM

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
THE CLASSICAL CONE
SHAPE THAT YOU SEE.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
MOUNT ST. HELENS
WAS AN EXAMPLE

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
OF A VERY EXPLOSIVE
STRATA VOLCANO.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
AN IMPORTANT CLUE TO
UNDERSTANDING VOLCANOES

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
IS KNOWING THE LOCATION
OF THE VOLCANIC BANDS.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
MANY OF THE WORLD'S ACTIVE
VOLCANOES ARE LOCATED

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
AROUND THE EDGES OF
THE PACIFIC OCEAN,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
THE SO-CALLED
"RING OF FIRE".

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
SO, WE TALK ABOUT THE
PACIFIC RING OF FIRE.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
SO, THE VOLCANOES THAT GO
UP ALONG THE CASCADES IN

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST OF
THE UNITED STATES AND OUT

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
AROUND THE ALEUTIANS AND ALL
THE WAY DOWN THROUGH ASIA.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
ALL OF THESE ARE
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
VERY WATER-RICH MELTS AT
CONVERGENT PLATE BOUNDARIES

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
AND THEY
PRODUCE ABSOLUTELY

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
DEVASTATING
VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
THE SECOND MAJOR TYPE
OF VOLCANO IS CALLED

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
A "SHIELD" VOLCANO BECAUSE
IT HAS A BROAD SHIELD SHAPE

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
AND IT'S MADE OF MANY FLUID
FLOWS OF BASALTIC LAVA.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
THEY'RE INTERESTING
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
ASSOCIATED WITH
PLATE BOUNDARIES.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
THEY ARE THOUGHT TO
FORM ABOVE AREAS CALLED

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
"HOT SPOTS" THAT ARE
NOT VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
BUT SEEM TO BE SOME
THERMAL ANOMALY THAT'S

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
PROPAGATING FROM WAY DOWN
NEAR THE CORE OF THE EARTH

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
AND RISING UP THROUGH THE
MANTLE AND CAUSING HEATING

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
AND UPWELLING THAT
ALSO PRODUCES MELT.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
AND IN THIS SETTING, THE
MELTS THAT YOU GET HAVE

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
A LOW VISCOSITY, THEY TEND
TO HAVE A LOW SILICA CONTENT

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
AND THE AMOUNT OF
SILICON IN A MELT CONTROLS

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
HOW STICKY THAT MELT IS
WHICH AFFECTS HOW IT ERUPTS.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
AND THEY HAVE NOT
MUCH WATER IN THEM.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
IF YOU GO TO HAWAII AND
YOU WATCH THE VOLCANOES

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
ERUPTING THERE IT'S QUITE
SPECTACULAR TO LOOK AT

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
BUT THEY GENERALLY DON'T
CAUSE DEVASTATING DAMAGE.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
IT IS IMPORTANT
TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
GEOLOGICAL PROCESSES
OF PLATE TECTONICS

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
BECAUSE THEY HELP
EXPLAIN OUR EARTH,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
FROM THE GRAND MOUNTAINS
TO THE FIERY VOLCANOES.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
THERE ARE SO MANY ASPECTS
OF GEOLOGY AS A SCIENCE

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
THAT ARE IMPORTANT
ON HUMAN TIME SCALES.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
EVERY TIME THERE'S A LARGE
EARTHQUAKE IT AFFECTS

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE
EARTHQUAKES ARE LIKELY

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
TO OCCUR AND WHEN
THEY'RE LIKELY TO OCCUR.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
AND IF YOU LOOK AROUND
THE WORLD TODAY,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
THERE ARE MANY
VERY LARGE CITIES

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
THAT ARE SITTING RIGHT
ON PLATE BOUNDARIES.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, SAN
FRANCISCO, LOS ANGELES,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
TOKYO, ANKARA - ALL SORTS
OF PLACES AROUND THE WORLD

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
WHERE THERE IS THE
POTENTIAL FOR ABSOLUTELY

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKES
AND WE KNOW THAT

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
EARTHQUAKES HAVE OCCURRED
IN THE PAST IN ALL OF

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
THESE LOCATIONS AND BY
UNDERSTANDING HOW THE

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
PLATES ARE ACTUALLY MOVING
AND INTERACTING WITH

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
EACH OTHER, THE HOPE IS
THAT ULTIMATELY WE'LL HAVE

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
A BETTER WAY OF
FORECASTING EARTHQUAKES.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
RIGHT NOW WE CAN SAY WHERE
EARTHQUAKES ARE LIKELY

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
TO OCCUR, BUT WE'RE NOT
VERY GOOD AT SAYING

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
NEXT TUESDAY THERE'S GOING
TO BE A MAGNITUDE EIGHT.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
BECAUSE EARTH'S
INTERNAL HEAT ENGINE

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
IS ALIVE AND WELL
AND CHURNING AWAY,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
THE THING THAT REALLY
DRIVES PLATE TECTONICS,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
THE CONTINENTS
AREN'T DONE.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
THEY'RE GOING TO
CONTINUE TO MOVE ABOUT

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
AND THE FACE OF OUR GLOBE
WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
MOUNTAINS WILL BE
MADE AND ERODED AWAY.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
OCEAN BASINS WILL
OPEN AND CLOSE.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
THIS PROCESS IS GOING TO
REPEAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
AND AS WE STRIVE TO LEARN
MORE ABOUT THE PLATES

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
AND THE MYSTERIES OF
HOW OUR EARTH WORKS,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
OUR OBSERVATIONS LEAD US
TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:57.000
