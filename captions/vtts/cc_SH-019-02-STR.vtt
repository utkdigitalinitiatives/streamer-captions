00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.500


2
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.930
What from the cape can youdiscern at sea?

3
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.900
Nothing at all: it is ahighwrought flood;

4
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.900
I cannot, 'twixt theheaven and the main,

5
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.200
Descry a sail.

6
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.730
Methinks the wind hathspoke aloud at land;

7
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.570
A fuller blast ne'er shookour battlements:

8
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.030
If that the Turkish fleet

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.870
Be not enshelter'd andembay'd, they are drown'd:

10
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.570
It is impossible they bearit out.

11
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.970
News, lads!

12
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.530
Our wars are done.

13
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.770
The desperate tempest hathso bang'd the Turks,

14
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.700
That their designmenthalts: a noble ship ofVenice

15
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.500
Hath seen a grievous wreckand sufferance

16
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.670
On most part of theirfleet.

17
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.870
How! Is this true?

18
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.070
The ship is here put in,

19
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.800
A Veronesa; MichaelCassio,

20
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.230
Lieutenant to the warlikeMoor Othello,

21
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.130
Is come ashore: the Moorhimself at sea,

22
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.700
And is in full commissionhere for Cyprus.

23
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.030
I am glad on't; 'tis aworthy governor.

24
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.800
But this same Cassio,though he speak of comfort

25
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.100
Touching the Turkish loss,yet he looks sadly,

26
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.300
And prays the Moor besafe; for they were parted

27
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.430
With foul and violenttempest.

28
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.800
Pray heavens he be;

29
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.400
For I have served him, andthe man commands like afull soldier.

30
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.870
Let's to the seaside, ho!

31
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.400
As well to see the vesselthat's come in

32
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.170
As to throw out our eyesfor brave Othello,

33
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.470
Even till we make the mainand the aerial blue anindistinct regard.

34
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.700
Come, let's do so:

35
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.500
For every minute isexpectancy of morearrivance.

36
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.000
Thanks, you the valiant ofthis warlike isle,

37
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.130
That so approve the Moor!

38
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.230
O, let the heavens

39
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.830
Give him defence againstthe elements,

40
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.330
For I have lost him on adangerous sea.

41
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.670
Is he well shipp'd?

42
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.100
His bark is stoutlytimber'd, and his pilot

43
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.500
Of very expert andapproved allowance;

44
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.930
Therefore my hopes, notsurfeited to death,

45
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.370
Stand in bold cure.

46
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.400
The town is empty; on thebrow o' the sea

47
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.800
Stand ranks of people, andthey cry 'A sail!'

48
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.170
My hopes do shape him forthe governor.

49
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.430
They do discharge theirshot of courtesy:

50
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.570
Our friends at least.

51
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.730
I pray you, sir, go forth,

52
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.070
And give us truth who 'tisthat is arrived.

53
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.300
I shall.

54
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.200
But, good lieutenant, isyour general wived?

55
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.370
Most fortunately: he hathachieved a maid

56
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.800
That paragons descriptionand wild fame;

57
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.970
One that excels the quirksof blazoning pens,

58
00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.870
And in the essentialvesture of creation

59
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.900
Does tire the ingener.

60
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.100
Now! Who has put in?

61
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.330
One Iago, ancient to thegeneral.

62
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.070
Has had most favourableand happy speed:

63
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.100
Tempests themselves, highseas, and howling winds,

64
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.230
The gutter'd rocks andcongregated sands--

65
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.600
Traitors ensteep'd to clogthe guiltless keel--

66
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.200
As having sense of beauty,do omit

67
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.400
Their mortal natures,letting go safely by

68
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.230
The divine Desdemona.

69
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.070
What is she?

70
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.200
She that I spake of, ourgreat captain's captain,

71
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.600
Left in the conduct of thebold Iago,

72
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.570
Whose footing hereanticipates our thoughts

73
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.030
A se'nnight's speed.

74
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.430
Great Jove, Othello guard,

75
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.170
And swell his sail withthine own powerful breath,

76
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.700
That he may bless this baywith his tall ship,

77
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.830
Make love's quick pants inDesdemona's arms,

78
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.470
Give renew'd fire to ourextincted spirits

79
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.900
And bring all Cypruscomfort!

80
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.700
O, behold,

81
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.800
The riches of the ship iscome ashore!

82
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.900
Hail to thee, lady!

83
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.100
And the grace of heaven,

84
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.370
Before, behind thee, andon every hand,

85
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.470
Enwheel thee round!

86
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.700
I thank you, valiantCassio.

87
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.870
What tidings can you tellme of my lord?

88
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.100
He is not yet arrived: norknow I aught

89
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.400
But that he's well andwill be shortly here.

90
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.500
O, but I fear--

91
00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.770
How lost you company?

92
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.330
The great contention ofthe sea and skies

93
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.030
Parted our fellowship--

94
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.330
So speaks this voice.

95
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.430
See for the news.

96
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.030
Good ancient, you arewelcome.

97
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.730
Welcome, mistress.

98
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.570
Let it not gall yourpatience, good Iago,

99
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.530
That I extend my manners;'tis my breeding

100
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.900
That gives me this boldshow of courtesy.

101
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.670
Sir, would she give you somuch of her lips

102
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.600
As of her tongue she oftbestows on me,

103
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.700
You'll have enough.

104
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.770
Alas, she has no speech.

105
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.030
I know too much.

106
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.400
I find it ay, when I havelist to sleep:

107
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.130
Marry, before yourladyship, I grant,

108
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.030
She puts her tongue alittle in her heart,

109
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.200
And chides with thinking.

110
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.170
You have little cause tosay so.

111
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.370
Come on, come on; you arepictures out of doors,

112
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.700
Bells in your parlors,wild-cats in yourkitchens,

113
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.030
Saints in your injuries,devils being offended,

114
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.800
Players in yourhousewifery, andhousewives' in your beds.

115
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.600
O, fie upon thee,slanderer!

116
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.930
Nay, it is true, or else Iam a Turk:

117
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.900
You rise to play and go tobed to work.

118
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.500
You shall not write mypraise.

119
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.570
No, let me not.

120
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.600
What wouldst thou write ofme, if thou shouldstpraise me?

121
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.700
O gentle lady, do not putme to't;

122
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.630
For I am nothing, if notcritical.

123
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.630
Come on assay.

124
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.900
There's one gone to theharbour?

125
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.270
Ay, madam.

126
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.830
I am not merry; but dobeguile

127
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.300
The thing I am, by seemingotherwise.

128
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.600
Come, how wouldst thoupraise me?

129
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.900
I am about it; but indeedmy invention

130
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.400
Comes from my pate asbirdlime does from frize;

131
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.100
It plucks out brain andall: but my Muse labours,

132
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.900
And thus it is deliver'd.

133
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.130
If she be fair and wise,fairness and wit,

134
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.570
The one's for use, theother useth it.

135
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.370
Well praised!

136
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.470
How if black and witty?

137
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.830
If she be black, andthereto have a wit,

138
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.670
She'll find a white thatshall her blackness fit.

139
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.570
Worse and worse.

140
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.930
How if fair and foolish?

141
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.830
She never yet was foolishthat was fair;

142
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.130
For even her folly help'dher to an heir.

143
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.870
These are old fondparadoxes

144
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.070
to make fools laugh i' thealehouse.

145
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.800
Do not learn of him, Emilia,though he be thy husband.

146
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.430
How say you, Cassio?

147
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.230
Is he not a most profaneand liberal counsellor?

148
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.830
He speaks home, madam:

149
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.900
You may relish him more inthe soldier than in thescholar.

150
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.330
He takes her by the palm:ay, well said, whisper:

151
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.600
with as little a web asthis will I ensnare asgreat a fly

152
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.400
as Cassio.

153
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.530
Ay, smile upon her, do;

154
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.470
I will gyve thee in thineown courtship.

155
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.330
You say true; 'tis so,indeed:

156
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.130
if such tricks as thesewill strip you

157
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.130
of your lieutenantry, ithad been better you hadnot

158
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.370
kissed your three fingersso oft,

159
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.400
which now again you aremost apt to play the sirin.

160
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.470
Very good; well kissed!

161
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.930
An excellent courtesy!

162
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.270
'Tis so, indeed.

163
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.700
Yet again your fingers areto your lips?

164
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.530
Would they wereclyster-pipes for your sake!

165
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.200
The Moor!

166
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.300
I know his trumpet.

167
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.400
'Tis truly so.

168
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.670
Let's meet him and receivehim.

169
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.130
Lo, where he comes!

170
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.200
O my fair warrior!

171
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.370
My dear Othello!

172
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.100
It gives me wonder greatas my content

173
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.000
To see you here before me.

174
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.530
O my soul's joy!

175
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.330
If after every tempestcome such calms,

176
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.070
May the winds blow tillthey have waken'd death!

177
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.270
And let the labouring barkclimb hills of seas

178
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.300
Olympus-high and duckagain as low

179
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.470
As hell's from heaven!

180
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.300
If it were now to die,

181
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.700
'Twere now to be mosthappy; for, I fear,

182
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.370
My soul hath her contentso absolute

183
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.030
That not another comfortlike to this

184
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.300
Succeeds in unknown fate.

185
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.600
The heavens forbid

186
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.930
But that our loves andcomforts should increase,

187
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.530
Even as our days do grow!

188
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.970
Amen to that, sweetpowers!

189
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.300
I cannot speak enough ofthis content;

190
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:30.100
It stops me here; it istoo much of joy:

191
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.100
And this,

192
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:33.600
and this,

193
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.530
the greatest discords be

194
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.770
That e'er our hearts shallmake!

195
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.930
O, you are well tuned now!

196
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.230
I'll set down the pegsthat make this music,

197
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.100
As honest as I am.

198
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.230
News, friends; our warsare done,

199
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.270
the Turks are drown'd.

200
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.970
How do my old acquaintanceof the isle?

201
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.730
Honey, you shall be welldesired in Cyprus;

202
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.830
I have found great loveamongst them.

203
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:20.230
O my sweet, I prattle outof fashion, and I dote

204
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.570
In mine own comforts.

205
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.670
I prithee, good Iago,

206
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.000
Go to the bay anddisembark my coffers:

207
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.970
Bring thou the master tothe citadel;

208
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.630
He is a good one, and hisworthiness

209
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.030
Does challenge muchrespect.

210
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.770
Come, Desdemona,

211
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:41.230
Once more, well met atCyprus.

212
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.370
Do thou meet me presentlyat the harbour.

213
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.000
Come hither.

214
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.970
as, they say,st valiant--

215
00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.300
base men being in lovethan have a nobility

216
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.700
in their natures more thanis native to them--

217
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.970
list me.

218
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.430
The lieutenant tonight watcheson the court of guard--

219
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.230
first, I must tell theethis--

220
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.230
Desdemona is directly inlove with him.

221
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.330
With him!

222
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.700
Why, 'tis not possible.

223
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.970
Lay thy finger thus, andlet thy soul beinstructed.

224
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.800
Mark me with what violenceshe first loved the Moor,

225
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.870
but for bragging and tellingher fantastical lies:

226
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.470
love him still forprating?

227
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.130
Let not thy discreet heartthink so.

228
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.300
Her eye must be fed;

229
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.430
and what delight shall shehave to look on the devil?

230
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.900
When the blood is made dullwith the act of sport,

231
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.970
there should be, again toinflame it

232
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.400
and to give satiety afresh appetite,

233
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.830
loveliness in favour,sympathy in years,

234
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:51.630
manners and beauties; allwhich the Moor isdefective in:

235
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:56.430
now, for want of theserequired conveniences,

236
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.970
her delicate tendernesswill find itself abused,

237
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.200
begin to heave the gorge,disrelish and abhor the Moor;

238
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.500
very nature will instructher in it

239
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.930
and compel her to somesecond choice.

240
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.730
Now, sir, this granted--as it is a most pregnant

241
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.770
and unforward position--who stands eminent

242
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.300
in the degree of thisfortune as Cassio does?

243
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.230
A knave very voluble; nofurther conscionable

244
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.670
than in putting on themere form

245
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.400
of civil and humaneseeming,

246
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.400
for the better compassingof his salt

247
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.070
and most hidden looseaffections?

248
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:39.470
Why, none; why, none: aslipper and subtle knave,

249
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.170
a finder out of occasion,that has an eye can stamp

250
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.770
and counterfeitadvantages,

251
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:47.230
though true advantagenever present itself;

252
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.500
a devilish knave.

253
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.830
Besides, the knave ishandsome, young,

254
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.200
and hath all thoserequisites in him

255
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.530
that folly and green mindslook after:

256
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.770
a pestilent completeknave;

257
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.370
and the woman hath foundhim already.

258
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.900
I cannot believe that in her;

259
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.330
she's full of most blessedcondition.

260
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.970
Blessed fig's-end!

261
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.600
The wine she drinks ismade of grapes:

262
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.030
if she had been blessed,

263
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.030
she would never have lovedthe Moor.

264
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.900
Blessed pudding!

265
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.100
Didst thou not see herpaddle with the palm ofhis hand?

266
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.270
Didst not mark that?

267
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.370
Yes, that I did; but thatwas but courtesy.

268
00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:32.900
Lechery, by this hand; anindex and obscure prologue

269
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.270
to the history of lust andfoul thoughts.

270
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.330
They met so near withtheir lips

271
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.830
that their breathsembraced together.

272
00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.200
Villanous thoughts,Roderigo!

273
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.500
When these mutualities somarshal the way,

274
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.630
hard at hand comes themaster and main exercise,

275
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.870
the incorporateconclusion, Pish!

276
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:04.130
But, sir, be you ruled byme: I have brought youfrom Venice.

277
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.930
Watch you to-night; forthe command,

278
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.030
I'll lay't upon you.

279
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.570
Cassio knows you not.

280
00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:12.800
I'll not be far from you:

281
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.600
find some occasion toanger Cassio,

282
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.030
either by speaking tooloud, or tainting hisdiscipline;

283
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.130
or from what other courseyou please,

284
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.130
as the time will morefavourably minister.

285
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.470
Well.

286
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.500
Sir, he is rash and verysudden in choler,

287
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.270
and haply with his truncheonmay strike at you:

288
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:33.330
provoke him, that he may;for even out of that

289
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.630
will I cause these ofCyprus to mutiny;

290
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.670
whose qualification shallcome into no true taste again

291
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:42.930
but by the displanting ofCassio.

292
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:46.400
So shall you have ashorter journey

293
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.900
to your desires by themeans I shall then have toprefer them;

294
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.300
and the impediment mostprofitably removed,

295
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.770
without the which therewere no expectation of ourprosperity.

296
00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.600
I will do this, if you canbring it to anyopportunity.

297
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.130
I warrant thee.

298
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.730
Meet me by and by at thecitadel:

299
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.570
I must fetch hisnecessaries ashore.

300
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:06.700
Farewell.

301
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.770
Adieu.

302
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.670
That Cassio loves her, Ido well believe it;

303
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:23.630
That she loves him, 'tisapt and of great credit:

304
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:27.630
The Moor, howbeit I endurehim not,

305
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.570
Is of a constant, loving,noble nature,

306
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.530
And I dare think he'llprove to Desdemona

307
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:36.800
A most dear husband.

308
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.400
Now, I do love her too;

309
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.070
Not out of absolute lust,though peradventure

310
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.370
I stand accountant for asgreat a sin,

311
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.100
But partly led to diet myrevenge,

312
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.270
For that I do suspect thelustful Moor

313
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:55.100
Hath leap'd into my seat;the thought whereof

314
00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.330
Doth, like a poisonousmineral, gnaw my inwards;

315
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.530
And nothing can or shallcontent my soul

316
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.770
Till I am even'd with him,wife for wife,

317
00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:09.400
Or failing so, yet that Iput the Moor

318
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.900
At least into a jealousyso strong

319
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.570
That judgment cannot cure.

320
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.400
Which thing to do,

321
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.470
If this poor trash ofVenice, whom I trash

322
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.000
For his quick hunting,stand the putting on,

323
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.030
I'll have our MichaelCassio on the hip,

324
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.870
Abuse him to the Moor inthe rank garb--

325
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.670
For I fear Cassio with mynight-cap too--

326
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:41.870
Make the Moor thank me,love me, reward me.

327
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:46.230
For making him egregiouslyan ass

328
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.270
And practising upon hispeace and quiet

329
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:53.130
Even unto madness.

330
00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:58.300
'Tis here, but yetconfused:

331
00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:05.000
Knavery's plain face isnever seen til used.

332
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.530
Good Michael, look you tothe guard to-night:

333
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.100
Let's teach ourselves thathonourable stop,

334
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.970
Not to outsportdiscretion.

335
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.330
Iago hath direction whatto do;

336
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:46.900
But, notwithstanding, withmy personal eye

337
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.000
Will I look to't.

338
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.670
Iago is most honest.

339
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.700
Michael, good night:to-morrow with yourearliest

340
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.930
Let me have speech with you.

341
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.830
Come, my dear love,

342
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:08.200
The purchase made, thefruits are to ensue;

343
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.670
That profit's yet to come'twixt me and you.

344
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.970
Good night.

345
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:20.970
Good night.

346
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.300
To the watch.

347
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.530
Not this hour, lieutenant;'tis not yet ten o' the clock.

348
00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.970
Our general cast us thusearly for the love of hisDesdemona;

349
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.200
who let us not thereforeblame:

350
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.230
he hath not yet madewanton the night with her;

351
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.070
and she is sport for Jove.

352
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:43.570
She's a most exquisitelady.

353
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.630
And, I'll warrant her,full of game.

354
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.370
Indeed, she's a most freshand delicate creature.

355
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.600
What an eye she has!

356
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.000
Methinks it sounds aparley of provocation.

357
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.830
An inviting eye; and yetmethinks right modest.

358
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.270
And when she speaks, is itnot an alarum to love?

359
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.530
She is indeed perfection.

360
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.930
Well, happiness to theirsheets!

361
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.270
Come, lieutenant, I have astoup of wine;

362
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.730
and here without are abrace of Cyprus gallants

363
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.630
who would fain have ameasure to the health ofthe black Othello.

364
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:08.070
Not to-night, good Iago:

365
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:10.330
I have very poor andunhappy brains fordrinking:

366
00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:11.770
I could well wish courtesywould invent

367
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.570
some other custom ofentertainment.

368
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:16.100
O, they are our friends;but one cup: I'll drinkfor you.

369
00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.870
I have drunk but one cupto-night,

370
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:20.000
and that was craftilyqualified too, and,behold,

371
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.300
what innovation it makes here:

372
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.730
I am unfortunate in theinfirmity,

373
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.800
and dare not task myweakness with any more.

374
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.030
What, man!

375
00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:30.770
'Tis a night of revels:the gallants desire it.

376
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.330
Where are they?

377
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.370
Here at the door; I prayyou, call them in.

378
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.230
I'll do't; but it dislikes me.

379
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.330
If I can fasten but onecup upon him,

380
00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.830
With that which he hathdrunk to-night already,

381
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.670
He'll be as full ofquarrel and offence

382
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.600
As my young mistress' dog.

383
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.570
Now, my sick foolRoderigo,

384
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:08.500
Whom love hath turn'dalmost the wrong side out,

385
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.670
To Desdemona hath to-nightcaroused

386
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:14.130
Potations pottle-deep; andhe's to watch:

387
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:19.400
Three lads of Cyprus,noble swelling spirits,

388
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.830
That hold their honour ina wary distance,

389
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.070
The very elements of thiswarlike isle,

390
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:27.030
Have I to-night fluster'dwith flowing cups,

391
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.300
And they watch too.

392
00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:32.570
Now, 'mongst this flock ofdrunkards,

393
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.630
Am I to put our Cassio insome action

394
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:39.330
Which may offendthe isle--

395
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.130
But here they come:

396
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.030
If consequence do butapprove my dream,

397
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.230
My boat sails freely, bothwith wind and stream.

398
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.470
'Fore God, they have givenme a rouse already.

399
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.400
Good faith, a little one;not past a pint,

400
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.570
as I am a soldier.

401
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.770
Some wine, ho!

402
00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.870
And let me the canakinclink;

403
00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.170
And let me the canakinclink

404
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:04.430
A soldier's a man; Alife's but a span;

405
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.970
Why, then, let a soldierdrink.

406
00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.530
Some wine, boys!

407
00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.100
'Fore God, an excellentsong.

408
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.270
I learned it in England,where, indeed,

409
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:13.000
they are most potent inpotting:

410
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.030
your Dane, your German,your swag-belliedHollander--

411
00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.070
Drink-- are nothing toyour English.

412
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.970
Is your Englishman soexpert in his drinking?

413
00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.470
He'll drink you, withfacility, your Danedead drunk;

414
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.800
he sweats not to overthrowyour Almain;

415
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.930
he'll give your Hollandera vomit,

416
00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.030
ere the next pottle can befilled.

417
00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.430
To the health of ourgeneral!

418
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.200
I am for it, lieutenant;and I'll do you justice.

419
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.200
O sweet England!

420
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.730
King Stephen was a worthypeer,

421
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.230
His breeches cost him buta crown;

422
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:46.070
He held them sixpence alltoo dear,

423
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.100
With that he call'd thetailor lown.

424
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.500
He was a wight of highrenown,

425
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.330
And thou art but of lowdegree:

426
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.400
'Tis pride that pulls thecountry down;

427
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.900
Then take thine auld cloakabout thee.

428
00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:58.900
Some wine!

429
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.000
A more exquisite song thanthe other.

430
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.230
Will you hear't again?

431
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:05.100
No; for I hold him to beunworthy of his place

432
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.670
that does those things.

433
00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:07.970
Well, God's above all;

434
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.200
and there be souls must besaved,

435
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.470
and there be souls mustnot be saved.

436
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:12.930
It's true, goodlieutenant.

437
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.570
For mine own part-- nooffence to the general,

438
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:19.630
nor any man of quality-- Iam to be saved.

439
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.570
And so do I too,lieutenant.

440
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.100
Ay, but, by your leave,not before me;

441
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.570
the lieutenant is to besaved before the ancient.

442
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.100
Let's have no more ofthis; let's to ouraffairs--

443
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.330
God, forgive us oursins!--

444
00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.130
Gentlemen, let's look toour business.

445
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.970
Do not think, gentlemen,that I am drunk:

446
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.400
this is my ancient; thisis my right hand,

447
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.200
and this is my left: I amnot drunk now;

448
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.100
I can stand well enough,and I can speak wellenough.

449
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.070
All Excellent well.

450
00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.000
Very well then;

451
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.870
you must not think that Iam drunk.

452
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.830
You see this fellow who isgone before;

453
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.230
He is a soldier fit tostand by Caesar

454
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:13.930
And give direction: and dobut see his vice;

455
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:15.830
'Tis to his virtue a justequinox,

456
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.800
The one as long as theother: 'tis pity of him.

457
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.600
I fear the trust Othelloputs him in.

458
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.500
On some odd time of hisinfirmity,

459
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.770
Will shake this island.

460
00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.900
But is he often thus?

461
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.730
'Tis evermore the prologueto his sleep:

462
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.630
He'll watch the horologe adouble set,

463
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.670
If drink rock not hiscradle.

464
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.630
It were well

465
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.530
The general were put inmind of it.

466
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.730
Perhaps he sees it not; orhis good nature

467
00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:42.600
Prizes the virtue thatappears in Cassio,

468
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.870
And looks not on hisevils: is not this true?

469
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.870
How now, Roderigo!

470
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.070
After the lieutenant; go.

471
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.330
And 'tis great pity thatthe noble Moor

472
00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:55.130
Should hazard such a placeas his own second

473
00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:57.870
With one of an ingraftinfirmity:

474
00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:02.430
It were an honest actionto say so to the Moor.

475
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:03.900
Not I, for all thisisland:

476
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.730
I do love Cassio well; andwould do much

477
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:08.570
To cure him of this evil--

478
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:09.700
What noise?

479
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.930
What's the matter,lieutenant?

480
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.130
A knave teach me my duty!

481
00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.770
I'll beat the knave into atwiggen bottle.

482
00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:15.030
Beat me!

483
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.270
Dost thou prate, rogue?

484
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.600
Nay, good lieutenant; Iprithee, hold thy hand.

485
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.400
Away, I say; go out, andcry a mutiny.

486
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.870
Come, you're drunk.

487
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:29.530
God's will, gentlemen,help.

488
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:33.100
Ho!--Lieutenant--sir--Montano--sir;

489
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.330
Help, masters!-- Here's agoodly--

490
00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:43.500
Lieutenant, sir, God'swill, You'll be shamedforever.

491
00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.370
Ho! For your lives.

492
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.370
From whence ariseth this?

493
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:08.100
Are we turn'd Turks, andto ourselves do that

494
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.730
Which heaven hath forbidthe Ottomites?

495
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:13.900
For Christian shame, putby this barbarous brawl:

496
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.600
He that stirs next tocarve for his own rage

497
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.570
Holds his soul light; hedies upon his motion.

498
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:25.070
Silence that dreadfulbell: it frights the isle

499
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.330
From her propriety.

500
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.030
What is the matter,masters?

501
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.370
Honest Iago, that look'stdead with grieving,

502
00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:40.670
Speak, who began this?

503
00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:41.930
On thy love, I chargethee.

504
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:45.770
I do not know: friends allbut now, even now,

505
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:49.170
In quarter, and in termslike bride and groom

506
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:51.970
Devesting them for bed;and then, but now--

507
00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.900
As if some planet hadunwitted men--

508
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.430
Swords out, and tiltingone at other's breast,

509
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:59.800
In opposition bloody.

510
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.100
I cannot speak

511
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.530
Any beginning to thispeevish odds;

512
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:05.000
And would in actionglorious I had lost

513
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.300
These legs that brought meto a part of it!

514
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.370
How comes it, Michael, youare thus forgot?

515
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.430
I pray you, pardon me; Icannot speak.

516
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.930
Worthy Montano, you werewont to be civil;

517
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.730
The gravity and stillnessof your youth

518
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.130
The world hath noted, andyour name is great

519
00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:34.000
In mouths of wisestcensure: what's thematter,

520
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.770
That you unlace yourreputation thus

521
00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.130
And spend your richopinion for the name

522
00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:40.430
Of a night-brawler?

523
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:41.430
Give me answer to it.

524
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.230
Worthy Othello, I am hurtto danger:

525
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.730
Your officer, Iago, caninform you--

526
00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:53.370
While I spare breath,which something nowoffends me--

527
00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.000
Of all that I do know: norknow I aught

528
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.730
By me that's said or doneamiss this night;

529
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.970
Unless self-charity besometimes a vice,

530
00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.770
And to defend ourselves itbe a sin

531
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.670
When violence assails us.

532
00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:08.000
Now, by heaven,

533
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.170
My blood begins my saferguides to rule;

534
00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.770
And passion, having mybest judgment collied,

535
00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:15.500
Assays to lead the way:

536
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.670
Zounds, if I stir,

537
00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.600
Or but lift this arm, thebest of you

538
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.830
Shall sink in my rebuke.

539
00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:25.200
Give me to know

540
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.900
How this foul rout began,who set it on;

541
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.530
And he that is approved inthis offence,

542
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.500
Though he had twinn'd withme, both at a birth,

543
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:32.600
Shall lose me.

544
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.800
What, In a town of war,

545
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.800
Yet wild, the people'shearts brimful of fear,

546
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.630
To manage private anddomestic quarrel,

547
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:42.270
At night, and on the courtand guard of safety!

548
00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:46.530
'Tis monstrous.

549
00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:49.670
Iago, who began't?

550
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.770
Partially affined, orleagued in office,

551
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.530
Thou dost deliver more orless than truth,

552
00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:55.030
Thou art no soldier.

553
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:57.600
Touch me not so near:

554
00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.700
I had rather have thistongue cut from my mouth

555
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.300
Than it should do offenceto Michael Cassio;

556
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.370
Yet, I persuade myself, tospeak the truth

557
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:05.800
Shall nothing wrong him.

558
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.370
Thus it is, general.

559
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.770
Montano and myself beingin speech,

560
00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.570
There comes a fellowcrying out for help:

561
00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.830
And Cassio following himwith determined sword,

562
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.570
To execute upon him.

563
00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:20.870
Sir, this gentleman

564
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.670
Steps in to Cassio, toentreat his pause:

565
00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:25.400
Myself the crying fellowdid pursue,

566
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.270
Lest by his clamour-- asit so fell out--

567
00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.670
The town might fall infright: he, swift of foot,

568
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.670
Outran my purpose; and Ireturn'd the rather

569
00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.030
For that I heard the clinkand fall of swords,

570
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.430
And Cassio high in oath;which till to-night

571
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:38.930
I ne'er might say before.

572
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:41.830
When I came back-- Forthis was brief--

573
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.000
I found them closetogether,

574
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.770
At blow and thrust; evenas again they were

575
00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.300
When you yourself did partthem.

576
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.800
More of this matter can Inot report:

577
00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:55.230
But men are men; the bestsometimes forget:

578
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:57.830
Though Cassio did somelittle wrong to him,

579
00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:02.500
As men in rage strikethose that wish them best,

580
00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.100
Yet surely Cassio, Ibelieve, received

581
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.570
From him that fled somestrange indignity

582
00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.570
That patience could notpass.

583
00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.930
I know, Iago,

584
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.600
Thy honesty and love dothmince this matter,

585
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.130
Making it light to Cassio.

586
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:23.400
Cassio, I love thee

587
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.900
But never more be officerof mine.

588
00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.300
Look, if my gentle love benot raised up!

589
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.570
I'll make thee an example.

590
00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:38.170
What is the matter, dear?

591
00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.900
All's well now, sweeting;come away to bed.

592
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.430
Sir, for your hurts,myself will be yoursurgeon:

593
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:42.470
Lead him off.

594
00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:53.130
Iago, look with care aboutthe town,

595
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:57.730
And silence those whomthis vile brawldistracted.

596
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:02.800
Come, Desdemona: 'tis thesoldiers' life

597
00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.630
To have their balmyslumbers waked withstrife.

598
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:38.030
What, are you hurt,lieutenant?

599
00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.630
Ay, past all surgery.

600
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:43.670
Marry, God forbid!

601
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.330
Reputation, reputation,

602
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:52.570
I've lost my reputation!

603
00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.730
I have lost the immortalpart of me,

604
00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:55.730
and what remains isbestial.

605
00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:00.070
My reputation, Iago, myreputation!

606
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.370
As I am an honest man, Ithought you had received

607
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.030
some bodily wound;

608
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.670
there is more sense inthat than in reputation.

609
00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:14.330
Reputation's an idle andmost false imposition:

610
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:18.070
oft gained without merit,and lost withoutdeserving:

611
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.900
you have lost noreputation at all,

612
00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.400
unless you repute yourselfsuch a loser.

613
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.900
What, man!

614
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.070
There are ways to recoverthe general again:

615
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:29.870
you are but now cast inhis mood,

616
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:32.230
a punishment more inpolicy than in malice,

617
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.770
as one would beat one'soffenceless dog

618
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.000
to affright an imperiouslion:

619
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.500
sue to him again, and he'syours.

620
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.930
I will rather sue to bedespised

621
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.870
than to deceive so good acommander with so slight,

622
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:44.070
so drunken, and soindiscreet an officer.

623
00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.200
Drunk?

624
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.030
And speak parrot? Andsquabble?

625
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:49.830
Swagger? Swear?

626
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:53.470
And discourse fustian withone's own shadow?

627
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.330
O thou invisible spirit ofwine,

628
00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:56.600
if thou hast no name to beknown by,

629
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.470
let us call thee devil!

630
00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:00.170
What was he that youfollowed with your sword?

631
00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:01.270
What had he done to you?

632
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:02.370
I know not.

633
00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:03.800
Is't possible?

634
00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.930
I remember a mass ofthings, but nothingdistinctly;

635
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:08.170
a quarrel, but nothingwherefore.

636
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:09.730
O God, that men should putan enemy in their mouths

637
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:12.970
to steal away theirbrains!

638
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.670
That we should, with joy,pleasance revel andapplause,

639
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.470
transform ourselves intobeasts!

640
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.630
Why, you are but now wellenough:

641
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:22.730
how came you thusrecovered?

642
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:23.900
It hath pleased the devildrunkenness

643
00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.170
to give place to the devilwrath;

644
00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:26.470
one unperfectness shows meanother,

645
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:27.930
to make me frankly despisemyself.

646
00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.230
Come, you are too severe amoraler:

647
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:32.330
as the time, the place,and the condition

648
00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.530
of this country stands, Icould heartily wish

649
00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:38.200
this had not befallen;but, since it is as it is,

650
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.600
mend it for your own good.

651
00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.470
I will ask him for myplace again;

652
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:47.870
he shall tell me I am adrunkard.

653
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:49.070
Had I as many mouths asHydra,

654
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:51.030
such an answer would stopthem all.

655
00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.730
To be now a sensible man,by and by a fool,

656
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:55.130
and presently a beast!

657
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.230
O strange!

658
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:58.570
Every inordinate cup isunblessed

659
00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:00.570
and the ingredient is adevil.

660
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:04.100
Come, come, good wine is agood familiar creature,

661
00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:07.870
if it be well used: exclaimno more against it.

662
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:13.570
And, good lieutenant, Ithink you think I love you.

663
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:15.970
I have well approved it,sir.

664
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:17.930
I drunk!

665
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:20.400
You or any man living maybe drunk

666
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.630
at some time, man.

667
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:32.900
I shall tell you what youshall do.

668
00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.800
Our general's wife is nowthe general:

669
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.630
I may say so in thisrespect,

670
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.800
that he hath devoted andgiven up himself

671
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.200
to the contemplation,mark, and denotement

672
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:47.070
of her parts and graces:confess yourself freelyto her;

673
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:50.330
importune her help to putyou in your place again:

674
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:55.430
she is of so free, sokind, so apt,

675
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:57.170
so blessed a disposition,

676
00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:59.800
she holds it a vice in hergoodness

677
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.870
not to do more than she isrequested:

678
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:06.830
this broken joint betweenyou and her husband

679
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.770
entreat her to splinter;

680
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:12.130
and, my fortune againstany lay worth naming,

681
00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:14.700
this crack of your loveshallgrow stronger than itwas before.

682
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.200
You advise me well.

683
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.370
I protest, in thesincerity of love andhonest kindness.

684
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:21.070
I think it freely; andbetimes in the morning

685
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:22.630
I will beseech thevirtuous Desdemona

686
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:23.970
to undertake for me:

687
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:27.600
I am desperate of my fortunesif they cheque me here.

688
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.730
You are in the right,lieutenant.

689
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.200
Good night; I must to thewatch.

690
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.930
Good night, honest Iago.

691
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.230
And what's he then thatsays I play the villain?

692
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.600
When this advice is free Igive, honest,

693
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.470
Probal to thinking andindeed the course

694
00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:56.900
To win the Moor again?

695
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.100
For 'tis most easy

696
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.930
The inclining Desdemona tosubdue

697
00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:04.130
In any honest suit: she'sframed as fruitful

698
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.230
As the free elements.

699
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:06.730
And then for her

700
00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:13.370
To win the Moor-- were'tto renounce his baptism,

701
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:17.430
All seals and symbols ofredeemed sin,

702
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:20.230
His soul is so enfetter'dto her love,

703
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:24.770
That she may make, unmake,do what she list,

704
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.130
Even as her appetite shallplay the god

705
00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.870
With his weak function.

706
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.270
How am I then a villain

707
00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.730
To counsel Cassio to thisparallel course,

708
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:36.070
Directly to his good?

709
00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:45.000
Divinity of hell!

710
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:50.270
When devils will theblackest sins put on,

711
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:53.670
They do suggest at firstwith heavenly shows,

712
00:33:53.670 --> 00:34:00.230
As I do now: for whilstthis honest fool

713
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:04.130
Plies Desdemona to repairhis fortunes

714
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:08.470
And she for him pleadsstrongly with the Moor,

715
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:12.270
I'll pour this pestilenceinto his ear,

716
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:16.470
That she repeals him forher body's lust;

717
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:19.530
By how much she strives todo him good,

718
00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:22.000
She'll undo her creditwith the Moor.

719
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.800
So shall I turn her virtueinto pitch,

720
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.130
And out of her owngoodness make the net

721
00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.270
That shall enmesh themall.

722
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:41.470
How now, Roderigo!

723
00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.330
I do follow here in thechase, not like a houndthat hunts,

724
00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:50.670
but one that fills upthe cry.

725
00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.570
My money is almost spent;

726
00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:55.830
I have been to-nightexceedingly wellcudgelled;

727
00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:57.300
and I think the issuewill be,

728
00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.330
I shall have so muchexperience for my pains asthat comes to,

729
00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:03.970
and so, with no money atall and a little more wit,

730
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.170
return again to Venice.

731
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:10.330
How poor are they thathave not patience!

732
00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:14.530
What wound did ever healbut by degrees?

733
00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:19.930
Thou know'st we work bywit, and not bywitchcraft;

734
00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:22.870
And wit depends ondilatory time.

735
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:24.730
Does't not go well?

736
00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:27.030
Cassio hath beaten thee.

737
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:30.630
And thou, by that smallhurt, hast cashier'dCassio:

738
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:34.130
Though other things growfair against the sun,

739
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:39.770
Yet fruits that blossomfirst shall first be ripe:

740
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:41.270
Content thyself awhile.

741
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:49.500
By the mass, 'tis morning;

742
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:56.930
Pleasure and action makethe hours seem short.

743
00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:59.070
Retire thee;

744
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.700
go where thou artbilleted:

745
00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:05.070
Away, I say;

746
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:11.600
thou shalt know morehereafter: Nay, get thee gone.

747
00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:20.330
Two things are to be done:

748
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:26.330
My wife must move forCassio to her mistress;

749
00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:27.330
I'll set her on;

750
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:31.670
Myself the while to drawthe Moor apart,

751
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.030
And bring him jump when hemay Cassio find

752
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.500
Soliciting his wife:

753
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:44.570
ay, that's the way

754
00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:48.200
Dull not device withcoldness and delay.

755
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:59.030
