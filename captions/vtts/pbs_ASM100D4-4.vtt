TOTAL ECONOMIC OUTPUT

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.999

{justify:center}THE TOTAL VALUE OF

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.999
{justify:center}WAS ROUGHLY $119 TRILLION,

{justify:center}HAD TURNED INTO PLANET FINANCE.

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:52.999

{justify:center}OF HOW THOSE 
FINANCIAL INNOVATIONS

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:18.999
{justify:center}CONQUERED THE WORLD.

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:25.999
{justify:center}THIS IS THE STORY OF 
FINANCIAL GLOBALIZATION.

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:29.417
{justify:center}GLOBALIZATION IS SOMETHING 
WE TAKE FOR GRANTED TODAY,

00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:32.999

{justify:center}ITS VULNERABILITY 
TO FINANCIAL SHOCKS

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.999
{justify:center}BECAUSE FINANCE ISNT 
AN EXACT SCIENCE

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:49.959

IS THAT THIS CRISIS

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.999
{justify:center}HAD ITS ORIGINS IN THE 
AMERICAN PROPERTY MARKET

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:27.999

RIVER ROUGE PLANT WAS

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:20.999
{justify:center}THE VERY OPPOSITE, 
A CAPITALIST SOCIETY

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:24.125

{justify:center}THE CITYS DIGNITARIES 
WERE APPALLED.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.999
{justify:center}THEY SAW THEM AS

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:50.999
{justify:center}A TRAVESTY ON THE 
SPIRIT OF DETROIT.

{justify:center}THE POWER OF ART IS 
A WONDERFUL THING,

TO TAKE SOMETHING RATHER 
MORE POWERFUL THAN ART

00:07:55.999 --> 00:08:01.542

THE ANSWER WAS THE NEW DEAL,

00:08:07.999 --> 00:08:10.999
{justify:center}AND THAT INCLUDED A 
NEW DEAL ON HOUSING.

00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:13.834

00:08:29.999 --> 00:08:33.959

WOULD RIG THE HOUSING MARKET

00:09:47.417 --> 00:09:49.999
{justify:center}FOR ACCORDING TO THIS SIGN, 
THEY CAN BUY THIS HOUSE

00:09:49.999 --> 00:09:51.999
{justify:center}WITH MONTHLY PAYMENTS 
THAT ARE LESS THAN

00:09:51.999 --> 00:09:59.999
{justify:center}THEY NOW SPEND FOR RENT.

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:01.999
{justify:center}Ferguson: ITS NOT 
TOO MUCH TO SAY

00:10:01.999 --> 00:10:03.999
{justify:center}THAT THE MODERN UNITED STATES,

00:10:03.999 --> 00:10:06.999
{justify:center}WITH ITS SEDUCTIVELY 
SAMEY SUBURBS,

00:10:06.999 --> 00:10:11.999
{justify:center}WAS BORN OUT OF THESE 
NEW DEAL REFORMS.

00:10:11.999 --> 00:10:14.417
{justify:center}FROM THE 1930s THEN, 
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

00:10:14.417 --> 00:10:16.999
{justify:center}EFFECTIVELY UNDERWROTE 
THE MORTGAGE MARKET,

00:10:16.999 --> 00:10:18.999
{justify:center}BRINGING BORROWERS 
AND LENDERS TOGETHER,

00:10:18.999 --> 00:10:22.999
{justify:center}AND THAT WAS THE REASON 
FOR THE BIG EXPLOSION 
IN PROPERTY OWNERSHIP

00:10:22.999 --> 00:10:26.999
{justify:center}AND MORTGAGE DEBT IN THE 
DECADES AFTER WORLD WAR II.

00:10:26.999 --> 00:10:28.999
{justify:center}THERE WAS JUST ONE CATCH.

00:10:28.999 --> 00:10:30.999
{justify:center}NOT EVERYONE IN AMERICAN SOCIETY

00:10:30.999 --> 00:10:41.834
{justify:center}HAD AN INVITATION TO THE 
PROPERTY-OWNING PARTY.

00:10:41.834 --> 00:10:45.999
{justify:center}WHEN THESE HOUSES WERE BUILT 
IN DETROIT BACK IN 1941,

00:10:45.999 --> 00:10:48.999
{justify:center}WHETHER YOU GOT THE MONEY 
OR NOT FOR A MORTGAGE

00:10:48.999 --> 00:10:53.125
{justify:center}DEPENDED ON WHICH SIDE 
OF THIS DIVIDE YOU LIVED.

00:10:53.125 --> 00:10:56.999
{justify:center}IT WAS A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER 
WHO BUILD THIS 6-FOOT-HIGH WALL

00:10:56.999 --> 00:10:59.999
{justify:center}RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF 
DETROITS 8 MILE DISTRICT.

00:10:59.999 --> 00:11:02.999
{justify:center}HE HAD TO BUILD IT IN 
ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR LOANS

00:11:02.999 --> 00:11:05.999
{justify:center}FROM THE FEDERAL 
HOUSING ADMINISTRATION.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.667
{justify:center}THE LOANS WERE TO BE 
GIVEN FOR CONSTRUCTION

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:08.999
{justify:center}ON THAT SIDE OF THE WALL,

00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:10.999
{justify:center}WHICH WAS A PREDOMINANTLY 
WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:11:10.999 --> 00:11:12.999
{justify:center}ON THIS SIDE, ON 
THE BLACK SIDE,

00:11:12.999 --> 00:11:14.999
{justify:center}THERE WAS TO BE 
NO FEDERAL CREDIT

00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:16.999
{justify:center}BECAUSE AFRICAN-AMERICANS 
WERE REGARDED

00:11:16.999 --> 00:11:22.999
{justify:center}AS FUNDAMENTALLY UNCREDITWORTHY.

00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:29.959
{justify:center}IT WAS PART OF A SYSTEM 
THAT DIVIDED WHOLE CITIES, 
IN THEORY, BY CREDIT RATING,

00:11:29.959 --> 00:11:31.999
{justify:center}IN PRACTICE, BY COLOR.

00:11:31.999 --> 00:11:34.999
{justify:center}SEGREGATION, IN OTHER 
WORDS, WASNT ACCIDENTAL

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:40.999
{justify:center}BUT A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE 
OF FEDERAL POLICY.

00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:43.250
{justify:center}THIS MAP BY THE FEDERAL 
HOME LOAN BOARD SHOWS

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.999
{justify:center}THE PREDOMINANTLY BLACK AREAS 
OF DETROIT, THE LOWER EAST SIDE

00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:50.999
{justify:center}AND SO-CALLED COLONIES 
LIKE THE ONE WERE IN 
NOW IN BURWOOD-GRIGGS,

00:11:50.999 --> 00:11:55.999
{justify:center}MARKED WITH THE LETTER 
D AND COLORED RED.

00:11:55.999 --> 00:11:58.959
{justify:center}YOU CAN SEE WHY THE PRACTICE 
OF GIVING WHOLE NEIGHBORHOODS

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:02.542
{justify:center}A NEGATIVE CREDIT RATING CAME 
TO BE KNOWN AS RED-LINING.

00:12:02.542 --> 00:12:04.999
{justify:center}THE RESULT WAS THAT WHEN 
PEOPLE FROM AROUND HERE

00:12:04.999 --> 00:12:06.542
{justify:center}NEEDED MORTGAGES, 
THEY HAD TO PAY

00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:08.959
{justify:center}SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER 
INTEREST RATES

00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:12.999
{justify:center}THAN THE FOLKS IN THE 
WHITE PART OF TOWN.

00:12:12.999 --> 00:12:16.000
{justify:center}HALF A CENTURY LATER, THE 
TWO CATEGORIES OF BORROWERS

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.999
{justify:center}WOULD COME TO BE 
KNOWN EUPHEMISTICALLY 
AS PRIME AND SUBPRIME,

00:12:22.999 --> 00:12:24.999
{justify:center}BUT IN THE 1960s, 
THIS DIVIDE WAS

00:12:24.999 --> 00:12:29.999
{justify:center}THE HIDDEN FINANCIAL DIMENSION 
OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE.

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:31.250
{justify:center}BLACKS WERE TO BE EXCLUDED

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.999
{justify:center}FROM THE NEW 
PROPERTY-OWNING SOCIETY.

00:12:34.999 --> 00:12:40.999
{justify:center}THERE WOULD BE A HEAVY PRICE 
TO PAY FOR THIS EXCLUSION.

00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:44.999
{justify:center}ON JULY 23, 1967, 
PROPERTY IN DETROIT

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:47.999
{justify:center}LITERALLY WENT UP IN FLAMES.

00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:51.999
{justify:center}Man: 4 DAYS OF RIOTING, 
LOOTING, AND ARSON ROCKED 
THE CITY OF DETROIT

00:12:51.999 --> 00:12:56.999
{justify:center}IN THE WORST OUTBREAK OF URBAN 
RACIAL VIOLENCE THIS YEAR.

00:12:56.999 --> 00:12:58.999
{justify:center}Ferguson: ANGER AT 
ECONOMIC DISCRIMINATION

00:12:58.999 --> 00:13:02.250
{justify:center}SPILLED OVER INTO 
5 DAYS OF RIOTING

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.417
{justify:center}THAT LEFT 43 PEOPLE DEAD.

00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:07.999
{justify:center}SIGNIFICANTLY, MOST OF 
THE VIOLENCE WAS DIRECTED

00:13:07.999 --> 00:13:11.000
{justify:center}NOT AGAINST PEOPLE 
BUT AGAINST PROPERTY.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:21.999
{justify:center}NEARLY 3,000 BUILDINGS 
WERE LOOTED OR BURNED.

00:13:21.999 --> 00:13:23.999
{justify:center}THE REAL LESSON 
FOR POLICY MAKERS

00:13:23.999 --> 00:13:25.999
{justify:center}WAS THAT EXCLUDING 
ETHNIC MINORITIES

00:13:25.999 --> 00:13:27.999
{justify:center}FROM THE PROPERTY-OWNING 
DEMOCRACY

00:13:27.999 --> 00:13:30.667
{justify:center}WAS A FAST TRACK TO TROUBLE.

00:13:30.667 --> 00:13:32.999
{justify:center}TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL 
LIKE STAKEHOLDERS

00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:34.999
{justify:center}IN THE SOCIAL STATUS QUO,

00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:40.250
{justify:center}YOU HAD TO MAKE THEM 
PROPERTY OWNERS.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.999
{justify:center}INDEED, WIDENING 
HOME OWNERSHIP

00:13:41.999 --> 00:13:47.999
{justify:center}MIGHT EVEN TURN THE MALCONTENTS 
INTO CONSERVATIVES.

00:13:47.999 --> 00:13:51.999
{justify:center}THIS WAS A LESSON THAT MARGARET 
THATCHER WAS QUICK TO LEARN.

00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:55.000
{justify:center}IN BRITAIN, THE IDEA OF THE 
PROPERTY-OWNING DEMOCRACY

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.999
{justify:center}BECAME A KEYSTONE OF 
1980s CONSERVATISM.

00:14:00.999 --> 00:14:02.999
{justify:center}BY SELLING OFF COUNCIL HOUSING

00:14:02.999 --> 00:14:03.999
{justify:center}AT BARGAIN BASEMENT PRICES,

00:14:03.999 --> 00:14:07.999
{justify:center}THATCHER ENSURED THAT MORE 
AND MORE BRITISH COUPLES

00:14:07.999 --> 00:14:10.999
{justify:center}HAD A HOME OF THEIR OWN.

00:14:10.999 --> 00:14:17.999
{justify:center}THAT ALSO MEANT THAT MORE 
PEOPLE THAN EVER HAD MORTGAGES.

00:14:17.999 --> 00:14:20.417
{justify:center}UP UNTIL THE 1980s, 
GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES

00:14:20.417 --> 00:14:23.959
{justify:center}TO BORROW MONEY AND BUY A 
HOUSE MADE PRETTY GOOD SENSE

00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:25.125
{justify:center}FOR THE AVERAGE BRITISH FAMILY.

00:14:25.125 --> 00:14:26.999
{justify:center}INTEREST RATES 
WERE RELATIVELY LOW

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:28.125
{justify:center}IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES,

00:14:28.125 --> 00:14:30.999
{justify:center}AND THE INFLATION RATE 
TENDED TO CREEP UP

00:14:30.999 --> 00:14:34.999
{justify:center}SO THAT THE REAL VOLUME OF 
MORTGAGE DEBT TENDED TO FALL,

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:35.999
{justify:center}BUT THERE WAS A 
STING IN THE TAIL.

00:14:35.999 --> 00:14:39.999
{justify:center}THE VERY SAME GOVERNMENTS 
THAT PROFESSED THEIR FAITH

00:14:39.999 --> 00:14:40.999
{justify:center}IN THE PROPERTY-OWNING DEMOCRACY

00:14:40.999 --> 00:14:43.999
{justify:center}WERE ALSO COMMITTED 
TO FIGHTING INFLATION,

00:14:43.999 --> 00:14:46.834
{justify:center}AND THAT MEANT RAISING 
INTEREST RATES.

{justify:center}THE BRITISH AND AMERICAN 
POLICY OF ENCOURAGING 
PEOPLE TO TAKE OUT MORTGAGES

SPECTACULAR BOOMS AND BUSTS

{justify:center}THAT A CRASH IN THE 
AMERICAN PROPERTY MARKET

00:15:30.999 --> 00:15:34.999
{justify:center}COULD TRIGGER A MAJOR

DOUBLE-DIGIT INFLATION

{justify:center}INDEED AT ONE TIME, 
ITS PER CAPITAL INCOME

00:28:38.999 --> 00:28:42.834
{justify:center}WAS JUST 18% LESS THAN 
THAT OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:28:42.834 --> 00:28:45.417
{justify:center}INVESTORS WHO FLOCKED 
TO BUY ARGENTINE BONDS

00:28:45.417 --> 00:28:47.250
{justify:center}HOPED THAT ARGENTINA 
WOULD BECOME

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:52.999
{justify:center}THE UNITED STATES 
OF SOUTH AMERICA.

00:28:52.999 --> 00:28:57.000
{justify:center}IS A CLASSIC ILLUSTRATION 
THAT ALL THE RESOURCES 
AND TALENT IN THE WORLD

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:10.999
{justify:center}CAN BE SET AT NAUGHT BY CHRONIC 
FINANCIAL MISMANAGEMENT.

00:29:10.999 --> 00:29:14.999
{justify:center}THERE HAVE BEEN MANY FINANCIAL 
CRISES IN ARGENTINE HISTORY,

00:29:14.999 --> 00:29:34.417
{justify:center}BUT THE CRISIS THAT 
HIT THE COUNTRY IN 
1989 WAS UNPARALLELED.

00:29:34.417 --> 00:29:36.999
{justify:center}AT THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY, 
THE COUNTRY WAS SUFFERING

00:29:36.999 --> 00:29:39.999
{justify:center}ONE OF THE HOTTEST 
SUMMERS ON RECORD.

00:29:39.999 --> 00:29:44.125
{justify:center}IN BUENOS AIRES, THE 
ELECTRICITY SYSTEM 
JUST COULDNT COPE.

00:29:44.125 --> 00:29:49.999
{justify:center}5-HOUR POWER CUTS 
WERE COMMONPLACE.

00:29:49.999 --> 00:29:51.999
{justify:center}BUT THESE, AS IT TURNED OUT,

00:29:51.999 --> 00:29:55.999
{justify:center}WERE THE LEAST OF 
ARGENTINAS PROBLEMS.

00:29:55.999 --> 00:29:57.999
{justify:center}AS IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE CASE,

00:29:57.999 --> 00:30:02.999
{justify:center}THERE WERE SEVERAL WELL-TRODDEN 
STEPS TO MONETARY HELL.

00:30:02.999 --> 00:30:05.542
{justify:center}IN STEP ONE, THE 
GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE,

00:30:05.542 --> 00:30:07.999
{justify:center}MUCH MORE THAN IT CAN 
RAISE IN TAXATION.

00:30:07.999 --> 00:30:10.999
{justify:center}USUALLY BUT NOT ALWAYS 
ITS BECAUSE OF A WAR.

00:30:10.999 --> 00:30:12.999
{justify:center}IN ARGENTINAS CASE, 
THERE WERE TWO,

00:30:12.999 --> 00:30:16.999
{justify:center}ONE A CIVIL WAR 
BETWEEN GENERALS AND 
THE LEFT IN THE 1970s,

00:30:16.999 --> 00:30:19.417
{justify:center}THE OTHER A FOREIGN 
WAR AGAINST BRITAIN

00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:21.999
{justify:center}OVER THE FALKLAND 
ISLANDS IN 1982.

00:30:21.999 --> 00:30:27.999
{justify:center}BY 1989, THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 
WAS ABOUT READY TO BLOW.

00:30:27.999 --> 00:30:35.999
{justify:center}BY FEBRUARY, INFLATION HAD 
ALREADY REACHED 10% PER MONTH.

00:30:35.999 --> 00:30:38.999
{justify:center}BANKS WERE ORDERED TO CLOSE 
AS THE GOVERNMENT TRIED

00:30:38.999 --> 00:30:44.999
{justify:center}AND PREVENT THE CURRENCYS 
EXCHANGE RATE FROM COLLAPSING.

00:30:44.999 --> 00:30:45.999
{justify:center}IT DIDNT WORK.

00:30:45.999 --> 00:30:53.125
{justify:center}IN JUST A MONTH, THE AUSTRAL 
FELL 140% AGAINST THE DOLLAR.

00:30:53.125 --> 00:30:57.667
{justify:center}AT THE SAME TIME, 
THE WORLD BANK FROZE 
LENDING TO ARGENTINA,

00:30:57.667 --> 00:30:58.999
{justify:center}SAYING THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
HAD FAILED TO TACKLE

00:30:58.999 --> 00:31:04.000
{justify:center}THE ROOT CAUSE OF INFLATION, A 
BLOATED PUBLIC SECTOR DEFICIT.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.417
{justify:center}WITH NO CHEAP LOANS FORTHCOMING 
FROM THE WORLD BANK,

00:31:07.417 --> 00:31:09.999
{justify:center}THE GOVERNMENT TRIED 
TO FINANCE ITS DEFICIT

00:31:09.999 --> 00:31:11.999
{justify:center}BY SELLING BONDS 
TO THE PUBLIC,

00:31:11.999 --> 00:31:13.999
{justify:center}BUT INVESTORS WERE HARDLY 
LIKELY TO BUY BONDS

00:31:13.999 --> 00:31:15.999
{justify:center}WITH THE PROSPECT 
THAT THEIR REAL VALUE

00:31:15.999 --> 00:31:17.999
{justify:center}WOULD BE WIPED OUT BY INFLATION

00:31:17.999 --> 00:31:19.999
{justify:center}IN JUST A MATTER OF DAYS.

00:31:19.999 --> 00:31:21.417
{justify:center}NOBODY WAS BUYING.

00:31:21.417 --> 00:31:26.667
{justify:center}THE GOVERNMENT WAS 
RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS.

00:31:26.667 --> 00:31:29.999
{justify:center}IN APRIL, FURIOUS CUSTOMERS 
OVERTURNED SHOPPING TROLLEYS

ANNOUNCED OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.999

{justify:center}WITH NO FOREIGN LOANS AND NO 
ONE WILLING TO BUY BONDS,

00:32:19.999 --> 00:32:21.999
{justify:center}THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING LEFT

00:32:21.999 --> 00:32:23.999
{justify:center}FOR AN INCREASINGLY 
DESPERATE GOVERNMENT TO DO,

{justify:center}GET THE CENTRAL BANK LITERALLY 
TO PRINT MORE MONEY,

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:34.000

EVEN GET THAT RIGHT.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.999

00:38:55.999 --> 00:38:57.999
{justify:center}CONVERTED INTO FULL OWNERSHIP.

00:38:57.999 --> 00:38:59.999
{justify:center}YOU CAN TELL THEYRE 
OWNER-OCCUPIED BY THE FACT

00:38:59.999 --> 00:39:02.999
{justify:center}THAT THERES A FENCE, 
THE WALLS ARE PAINTED.

00:39:02.999 --> 00:39:04.999
{justify:center}THERES EVEN A RATHER 
EXCITABLE GUARD DOG.

00:39:04.999 --> 00:39:10.667
{justify:center}AFTER ALL, OWNERS TEND 
TO LOOK AFTER PROPERTIES 
BETTER THAN TENANTS,

00:39:10.667 --> 00:39:12.667
{justify:center}AND SOME OF THE OWNERS 
HERE ARE EVEN REALIZING

00:39:12.667 --> 00:39:18.999
{justify:center}THE VALUE OF THEIR PROPERTIES 
BY PUTTING THEM UP FOR SALE.

00:39:18.999 --> 00:39:22.999
{justify:center}YET THERE SEEMS TO BE 
A FLAW IN THE THEORY,

00:39:22.999 --> 00:39:25.834
{justify:center}FOR OWNING THEIR OWN 
HOMES HASNT MADE IT

00:39:25.834 --> 00:39:28.999
{justify:center}SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER FOR 
PEOPLE HERE TO BORROW MONEY.

00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:34.999
{justify:center}JUST 4% OF THEM HAVE MANAGED 
TO SECURE A MORTGAGE.

00:39:34.999 --> 00:39:36.999
{justify:center}THE REALITY IS THAT 
OWNING PROPERTY

00:39:36.999 --> 00:39:37.999
{justify:center}DOESNT GIVE YOU SECURITY.

00:39:37.999 --> 00:39:39.999
{justify:center}IT JUST GIVES YOUR 
CREDITORS SECURITY.

00:39:39.999 --> 00:39:43.250
{justify:center}REAL SECURITY COMES 
FROM HAVING AN INCOME.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.999
{justify:center}FOR THAT REASON, IT 
PROBABLY ISNT NECESSARY

00:39:45.999 --> 00:39:48.667
{justify:center}FOR EVERY ENTREPRENEUR 
IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD

00:39:48.667 --> 00:39:50.959
{justify:center}TO TAKE OUT A 
MORTGAGE ON HIS HOME

00:39:50.959 --> 00:39:52.999
{justify:center}OR FOR THAT MATTER ON HER HOME.

00:39:52.999 --> 00:39:56.834
{justify:center}IN FACT, PROPERTY OWNERSHIP 
MAY NOT BE THE KEY

00:39:56.834 --> 00:40:11.999
{justify:center}TO WEALTH GENERATION AT ALL.

00:40:11.999 --> 00:40:19.834
{justify:center}SHE RUNS A SMALL COFFEE SHOP 
IN EL ALTO, A POOR SUBURB OF 
THE BOLIVIAN CAPITAL LA PAZ.

00:40:19.834 --> 00:40:21.999
{justify:center}BETTY IS ONE OF AN INCREASINGLY 
LARGE NUMBER OF WOMEN

00:40:21.999 --> 00:40:26.999
{justify:center}AROUND THE WORLD 
WHO HAVE BORROWED MONEY 
WITH NO SECURITY AT ALL.

00:40:26.999 --> 00:40:31.999

OF AN EXTRAORDINARY 
NEW FINANCIAL MOVEMENT

00:40:31.999 --> 00:40:35.999
{justify:center}KNOWN AS MICROFINANCE.

00:40:35.999 --> 00:40:39.999
{justify:center}DID YOU BORROW THE MONEY TO 
SET UP THIS COFFEE STAND?

00:40:39.999 --> 00:40:45.999
{justify:center}[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:40:45.999 --> 00:40:47.999
{justify:center}[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:40:47.999 --> 00:40:49.999
{justify:center}IT WAS TO MAKE THE STAND.

00:40:49.999 --> 00:40:52.250
{justify:center}SHE BORROWED MONEY 
TO MAKE THE STAND.

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:54.999
{justify:center}HAVE YOU PAID-- AS 
SHE PAID IT ALL BACK?

00:40:54.999 --> 00:40:56.999
{justify:center}[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:40:56.999 --> 00:40:57.999
{justify:center}SHE PAID OFF WITH THIS BUSINESS

00:40:57.999 --> 00:40:59.999
{justify:center}ALREADY A LONG TIME AGO.

00:40:59.999 --> 00:41:02.999
{justify:center}OH, I SEE.

00:41:02.999 --> 00:41:05.999
{justify:center}STORIES LIKE BETTYS POINT TO 
ONE OF THE GREAT REVELATIONS

00:41:05.999 --> 00:41:08.999
{justify:center}OF THE MICROFINANCE MOVEMENT 
IN A COUNTRY LIKE BOLIVIA.

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:12.999
{justify:center}IT TURNS OUT THAT WOMEN 
ARE ACTUALLY A BETTER 
CREDIT RISK THAN MEN

00:41:12.999 --> 00:41:16.667
{justify:center}WITH OUR WITHOUT A HOME 
AS SECURITY FOR THE LOAN.

00:41:16.667 --> 00:41:19.999
{justify:center}IT ALL RATHER FLIES IN THE 
FACE OF THE CONVENTIONAL IMAGE

00:41:19.999 --> 00:41:23.999
{justify:center}OF THE SPENDTHRIFT FEMALE.

00:41:23.999 --> 00:41:28.959
{justify:center}THESE WOMEN ARE HARDLY WHAT YOU 
WOULD CALL GOOD FINANCIAL RISKS.

00:41:28.959 --> 00:41:31.250
{justify:center}THEY PROBABLY HAVE JUST A 
FEW DOLLARS BETWEEN THEM,

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:36.999
{justify:center}YET WITH NO SECURITY, 
THEYRE BEING LENT MONEY.

00:41:36.999 --> 00:41:39.999
{justify:center}HERE IN BOLIVIA, LENDERS 
HAVE COME TO REALIZE

00:41:39.999 --> 00:41:46.000
{justify:center}THAT CREDITWORTHINESS MAY, 
IN FACT, BE A FEMALE TRAIT.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
{justify:center}CARMEN VELASCO SET UP PRO 
MUJER TO PROVIDE FINANCE

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.999
{justify:center}TO POOR BUT ENTERPRISING WOMEN.

00:41:53.999 --> 00:41:55.999
{justify:center}BECAUSE THE LOANS ARE 
UNSECURED BY PROPERTY,

00:41:55.999 --> 00:41:59.999
{justify:center}THE CHALLENGE IS TO GET THE 
WOMEN TO PAY THEM BACK,

00:41:59.999 --> 00:42:01.999
{justify:center}BUT THEY DO.

00:42:01.999 --> 00:42:02.999
{justify:center}FROM DAY ONE, 
THEY HAVE TO KNOW

00:42:02.999 --> 00:42:05.999
{justify:center}THAT THEY HAVE 
TO REPAY ON TIME,

00:42:05.999 --> 00:42:07.999
{justify:center}THAT THEY HAVE INTEREST RATES,

00:42:07.999 --> 00:42:08.999
{justify:center}AND THEY HAVE TO SAVE.

00:42:08.999 --> 00:42:11.417
{justify:center}SO ITS A PROCESS OF LEARNING.

00:42:11.417 --> 00:42:12.999
{justify:center}AT THE BEGINNING, 
ITS VERY DIFFICULT

00:42:12.999 --> 00:42:15.999
{justify:center}BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT 
USED TO HANDLE A LOAN,

00:42:15.999 --> 00:42:17.999
{justify:center}BUT LITTLE BY LITTLE, 
THEY GET USED TO IT,

00:42:17.999 --> 00:42:25.999
{justify:center}AND THEY FEEL SO 
PROUD WHEN THEY REPAY.

00:42:25.999 --> 00:42:27.000
{justify:center}Ferguson: I MUST SAY 
IM HUGELY IMPRESSED

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.999
{justify:center}BY WHAT IM SEEING 
HERE AT PRO MUJER.

00:42:29.999 --> 00:42:31.999
{justify:center}YOU CAN SENSE IN 
THIS HIVE OF ACTIVITY

00:42:31.999 --> 00:42:35.000
{justify:center}THE TRANSFORMATION THAT 
MICROFINANCE HAS BROUGHT

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.999
{justify:center}INTO THESE WOMENS LIVES,

00:42:36.999 --> 00:42:39.999
{justify:center}AND BEHIND ME, YOU CAN 
SEE THE BOTTOM LINE,

00:42:39.999 --> 00:42:43.834
{justify:center}WOMEN LINING UP TO REPAY 
THEIR LOANS PUNCTUALLY.

00:42:43.834 --> 00:42:45.999
{justify:center}MAYBE ITS TIME TO CHANGE 
THAT OLD CATCH PHRASE

00:42:45.999 --> 00:42:52.417
{justify:center}FROM AS SAFE AS HOUSES TO 
AS SAFE AS HOUSEWIVES.

00:42:52.417 --> 00:42:53.999
{justify:center}OF COURSE, I WOULD BE 
A MISTAKE TO ASSUME

00:42:53.999 --> 00:42:57.999
{justify:center}THAT MICROFINANCE IS SOME KIND 
OF ECONOMIC MAGIC BULLET.

00:42:57.999 --> 00:43:03.999
{justify:center}JUST GIVING OUT LOANS 
WONT NECESSARILY CONSIGN 
POVERTY TO THE MUSEUMS,

00:43:03.999 --> 00:43:13.999
{justify:center}BUT THEN BETTING EVERYTHING ON 
THE HOUSE WONT DO THAT EITHER.

00:43:13.999 --> 00:43:15.999
{justify:center}FINANCIAL ILLITERACY 
MAY BE RAMPANT,

00:43:15.999 --> 00:43:20.999
{justify:center}BUT SOMEHOW, WE WERE 
ALL EXPERTS ON ONE 
BRANCH OF ECONOMICS,

00:43:20.999 --> 00:43:22.999
{justify:center}THE PROPERTY MARKET.

00:43:22.999 --> 00:43:27.999
{justify:center}WE ALL KNEW THAT PROPERTY 
WAS A ONE-WAY BET,

00:43:27.999 --> 00:43:33.999
{justify:center}EXCEPT THAT IT WASNT.

00:43:33.999 --> 00:43:38.999
{justify:center}ALL OVER THE WORLD IT SEEMS 
PROPERTY PRICES ARE FALLING

00:43:38.999 --> 00:43:48.417
{justify:center}FROM MEMPHIS TO SANTIAGO, 
FROM LONDON TO LA PAZ.

00:43:48.417 --> 00:43:50.834
{justify:center}ENCOURAGING HOME 
OWNERSHIP MAY WELL CREATE

00:43:50.834 --> 00:43:53.542
{justify:center}A POLITICAL CONSTITUENCY 
FOR CAPITALISM,

00:43:53.542 --> 00:43:55.999
{justify:center}BUT IT ALSO DISTORTS 
THE CAPITAL MARKET

00:43:55.999 --> 00:44:00.959
{justify:center}BY PERSUADING PEOPLE TO BET 
THE HOUSE ON, WELL, THE HOUSE.

00:44:00.959 --> 00:44:01.999
{justify:center}PEOPLE NEED TO BORROW 
MONEY OF COURSE

00:44:01.999 --> 00:44:04.999
{justify:center}TO START UP BUSINESSES OR 
TO BUY EXPENSIVE ASSETS,

00:44:04.999 --> 00:44:08.999
{justify:center}BUT IT SEEMS DANGEROUS TO LURE 
THEM INTO STAKING EVERYTHING

00:44:08.999 --> 00:44:11.250
{justify:center}ON THE FAR-FROM-RISK-FREE 
PROPERTY MARKET.

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:14.999
{justify:center}FROM BUCKINGHAMSHIRE TO 
BOLIVIA TO BONNY SCOTLAND,

00:44:14.999 --> 00:44:16.999
{justify:center}THE KEY IS TO STRIKE 
THE RIGHT BALANCE

00:44:16.999 --> 00:44:20.999
{justify:center}BETWEEN DEBT AND INCOME.

00:44:20.999 --> 00:44:22.999
{justify:center}AND ITS THAT BALANCE 
THAT WEVE MANAGED

00:44:22.999 --> 00:44:28.999
{justify:center}TO GET SERIOUSLY WRONG 
ON A GLOBAL SCALE.

00:44:28.999 --> 00:44:29.999
{justify:center}THIS EXTRAORDINARY PLACE

00:44:29.999 --> 00:44:38.999
{justify:center}IS THE SOUTHWESTERN 
STOCK EXCHANGE.

00:44:38.999 --> 00:44:41.999
{justify:center}ITS WHERE HUNDREDS OF 
CHONGQINGS RESIDENTS COME

00:44:41.999 --> 00:44:43.999
{justify:center}TO HAVE LUNCH, PLAY PING-PONG,

00:44:43.999 --> 00:44:47.999
{justify:center}AND INVEST, OR IS IT 
GAMBLE, THEIR SAVINGS

00:44:47.999 --> 00:44:49.125
{justify:center}ON THE STOCK MARKET.

00:44:49.125 --> 00:44:52.000
{justify:center}THIS IS WHAT DEFINES THE 
CHINESE ECONOMY TODAY.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.125
{justify:center}INCREASINGLY, ITS WHAT 
DEFINES THE WORLD ECONOMY--

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:58.417
{justify:center}CHINESE INVESTORS TRYING 
TO WORK OUT WHAT TO DO

00:44:58.417 --> 00:45:00.834
{justify:center}WITH THEIR ABUNDANT SAVINGS.

00:45:00.834 --> 00:45:03.125
{justify:center}AFTER YEARS OF INSTABILITY, 
CHINESE HOUSEHOLDS SAVE

00:45:03.125 --> 00:45:07.999
{justify:center}AN UNUSUALLY HIGH PROPORTION OF 
THEIR RAPIDLY RISING INCOMES

00:45:07.999 --> 00:45:09.999
{justify:center}IN MARKED CONTRAST 
TO AMERICANS,

00:45:09.999 --> 00:45:12.834
{justify:center}WHOSE SAVINGS RATE IS 
ONLY NOW BEGINNING TO RISE

00:45:12.834 --> 00:45:17.000
{justify:center}IN RESPONSE TO THE 
GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.999
{justify:center}SO PLENTIFUL ARE CHINESE SAVINGS

00:45:19.999 --> 00:45:21.417
{justify:center}THAT FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN CENTURIES

00:45:21.417 --> 00:45:26.000
{justify:center}THE DIRECTION OF CAPITAL 
FLOW IS NOT FROM WEST TO EAST

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.999
{justify:center}FROM EAST TO WEST,

00:45:28.999 --> 00:45:37.125
{justify:center}AND IT IS A MIGHTY FLOW.

00:45:37.125 --> 00:45:39.999
{justify:center}IN 2007, THE UNITED 
STATES NEEDED TO BORROW

00:45:39.999 --> 00:45:43.999
{justify:center}AROUND $800 BILLION FROM 
THE REST OF THE WORLD.

00:45:43.999 --> 00:45:47.999
{justify:center}THATS MORE THAN $4 
BILLION EVERY WORKING DAY.

00:45:47.999 --> 00:45:50.999
{justify:center}CHINA, BY CONTRAST, RAN A 
CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS

00:45:50.999 --> 00:45:54.999
{justify:center}EQUIVALENT TO MORE THAN A 
QUARTER OF THE U.S. DEFICIT,

00:45:54.999 --> 00:45:57.417
{justify:center}AND A REMARKABLY LARGE 
PROPORTION OF THAT SURPLUS

00:45:57.417 --> 00:46:04.417
{justify:center}HAS ENDED UP BEING LENT 
TO THE UNITED STATES.

00:46:04.417 --> 00:46:06.999
{justify:center}IN EFFECT, THE PEOPLES 
REPUBLIC OF CHINA

00:46:06.999 --> 00:46:17.125
{justify:center}HAS BECOME BANKER TO THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

00:46:17.125 --> 00:46:23.999
{justify:center}THE AVERAGE AMERICAN 
HAS AN INCOME OF 
AROUND $44,000 A YEAR,

00:46:23.999 --> 00:46:25.999
{justify:center}DESPITE THIS COUNTRYS A 
HUNDRED-PLUS BILLIONAIRES

00:46:25.999 --> 00:46:30.999
{justify:center}AND ALL THE OSTENTATIOUS 
SIGNS OF NEW MONEY HERE 
IN CENTRAL CHONGQING,

00:46:30.999 --> 00:46:32.417
{justify:center}IS ON AROUND $2,000.

00:46:32.417 --> 00:46:34.999
{justify:center}SO WHY WOULD THE LATTER 
WANT TO LEND MONEY

00:46:34.999 --> 00:46:38.999
{justify:center}TO THE FORMER, WHOS 
ROUGHLY 22 TIMES RICHER.

00:46:38.999 --> 00:46:47.999
{justify:center}WELL, HERES HOW IT WORKS.

00:46:47.999 --> 00:46:50.999
{justify:center}UNTIL RECENTLY FROM 
CHINAS POINT OF VIEW,

00:46:50.999 --> 00:46:53.999
{justify:center}THE BEST WAY OF EMPLOYING 
ITS VAST POPULATION

00:46:53.999 --> 00:46:55.999
{justify:center}WAS THROUGH EXPORTING 
MANUFACTURES

00:46:55.999 --> 00:46:59.834
{justify:center}TO THE INSATIABLY 
SPENDTHRIFT U.S. CONSUMER.

00:46:59.834 --> 00:47:02.667
{justify:center}TO ENSURE THAT THESE EXPORTS 
WERE IRRESISTIBLY CHEAP,

00:47:02.667 --> 00:47:06.000
{justify:center}CHINA HAD TO STOP ITS CURRENCY 
STRENGTHENING AGAINST THE DOLLAR

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:13.125
{justify:center}BY BUYING LITERALLY BILLIONS 
OF DOLLARS ON WORLD MARKETS...

00:47:13.125 --> 00:47:20.999
{justify:center}AND UNTIL RECENTLY, THIS SEEMED 
TO BE TO AMERICAS BENEFIT, TOO.

00:47:20.999 --> 00:47:23.959
{justify:center}HERE IN AMERICA, THE BEST WAY 
TO KEEP THE GOOD TIMES ROLLING

00:47:23.959 --> 00:47:28.999
{justify:center}IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN 
TO IMPORT CHEAP CHINESE 
GOODS BY THE CONTAINERLOAD

00:47:28.999 --> 00:47:32.417
{justify:center}AND SELL THEM IN 
OUT-OF-TOWN SUPERSTORES

00:47:32.417 --> 00:47:34.999
{justify:center}FOR COMPANIES LIKE WALMART, 
OUTSOURCING TO CHINA

00:47:34.999 --> 00:47:37.999
{justify:center}HAS BEEN A WAY OF 
REAPING VAST PROFITS

00:47:37.999 --> 00:47:39.000
{justify:center}FROM CHEAP CHINESE LABOR.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.999
{justify:center}IN 2006 ALONE, WALMART 
OUTSOURCED NO LESS

00:47:41.999 --> 00:47:45.999
{justify:center}THAN $9 BILLION WORTH 
OF GOODS FROM CHINA,

00:47:45.999 --> 00:47:48.999
{justify:center}BUT AT THE SAME TIME BY 
SELLING BILLIONS DOLLARS

00:47:48.999 --> 00:47:50.999
{justify:center}OF BONDS TO THE 
PEOPLES BANK OF CHINA,

00:47:50.999 --> 00:47:52.999
{justify:center}THE UNITED STATES HAS 
BEEN ABLE TO ENJOY

00:47:52.999 --> 00:47:56.000
{justify:center}MUCH LOWER INTEREST RATES 
THAN WOULD OTHERWISE 
HAVE BEEN THE CASE.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:03.999
{justify:center}ITS WHAT THEY CALL A BUSINESS 
SCHOOL A WIN-WIN SITUATION.

00:48:03.999 --> 00:48:06.999
{justify:center}THIS IS THE WONDERFUL DUAL 
COUNTRY OF CHIMERICA,

00:48:06.999 --> 00:48:10.999
{justify:center}ACCOUNTING FOR 33% OF THE 
WORLDS ECONOMIC OUTPUT

00:48:10.999 --> 00:48:20.999
{justify:center}AND MORE THAN HALF OF ALL GLOBAL 
GROWTH IN THE PAST 8 YEARS.

00:48:20.999 --> 00:48:24.999
{justify:center}CHIMERICA SEEMED LIKE A 
MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVEN.

00:48:24.999 --> 00:48:27.125
{justify:center}THE EAST CHIMERICANS 
DID THE SAVING,

00:48:27.125 --> 00:48:30.999
{justify:center}THE WEST CHIMERICANS 
DID THE SPENDING,

00:48:30.999 --> 00:48:35.959
{justify:center}BUT THERE WAS A CATCH.

00:48:35.959 --> 00:48:38.999
{justify:center}THE MORE CHINA WAS WILLING TO 
LEND TO THE UNITED STATES,

00:48:38.999 --> 00:48:41.999
{justify:center}THE MORE AMERICANS 
WERE WILLING TO BORROW.

00:48:41.999 --> 00:48:45.999
{justify:center}CHIMERICA, IN OTHER WORDS, 
WAS THE UNDERLYING CAUSE

00:48:45.999 --> 00:48:47.999
{justify:center}OF THE FLOOD OF 
NEW BANK LOANS,

00:48:47.999 --> 00:48:49.999
{justify:center}BOND ISSUES, AND 
DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

00:48:49.999 --> 00:48:56.999
{justify:center}THAT SWEPT PLANET 
FINANCE AFTER 2000.

00:48:56.999 --> 00:48:59.999
{justify:center}THAT IN TURN WAS THE 
UNDERLYING REASON

00:48:59.999 --> 00:49:03.999
{justify:center}WHY THE U.S. MORTGAGE MARKET 
WAS SO AWASH WITH CASH IN 2006

00:49:03.999 --> 00:49:06.999
{justify:center}THAT SUBPRIME MORTGAGES 
WERE BEING SOLD TO PEOPLE

00:49:06.999 --> 00:49:16.959
{justify:center}WITH NO INCOME, NO JOB, 
AND NO ASSETS--NINJAs.

00:49:16.959 --> 00:49:20.999
{justify:center}IT WASNT AS IF THE SUBPRIME 
MORTGAGE CRISIS OF 2007

00:49:20.999 --> 00:49:22.000
{justify:center}WAS HARD TO PREDICT.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.999
{justify:center}MONTHS BEFORE IT BLEW UP,

00:49:23.999 --> 00:49:25.999
{justify:center}I WAS IN TENNESSEE 
AND IN MICHIGAN

00:49:25.999 --> 00:49:28.542
{justify:center}SEEING FOR MYSELF HOW 
MANY POORER HOUSEHOLDS

00:49:28.542 --> 00:49:31.999
{justify:center}WERE HEADING FOR MORTGAGE 
DEFAULT AND FORECLOSURE.

00:49:31.999 --> 00:49:34.999
{justify:center}WHAT WAS MUCH HARDER TO 
PREDICT WAS HOW A SMALL TREMOR

00:49:34.999 --> 00:49:38.999
{justify:center}IN AMERICAS VERY OWN 
HOMEGROWN EMERGING MARKET

00:49:38.999 --> 00:49:46.000
{justify:center}WOULD CAUSE A FINANCIAL 
EARTHQUAKE ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
{justify:center}NOT MANY PEOPLE FORESAW THAT 
DEFAULTS ON SUBPRIME MORTGAGES

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.999
{justify:center}WOULD SEND SUCH A 
SHOCKWAVE AROUND THE WORLD

00:49:52.999 --> 00:49:56.999
{justify:center}THAT A BRITISH BANK WOULD 
SUFFER THE FIRST RUN SINCE 1866

00:49:56.999 --> 00:49:59.999
{justify:center}AND END UP BEING NATIONALIZED

00:49:59.999 --> 00:50:06.999
{justify:center}IN AMERICAN INVESTMENT BANKING, 
LEHMAN BROTHERS, WOULD GO BUST.

00:50:06.999 --> 00:50:12.999
{justify:center}FINANCIAL GLOBALIZATION HAS 
BEEN THE CULMINATING EPISODE 
OF THE ASCENT OF MONEY,

00:50:12.999 --> 00:50:17.250
{justify:center}BUT FOR ALL ITS BENEFITS, 
IT HAS ONE SERIOUS COST.

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:20.999
{justify:center}WITH THE FORTUNES OF THE WORLDS 
ECONOMIES SO INTERCONNECTED,

00:50:20.999 --> 00:50:26.999
{justify:center}WHEN THINGS GO WRONG, THEY 
CAN GO VERY WRONG INDEED.

00:50:26.999 --> 00:50:29.999
{justify:center}REMEMBER, WEVE 
BEEN HERE BEFORE.

00:50:29.999 --> 00:50:33.250
{justify:center}A HUNDRED YEARS AGO IN THE 
FIRST AGE OF GLOBALIZATION,

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:37.999
{justify:center}MANY INVESTORS THOUGHT 
THERE WAS A SIMILARLY 
SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP

00:50:37.999 --> 00:50:40.999
{justify:center}BETWEEN THE WORLDS 
FINANCIAL CENTER, BRITAIN,

00:50:40.999 --> 00:50:44.999
{justify:center}AND EUROPES MOST DYNAMIC 
INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY.

00:50:44.999 --> 00:50:46.999
{justify:center}THAT ECONOMY WAS GERMANYS,

00:50:46.999 --> 00:50:55.999
{justify:center}AND THE BREAKDOWN OF THAT 
RELATIONSHIP ENDED IN WAR.

00:50:55.999 --> 00:50:58.417
{justify:center}ON A DAY LIKE TODAY WHEN 
THE HONG KONG STOCK MARKET

00:50:58.417 --> 00:51:00.999
{justify:center}IS DOWN SHARPLY, 
ITS TEMPTING TO ASK

00:51:00.999 --> 00:51:03.999
{justify:center}WHETHER ANYTHING COULD 
TRIGGER A COMPARABLE BREAKDOWN

00:51:03.999 --> 00:51:06.999
{justify:center}IN GLOBALIZATION LIKE THE 
ONE THAT HAPPENED IN 1914.

00:51:06.999 --> 00:51:09.250
{justify:center}WELL, THE OBVIOUS ANSWER 
IS SOME KIND OF CONFLICT

00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:11.999
{justify:center}BETWEEN THE UNITED 
STATES AND CHINA,

00:51:11.999 --> 00:51:13.999
{justify:center}WHETHER OVER TRADE, 
TAIWAN, TIBET,

00:51:13.999 --> 00:51:17.999
{justify:center}OR SOME OTHER UNFORESEEABLE 
BONE OF CONTENTION.

00:51:17.999 --> 00:51:23.125
{justify:center}WHAT STARTS WITH COMPETITION 
FOR OLYMPIC MEDALS COULD 
END IN A BATTLE OVER DOLLARS

00:51:23.125 --> 00:51:29.999
{justify:center}IF THE CHINESE ONE DAY DECIDE 
TO CUT OFF THEIR CREDIT 
LINE TO THE AMERICAN EMPIRE.

00:51:29.999 --> 00:51:34.999
{justify:center}MAYBE, AS ITS NAME SUGGESTS, 
CHIMERICA IS NOTHING MORE

00:51:34.999 --> 00:51:38.999
{justify:center}THAN A CHIMERA, THE MYTHICAL 
BEAST OF ANCIENT LEGEND

00:51:38.999 --> 00:51:47.999
{justify:center}THAT WAS PART LION, 
PART GOAT, PART DRAGON.

00:51:47.999 --> 00:51:51.000
{justify:center}A CHINESE-AMERICAN CONFLICT 
MAY SOUND IMPLAUSIBLE,

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.125
{justify:center}BUT ONE OF THE KEY 
POINTS OF THIS SERIES

00:51:53.125 --> 00:51:56.999
{justify:center}IS THAT THE REALLY BIG CRISES 
COME JUST SELDOM ENOUGH

00:51:56.999 --> 00:52:00.417
{justify:center}TO BE BEYOND THE LIVING 
MEMORY OF THE PEOPLE WHO RUN

00:52:00.417 --> 00:52:05.667
{justify:center}TODAYS COMPANIES, 
BANKS, AND FUNDS.

00:52:05.667 --> 00:52:08.999
{justify:center}JUST BECAUSE ALL THE SWANS 
YOUVE EVER SEEN ARE WHITE

00:52:08.999 --> 00:52:14.999
{justify:center}DOESNT MEAN THERE 
ARE NO BLACK SWANS.

00:52:14.999 --> 00:52:21.999
{justify:center}[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

00:52:21.999 --> 00:52:32.000
{justify:center}TODAYS FINANCIAL WORLD IS 
THE RESULT OF 4 MILLENNIA 
OF ECONOMIC EVOLUTION.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:38.999
{justify:center}YET DESPITE THE UNPRECEDENTED 
COMPLEXITY AND DIVERSITY OF 
THE MODERN FINANCIAL SYSTEM,

00:52:38.999 --> 00:52:41.999
{justify:center}PLANET FINANCE REMAINS 
AS VULNERABLE AS EVER

00:52:41.999 --> 00:52:46.417
{justify:center}TO THE AGE-OLD PROBLEM 
OF BOOMS AND BUSTS,

00:52:46.417 --> 00:52:49.999
{justify:center}IRRATIONAL EXUBERANCE 
AND MANIC DEPRESSION.

00:52:49.999 --> 00:52:56.999
{justify:center}MAYBE ALL THIS COMPLEXITY 
HAS ACTUALLY INCREASED OUR 
VULNERABILITY TO CRISIS.

00:52:56.999 --> 00:52:59.959
{justify:center}FOR 4,000 YEARS FROM 
ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIA

00:52:59.959 --> 00:53:01.959
{justify:center}TO MODERN CHINA, 
THE ASCENT OF MONEY

00:53:01.959 --> 00:53:04.959
{justify:center}HAS BEEN ONE OF THE KEY 
FACTORS IN HUMAN PROGRESS,

00:53:04.959 --> 00:53:08.999
{justify:center}AN EXTRAORDINARY OF INNOVATION, 
INTERMEDIATION, AND INTEGRATION

00:53:08.999 --> 00:53:12.000
{justify:center}THAT HAVE DONE AS MUCH AS 
ANYTHING TO HELP PEOPLE ESCAPE

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.125
{justify:center}FROM THE DRUDGERY OF 
SUBSISTENCE AGRICULTURE,

00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:17.999
{justify:center}AND YET PLANET FINANCE 
CAN NEVER QUITE ESCAPE

00:53:17.999 --> 00:53:20.999
{justify:center}FROM THE GRAVITATIONAL 
FORCE OF PLANET EARTH

00:53:20.999 --> 00:53:23.999
{justify:center}BECAUSE THE QUANTS CAN 
NEVER TAKE FULL ACCOUNT

00:53:23.999 --> 00:53:27.999
{justify:center}OUR TENDENCY TO UNDERESTIMATE 
THE PROBABILITY OF BLACK SWANS,

00:53:27.999 --> 00:53:31.959
{justify:center}OUR PROPENSITY TO VEER FROM 
EUPHORIA TO DESPONDENCY,

00:53:31.959 --> 00:53:34.999
{justify:center}OUR CHRONIC INABILITY 
TO LEARN FROM HISTORY,

00:53:34.999 --> 00:53:36.999
{justify:center}AND THATS WHY THE COURSE 
OF FINANCIAL HISTORY,

00:53:36.999 --> 00:53:39.999
{justify:center}LIKE THAT MOST HUMAN 
OF EMOTIONS LOVE,

00:53:39.999 --> 00:53:42.417
{justify:center}NEVER RUNS SMOOTH 
AND NEVER WILL,

00:53:42.417 --> 00:53:44.999
{justify:center}NOT EVEN HERE ON THE MAGICAL

00:53:44.999 --> 00:54:16.999
{justify:center}AND QUITE POSSIBLE MYTHICAL 
COUNTRY OF CHIMERICA.

00:54:16.999 --> 00:54:34.999
{justify:center}CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE 
BY FRIENDS OF NCI

00:54:34.999 --> 00:54:37.542
{justify:center}FUNDING FOR THE 
ASCENT OF MONEY

00:54:37.542 --> 00:54:38.125
{justify:center}WAS PROVIDED BY...

00:54:38.125 --> 00:54:42.999
{justify:center}MY IDEA CREATED JOBS 
FOR 2,000 PEOPLE.

00:54:42.999 --> 00:54:46.667
{justify:center}MY IDEA WILL BRING 
RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:54:46.667 --> 00:54:50.999
{justify:center}AN ENTREPRENEUR WITH AN 
IDEA CAN CHANGE THE WORLD.
