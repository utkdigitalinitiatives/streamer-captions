00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.700
HELLO,
I'M ROGER BINGHAM.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.430
TONIGHT
WHILE YOU SLEEP,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.700
YOU'LL SEE YOUR OWN
PRIVATE MOVIE.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.160
YOU'LL BE THE WRITER, PRODUCER,
DIRECTOR, AUDIENCE,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.230
MAYBE EVEN
THE STAR.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.500
IT'LL SEEM REAL, BUT TOMORROW
IT MAY HAVE MELTED AWAY,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.260
LEAVING ONLY
TANTALIZING TRACES

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.960
BECAUSE IT WAS
JUST A DREAM.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.230
BUT WHAT ARE DREAMS?

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.660
ARE THEY OMENS
OR PROPHECIES?

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.260
CAN THEY GIVE US
INSIGHTS INTO OURSELVES?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
CAN WE LEARN HOW
TO USE THEM?

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.030
OR ARE THEY RANDOM, MEANINGLESS
IMAGES MADE BY THE BRAIN?

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.400
A KIND OF MENTAL FROTH
ON THE SURFACE OF SLEEP.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.860
WHY ARE WE IN THIS
MAGIC THEATER OF THE NIGHT?

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.530
AND WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE?

00:01:38.530 --> 00:02:18.430
♪ (MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.660
MOST OF US SLEEP
ABOUT EIGHT HOURS A NIGHT,

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.700
AND WE SPEND NEARLY TWO HOURS
OF THAT IN THE LAND OF DREAMS.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.360
IT'S A PLACE WHERE ANYTHING
CAN HAPPEN AND OFTEN DOES.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.460
A PLACE WHERE
WE MEET STRANGE PEOPLE,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.260
HAVE STRANGE CONVERSATIONS,
DO STRANGE THINGS.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.360
AND THEN WITH
THE LIGHT OF DAY,

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.360
WE RETURN WITH OUR
TRAVELER'S TALES.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.130
TALES OF JOURNEYS
INSIDE OUR OWN BRAINS.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.360
LET'S BEGIN WITH ONE OF THOSE
TALES, "JESSICA'S DREAM."

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.700
SHE DESCRIBES IT TO

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.830
PSYCHOLOGIST
DR. EARNEST ROSSI.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.900
IN THE DREAM
I'M ROWING ON THE OCEAN.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.660
I'M GOING ALONG
AND EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.530
AND SUDDENLY
THE WATERS PART.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.830
AFTER A WHILE MY BOAT IS
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.800
I GET OUT OF THE BOAT
AND LOOK AROUND.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.060
I CAN SEE THE CAVERNS
OF THE OCEAN,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.700
AND FISH ARE JUMPING AROUND
'CAUSE THEY HAVE NO WATER.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.630
THEN SUDDENLY
I HEAR A RUMBLE,

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.860
A VERY LARGE RUMBLE.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.800
IT'S FRIGHTENING LIKE
AN EARTHQUAKE ALMOST.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.430
AND THE SOUND GETS
LOUDER AND LOUDER.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.660
I BECOME VERY FRIGHTENED.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.260
I LOOK, AND IN
BOTH DIRECTIONS,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.300
I SEE THESE HUGE WALLS
OF WATER APPROACHING.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.900
I PUT MY HANDS DOWN.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.800
IN MY DREAM I DIE
BEFORE THE WATER CRUSHES ME.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.400
THE RUMBLING SOUND
IS SO GREAT THAT I DIE.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.400
THEN I WAKE UP.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.130
NARRATOR: WE'LL EXPLORE
JESSICA'S DREAM LATER.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.460
BUT FIRST, LET'S GO BACK TO THE
MAN WHOSE THEORIES OF DREAMING

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.000
WERE THE CORNERSTONE OF
PSYCHOANALYSIS, SIGMUND FREUD.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.760
DREAMS, FREUD THOUGHT,
WERE A KIND OF SAFETY VALVE

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.000
THAT ALLOWED US
TO LET OFF PSYCHIC STEAM

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.400
GENERATED BY TABOO DESIRES
IN OUR UNCONSCIOUS MINDS.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.600
THIS EXTRACT FROM A PIECE
CALLED "HUNGERS,"

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.230
BY VIDEO ARTIST ED EMSHWILLER,
SEEMS UNCANNILY FREUDIAN.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.330
THESE X-RATED EMOTIONS,
FREUD SAID,

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.300
WERE DISGUISED BY
AN INTERNAL CENSOR.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.660
THEN EMERGED,
HIDDEN BEHIND SYMBOLS

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.860
AND STRANGE STORIES
DURING DREAMS.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.400
IF WE COULD UNDERSTAND
THE DREAM'S SYMBOLISM,
FREUD BELIEVED,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.300
WE COULD DISCOVER
THE UNDERLYING MEANING.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.560
FREUD'S ONETIME
DISCIPLE CARL JUNG

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.230
HAD A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION
OF DREAM CONTENT.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.000
AGAIN, AN ARTIST'S
IMAGINATION

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.630
SEEMS TO ILLUSTRATE
THE ANALYST'S THEORIES.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.060
THIS VIDEO IS
BY DAVID EM.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.830
JUNG SAID WE ALL SHARE AN
ANCIENT COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS,

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.930
POPULATED WITH ARCHETYPAL
FIGURES AND SYMBOLS

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.360
THAT WE USE AS THE RAW
MATERIALS FOR OUR DREAMSCAPES.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.000
THE KEY POINT
IS THIS:

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.200
BOTH FREUD AND JUNG
BELIEVED THAT DREAMS

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:26.930
WERE MESSAGES SCRIPTED
AND PRODUCED BY THE UNCONSCIOUS.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.800
NARRATOR:
BY THE EARLY 1950'S,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.200
USING THE KIND OF TECHNIQUES
WE'RE SIMULATING HERE,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.160
RESEARCHERS WERE BEGINNING
TO CAST SERIOUS DOUBT

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.660
ON PURELY PSYCHOLOGICAL
THEORIES OF DREAMING.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.800
THEY LOOKED INSTEAD FOR
POSSIBLE BIOLOGICAL ROOTS
OF OUR NIGHT LIFE.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.530
VOLUNTEERS AT SLEEP LABS WERE
WIRED UP TO ELECTRODES

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.030
CONNECTED TO A MACHINE
THAT MEASURES

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.760
EYE AND MUSCLE MOVEMENTS,
HEART RATE,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.500
AND THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY
OF THE BRAIN, THE EEG.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.160
THIS IS THE SLEEP
DISORDERS CLINIC

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.330
AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.300
ONE OF A NATIONWIDE
NETWORK OF SLEEP LABS

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:11.400
EXPLORING THE FRONTIERS
OF THE NIGHT.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.660
GOODNIGHT,
ROGER.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.130
GOODNIGHT.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.160
NARRATOR: VOLUNTEERS ARE
CLOSELY OBSERVED AS THEY SLEEP.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:33.430
CAMERAS IN THE ROOM
RECORD THEIR MOVEMENTS.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.060
AND WHILE THE DREAMER
TAKES OFF

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.000
ON HIS NOCTURNAL FLIGHTS
OF THE IMAGINATION,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.930
INFORMATION FROM
THE MONITORING EQUIPMENT

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.930
IS RELAYED TO THE PINS
OF THE POLYGRAPH

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.230
THAT TRACE OUT
THE SIGNATURE OF SLEEP.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.300
THROUGH THE NIGHT, THAT
SIGNATURE CHANGES DRAMATICALLY.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.760
ON THE LEFT
IS DEEP SLEEP.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.260
THE EYES ARE
ACTUALLY STILL.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.860
THE LITTLE ACTIVITY YOU SEE
IS BEING CONDUCTED

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.260
THROUGH THE SKIN
FROM THE EEG.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.300
MUSCLE TONE IS REDUCED,
AND THE EEG SHOWS

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.730
CHARACTERISTIC LARGE,
SLOW BRAIN WAVES.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.330
ON THE RIGHT
IS REM SLEEP.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.800
THE EYE MOVEMENTS
ARE RAPID,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.460
HENCE THE TERM "RAPID EYE
MOVEMENT" OR "REM" SLEEP.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.800
AGAIN, MUSCLE ACTIVITY
IS REDUCED,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.360
BUT THE EEG SHOWS RAPID BRAIN
WAVES, LIKE AN AWAKE BRAIN.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.330
MOST OF US AWAKENED

REPORT HAVING
VIVID DREAMS.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.430
THE FIRST REM PERIOD BEGINS
AFTER ABOUT 90 MINUTES OF SLEEP.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.000
THEN ALTERNATES
WITH NON-REM SLEEP,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.030
REPEATING AT ROUGHLY THE
SAME 90-MINUTE INTERVALS
THROUGH THE NIGHT.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:50.500
EACH REM DREAM TIME IS LONGER
THAN THE ONE BEFORE.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.360
IF YOU GO TO SLEEP ABOUT 11:00,
YOUR FIRST REM PERIOD

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.900
SHOULD BE
HALF PAST MIDNIGHT.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.500
AND THE BEST TIME TO CATCH
YOUR LONGEST DREAM

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.100
WILL BE ABOUT 6:00
OR 6:30 IN THE MORNING.

NARRATOR: TO SCIENTISTS
THERE'S AN IMPORTANT CLUE HERE.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.060
IF WE HAVE SUCH A REGULAR
SLEEP AND DREAM CYCLE,

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.030
THEN PRESUMABLY IT'S
A NATURAL, BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.830
WE ALSO KNOW THAT REM SLEEP
DECREASES WITH AGE.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.860
INFANTS SLEEP ABOUT
16 HOURS A DAY.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.600
HALF OF THAT,
EIGHT HOURS, IS REM SLEEP.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.960
EVEN FETUSES IN THE WOMB
HAVE RAPID EYE MOVEMENTS.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.300
ALMOST ALL MAMMALS
HAVE REM SLEEP.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.400
ON THE OTHER HAND,
REPTILES DON'T.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.430
SO, IT SEEMS THAT DURING
THE TRANSITION

FROM REPTILES TO MAMMALS
REM SLEEP EVOLVED.

WE ARE IN A SENSE
PROGRAMMED TO DREAM.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.260
BUT WHY AND HOW?

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.300
10 YEARS AGO
HARVARD SCIENTISTS

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.260
ALLAN HOBSON
AND ROBERT MCCARLEY.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.660
SUGGESTED
A CONTROVERSIAL ANSWER.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.560
IT WAS ALREADY KNOWN THAT CELLS
IN AN AREA OF THE BRAIN STEM

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.260
ABOVE THE SPINAL CORD,
ARE ACTIVATED DURING REM SLEEP.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.060
ACCORDING TO HOPSIN
AND MCCARLEY,

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.260
THESE CELLS TRANSMIT A FLURRY
OF SIGNALS THAT TRIGGER

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.760
RESPONSES IN OTHER
PARTS OF THE BRAIN.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.800
THE CORTEX, TRYING TO MAKE
SENSE OF IT ALL,

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.900
THEN TRIES TO WEAVE
SOME KIND OF A STORY

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.500
OUT OF THE BOMBARDMENT
OF SENSORY INFORMATION.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.530
THE RESULT
IS A DREAM.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.200
NOTHING MORE THAN A SPIN-OFF
FROM NIGHTSHIFT NEURONS

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.460
CAUSING A COMMOTION
IN THE CORTEX.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.300
IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF FREUD'S
AND JUNG'S BELIEF

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.560
THAT THE UNCONSCIOUS
HAS A STORY TO TELL

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.060
AND THEN FINDS ILLUSTRATIONS
IN THE BRAIN'S IMAGE BANK.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.600
FOR THE SCIENTISTS, IMAGES COME
FIRST AND THE STORY FOLLOWS.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.130
THAT MAY BE WHY
TIME AND SCENES

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.530
CAN CHANGE SO SUDDENLY
IN DREAMS.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.200
IT'S SIMPLY
AN ABRUPT SHIFT

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:29.860
FROM ONE BRAIN CIRCUIT
TO ANOTHER.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.300
SOME SLEEP RESEARCHERS,

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.700
LIKE UCLA'S NEUROSCIENTIST
JERRY SIEGEL,

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.330
NOW BELIEVE THAT THE
HOPSIN-MCCARLEY IDEA
MAY BE SIMPLISTIC.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.330
SIEGEL ARGUES THAT HIGHER
REGIONS OF THE BRAIN,

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.200
INCLUDING THE CORTEX,
CAN PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.260
IN CONTROLLING REM SLEEP
AND DREAMING.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.230
REM SLEEP, ESSENTIALLY,
IS AN INTERACTION

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.800

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.500
THE HIGHER CENTERS ARE
INFLUENCING THE BRAIN STEM,

DURING WAKING AND REM SLEEP.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.160
SOME CELL GROUPS
SWITCH ON DURING REM.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:25.400
OTHERS SWITCH OFF.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.460
INFORMATION IS RELAYED
BETWEEN CELLS

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.660
BY CHEMICALS CALLED
"NEUROTRANSMITTERS."

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.360
SOME OF THESE MESSENGER
MOLECULES CAUSE CELLS TO FIRE.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.860
OTHERS INHIBIT THEM.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.000
SO, OUR DIFFERENT SHADES
OF CONSCIOUSNESS,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.060
FROM WAKING TO SLEEP
TO DREAMING, ARE THE RESULT

00:11:43.060 --> 00:12:02.530
OF EVER-CHANGING CONCENTRATIONS
OF BRAIN CHEMICALS.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.800
NARRATOR: THIS IS
WHAT CAN HAPPEN

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.630
WHEN THE FINELY TUNED MACHINERY
OF SLEEP AND DREAMS

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.260
DEVELOPS A GLITCH.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.000
THIS MAN TALKS IN HIS SLEEP
AND WALKS AROUND.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.160
ONE NIGHT SHE WOKE ME
AND I WAS SITTING

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.560
AT THE EDGE OF THE BED SAYING,
"KITTY, KITTY, KITTY."

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.030
AND SHE WAS SITTING
THERE LAUGHING AT ME.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.330
SHE SAID, "MEL,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.030
I SAID,
"PETTING THE CAT."

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.360
SHE SAID, "WE
HAVEN'T GOT A CAT."

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:39.760
THEN I WOKE UP
AND WENT BACK TO BED.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.760
NARRATOR: THIS TAPE PRODUCED
BY DR. CARLOS SCHENCK

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.930
OF THE MINNESOTA REGIONAL
SLEEP DISORDER CENTER

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:50.060
SHOWS PATIENTS WITH
REM SLEEP BEHAVIOR DISORDER.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.700
A PROBLEM THAT'S ONLY RECENTLY
BEEN IDENTIFIED IN HUMANS.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.730
BECAUSE THE CELLS
THAT WOULD NORMALLY

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.800
INHIBIT MUSCULAR ACTIVITY
FAIL TO FIRE,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.200
THESE PATIENTS ACT OUT THEIR
DREAMS, SOMETIMES VIOLENTLY.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.060
FORTUNATELY THEY CAN BE
HELPED BY DRUG THERAPY.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.130
IT'S ANOTHER INDICATION
THAT WE'RE BEGINNING

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.200
TO UNDERSTAND
THE BIOCHEMISTRY OF SLEEP.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.100
BUT DOES THAT MEAN
NEUROSCIENCE HAS UNLOCKED

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.230
THE MYSTERY OF DREAMS
AND THAT WE SHOULD

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.460
ABANDON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL
EXPLANATIONS OF FREUD OR JUNG?

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.300
JERRY SIEGEL.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.100
I DON'T THINK THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT WE'VE GAINED IN SLEEP

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.900
JUSTIFIES DISMISSING
DREAMS AS MEANINGLESS

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.500
OR EXPLAINING
THEM IN ANY WAY.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.460
WHAT WE'VE FOUND
IS THE BASIC MECHANISM.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.900
WE'VE ALSO FOUND THAT
CLEARLY THE ENTIRE BRAIN

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.600
OR LARGE PARTS OF THE BRAIN
ARE INVOLVED IN DREAMING.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.560
SO WHAT A NEUROSCIENTIST
CAN TELL YOU IS

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:57.860
THAT FOR SURE IT'S
NOT A SIMPLE PROCESS.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.030
NARRATOR: UNTIL RECENTLY
EXPLORING THE UNDERLYING

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.700
MECHANISMS OF SLEEP AND
DREAMING IN HUMANS WAS LIMITED.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.360
AS WE'VE SEEN, SLEEP LABS
PROVIDE A GENERAL PICTURE

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.800
OF BRAIN
AND MUSCLE ACTIVITY.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.430
FROM PHOTOGRAPHS LIKE THESE
TAKEN EVERY 15 MINUTES

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.800
THROUGH THE NIGHT
BY TED SPAGNA,

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:25.400
WE KNOW WHAT NORMAL
SLEEP LOOKS LIKE.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.500
SPANA, WHO PERFECTED
THE TECHNIQUE,

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.260
HAS WORKED CLOSELY
WITH SLEEP RESEARCHERS

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:40.130
TO DOCUMENT
OUR NIGHT MOVES.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.030
OF COURSE,
THESE ARE PHOTOGRAPHS

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.560
OF THE OUTSIDE
OF SLEEP AND DREAMS.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:58.130
HOW CAN WE PHOTOGRAPH
THE INSIDE?

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.630
NARRATOR: AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE,

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:05.400
RESEARCHERS ARE USING
POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY,

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.300
THE "PET" SCAN, TO EXPLORE
THE DREAMING HUMAN BRAIN.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.960
IN THIS SIMULATION, VOLUNTEERS
WIRED UP TO A POLYGRAPH

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:17.660
ARE MONITORED
WHILE THEY SLEEP.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.630
WHEN THE CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS
OF REM SLEEP APPEAR,

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.960
THE VOLUNTEERS ARE INJECTED
WITH A FORM OF GLUCOSE,

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.560
KNOWN AS AN "ISOTOPE."

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.500
BRAIN IMAGING LAB DIRECTOR
DR. MONTE BUCHSBAUM.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.930
THE ISOTOPE
IS ACTUALLY INJECTED

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.630
WHILE THE SUBJECT
IS DREAMING.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.730
THE BRAIN TAKES UP
THE ISOTOPE AND HOLDS IT

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.830
IN THOSE BRAIN CELLS
THAT ARE WORKING HARDEST.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.500
AT THE END OF ABOUT 25
OR 30 MINUTES ALL THE ISOTOPE

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.530
HAS BEEN TAKEN UP
FROM THE BLOOD

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:48.930
AND IS NOW SITTING
IN THE BRAIN,

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.030
MUCH AS A LATENT IMAGE WOULD
SIT ON A PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.860
OR ON YOUR
MAGNETIC TAPE.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.760
WE NOW CAN MOVE THEM
INTO THE "PET" SCAN,

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.030
IN ESSENCE DEVELOPING
THE PICTURE,

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.730
AND SHOWING THE BRAIN
ACTIVITY DURING THE DREAM.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.530
SO, WE HAVE
FROZEN THE DREAM,

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.500
THE MOMENT IN TIME WHEN
THE SUBJECT WAS DREAMING.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.430
THE RED, YELLOW AND WHITE
COLORS SHOW HIGH ACTIVITY.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.830
IN THESE SUBJECTS WHO
ARE DOING A VISUAL TASK,

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.360
WE CAN SEE THAT
THEY'RE EXERCISING

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.930
THE VISUAL LOBES
OF THE BRAIN.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.760
THIS SUBJECT HAS HIS EYES
CLOSED IN THE DARK.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.030
AND YOU CAN SEE
VERY LITTLE ACTIVITY

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.330
IN THESE SAME
VISUAL AREAS.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.200
SURPRISINGLY
DURING THE DREAM,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.200
AN ACTIVE DREAM
WITH VISUAL IMAGERY,

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.430
THE VISUAL AREA OF THE
BRAIN IS HARDLY ACTIVE.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.430
WE SEE THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE
BRAIN AND THE FRONTAL LOBES,

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.160
THE AREAS WHERE PERSONALITY,
THE ORGANIZATION OF BEHAVIOR,

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.960
AND PERHAPS THE IMAGINATION
ARE LOCATED.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.130
THESE ARE THE AREAS
WHICH ARE ACTIVE

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.960
AND ARE CREATING THE IDEAS
WE SEE IN THE DREAM.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.930
NARRATOR: BY MATCHING THE "PET"
SCAN IMAGES TO DREAM REPORTS,

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.560
THE IRVINE RESEARCHERS
SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND OUT

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.830
IF DIFFERENT
TYPES OF DREAMS

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.730
SWITCH ON DIFFERENT AREAS
OF THE BRAIN.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.030
BUT WILL THAT ALLOW THEM
TO DISCOVER THE MEANING
OF THE DREAMS?

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.930
PSYCHOLOGIST
RICHARD HAIER.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.800
I THINK THAT DREAM CTENT
WILL HAVE MEANING

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.730
UNIQUE TO THE INDIVIDUAL
BEYOND THE WAY

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:19.400
MOLECULES TWIST
OR SYNAPSES MOVE.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.360
A LOT OF THESE

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:27.200
PSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOMENA
LIKE DREAMS,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.560
WHILE THEY MAY HAVE
A BIOLOGICAL BASIS,

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.200
ALSO HAVE MEANING THAT CAN BE
DISCUSSED AND THOUGHT ABOUT

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.830
INDEPENDENT OF
THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.100
THAT'S WHAT FREUD DID.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.130
THAT'S WHAT
PSYCHOANALYSIS DOES,

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:46.100
AND PSYCHOANALYSIS
IS VERY GOOD AT THAT.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.360
WILL "PET" SCANNING
LEAD TO A BETTER

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.660
INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS
THAN A PSYCHOANALYST CAN DO?

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.130
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.400
I THINK THAT IF FREUD
WERE ALIVE TODAY,

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.430
HE'D BE HERE STUDYING
DREAMING WITH "PET" SCANNING

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.930
AND BRINGING
THE TWO TOGETHER.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:20.760
(PROJECTOR CLICKING)

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.660
NARRATOR: EVERY DAY OUR
SENSES ARE BOMBARDED

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.830
BY NEW INFORMATION THAT OUR
BRAIN'S HAVE TO PROCESS.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:30.230
SOME SCIENTISTS HAVE SUGGESTED
THAT LIKE AN OFF-LINE COMPUTER,

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.000
ONE THAT'S DISENGAGED
FROM THE EXTERNAL WORLD,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.200
OUR SLEEPING BRAIN'S
ARE CONSTANTLY

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.930
PROCESSING NEW IMAGES,

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:40.460
COMPARING THEM
WITH OLD MEMORIES,

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.160
AND UPDATING
THEIR PROGRAMS.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.000
MOST OF THE TIME WE'RE NOT
AWARE OF THIS MAINTENANCE WORK.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.830
BUT OCCASIONALLY GLIMPSES
OF THE NEW PROGRAMS

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.960
BEING RUN BY THE BRAIN'S
NIGHT SHIFT SURFACE.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.560
AND THOSE GLIMPSES
BECOME DREAMS.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.030
THAT'S JUST ONE
OF THE SPECULATIONS

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:02.230
ABOUT WHY WE HAVE
REM SLEEP AND DREAMS.

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:05.160
MANY OF THE THEORIES
USE COMPUTER ANALOGIES.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.260
DURING REM SLEEP,
THE BRAIN IS STILL ACTIVE,

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.030
BUT IT RECEIVES NO INPUT
FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:14.300
IN THE SAME WAY,
WHEN A COMPUTER RUNS

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:18.000
AND AMENDS EXISTING PROGRAMS,
IT'S TAKEN OFF-LINE.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
SOME SLEEP THEORISTS
HAVE SUGGESTED

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
THAT WITHOUT OUR OFF-LINE
NIGHTSHIFT CAPABILITIES,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.160
OUR BRAINS WOULD
HAVE BECOME OVERLOADED

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.930
TRYING TO HANDLE THE DAILY
TRAFFIC OF SENSORY INFORMATION.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.600
REM SLEEP MAY BE
MOTHER NATURE'S ECONOMICAL WAY

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.960
OF KEEPING US ON TOP OF THINGS
WITHOUT DRIVING US CRAZY.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.330
IT'S AN INTRIGUING IDEA,
BUT IS THERE ANY REAL EVIDENCE

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:57.700
THAT WE SPEND PART OF THE NIGHT
PROCESSING NEW DATA?

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.360
HOW DO WE PROVE THAT OUR
DAILY SENSORY EXPERIENCE

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.300
FINDS ITS WAY
INTO OUR DREAMS?

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.060
THAT'S WHAT RESEARCHERS HOWARD
ROFFWARG AND JOHN HERMANN

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.100
TRIED TO DO,
USING THESE.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.200
IT'S A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT,
BUT INGENIOUS.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.330
YOU SEE, THESE ARE ORDINARY
WELDER'S GOGGLES,

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.060
BUT THEY HAVE SPECIAL FILTERS
THAT LET ONLY RED LIGHT IN.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.830
SO, IT'S REALLY LIKE
LOOKING AT THE WORLD

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.930
THROUGH
ROSE-TINTED GOGGLES.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.230
VOLUNTEERS WORE THESE GOGGLES
FOR ABOUT A WEEK.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:31.830
AT NIGHT THEY WERE MONITORED
IN A SLEEP LAB.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.900
AND SURE ENOUGH, WHEN THEY
WERE AWAKENED FROM REM SLEEP,

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.700
IN THEIR DREAMS
THEY SAW RED.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.730
SO, IT SEEMS THAT
OUR DAILY EXPERIENCE

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.000
CAN BE REPLAYED IN
THE THEATER OF THE NIGHT.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.460
BUT WHY?

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.030
NOBLE PRIZE WINNER
FRANCIS CRICK HAS SUGGESTED

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.700
DREAMS ARE A KIND OF OVERNIGHT
CLEANING UP OPERATION.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.930
IN REM SLEEP, HE ARGUES,
THE BRAIN SORTS THROUGH

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:59.930
ITS LATEST SENSORY INPUTS
AND DUMPS ANYTHING THAT MIGHT

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:03.860
BECOME DTRACTING OR EVEN
DAMAGING IF IT WAS PERMANENTLY

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.060
STORED IN THE FILING SYSTEM
OF OUR MEMORIES.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.160
IT'S A BIT LIKE NIGHTLY
DEBUGGING OF A COMPUTER PROGRAM

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:20.260
TO PREVENT
FUTURE BREAKDOWNS.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.900
OTHER SCIENTISTS HAVE ARGUED
THAT REM SLEEP

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.530
IS A SORT OF PILOT LIGHT
FOR THE BRAIN.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.960
WITHOUT IT, WE MIGHT LAPSE INTO
TERMINAL LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.660
INSTEAD, IT PERIODICALLY
FIRES UP THE BRAIN CIRCUITS

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.630
IN PREPARATION FOR
FULL WAKING ACTIVITY.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.600
BUT PERHAPS
THE SPECULATION ABOUT DREAMS

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.400
THAT RESONATES BEST
WITH OUR INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.000
IS THAT THEY'RE A KIND
OF LEARNING PROCESS,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.800
A REHEARSAL FOR LIFE.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.400
MAYBE IN DREAMS
WE'RE PROBLEM SOLVING.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.230
LET'S GO BACK
TO JESSICA'S DREAM.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.060
IN MY DREAM I DIE
BEFORE THE WATER CRUSHES ME.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.430
THE RUMBLING SOUND
IS SO GREAT THAT I DIE.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.760
AND THEN I WAKE UP.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.230
NARRATOR: COULD THIS
BE THE PRODUCT OF CELLS

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:09.100
FIRING RANDOMLY
IN THE BRAIN STEM?

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.660
DID THEY SOMEHOW CONJURE UP
THE MEMORY OF A BOAT RIDE?

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.960
AND DID HER BRAIN,
TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT,

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.730
THEN INVENT THE REST
OF THE PLOT?

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.960
OR IS THIS A MESSAGE
FROM HER UNCONSCIOUS?

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.100
SHE'S HAD A DREAM
LIKE THIS SEVERAL TIMES

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.860
OVER THE PAST
FIVE YEARS.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.600
HOW AND WHY
DOES IT RECUR?

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.160
SCIENTISTS SPECULATE THAT
THE BIOCHEMICAL MECHANISMS

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.800
OF PERMANENT
MEMORY STORAGE

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.400
ARE SWITCHED OFF
DURING REM SLEEP,

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.730
SO, VERY
LITTLE STICKS.

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:43.030
THAT'S WHY WE FORGET
MOST DREAMS SO EASILY.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:45.800
BUT WHEN WE WAKE UP
DURING A DREAM,

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.360
OUR BRAIN CHEMISTRY CHANGES
AND THE IMAGES ARE STORED

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.200
IN THE ATTIC
OF OUR MEMORIES.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.160
BUT WHAT SHOULD WE DO
WITH OUR DREAMS?

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.260
LEAVE THEM THERE
LIKE UNWANTED GIFTS,

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.260
OR TAKE THEM DOWN,
AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND THEM?

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.660
DR. ROSSI.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.660
YOU TUNE INTO
YOUR DREAMS.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.760
YOU START
RECORDING THEM.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.700
YOU START WONDERING
ABOUT THEM,

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.760
AND SEE IF YOU DO NOT FIND
PATTERNS AND MEANINGFULNESS.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.000
MOST PEOPLE WHO DO
TAKE THE TASK SERIOUSLY

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
DO FIND THOSE PATTERNS.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.830
THE FASCINATING THING IS
THAT THE MEANING IS EVOLVING.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:26.030
IT'S CHANGING AS WE
OURSELVES ARE CHANGING.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:29.960
BOTH FREUD AND JUNG
HAVE TREMENDOUS GENIUS,

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.160
A TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT OF WISDOM.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.400
HOWEVER, WE CAN'T
SLAVISHLY FOLLOW THEM.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.560
OUR GENERATION AND
CONSCIOUSNESS ARE DIFFERENT.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.230
AND WE HAVE TO GO BACK
TO THE SOURCE WITHIN OURSELVES.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.000
SO THAT WOULD BE
THE IMPORTANT MESSAGE

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.730
I'D LIKE TO
COMMUNICATE.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:51.900
WE CAN LEARN FROM
MODELS OF THE PAST,

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.760
BUT IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS,
WHEN I HAVE THIS DREAM,

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:58.260
IT'S MY DREAM,
AND I HAVE TO REFLECT UPON IT

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.200
TO SEE WHAT MEANING
IS BEING CREATED.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.660
NARRATOR:
SO WHAT IS THE MEANING

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.600
OF JESSICA'S DREAM
OR YOURS OR MINE?

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.230
ACCORDING TO DR. ROSSI
IT'S NOT FIXED.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.930
THROUGH DIALOGUES
WITH OUR DREAMS,

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:26.760
WE CAN CONTINUALLY
CREATE NEW MEANING.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:32.330
(PROJECTOR CLICKING)

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:35.560
NARRATOR: AT THE BEGINNING
OF THIS PROGRAM

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.360
I COMPARED US TO PRODUCERS,
DIRECTORS, WRITERS, ACTORS,

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:42.100
AND AUDIENCES IN
THE THEATER OF THE NIGHT.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.330
TO A PSYCHOANALYST, MAYBE
THAT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.900
OF SAYING
"OUR UNCONSCIOUS."

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.900
TO MANY NEUROSCIENTISTS
BRAINS ARE US.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.700
OUR NIGHT THEATER
IS A PRODUCTION

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.630
OF OUR RESIDENT COMPANY
OF BRAIN CELLS.

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:00.630
SO HOW GOOD
WAS THE ANALOGY?

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.930
SURELY IF WE ARE
DREAM DIRECTORS,

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:05.460
WE CAN CHANGE A SCENE.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.660
IF WE ARE WRITERS,
WE CAN CHANGE THE SCRIPT.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.260
THAT'S EXACTLY THE NOTION
THAT SOME SLEEP RESEARCHERS

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.030
HAVE NOW BEGUN EXPLORING.

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:16.630
THEY ARGUE THAT
WE CAN LEARN

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.930
A TECHNIQUE CALLED
"LUCID DREAMING."

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:23.900
DURING A LUCID DREAM WE ARE
AWARE THAT WE ARE DREAMING,

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.430
AND WE MAY BE ABLE TO CHANGE
THE DREAM AS IT UNFOLDS.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:30.800
COULD THAT BE
A VALUABLE SKILL?

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.000
THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE
THAT OUR MENTAL ATTITUDES

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.700
CAN AFFECT
OUR BODILY WELL-BEING

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.460
VIA THE IMMUNE SYSTEM.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.830
IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT SIMILAR MECHANISMS

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.560
MIGHT OPERATE
AS WE SLEEP?

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.530
COULD WE LEARN
TO PRODUCE HEALING IMAGES

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:50.330
AND CONTROL
THE CHEMISTRY OF DREAMS?

00:25:50.330 --> 00:26:04.260
OR IS THAT
JUST A DREAM?

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.700
OUR JOURNEY
THROUGH THE LANDSCAPES

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.400
OF THE NIGHT
IS JUST BEGINNING.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.160
SCIENTISTS HAVE STARTED
TO MAP THE TERRAIN,

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.300
LOOKING FOR AREAS
IN OUR BRAIN

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.760
THAT MAY PRODUCE THESE
PRIVATE LATE SHOWS.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.260
BUT DREAMS
REMAIN AN ENIGMA.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.100
THEY'RE AS MUCH
POETRY AS PHYSIOLOGY.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.130
IN FACT, A POET MAY
HAVE PUT IT THE BEST.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.360
"WE ARE SUCH STUFF
AS DREAMS ARE MADE ON,"

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:33.630
"AND OUR LITTLE LIFE
IS ROUNDED WITH A SLEEP."
