00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600


2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.800
I tell you, he does sit in gold,

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.000
his eye red as 'twould burn Rome

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.970
and his injury the jailer to hispity.

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.530
I kneeled before him.

6
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.830
'Twas very faintly he said,"Rise,"

7
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.730
dismissed me thus, with hisspeechless hand.

8
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.630
You hear what he hath said whichwas sometime his general

9
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.730
who loved him in a most dearparticular.

10
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.630
He called me father.

11
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.600
But what of that?

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.130
Go, you that banished him,

13
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.870
a mile before his tent fall down

14
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.000
and knee the way into his mercy.

15
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.070
Nay, if he coyed to hearCominius speak,

16
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.070
I'll keep at home.

17
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.130
He would not seem to know me.

18
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.130
Do you hear?

19
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.000
Yet one time he did call me bymy name.

20
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.100
I urged our old acquaintance

21
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.430
and the drops that we have bledtogether.

22
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.670
Coriolanus he would not answerto,

23
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.070
forbad all names.

24
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.330
He was a kind of nothing,

25
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.900
titleless,

26
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.430
till he had forged himself

27
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.770
a name in the fire of burningRome.

28
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.300
Why, so.

29
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.530
You have made good work.

30
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.870
A pair of tribunes that haveracked for Rome

31
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.530
to make coals cheap, a noblememory.

32
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.400
I minded him how royal 'twas topardon

33
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.230
when it was less expected.

34
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.900
He replied, it was a barepetition of a state

35
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.700
to one whom they had punished.

36
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.600
Very well; could he say less?

37
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.630
I offered to awaken his regardfor his private friends.

38
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.530
His answer to me was,

39
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.900
he could not stay to pick them

40
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.070
in a pile of noisome, mustychaff.

41
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.270
He said 'twas folly for one poorgrain or two

42
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.000
to leave unburnt

43
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.970
and still to nose the offense.

44
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.970
For one poor grain or two.

45
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.500
I am one of those;

46
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.670
his mother, wife, his child,

47
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.600
and this brave fellow too, weare the grains.

48
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.200
You are the musty chaff,

49
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.570
and you are smelt above themoon.

50
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.330
We must be burnt for you.

51
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.400
Nay, pray, be patient.

52
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.730
If you refuse your aid in thisso never-needed help,

53
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.270
yet do not upbraid us for ourdistress.

54
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.800
But, sure, if you would be yourcountry's pleader,

55
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.330
your good tongue,

56
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.400
more than the instant army wecan make,

57
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.870
might stop our countryman.

58
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.000
No, I'll not meddle.

59
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.970
Pray you, go to him.

60
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.870
What should I do?

61
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.500
Only make trial what your lovecan do for Rome

62
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.000
towards Marcius.

63
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.870
Well, and say that Marciusreturn me,

64
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.600
as Cominius is returned,unheard; what then?

65
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.100
But as a discontented friendgrief-shot with his unkindness?

66
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.200
Say it be so?

67
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.300
Yet your good will must havethat thanks from Rome,

68
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.970
after the measure as youintended well.

69
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.870
I'll undertake it.

70
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.230
I think he'll hear me.

71
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.700
And the glorious gods love theeno worse

72
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.800
than thy old father Meneniusdoes.

73
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.270
O, my son; my son.

74
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.300
Thou art preparing fire for us.

75
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.070
Look thee, here is water toquench it.

76
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.270
I was hardly moved to come tothee,

77
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.130
but being assured that none butmyself could move thee,

78
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.200
I have been blown out of thygates with sighs

79
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.700
and conjure thee to pardon Rome

80
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.970
and thy petitionary countrymen.

81
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.670
Away.

82
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.830
How, away?

83
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.530
Wife, mother, child,

84
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.270
I know not.

85
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.270
My affairs are servanted toothers.

86
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.200
Though I owe my revengeproperly,

87
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.400
my remission lies in Volscianbreasts.

88
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.770
That we have been familiar,

89
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.100
ingrate forgetfulness shallpoison

90
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.700
rather than pity note how much.

91
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.800
Therefore, be gone.

92
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.530
My ears against your suits arestronger

93
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.600
than your gates against myforce.

94
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.100
Yet, for I loved thee, take thisalong.

95
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.670
I writ it for thy sake and wouldhave sent it.

96
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.070
Another word, Menenius, I willnot hear thee speak.

97
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.130
This man, Aufidius,

98
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.670
was my beloved in Rome.

99
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.270
Yet thou behold'st.

100
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.400
You keep a constant temper.

101
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.030
See you yond coign of thecapitol,

102
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.670
yond cornerstone?

103
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.470
Why, what of that?

104
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.470
If it be possible

105
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.030
for you to displace it with yourlittle finger,

106
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.030
there is some hope that theladies of Rome,

107
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.230
especially his mother, mayprevail with him.

108
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.370
But I say there is no hope init.

109
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.430
Our throats are sentenced andstay upon execution.

110
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.630
Is it possible that so short atime

111
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.670
can alter the condition of aman?

112
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.730
There is differency between agrub and a butterfly,

113
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.600
yet your butterfly was a grub.

114
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.000
This Marcius is grown from manto dragon.

115
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.400
He has wings.

116
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.570
He is more than a creepingthing.

117
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.700
He loved his mother dearly.

118
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.330
So did he me.

119
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.530
And he no more remembers hismother now

120
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.130
than an eight-year-old horse.

121
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.970
The tartness of his face soursripe grapes.

122
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.470
He sits in his state like athing made for Alexander.

123
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.370
What he bids be done is finishedwith his bidding.

124
00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.470
He wants nothing of a god buteternity

125
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.130
and a heaven to throne in.

126
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.270
Yes, mercy, if you report himtruly.

127
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.230
I paint him in the character.

128
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.200
Mark what mercy his mother shallbring from him.

129
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.830
There's no more mercy in him

130
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.370
than there is milk in a maletiger,

131
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.930
that shall our poor city find,

132
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.670
and all this is long of you.

133
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.870
The gods be good unto us.

134
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.800
No, in such a case, the godswill not be good unto us.

135
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.570
When we banished him, werespected not them,

136
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.300
and, he returning to break ournecks,

137
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.000
they respect not us.

138
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.700
This last old man,

139
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.100
whom with a cracked heart I havesent to Rome,

140
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.170
loved me above the measure of afather,

141
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.770
nay, godded me, indeed.

142
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.300
Their latest refuge was to sendhim,

143
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.930
for whose old love I have,though I showed sourly to him,

144
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.170
once more offered the firstconditions,

145
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:09.100
which they did refuse and cannotnow accept

146
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.270
to grace him only that thoughthe could do more,

147
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.270
a very little I have yielded to.

148
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.170
Fresh embassies and suits,

149
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.170
nor from the state nor privatefriends

150
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.030
hereafter will I lend ear to.

151
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.270
My wife comes foremost,

152
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:43.870
then the honored mold whereinthis trunk was framed

153
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.100
and in her hand the grandchildto her blood.

154
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.370
But out, affection.

155
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.570
All bond and privilege of naturebreak.

156
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.970
Let it be virtuous to beobstinate.

157
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:08.570
What is that curt'sy worth,

158
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:13.100
or those doves' eyes which canmake gods forsworn?

159
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:20.530
I melt and am not of strongerearth than others.

160
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:27.070
My mother bows as if Olympus toa molehill

161
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.730
should in supplication nod,

162
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:34.100
and my young boy hath an aspectof intercession

163
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:39.170
which great nature cries, "Denynot."

164
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:46.170
Let the Volsces plow Rome andharrow Italy.

165
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:50.030
I'll never be such a gosling toobey instinct

166
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.270
but stand as if a man wereauthor of himself

167
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.870
and knew no other kin.

168
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:03.200
My lord and husband.

169
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.830
These eyes are not the same Iwore in Rome.

170
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:12.200
The sorrow that delivers us thuschanged makes you think so.

171
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.130
Like a dull actor now, I haveforgot my part,

172
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.100
and I am out, even to a fulldisgrace.

173
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:28.670
Best of my flesh, forgive mytyranny,

174
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.100
but do not say for that,"Forgive our Romans."

175
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.100
O, a kiss long as my exile,

176
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.870
sweet as my revenge.

177
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.600
Now, by the jealous queen ofHeaven,

178
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.200
that kiss I carried from thee,dear,

179
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.530
and my true lip hath virgined itever since.

180
00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.070
Ye gods, I prate,

181
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.670
and the most noble mother in theworld leave unsaluted.

182
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.300
Sink my knee in the earth.

183
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.530
Of thy deep duty,

184
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.630
more impression show than thatof common sons.

185
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.570
O, stand up blest.

186
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.100
Whilst, with no softer cushionthan the flint,

187
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.530
I kneel before thee andunproperly show duty,

188
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:21.470
as mistaken all this whilebetween the child and parent.

189
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:22.670
What's this?

190
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:23.970
Your knees to me?

191
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.430
To your corrected son?

192
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.330
Then let the pebbles on thehungry beach

193
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.070
fillip the stars,

194
00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.500
then let the mutinous winds

195
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.170
strike the proud cedars 'gainstthe fiery sun,

196
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.000
murdering impossibility

197
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.500
to make what cannot be slightwork.

198
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.830
Thou art my warrior.

199
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.300
I holp to frame thee.

200
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.200
Do you know this lady?

201
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.400
The noble sister of Publicola,

202
00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.470
the moon of Rome,

203
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.230
chaste as the icicle that'scurdied by the frost

204
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:06.770
from purest snow and hangs onDian's temple.

205
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.500
Dear Valeria.

206
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.000
This is a poor epitome of yours,

207
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.700
which by the interpretation offull time

208
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.600
may show like all yourself.

209
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.970
The god of soldiers,

210
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.470
with the consent of supremeJove,

211
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:28.830
inform thy thoughts withnobleness.

212
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.500
Your knee, sirrah.

213
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.570
That's my brave boy.

214
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:44.400
Even he, your wife, this lady,and myself are suitors to you.

215
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.900
I beseech you, peace.

216
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.770
Or, if you'd ask, remember thisbefore:

217
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.730
The thing I have forsworn togrant

218
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.530
may never be held by youdenials.

219
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:56.300
Bid me not dismiss my soldiers

220
00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.600
or capitulate again with Rome'smechanics.

221
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.930
Tell me not wherein I seemunnatural.

222
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.800
Desire not to ally my rages andrevenges

223
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.600
with your colder reasons.

224
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.230
O, no more; no more.

225
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.370
You have said you will not grantus any thing

226
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:11.600
for we have nothing else to ask

227
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.200
but that which you deny already,

228
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.800
yet we will ask

229
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.230
that if you fail in our request,

230
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.400
the blame may hang upon yourhardness.

231
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.070
Therefore, hear us.

232
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:32.100
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark,

233
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.800
for we'll hear nought from Romein private.

234
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.430
Your request?

235
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.100
Should we be silent and notspeak,

236
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.530
our raiment and state of bodies

237
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.600
would bewray what life we haveled since thy exile.

238
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.570
Think with thyself how moreunfortunate

239
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.330
than all living women are wecome hither.

240
00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.070
Since that thy sight,

241
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.130
which should make our eyes flowwith joy,

242
00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:02.770
hearts dance with comforts,

243
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:06.230
constrains them weep and shakewith fear and sorrow,

244
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.300
making the mother, wife, andchild

245
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:16.430
to see the son, the father, thehusband

246
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.230
tearing his country's bowelsout.

247
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.770
And to poor we thine enmity'smost capital.

248
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.000
Thou barr'st us our prayers tothe gods,

249
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.900
which is a comfort that all butwe enjoy,

250
00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:37.930
for how can we

251
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:43.770
alas,

252
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.400
how can we for our country pray

253
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.400
whereto we are bound,

254
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.030
together with thy victory,

255
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.000
whereto we are bound?

256
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.900
Alack, or we must lose thecountry, our dear nurse,

257
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.130
or else thy person,

258
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.900
our comfort in the country.

259
00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:07.070
We must find an evidentcalamity,

260
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.700
though we had our wish whichside should win.

261
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.200
For either thou must, as aforeign recreant,

262
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.400
be led with manacles thoroughour streets,

263
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.670
or else triumphantly tread onthy country's ruin

264
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.800
and bear the palm for havingbravely shed

265
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.430
thy wife and children's blood.

266
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.830
For myself, son,

267
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:34.400
I purpose not to wait on fortunetill these wars determine.

268
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.470
If I cannot persuade thee ratherto show a noble grace

269
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:45.200
to both sides than seek the endof one,

270
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.000
thou shalt no sooner march toassault thy country

271
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.600
than to tread trust to it, thoushalt not

272
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.500
on thy mother's womb thatbrought thee to this world.

273
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.970
Ay, and mine that brought youforth this boy

274
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.870
to keep your name living totime.

275
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.470
A' shall not tread on me.

276
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.530
I'll run away till I am bigger,

277
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.270
but then I'll fight.

278
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.130
Not of a woman's tenderness tobe

279
00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.530
requires nor child nor woman'sface to see.

280
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:16.930
I have sat too long.

281
00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.830
Nay, go not from us thus.

282
00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.370
If it were so that our requestdid tend to save the Romans

283
00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.070
thereby to destroy the Volsceswhom you serve,

284
00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.600
you might condemn us aspoisonous of your honor.

285
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.370
No.

286
00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.170
Our suit is that you reconcilethem.

287
00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.470
while the Volsces may say, "Thismercy we've showed,"

288
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:42.330
the Romans, "This we received,"

289
00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:46.300
and each in either side give theall hail to thee

290
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:51.470
and cry, "Be blest for making upthis peace."

291
00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.770
Thou know'st, great son, the endof war's uncertain,

292
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.900
but this certain,

293
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.170
that if thou conquer Rome,

294
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.370
the benefit which thou shaltthereby reap

295
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.000
is such a name whose repetition

296
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.070
shall be dogged with curses,

297
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.730
whose chronicle thus writ:

298
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.130
"The man was noble,

299
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.230
"but with his last attempt, hewiped it out,

300
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.130
"destroyed his country,

301
00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:28.000
and his name remains to theensuing age abhorred."

302
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.470
Speak to me, son.

303
00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.970
Thou hast affected the finestrains of honor,

304
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.330
to imitate the graces of thegods,

305
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.700
to tear with thunder the widecheeks of the air,

306
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.400
and yet to charge thy sulphurwith a bolt

307
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.400
that should but rive an oak.

308
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:18.000
Why dost not speak?

309
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.470
Think'st thou it honorable for anoble man

310
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:25.230
still to remember wrongs?

311
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.330
Daughter, speak you.

312
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.330
He cares not for your weeping.

313
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.370
Thou hast never in thy life

314
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.300
showed thy dear mother anycourtesy

315
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.400
when she, poor hen fond of nosecond brood,

316
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.330
has clucked thee to the wars andsafely home,

317
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.200
loaden with honor.

318
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.630
Say my request's unjust andspurn me back,

319
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:53.970
but if it be not so,

320
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.300
thou art not honest

321
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.270
and the gods will plague theethat thou restrain'st from me

322
00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.530
the duty which to a mother'spart belongs.

323
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.500
He turns away.

324
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.900
Down, ladies.

325
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.870
Let us shame him with our knees.

326
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.500
To his surname, Coriolanus,

327
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.300
'longs more pride than pity toour prayers.

328
00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:37.830
Down.

329
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:50.830
An end.

330
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.270
This is the last.

331
00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:06.500
So we will home to Rome and dieamong our neighbors.

332
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.770
Nay, behold us.

333
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.370
This boy that cannot tell whathe would have

334
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.430
but kneels and holds up handsfor fellowship

335
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.270
does reason our petition withmore strength

336
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.900
than thou hast to deny it.

337
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.370
Come, let us go.

338
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.070
This fellow had a Volscian tohis mother.

339
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.730
His wife is in Corioli

340
00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:49.030
and his child like him bychance.

341
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.070
Nay.

342
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:03.800
Give us our dispatch.

343
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:22.630
I am hushed until our city beafire,

344
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.000
and then I'll speak a little.

345
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.630
O, mother.

346
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.430
Mother.

347
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.030
What have you done?

348
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.170
Behold, the heavens do ope,

349
00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:21.130
the gods look down,

350
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:27.800
and this unnatural scene

351
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.030
they laugh at.

352
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.300
O, my mother.

353
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.100
Mother.

354
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:40.900
O.

355
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:46.100
You have won a happy victory toRome,

356
00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.300
but, for your son

357
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:52.330
Believe it; O, believe it,

358
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.800
most dangerously you have withhim prevailed,

359
00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:01.330
if not most mortal to him.

360
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:10.370
But, let it come.

361
00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:25.970
Aufidius,

362
00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:29.230
though I cannot make true wars,

363
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.930
I'll frame convenient peace.

364
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.530
And, good Aufidius, were you inmy stead,

365
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.930
would you have heard a motherless

366
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:46.070
or granted less, Aufidius?

367
00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.800
I was moved withal.

368
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.830
I dare be sworn you were.

369
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.900
And, sir, it is no little thing

370
00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:03.470
to make mine eyes to sweatcompassion.

371
00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.300
What, good sir, what peaceyou'll make,

372
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.200
advise me.

373
00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.570
For my part, I'll not to Rome,

374
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:18.770
I'll back with you and pray you,

375
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:21.170
stand to me in this cause.

376
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:26.400
O, mother.

377
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.500
Wife.

378
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.500
I am glad thou hast set thymercy and thy honor

379
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.000
at difference in thee.

380
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:45.400
Out of that, I'll work myself aformer fortune.

381
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:50.400
Behold our patroness, the lifeof Rome.

382
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.900
Call all your tribes together,praise the gods,

383
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.300
and make triumphant fires.

384
00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.430
Strew flowers before them.

385
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:04.100
Unshout the noise that banishedMarcius,

386
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.570
repeal him with the welcome ofhis mother,

387
00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:11.600
cry, "Welcome, ladies; welcome."

388
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.800
Welcome, ladies;

389
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.300
welcome.

390
00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:23.900
Go tell the lords of the city Iam here.

391
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.230
Deliver them this paper.

392
00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:28.970
Most noble sir,

393
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:33.400
if you do hold the same intentwherein you wished us parties,

394
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.800
we'll deliver you of your greatdanger.

395
00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.900
Sir, I cannot tell.

396
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.500
We must proceed as we do findthe people.

397
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.630
The people will remain uncertain

398
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.630
whilst 'twixt you there'sdifference,

399
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:51.170
but the fall of either makes thesurvivor heir of all.

400
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.330
I know it,

401
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:57.370
and my pretext to strike at himadmits a good construction.

402
00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.730
He came unto my hearth,

403
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.330
presented to my knife histhroat.

404
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:03.670
I took him;

405
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.530
made him joint servant with me;

406
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.730
gave him way in all his owndesires;

407
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:09.530
nay, let him choose out of myranks

408
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.100
his projects to accomplish,

409
00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.270
my best and freshest men;

410
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:18.400
served his designments in mineown person;

411
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:24.630
holp to reap the fame which hedid end all his;

412
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:28.470
and took some pride to do myselfthis wrong.

413
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:29.600
Till, at the last,

414
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:34.370
I seemed his follower notpartner,

415
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.670
and he waged me with hiscountenance

416
00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:38.600
as if I had been mercenary.

417
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.070
So he did, my lord.

418
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.470
The army marveled at it, and, inthe last,

419
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:43.900
when he had carried Rome

420
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.230
and that we looked for no lessspoil than gloryó

421
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.470
There was it.

422
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:52.100
For the which my sinews shall bestretched upon him.

423
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.300
At a few drops of women's rheum,

424
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.630
which are as cheap as lies,

425
00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:01.630
he sold the blood and labor ofour great action.

426
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:12.000
Therefore shall he die and I'llrenew me in his fall.

427
00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:19.430
Hail, lords.

428
00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:27.400
I am returned your soldier,

429
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.570
no more infected with mycountry's love

430
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:30.670
than when I parted hence

431
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:34.530
but still subsisting under yourgreat command.

432
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.330
You are to know

433
00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:38.170
that prosperously I haveattempted

434
00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:39.470
and with bloody passage

435
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:42.970
led your wars even to the gatesof Rome.

436
00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:46.570
Our spoils we have brought homedoth more than counterpoise

437
00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:50.170
a full third part the charges ofthe action.

438
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:54.770
We have made peace

439
00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:57.130
with no less honor to theAntiates

440
00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:58.730
than shame to the Romans

441
00:26:58.730 --> 00:26:59.900
and here deliver,

442
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.200
subscribed by the consuls andpatricians,

443
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.670
together with the seal of thesenate,

444
00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:08.270
what we have compounded on.

445
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:17.470
Read it not, noble lords,

446
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:20.400
but tell the traitor in thehighest degree

447
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.870
he hath abused your powers.

448
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.370
Traitor?

449
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:26.370
How now?

450
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.270
Ay, traitor, Marcius.

451
00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.270
Marcius.

452
00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.600
Ay, Marcius,

453
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.970
Caius Marcius.

454
00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:35.870
Dost thou think I'll grace theewith that robbery,

455
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:41.530
thy stolen name Coriolanus inCorioli?

456
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.500
You lords and heads of thestate,

457
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.470
perfidiously he has betrayedyour business and given up,

458
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:52.530
for certain drops of salt, yourcity Rome.

459
00:27:52.530 --> 00:28:00.770
I say "your city," to his wifeand mother,

460
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:04.530
breaking his oath and resolutionlike a twist of rotten silk,

461
00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:06.870
never admitting counsels of thewar,

462
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.530
but at his nurse's tears,

463
00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:13.970
he whined and roared away yourvictory

464
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.230
that pages blushed at him

465
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:19.800
and men of heart lookedwondering each at other.

466
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.970
Hear'st thou, Mars?

467
00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:25.830
Name not the god, thou boy oftears.

468
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:28.470
No more.

469
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.170
Measureless liar,

470
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.970
thou hast made my heart toogreat for what contains it.

471
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:36.900
Boy.

472
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.900
O, slave.

473
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.130
Pardon me, lords.

474
00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:44.570
'Tis the first time that ever Iwas forced to scold.

475
00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:49.600
Your judgments, my grave lords,Must give this cur the lie

476
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.200
and his own notion,

477
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.700
who wears my stripes impressedupon him,

478
00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.470
that must bear my beating to hisgrave,

479
00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.700
shall join to thrust the lieunto him.

480
00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.430
Cut me to pieces, Volsces.

481
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:09.470
Men and lads, stain all youredges on me.

482
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:10.900
Boy.

483
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.400
False hound.

484
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.100
If you have writ your annalstrue,

485
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.470
'tis there that, like an eaglein a dovecote,

486
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:21.500
I fluttered your Volscians inCorioli.

487
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.500
Alone I did it.

488
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.500
Boy.

489
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.500
Why, noble lords,

490
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.770
will you be put in mind of hisblind fortune,

491
00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:28.800
which was your shame,

492
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.300
by this unholy braggart?

493
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.670
Peace, ho.

494
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.070
No outrage.

495
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.570
Peace.

496
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:36.630
The man is noble

497
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:39.370
and his fame folds in this orbof the earth.

498
00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:42.130
His last offenses to us shallhave judicious hearing.

499
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.800
Stand, Aufidius, and trouble notthe peace.

500
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:49.370
O, that I had him, with sixAufidiuses

501
00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:55.400
or more, his tribe, to use mylawful sword.

502
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.930
Insolent villain.

503
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:09.730
Kill.

504
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:28.900
Kill.

505
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.270
Kill.

506
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:36.530
Kill.

507
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.600
Kill.

508
00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.500
Kill.

509
00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:42.970
Kill.

510
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Kill.

511
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.070
Kill.

512
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:51.870
Kill.

513
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:56.430
Kill!

514
00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.700
My lords,

515
00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.700
when you shall know

516
00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:22.700
as in this rage, provoked byhim, you cannot

517
00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:26.970
the great danger this man's lifedid owe you,

518
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:31.730
you'll rejoice that he is thuscut off.

519
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.130
My rage is gone,

520
00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.170
and I am struck with sorrow.

521
00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:44.900
Though in this city

522
00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.400
he hath widowed and unchildedmany a one

523
00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:54.730
which to this hour bewail theinjury,

524
00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:58.200
yet he shall have a noblememory.

525
00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.400
