00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.700


2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.570
The sun begins to gild the western sky;

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.570
And now it is about the very hour

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:20.930
That Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me.

5
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.230
She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,

6
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.730
Unless it be to come before their time;

7
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.630
So much they spur their expedition.

8
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.970
See where she comes.

9
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.100
Lady, a happy evening!

10
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.330
Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,

11
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:

12
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.230
I fear I am attended by some spies.

13
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.330
Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off;

14
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.430
If we recover that, we are sure enough.

15
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.070
Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?

16
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.770
O, sir, I find her milder than she was;

17
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.730
And yet she takes exceptions at your person.

18
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.800
What, that my leg is too long?

19
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.300
No; that it is too little.

20
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.130
I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder.

21
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.170
But love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes.

22
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.400
What says she to my face?

23
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.830
She says it is a fair one.

24
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.700
Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.

25
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.800
But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,

26
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.430
Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.

27
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.400
'Tis true; such pearls as put out ladies' eyes;

28
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.030
For I had rather wink than look on them.

29
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.570
How likes she my discourse?

30
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.070
Ill, when you talk of war.

31
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.300
But well, when I discourse of love and peace?

32
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.400
But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.

33
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.100
What says she to my valour?

34
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.200
O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.

35
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.630
She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.

36
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.170
What says she to my birth?

37
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.300
That you are well derived.

38
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.300
True; from a gentleman to a fool.

39
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.570
Considers she my possessions?

40
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.330
O, ay; and pities them.

41
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.170
Wherefore?

42
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.900
That such an ass should owe them.

43
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.230
That they are out by lease.

44
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.070
Here comes the duke.

45
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.370
How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!

46
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.500
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?

47
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.130
Not I.

48
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.770
Nor I.

49
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.630
Saw you my daughter?

50
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.700
Neither.

51
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.630
Why then,

52
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.200
She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;

53
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.600
And Eglamour is in her company.

54
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.800
'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,

55
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.530
As he in penance wander'd through the forest;

56
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.200
Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,

57
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.130
But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;

58
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.800
Besides, she did intend confession

59
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.000
At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;

60
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.800
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.

61
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.730
Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,

62
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.070
But mount you presently and meet with me

63
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.270
Upon the rising of the mountain-foot

64
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.000
That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:

65
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.300
Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.

66
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.800
Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,

67
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.130
That flies her fortune when it follows her.

68
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.800
I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour

69
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.270
Than for the love of reckless Silvia.

70
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.100
And I will follow, more for Silvia's love

71
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.130
Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.

72
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.070
And I will follow, more to cross that love

73
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.970
Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.

74
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.900
(yells and laughing)

75
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.730
Come, come,

76
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.670
Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.

77
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.730
A thousand more mischances than this one

78
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.970
Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.

79
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.330
Come, bring her away.

80
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.570
Where is the gentleman that was with her?

81
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.630
Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,

82
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.470
But Moyses and Valerius follow him.

83
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.300
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;

84
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.230
There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;

85
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.830
The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.

86
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.400
Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:

87
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.930
Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,

88
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.970
And will not use a woman lawlessly.

89
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.630
O Valentine, this I endure for thee!

90
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.530
How use doth breed a habit in a man!

91
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.270
This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,

92
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:13.030
I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:

93
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.000
Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,

94
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.100
And to the nightingale's complaining notes

95
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.230
Tune my distresses and record my woes.

96
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.370
O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,

97
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.030
Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,

98
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.730
Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall

99
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.370
And leave no memory of what it was!

100
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.970
Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;

101
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.930
Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!

102
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.930
What halloing and what stir is this to-day?

103
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.500
These are my mates, that make their wills their law,

104
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.770
Have some unhappy passenger in chase.

105
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.700
They love me well; yet I have much to do

106
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.330
To keep them from uncivil outrages.

107
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.330
Withdraw thee, Valentine:

108
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.000
who's this comes here?

109
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.630
Madam, this service I have done for you,

110
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.570
Though you respect not aught your servant doth,

111
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.200
To hazard life and rescue you from him

112
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.230
That would have forced your honour and your love;

113
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.230
Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;

114
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.000
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg

115
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.800
And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.

116
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.070
How like a dream is this I see and hear!

117
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.930
Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.

118
00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.670
O miserable, unhappy that I am!

119
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.970
Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;

120
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.470
But by my coming I have made you happy.

121
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.300
By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.

122
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.730
And me, when he approacheth to your presence.

123
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.200
Had I been seized by a hungry lion,

124
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.830
I would have been a breakfast to the beast,

125
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:16.200
Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.

126
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.900
O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,

127
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.500
Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!

128
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.870
And full as much, for more there cannot be,

129
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.000
I do detest false perjured Proteus.

130
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.800
Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.

131
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.870
What dangerous action, stood it next to death,

132
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.870
Would I not undergo for one calm look!

133
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.700
O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,

134
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.700
When women cannot love where they're beloved!

135
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.100
When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.

136
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.800
Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,

137
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.700
For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith

138
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.270
Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths

139
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.700
Descended into perjury, to love me.

140
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:05.300
Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;

141
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.600
And that's far worse than none; better have none

142
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.570
Than plural faith which is too much by one:

143
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.700
Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!

144
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.970
In love Who respects friend?

145
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.000
All men but Proteus.

146
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.470
Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words

147
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.830
Can no way change you to a milder form,

148
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.400
I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,

149
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.300
And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.

150
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.130
O heaven!

151
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.000
I'll force thee yield to my desire.

152
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.700
Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,

153
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.230
Thou friend of an ill fashion!

154
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:52.670
Valentine!

155
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:58.730
Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,

156
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:04.230
For such is a friend now; treacherous man!

157
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.570
Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye

158
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.070
Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say

159
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:17.430
I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.

160
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.200
Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand

161
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:26.030
Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,

162
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:30.430
I am sorry I must never trust thee more,

163
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:35.900
But count the world a stranger for thy sake.

164
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:42.730
The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,

165
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:48.300
'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!

166
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:58.000
My shame and guilt confounds me.

167
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.170
Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow

168
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.200
Be a sufficient ransom for offence,

169
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.200
I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer

170
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.300
As e'er I did commit.

171
00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:21.230
Then I am paid;

172
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:30.300
And once again I do receive thee honest.

173
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.800
Who by repentance is not satisfied

174
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.430
Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.

175
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:59.200
By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:

176
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:05.900
And, that my love may appear plain and free,

177
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:11.530
All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.

178
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.970
O me unhappy!

179
00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:18.800
Look to the boy.

180
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.130
Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?

181
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.070
Look up; speak.

182
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.670
O good sir,

183
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.330
my master charged me to deliver a ring to Madam Silvia,

184
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.100
which, out of my neglect, was never done.

185
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.300
Where is that ring, boy?

186
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.600
Here 'tis; this is it.

187
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.730
How! let me see:

188
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.130
Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.

189
00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.300
O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:

190
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.430
This is the ring you sent to Silvia.

191
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.600
But how camest thou by this ring?

192
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.700
At my depart I gave this unto Julia.

193
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:03.100
And Julia herself did give it me;

194
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:12.600
And Julia herself hath brought it hither.

195
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:20.900
How! Julia!

196
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:25.170
Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,

197
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.570
And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.

198
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:40.530
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!

199
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:47.970
O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!

200
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.970
Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me

201
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.200
Such an immodest raiment, if shame live

202
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.200
In a disguise of love:

203
00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.900
It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,

204
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:07.530
Women to change their shapes than men their minds.

205
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:14.030
Than men their minds! O 'tis true.

206
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.900
Were man constant, he were perfect.

207
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.630
That one error Fills him with faults;

208
00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.970
makes him run through all the sins:

209
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:30.570
Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.

210
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:52.430
What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy

211
00:14:52.430 --> 00:15:01.200
More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?

212
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.970
Come, come, a hand from either:

213
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.570
Let me be blest to make this happy close;

214
00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:17.030
'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.

215
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:23.600
Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.

216
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.000
And I mine.

217
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:39.200
A prize, a prize, a prize!

218
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.170
Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke.

219
00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.230
Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,

220
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:47.530
Banished Valentine.

221
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.270
Sir Valentine!

222
00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.670
Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.

223
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.170
Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;

224
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.770
Come not within the measure of my wrath;

225
00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:58.600
Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,

226
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.530
Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;

227
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.200
Take but possession of her with a touch:

228
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.030
I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.

229
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.970
Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;

230
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.370
I hold him but a fool that will endanger

231
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.470
His body for a girl that loves him not:

232
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:15.430
I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.

233
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.030
The more degenerate and base art thou,

234
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.500
To make such means for her as thou hast done

235
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.430
And leave her on such slight conditions.

236
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.830
Now, by the honour of my ancestry,

237
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:32.970
I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,

238
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.200
And think thee worthy of an empress' love:

239
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.770
Know then, I here forget all former griefs,

240
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.730
Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,

241
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.500
Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,

242
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.930
To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,

243
00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:52.570
Thou art a gentleman and well derived;

244
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:57.100
Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.

245
00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:02.000
I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.

246
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.230
I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,

247
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.130
To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.

248
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.500
I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.

249
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.170
These banish'd men that I have kept withal

250
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.070
Are men endued with worthy qualities:

251
00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:13.670
Forgive them what they have committed here

252
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.700
And let them be recall'd from their exile:

253
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.630
They are reformed, civil, full of good

254
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.270
And fit for great employment, worthy lord.

255
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:25.730
Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:

256
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.870
Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.

257
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.600
Come, let us go: we will include all jars

258
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.770
With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.

259
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:41.770
(cheers and music)

260
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.570
And, as we walk along, I dare be bold

261
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:45.630
With our discourse to make your grace to smile.

262
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.470
What think you of this page, my lord?

263
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.900
I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.

264
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.100
I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.

265
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.600
What mean you by that saying?

266
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.270
Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,

267
00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.530
That you will wonder what hath fortuned.

268
00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:04.770
Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear

269
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.230
The story of your loves discovered:

270
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:11.200
That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;

271
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:17.500
One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.

272
00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:20.330
