00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:39.270


2
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.670
From Ireland thus comesYork to claim his right,

3
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.900
And pluck the crown fromfeeble Henry's head:

4
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.270
Ring, bells, aloud; burn,bonfires, clear and bright,

5
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.630
To entertain greatEngland's lawful king.

6
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:06.630
Ah! sancta majestas, whowould not buy thee dear?

7
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.930
Let them obey that knownot how to rule;

8
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.070
This hand was made tohandle naught but gold.

9
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.070
I cannot give due actionto my words,

10
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.300
Except a sword or sceptrebalance it:

11
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.470
A sceptre shall it have,have I a sword,

12
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.600
On which I'll toss theflower-de-luce of France.

13
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.700
Whom have we here?Buckingham, to disturb me?

14
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.900
The king hath sent him,sure: I must dissemble.

15
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.230
York, if thou meanestwell, I greet thee well.

16
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.930
Humphrey of Buckingham, Iaccept thy greeting.

17
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.600
Art thou a messenger, orcome of pleasure?

18
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.270
A messenger from Henry,our dread liege,

19
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.630
To know the reason ofthese arms in peace;

20
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.370
Or why thou, being asubject as I am,

21
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.470
Against thy oath and trueallegiance sworn,

22
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.500
Should raise so great apower without his leave,

23
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.670
Or dare to bring thy forceso near the court.

24
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.100
Scarce can I speak, mycholer is so great:

25
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.570
O, I could hew up rocksand fight with flint,

26
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.900
I am so angry at theseabject terms;

27
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.970
But I must make fairweather yet a while,

28
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.770
Till Henry be more weakand I more strong,--

29
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.570
Buckingham, I prithee,pardon me,

30
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.200
That I have given noanswer all this while;

31
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.170
My mind was troubled withdeep melancholy.

32
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.800
The cause why I havebrought this army hither

33
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.470
Is to remove proudSomerset from the king,

34
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.230
Seditious to his grace andto the state.

35
00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.400
That is too muchpresumption on thy part:

36
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.830
But if thy arms be to noother end,

37
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.400
The king hath yielded untothy demand:

38
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.900
The Duke of Somerset is inthe Tower.

39
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.200
Upon thine honour, is heprisoner?

40
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.400
Upon mine honour, he isprisoner.

41
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.500
Then, Buckingham, I dodismiss my powers.

42
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.530
Soldiers, I thank you all;disperse yourselves;

43
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.030
Meet me to-morrow in St.George's field,

44
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.800
You shall have pay andevery thing you wish.

45
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.200
And let my sovereign,virtuous Henry,

46
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.670
Command my eldest son,nay, all my sons,

47
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.870
As pledges of my fealtyand love;

48
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.230
I'll send them all aswilling as I live:

49
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.600
Lands, goods, horse,armour, any thing I have,

50
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.470
Is his to use, so Somersetmay die.

51
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.270
York, I commend this kindsubmission:

52
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.500
(horns sound)

53
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.670
In all submission andhumility

54
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.470
York doth present himselfunto your highness.

55
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.830
Then what intends theseforces thou dost bring?

56
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.830
To heave the traitorSomerset from hence,

57
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.130
And fight against thatmonstrous rebel Cade,

58
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.330
Who since I heard to bediscomfited.

59
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.900
If one so rude and of somean disposition

60
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.570
May pass into the presenceof a king,

61
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.570
Lo, I present your grace atraitor's head,

62
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.030
The head of Cade, whom Iin combat slew.

63
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.000
The head of Cade! GreatGod, how just art Thou!

64
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.470
O, let me view his visage,being dead,

65
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.070
That living wrought mesuch exceeding trouble.

66
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.570
Tell me, my friend, artthou the man that slew him?

67
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.970
I was, an't like yourmajesty.

68
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.800
How art thou call'd? andwhat is thy degree?

69
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.330
Alexander Iden, that's myname;

70
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.000
A poor esquire of Kent,that loves his king.

71
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.030
So please it you, my lord,'twere not amiss

72
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.130
He were created knight forhis good service.

73
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.770
Iden, kneel down.

74
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.570
Rise up a knight.

75
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.400
We give thee for reward athousand marks,

76
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.200
And will that thouhenceforth attend on us.

77
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.430
May Iden live to meritsuch a bounty.

78
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.670
And never live but trueunto his liege!

79
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.830
See, Buckingham, Somersetcomes with the queen:

80
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.170
Go, bid her hide himquickly from the duke.

81
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.200
For thousand Yorks heshall not hide his head,

82
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.670
But boldly stand and fronthim to his face.

83
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.570
How now! is Somerset atliberty?

84
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.700
Then, York, unloose thylong-imprison'd thoughts,

85
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.830
And let thy tongue beequal with thy heart.

86
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.970
Shall I endure the sightof Somerset?

87
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.430
False king! why hast thoubroken faith with me,

88
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.330
Knowing how hardly I canbrook abuse?

89
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:21.770
King did I call thee? no,thou art not king,

90
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.600
Not fit to govern and rulemultitudes,

91
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.200
Which darest not, no, norcanst not rule a traitor.

92
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.370
That head of thine dothnot become a crown;

93
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.330
Thy hand is made to graspa palmer's staff,

94
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.430
And not to grace an awfulprincely sceptre.

95
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:46.230
That gold must round engirtthese brows of mine,

96
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.770
Whose smile and frown,like to Achilles' spear,

97
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.670
Is able with the change tokill and cure.

98
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.230
Here is a hand to hold asceptre up

99
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.230
And with the same to actcontrolling laws.

100
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.300
Give place: by heaven,thou shalt rule no more

101
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.870
O'er him whom heavencreated for thy ruler.

102
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:14.970
O monstrous traitor! Iarrest thee, York,

103
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.570
Of capital treason 'gainstthe king and crown;

104
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:26.430
Obey, audacious traitor;kneel for grace.

105
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:36.700
Wouldst have me kneel?first let me ask of these,

106
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.600
If they can brook I bow aknee to man.

107
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.970
Sirrah, call in my sons tobe my bail;

108
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.870
I know, ere they will haveme go to ward,

109
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.930
They'll pawn their swordsfor my enfranchisement.

110
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.130
Call hither Clifford! bidhim come amain,

111
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.170
To say if that the bastardboys of York

112
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:03.930
Shall be the surety fortheir traitor father.

113
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:08.470
O blood-besottedNeapolitan,

114
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:15.100
Outcast of Naples,England's bloody scourge!

115
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.000
The sons of York, thybetters in their birth,

116
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.530
Shall be their father'sbail; and bane to those

117
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:26.530
That for my surety willrefuse the boys!

118
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:32.000
See where they come: I'llwarrant they'll make it good.

119
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.630
And here comes Clifford todeny their bail.

120
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.770
Health and all happinessto my lord the king!

121
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:50.770
I thank thee, Clifford:say, what news with thee?

122
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.030
Nay, do not fright us withan angry look;

123
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:59.630
We are thy sovereign,Clifford, kneel again;

124
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.830
For thy mistaking so, wepardon thee.

125
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:08.930
This is my king, York, Ido not mistake;

126
00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:13.500
But thou mistakest me muchto think I do:

127
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.400
To Bedlam with him! is theman grown mad?

128
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.530
Ay, Clifford; a bedlam andambitious humour

129
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.500
Makes him oppose himselfagainst his king.

130
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.570
He is a traitor; let himto the Tower,

131
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.370
And chop away thatfactious pate of his.

132
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.230
He is arrested, but willnot obey;

133
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.170
His sons, he says, shallgive their words for him.

134
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.200
Will you not, sons?

135
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.600
Ay, noble father, if ourwords will serve.

136
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.730
And if words will not,then our weapons shall.

137
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:49.670
Why, what a brood oftraitors have we here!

138
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:54.070
Look in a glass, and callthy image so:

139
00:09:54.070 --> 00:10:00.200
I am thy king, and thou afalse-heart traitor.

140
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.500
Call hither to the stakemy two brave bears,

141
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.300
That with the very shakingof their chains

142
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:14.030
They may astonish thesefell-lurking curs:

143
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.470
Bid Salisbury and Warwickcome to me.

144
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:41.770
Are these thy bears? we'llbait thy bears to death.

145
00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.100
And manacle the bear-wardin their chains,

146
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.070
If thou darest bring themto the baiting place.

147
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.600
Oft have I seen a hoto'erweening cur

148
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.470
Run back and bite, becausehe was withheld;

149
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.900
Who, being suffer'd withthe bear's fell paw,

150
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.600
Hath clapp'd his tailbetween his legs and cried:

151
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.870
And such a piece ofservice will you do,

152
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.430
If you oppose yourselvesto match Lord Warwick.

153
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.200
Hence, heap of wrath, foulindigested lump,

154
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.300
As crooked in thy mannersas thy shape!

155
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:15.730
Nay, we shall heed youthoroughly anon.

156
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:20.830
Take heed, lest by yourheat you burn yourselves.

157
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.730
Why, Warwick, hath thyknee forgot to bow?

158
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.470
Old Salisbury, shame tothy silver hair,

159
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:32.530
Thou mad misleader of thybrain-sick son!

160
00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:36.530
O, where is faith? O,where is loyalty?

161
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.100
If it be banish'd from thefrosty head,

162
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.200
Where shall it find aharbour in the earth?

163
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.170
Wilt thou go dig a graveto find out war,

164
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:48.100
And shame thine honourableage with blood?

165
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.970
Why art thou old, andwant'st experience?

166
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:53.700
Or wherefore dost abuseit, if thou hast it?

167
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.430
For shame! in duty bendthy knee to me

168
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.270
That bows unto the gravewith mickle age.

169
00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.070
My lord, I have consider'dwith myself

170
00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.600
The title of this mostrenowned duke;

171
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.770
And in my conscience dorepute his grace

172
00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.030
The rightful heir toEngland's royal seat.

173
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.200
Hast thou not swornallegiance unto me?

174
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.400
I have.

175
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.900
Canst thou dispense withheaven for such an oath?

176
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.370
It is great sin to swearunto a sin,

177
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:26.770
But greater sin to keep asinful oath.

178
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.600
Who shall be bound by anysolemn vow

179
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.730
To do a murderous deed, torob a man,

180
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.600
To force a spotlessvirgin's chastity,

181
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.700
To reave the orphan of hispatrimony,

182
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.070
To wring the widow fromher custom'd right,

183
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.400
And have no other reasonfor this wrong

184
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.600
But that he was bound by asolemn oath?

185
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:52.730
A subtle traitor needs nosophister.

186
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.230
Call Buckingham, and bidhim arm himself.

187
00:12:54.230 --> 00:13:00.800
Call Buckingham, and allthe friends thou hast,

188
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:07.470
Both thou and they shall cursethis fatal hour.

189
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:12.300
I am resolved for death ordignity.

190
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.400
The first I warrant thee,if dreams prove true.

191
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.200
You were best to go to bedand dream again,

192
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.600
To keep thee from thetempest of the field.

193
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.970
I am resolved to bear agreater storm

194
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.370
Than any thou canstconjure up to-day;

195
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.970
And so to arms, victoriousfather,

196
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.370
To quell the rebels andtheir complices.

197
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:37.630
Fie! charity, for shame!speak not in spite,

198
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.130
For you shall sup withJesu Christ to-night.

199
00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.030
Foul stigmatic, that'smore than thou canst tell.

200
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.270
If not in heaven, you'llsurely sup in hell.

201
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.870
(drums sounding)

202
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:04.730
Clifford of Cumberland,'tis Warwick calls:

203
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.830
And if thou dost not hidethee from the bear,

204
00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:11.170
Now, when the angrytrumpet sounds alarum

205
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:16.130
And dead men's cries dofill the empty air,

206
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:20.370
Clifford, I say, comeforth and fight with me:

207
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:26.430
Proud northern lord,Clifford of Cumberland,

208
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:30.430
Warwick is hoarse withcalling thee to arms.

209
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.430
Of one or both of us thetime is come.

210
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:47.730
Hold, Warwick, seek theeout some other chase,

211
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:51.000
For I myself must huntthis deer to death.

212
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.470
Then, nobly, York; 'tisfor a crown thou fight'st.

213
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.600
As I intend, Clifford, tothrive to-day,

214
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.570
It grieves my soul toleave thee unassail'd.

215
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.430
What seest thou in me,York? why dost thou pause?

216
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.770
With thy brave bearingshould I be in love,

217
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.230
But that thou art so fastmine enemy.

218
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.930
Nor should thy prowesswant praise and esteem,

219
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:25.000
But that 'tis shownignobly and in treason.

220
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.600
So let it help me nowagainst thy sword

221
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.970
As I in justice and trueright express it.

222
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:36.000
My soul and body on theaction both!

223
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.030
A dreadful lay! Addressthee instantly.

224
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:42.830
The end crowns all.

225
00:17:52.630 --> 00:18:01.200
Thus war hath given theepeace, for thou art still.

226
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.700
Peace with his soul,heaven, if it be thy will!

227
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.530
(battle cries)

228
00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:16.770
Shame and confusion! allis on the rout;

229
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.770
Fear frames disorder, anddisorder wounds

230
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:23.930
Where it should guard. Owar, thou son of hell,

231
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.530
Whom angry heavens do maketheir minister

232
00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:29.900
Throw in the frozen bosomsof our part

233
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.800
Hot coals of vengeance!

234
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:41.370
Let no soldier fly. He thatis truly dedicate to war

235
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.330
Hath no self-love, nor hethat loves himself

236
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.570
Hath not essentially butby circumstance

237
00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:51.430
The name of valour.

238
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:02.830
O, let the vile world end,

239
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:04.600
And the premised flames ofthe last day

240
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.300
Knit earth and heaventogether!

241
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.070
Now let the generaltrumpet blow his blast,

242
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.070
Particularities and pettysounds

243
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.730
To cease!

244
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.930
Wast thou ordain'd,dear father,

245
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.800
To lose thy youth inpeace, and to achieve

246
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.800
The silver livery ofadvised age,

247
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.500
And, in thy reverence andthy chair-days, thus

248
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:43.330
To die in ruffian battle?Even at this sight

249
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:48.630
My heart is turn'd tostone: and while 'tis mine,

250
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:54.770
It shall be stony. Yorknot our old men spares;

251
00:19:54.770 --> 00:20:01.300
No more will I theirbabes: tears virginal

252
00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:05.670
Shall be to me even as thedew to fire,

253
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:10.130
And beauty that the tyrantoft reclaims

254
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:15.270
Shall to my flaming wrathbe oil and flax.

255
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:19.830
Henceforth I will not haveto do with pity:

256
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.600
Meet I an infant of thehouse of York,

257
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.130
Into as many gobbets willI cut it

258
00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:28.570
As wild Medea youngAbsyrtus did:

259
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:33.470
In cruelty will I seek outmy fame.

260
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:43.470
Come, thou new ruin of oldClifford's house:

261
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:50.470
As did AEneas old Anchisesbear,

262
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:55.730
So bear I thee upon mymanly shoulders;

263
00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:05.470
But then AEneas bare aliving load,

264
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.630
Nothing so heavy as thesewoes of mine.

265
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.870
So, lie thou there;

266
00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:11.300
For underneath analehouse' paltry sign,

267
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.630
The Castle in SaintAlban's, Somerset

268
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:17.700
Hath made the wizardfamous in his death.

269
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:22.670
Sword, hold thy temper;heart, be wrathful still:

270
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.730
Priests pray for enemies,but princes kill.

271
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:13.970
Away, my lord! you areslow; for shame, away!

272
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:18.530
Can we outrun the heavens?good Margaret, stay.

273
00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:23.130
What are you made of?you'll nor fight nor fly:

274
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:25.870
Now is it manhood, wisdomand defence,

275
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:28.570
To give the enemy way, andto secure us

276
00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:33.200
By what we can, which canno more but fly.

277
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.800
If you be ta'en, we thenshould see the bottom

278
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.600
Of all our fortunes: butif we haply scape,

279
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.370
As well we may, if notthrough your neglect,

280
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.530
We shall to London get,where you are loved

281
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.530
And where this breach nowin our fortunes made

282
00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.170
May readily be stopp'd.

283
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:51.170
But that my heart's onfuture mischief set,

284
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:53.830
I would speak blasphemyere bid you fly:

285
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:56.430
But fly you must;uncurable discomfit

286
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.670
Reigns in the hearts ofall our present parts.

287
00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:01.430
Away, for your relief! andwe will live

288
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.230
To see their day and themour fortune give:

289
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:07.030
Away, my lord, away!

290
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:44.670
Of Salisbury, who canreport of him,

291
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.270
That winter lion, who inrage forgets

292
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:52.130
Aged contusions and allbrush of time,

293
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.400
And, like a gallant in thebrow of youth,

294
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.400
Repairs him with occasion?This happy day

295
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.170
Is not itself, nor have wewon one foot,

296
00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.430
If Salisbury be lost.

297
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:05.500
My noble father,

298
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.000
Three times to-day I holphim to his horse,

299
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.130
Three times bestrid him;thrice I led him off,

300
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.030
Persuaded him from anyfurther act:

301
00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:16.470
But still, where dangerwas, still there I met him;

302
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:19.000
And like rich hangings ina homely house,

303
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.330
So was his will in his oldfeeble body.

304
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.170
(drums sound)

305
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:29.570
But, noble as he is, lookwhere he comes.

306
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:44.830
Now, by my sword, wellhast thou fought to-day;

307
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:52.230
By the mass, so did weall. I thank you, Richard:

308
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:55.800
God knows how long it is Ihave to live;

309
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.970
And it hath pleased himthat three times to-day

310
00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:03.200
You have defended me fromimminent death.

311
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:09.470
Well, lords, we have notgot that which we have:

312
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.200
'Tis not enough our foesare this time fled,

313
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.270
Being opposites of suchrepairing nature.

314
00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:19.500
I know our safety is tofollow them;

315
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.200
For, as I hear, the kingis fled to London,

316
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.500
To call a present court ofparliament.

317
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.870
Let us pursue him ere thewrits go forth.

318
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.670
What says Lord Warwick?shall we after them?

319
00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:39.570
After them! nay, beforethem, if we can.

320
00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:45.430
Now, by my faith, lords,'twas a glorious day:

321
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:50.670
Saint Alban's battle wonby famous York

322
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:55.200
Shall be eternized in allage to come.

323
00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:00.400
Sound drums and trumpets,and to London all:

324
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.030
And more such days asthese to us befall!

325
00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:07.200
(drums sound)

326
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:17.930
