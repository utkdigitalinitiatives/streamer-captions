WEBVTT

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.800
THEY MOVE AS IF OBEYING
A SINGLE COMMAND

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.670
AS A SINGLE
ORGANISM,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.700
BUT THERE IS NOBODY
WHO LEADS THEM.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.930
THEY ARE MANY,
BUT THEY ARE ONE:

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.300
A SWARM.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:48.300


00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.470
TRANSLATOR: THE
MOST FASCINATING THING

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.770
ABOUT SWARMS
IS THEIR BEAUTY.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.600


00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.630
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO
UNDERSTAND A SYSTEM WITHOUT

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.730
ANY HIERARCHY OR CENTRAL
CONTROL BECAUSE ALL OF OUR

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.300
SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS SEEM TO
IMPLY SOME KIND OF HIERARCHY.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.500
TRANSLATOR: HOW DO ANTS
MANAGE TO BUILD A BRIDGE?

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.030
THERE IS NO ORDER TELLING
ANTS TO BUILD A BRIDGE

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.170
OR HOW TO DO IT, BUT
THEY STILL MANAGE IT.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:32.300


00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.900
TRANSLATOR: I'M INTERESTED IN
HOW MASSES BEHAVE GENERALLY

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.070
AND WHETHER THIS CAN
LEAD TO A DESIRABLE RESULT.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.300


00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.000
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT'S MADE SWARM INTELLIGENCE

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.470
OR COLLECTIVE
INTELLIGENCE SEEM MYSTERIOUS

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.870
IS THAT IT CLEARLY
OPERATES IN A DIFFERENT WAY

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.130
FROM THE ORGANIZATIONS
THAT WE'RE USED TO.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.400
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
IT OPERATES BY MAGIC.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.800
IT MEANS THAT IT'S DIFFERENT
AND THAT WE NEED TO

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.400
LEARN TO UNDERSTAND
HOW IT WORKS.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.200


00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.170
SWARMS ARE
DIFFERENT.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.330
THE INDIVIDUALS
ARE SMALL AND WEAK,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.600
BUT AS A WHOLE A SWARM
HAS INCREDIBLE ABILITIES.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.430
SCIENTISTS SPEAK OF
"SWARM INTELLIGENCE".

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.170
IT COMES FROM
THE COLLABORATION

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.170
OF THOUSANDS
OF INDIVIDUALS.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.700
BUT CAN THERE BE INTELLIGENCE
WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS?

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.670
SCIENTISTS ARE TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.670
THE MYSTERIOUS
BEHAVIOR OF SWARMS.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.730
WE COULD LEARN
FROM THEM.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.570
WHAT SEEMS ALIEN AND
DIFFERENT AT FIRST GLANCE

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.970
COULD POSSIBLY
EVEN BE VERY HUMAN.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:03:05.430


00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:12.970
STURNUS VULGARIS -
THE COMMON STARLING.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.200
FOR ROME'S INHABITANTS
AN ANNUAL NUISANCE.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.970


00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.200
GIGANTIC SWARMS OVER WINTER
BETWEEN OCTOBER AND FEBRUARY

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.200
OUTSIDE OF
ROME'S GATES.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.100
AT NIGHT THEY LOOK FOR PLACES
TO ROOST IN THE WARM CITY

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.930
MUCH TO THE CHAGRIN
OF ITS INHABITANTS.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.730
THE DAILY SPECTACLE
ABOVE THE HOLY CITY

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.700
LASTS AROUND
HALF AN HOUR.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.170
THESE SWARMS CONTAIN
UP TO 50,000 INDIVIDUALS.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.570
THEY CREATE FORMATIONS
AND BREAK THEM UP AGAIN

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.230
AS IF LED BY AN
INVISIBLE HAND.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.270
IT'S A SPECTACLE OF
THE HIGHEST PERFECTION

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.930
BUT THERE IS NO
CHOREOGRAPHER.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.270
THE SWARM IS CONSTANTLY
CHANGING ITS SHAPE AND DENSITY,

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.900
BUT STILL IT
STAYS TOGETHER.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.300
THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING ALLOWING

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.470
THIS EXTRAORDINARY
COHESION,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.900
A MECHANISM CAUSING THE
SWARM TO ORGANIZE ITSELF.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.800


00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.430
THERE WERE MANY
THEORIES AND MODELS

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.800
BUT VERY FEW DATA TO
COMPARE MODELS WITH.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.400
SO BASICALLY EVERYONE COULD
COME UP WITH A NEW MODEL

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.870
AND EVERYONE WOULD BE
HAPPY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.470
THERE WAS NO INTEGRAL
DATA TO COMPARE WITH.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.500
SO WE WANTED TO
PROVIDE THE FIRST DATA

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.370
ON LARGE GROUPS OF
ANIMALS IN THREE DIMENSIONS

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.430
TO VALIDATE OR
INVALIDATE THE MODELS.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.270


00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.900
HOW DOES AN INDIVIDUAL
BIRD HAVE TO BEHAVE

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.630
SO THAT THE RESULT IS A
PERFECTLY FUNCTIONING WHOLE,

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.170
A SWARM THAT CAN'T
BE RIPPED APART,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.300
NOT EVEN BY
SEVERE DISRUPTIONS?

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.700
THE PLAN IS TO ANSWER
THIS QUESTION ON A ROOF

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.100
NEAR ROME'S
TERMINI STATION.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.800
HERE PHYSICISTS FROM SAPIENZA
UNIVERSITY WANT TO UNCOVER

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.330
THE SECRET OF THE STARLINGS
WITH A NEW METHOD.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.430
THEY WANT TO PHOTOGRAPH
THE SWARM WITH SEVERAL

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.230
SYNCHRONIZED CAMERAS
FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.400


00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.730
THEY HOPE TO CREATE THE
FIRST THREE-DIMENSIONAL

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.700
IMAGES OF THESE
HUGE STARLING SWARMS.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:55.200


00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.230
USING THESE PHOTOGRAPHS
THE SCIENTISTS WANT TO SOLVE

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.500
A PROBLEM NOBODY HAS
YET BEEN ABLE TO ANSWER.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.700
WHAT DO THE INDIVIDUAL BIRDS IN
THE SWARM USE AS ORIENTATION?

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.770
THEY WANT TO FIND OUT HOW FROM
COUNTLESS INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.400
A SYSTEM IS CREATED
THAT CONTROLS ITSELF

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.670
AND MAKES
COLLECTIVE DECISIONS.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:39.600


00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.630
TRANSLATOR: SWARMS ARE A
PHENOMENA WHERE INDIVIDUALS

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.470
COME TOGETHER IN LARGE
NUMBERS AND WHERE THOSE

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.830
INDIVIDUALS ORIENT
THEMSELVES VERY STRONGLY

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.000
TO THE OTHERS IN
THEIR IMMEDIATE VICINITY.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.470


00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.000
THE PERFECT SYNCHRONIZATION
OF THE MOVEMENTS

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.330
IS AN AESTHETIC
SPECTACLE FOR US,

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.400
BUT FOR THE
MEMBERS OF THE SWARM

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.330
IT'S A MATTER
OF SURVIVAL.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.400
TRANSLATOR: ANIMALS SWARM
FOR DIFFERENT REASONS

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.800
AND ONE OF THE
MOST IMPORTANT IS

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.970
PROTECTION
AGAINST PREDATORS.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.030
THE RISK OF GETTING EATEN
BY A PREDATOR IS REDUCED

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.630
THE GREATER THE
SIZE OF THE SWARM.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.500
ANOTHER ADVANTAGE CAN BE WHEN
SEARCHING FOR FOOD BECAUSE

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.130
INDIVIDUALS GET INFORMATION
FROM OTHERS IN THE SWARM.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:43.630


00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.530
THE SWARM STAYS
TOGETHER WITHOUT ANYONE

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.270
ORCHESTRATING THE MOVEMENTS
OF THE INDIVIDUALS IN IT.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.400
IT FORMS A UNIT THAT IS GREATER
THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:08:00.170
BUT THE SWARM ALSO HAS
TO "ACT" ALL THE TIME.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.500
IT HAS TO REACT TO NEW
SITUATIONS AND MAKE DECISIONS

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.270
SUCH AS WHETHER TO
MOVE LEFT OR RIGHT.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.500
UNLIKE PACKS, SWARMS
HAVE NO LEAD ANIMAL

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.500
THAT ALL THE
OTHERS FOLLOW.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.370
ALL INDIVIDUALS
ARE EQUAL.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.500
BUT HOW DO SWARMS
MAKE DECISIONS

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.170
IF NOBODY IS
IN CHARGE?

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.200
THIS IS THE QUESTION THAT HAS
BEEN OCCUPYING BEHAVIORAL

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.970
SCIENTIST JENS KRAUSE
IN LEEDS FOR A LONG TIME.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.730
TRANSLATOR: THE SWARM
ORGANIZES ITSELF AND CAN

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.970
MAKE A DECISION ABOUT
THE DIRECTION COLLECTIVELY.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.000
THERE DON'T HAVE
TO BE LEADERS

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.970
TO MAKE THESE
DECISIONS FOR THE SWARM.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.300
THE SWARM ORGANIZES
ITSELF AND CAN AS A RESULT

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.570
MAKE DECISIONS
ABOUT DIRECTION.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:47.630
BUT HOW ARE THESE
DECISIONS ACTUALLY MADE?

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:53.230
BECAUSE IF YOU WATCH
A SWARM IT LOOKS AS IF

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.570
THEY ALL MOVE AT THE
SAME TIME, AS IF IT WEREN'T

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.170
THE PRODUCT OF MANY
INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.330
TO UNDERSTAND THIS
DECISION MAKING PROCESS

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.270
IS ABSOLUTELY
FASCINATING TO US.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:13.500


00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.670
EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN THE
SWARM MAKES A DECISION.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:21.500
NO SINGLE ANIMAL HAS THE
OVERVIEW OF THE WHOLE.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.570
THE DECISIONS OF
THE INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.030
PRODUCE THE BEHAVIOR
OF THE ENTIRE SWARM

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:33.070
AND THIS BEHAVIOR CAN BE
VITAL FOR THE INDIVIDUALS.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.200
WHEN A
PREDATOR ATTACKS

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.570
A MEMBER OF A SWARM HAS
A MUCH HIGHER CHANCE

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.870
OF SURVIVAL THAN AN
ISOLATED INDIVIDUAL.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.500


00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.470
ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS
FOR US WAS TO FIND HOW

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.230
THEY CAN STICK TOGETHER
IN SUCH LARGE GROUPS WHEN

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.170
THEY'RE HEAVILY PERTURBED
BY A FALCON, FOR EXAMPLE.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.330
SO STAYING TOGETHER
FOR THEM IS CRUCIAL.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:01.070
BUT THEY HAVE
TO ACHIEVE THIS

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.630
IN THE FACE OF VERY
BIG PERTURBATION.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.000
LIKE A CHANGE IN
DENSITY, SHAPE, AND SO ON.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.400
SO WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND,
WHAT KIND OF INTERACTION

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.030
BETWEEN THE BIRDS, WHAT
KIND OF COMMUNICATION

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.730
BETWEEN THE BIRDS COULD
GIVE RISE TO THIS INCREDIBLE

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.730
CAPABILITY OF STAYING
TOGETHER OF THE GROUP?

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.700


00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.970
ANDREA CAVAGNA AND
HIS TEAM HAVE MANAGED

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.370
FOR THE FIRST TIME TO
DEPICT A SWARM OF SEVERAL

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.000
THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN A
THREE DIMENSIONAL IMAGE.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.530


00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.100
THE SCIENTISTS ARE
AMAZED BY WHAT THEY FIND.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.400
THE BIRDS BEHAVE
COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.230
FROM WHAT HAD
BEEN ASSUMED TO DATE.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.730
BEFORE OUR RESULTS THERE WERE
MANY MODELS AND THEORIES.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:56.130
AND ALL MODELS ASSUMED
THAT BIRDS INTERACTED

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.130
IN A PURELY
MATRIC WAY.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.300
THIS MEANS THAT EACH
BIRD IS INTERACTING

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.800
WITH ALL BIRDS WITHIN
A GIVEN FIXED RADIUS.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.970
AND THIS CAN BE ONE METER,
TWO METERS, WHATEVER.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:16.700
IF THIS IS TRUE, THEN YOU SEE
THAT IN A HIGH DENSITY SITUATION

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:21.030
YOU'RE ALSO INTERACTING WITH
A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:27.630
WHERE HERE PERHAPS YOU
HAVE JUST ONE INDIVIDUAL

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:32.900
INTERACTING
WITH YOU.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.800
SO THIS IS NOT VERY GOOD TO
KEEP COHESION BECAUSE WHAT

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.530
THE FLOCKS ARE DOING ALL THE
TIME IS TO CHANGE THEIR DENSITY

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.630
LIKE BALLOONS WHICH INFLATE
AND DEFLATE CONTINUOUSLY.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.230
SO WHAT WE
DISCOVERED IS THAT

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.470
THEY DO NOT
INTERACT IN THIS WAY.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:52.170
SO WHAT THEY DO INSTEAD IS
THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL KEEPS

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.830
UNDER CONTROL A FIXED NUMBER
OF INDIVIDUALS OF NEIGHBORS,

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.570
IRRESPECTIVE OF
WHERE THEY ARE.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:07.870
WE FIND THEY INTERACT WITH SIX,
SEVEN NEIGHBORS, SO IN THIS CASE

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:13.500
THIS INDIVIDUAL HERE IS
INTERACTING WITH THESE SIX GUYS,

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:20.930
AND THEN IN THIS CASE IT IS
INTERACTING WITH THESE GUYS

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:26.570
IRRESPECTIVE OF WHERE THEY
ARE AND HOW DISTANT THEY ARE.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.970
SO IN THE LOW DENSITY FLOCK
THEY WILL BE PRETTY FAR AWAY.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.970
IN THE HIGH DENSITY FLOCK
THEY WILL BE FAIRLY CLOSE.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:38.730
WHERE IN THIS CASE
THEY'RE RATHER DISTANT

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.530
BECAUSE OF THE DENSITY,
AND SO YOU SEE

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.900
IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
FROM A MATRIC WAY OF INTERACT.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:49.900
SO IT ISN'T THE DISTANCE THAT IS
CRUCIAL FOR A SWARM'S COHESION.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.630
IT'S THE NUMBER OF NEIGHBORS
WITH WHICH A BIRD COMMUNICATES.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.300
THE SIMPLE BEHAVIOR
OF THE INDIVIDUALS

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.730
RESULTS IN THE COMPLEX
BEHAVIOR OF THE SWARM.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:07.030
THIS ALLOWS SWARMS TO ADAPT
TO EVER CHANGING SITUATIONS

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:10.930
AND ALSO TO SOLVE COMPLICATED
ORGANIZATIONAL PROBLEMS

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:15.230
SUCH AS THOSE OF THE RED
HARVESTER ANT IN ARIZONA.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:24.070
THEY ARE NOT EVEN A CENTIMETER
IN LENGTH AND THEY ARE BLIND.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.070
BUT THERE ARE
MANY OF THEM.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.370
A SINGLE COLONY OF
RED HARVESTER ANTS

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.700
NUMBERS TEN TO TWELVE
THOUSAND WORKERS.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.270
IT TAKES A SECOND GLANCE
TO RECOGNIZE THEIR NESTS,

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:44.900
FLATTENED MOUNDS PROTRUDING
GENTLY OVER THE DESERT FLOOR.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:54.500
RED HARVESTER ANTS
MAINLY EAT PLANT SEEDS.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.800
BUT ONLY SOME OF THE ANTS' WORK
IS RELATED TO GATHERING FOOD.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.470
THERE ARE MANY OTHER TASKS
THAT NEED DOING IN A COLONY.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.330
SOME KEEP THE
NEST IN ORDER.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.570
OTHERS TAKE CARE
OF THE YOUNG.

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.470
AND YET OTHERS
REMOVE RUBBISH.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.200
ALL OF THESE ACTIVITIES
HAVE TO BE COORDINATED

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.700
TO ALLOW THE
COLLECTIVE TO SURVIVE.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.370
NO INDIVIDUAL ANT
HAS THE OVERVIEW

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.400
OVER THE CONDITION
OF THE ENTIRE COLONY.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.270
NOT EVEN
THE QUEEN.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.770
WHEN HUMANS SET OUT TO
DO SOMETHING COLLECTIVELY,

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.370
EVERY PERSON
HAS SOME IDEA

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.830
OF WHAT THE GOAL IS
OF THE WHOLE GROUP.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.630
AND WHAT'S AMAZING ABOUT THE
WAY THAT AN ANT COLONY WORKS,

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.130
THERE'S NO ANT IN THERE THAT
SAYS "WE NEED MORE FOOD,

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.500
WE NEED TO
WORK HARDER".

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.230
EACH INDIVIDUAL, EACH
COMPONENT USES ONLY

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.470
LOCAL INFORMATION AND
MAKES VERY LOCAL DECISIONS

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.630
AND IN THE AGGREGATE
THE WHOLE SYSTEM WORKS.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.300
BUT NO PARTICIPANT
IN THE SYSTEM

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.870
UNDERSTANDS WHAT
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:15:00.870


00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.970
THE COMPLEX DIVISION OF LABOR
OF THE RED HARVESTER ANTS

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:07.070
IS A MYSTERY DEBORAH GORDON
HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.370
FOR DECADES.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.430
TOGETHER WITH UNDERGRADUATE
AND DOCTORAL STUDENTS

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.200
SHE LEAVES HER LABORATORY
IN STANFORD UNIVERSITY

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.170
EVERY SUMMER TO SET UP
CAMP IN SOUTHERN ARIZONA.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.900
HERE, CLOSE TO THE MEXICAN
BORDER, SHE IS RESEARCHING HOW

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.570
COLONIES OF RED HARVESTER ANTS
ORGANIZE THEIR LIVES AND WORK.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.070
UNLIKE THE MYTH OF
THE EVER BUSY ANT,

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:38.100
THE ANT COLONY IS NOT
EQUALLY ACTIVE EVERY DAY.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.770
A COLONY LIKE ANY
ORGANISM HAS TO RESPOND

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.300
TO A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT.
THINGS HAPPEN.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.000
ONE DAY THERE'S MORE FOOD,
ONE DAY THERE'S A STORM

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.330
AND THE NEST HAS
TO BE REPAIRED.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.670
AND SOMEHOW THE
COLONY HAS TO CHANGE

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.530
THE NUMBERS OF ANTS
WORKING ON EACH TASK

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.670
IN A WAY THAT'S APPROPRIATE
FOR THE CURRENT SITUATION.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.630
AND THE QUESTION I ASK
ABOUT HARVESTER ANTS IS

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.830
HOW DOES THE
COLONY DO IT?

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:15.900


00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.670
IF NOBODY IS SAYING, OKAY,
WE NEED MORE OVER THERE

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.470
FIXING THE NEST OR WE NEED MORE
OVER THERE COLLECTING FOOD,

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.800
AND YET SOMEHOW THE
COLONY DOES ADJUST

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.800
ITS EFFORT TO DIFFERENT
TASKS; SO MY QUESTION IS

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.600
HOW DO THEY DO IT WITHOUT
ANY CENTRAL CONTROL?

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.000


00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.270
NOBODY TELLS THE ANT
COLONY WHAT TO DO,

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.970
BUT IT STILL ACTS AS A
COORDINATED SYSTEM.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.070
IT IS THE COLLECTIVE
THAT DECIDES.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:49.930


00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.600
BUT HOW ARE DECISIONS
MADE THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.600
ALL OF THE MEMBERS
OF THE GROUP?

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.170
DOES IT MATTER HOW
LARGE THE GROUP IS?

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:01.270
IN ORDER TO FIND THAT OUT, JENS
KRAUSE BROUGHT IN ASSISTANTS.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.600
TRANSLATOR: WE DEVELOPED
THE ROBO-FISH IN ORDER

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.300
TO HAVE TOTAL CONTROL
OVER ONE FISH IN A SWARM.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.270
THIS HAS ALWAYS
BEEN MY DREAM.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.230
I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA
WHEN I WAS 18 OR 19.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.930
YOU CAN SEE HOW A
SWARM MAKES DECISIONS,

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:19.430
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH
FISH INITIATED THIS DECISION.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:24.000
BUT WITH THE ROBOFISH WE HAVE
A WAY OF CREATING A DECISION.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
WE CAN DECIDE WHEN A
FISH TURNS LEFT OR RIGHT.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.700
AND WE CAN THEN SEE HOW
THE REST OF THE SWARM

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.870
REACTS TO
THIS DECISION.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:40.000
THIS GIVES US A VERY CONTROLLED
SITUATION IN THE AQUARIUM.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.730


00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.030
THE ROBOFISH IS CONTROLLED
THROUGH A MAGNET

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.870
UNDER THE
AQUARIUM.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.230
THE REAL STICKLEBACKS ARE
SUSPICIOUS OF THE STRANGER

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.900
AT FIRST, BUT THEN THEY ACCEPT
IT AS A MEMBER OF THE SWARM

00:17:54.900 --> 00:18:00.400
DESPITE ITS
STRANGE BEHAVIOR.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.730
TRANSLATOR: THE ROBOFISH
MOVES THE WAY WE TELL IT TO.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:07.400
A NORMAL LIVING FISH WOULD
MAKE A DIRECTIONAL DECISION,

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.230
AND IF OTHERS
DIDN'T FOLLOW SUIT

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.830
IT WOULD QUICKLY RETURN
TO THE SWARM AND ADAPT.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.470
BUT THE ROBOFISH
DOESN'T ADAPT.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.670
THAT'S AN UNFAMILIAR
SITUATION FOR THE OTHER FISH.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.300
MEMBERS OF THE SWARM
DON'T USUALLY MAKE

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.330
SUCH EXTREME
DECISIONS.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.330
THEY TEND TO THEN FOLLOW
THIS INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.130
THEY ASSUME IT MUST HAVE
VERY CLEAR INFORMATION

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.200
WHICH IT IS ACTING
ON AT THAT MOMENT.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:37.700
AND THIS HAS A VERY STRONG
INFLUENCE ON THE OTHERS.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.130
THE RESEARCHERS WANT
TO CONDUCT AN EXPERIMENT

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:45.700
TO FIND OUT HOW INDIVIDUAL
DECISIONS BECOME COLLECTIVE.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.230
THE EXPERIMENT INVOLVES
A SWARM MAKING DECISIONS.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:54.530
IT HAS TO CHOOSE THE BEST OPTION
WHEN PRESENTED WITH SEVERAL.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:57.930
TO STOP IT FROM BEING TOO EASY,
THE ROBOFISH IS MADE TO INCITE

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.800
THE OTHERS TO A BEHAVIOR THEY
WOULDN'T NORMALLY PURSUE.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:08.700
IT IS ATTEMPTING TO LEAD
THEM AWAY FROM THE WORMS.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.330
AT FIRST THE TEST
SWARM IS TOO SMALL.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:17.300
ONLY TWO FISH ARE IN THE
AQUARIUM WITH THE ROBOFISH.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.800
THE ROBOFISH EASILY
MANAGES TO MOVE THE SWARM

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.670
AWAY FROM THE
FOOD SOURCE.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:33.830
THE SWARM HAS ALLOWED ITSELF TO
MAKE AN UNFAVORABLE DECISION.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.970
THE EXPERIMENT IS GOING
INTO THE SECOND ROUND.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:42.770
NOW IT IS ONE
AGAINST TEN.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:46.000
THE ROBOFISH WILL BEHAVE
IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
AS IN THE FIRST
EXPERIMENT.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.330
THE QUESTION IS
WHETHER A LARGER SWARM

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.770
IS JUST AS EASILY
MANIPULATED AS A SMALL ONE.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:20:05.670


00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:09.270
THE LARGER SWARM ALSO FOLLOWS
THE ROBOFISH TO THE FOOD,

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.900
BUT IT CAN'T GET
THEM TO MOVE AWAY.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.770
THE SWARM HAS OVERRIDDEN
THE DECISION OF THE ROBOFISH

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:19.170
AND MADE A DIFFERENT,
MORE INTELLIGENT CHOICE.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.000
TRANSLATOR: IN A SITUATION
WHERE A LEADER FISH

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.530
MAKES A BAD DECISION, THE
SWARM WILL NOT NECESSARILY

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.170
FOLLOW IT UNLESS THIS
DECISION IS SUPPORTED

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:30.730
BY ONE OR TWO OTHER
FISH WHICH MAKES IT

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.130
MORE CONVINCING FOR
THE REST OF THE SWARM.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.770
WE TALK ABOUT
THRESHOLD VALUES.

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.330
A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF
THE SWARM HAS TO PERFORM

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.100
THE BEHAVIOR FOR
THE REST TO FOLLOW.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.070
ONE INDIVIDUAL
ISN'T ALWAYS ENOUGH.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:48.870
THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE
INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE BAD

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:53.130
DECISIONS AND THIS PRINCIPLE OF
SOCIAL RANKING PREVENTS THAT,

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:56.970
WHICH IS A FORM OF
SWARM INTELLIGENCE.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.870


00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:03.570
SWARMS BEHAVE MORE
INTELLIGENTLY THAN INDIVIDUALS.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.270
THEIR ABILITY TO SOLVE
PROBLEMS AND MAKE DECISIONS

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:10.500
CAN BE CLASSED
AS INTELLIGENCE.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:15.830
IT'S AN INTELLIGENCE INDIVIDUAL
CREATURES DON'T HAVE.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.630
THIS INTELLIGENCE IS
CREATED AS A RESULT OF

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:22.300
THE COORDINATED BEHAVIOR
OF THE INDIVIDUALS.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.370
THIS SWARM INTELLIGENCE
MUST ALSO BE WHAT ALLOWS

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:28.300
THE ANT COLONY TO
ADAPT ITS ACTIVITIES

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.870
TO THE DAY'S REQUIREMENTS
AND TO DECIDE WHETHER

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:34.030
IT IS A GOOD DAY
FOR FORAGING OR NOT.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.730
BEFORE THE FORAGERS OF
THE COLONY BECOME ACTIVE,

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.600
PATROLLERS EXPLORE
THE TERRAIN FOR FOOD.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.670
IT IS ONLY WHEN
THEY COME BACK

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.800
THAT THE OTHERS
START BRINGING IT IN.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.900
MOST ANTS CAN'T SEE.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.470
THEY OPERATE
MOSTLY BY SMELL.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.400
AND ANTS ARE COATED
WITH A LAYER OF GREASE

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.830
THAT CARRIES THE
COLONY'S SPECIFIC ODOR.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:57.800
AND THAT'S HOW ANY ANT
OR BEE OR WASP KNOWS

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.230
WHEN IT MEETS ANOTHER
ANT IF IT'S A NEST MATE.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.530
BECAUSE EACH NEST HAS ITS
OWN CHARACTERISTIC ODOR.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.930
AND THEN WE FOUND THAT,
IN HARVESTER ANTS AT LEAST,

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.000
EACH TASK HAS
ITS OWN ODOR.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.030
SO AN ANT THAT SPENDS A LOT OF
TIME OUTSIDE, LIKE A FORAGER,

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:20.230
ENDS UP SMELLING DIFFERENT
FROM AN ANT IN THE NEST.

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.470
A FORAGER RECOGNIZES
A RETURNING PATROLLER

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.000
BY HER SCENT.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.200
BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO
CAUSE HER TO LEAVE THE COLONY

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.830
BECAUSE THE COLONY
FIRST HAS TO CALCULATE

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:36.400
WHETHER IT IS SAFE ENOUGH
TO DEPLOY FORAGERS.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.200
WORKING IN THE DESERT
IS PERILOUS, AFTER ALL.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.900
WHAT TELLS THESE ANTS
WHEN THE RIGHT TIME

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.100
TO GATHER
FOOD HAS COME?

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:52.470


00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:57.030
TO FIND THAT OUT, THE
SCIENTISTS USE THE SCENTS

00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:03.970
OF DIFFERENT
WORKERS.

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:08.900
THE SCENTS ARE APPLIED TO
SMALL BEADS THE SIZE OF ANTS.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.570
THEY ARE FAKE ANTS DESIGNED
TO TRICK THE REAL ONES.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:21.000


00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.770
GORDON AND HER COLLEAGUES
WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:29.700
MECHANISM THE COLONY USES TO
ORGANIZE ITS SEARCH FOR FOOD.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:37.400


00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.500
AS EXPECTED, ONLY THE BEADS
WITH THE PATROLLER'S SCENT

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:45.400
STIMULATE THE WAITING FORAGERS
TO BEGIN SEARCHING FOR FOOD.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.430
BUT IT TAKES ANOTHER MORE
SOPHISTICATED MECHANISM

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:52.000
TO EXPLAIN WHY ON SOME DAYS
THOUSANDS, BUT ON OTHERS

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.530
ONLY A FEW DOZEN OR NO
FORAGERS SET OFF TO WORK.

00:23:55.530 --> 00:24:00.400
WE FOUND THAT FORAGERS WAIT
FOR PATROLLERS TO COME BACK

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.100
BEFORE THEY GO
OUT TO FORAGE.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.470
AND THE FORAGERS WON'T GO
OUT UNTIL THEY MEET A PATROLLER

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.630
AT A RATE OF ABOUT
ONE PER TEN SECONDS.

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.900
SO WE TRIED DROPPING IN THE
BEADS TOO FAST AND TOO SLOW,

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.970
AND IT HAS TO BE AT AN
INTERVAL OF ABOUT TEN SECONDS

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.600
AND THAT MUST BE
HOW LONG AN ANT

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.830
CAN REMEMBER WHAT
HAPPENED TO IT.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.900


00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.700
IF AN ANT MEETS ANOTHER,
SAY, EVERY 45 SECONDS

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.070
OR EVERY 60 SECONDS, IT'S
AS IF IT NEVER HAPPENED.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:32.000
IT'S FORGOTTEN THAT IT
EVER MET THE OTHER ANT.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.530
ONLY WHEN SUFFICIENT
PATROLLERS RETURN SAFELY

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:37.100
TO THE NEST DO THE
FORAGERS SET TO WORK.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.370
THAT'S HOW, UNLIKE
AN INDIVIDUAL ANT,

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.430
THE COLONY
KNOWS WHETHER

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:45.370
IT'S A GOOD DAY TO
SEARCH FOR FOOD.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:50.000
THE MORE I STUDY ANTS
THE LESS I THINK IS GOING ON

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.030
IN THE MIND
OF AN ANT.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.670
SO THE SYSTEM HAS BECOME
VERY FAMILIAR TO ME,

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:57.470
BUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
BE AN ANT SEEMS MORE

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:00.470
AND MORE DIFFERENT FROM
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:17.200


00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.830
SIMPLE UNITS THAT, AS A GROUP,
FORM AN INTELLIGENT WHOLE.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:24.300
IT'S AN INTELLIGENCE THAT ISN'T
CONTROLLED BY A CENTRAL BRAIN

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.570
BUT BY AN ACTING
TOGETHER OF MANY

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:34.030
NON INTELLIGENT
INDIVIDUALS.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:39.500
THE SWARM'S RECIPE FOR
SUCCESS FASCINATES BIOLOGISTS.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.600
BUT IN RECENT YEARS IT HAS
ALSO CAPTURED THE ATTENTION

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.630
OF ENGINEERS
AND CYBERNETICISTS.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.130
THEIR IDEA IS TO APPLY
SWARM BEHAVIOR TO MACHINES.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:58.930
THIS IS THE BIRTH
OF ROBOT SWARMS.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:02.400
TRANSLATOR: THE SCIENCE
OF ROBOTICS IS INTERESTED

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.130
IN SWARM INTELLIGENCE
BECAUSE IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:09.130
TO CONTROL MANY ROBOTS
WITHOUT CENTRAL COMMAND.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:16.570


00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:21.270
IN THE 80'S MANY ENGINEERS
ASKED THEMSELVES

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.970
HOW TO CONSTRUCT ROBOTS
THAT WOULD ALSO FUNCTION

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:27.330
RELIABLY IN A CONSTANTLY
CHANGING ENVIRONMENT.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.300
THE TRADITIONAL
METHODS IN ROBOTICS

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:33.630
PROVED UNSUCCESSFUL
IN THIS REGARD.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:37.870
THE ROBOTS WERE EXTREMELY
SUSCEPTIBLE TO PROBLEMS

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:41.830
AND HARDLY ABLE TO
REACT IN REAL TIME.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:46.900


00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:52.270
THAT'S WHY IN THE 90'S
PEOPLE STARTED TO GO DOWN

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:55.770
A COMPLETELY NEW
ROUTE IN ROBOTICS.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:27:02.600
INSTEAD OF BUILDING A SINGLE,
MORE COMPLICATED ROBOT

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.300
THE IDEA WAS BORN TO
BUILD ROBOT SWARMS

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.670
CONSISTING OF INDIVIDUALS
WITH A VERY SIMPLE BEHAVIOR

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:13.600
BUT WITH THE ABILITY TO
SOLVE PROBLEMS TOGETHER.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:37.530


00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.800
THE BIOLOGIST, GUY
THERAULAZ, IS RESEARCHING

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.370
HOW INSECT SWARMS
SOLVE COMPLEX PROBLEMS

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.830
AND HOW THE STRATEGIES
USED BY ANTS

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:51.100
CAN BE APPLIED TO
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.870
TRANSLATOR: THE BEHAVIOR
OF ANTS IS VERY SIMPLE.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.130
THEY ARE
LIVING MACHINES.

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:58.530
OF COURSE THEY'RE
VERY COMPLEX MACHINES,

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:02.230
BUT THEIR BEHAVIOR
IS VERY SIMPLE.

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:06.270
EVERY ANT ONLY
HAS A REPERTOIRE

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:12.630
OF AROUND 20 DIFFERENT
BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS.

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:16.170
THERE IS ONE SIMPLE BUT
INGENIOUS ANT STRATEGY

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.570
THAT HAS INSPIRED
ROBOT DESIGNERS

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:20.530
MORE THAN
ANY OTHER:

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:24.030
THE METHOD DIFFERENT ANTS
USE TO EXPLOIT A FOOD SOURCE

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.500
AS EFFICIENTLY
AS POSSIBLE.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.300
THIS EXPERIMENT
SHOWS HOW IT WORKS.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.130
A COLONY OF BLACK GARDEN
ANTS IS SUPPOSED TO CHOOSE

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.670
IN FAVOR OF THE
SHORTER OF TWO ROUTES

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:36.830
BETWEEN THE NEST
AND THE FOOD SOURCE.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.970
WHICH ROUTE THE ANTS PICK
FIRST IS COMPLETELY RANDOM.

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:47.100
NO INDIVIDUAL CAN ESTIMATE
OR EVEN MEASURE ITS LENGTH.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.970
AT FIRST IT LOOKS CHAOTIC
BUT AFTER JUST A FEW MINUTES

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.430
SOMETHING
INCREDIBLE HAPPENS.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:55.700
THE COLONY
DECIDES COLLECTIVELY

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.130
TO OPT FOR THE SHORTER
OF THE TWO ROUTES.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:04.070
THIS IS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH
A SPECIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:08.430
TRANSLATOR: ANTS, AS
INSECTS, CAN TAKE IN COMPLEX

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.830
CHEMICAL INFORMATION
KNOWN AS PHEROMONES.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:17.470
THIS GIVES THEM ACCESS TO SIGNS
WE, AS HUMANS, CAN'T READ.

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:22.970


00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.800
ANTS GIVE OFF
PHEROMONES,

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.030
SCENTS THAT
EVAPORATE WITH TIME.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:29.100
THEY FOLLOW
A SIMPLE RULE.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.200
WHEN IN DOUBT
THEY TAKE THE ROUTE

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.530
THAT HAS MORE
PHEROMONES.

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:38.500
THIS RULE TRIGGERS A SIMPLE
BUT INGENIOUS MECHANISM.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.600
ANTS THAT JUST HAPPEN TO
TAKE THE SHORTER ROUTE FIRST

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.200
RETURN FASTER.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.530
THE SHORTER ROUTE GETS A HIGHER
PHEROMONE CONCENTRATION

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:51.000
SO MORE AND MORE ANTS SETTING
OFF CHOOSE THE SHORTER ROUTE.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.700


00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.970
TRANSLATOR: THIS
IS A REAL EXAMPLE

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:00.900
OF COLLECTIVE
INTELLIGENCE.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.170
BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL
ANTS AREN'T INCAPABLE

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.470
OF MEASURING THE
LENGTH OF THE ROUTE.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:10.270
THEY CAN ONLY DO THIS TOGETHER,
SO IT'S A COLLECTIVE PHENOMENON.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:25.870


00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:28.830
LIKE THE ANTS, THE MINI
ROBOTS ARE RATHER HELPLESS

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:30.500
AS INDIVIDUALS.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.800
THEY ONLY POSSESS
A FEW SENSORS

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.930
AND A FEW
BASIC BEHAVIORS.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.630
LIKE THE ANTS, THE ROBOT
SWARM HAS TO FIND

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:43.930
THE SHORTEST LINE
BETWEEN TWO POINTS.

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:47.530
FIRST THE ROBOTS SEARCH
THE NETWORK RANDOMLY.

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:49.670
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE GOAL IS.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:52.030
LIKE THE ANTS, THEY ARE
PROGRAMMED TO FOLLOW

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.470
THE LIGHT TRACES
OF THEIR COLLEAGUES.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:57.030
THE BRIGHTER THE TRAIL
THE GREATER THE PROBABILITY

00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:01.670
THAT A ROBOT
WILL FOLLOW IT.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:06.530
THE ROBOTS RECOGNIZE
WHEN THEY ARE IN THE START,

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.000
OR DESTINATION, ZONE.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.970
IT'S ONLY NOW THAT
THEY THEMSELVES

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:13.430
BEGIN TO
RELEASE MESSAGES.

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:16.400
OVER TIME, THE LIGHT TRAIL
BETWEEN THE START AND GOAL

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.970
BECOMES STRONGER AND
THE OTHER TRAILS FADE.

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:21.870
AFTER AROUND
20 MINUTES

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.770
ALL OF THE ROBOTS ARE
ON THE SHORTEST ROUTE.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:30.530
THE ANT'S STRATEGY
HAS WORKED HERE TOO.

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:34.830
ROBOT SWARMS ARE
STILL IN THEIR INFANCY

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:38.870
BUT GREAT
TASKS AWAIT THEM.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.570
TRANSLATOR: THERE HAS
BEEN MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:45.100
POSSIBLE FUTURE APPLICATIONS
FOR ROBOT SWARMS.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.830
ONE OF THEM IS THE EXPLORATION
OF HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:49.770
SUCH AS
OTHER PLANETS.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:54.270
ANOTHER AREA INVOLVES NANO
ROBOTS INJECTED INTO THE BODY.

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.670
IN SUCH SYSTEMS INDIVIDUAL
COMPONENTS WOULD BE TINY

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:01.070
AND, AS A RESULT, SO SIMPLE
THAT INDIVIDUAL ROBOTS

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:06.130
COULDN'T BE
CONTROLLED.

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:10.500
THE ONLY WAY TO CONTROL
SUCH SYSTEMS WOULD BE

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:16.770
TO USE THE INTERACTION
BETWEEN THE ROBOTS.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:23.300


00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.700
THE FUTURE BELONGS
TO ROBOT SWARMS.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.870
AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF STUTTGART

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:30.330
RESEARCHERS ARE
GOING ONE STEP FURTHER.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:33.830
FROM SWARMS
TO ORGANISMS.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:36.730
TRANSLATOR: THE VISION IS TO
CREATE THE SELF-ORGANIZATION

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:39.430
OF INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS
WITHOUT EXPLICITLY

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:42.900
PROGRAMMING THIS
SELF-ORGANIZATION.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:47.830


00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:56.330
IMAGINE A MEMBER OF A SWARM IS
ACTUALLY A CELL IN AN ORGANISM.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:04.670
THEN YOU CAN IMAGINE A ROBOT
SWARM COMING TOGETHER...

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:08.570
AS A DOG MAYBE.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:15.330
THIS DOG WILL BE ABLE
TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:21.100
FAR BETTER THAN
AN INDIVIDUAL CELL.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.830


00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:26.900
THE SWARM HAS TO ADAPT
TO ITS ENVIRONMENT.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:31.800
IT HAS TO DEVELOP
TO SURVIVE.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:36.630
TRANSLATOR: IMAGINE
OUR SWARM IS RELEASED

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:40.270
ON INHOSPITABLE
TERRAIN.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:48.070
SAY I DEPLOY 100 SWARM ROBOTS
IN RUGGED TERRAIN WHERE THEY

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:52.900
COULD ONLY SURVIVE IF THEY
CAME TOGETHER AS A SINGLE BODY

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.370
- BY FORMING A
SNAKE, FOR EXAMPLE.

00:33:56.370 --> 00:34:03.470
AS A SNAKE THEY
COULD THEN SURVIVE.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:07.870
THE ARTIFICIAL ORGANISMS
OF THE FUTURE WILL PROGRAM

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:11.100
THEMSELVES AND SHARE THEIR
ENERGY AND INFORMATION

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:16.370
INDEPENDENTLY AND
WITHOUT HUMAN CONTROL.

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:19.230
THE AIM IS TO HAVE THE
ROBOT ORGANISMS ADAPT

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:22.470
SPONTANEOUSLY TO NEW TASKS
WITHOUT IT BEING NECESSARY

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:27.500
FOR THEIR DEVELOPERS
TO PROGRAM THEM FIRST.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.670
TRANSLATOR: THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT EVOLUTION HAS DONE.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:34.170
IT WASN'T ALL
CONTROLLED FROM ABOVE.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:38.000


00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.570
A MACHINE EVOLUTION
IN FAST FORWARD.

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:42.800
HOW THIS COULD WORK
IN THE FUTURE IS BEING

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.700
RESEARCHED HERE BY
USING SMALL SWARM ROBOTS,

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:50.070
THE PREDECESSORS OF
THE FUTURE ROBOT CELLS.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:52.770
WHAT IS HAPPENING
HERE IS ROBOT SEX.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:55.800
STRATEGIES ARE BEING TESTED
WITH WHICH THE ROBOTS

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.500
CAN PASS ON THEIR
GENETIC INFORMATION.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.800
THE POPULATION THAT IS
BETTER ADAPTED DOMINATES,

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.130
AS IN NATURAL
EVOLUTION.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.300
FOR COMPUTER SCIENTIST
PAUL LEVY THIS IS ALSO

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.730
A FURTHER DEVELOPMENT
OF INTELLIGENCE.

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:14.500
TRANSLATOR: IT IS POSSIBLE
TO IMAGINE THAT A SWARM

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.130
WHICH IS CAPABLE OF
TAKING CARE OF ITSELF

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:20.200
WILL AUTOMATICALLY
SEEK OUT NEW TASKS,

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.470
AND THAT THE SAME SWARM
CAN SOLVE FURTHER PROBLEMS

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:26.430
BY LOOKING FOR NEW,
BETTER TERRITORIES

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:29.170
WHERE IT CAN
SUPPORT ITSELF BETTER.

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:34.370


00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:40.270
THAT'S CONCEIVABLE AND THAT'S
AN INCREASE IN INTELLIGENCE.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:44.930


00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:48.570
INTELLIGENT ROBOT SWARMS THAT
DON'T NEED HUMAN SUPERVISION

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:51.030
ARE STILL A VISION
OF THE FUTURE.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:56.830
BUT IT IS ALSO ONE THAT
TROUBLES MANY PEOPLE.

00:35:56.830 --> 00:36:00.200
WHAT ABOUT
HUMANS?

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.530
TO WHAT EXTENT
DOES OUR BEHAVIOR

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:07.070
DIFFER FROM
THAT OF SWARMS?

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:11.030
WE ACT AS
INDIVIDUALS.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:14.270
WE DECIDE RATIONALLY,
INDEPENDENTLY,

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:16.270
AND OF OUR
OWN FREE WILL.

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:19.730
THAT'S WHAT WE
THINK ANYWAY.

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:26.070
BUT DO WE REALLY ACT AS
INDIVIDUALLY AS WE ALWAYS THINK,

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:32.100
OR DO WE TOO, UNBEKNOWNST
TO US, FOLLOW SWARM LOGIC?

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:36.770


00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:40.370
TRANSLATOR: I BECAME INTERESTED
IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:44.300
PROCESSES IN SOCIETY COULD BE
UNDERSTOOD USING CONCEPTS

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:48.270
FROM COMPLEX SYSTEMS
FROM THE WORLD OF PHYSICS.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:51.130
THESE SYSTEMS CONSIST OF
MANY COMPONENTS, SUCH AS

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:54.970
GAS OR LIQUID PARTICLES THAT
INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER.

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:58.900
IN PHYSICS YOU OFTEN FIND
STRUCTURE-FORMING PHENOMENA

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.200
SUCH AS WAVES
OR TURBULENCE,

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.800
AND THE SAME THING CAN
BE OBSERVED IN SOCIETY.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:10.370


00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:13.700
PHYSICIST DIRK HELBING HAS
BEEN RESEARCHING THE DYNAMICS

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.470
OF PEDESTRIAN MASSES
SINCE THE 1990'S.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:21.000
FOR THE UNTRAINED EYE THIS
IS JUST CHAOTIC DISORDER.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.900


00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.230
TRANSLATOR: IT IS
VERY INTERESTING.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:32.170
WHEN YOU LOOK AT RECORDINGS
OF PEDESTRIAN MASSES

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:35.030
IN FAST FORWARD, ACCELERATED
TEN TIMES FOR EXAMPLE,

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:37.100
YOU CAN SEE
THAT THE CHAOS

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.670
ISN'T AS GREAT AS
YOU INITIALLY IMAGINED.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:45.500
BECAUSE THEN THE BRAIN BECOMES
CAPABLE OF RECOGNIZING PATTERNS.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.770


00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:51.500
IN DENSE CROWDS, MOVEMENT
PATTERNS, STRUCTURES FORM,

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.900
THAT WE AS INDIVIDUALS
ARE NOT AWARE OF.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:59.500
NOBODY CONTROLS
THESE PATTERNS.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.330
THEY FORM BY THEMSELVES
AS THE RESULT OF

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:07.030
COUNTLESS
INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS.

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:10.900
THEY ARE STRUCTURES BY WHICH
CROWDS REGULATE THEMSELVES

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:15.030
WITHOUT INDIVIDUALS
TAKING DELIBERATE ACTION.

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:19.400
TRANSLATOR: MANY SELF
ORGANIZATION PHENOMENA

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.130
THAT FORM IN
PEDESTRIAN CROWDS

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:25.100
ACTUALLY OPTIMIZE THE
FLOW OF PEDESTRIANS.

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.530
LOCAL ENCOUNTERS
BETWEEN PEDESTRIANS

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:31.100
LEAD TO EVASIVE MANEUVERS
AND ALL OF THEM PUT TOGETHER

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.800
PRODUCE AN
INTELLIGENT RESULT

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:40.700
WHERE THE DIFFERENT MOVEMENT
DIRECTIONS ARE SEPARATED.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:45.470


00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:49.430
OUR BEHAVIOR IS CONTROLLED
BY COLLECTIVE DYNAMICS.

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:53.030
INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT USUALLY
AWARE OF THESE DYNAMICS.

00:38:53.030 --> 00:39:00.970


00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:03.400
BUT THE RESULT OF
SELF-ORGANIZATION

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.830
ISN'T ALWAYS
INTELLIGENT.

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:08.830
TRAFFIC JAMS ARE ALSO THE
RESULT OF SUCH PROCESSES.

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:12.800
AS ARE MASS PANICS.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.100
IN 2006 A DISASTER OCCURRED
AMONGST MUSLIM PILGRIMS

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:20.000
IN MECCA, CAUSING
ALMOST 400 DEATHS.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.870
EDDY-LIKE PATTERNS FORMED
STRUCTURES WITH A HUGE FORCE.

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:28.730
INDIVIDUALS WERE
COMPLETELY AT THEIR MERCY.

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:32.200


00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:36.300
TRANSLATOR: SELF
ORGANIZATION PROCESSES

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.800
CAN ALSO PRODUCE
UNFAVORABLE RESULTS.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:43.970
MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:47.800
UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS
THIS PRINCIPLE WORKS

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:53.670
AND UNDER WHAT
CONDITIONS IT DOESN'T WORK.

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:58.000
WHAT CAUSES
UNDESIRABLE RESULTS?

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.870


00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:05.930
THE CALCULATION OF
SELF-ORGANIZATION PATTERNS

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:08.470
IN CROWDS
COULD HELP AVOID

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:13.470
SUCH UNCONTROLLABLE
SITUATIONS IN THE FUTURE.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:16.870
HUMANS PHYSICALLY
DEMONSTRATE THE PROCESSES

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:20.830
THAT RESEMBLE THOSE OF
SWARMS IN CERTAIN CONDITIONS.

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:24.570
BUT DO WE ALSO DEMONSTRATE
SWARM BEHAVIOR IN OUR THOUGHTS?

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:29.400
IS THERE REALLY SUCH A THING
AS THE "WISDOM OF THE MANY?"

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:33.000
ONE EXPERIMENT IN ZURICH IS
EXAMINING FOR THE FIRST TIME

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.930
WHETHER PEOPLES' DECISIONS CAN
BE CONTROLLED BY COLLECTIVE

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:40.500
DYNAMICS AND WHETHER THEY
REALLY ARE SMARTER TOGETHER.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:44.000
TWENTY TEST SUBJECTS HAVE
BEEN ASKED TO GIVE AN ESTIMATE.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.270
THE CLOSER IT IS TO
THE ACTUAL FIGURE

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:49.100
THE HIGHER THE
WINNINGS AT THE END.

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:55.500
FIRST ALL THE PARTICIPANTS HAVE
TO GIVE THEIR OWN ESTIMATE.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.730
BUT THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED
TO THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS.

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:02.470
AFTER EVERY ROUND THE TEST
SUBJECTS CAN SEE ON THE SCREEN

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:06.530
WHAT VALUES
THE OTHERS GAVE.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:10.530
IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THE
AVERAGE OF ALL THE ESTIMATES

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:13.130
IS BETTER THAN THE
INDIVIDUAL ESTIMATES,

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:15.700
THERE REALLY WOULD
BE SUCH A THING

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.470
AS A "WISDOM
OF THE MANY".

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:20.630
IF THE PRINCIPLE OF
COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE

00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:22.800
WERE TO WORK IN HUMANS
IT COULD BE APPLIED

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.630
IN USEFUL WAYS IN
BUSINESS AND SOCIETY,

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:27.800
BUT THE RESULT OF
THE EXPERIMENT

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:31.730
IS LESS CLEAR
THAN EXPECTED.

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:34.900
TRANSLATOR: WE FOUND
OUT IN OUR EXPERIMENT

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:38.730
THAT THERE IS A COLLECTIVE,
OR SWARM, BEHAVIOR.

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:42.270
THE QUESTION IS, IS
THE BEHAVIOR FAVORABLE?

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:45.070
DO WE GET A "WISDOM
OF THE MANY"?

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:47.570
OUR RESULT
IS DEFLATING.

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:50.530
SOMETIMES THE GROUP IDENTIFIES
THE CORRECT SOLUTION,

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:53.300
BUT SOMETIMES
IT IS WAY OFF.

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:57.570


00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:00.400
SO WE SHOULD
BE CAREFUL ABOUT

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:06.800
RELYING ON A
WISDOM OF THE MANY.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:10.470


00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:13.930
WHETHER THE COLLECTIVE IS REALLY
WISER THAN THE INDIVIDUAL

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:16.470
IS SOMETHING NOBODY CAN
YET ANSWER WITH CERTAINTY.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:18.800
BUT WHAT IS CERTAIN
IS THAT HUMAN BEINGS

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.330
ALSO BEHAVE LIKE A SWARM
WHEN MAKING DECISIONS.

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:26.500
NOT ALWAYS, BUT MORE
OFTEN THAN WE THINK.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.970
WE HAVE BEEN LED BY THE NOTION
THAT INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:35.870
HAS TO BE CONTROLLED BY AN
INTELLIGENT CONSCIOUSNESS.

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:38.900
BUT STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS
ON THE PART OF SWARMS

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:42.000
SHOW THAT THAT'S
NOT THE ONLY WAY.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
IT'S A KIND OF INTELLIGENCE
THAT SEEMS STRANGE

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.970
AND ALIEN AT
FIRST GLANCE.

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:53.700
BUT IN TRUTH IT'S CLOSER
TO US THAN WE THINK.

00:42:53.700 --> 00:43:03.470
WE CAN LEARN A LOT FROM IT
AND WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN.

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:06.470
