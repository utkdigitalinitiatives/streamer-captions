00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.250
- [Voiceover] During the
Ice Age, mankind's nutrition

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.959
relied heavily on animal
meat and wild fruits.

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.291
But as the dry and cold
temperature eventually

00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:48.959
depleted their resources,
early man had to search

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:52.208
for food alternatives, and
that was when the early men

00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:55.000
of the Fertile Crescent
discovered that
they could not only

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.250
eat grass, they could also
grow it on a regular basis,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.999
thus giving birth to
Western agriculture.

00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:07.667
Wheat is the earliest known
crop to be cultivated.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:09.999
It went through centuries
of cross-breeding

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:13.291
before producing the
variety commonly used today.

00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:16.333
Scientists believe that this
cross-breeding commenced

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:20.375
in Turkey around 12,000 years
ago, when a grass called

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:23.999
"einkorn" cross-bred with
a wild goatgrass known

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:28.792
by the scientific name
"Aegilops speltoides,"

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:30.875
resulting in the
primitive wheat variety

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:35.583
called "emmer," or
"Triticum dicoccoides."

00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:42.291
Emmer spread to the
Mediterranean region
of the Middle East,

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:44.625
and later on, to
different countries,

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:49.208
like Greece, Cyprus,
and India in 6,500 BC,

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:55.333
to Egypt in 6,000 BC, to
Germany and Spain in 5,000 BC,

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:59.125
to England and
Scandinavia in 3,000 BC,

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:03.500
and to China in 2,000 BC.

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:07.333
After some time, emmer
cross-bred with another

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:13.166
goatgrass with the scientific
name, "Aegilops squarrosa,"

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.999
producing the
variety durum wheat,

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.875
which is widely used
today to make pasta.

00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:21.999
Durum re-crossed with some
of its parent species,

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.792
which gave birth to a
variety with bigger ears

00:02:24.792 --> 00:02:30.709
and easy to remove husks,
the modern or common wheat.

00:02:32.583 --> 00:02:35.625
Common wheat, or Triticum
aestivum, is the third

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:39.583
most important crop today,
following maize and rice.

00:02:39.583 --> 00:02:42.999
Also known as bread wheat,
early known cultivation of this

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:49.000
variety took place in Greek
Macedonia around 1,350 BC.

00:02:49.417 --> 00:02:53.208
It then crossed the
ocean to Mexico in 1520,

00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:58.166
and to early English
colonies in the 1600s.

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:04.083
Common wheat can be
classified in three ways.

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:08.750
One, winter or spring.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.500
Depending on geographical
location, it can be

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.291
sown either as a winter
or a spring crop.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.999
Two, red or white.

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:24.125
Its bran color can indicate
strength and flavor,

00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:28.999
red having more robust
flavor than white.

00:03:30.083 --> 00:03:32.709
And third, as soft or hard.

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.542
Hard common wheat has more
gluten, which makes it

00:03:35.542 --> 00:03:39.500
perfect for breads, while
soft common wheat has lesser

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.041
gluten, which accounts
for a lighter texture

00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:47.250
perfect for cakes, cookies,
and other pastries.

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:52.917
Many consider common wheat
to be the most adaptable

00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:56.375
of all the cereals, having
agronomic characteristics

00:03:56.375 --> 00:03:59.875
suitable in a broader
range of soil conditions,

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:03.834
temperature, and precipitation.

00:04:03.834 --> 00:04:07.083
Common wheat can grow
anywhere between the latitudes

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:09.999
30 and 60 degrees
north of the equator,

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:13.917
and between 27 and 40
degrees south of the equator.

00:04:13.917 --> 00:04:16.999
It can tolerate temperatures
ranging from three degrees

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:21.917
Celsius to 32 degrees
Celsius, and thrives well

00:04:21.917 --> 00:04:25.500
even at 4,500 meters
above sea level.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.999
Most common wheat can tolerate
375 to 875 millimeters

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:35.000
of annual rainfall, but
it can still grow in areas

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.500
with a minimum rainfall
of 250 millimeters,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.166
and a maximum rainfall
of 1,750 millimeters.

00:04:48.291 --> 00:04:51.999
It's undeniable how wheat
contributed to the development

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:55.250
of agriculture, and by
extension, to the evolution

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.875
of mankind from nomad
creatures wandering the wild

00:04:58.875 --> 00:05:04.999
to sociable human
beings building
communities and empires.

00:05:15.083 --> 00:05:19.709
Maize, rice, and wheat are
the top three most important

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:22.542
and widely-produced
food crops in the world.

00:05:22.542 --> 00:05:24.458
That's why their
nutritional values

00:05:24.458 --> 00:05:28.417
and health benefits
are often compared.

00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:31.333
Maize and rice have
their nutritional merits,

00:05:31.333 --> 00:05:34.417
but a quick look at common
wheat's basic nutrient,

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:37.417
mineral, and vitamin
profile will show that

00:05:37.417 --> 00:05:42.083
it can outshine maize
and rice in general.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:45.333
Common wheat has the
highest protein content

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:48.125
among the three with 12.9 grams,

00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:54.000
followed by maize with
9.4, and rice with 7.1.

00:05:54.083 --> 00:05:58.166
It also leads in fiber
content with 12.2 grams,

00:05:58.166 --> 00:06:03.417
compared to maize's
7.3, and rice's 1.3.

00:06:03.417 --> 00:06:07.125
Fiber from whole wheat promotes
a healthy digestive system

00:06:07.125 --> 00:06:12.999
by softening stools and
making waste excretion easier.

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:16.500
Health professionals prefer
that people suffering

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.999
from constipation increase
their fiber intake

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:23.500
instead of taking laxatives.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.999
The daily fiber requirement
of adult males and females

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:31.917
is 38 grams and 25
grams respectively.

00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:34.291
One cup of whole wheat
can already provide

00:06:34.291 --> 00:06:37.625
half of these
fiber requirements.

00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:40.999
Wheat bran, which contains
most of its fiber, is being

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:44.542
studied and linked to the
prevention of breast cancer.

00:06:44.542 --> 00:06:47.999
Scientists believe that
elevated levels of estrogen

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:50.709
are a contributing
factor in the formation

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:53.458
of cancer cells in women.

00:06:53.458 --> 00:06:56.999
Wheat bran can act as an
anti-carcinogenic agent

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:00.083
by enhancing the
metabolic rate of estrogen

00:07:00.083 --> 00:07:03.291
and keeping it at
healthy levels.

00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:06.208
With the exception of magnesium,
in which common wheat's

00:07:06.208 --> 00:07:11.667
126 milligrams is
outperformed by maize's 127,

00:07:11.667 --> 00:07:14.625
common what also
surpasses both crops

00:07:14.625 --> 00:07:18.083
in basic mineral composition.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.417
It has 29 milligrams of calcium,

00:07:24.417 --> 00:07:26.792
3.19 milligrams of iron,

00:07:26.792 --> 00:07:29.999
288 milligrams of phosphorus,

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:33.583
363 milligrams of potassium,

00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:36.709
2.65 milligrams of zinc,

00:07:36.709 --> 00:07:39.667
3.99 milligrams of manganese,

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:45.166
and an impressive 70.7
milligrams of selenium.

00:07:46.875 --> 00:07:50.999
Its vitamin content is as
good as maize and rice.

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:54.999
It has 5.46
milligrams of niacin,

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:57.125
38 micrograms of folate,

00:07:57.125 --> 00:07:59.999
1.01 milligrams of vitamin E,

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:04.000
and 1.9 micrograms
of vitamin K1.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.583
Many medical studies are
now associating B vitamins

00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:10.500
and vitamin E in maintaining
healthy cognitive

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.208
function and overall
mental condition.

00:08:14.208 --> 00:08:17.000
The brain uses a lot
of oxygen to perform,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.500
and vitamin E's antioxidant
properties can protect

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.041
its membranes during
the oxidation process,

00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:26.250
thereby slowing,
if not stopping,

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.917
cognitive decline and
neuron degeneration.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.999
Vitamin E's ability to combat
free radical cells and repair

00:08:34.999 --> 00:08:39.083
damaged cells also protects
the body against harmful

00:08:39.083 --> 00:08:42.000
environmental factors
such as cigarette smoke,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.999
air pollution, and high
exposure to ultraviolet rays.

00:08:48.875 --> 00:08:51.999
The niacin in common wheat
also reduces the risk

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:57.291
of atherosclerosis, or the
hardening of the arteries.

00:08:57.291 --> 00:08:59.667
It helps by producing
histamine, which is

00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:02.750
capable of dilating blood
vessels, and thereby

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.917
promoting efficient
blood circulation.

00:09:07.999 --> 00:09:11.750
Selenium in common wheat
is extraordinarily high,

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.417
which women, especially
pregnant and breastfeeding

00:09:14.417 --> 00:09:17.166
mothers, can take
advantage of to meet their

00:09:17.166 --> 00:09:22.166
daily requirement of
55 to 70 micrograms.

00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:26.208
There are also studies
showing that supplementing

00:09:26.208 --> 00:09:29.875
pregnant women with selenium
can limit their chances

00:09:29.875 --> 00:09:33.792
of developing
postpartum depression.

00:09:33.792 --> 00:09:35.999
Like other grains,
refining common wheat

00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:38.999
strips a lot of its nutrients,
so make sure that you

00:09:38.999 --> 00:09:44.834
get food or use flour that is
made from 100% whole wheat.

00:09:45.667 --> 00:09:49.333
Studies show that three servings
of whole grains per day,

00:09:49.333 --> 00:09:51.917
wheat or other
grains like quinoa,

00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:55.041
can reduce the risk
of heart disease,

00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:59.917
type two diabetes, obesity,

00:10:00.999 --> 00:10:05.125
colon and
hormone-related cancers.

00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:21.709
It is undeniable that
ancient wheat had multiple

00:10:21.709 --> 00:10:24.834
enormous impacts on
history, from the advent

00:10:24.834 --> 00:10:27.875
of agriculture, to the
rise of the empires,

00:10:27.875 --> 00:10:32.500
and the invention of
bread as we know it today.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.166
The cultivation of common
wheat resulted in the invention

00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:38.792
and development of
agriculture during the early

00:10:38.792 --> 00:10:43.375
civilization, ending mankind's
wandering and initiating

00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:45.875
the establishment of
small communities,

00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:49.999
which later on expanded
into becoming great empires,

00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:54.834
such as the Babylonian
and Assyrian empires.

00:10:54.834 --> 00:10:57.750
Common wheat also paved
the way for the development

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:02.667
of leavened bread, due to
its high gluten content.

00:11:02.667 --> 00:11:05.375
As more and more people
preferred leavened bread

00:11:05.375 --> 00:11:07.875
made from wheat,
enhancements were integrated

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:12.375
in cultivation, production,
and bread-making.

00:11:12.667 --> 00:11:16.166
Wind and water mills were
built near wheat fields,

00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:18.083
crop rotation was introduced,

00:11:18.083 --> 00:11:21.834
sieving was done to produce
finer flour, and improved

00:11:21.834 --> 00:11:27.291
ovens were created, such
as the beehive and the pot.

00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:30.583
Another noteworthy impact
of wheat in history

00:11:30.583 --> 00:11:33.750
is how it transformed
bread-making into a real

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.999
business and trade,
thereby promoting bakers

00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:40.583
from being slaves to free men.

00:11:41.917 --> 00:11:44.959
Common wheat also had
a great economic impact

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:48.625
in the United States
during World War II.

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:51.709
There was an increased demand
for food, including wheat,

00:11:51.709 --> 00:11:55.375
to supply armies fighting in
Europe, and authorities saw it

00:11:55.375 --> 00:11:58.542
as an opportunity to generate
income and improve lives

00:11:58.542 --> 00:12:04.291
of farmers by selling
commodities at
affordable prices.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.750
Farmers, particularly
of the Great Plains,

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:12.208
had to increase production
of dairy products, eggs,

00:12:12.208 --> 00:12:17.709
butter, cotton, and
of course, wheat.

00:12:17.959 --> 00:12:20.959
By 1941, the majority
of wheat flour

00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:24.834
was sold and
consumed by the Army.

00:12:24.834 --> 00:12:27.417
Like in Roman times when
bakers were important men

00:12:27.417 --> 00:12:31.041
in society, farmers too
were highly respected during

00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:35.333
the war for their hard
work on the fields.

00:12:42.542 --> 00:12:47.208
In the Netherlands, there's
a town called Stavoren.

00:12:47.208 --> 00:12:50.500
During the Middle Ages,
Stavoren was one of the finest

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.125
harbors in Europe, until
a sandbank formed outside

00:12:54.125 --> 00:12:57.500
the harbor, blocking any
ship from docking and doing

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:03.041
business in town, eventually
resulting in its downfall.

00:13:03.291 --> 00:13:06.417
According to a Dutch
folktale, a rich woman called

00:13:06.417 --> 00:13:09.709
Lady Stavoren ordered a sea
captain to find the most

00:13:09.709 --> 00:13:13.834
precious thing in the
world as a wedding gift.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.583
When the sea captain
returned with tons of wheat,

00:13:17.583 --> 00:13:19.709
the Lady Stavoren
ordered that every

00:13:19.709 --> 00:13:22.166
grain of it be
thrown in the water.

00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:24.625
Heartbroken, the sea
captain left town,

00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:28.166
never to be seen again, and
in the days that passed,

00:13:28.166 --> 00:13:30.917
the discarded grains
sprouted and grew

00:13:30.917 --> 00:13:33.500
and prevented the sands
from drifting away,

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.542
resulting in the
formation of a sandbank.

00:13:37.542 --> 00:13:39.875
Another famous legend
involving wheat

00:13:39.875 --> 00:13:42.542
is the legend of wheat
and the chessboard.

00:13:42.542 --> 00:13:45.999
There are many versions of
this story, but the most famous

00:13:45.999 --> 00:13:49.250
is the one where a prince
challenged a wise man

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:52.750
in a game of chess and lost.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.959
For his prize, the wise man
asked the prince to give him

00:13:55.959 --> 00:13:59.375
grains of wheat for every
square on the chess board,

00:13:59.375 --> 00:14:01.875
each square containing
twice the amount

00:14:01.875 --> 00:14:04.208
of wheat of the previous square.

00:14:04.208 --> 00:14:08.709
At first, the prince
happily obliged,

00:14:08.709 --> 00:14:12.083
but later on he realized
it was impossible for him

00:14:12.083 --> 00:14:15.458
to fulfill his word,
because by the 20th square,

00:14:15.458 --> 00:14:21.417
he needed to give the
wise man 1,480,575 grains,

00:14:21.959 --> 00:14:24.625
and by the time they
reached the 64th square,

00:14:24.625 --> 00:14:27.542
he should have given the
wise man enough grains

00:14:27.542 --> 00:14:31.709
to cover the entire
earth in wheat.

00:14:32.417 --> 00:14:35.291
It's a legend for most
people, but mathematicians

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:37.917
call it a mathematical
problem in the form

00:14:37.917 --> 00:14:41.417
of a word problem, and it
is a very instructive way

00:14:41.417 --> 00:14:46.917
to explain and grasp the
concept of exponential growth.

00:14:49.125 --> 00:14:52.375
It can be said that wheat
helped change the world,

00:14:52.375 --> 00:14:56.792
and as an important grain
today, as it was centuries ago,

00:14:56.792 --> 00:15:00.166
it is exciting to think
of what it can still do

00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:04.500
to shape a better
future for mankind.

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:20.208
Wheat is one of the first
cultivated grains in the world,

00:15:20.208 --> 00:15:23.041
and when it was introduced,
either by force or natural

00:15:23.041 --> 00:15:27.250
assimilation in
other civilizations,
it easily overthrew

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.458
other grains as a
staple crop, like quinoa

00:15:30.458 --> 00:15:34.250
and amaranth in South America.

00:15:34.625 --> 00:15:37.709
But people eventually accepted
wheat for its inherent

00:15:37.709 --> 00:15:41.000
wonders, and today, it's
the third most important

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.709
crop in the world,
behind maize and rice.

00:15:44.709 --> 00:15:49.125
The top five producers of common
wheat in the year 2012 were

00:15:49.125 --> 00:15:53.999
China, with 120,580,000
metric tons,

00:15:53.999 --> 00:15:58.959
India, with 94,880,000
metric tons,

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:04.999
the United States, with
61,755,240 metric tons,

00:16:06.166 --> 00:16:10.959
France, with
40,300,800 metric tons,

00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:16.709
and Russia, with
37,719,640 metric tons.

00:16:17.667 --> 00:16:20.792
Australia, Canada,
Pakistan, Germany,

00:16:20.792 --> 00:16:24.333
and Turkey round off the top 10.

00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:28.166
The primary use of
common wheat is flour.

00:16:28.166 --> 00:16:30.583
It typically comes
in three kinds.

00:16:30.583 --> 00:16:33.999
Wholemeal flour, which
is made from 100% wheat,

00:16:33.999 --> 00:16:38.166
brown flour, which contains
about 85% of the whole grain

00:16:38.166 --> 00:16:40.125
because some of its
bran and wheat germ

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:43.458
have already been
processed, and white flour,

00:16:43.458 --> 00:16:45.999
which has lost most of
its bran and wheat germ

00:16:45.999 --> 00:16:50.999
during milling, leaving
only 75% of the whole grain.

00:16:50.999 --> 00:16:53.999
Common wheat grain
also has non-food uses,

00:16:53.999 --> 00:16:56.208
such as in biofuel production.

00:16:56.208 --> 00:16:59.417
Along with maize, it is
being utilized in worldwide

00:16:59.417 --> 00:17:01.999
efforts to create
alternative sources

00:17:01.999 --> 00:17:04.333
of renewable energy,
like ethanol.

00:17:04.333 --> 00:17:08.125
Since ethanol requires
carbohydrates from
plants to convert

00:17:08.125 --> 00:17:11.709
into sugar, which is then
fermented and distilled,

00:17:11.709 --> 00:17:14.083
common wheat is an ideal
plant for this purpose

00:17:14.083 --> 00:17:18.917
because of its 71 grams of
carbohydrates per 100 grams.

00:17:18.917 --> 00:17:21.709
Wheat required to make
ethanol must come from

00:17:21.709 --> 00:17:25.583
high-yielding and
low-protein varieties.

00:17:25.583 --> 00:17:29.458
Discarded parts of wheat, those
not intended for consumption

00:17:29.458 --> 00:17:34.750
like the straw, are also
used in synthesizing ethanol.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.417
Many countries are already
investing in biofuel

00:17:38.417 --> 00:17:41.000
manufacturing, like
the United Kingdom,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.542
which now has three
biofuel plants,

00:17:43.542 --> 00:17:46.208
wherein wheat is a
major biofuel crop.

00:17:46.208 --> 00:17:49.166
Not many people know
that the gluten extracted

00:17:49.166 --> 00:17:51.999
from common wheat is also
used by pharmaceutical

00:17:51.999 --> 00:17:55.458
companies to make capsules,
as well as by paper

00:17:55.458 --> 00:17:59.875
manufacturers to coat
and make paper stronger.

00:17:59.875 --> 00:18:02.542
Another interesting use
of wheat is substituting

00:18:02.542 --> 00:18:05.999
plastic with wheat starch
to make eco-friendly

00:18:05.999 --> 00:18:09.999
utensils like forks and knives.

00:18:10.333 --> 00:18:12.709
After harvest,
wheat straw usually

00:18:12.709 --> 00:18:14.458
ends up as fodder for livestock.

00:18:14.458 --> 00:18:19.999
However, these discarded parts
have found a new purpose.

00:18:20.125 --> 00:18:23.500
Wheat straw papers.

00:18:23.583 --> 00:18:26.875
Several clean energy
companies have developed paper

00:18:26.875 --> 00:18:30.250
made from a mixture of
wood pulp and wheat straw.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.999
This innovation is considered
to bring positive effects

00:18:33.999 --> 00:18:37.375
by giving farmers additional
income from waste products,

00:18:37.375 --> 00:18:40.999
and contributing to
the preservation of
forests by providing

00:18:40.999 --> 00:18:46.500
an alternative source of paper
fiber other than wood pulp.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.375
For example, straw from wheat
harvested in Canada alone

00:18:50.375 --> 00:18:52.999
can produce eight
million tons of pulp

00:18:52.999 --> 00:18:55.834
that can be used to make
paper, saving almost

00:18:55.834 --> 00:19:00.417
100 million trees a
year in the process.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.959
Authorities have estimated
that food production

00:19:03.959 --> 00:19:08.000
will increase by 60%
in 2050, and in order

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.999
to make wheat a sustainable
crop to feed 9 billion people

00:19:11.999 --> 00:19:15.125
by that time, some believe
the way to make wheat

00:19:15.125 --> 00:19:19.375
a sustainable crop is
through genetic enhancement.

00:19:19.375 --> 00:19:21.875
Agencies from different
countries are partnering

00:19:21.875 --> 00:19:25.500
to develop new and
climate-resilient
wheat varieties

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.500
that can aid food
security in the future.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.291
In 2013, Australia and
India, with support from

00:19:32.291 --> 00:19:35.999
the United States, started a
research project to develop

00:19:35.999 --> 00:19:40.917
new climate-resilient
varieties of wheat and rice.

00:19:40.917 --> 00:19:44.417
Scientists are hoping that
these varieties will sustain

00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:47.999
food production in countries
in South Asia, Africa,

00:19:47.999 --> 00:19:51.250
the Middle East, and North
America that are vulnerable

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.999
to drought due to climate
change and global warming.

00:19:54.999 --> 00:19:58.458
Wheat and mankind have
been partners all along

00:19:58.458 --> 00:20:00.999
in achieving breakthroughs
and innovations,

00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:03.999
and it seems like that
alliance is destined

00:20:03.999 --> 00:20:07.542
to endure in the years to come.

00:20:14.792 --> 00:20:17.999
Wheat attained prominence
in history as flour,

00:20:17.999 --> 00:20:22.667
having reinvented
bread across cultures.

00:20:22.917 --> 00:20:27.083
These are different ways
to cook wheat berries.

00:20:27.834 --> 00:20:30.125
To cook wheat berries
the conventional way,

00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:33.999
rinse one cup of berries
and soak them overnight.

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:36.583
Rinse again before
putting them in a pot

00:20:36.583 --> 00:20:39.000
with two and a
half cups of water.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.125
Bring to a boil, and let simmer

00:20:41.125 --> 00:20:44.667
for one to one and a half hours.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.667
Now to cook it
using a rice cooker.

00:20:47.667 --> 00:20:49.999
Just follow the same
procedure, and use

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:52.375
the same berries to water ratio.

00:20:52.375 --> 00:20:53.999
Cooking wheat berries this way

00:20:53.999 --> 00:20:56.999
will only take 45
minutes to one hour.

00:20:56.999 --> 00:20:59.542
Let it sit and steam
cook for another

00:20:59.542 --> 00:21:01.999
five minutes before serving.

00:21:01.999 --> 00:21:05.583
Why not try these two
recipes using wheat berries

00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:08.709
of the hard winter
wheat variety?

00:21:08.709 --> 00:21:13.083
Recipe number one, wheat berry
and mixed vegetable soup.

00:21:13.083 --> 00:21:15.709
Just prepare the
following ingredients.

00:21:15.709 --> 00:21:19.792
One cup of wheat berries, one
tablespoon of extra-virgin

00:21:19.792 --> 00:21:23.792
olive oil, two stalks
of thinly sliced celery,

00:21:23.792 --> 00:21:29.083
one medium diced onion, one
medium thinly sliced leek,

00:21:29.083 --> 00:21:31.917
one tablespoon of tomato paste,

00:21:31.917 --> 00:21:33.583
eight cups of vegetable broth,

00:21:33.583 --> 00:21:37.458
425 grams can of beans,
rinsed and drained,

00:21:37.458 --> 00:21:41.625
one teaspoon of dried thyme,
one stem of fresh basil,

00:21:41.625 --> 00:21:47.166
two large sliced carrots, and
four handfuls of baby spinach.

00:21:47.166 --> 00:21:52.125
In a pan, heat oil and sauté
celery, onion, and leek.

00:21:52.125 --> 00:21:56.875
Cover and cook it until
softened, about five minutes.

00:21:56.875 --> 00:21:59.000
Add wheat berries
and tomato paste.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.999
Combine well until
grains are coated.

00:22:02.999 --> 00:22:05.750
Put the beans, thyme,
basil, and half

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.458
of the broth, and
bring it to a boil.

00:22:08.458 --> 00:22:09.999
Simmer for 30 minutes.

00:22:09.999 --> 00:22:12.834
Add the carrots and
the rest of the broth.

00:22:12.834 --> 00:22:14.834
Cover again, and
cook over low heat

00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:18.583
for 30 minutes, or until
carrots are tender.

00:22:18.583 --> 00:22:20.999
Add spinach, remove
wilted basil,

00:22:20.999 --> 00:22:25.583
season with salt and
pepper, and then serve.

00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:29.709
Recipe number two, wheat
berry and tomato salad.

00:22:29.709 --> 00:22:33.166
You will need one cup of wheat
berries, rinsed and soaked

00:22:33.166 --> 00:22:37.041
for several hours, or overnight,
in four cups of water,

00:22:37.041 --> 00:22:41.999
salt and freshly ground pepper,
two cups of diced tomatoes,

00:22:41.999 --> 00:22:44.417
one tablespoon of
sherry vinegar,

00:22:44.417 --> 00:22:46.959
one teaspoon of
balsamic vinegar,

00:22:46.959 --> 00:22:51.709
one cup of diced celery or
cucumber or a combination,

00:22:51.709 --> 00:22:55.375
three tablespoons of freshly
squeezed lemon juice,

00:22:55.375 --> 00:22:58.375
three tablespoons of
extra-virgin olive oil,

00:22:58.375 --> 00:23:01.166
one half cup of
crumbled feta cheese,

00:23:01.166 --> 00:23:03.875
two tablespoons of
chopped fresh mint,

00:23:03.875 --> 00:23:08.417
and three tablespoons of
chopped fresh parsley.

00:23:08.417 --> 00:23:12.999
First, after soaking
the berries, transfer
both the berries

00:23:12.999 --> 00:23:15.667
and soaking liquid
to a large saucepan.

00:23:15.667 --> 00:23:19.583
You can add salt if you want,
then bring it to a boil.

00:23:19.583 --> 00:23:22.333
Reduce heat and
simmer for one hour,

00:23:22.333 --> 00:23:25.125
or until grains are tender.

00:23:25.125 --> 00:23:31.166
Remove from heat. Let it sit
for 15 minutes, and then drain.

00:23:31.583 --> 00:23:33.999
Second, put tomatoes in a bowl.

00:23:33.999 --> 00:23:36.000
Sprinkle with salt, and then add

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.709
the sherry and
balsamic vinegars.

00:23:38.709 --> 00:23:41.999
Combine well, and set aside.

00:23:41.999 --> 00:23:46.500
Third, toss the drained wheat
berries with the tomatoes.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.750
Let it marinate for
one hour, and then

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:50.750
add the rest of the ingredients.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:53.625
Combine well and serve
at once, or you can

00:23:53.625 --> 00:23:57.583
refrigerate it until
ready to serve.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.792
Whole wheat has
more fiber, protein,

00:24:00.792 --> 00:24:03.000
and minerals than
maize and rice.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.750
That's why when looking for
a staple food source, wheat

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:12.500
is definitely one grain that
will be on top of the list.
