00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
GEOLOGY IS ONE OF
THE PRIMARY SCIENCES.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
IT'S ALLOWED HUMANS TO
FIND SOME OF THE GREATEST

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
AND MOST IMPORTANT NATURAL
RESOURCES ON EARTH.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
IF YOU LOOK AROUND AT ALL
OF THE THINGS THAT YOU USE

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
IN EVERYDAY LIFE - THE
CLOTHES THAT YOU WEAR,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
THE DISHES YOU USE,
THE CAR YOU DRIVE IN,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
THE ENERGY TO RUN THAT CAR
- ALL OF THESE THINGS

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
ARE DIRECTLY EXTRACTED
FROM GEOLOGICAL MATERIALS.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
ENERGY IS ONE OF THE MOST
FUNDAMENTAL PARTS OF OUR

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
UNIVERSE AND AN ESSENTIAL
PART OF OUR LIVES.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
WE USE ENERGY TO GROW,
RUN OUR CARS AND PLANES,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
MAKE PRODUCTS AND, AS
WE GROW AND DEVELOP MORE

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
AND MORE WAYS TO USE
ENERGY, WE MUST FIND

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
AND CAPTURE RESOURCES
THAT PROVIDE

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
THE NECESSARY FUEL FOR
OUR DEMANDING LIFESTYLES.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
OUR BASIC SOURCE OF ENERGY
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
HAS BEEN FOSSIL FUELS.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
BEFORE THE INDUSTRIAL
REVOLUTION WE DIDN'T USE

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
THAT MUCH ENERGY.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
THE POPULATION HAS
EXPLODED SINCE THAT TIME

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
AND SO HAS OUR DEPENDENCE
ON FOSSIL FUELS.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
PETROLEUM, NATURAL GAS,
COAL - THESE ARE ALL

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
WHAT WE CALL THE
FOSSIL FUELS.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
FOSSIL FUELS - BOTH
WORDS ARE IMPORTANT,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
FUELS AND FOSSIL - ARE
THOSE NATURAL RESOURCES

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
THAT WERE CREATED BY
NATURAL PROCESSES ON EARTH

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
THAT ARE NOT CREATED
IN RECENT TIMES

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
BUT CREATED IN
VERY ANCIENT TIMES,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
SO LITERALLY MILLIONS
OF YEARS AGO.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
THEY'RE CALLED FOSSIL
FUELS BECAUSE

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
THEY REALLY ARE
FOSSILIZED ENERGY SOURCES.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
IN OTHER WORDS, ENERGY
FROM THE SUN A LONG TIME

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
IN THE PAST ALLOWED LIFE
TO PROSPER AND IN THE CASE

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
OF COAL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
ALL THE PLANTS IN A SWAMP.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
COAL IS MADE FROM
BASICALLY ORGANIC LIFE.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
YOU GO TO A SWAMP AND
SEE HOW MANY TREES

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
AND DECAYING
PLANTS THERE ARE.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
BASICALLY THAT'S HOW
COAL STARTS, YOU KNOW,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
IN THESE WET, VERY
ORGANIC ENVIRONMENTS.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
AND THEN IT'S LAYER
UPON LAYER OF THIS DEAD

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
DECAYING MATTER THAT GETS
BURIED AND PRESSURIZED.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
AND AS IT GETS
BURIED AND COMPACTED,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
IT WILL CHANGE ITS
STRUCTURE A LITTLE BIT.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
AND IN THE EARLY
STAGES IT WOULD BE A

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
SEDIMENTARY VARIETY OF COAL
THAT'S CALLED "LIGNITE".

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
BUT IF IT KEEPS
GETTING BURIED UNDER

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
METAMORPHIC CONDITIONS -
SO, TO HIGHER AND HIGHER

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
PRESSURES AND TEMPERATURES
- IT WILL GO THROUGH

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
A SERIES OF STAGES TO
ULTIMATELY WHAT'S CALLED

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
A HARD COAL OR
ANTHRACITE WHICH HAS

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
A VERY HIGH ENERGY
CONTENT PER UNIT VOLUME

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
AND BURNS WITH A VERY HOT
AND RELATIVELY CLEAN FLAME.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
COAL IS A VERY
EFFICIENT FOSSIL FUEL.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
FOSSIL FUELS ARE OFTEN
MEASURED BY HOW MUCH

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
THE PERCENTAGE OF
CARBON IN THEM AND COAL

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
CAN REACH PERCENTAGES
OF 90% TO 100% CARBON

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
SO IT'S ONE OF OUR MOST
EFFICIENT FOSSIL FUELS.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
COAL IS USUALLY
FOUND IN NARROW SEAMS

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
WITHIN LAYERS
OF THE EARTH.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
IT IS OFTEN MINED DEEP
UNDERGROUND IN COAL MINES.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
OTHER COAL IS MINED
ON THE SURFACE

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
WHERE THE LAND ABOVE
IS STRIPPED AWAY.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
AT THE MOMENT OUR
MAJOR ENERGY RESOURCE

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
IS PETROLEUM.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
MANY OF US THINK OF
THE PRODUCTS OF OIL

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
AS PRIMARILY BEING
GASOLINE, AND THAT'S TRUE

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
THAT ONE OF THE PRIMARY
PRODUCTS OF OIL IS GASOLINE,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT
FOR CITIZENS OF THE WORLD

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
TO UNDERSTAND
THAT THERE ARE

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
MANY OTHER
PRODUCTS OF OIL.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
IRONICALLY, ONE OF THE
MOST IMPORTANT OF THOSE

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
IS PLASTICS.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
IT IS THE MATERIAL
THAT WE USE TO MAKE

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
ALL OF OUR PLASTICS, MANY
OF OUR PHARMACEUTICALS,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
ALL OF OUR
SYNTHETIC FABRICS.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
PETROLEUM PRODUCTS INFLUENCE
SO MANY PARTS OF OUR LIVES.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
THE GLASSES
THAT YOU WEAR,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
THEY'RE USUALLY
PLASTIC LENSES.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
ROLLER BLADES,
FOOTBALL HELMETS,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
SO... THOUSANDS AND
THOUSANDS OF USES

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
FOR PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I GUESS WE ARE SORT OF
LIVING IN A PETROLEUM AGE.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
WE GET SO MUCH OF OUR
RESOURCES FROM PETROLEUM.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
WE HAVE OILS AND PLASTICS
AND IT IS INTERESTING

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
TO REALIZE WHERE
THAT ALL COMES FROM.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
IT'S GREAT WHEN PEOPLE
FIND THESE HUGE RESERVES

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
OF OIL, BUT THEY'VE
GOT TO REALIZE

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
THAT CAN'T HAPPEN
EVERYWHERE.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
IT HAS TO HAPPEN IN A
SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
AT A SPECIFIC TIME.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
OIL FORMS IN AREAS THAT WERE
AN OCEAN A LONG TIME AGO.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
THIS AREA, THE PERMIAN
BASIN, WAS THE PERMIAN SEA.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
THE PERMIAN BASIN IS
LOCATED IN WEST TEXAS

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
AND THE ADJOINING AREA OF
SOUTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
IT UNDERLIES AN AREA
APPROXIMATELY 250 MILES

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
WIDE AND 300 MILES LONG
AND IT CONTAINS AS MUCH

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
AS 17% OF THE UNITED
STATES' OIL AND GAS.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
ABOUT 250 MILLION YEARS AGO,
WHAT IS NOW NORTH AMERICA

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
AND WHAT IS NOW SOUTH
AMERICA ACTUALLY COLLIDED.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
AND WHAT THAT DID IS IT
BUCKLED THE EARTH AND MADE

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
THIS DEEP BASIN THAT THE
OCEAN WAS ABLE TO FLOW INTO.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
SO IT WAS ACTUALLY
AN INLAND SEA HERE.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
ALL ALONG THE EDGE OF
THAT INLAND SEA YOU HAD

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
A REEF GROWING AND
THIS IS MUCH LIKE THE

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
MODERN REEFS YOU'D SEE
IN THE BAHAMAS AND

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
THE GREAT BARRIER REEF
IN AUSTRALIA WITH THE

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
EXCEPTION THAT INSTEAD
OF BEING A CORAL REEF

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
THIS WAS MADE OUT OF
MOSTLY SPONGES AND ALGAE.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
AND OUT IN THE DEEP WATER
YOU ACTUALLY HAD CRITTERS

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
LIVING IN THE WATER
AND AS THEY DIED

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
THEY'D SINK DOWN
TO THE BOTTOM.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
WELL, ALL THAT ORGANIC
MATERIAL, AS IT GOT BURIED

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
BY MORE AND MORE STUFF AND
THEN EVENTUALLY WHEN THE

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
BASIN DRIED UP AND IT WAS
FILLED IN WITH SEDIMENT,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
UNDER ALL THAT
HEAT AND PRESSURE

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
THAT ORGANIC
MATERIAL TURNED INTO

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
WHAT WE KNOW
AS OIL AND GAS.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
ONCE YOU GO FROM DEAD ALGAE
INTO THIS NATURAL GAS

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
OR PETROLEUM, THOSE
THINGS ARE LIQUID AND GAS

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
AND THEY'RE TRAPPED
IN THE SOLID ROCK.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
THEY'RE MUCH LESS DENSE
THAN THE SOLID ROCK SO THEY

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
WANT TO MIGRATE TOWARDS
THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
IF THEY JUST MIGRATE
STRAIGHT TO THE SURFACE

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
OF THE EARTH THEY'D
DISSIPATE AT THE SURFACE

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
AND WE CAN NEVER
COLLECT THEM

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
IN ANY ECONOMIC
ABUNDANCE.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
WE CAN'T DRILL INTO
THEM, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
AND PUMP THE OIL OUT.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
SO, IN ORDER TO TRAP
THE OIL UNDERGROUND,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
YOU NEED TO HAVE, IN
ADDITION TO THE BURIAL

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
AT JUST THE RIGHT RATE,
YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
JUST THE RIGHT SEQUENCE
OF SEDIMENTARY ROCKS

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
SO THAT YOU HAVE A VERY
PERMEABLE ROCK THAT CAN

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
COLLECT ALL OF THE OIL
IN THE PORE SPACES

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
BETWEEN THE LITTLE SAND
GRAINS, FOR EXAMPLE.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
AND ABOVE THAT YOU NEED TO
HAVE AN IMPERMEABLE ROCK

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
LIKE A SHALE MADE OF
VERY FINE CLAY PARTICLES

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
WHERE THE OIL CAN'T
PENETRATE THROUGH IT

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
AND SO THAT FORMS A
SEAL ON TOP OF IT.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
THEN WE NEED TO HAVE
SOME KIND OF A STRUCTURE

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
LIKE A FOLD, FOR EXAMPLE,
THAT WE CAN DRILL INTO

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
WHERE THE OIL WILL
HAVE CONCENTRATED,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE
COULD NEVER PUMP IT OUT

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
AND HAVE IT
BE ECONOMIC.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
THE PRODUCTION OF
PETROLEUM PRODUCTS,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
THAT IS, YOU KNOW, THE
CRITTERS THAT MAKE PETROLEUM

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
- NAMELY THINGS LIKE
DIATOMS AND MARINE ALGAES -

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
FOR THEM TO "COOK"
UNDERGROUND

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
FOR MILLIONS OF
YEARS AND MAKE OIL

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
IS NOT IN ITSELF
REMARKABLE.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
THE FACT THAT THAT
OIL HAS FOUND PATHWAYS

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
AND PLACES WHERE IT CAN BE
STORED WITHIN THE EARTH,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
THOSE CONDITIONS ARE
SOMEWHAT MORE RARE.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
SO, IT IS A LITTLE
REMARKABLE THAT WE HAVE

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
AS MUCH PETROLEUM
AS WE DO,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
STORED AND CAPTURED WITHIN
THE CRUST OF THE EARTH.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
SO IT'S A VERY LONG AND
COMPLICATED SERIES

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
OF GEOLOGIC PROCESSES
THAT OCCUR OVER

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
TENS OF MILLIONS OF
YEARS IN ORDER TO TURN

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
A DEAD BIT OF ALGAE IN
THE OCEAN INTO SOMETHING

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
WE PUMP AT THE GAS STATION
AND PUT IN OUR CAR.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
THE OTHER THING THAT'S
INTERESTING ABOUT

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
PETROLEUM IS THAT IT CAN
BE REFINED IN MANY FORMS,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
SO IT'S MUCH MORE
THAN GASOLINE.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
WHEN YOU FIRST GET
OIL OUT OF THE GROUND

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
IT'S CALLED CRUDE OIL
AND WHAT YOU USUALLY GET

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
IS A MIXTURE OF
WATER, OIL AND GAS.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
WELL, THAT MIXTURE OF
CRUDE OIL IS REALLY NOT

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
WORTH VERY MUCH UNTIL YOU
BEGIN TO DIVIDE IT OUT.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
WE SEND IT THROUGH WHAT
WE CALL "HEATER TREATERS"

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
AND IT SIMPLY HEATS UP THE
MIXTURE AND THE WATER GOES

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
TO THE BOTTOM, THE
OIL FLOATS ON TOP,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
AND THEN THE GAS
ON TOP OF THAT.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
AND THAT'S ALL PIPED
OUT TO DIFFERENT PLACES.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
THE OIL GOES TO A REFINERY
WHERE IT IS HEATED

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
TO DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES
AND YOU GET EVERYTHING

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
FROM KEROSENE OR AIRPLANE
FUEL TO GASOLINE,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
EVEN THE THICKEST OF
THE TARS AND THEN

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
TO THE LIGHTEST THINGS
THAT ARE ALMOST A GAS,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
JUST VERY LIGHTWEIGHT.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
SO IT DEPENDS ON,
AS YOU REFINE IT,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
THE TEMPERATURES IN THAT
PRESSURIZING COLUMN

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO USE IT FOR.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
AND ITS COUSIN,
NATURAL GAS, WHICH IS

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
A SIMPLIFIED FORM AND A
GASEOUS FORM OF PETROLEUM

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
- A COUSIN OF OIL,
IF YOU WILL -

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
CAN OF COURSE BE USED
FOR MANY TYPES OF

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
TRANSPORTATION, HEATING
OF HOMES AND OFFICES

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
AND MANY OTHER
ASPECTS AS WELL.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
WHILE WE CAN ENJOY THE
MANY BENEFITS FROM

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
FOSSIL FUELS, THERE ARE
ALSO SERIOUS DOWNSIDES.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
ONE CONCERN IS THAT WHEN
WE BURN FOSSIL FUELS

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
FOR ENERGY, BYPRODUCTS
SUCH AS CARBON DIOXIDE,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
NITROGEN OXIDE AND
OTHER AIR POLLUTANTS

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
ARE RELEASED INTO THE
ATMOSPHERE AND CAN HAVE

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
SERIOUS HEALTH AND
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
INCLUDING
GLOBAL WARMING.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
AT THE MOMENT, PETROLEUM
OR OIL IS OUR MAJOR ENERGY

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
RESOURCE BUT WE'RE VERY
RAPIDLY USING UP THOSE

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
RESOURCES AND I THINK
FUTURE GENERATIONS ARE

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
GOING TO LOOK BACK
ON OUR TIME ON EARTH

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
AND REFER TO IT AS THE
"OIL AGE" AND IT WILL BE

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
A VERY, VERY SHORT
PERIOD IN HISTORY.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
ONE HUNDRED, TWO
HUNDRED YEARS MAXIMUM

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
AND IT'LL BE GONE.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
WE CAN'T WAIT ANOTHER TWO
OR THREE MILLION YEARS

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
FOR THIS MATERIAL
TO COME BACK,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
SO AS AN ENERGY
SOURCE IT'S DONE.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
IT'S NON-RENEWABLE.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
AND THE REALLY SAD
THING ABOUT THAT

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
IS THAT OIL HAS
SO MANY OTHER

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
USEFUL THINGS THAT
WE CAN DO WITH IT,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
BUT AS SOON AS WE PUT IT
IN THE ENGINE OF OUR CAR

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
WE BURN IT AND IT'S GONE
AND IT'S GONE FOREVER.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
WE CAN'T RECYCLE
IT - THAT'S IT.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
IT'S SORT OF CRIPPLING
IN A WAY BECAUSE

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE
NOT EVERYWHERE.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
WE CAN'T ALWAYS FIND THEM
OR, EVEN IF WE COULD,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
WE CAN'T NECESSARILY
ACCESS THEM.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
SO, AS A GEOLOGIST, A LOT
OF GEOLOGISTS THEIR JOB IS

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
TO FIND OIL, YOU KNOW,
WHICH IS GREAT BUT THERE

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
HAS TO BE SOME OTHER
RESOURCE TO BACK THAT UP.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
IN FACT, GEOLOGISTS
AND OTHER SCIENTISTS

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
ARE DEVELOPING
ALTERNATIVE RESOURCES

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
THAT MAY ONE DAY
REPLACE FOSSIL FUELS.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
BUT WITH ANY OF THESE IT
IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
THE BENEFITS, THE COSTS, AND
THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
THE OTHER SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERED SOURCE OF ENERGY

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
THAT'S ALTERNATIVE TO FOSSIL
FUELS IS NUCLEAR POWER.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
NUCLEAR ENERGY - THESE
THINGS CALLED ISOTOPES,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
THESE ATOMS THAT AREN'T VERY
HAPPY BEING WHO THEY ARE

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
AND THEY WANT TO DECAY
TO SOMETHING MORE STABLE -

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
SOMETHING CALLED
RADIOACTIVITY.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
WHEN THEY DECAY THEY
RELEASE ENERGY AND THE

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
SHORT ANSWER IS WHEN
THEY RELEASE ENERGY

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
IT'S USUALLY IN
THE FORM OF HEAT

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
AND WE CAN
HARNESS THAT HEAT

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
TO DRIVE TURBINES TO
GENERATE ELECTRICITY.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY
WHAT NUCLEAR POWER IS.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
NUCLEAR POWER IS
COMPLETELY CLEAN.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
THERE ARE NO CO2 OR OTHER
GASES THAT ARE GIVEN OFF

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
AS BYPRODUCTS.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
THE ONLY BYPRODUCT FROM
NUCLEAR POWER IS THE

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
NUCLEAR FUEL ITSELF WHICH
IS INCREDIBLY TOXIC,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS,
AND CONTINUES TO BE

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
RADIOACTIVE FOR TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
SO FOR US TO USE NUCLEAR
FUEL, WE HAVE TO REALLY

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
DEVELOP A COHERENT POLICY
FOR STORAGE, AND WE ALSO

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT
THERE ARE NO ACCIDENTS

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
WHERE THE FUEL
IS SPILLED.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
I THINK NUCLEAR POWER WOULD
BE A VIABLE POWER SOURCE

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
IF WE COULD SOLVE
THE PROBLEM

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
OF NUCLEAR
WASTE DISPOSAL.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
SO NUCLEAR FUEL HAS
ITS PROBLEMS, HOWEVER

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
IT IS RELATIVELY
CLEAN AND WE HAVE

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
A LOT OF NUCLEAR
FUEL SO WE COULD

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
SUPPLY US WITH ENERGY
FOR A LONG TIME TO COME.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
WHILE NUCLEAR
ENERGY CAN BE A

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
VIABLE ALTERNATIVE
RESOURCE,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
IT IS STILL CONSIDERED
A NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCE

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
BECAUSE THE FUEL THAT
GENERATES NUCLEAR ENERGY

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
IS LARGELY URANIUM
MINED FROM THE EARTH.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
SO IT IS STILL CONSIDERED
NON-RENEWABLE BECAUSE,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
LIKE FOSSIL FUELS, IT
CANNOT BE REPLENISHED.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
WE'RE NEVER GOING
TO RUN OUT OF WIND.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
WE'RE NEVER GOING
TO RUN OUT OF SUN -

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
AT LEAST NOT IN
OUR LIFETIME.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
SO WHY NOT USE SOME OF
THOSE OTHER RESOURCES?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES
CAN BE REPLENISHED NATURALLY

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME
OR OBTAINED FROM SOURCES

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY
INEXHAUSTIBLE.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
SO AN EXAMPLE OF THAT
WOULD BE SOLAR ENERGY.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S
READILY AVAILABLE TO US

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
AND SOMETHING THAT CAN
BE USED TIME AND AGAIN,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
AND WILL NOT GO
AWAY ANYTIME SOON.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
SOLAR IS STILL
SOMEWHAT IN ITS INFANCY

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
BECAUSE IT'S EXPENSIVE
AT THIS POINT.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
THAT SAID, THERE COULD
BE SOME MAJOR ADVANCES

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE
THAT MAKE IT ECONOMICAL.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
AND I'VE BEEN TOLD,
ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
SEEN THE FIGURES MYSELF,
THAT A 200 SQUARE MILE

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
PLOT OF LAND IS
SUFFICIENT TO GENERATE

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
ALL OF OUR POWER NEEDS FOR
THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
SO, IT'S SOMETHING
THAT'S POSSIBLE,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE
TO GET CHEAPER, AND

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
CERTAINLY SOLAR IS PERHAPS
THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
ANOTHER SOURCE OF
RENEWABLE ENERGY WOULD BE

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
OCEAN CURRENTS AS A
FORM OF HARNESSING

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
THE OCEAN'S TIDAL POWER
TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY -

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
AGAIN, A
RENEWABLE RESOURCE.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
SOMETHING THAT'S HERE,
IT'S IN ABUNDANCE,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT,
IN TERMS OF OUR HUMAN

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
TIME FRAME, WILL BE AROUND
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL
BE HOPEFULLY AVAILABLE

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
TO US FOR A
VERY LONG TIME.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
BIOMASS IS A RENEWABLE
ENERGY SOURCE BECAUSE

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
WE CAN ALWAYS GROW
MORE TREES AND CROPS.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
SOME EXAMPLES OF BIOMASS
FUELS ARE WOOD, CROPS,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
MANURE, AND SOME GARBAGE.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
WHEN BURNED, THE CHEMICAL
ENERGY IN BIOMASS

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
IS RELEASED AS HEAT.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
IF YOU HAVE A FIREPLACE,
THE WOOD YOU BURN IN IT

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
IS A BIOMASS FUEL.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
WOOD WASTE OR GARBAGE CAN
BE BURNED TO PRODUCE STEAM

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
FOR MAKING ELECTRICITY
OR TO PROVIDE HEAT

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
TO INDUSTRIES AND HOMES.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
MOST VOLCANIC
ACTIVITY OCCURS AROUND

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
THE PACIFIC OCEAN'S
RIM, THE RING OF FIRE.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
VOLCANIC ENERGY
CANNOT BE HARNESSED,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
THAT IS CONTROLLED
OR COLLECTED,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
BUT IN A FEW PLACES,
HEAT FROM THE EARTH

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
CALLED GEOTHERMAL
ENERGY CAN BE COLLECTED.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
USUALLY ENGINEERS TRY
TO COLLECT THIS HEAT

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
IN THE RARE PLACES
WHERE THE EARTH'S CRUST

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
HAS TRAPPED STEAM
AND HOT WATER.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
HYDROELECTRIC POWER, WHICH
IS SIMPLY WATER FALLING -

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
SO YOU HAVE WATER BEHIND
A DAM AND THAT GREAT

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
PRESSURE OF WATER BEHIND
THAT DAM SPINS A TURBINE

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
WHICH GENERATES
ELECTRICITY.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
THIS IS THE CHEAPEST FORM
OF ELECTRICITY WE HAVE.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
IT HAS DEFINITE SIDE
EFFECTS BECAUSE IT

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
REQUIRES DAMMING OF RIVERS
AND THE IMPEDIMENT OF FISH

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
TO BE ABLE TO
SWIM UPSTREAM.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
SO SALMON STOCKS
AND THINGS GO DOWN

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
WHEN YOU HAVE TO
PUT UP BIG DAMS.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
USING WATER AS AN ENERGY
SOURCE - YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
STRIKE A BALANCE, AGAIN,
BECAUSE YOUR BUILDING DAMS

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
AND EVERYTHING ARE A
TREMENDOUS SOURCE OF POWER.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I MEAN, WATER ENERGY DOES
SUPPLY A HUGE AMOUNT

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
OF THE POPULATION
WITH POWER.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE
TO BALANCE THAT WITH

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
SOME OF THE
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
OF BUILDING THESE
LARGE DAMS BECAUSE

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
YOU'RE INTERRUPTING THE
NATURAL FLOW OF WILDLIFE

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
BACK AND FORTH,
UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
AND THE REALLY LARGE DAMS
ARE CHANGING THE WHOLE

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
CHARACTER OF THE
RIVER UNDERNEATH.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
IF YOU LOOK AT GLEN
CANYON AT THE HEAD OF

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
THE GRAND CANYON, IT
USED TO BE, YOU KNOW,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
OCCASIONAL FLOODS, LOTS
OF SILT AND SEDIMENT,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
PRETTY WARM WATER FOR
THE MOST PART SO YOU HAD

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
DIFFERENT SPECIES THAT HAD
ACTUALLY ADAPTED TO THAT.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
WELL, NOW YOU'RE PULLING
VERY COLD WATER OUT OF THE

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
BOTTOM OF THE RESERVOIR,
OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
LAKE POWELL, AND PUTTING
THAT DOWNSTREAM.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
YOU'RE ALSO TRAPPING A LOT
OF THAT SEDIMENT UP ABOVE

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
THE DAM, SO YOU'RE REALLY
CHANGING THE ENVIRONMENT

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
AND IT'S A MATTER OF
STRIKING THAT BALANCE.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
ANOTHER LIMITATION OF
HYDROELECTRIC IS

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
YOU HAVE TO HAVE WATER AND
YOU HAVE TO HAVE TOPOGRAPHY -

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
THAT IS, YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A BIG ELEVATION CHANGE

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
SO THE WATER
CAN FALL DOWN.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
HYDROELECTRIC HAS PRETTY
MUCH BEEN TAPPED OUT

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
IN THIS COUNTRY IN TERMS OF
MAJOR ELECTRICAL SOURCES.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
MORE AND MORE - PARTICULARLY
IN THE UNITED STATES -

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO
TAP MORE INTO WIND POWER.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
YOU'RE SEEING A LOT MORE
OF THE WIND FARMS COME UP

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
AND A LOT OF THAT
HAS ALSO BEEN DRIVEN

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
BY THE TECHNOLOGY.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
IT USED TO BE, SOME
OF THE EARLY ONES

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
DIDN'T LAST VERY
LONG SO YOU COULD

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
ALMOST NEVER
RECOUP YOUR MONEY.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
THEY WERE ALSO BAD
ON WILDLIFE, TOO.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
SOME OF THEM, THE BLADES
MOVED SO FAST THAT THINGS

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
LIKE BIRDS, PARTICULARLY
SOME OF THE RAPTORS,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
COULDN'T SEE THE BLADES AND
WOULD ACTUALLY FLY INTO THEM.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
THEY'VE NOW REDESIGNED
THEM SO THEY ACTUALLY

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
MOVE VERY SLOWLY EVEN
THOUGH THEY STILL

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
GENERATE A
LOT OF POWER.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
AND THEY'RE FINDING MUCH
LESS MORTALITY IN THE

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
BIRD SPECIES THAT IT USED
TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF
THE REASONS WE'RE SEEING

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
MORE AND MORE WIND
POWER BEING USED.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
IN THE 1970'S IF YOU LOOKED
AT THE PRICE FOR ELECTRICITY

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
FROM WIND POWER IT WAS ABOUT
35 CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
AS OPPOSED TO THREE
CENTS FOR COAL.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
SO IT WASN'T EVEN
CLOSE TO COMPARABLE.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
TODAY, THE TWO HAVE
LITERALLY CROSSED OVER

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
SO THAT WIND POWER IS
CHEAPER THAN ELECTRICITY

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
GENERATED FROM A NATURAL GAS
PLANT OR OIL-FIRED PLANT,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.000
OR EVEN CLOSE TO THE COST
OF A COAL-FIRED POWER PLANT.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
WE'RE DEFINITELY
WELL ENTRENCHED IN

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
A PETROLEUM AGE IN THAT
ALMOST EVERY ECONOMY

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
ON THE PLANET IS A
PETROLEUM-BASED ECONOMY.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
WHAT'S NEXT IS A
VERY GOOD QUESTION.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
THERE ARE MYRIAD
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
AND A LOT OF VERY
CLEVER PEOPLE OUT THERE

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
TO MAKE THESE
THINGS WORK.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T
THINK IT'S ECONOMICALLY

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
VIABLE YET TO MAKE A STEP
INTO EXCLUSIVELY SOLAR OR

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
EXCLUSIVELY WIND-POWERED
ENERGY GENERATION.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT
COST-EFFECTIVE TO DO THAT,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
MAINLY BECAUSE WE ARE
FUELED, AS IT WERE,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
BY PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND
THAT'S WHAT EVERYTHING

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
IS BASED ON.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
BUT WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUT
OF PETROLEUM VERY SOON.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
AT THE PRESENT RATE OF
CONSUMPTION WHICH IS

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
NOT GETTING ANY LESS, AND
THE FACT THAT FOSSIL FUELS

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
ARE A FINITE, NOT A
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO THINK OF SOMETHING

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
PRETTY DARNED FAST.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
WIND, SUN, WATER
- WE CANNOT RELY ON

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
FOSSIL FUELS FOREVER, AND
AS WE DEVELOP MORE WAYS

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
TO INSURE WE HAVE THE
ENERGY FOR OUR FUTURE,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
WE MUST ALSO
REMEMBER ENERGY MAY

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
COME FROM UNEXPLORED
OR UNEXPECTED PLACES

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
AND THAT FUTURE
ENERGY SUPPLIES

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
MUST DELIVER ENOUGH
POWER FOR OUR LIFESTYLES

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:14.000
WITHOUT UNNECESSARY
DAMAGE TO OUR PLANET.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:35.000
