00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.470
THERE ARE SOME
GREAT QUESTIONS

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.500
THAT HAVE INTRIGUED
AND HAUNTED US

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.170
SINCE THE DAWN
OF HUMANITY.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.470
WHAT IS
OUT THERE?

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.570
HOW DID
WE GET HERE?

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.630
WHAT IS THE
WORLD MADE OF?

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.730
THE STORY OF OUR SEARCH
TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.830
IS THE STORY
OF SCIENCE.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.930
OF ALL HUMAN ENDEAVORS,
SCIENCE HAS HAD

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.370
THE GREATEST IMPACT
ON OUR LIVES -

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.970
ON HOW WE SEE THE WORLD,
ON HOW WE SEE OURSELVES.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.900
ITS IDEAS...

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.570
ITS ACHIEVEMENTS...

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.930
ITS RESULTS ARE
ALL AROUND US.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.930
BUT THE STORY OF SCIENCE
HAS BEEN SHAPED AS MUCH BY

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.300
WHAT'S OUTSIDE THE
LABORATORY AS INSIDE.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.370
POWER AND PASSION,
RIVALRY AND SHEER CHANCE

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.570
HAVE ALL PLAYED
SIGNIFICANT ROLES.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.170
THIS IS THE STORY OF HOW
HISTORY MADE SCIENCE

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.400
AND HOW SCIENCE
MADE HISTORY.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:33.330


00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.600
THIS WEEK, DELVING DEEP
TO FIND ORDER AND BEAUTY.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:53.470


00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.170
THE SEARCH TO UNDERSTAND
THE NATURE OF MATTER,

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.770
WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES
UP THE WORLD AROUND US

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.800
MAY SEEM LIKE AN ACADEMIC
AND ESOTERIC QUEST.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.470
BUT OVER THE MILLENNIA IT
HAS UNLOCKED ENORMOUS POWER

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.270
AND HAS RADICALLY
TRANSFORMED OUR WORLD.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:26.870


00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.170
THE FIRST PEOPLE WHO SET ABOUT
TO SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATE

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.870
WHAT THE WORLD IS MADE
OF WERE THE ALCHEMISTS.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.230
THEY FLOURISHED IN THE LATE
MIDDLE AGES, WORKING IN SECRET,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.870
PROTECTING THEIR KNOWLEDGE
WITH CODES AND CIPHERS.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.870
AN ALCHEMIST WAS
REALLY A PERSON WHO

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.630
I THINK WAS STRIVING TO
TRANSFORM THE WORLD,

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.700
TRANSFORM NATURE.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.730
THE THEORIES THEY
HAD THAT UNDERLAY

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.530
ALL OF THEIR OBSERVATIONS
WERE FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.330
SO THIS LED THEM INTO STRANGE
AND UNEXPECTED DIRECTIONS.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.000
THE ALCHEMISTS' IDEAS ABOUT
MATTER AND ITS VARIOUS FORMS

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.430
WERE DERIVED FROM
THE ANCIENT GREEKS.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.700
IT WAS A SYSTEM OF
BEGUILING SIMPLICITY.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.270
EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD
WAS A COMBINATION

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.630
OF JUST FOUR
IDEALIZED SUBSTANCES:

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:43.100
EARTH, WATER,
AIR, AND FIRE.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:51.100
BUT CRUCIALLY, ALCHEMISTS WERE
ALSO SKILLED, PRACTICAL MEN.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.900
DR. ANDREA SELLA WILL
ATTEMPT TO RECREATE A BIZARRE

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.770
EXPERIMENT PERFORMED BY
ONE OF THE LAST ALCHEMISTS,

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.600
A GERMAN NAMED
HENNIG BRAND.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.600
BRAND WAS TRYING TO CREATE THE
LEGENDARY PHILOSOPHERS STONE,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:17.970
A SUBSTANCE WITH THE POWER
TO TRANSFORM METALS.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.630
THE IDEA OF TRANSFORMING
THEM IN SOME WAY,

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.270
ALLOWING
THEM TO GROW,

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.730
ALLOWING THEM TO MOVE
TOWARD PERFECTION

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.700
IS A REALLY FUNDAMENTAL
IDEA IN ALCHEMY.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.430
WITH THE PHILOSOPHERS
STONE BRAND BELIEVED

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.370
HE COULD TRANSFORM
BASE METALS INTO GOLD

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.070
- THE MOST PERFECT AND
PRECIOUS METAL OF ALL.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.930
HE BEGAN HIS
EXPERIMENT

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.370
WITH A RATHER UNLIKELY
STARTING MATERIAL:

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.270
HUMAN URINE.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.300
ALCHEMISTS BELIEVED URINE
CONTAINED SPECIAL PROPERTIES

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.700
BECAUSE IT WAS PRODUCED
BY A LIVING BEING.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.170
BRAND STARTED BY
REDUCING IT INTO A PASTE.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.930
WELL, HERE IT IS.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.330
WE'VE BEEN BOILING IT
DOWN FOR SOME TIME

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.300
AND IT REALLY
IS QUITE SMELLY.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.870
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S
STARTING TO GET A BIT PASTY,

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.370
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF
WHITE SOLIDS IN THERE.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.100
SO, THERE WE ARE.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.970
I'M JUST GOING TO RUN IT
DOWN THIS GLASS ROD...

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.600
AND IT WOULD THEN HAVE BEEN
TRANSFERRED INTO A FURNACE,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.500
THE TRIAL BY FIRE,
IF YOU WILL.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.770
AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN
QUITE A FURNACE,

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.900
VERY HOT INDEED IN
ORDER TO DRY THIS.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:47.270


00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.700
IT INVOLVED GREAT
TECHNICAL SKILL,

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.700
MAKING THE FURNACE
AN APPARATUS

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:59.570
CONTROLLING TEMPERATURES
OVER 1,000 DEGREES CELSIUS.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.130
AS THE EXPERIMENT
WENT ON,

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.100
WHAT BRAND SAW WAS
UTTERLY STARTLING.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:14.570


00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.400
HE HAD TRANSFORMED THE
URINE INTO A SUBSTANCE

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.230
THAT HAD NEVER
BEEN SEEN BEFORE.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.070


00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.400
WHEN IT COOLED THE MATERIAL
TURNED INTO A PALE, WAXY SOLID.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.830
BUT EVEN MORE AMAZING IS
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT BURNS.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:44.330


00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.470
THERE REALLY IS POWER
IN THIS MATERIAL.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:56.100


00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.830
BRAND, OF COURSE, NEVER
FOUND THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.070
BUT THE SUBSTANCE HE HAD
DISCOVERED WAS NAMED

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:10.570
"GIVER OF LIGHT",
OR PHOSPHORUS.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.030
IT BECAME RATHER
IMPORTANT.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.630
IT WAS USED TO
MAKE THE MATCH.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.370
I THINK THE ALCHEMISTS
MADE HUGE CONTRIBUTIONS

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.500
TO WHAT WE NOW
KNOW AS CHEMISTRY.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.670
I MEAN, THEY WERE REALLY SORT
OF STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.970
THE WORLD AND WHAT THEY DID
WAS THEY FOUND METHODS

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.100
TO ACTUALLY ISOLATE
PURE CHEMICAL MATERIAL.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:38.300
THEY STARTED TO ASSEMBLE IDEAS
ABOUT HOW THE WORLD WORKED.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.770
THE EQUIPMENT AND
PRACTICES OF THE ALCHEMISTS

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.300
LAID THE FOUNDATIONS
UPON WHICH OUR

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.430
MODERN UNDERSTANDING
OF MATTER IS BUILT.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.770


00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.570
AS EUROPE MOVED OUT
OF THE MIDDLE AGES,

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:03.170
NEW FORCES STARTED
TO SHAPE SCIENCE.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.770
POWERFUL, ABSOLUTE MONARCHIES
RULED THE CONTINENT.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:14.430
THEY WERE HUNGRY FOR WEAPONS
AS THEY BATTLED FOR SUPREMACY

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:21.400
AND THAT LED TO A STRATEGIC NEED
FOR MORE AND BETTER METALS.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:27.870


00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.500
THE DEMAND FOR METALS
WAS UNRELENTING.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.670
AND DURING THE DIRTY BUSINESS
OF MINING FOR THEIR ORES,

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.030
A CHALLENGE TO
THE EXISTING IDEAS

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:41.730
ABOUT MATTER
STARTED TO EMERGE.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.930
FOR OVER A THOUSAND YEARS
AIR WAS CONSIDERED TO BE

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:49.030
A SINGLE SUBSTANCE, BUT
THE EXPERIENCE OF MINERS

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:54.370
DEEP UNDERGROUND
APPEARED TO CONTRADICT THIS.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.570
THERE WAS "BAD AIR",
WHICH KILLED MEN

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:03.370
AND MYSTERIOUSLY
EXTINGUISHED CANDLES...

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:10.630
"FIREDAM", WHICH EXPLODED
BELOW GROUND WITHOUT WARNING

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:14.000
AND THE WONDERFULLY
TITLED "PHLOGISTICATED AIR",

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.830
PRODUCED WHEN
THINGS BURNED.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.030
BUT WHAT WERE
THESE AIRS,

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.500
AND HOW MANY MORE
COULD THERE POSSIBLY BE?

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.000
ACROSS EUROPE EXPERIMENTERS
SET OUT FOR ANSWERS.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.800


00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.130
IN YORKSHIRE THE CHALLENGE
TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:42.800
WAS TAKEN UP BY THE NATURAL
PHILOSOPHER JOSEPH PRIESTLEY.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.170
A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS MAN, HE
STUDIED THE NATURAL WORLD

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:53.900
IN ORDER TO DISCOVER
MORE ABOUT GOD.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:59.900
PRIESTLEY STUDIED THE
AIRS THAT WERE RELEASED

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.130
BY HEATING DIFFERENT
SUBSTANCES...

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:09.030
INCLUDING AN OLD ALCHEMIST
FAVORITE, MERCURIUS CALCINATUS.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.030
MERCURY SALTS WERE VERY
COMMONLY USED IN MEDICINE

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.070
AND SO THEY WERE
VERY WIDESPREAD

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.430
AND SO STARTING
FROM MERCURIC OXIDE

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:21.130
WAS NOT REALLY
A GREAT SURPRISE.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:26.730
FIRST HE HEATED THE POWDER
TO A HIGH TEMPERATURE.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.800
SO AS WE HEAT HERE,
WHAT WE CAN SEE

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.730
IS THE MERCURIC
OXIDE DARKENING.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.930
IT WAS CHANGING.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:39.470
IT STARTED TO SPLIT INTO
ITS COMPONENT PARTS.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.730
SO WE CAN START
TO SEE THE MERCURY

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.370
AS A RATHER
SILVERY MIRROR.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.570
IT'S QUITE FAINT AT THE MOMENT
BUT THE MERCURY IS GRADUALLY

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.000
GOING TO BUILD UP AS WE
CONTINUE TO HEAT THE MATERIAL.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.430
NEXT, USING A NEW PIECE OF
EQUIPMENT CALLED THE PNEUMATIC

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:00.700
TROUGH, PRIESTLEY COLLECTED
THE AIR THAT WAS GIVEN OFF.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.170
AND THEN HE WOULD
HAVE BEEN IN A POSITION

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.130
TO ACTUALLY FIND
OUT WHAT IT DID.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:13.070


00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:19.270
HE HAD DISCOVERED AN
ENTIRELY NEW TYPE OF AIR.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.530
HE WAS BOTH ENCHANTED
AND PERPLEXED

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.200
BY ITS FIERY
PROPERTIES.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:31.170
BUT IT'S THE EVENTS THAT
FOLLOWED PRIESTLEY'S DISCOVERY

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.630
THAT WOULD REALLY MARK
IT AS A PIVOTAL MOMENT

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:40.100
IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF
WHAT THE WORLD IS MADE OF.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.900


00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:48.570
PARIS, 1774.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.600
WHILST ON A TRIP TO BUY
MORE MERCURIC OXIDE,

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.300
PRIESTLEY WAS INVITED
TO THE HOME OF THE

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.900
GOLDEN COUPLE OF FRENCH
EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE:

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:05.100
MARIE-ANNE AND
ANTOINE LAVOISIER.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.800


00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.500
HISTORIAN PATRICE BRET HAS BEEN
STUDYING LAVOISIER'S ARCHIVES

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.270
AT THE ACADEMIE
DES SCIENCES IN PARIS.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.930
AND THESE DOCUMENTS
REVEAL A VAULTING AMBITION:

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:28.700
TO REVOLUTIONIZE CHEMISTRY
THROUGH THE STUDY OF AIRS.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:34.730
TRANSLATOR: ON THE 20TH OF
FEBRUARY, 1773 LAVOISIER WRITES:

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:39.300
"THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT,
IN OTHER WORDS GASES AND AIRS,

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.670
HAS COMMITTED ME TO
RESUMING ALL THE WORK

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.970
WHICH I FEEL COULD
CREATE A REVOLUTION

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.970
IN PHYSICS
AND CHEMISTRY".

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.200
THEREFORE LAVOISIER
IS CONSCIOUS THAT

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.730
THE WORK ON THE
ROLE OF GASES

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:55.970
WILL COMPLETELY
REVOLUTIONIZE CHEMISTRY.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:13:01.530
SO WHEN PRIESTLEY TOLD LAVOISIER
ALL ABOUT HIS NEW FIERY AIR

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:08.570
HE SET OUT TO REPEAT
PRIESTLEY'S EXPERIMENT.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:14.700
AND HE WAS SOON
BOASTING OF <i>HIS</i> DISCOVERY

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.670
- THE SAME AIR, BUT
WITH A NEW NAME.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:24.730
HE CALLED IT
"OXYGEN".

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:29.030
IT'S THE GAS
OF LIFE.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:33.770
BUT IT'S NOT THE NAMING OF
THIS GAS THAT WOULD DEFINE

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:37.500
LAVOISIER'S IMPORTANCE
IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.270
IT'S WHAT
HE DID NEXT.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:45.970
HE DECIDED TO RUN THE
EXPERIMENT BACKWARDS.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.400
THE OXYGEN AND
MERCURY RECOMBINED

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.270
TO FORM THE
MERCURIC OXIDE.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.070
THIS MIGHT SEEM
SURPRISING IN ITSELF,

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.130
BUT THE REALLY SIGNIFICANT
THING THAT WOULD

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:02.900
TRANSFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING
OF MATTER IS THAT LAVOISIER

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:09.130
FOUND IT WEIGHED PRECISELY
THE SAME AS WHEN HE STARTED.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:14.000
NOTHING WAS CREATED,
NOTHING WAS DESTROYED.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.030
TRANSLATOR: LAVOISIER'S
IMPORTANCE IN TERMS OF

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.030
CHEMISTRY IS ESSENTIALLY
TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.530
THE LAW OF CONSERVATION
OF MASS IN ALL PHENOMENA,

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.200
IN ALL CHEMICAL
REACTIONS.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.330
THANKS TO HIM
AND HIS WORK,

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.870
THE VOCABULARY OF
CHEMISTRY BECAME ANALYTICAL.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.570
THIS ALLOWS US
TO UNDERSTAND

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:43.600
CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS
IN PARTICULAR.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:49.130
THE CONSERVATION OF MASS
MEANT THAT TRANSFORMATIONS

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:53.600
OF MATTER COULD BE ANALYZED,
DOCUMENTED, AND EXPLAINED.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.800
IT MARKS THE BEGINNING OF
A MODERN UNDERSTANDING

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.730
OF WHAT THE
WORLD IS MADE OF.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:06.230


00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:10.230
THE SCIENCE OF
CHEMISTRY EMERGED

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.130
THANKS TO THE
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:18.830
THE PRACTICAL SKILLS
OF THE ALCHEMISTS,

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.270
OF THE DISCOVERY
OF NEW GASES,

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:28.530
AND A DEDICATION TO
PRECISE MEASUREMENT.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:32.430
THIS NEW CHEMISTRY WAS
NOW POISED TO REPLACE

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.730
THE GREEK
UNDERSTANDING OF MATTER.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:44.670


00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.000
OUTSIDE THE LABORATORIES
OF THE RICH,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.370
18TH CENTURY SCIENCE
WAS DEVELOPING

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.530
A TASTE FOR THE
SPECTACULAR,

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:57.170
POWERED BY THIS
NEW INTEREST IN GASES.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:01.170
EACH YEAR THE SMALL
FRENCH TOWN OF ANNONAY

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.930
GATHERS TOGETHER TO
RECREATE THE TIME WHEN

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:09.630
AN ANCIENT DREAM OF TAKING TO
THE SKIES BECAME A POSSIBILITY.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.730
LEADING THE CELEBRATIONS
ARE DESCENDANTS OF A FAMILY

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.930
OF FAMOUS PAPER MAKERS
- THE MONTGOLFIER.

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:24.570
THEY WERE TO LAUNCH
THE FIRST HOT AIR BALLOON.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:28.470
TRANSLATOR: THEY HAD THE
IDEA OF TRAPPING HOT AIR

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.270
WITHIN A HUGE PAPER BAG
AND IT WAS THIS THAT

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.330
WENT ON TO BECOME
A HOT AIR BALLOON.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.600
AT FIRST THEY THOUGHT IT WAS
THE SMOKE THAT MADE IT RISE

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.230
BECAUSE THE SMOKE ROSE,
BUT THEY SOON REALIZED

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.830
IT WAS THE HOT
AIR THAT DID IT.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:50.970


00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.770
ON THE FOURTH OF JUNE,
1783, HERE IN ANNONAY

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:58.300
THE FIRST BALLOON, MADE
ENTIRELY OUT OF PAPER,

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.870
SOARED OVER A MILE
INTO THE HEAVENS.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:12.900


00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.730
SOON BALLOON MANIA GRIPPED
FRANCE AND A PRIZE WAS OFFERED

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:23.300
FOR THE FIRST BALLOON TO
CARRY A MAN INTO THE SKY.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.970
THE MONTGOLFIER SET OUT
TO BUILD A NEW BALLOON,

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.870
TWICE AS LARGE
AS THE FIRST.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:34.730
THIS TIME WITH A FIRE
SUSPENDED BENEATH.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.970
TRANSLATOR: THIS IS A
WONDERFUL BALLOON.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.530
IT'S A REPLICA IN
TERMS OF DESIGN,

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.730
BUT IT'S POWERED
WITH PROPANE.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.400
OF COURSE WE WEREN'T GOING
TO LUG STRAW AND WOOD

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.030
TO MAKE THIS
BALLOON FLY.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:57.900
IN NOVEMBER 1783 TWO BRAVE
VOLUNTEERS TOOK TO THE AIR

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.430
AND BECAME THE FIRST
HUMANS TO LOOK DOWN

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:06.700
AT THE SURFACE OF
THEIR OWN PLANET.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.100
TRANSLATOR: WELL, THEY MUST
HAVE FOUND IT EXTRAORDINARY,

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.400
MAYBE EVEN MORE EXTRAORDINARY
THAN GOING TO THE MOON.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:20.370
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT A MAN
HAD LIFTED OFF THE GROUND.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.870
IT WAS A HUGE ACHIEVEMENT
FOR THE MONTGOLFIER.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.800
BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR
THEM, IT WAS SHORT LIVED.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.070
JUST TEN DAYS LATER, MEMBERS
OF THE ACADEMIE DES SCIENCES

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.170
IN PARIS LAUNCHED
ANOTHER BALLOON

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:43.470
POWERED BY A NEWLY
DISCOVERED GAS: HYDROGEN.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:47.900
IT WAS 13 TIMES LIGHTER THAN
NORMAL AIR AND CONSIDERABLY

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.570
LESS DANGEROUS THAN USING
A BLAZING PILE OF STRAW.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.970


00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.370
THIS WAS SCIENCE
AS PUBLIC EVENT.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:02.830
HALF OF THE CITY OF PARIS
TURNED OUT TO WATCH.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:11.670
400,000 PEOPLE STARING UP INTO
THE HEAVENS IN AMAZEMENT.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:15.370
BUT IT LAID DOWN A
CHALLENGE TO THE CHEMISTS:

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.930
HOW COULD THEY MAKE
ENOUGH OF THIS NEW GAS

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.130
TO COLONIZE
THE SKIES?

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:24.830
TO FILL THE AIR WITH
FLOATING AERONAUTS?

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.330
THE CHALLENGE
WAS PICKED UP BY

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:32.470
THE CHAMPION OF
THE NEW CHEMISTRY:

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:36.470
ANTOINE LAVOISIER.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.830
EVER THE EXPERIMENTER,
HIS SOLUTION WAS DARING

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:43.470
AND IT WOULD DEAL A
BLOW TO ANOTHER OF THE

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:47.000
FUNDAMENTAL GREEK
SUBSTANCES...

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.300
WATER.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:57.900
LAVOISIER HAD A THEORY
THAT WATER WAS ACTUALLY

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:03.100
MADE OF TWO GASES -
HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.000
AND USING HIS NEW
UNDERSTANDING OF MATTER

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.800
HE DEVISED AN EXPERIMENT
TO SEPARATE THE TWO.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.930
SO HE WOULD HAVE FED WATER
IN FROM THIS SIDE AND LET IT

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:19.870
SORT OF DRIBBLE IN, AND THEN
HE PASSED IT DOWN AN IRON TUBE

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:23.270
AND THE IRON TUBE IS
HEATED TO RED HEAT

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:26.570
IN THIS KIND OF
BARBECUE ARRANGEMENT.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:31.600
THE OXYGEN IN THE WATER
SHOULD COMBINE WITH THE IRON

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.570
IN THE TUBE CAUSING IT
TO OXIDIZE, OR RUST.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:41.070
SO WE HAVE A NICE ZIGGURAT HERE
OF COALS ON TOP OF THE PIPE.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.870
AND BY RAISING THE
TEMPERATURE WHAT WE DO IS

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.930
WE ESSENTIALLY
SPEED UP THE REACTION.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:51.100
AS THE RUST FORMS,
THE OXYGEN IS SEPARATED

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.070
FROM THE WATER LEAVING
THE HYDROGEN BEHIND.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.430
AND THOSE BUBBLES CANNOT
BE STEAM BECAUSE THE STEAM

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.400
WOULD BE CONDENSED
HERE IN THE COPPER COIL,

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:06.100
AND SO THAT
MUST BE HYDROGEN.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.400
NOW FOR THE
MOMENT OF TRUTH.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.800
ARE WE READY?

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.270
WE'RE GOING TO PUT
THE SPLINT IN THERE.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:18.930
THERE'S NO QUESTION, THAT
"POP" SOUND YOU DO GET

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.870
WHEN
HYDROGEN IGNITES.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:25.000
LAVOISIER
SUCCEEDED.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.100
THEY COULD NOW MASS
PRODUCE HYDROGEN.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:33.570
THE POTENTIAL OF THE
GAS BALLOON WAS INSPIRING.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:38.630


00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.270
NAPOLEON SAW THE
STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.170
AND WAS ENCOURAGED TO
CREATE A BALLOON CORPS

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:49.470
CAPABLE OF INVADING
COUNTRIES FROM THE SKY.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.400


00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.900
AND THE TWO GASES
THAT MAKE UP WATER -

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.000
HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN -
WERE PART OF LAVOISIER'S

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.570
BOLD NEW VISION OF WHAT
THE WORLD IS MADE OF.

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:13.730
THE ELEMENTS: 33 IN ALL
- A LIST THAT INCLUDED

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:17.870
THE NEWLY
DISCOVERED GASES.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:21.230
BUT HE DIDN'T GET
IT ENTIRELY RIGHT.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:24.470
HE ALSO INCLUDED
HEAT AND LIGHT.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:31.430
IT WAS A TENTATIVE NEW LIST OF
THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF MATTER.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:37.270


00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:43.670
WE HAD NOW GONE DOWN A
LAYER TO REVEAL THE ELEMENTS.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:48.200
AND THIS NEW UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT THE WORLD IS MADE OF

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.800
WOULD IN TIME
RELEASE GREAT POWER.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:23:04.930


00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:09.630
THAT JOURNEY WOULD BEGIN
WITH AN ECCENTRIC ENGLISHMAN,

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:13.330
A BRILLIANT EXPERIMENTER
WITH A TASTE FOR

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:18.730
A CERTAIN MOOD-ALTERING
SUBSTANCE.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:25.300
(LAUGHTER)

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.930
THE CHEMIST, HUMPHREY DAVY,
WAS THE FIRST PERSON

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:32.800
TO DISCOVER THE
EFFECTS OF INHALING

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.800
NITROUS OXIDE,
OR LAUGHING GAS.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.070
HE FOUND IT WAS INTOXICATING
AND COULD INDUCE

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:46.370
HALLUCINATIONS AND
FEELINGS OF DREAMY EUPHORIA.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.100
LAUGHING GAS SOON
BECAME THE VOGUE

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.200
OF 19TH CENTURY
HIGH SOCIETY,

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:56.870
DRAWING SIGNIFICANT
ATTENTION TO DAVY HIMSELF.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:04.470


00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:11.630
IN 1801 HE LANDED A POST AT
THE ROYAL INSTITUTION IN LONDON

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:15.370
WHERE HE WAS TO
CARRY OUT RESEARCH

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.670
AND GIVE PUBLIC
LECTURES.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:21.470
DR. PETER WOTHERS FROM
CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.230
IS GOING TO RECREATE
THE EXTRAVAGANZA

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:28.470
THAT DAVY BROUGHT HERE
OVER 200 YEARS AGO.

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.900
CAREFULLY ADD A DROP...

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:36.870


00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:40.000
DRAWN TO HIS SPECTACULAR
DEMONSTRATIONS

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.200
WAS AN
ENTHUSIASTIC CROWD.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.430
YOUNG WOMEN WERE
ENAMORED BY

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:49.070
DAVY'S SHOWMANSHIP
AND CHARISMA.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:56.570
AS ONE PUT IT: "HIS EYES
WERE WASTED ON EXPERIMENTS".

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.030
AND SPRINKLED
THROUGHOUT THE AUDIENCE

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.600
WAS A NEW BREED
OF ENTREPRENEUR

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.130
EAGER TO GATHER VALUABLE
CHEMICAL INFORMATION.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:12.170


00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:18.230
BUT ONE OF HIS EARLY EXPERIMENTS
HERE AT THE ROYAL INSTITUTION

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.730
REALLY THRILLED
HIS AUDIENCE.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:25.000
HUMPHREY DAVY ORIGINALLY
PERFORMED THIS EXPERIMENT

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.200
IN THIS VERY LECTURE THEATER
TO A CROWDED AUDIENCE

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.270
WHO HAD NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:36.370
DAVY WAS THE FIRST TO DISCOVER
AN ELEMENT USING THE NEW

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:40.970
AND LITTLE UNDERSTOOD
POWER OF ELECTRICITY.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.230
WE'RE GOING TO ADD
A LITTLE POTASH HERE,

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:48.230
POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE
INTO THIS VESSEL,

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.000
AND WE NEED TO MELT
THIS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.970
CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
UNLESS IT'S MOLTEN.

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:58.000
THE FIRST TIME HE DID
THIS, DAVY HAD NO IDEA

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.530
WHAT HE WAS
ABOUT TO FIND.

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:08.300
THE ELECTRICITY SEEMED TO
BREAK APART THE MOLTEN POTASH

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:13.100
AND REVEAL ONE OF
ITS BUILDING BLOCKS -

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:18.470
AN ELEMENT WITH
A LILAC GLOW.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:22.500
HE CALLED IT
"POTASSIUM".

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.100
THE PURPLE FLAME IS
DUE TO THE REACTION

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.970
OF POTASSIUM AS
IT'S BEING FORMED

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.270
REACTING WITH THE
OXYGEN FROM THE AIR

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:32.000
INSTANTLY FORMING
THE WHITE SMOKE HERE.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.930
IT'S QUITE A
REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:38.330
TO ISOLATE THIS
REACTIVE METAL.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:42.770
DAVY HAD REVEALED AN ELEMENTAL
METAL THAT WAS SO VOLATILE

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:48.470
IT HAD NEVER EXISTED IN ITS
PURE FORM UNTIL THAT MOMENT.

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:51.800
DAVY REALIZED ELECTRICITY
HAD THE POWER

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.300
TO FURTHER OUR
UNDERSTANDING OF MATTER.

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:59.870
AND IN JUST TWO YEARS HE WENT
ON TO ISOLATE SIX NEW ELEMENTS

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.600
INCLUDING MAGNESIUM
AND CALCIUM.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.600


00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.100
BUT PERHAPS HIS
BIGGEST CONTRIBUTION

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.770
TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF
WHAT THE WORLD IS MADE OF

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.830
WAS TO DRAG CHEMISTRY
OUT OF THE LABORATORY

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:21.070
AND INTO THE
PUBLIC DOMAIN

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:24.670
PROMPTING MEMBERS OF HIS
AUDIENCE TO ASK THE QUESTIONS

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.130
WAS CHEMISTRY
USEFUL?

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:31.630
WAS THERE
MONEY IN IT?

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:37.270


00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:42.370
CHEMISTRY WAS POISED TO
BECOME A POWER IN THE WORLD.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.770
BUT THE JOURNEY IT
TOOK TO GET THERE

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:49.430
WAS WONDERFULLY
UNPREDICTABLE.

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:53.830
IT STARTS IN THE TROPICS WITH
A PROBLEM THAT PREOCCUPIED

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:58.700
THE EMPIRE BUILDERS
OF THE 19TH CENTURY:

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:02.000
MALARIA.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
THE DISEASE CARRIED BY THIS
TINY INSECT WAS ONE OF THE

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.400
GREATEST THREATS TO
IMPERIAL COLONIZATION.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.100
MALARIA WAS A HUGE PROBLEM
FOR THE NEW COLONIES,

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.570
IN PARTICULAR
INDIA

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:21.730
WHERE THEY LOST UP TO
TWO MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:27.730
AND ARMY RECORDS SHOW
THAT MILLIONS OF COLONIALS

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:31.400
AND ARMY MEMBERS
WERE ACTUALLY KILLED.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:36.930
JAMAICA - A FORMER BRITISH
COLONY - IS ONE OF THE PLACES

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:40.770
WHERE THEY
DEVELOPED A SOLUTION.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:44.200
AND IT CAN BE FOUND HERE
IN THE BLUE MOUNTAINS

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.630
AT THE CINCHONA
BOTANICAL GARDENS.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:50.530


00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:56.530
THIS IS THE CINCHONA TREE, ONE
OF THE LAST ONES IN JAMAICA.

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:59.970
AND YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT
THERE WERE PLANTATIONS

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.800
ALL AROUND THE GARDENS
HERE ON THE HILLSIDES

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.030
- HUNDREDS OF
ACRES OF THIS TREE.

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:10.870
NOW CAN YOU GIVE
ME A LITTLE BARK?

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:13.900
THE KEY TO ITS ROLE IN
THE FIGHT AGAINST MALARIA

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:18.270
IS TO BE FOUND LOCKED
AWAY IN ITS BARK.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:22.170
IT TASTES AWFUL...

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.270
MY GOD, IT
TASTES AWFUL.

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.230
BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY
CONTAINING QUININE

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:32.970
AND THIS IS WHAT CURED THE
FEVER WHICH WAS MALARIA.

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:36.800
QUININE, CONTAINED WITHIN THE
BARK OF THE CINCHONA TREE,

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:41.930
WAS THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST
THIS HORRENDOUS DISEASE.

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:45.530
THERE WAS AN INSATIABLE
DEMAND FOR THE STUFF.

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:52.200
THE BRITISH NEEDED 750
TONS A YEAR FOR INDIA ALONE.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:58.800
SO CINCHONA PLANTATIONS
WERE ESTABLISHED IN ALL

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.770
PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT
COULD GROW THE TREE.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:04.800
BUT THE MIRACLE
CURE FOR MALARIA

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.900
HAD A SIGNIFICANT
DRAWBACK.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.130
THIS IS A 20 YEAR
OLD TREE...

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:14.200
IN OTHER WORDS IT
GROWS EXTREMELY SLOWLY

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.530
AND IT WAS EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE ENOUGH

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:23.600
QUANTITIES OF QUININE FOR
THE ENTIRE WORLDWIDE MARKET.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:28.200
FACED WITH THIS PROBLEM,
GOVERNMENTS LOOKED

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:32.300
TO CHEMISTS TO COME UP
WITH A MANMADE ALTERNATIVE.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:36.270


00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.700
THE CHALLENGE TO
MAKE ARTIFICIAL QUININE

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.030
WAS TAKEN UP IN A MAKESHIFT
LAB IN LONDON'S EAST END

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:47.730
BY THE YOUNG
WILLIAM PERKIN.

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:55.330
HE BEGAN HIS SEARCH FOR QUININE
BY EXPERIMENTING WITH COAL TAR

00:30:55.330 --> 00:31:01.570
- A BYPRODUCT OF MAKING GAS
FOR THOUSANDS OF GAS LIGHTS

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:07.200
THAT LIT THE TOWNS AND
CITIES OF VICTORIAN BRITAIN.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.530
IT WAS NASTY STUFF.

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:15.530
A TOXIC COCKTAIL OF
CARCINOGENIC CHEMICALS.

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:21.000
TOM WELLS IS GOING TO
REPEAT PERKIN'S EXPERIMENT

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.830
USING SUBSTITUTES.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:29.330
COAL TAR WAS VERY CHEAP AT
THE TIME, PLENTY OF IT AROUND

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:32.370
AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU
COULD GET FROM COAL TAR

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:33.870
WAS ANILINE.

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:37.330
ANILINE WAS KEY FOR PERKIN
BECAUSE HE KNEW IT HAD

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:40.900
ROUGHLY THE SAME CHEMICAL
COMPOSITION AS QUININE.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.300
SO TO THAT HE ADDED
A BIT OF SULFURIC ACID

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.430
THAT WE USE IN CAR
BATTERIES TODAY,

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:48.600
AND THEN ADDED THE
MAGIC INGREDIENT,

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.600
THE POTASSIUM
DICHROMATE,

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.800
WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY
A CHEMICAL BLEND

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.170
THAT MAKES IT ALL
REACT TOGETHER.

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:57.170
AND PERKIN WAS JUST
HOPING THAT IT WOULD

00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:59.070
REACT IN THE RIGHT WAY
AND MAKE QUININE.

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:01.270
SO ONCE HE'D MIXED
THESE ALL TOGETHER,

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.170
ESSENTIALLY HE GOT
HORRIBLE BLACK GUNK

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:05.270
WHICH BY ANY STRETCH
OF THE IMAGINATION

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.900
IS A BIT OF
A FAILURE.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.430
IF I'D GOT THIS I'D HAVE
JUST THROWN IT IN THE BIN.

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:12.030
BUT PERKIN, HE WAS A
CONSIDERABLY BETTER

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:15.930
SCIENTIST THAN ME AND HE SAW
SOMETHING OF INTEREST IN THERE.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:20.130
WHAT PERKIN HAD NOTICED
WAS A FAINT BUT INTERESTING

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.030
BASE COLOR TO
THE BLACK GUNK.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:25.270
IT CERTAINLY
WASN'T QUININE

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:29.230
BUT HE DECIDED
TO FILTER IT OUT.

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:33.330
I HAVE TRIED THIS IN MY LAB
AND THIS IS WHAT I GOT -

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:35.900
THIS TINY AMOUNT
OF SOLID HERE.

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:40.400
SO WHAT PERKIN DID NEXT
WAS HE TOOK THIS SOLID

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.970
AND HE DISSOLVED IT
UP IN SOME METHANOL

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.700
JUST TO SEE WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN.

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.970


00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:54.370
AND THEN WHEN HE WHIPPED
OUT HIS SILK HANDKERCHIEF,

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:58.570
DIPPED IT IN...

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:03.330
PERKIN HAD ACCIDENTALLY
DISCOVERED THE COLOR MAUVE.

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:08.430
IT WAS THE FIRST
EVER SYNTHETIC DYE.

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:10.600
HE MAY NOT HAVE
MADE QUININE,

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.170
BUT HE DID CREATE
A FASHION SENSATION.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:20.400
THIS DRESS IS AN ORIGINAL,
DYED IN THE 1860'S.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:26.000
THE RICH AND FAMOUS WANTED TO
BE SEEN WEARING PERKIN'S MAUVE.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.500


00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:34.030
BY THE 1870'S HIS
FACTORY WAS MAKING

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:36.900
HUNDREDS OF TONS
OF DYE A YEAR

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.830
ADDING PERKIN'S GREEN
AND BRITANNIA VIOLET

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:45.000
TO HIS GROWING
CATALOG OF VIVID COLORS.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.370
PERKIN IS RIGHTLY
CELEBRATED AS

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:52.700
THE FATHER OF
INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.800
BUT THE LEAD SOON
PASSED TO GERMANY

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:59.900
WHERE INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTS
WORKED OUT HOW TO

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:03.900
MAKE AMMONIA WHICH LED
TO ARTIFICIAL FERTILIZERS

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:08.170
THAT TODAY SUSTAIN
THE GLOBAL POPULATION.

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:15.600


00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.170
BUT THE JOURNEY THAT
BEGAN IN THE TROPICS

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:23.100
WITH THE SEARCH FOR
QUININE ALSO LED HERE...

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:28.470
TO THE KILLING FIELDS
OF THE GREAT WAR.

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:31.700
THE SOLDIERS' UNIFORMS
WERE COLORED KHAKI

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:35.030
WITH ARTIFICIAL
DYES.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:40.300


00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.070
EXPLOSIVES WERE PRODUCED
BY THE SAME PROCESS

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:46.070
USED TO MAKE
FERTILIZERS.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:51.170
IT BROUGHT US THE HORRORS
OF POISONED GAS - CHLORINE

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:54.400
A GAS WHICH WAS USED
IN THE DYE INDUSTRY

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.300
THAT PERKIN
HAD PIONEERED.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:01.630
THE FIRST WORLD WAR HAS
BEEN DESCRIBED BY SOME

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:05.100
AS THE
CHEMIST'S WAR.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:11.100


00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:14.570
INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY BECAME
A FORCE IN WORLD HISTORY

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.530
THANKS TO THE
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:20.300
THE DISCOVERY
OF ELEMENTS,

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.370
THE GROWTH OF
EUROPEAN EMPIRES,

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:28.230
AND THE FIRST
SYNTHETIC DYE - MAUVE.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:31.230
BUT THE SEARCH FOR WHAT
THE WORLD IS MADE OF

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:35.730
WAS FAR
FROM OVER.

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:40.000
IN UNIVERSITIES
ACROSS THE WORLD,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.030
RESEARCHERS WERE
TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:46.770
WHAT THOSE ELEMENTS MIGHT
THEMSELVES BE MADE OF.

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:51.130


00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:54.170
THE MAIN THEORY WAS THAT
EVERY ELEMENT WAS MADE OF

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:59.370
TINY INDIVISIBLE CHUNKS
OF MATTER CALLED "ATOMS"

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:04.700
IMAGINED AS BEING
POLISHED BILLIARD BALLS

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:08.870
AND THESE ATOMS OF DIFFERENT
ELEMENTS JOINED TOGETHER

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:13.630
TO MAKE UP EVERYTHING
YOU CAN SEE OR TOUCH.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:19.230
THERE WAS JUST ONE TRICKY
PROBLEM WITH THIS THEORY:

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:21.230
PROOF.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:26.570
THEY WERE FAR TOO
SMALL FOR ANYONE TO SEE.

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:31.970
ONE OF THE FIRST CLUES TO THIS
THEORETICAL WORLD OF THE ATOM

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:37.700
WOULD COME FROM A
GLORIOUSLY UNEXPECTED SOURCE.

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.530
FROM THE WORLD OF
THE SUPERNATURAL.

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:45.070


00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.900
TO THE
MODERN MIND

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:50.200
WILLIAM CROOKES IS A
PUZZLING KIND OF SCIENTIST.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.200
HIS INTERESTS RANGE FROM
DISCOVERING NEW ELEMENTS

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.000
TO INVESTIGATING THE
WORLD OF SEANCES

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.930
AND SPIRITUAL
APPARITIONS.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:04.770
AT THE TIME THERE WERE
REPORTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:09.070
CLAIMING TO SHOW EVIDENCE
OF LEVITATION, ECTOPLASM,

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:13.330
AND COMMUNICATION
WITH SPIRITS.

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:21.070
CROOKES SET ABOUT A SCIENTIFIC
INVESTIGATION OF THEIR CLAIMS.

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:29.770


00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:33.730
CROOKES SPENT SOME OF
HIS TIME LOOKING AT SEANCES,

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:36.400
INVESTIGATING MEDIUMS, AND
WHEN HE WASN'T DOING THAT

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.370
HE WAS HERE INSIDE THE
LABORATORY INVESTIGATING

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:42.430
ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA
WITH DEVICES LIKE THIS

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:45.070
WHICH IS NOW CALLED
A CROOKES TUBE.

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:49.900
THERE'S AN EVACUATED GLASS
TUBE WHICH HAS GOT SOME AIR IN,

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.700
IT'S NOT COMPLETELY
EVACUATED...

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:55.270
BUT THERE IS GASES OF
LOW PRESSURE INSIDE HERE

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:57.900
AND THERE'S TWO ELECTRODES
- THERE'S A CATHODE,

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.270
WHAT WE CALL THE
NEGATIVE ELECTRODE,

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:04.000
AND THERE'S THE ANODE,
THE POSITIVE ELECTRODE.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.570
HE PASSED A HIGH VOLTAGE
ACROSS THE ELECTRODES

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:12.530
AND THE RESULT
WAS STRIKING.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:19.830
WAS THIS A
SPIRITUAL EMANATION?

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:23.700
WELL, CROOKES WAS A
CAREFUL EXPERIMENTER.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:27.700
HE FOUND THAT THE BEAM
COULD BE BENT WITH A MAGNET,

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:33.630
SUGGESTING IT WAS IN SOME
WAY ELECTRICAL IN NATURE.

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.430


00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:39.070
THAT IS PRETTY
CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:43.170
WHATEVER IT IS INSIDE THERE
IS ELECTRICALLY CHARGED.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:49.330
TO FIND OUT MORE, CROOKES
CAME UP WITH AN INGENIOUS PLAN.

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:56.200
HE SET ABOUT MAKING A NEW TUBE
WITH AN ADDITIONAL MODIFICATION

00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:00.770
- A TINY
PADDLEWHEEL.

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:04.570
SO I'M GOING TO SWITCH ON
AND LET'S SEE IF IT WORKS.

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:13.000


00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.830
THE FACT THAT THE PADDLEWHEEL
TURNED PROVED TO CROOKS THAT

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:20.130
THERE MUST BE SOME SORT OF
PARTICLES IN THE TUBE THAT WERE

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:24.400
BOMBARDING THOSE LITTLE VEINS
AND MAKING THE WHEEL TURN.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:29.000
THE CONCLUSION HE REACHED IN
THE END WAS THAT WAS EVIDENCE

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.330
THAT THERE'S SOME
FOURTH FORM OF MATTER.

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:34.270
WE ALREADY KNOW
ABOUT THREE

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:36.530
- THERE'S GASES,
SOLIDS, AND LIQUIDS -

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:39.400
AND CROOKES SAID PERHAPS
THERE'S A FOURTH STATE,

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.870
WHAT HE CALLED "RADIANT
MATTER" AND HE TRIED TO

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:44.700
BUILD UP A THEORY BASED ON
THIS SPECIAL RADIANT MATTER

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:48.430
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHAT
WAS HAPPENING INSIDE THE TUBE.

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:52.230
TRY AS HE MIGHT,
CROOKES COULDN'T FIND

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:55.870
SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
TO PROVE HIS THEORY.

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:58.670
BUT HIS WORK DID GO ON
TO INSPIRE ONE PHYSICIST

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:08.130
IN PARTICULAR: JOSEPH
JOHN THOMPSON, OR J.J.

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:12.370
HE BUILT MORE ACCURATE
AND SOPHISTICATED

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:15.800
VERSIONS OF THE
CROOKES TUBE

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.830
AND WITH THESE MANAGED TO
CALCULATE THAT THE PARTICLES

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:23.070
CAUSING THE WHEEL TO
TURN WERE ASTONISHINGLY

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:28.000
OVER A THOUSAND TIMES
SMALLER THAN AN ATOM.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.930
THEY WERE NAMED
"ELECTRONS"

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:38.330
- THE FIRST SUBATOMIC
PARTICLES TO BE DISCOVERED.

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:41.570
IT WAS AN ACHIEVEMENT
THAT GAINED J. J. THOMPSON

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:48.730
THE NOBEL PRIZE
FOR PHYSICS IN 1906.

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:51.570
A NEW LAYER OF
OUR UNDERSTANDING

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.070
OF WHAT THE
WORLD IS MADE OF

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:57.330
OPENED UP IN THE
EARLY 20TH CENTURY.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:01.370
THE WORLD WAS
MADE OF ATOMS AND

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:05.830
THEY WERE MADE UP OF THREE
FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES:

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:14.330
ELECTRONS ORBITING A NUCLEUS
OF PROTONS AND NEUTRONS.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:20.570
A SUITABLY GRAND LOCATION
TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:27.700
THE WORLD INSIDE AN ATOM IS
ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL IN LONDON.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:33.530
IT'S THE PERFECT PLACE
TO APPRECIATE ITS SCALE

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:39.030
AND PROPORTIONS.

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:42.900
THE NUCLEUS AT THE HEART OF
THE ATOM AND WHERE NEARLY

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:46.230
ALL THE MASS RESIDES
WOULD ACTUALLY BE

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:52.370
SMALLER THAN A
SINGLE GRAIN OF SAND.

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:57.170
THE REST IS
EFFECTIVELY A VOID.

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:00.900
EVERYTHING WE
THINK OF AS SOLID,

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:05.670
ALMOST ALL OF IT
IS EMPTY SPACE.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:11.530


00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:18.670
THE OTHER STRANGE THING
ABOUT THE INSIDE OF AN ATOM

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:24.200
IS THAT TRADITIONAL LAWS
OF PHYSICS DON'T APPLY.

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:29.900
EARLY ATOMIC THEORY ENVISAGED
THE ATOM AS A MINI SOLAR SYSTEM

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.470
WITH THE NUCLEUS
AS THE SUN

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:37.700
AND THE ELECTRONS THE
PLANETS ORBITING AROUND IT.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:40.930
BUT IT SOON BECAME
CLEAR THAT ELECTRONS

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:44.270
BEHAVED NOTHING
LIKE PLANETS.

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:47.700
THEY ARE NEVER
JUST IN ONE PLACE.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:53.200
THEY FLIT AROUND
IN MANY PLACES.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.570
BY THE ALTAR...

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:58.130
UP THERE IN
THE DOME...

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:01.700
ALL AT THE
SAME TIME.

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.800
A NEW THEORY WAS
REQUIRED TO EXPLAIN

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:09.930
THE STRANGE WORLD
INSIDE THE ATOM.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:12.430
THE BEHAVIOR OF
ELECTRONS CAN BE DESCRIBED

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:16.530
NOT AS CERTAINTIES
BUT AS PROBABILITIES.

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:19.470
NOT WHERE
ELECTRONS <i>WILL</i> BE,

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:22.700
BUT WHERE THEY
ARE LIKELY TO BE.

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:29.770
THE NEW THEORY WAS
KNOWN AS "QUANTUM".

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:34.300
NIELS BOHR, THE FATHER
OF QUANTUM PHYSICS,

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.300
ONCE SAID "THOSE WHO
ARE NOT SHOCKED BY IT

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:40.730
CANNOT POSSIBLY
HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT".

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:44.900
EVEN ALBERT
EINSTEIN SAID THAT

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:51.570
"GOD DOES NOT PLAY
DICE WITH THE UNIVERSE".

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:55.870
BUT QUANTUM THEORY
IS NONETHELESS

00:43:55.870 --> 00:44:00.870
THE FOUNDATION OF MODERN
TECHNOLOGICAL SOCIETY.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:06.430


00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:11.100
1945, AND A WARTIME
GENERATION CELEBRATED VICTORY

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:14.770
AND THE POSSIBILITY
OF PEACE AND PLENTY.

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:19.100
THEY DREAMED OF HOW TECHNOLOGY
COULD MAKE THEIR LIVES BETTER

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:25.800
AND BEHIND MANY OF THESE DREAMS
WAS THE SCIENCE OF THE ELECTRON.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:30.830
IT WAS A BRAND NEW WORLD,
AND WHAT MADE IT POSSIBLE

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:35.500
WERE THESE: VALVES.

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.800
A DISTANT RELATION
OF THE CROOKES TUBE,

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:44.630
THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY A WAY
OF CONTROLLING ELECTRONS.

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:47.270


00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:50.300
THEY WERE THE WORKHORSE
OF THE ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.800
THEY WERE USED TO AMPLIFY
ELECTRICAL SIGNALS IN RADIOS

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.370
AND TELEPHONE
EXCHANGES...

00:44:56.370 --> 00:45:01.330
AND TO SWITCH BINARY SIGNALS
IN THE EARLY COMPUTERS.

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:06.430
THEY WERE MANUFACTURED
BY THE MILLIONS.

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:10.470
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY
HAD SEVERAL DRAWBACKS.

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:15.700
THEY WERE BIG, REQUIRED A
LOT OF POWER, GOT REALLY HOT,

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:22.970
AND WERE INCREDIBLY
BREAKABLE.

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:25.970
BUT THE STRANGE WORLD
OF QUANTUM THEORY

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:28.930
WAS TO PROVIDE
A REPLACEMENT.

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:32.230


00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:35.270
IT WAS IN THE LAB OF
A TELEPHONE COMPANY

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:38.600
THAT QUANTUM
THEORY CAME OF AGE.

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.830
BELL LABS WANTED A
BETTER, CHEAPER WAY

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:44.400
OF CONNECTING
AMERICANS.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:49.430
AND TO DO THAT THEY NEEDED
TO REPLACE THE VALVE.

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:52.470
THEIR RESEARCH TEAM WAS
LED BY WILLIAM SHOCKLEY,

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:56.000
A SLICK, CLEVER, AND
RATHER DIFFICULT INDIVIDUAL,

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.070
BUT THEY CAME UP WITH
A QUANTUM SOLUTION:

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:04.600
THE WORLD'S
FIRST TRANSISTOR.

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.530
IT LOOKS SIMPLE, BUT
YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS DEVICE

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:10.530
JUST BY KNOWING
THAT ELECTRONS EXIST.

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:14.570
YOU NEED TO KNOW
HOW THEY BEHAVE.

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:18.530
QUANTUM THEORY ENABLED
SHOCKLEY'S TEAM TO PREDICT

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:22.270
HOW ELECTRONS WOULD
BEHAVE IN DIFFERENT MATERIALS.

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:25.400
WHICH MEANT THEY COULD
ENGINEER A SOLID STATE DEVICE

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.700
THAT COULD AMPLIFY AND
SWITCH ELECTRONIC SIGNALS

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:32.670
JUST LIKE A VALVE.

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:43.130
TRANSISTORS WERE SMALL, ROBUST,
AND REQUIRED VERY LITTLE POWER.

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:48.270
THEY UTTERLY
TRANSFORMED OUR WORLD.

00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:58.970


00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:04.330
AND IN JUST 60 YEARS
WE HAVE COME TO THESE:

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:14.170
MICROPROCESSORS THAT CONTAIN
BILLIONS OF TRANSISTORS.

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:17.200
THEY ARE THE
ULTIMATE EXPRESSION

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.370
OF THE GREAT POWER
THAT CAN BE UNLEASHED

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:24.830
FROM AN UNDERSTANDING
OF THE MATERIAL WORLD.

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:29.030


00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:32.200
DELVING EVER
DEEPER INTO MATTER

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:37.200
HAS UNDOUBTEDLY
CHANGED OUR SOCIETY.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:40.400
THE BUILDINGS WE LIVE
IN, THE WAY WE TRAVEL,

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.330
HOW WE
COMMUNICATE -

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:48.070
IN SHORT, OUR WAY OF LIFE
IS LARGELY A PRODUCT OF

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:53.070
OUR ATTEMPTS TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE WORLD IS MADE OF.

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:56.600


00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.930
BUT THIS JOURNEY
IS FAR FROM OVER.

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:02.530
THERE WILL BE NEW
LAYERS TO DISCOVER,

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:05.500
EVER MORE
STRANGE.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:09.630
IT COULD BE WHAT
SEEMS ODD NOW

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:14.630
IS SIMPLY WHAT WE DO
NOT YET UNDERSTAND.

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:22.270
