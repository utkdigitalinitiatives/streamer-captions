00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.770


3
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.570
Oh, I've been with your father

4
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.370
and given him notice that theDuke of Cornwall

5
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.770
and Regan, his duchess,

6
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.430
will be here with him thisnight.

7
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.670
How comes that?

8
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.130
Nay, I know not.

9
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.470
You have heard of the newsabroad.

10
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.170
Not I. Pray you, what are they?

11
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.270
Have you heard of no likely warstoward

12
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.000
'twixt Dukes of Cornwall andAlbany?

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.330
Not a word.

14
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.370
You may do, then, in time.

15
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.630
Fare you well, sir.

16
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.930
The duke be here tonight?

17
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.930
The better.

18
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.570
Best.

19
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.470
This weaves itself perforce intomy business.

20
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.130
My father hath set guard to takemy brother,

21
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.930
and I have one thing, of aqueasy question,

22
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.670
which I must act.

23
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.000
Briefness and fortune, work.

24
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.970
Brother, a word. Descend.

25
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.370
Brother, I say! Come.

26
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.770
My father watches.

27
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.170
O sir, fly this place.

28
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.870
Intelligence is given where youare hid.

29
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.200
You have now the good advantageof the night.

30
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.700
Have you not spoken 'gainst theDuke of Cornwall?

31
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.700
He's coming hither now, i' thenight, i' the haste,

32
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.800
and Regan with him.

33
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.300
Have you nothing said upon hisparty

34
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.730
'gainst the Duke of Albany?

35
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.870
Advise yourself.

36
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.270
I am sure on't, not a word.

37
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.200
I hear my father coming. Pardonme.

38
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.470
In cunning, I must draw my swordupon you.

39
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.500
Draw; seem to defend yourself.

40
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.630
Now quit you well.

41
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.700
Ha! Yield!

42
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.330
Come before my father!

43
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.470
Light, ho, here!

44
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.500
Fly, brother.

45
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.370
Torches, torches!

46
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.370
So farewell.

47
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.500
Some blood drawn on me wouldbeget opinion

48
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.800
of my more fierce endeavor.

49
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.670
I have seen drunkards do morethan this in sport.

50
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.270
Father, father!

51
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.430
Stop, stop!

52
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.530
What, no help?

53
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.930
Now, Edmund, where's thevillain?

54
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.030
Here stood he in the dark, hissharp sword out,

55
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.430
mumbling of wicked charms,

56
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.670
conjuring the moon to standauspicious mistress.

57
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.700
But where is he?

58
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.830
Look, sir, I bleed.

59
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.030
Where is the villain, Edmund?

60
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.070
Fled this way, sir.

61
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.400
When by no means he couldó

62
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.870
Pursue him, ho! Go after.

63
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.270
By no means what?

64
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.000
Persuade me to the murder ofYour Lordship.

65
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.470
O strong and fastened villain.

66
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.570
Would he deny his letter?

67
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.300
I never got him.

68
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.570
Hark, the duke's trumpet.

69
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.870
I know not why he comes.

70
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.900
All ports I'll bar.

71
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.500
The villain shall not 'scape.

72
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.200
The duke must grant me that.

73
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.600
And of my land, loyal andnatural boy,

74
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.430
I'll work the means to make theecapable.

75
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.070
How now, my noble friend?

76
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.230
Since I came hither, which I cancall but now,

77
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.900
I have heard strange news.

78
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.670
If it be true, all vengeancecomes too short

79
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.270
which can pursue the offender.

80
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.470
How dost, my lord?

81
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.570
O, madam, my old heart iscracked; it's cracked.

82
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.430
What, did my father's godsonseek your life?

83
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.700
He whom my father named? YourEdgar?

84
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.900
Lady, lady, shame would have ithid.

85
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.700
Was he not companion with theriotous knights

86
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.970
that tend upon my father?

87
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.670
I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad,too bad.

88
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.070
Yes, madam, he was of thatconsort.

89
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.530
No marvel, then, though he wereill affected.

90
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.770
'Tis they have put him onto theold man's death

91
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.300
to have the expense and waste ofhis revenue.

92
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.170
I have this present evening frommy sister

93
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.500
been well informed of them, andwith such cautions

94
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.300
that if they come to sojourn atmy house,

95
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.330
I'll not be there.

96
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.130
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.

97
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.430
Edmund, I hear that you haveshown your father

98
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.030
a child-like office.

99
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.630
It was my duty, sir.

100
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.630
He did bewray his practice andreceived this hurt you see

101
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.700
striving to apprehend him.

102
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.730
Is he pursued?

103
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.730
Ay, my good lord.

104
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.000
If he be taken,

105
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.700
he shall never more be feared ofdoing harm.

106
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.130
Make your own purpose, how in mystrength you please.

107
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.870
For you, Edmund, whose virtueand obedience

108
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.300

110
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.430
Natures of such deep trust shallwe much need.

111

You, we first seize on.

For him, I thank Your Grace.

114

You know not why we came tovisit you.

115
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.030
Thus out of season, threadingdark-eyed night.

116
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.930

to answer from home.

121

I' the mire.

132
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.400
Prithee, if thou lov'st me, tellme.

133
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.730
I love thee not.

134
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.430
Why, then, I care not for thee.

135
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.330
If I had thee in Lipsburypinfold,

136
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.870
I'd make thee care for me.

137
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.400
Why dost thou use me thus?

138
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.600
I know thee not.

139
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.570
O fellow, I know thee.

140
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.670
What dost thou know me for?

141
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:58.670
A knave; a rascal; an eater ofbroken meats;

142
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:04.000
a base, proud, shallow,beggarly, three-suited,

143
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.870
hundred-pound, filthy,worsted-stocking knave;

144
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.970
a lily-livered, action-taking,

145
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.070
whoreson, glass-gazing,super-serviceable finical rogue;

146
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.270
a one-trunk-inheriting slave;

147
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.870
one that wouldst be a bawd inway of good service

148
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.300
and art nothing but thecomposition

149
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.870
of knave, coward, beggar,pander,

150
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.770
and the son and heir of amongrel bitch;

151
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.800
and one whom I will beat intoclamorous whining

152
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.730
if thou deniest the leastsyllable of thy addition.

153

Why, what a monstrous fellow artthou thus to rail upon one

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.630
that is neither known of theenor knows thee.

155
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.270
What a brazen-faced varlet artthou

156
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.830
to deny thou knowest me.

157
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.600
Is it not two days since Itripped up thy heels

158
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.570
and beat thee before the king?

159

184
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.770
The messengers from our sisterand the king.

185
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.130
What's your difference? Speak.

186
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.800
I am scarce in breath, my lord.

187
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.600
No marvel, you have so bestirredyour valor.

188
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.230
You cowardly rascal, naturedisclaims in thee.

189
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.170
A tailor made thee.

190
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.600
Thou art a strange fellow.

191
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.100
A tailor make a man?

192
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.500
Ay, a tailor, sir.

193
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.230
A stone-cutter or a paintercould not have made him so ill,

194
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.700
though he had been but two hoursat the trade.

195
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.830
Speak yet. How grew yourquarrel?

196
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.430
This ancient ruffian, sir,

197
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.130
whose life I have spared at suitof his gray beardó

198
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.370
Thou whoreson zed!

199
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.730
Thou unnecessary letter!

200
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.330
My lord, if you'll give meleave,

201
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.270
I'll tread this unbolted villaininto mortar

202
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.130
and daub the wall of a jakeswith him.

203
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.570
Peace, sirrah!

204
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.800
You beastly knave, know you noreverence?

205
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.300
Yes, sir, but anger hath aprivilege.

206
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.570
Why art thou angry?

207
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.730
That such a slave as this shouldwear a sword

208
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.530
who wears no honesty.

209
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:30.000
Such smiling rogues as theserenege, affirm,

210
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.270
and turn their halcyon beaks

211
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.570
with every gale and vary oftheir master,

212
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.800
knowing naught, like dogs, butfollowing.

213
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.270
A plague upon your epilepticvisage!

214
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.800
Smile you my speeches as I werea fool?

215
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.230
Goose, if I had you upon Sarumplain,

216
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.300
I'ld drive ye cackling home toCamelot.

217
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.930
Why, art thou mad, old fellow?

218
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.570
How fell you out? Say that.

219
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.270
No contraries hold moreantipathy

220
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.900
than I and such a knave.

221
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.500
Why dost thou call him knave?

222
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.730
What is his fault?

223
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.200
His countenance likes me not.

224
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.430
No more, perchance, does mine,nor his, nor hers.

225
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.500
Sir, 'tis my occupation to beplain.

226
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.830
I have seen better faces in mytime

227
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.670
than stands on any shoulder thatI see before me

228
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.430
at this instant.

229
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.430
This is some fellow who,

230
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.870
having been praised forbluntness,

231
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.130
doth affect a saucy roughness

232
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.170
and constrains the garb quitefrom his nature.

233
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.830
He cannot flatter, he.

234
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.400
An honest mind and plain, hemust speak truth.

235
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.330
An' they will take it, so; ifnot, he's plain.

236
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.630
These kind of knaves I know,which in this plainness

237
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.230
harbor more craft and morecorrupter ends

238
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.200
than 20 silly ducking observants

239
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.030
that stretch their dutiesnicely.

240
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.030
Oh, sir, in good faith, insincere verity,

241
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.700
under the allowance of yourgreat aspect,

242
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.200
whose influence,

243
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.800
like the wreath of radiant fireon flickering Phoebus' frontó

244
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.130
What mean'st by this?

245
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.830
To go out of my dialect, whichyou discommend so much.

246
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.870
I know, sir, I am no flatterer.

247
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.330
He that beguiled you in a plainaccent

248
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.930
was a plain knave, which, for mypart, I will not be,

249
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.400
though I should win yourdispleasure

250
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.670
to entreat me to it.

251
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.830
What was the offense you gavehim?

252
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.270
I never gave him any.

253
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.770
It pleased the king, his master,very late to strike at me,

254
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.870
upon his misconstruction, whenhe,

255
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.430
compact and flattering hisdispleasure,

256
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.500
tripped me behind being down,insulted, railed,

257
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.500
and put upon him such a deal ofman

258
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.630
as worthied him, got praises ofthe king

259
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.200
for him attempting who wasself-subdued,

260
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.670
and, in the fleshment of thisdread exploit,

261
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.530
drew on me here again.

262
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:33.270
None of these rogues and cowardsbut Ajax is their fool.

263
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.270
Fetch forth the stocks.

264
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.400
You stubborn ancient knave, youreverend braggart,

265
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.670
we'll teach you.

266
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.500
Sir, I'm too old to learn.

267
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.770
Call not your stocks for me.

268
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.470
I serve the king,

269
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.000
on whose employment I was sentto you.

270
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.330
You shall do small respect, showtoo bold malice

271
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.000
against the grace and person ofmy master,

272
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.970
stocking his messenger.

273
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.570
Fetch forth the stocks.

274
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.370
As I have life and honor, thereshall he sit till noon.

275
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.470
Till noon?

276
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:10.900
Till night, my lord, and allnight too.

277
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.270
Why, madam, if I were yourfather's dog,

278
00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.130
you should not use me so.

279
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.900
Sir, being his knave, I will.

280
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.430
This is a fellow of theself-same color

281
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.070
our sister speaks of.

282
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.670
Come, bring away the stocks.

283
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.000
Let me beseech Your Grace not todo so.

284
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.170
His fault is much, and the goodking his master

285
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:27.300
will check him for 't.

286
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.400
Your purposed low correction

287
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.530
is such as basest andcontemned'st wretches

288
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.170
for pilferings and most commontrespasses

289
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.370
are punished with.

290
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:36.600
The king must take it ill

291
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.900
that he's so slightly valued inhis messenger

292
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.300
should have him thus restrained.

293
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.730
I'll answer that.

294
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.470
My sister may receive it muchmore worse

295
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.070
to have her gentleman abused,assaulted,

296
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.030
for following her affairs.

297
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.100
Put in his legs.

298
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.470
Come, my good lord, away.

299
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.670
I am sorry for thee, friend.

300
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.600
'Tis the duke's pleasure, whosedisposition,

301
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.530
all the world well knows, willnot be rubbed nor stopped.

302
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.600
I'll entreat for thee.

303
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.700
Pray, do not, sir.

304
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.300
I have watched and traveledhard.

305
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.370
Some time I shall sleep out; therest, I'll whistle.

306
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.770
A good man's fortune may growout at heels.

307
00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.030
Give you good morrow.

308
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:31.970
The duke's to blame in this;'twill be ill taken.

309
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:47.400
Good king, that must approve thecommon saw,

310
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:54.100
thou out of heaven's benedictioncomest to the warm sun.

311
00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.700
Approach, thou beacon to thisunder globe,

312
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:03.370
that by thy comfortable beams Imay peruse this letter.

313
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.470
Nothing almost sees miracles butmisery.

314
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:10.830
I know 'tis from Cordelia,

315
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.430
who hath most fortunately beeninformed

316
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.530
of my obscured course...

317
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:23.100
and shall find time from thisenormous state,

318
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.130
seeking to give losses theirremedies.

319
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:40.900
All weary and o'erwatched, takevantage, heavy eyes,

320
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.700
not to behold this shamefullodging.

321
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:50.530
Fortune, good night.

322
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:52.870
Smile once more.

323
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.770
Turn thy wheel.

324
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.770
I heard myself proclaimed

325
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.400
and, by the happy hollow of atree, escaped the hunt.

326
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.000
No port is free,

327
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.730
no place that guard and mostunusual vigilance

328
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.470
does not attend my taking.

329
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:22.170
Whiles I may 'scape, I willpreserve myself

330
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.430
and am bethought to take

331
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.370
the basest and most poorestshape

332
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.170
that ever penury, in contempt ofman,

333
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.000
brought near to beast.

334
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.230
My face, I'll grime with filth,

335
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.800
blanket my loins: elf all myhairs in knots,

336
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.630
and, with presented nakedness,

337
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.970
out-face the winds andpersecutions of the sky.

338
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.470
The country gives me proof andprecedent of Bedlam beggars,

339
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.530
who, with roaring voices,

340
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:51.700
strike in their numbed andmortified bare arms

341
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.030
pins, wooden pricks, nails,sprigs of rosemary

342
00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.370
and, with this horrible object,from low farms,

343
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:04.730
poor pelting villages,sheep-cotes, and mills,

344
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.630
sometime with lunatic bans,sometime with prayers,

345
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.830
enforce their charity.

346
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.930
Poor Turlygod.

347
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.870
Poor Tom.

348
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.070
That's something yet.

349
00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:28.600
Edgar, I nothing am.

350
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.830
'Tis strange that they should sodepart from home

351
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.170
and not send back my messenger.

352
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.970
As I learned, the night before,

353
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:37.670
there was no purpose in them ofthis remove.

354
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.030
Hail to thee, noble master.

355
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.770
Ah!

356
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.770
Mak'st thou this shame thypastime?

357
00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.300
No, my lord.

358
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.800
He wears cruel garters.

359
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.200
Horses are tied by the head,dogs and bears by the neck,

360
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.900
monkeys by the loins, and men bythe legs.

361
00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.630
When a man's over-lusty at legs,he wears wooden nether-stocks.

362
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.470
What's he that has so much thyplace mistook

363
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.670
to set thee here?

364
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.400
It is both he and she; your sonand daughter.

365
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.030
- No. - Yes.

366
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.370
- No, I say. - I say yea.

367
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.230
No, no, they would not.

368
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.300
Yes, they have.

369
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.630
By Jupiter, I swear, no.

370
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.630
By Juno, I swear, aye.

371
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.970
They durst not do it.

372
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.570
They could not, would not do it.

373
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.830
'Tis worse than murder,

374
00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.670
to do upon respect such violentoutrage.

375
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.400
Resolve me, with all modesthaste,

376
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.870
which way thou mightst deserve

377
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.330
or they employ this usage,coming from us.

378
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:31.630
My lord, when at their home,

379
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.730
I did commend your highness'letters to them.

380
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.430
'Ere I was risen from the placethat showed my duty kneeling,

381
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.030
came there a reeking post,stewed in his haste,

382
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.430
half breathless,

383
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.830
panting forth from Goneril, hismistress, salutations;

384
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.600
delivered letters, spite ofintermission,

385
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.600
which presently they read;

386
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.700
on whose contents, they summonedup their meiny,

387
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.900
straight took horse, commandedme to follow,

388
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.100
and attend the leisure of theiranswer,

389
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.000
gave me cold looks.

390
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.530
And meeting here the othermessenger,

391
00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.070
whose welcome, I perceived, hadpoisoned mineó

392
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.870
being the very fellow which oflate displayed

393
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.270
so saucily against yourhighnessó

394
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.200
having more man than wit aboutme, drew.

395
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.330
He raised the house with loudand coward cries.

396
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.270
Your son and daughter found thistrespass

397
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.670
worth the shame which here itsuffers.

398
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:20.530
Winter's not gone yet if thewild geese fly that way.

399
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:25.330
Fathers that wear rags do maketheir children blind,

400
00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:29.430
but fathers that bear bags shallsee their children kind.

401
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.470
Fortune, that arrant whore,

402
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.700
ne'er turns the key for thepoor.

403
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.330
But, for all this,

404
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:41.030
thou shalt have as many dolorsfor thy daughters

405
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.900
as thou canst tell in a year.

406
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:48.030
O, how this mother swells uptoward my heart.

407
00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.430
Hysterica passio, down.

408
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.770
Thou climbing sorrow, thyelement's below.

409
00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.200
Where is this daughter?

410
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.970
With the earl, sir, here within.

411
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.000
Follow me not. Stay here.

412
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.800
Made you no more offense butwhat you speak of?

413
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.870
None.

414
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.930
How chance the king comes withso small a number?

415
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:15.100
And thou hadst been set i' thestocks for that question,

416
00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.800
thou hadst well deserved it.

417
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.070
Why, fool?

418
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:21.870
We'll set thee to school to anant

419
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:26.430
to teach thee there's nolaboring in the winter.

420
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.600
All that follow their noses areled by their eyes

421
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.530
but blind men.

422
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.730
And there's not a nose among 20

423
00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.230
but can tell him that'sstinking.

424
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.500
Let go thy hold

425
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.500
when a great wheel runs down ahill,

426
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.330
lest it break thy neck withfollowing.

427
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.500
But the great one that goesupwards,

428
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.270
let him draw thee after.

429
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.970
When a wise man gives theebetter counsel,

430
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.870
give me mine again.

431
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.830
I'd have none but knaves followit,

432
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.030
since a fool gives it.

433
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.430
Where learned you this, fool?

434
00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:02.470
Not i' the stocks, fool.

435
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.870
Deny to speak with me?

436
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.630
They are sick? They are weary?

437
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.030
They have traveled all thenight?

438
00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.770
Mere fetches, the images ofrevolt and flying off.

439
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.700
Fetch me a better answer.

440
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.570
My dear lord, you know the fieryquality of the duke,

441
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.100
how unremovable and fixed he isin his own course.

442
00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.700
Vengeance, plague, death,confusion.

443
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.230
Fiery? What quality?

444
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.970
Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,

445
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:29.100
I would speak with the Duke ofCornwall and his wife.

446
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.670
Well, my good lord, I haveinformed them so.

447
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.130
Informed them?

448
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.600
Dost understand me, man?

449
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.670
Aye, my good lord.

450
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.930
The king would speak withCornwall.

451
00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.730
The dear father would with hisdaughter speak,

452
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.500
commands their service.

453
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.730
Are they informed of this?

454
00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.170
My breath and blood.

455
00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.270
Fiery? The fiery duke?

456
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.230
Tell the hot duke tható

457
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.700
no, but not yet.

458
00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.030
Maybe he is not well.

459
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.200
Infirmity doth still neglect alloffice

460
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.130
to which our health is bound.

461
00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.330
We are not ourselves whennature, being oppressed,

462
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.030
commands the mind to suffer withthe body.

463
00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:11.070
I'll forbear and am fallen outwith my more headier will

464
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.230
to take the indisposed andsickly fit

465
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.530
for the sound man.

466
00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.570
Death on my state!

467
00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.300
Wherefore should he sit here?

468
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.800
This act persuades me

469
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.400
that this remotion of the dukeand her is practice only.

470
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.400
Give me my servant forth!

471
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.100
Go tell the duke and 's wifeI'ld speak with them

472
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.770
now, presently.

473
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.530
Bid them come forth and hear me,or at their chamber-door,

474
00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:40.200
I'll beat the drum till it crysleep to death.

475
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.030
I would have all well betwixtyou.

476
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:53.970
O me, my heart, my rising heart.

477
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.800
But down.

478
00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.200
Cry to it, nuncle, as thecockney did to the eels

479
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.700
when she put 'em in the pastealive.

480
00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.400
She knapped 'em o' the coxcombswith a stick

481
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.270
and cried, "Down, wantons,down!"

482
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:09.170
It was her brother that, in purekindness to his horse,

483
00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.070
buttered his hay.

484
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.470
Good morrow to you both.

485
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:23.730
Hail to Your Grace.

486
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:25.570
I am glad to see Your Highness.

487
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.670
Regan, I think you are.

488
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.900
I know what reason I have tothink so.

489
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.570
If thou shouldst not be glad,

490
00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:41.230
I would divorce me from thymother's tomb,

491
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.400
sepulchering an adulteress.

492
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.730
O, are you free?

493
00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.530
Some other time for that.

494
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:51.030
Beloved Regan, thy sister'snaught.

495
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:55.570
O Regan, she hath tiedsharp-toothed unkindness,

496
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.570
like a vulture, here.

497
00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:58.970
I can scarce speak to thee.

498
00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.370
Thou'dst not believe with howdepraved a quality

499
00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.370
O Regan.

500
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.570
I pray you, sir, take patience.

501
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.200
I have hope you less know how tovalue her desert

502
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.370
than she to scant her duty.

503
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.200
Say, how is that?

504
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.670
I cannot think my sister in theleast

505
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.670
would fail in her obligation.

506
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.300
If, sir, perchance she haverestrained

507
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.100
the riots of your followers,

508
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.700
'tis on such ground and to suchwholesome end

509
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.200
that clears her from all blame.

510
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.670
My curses on her.

511
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.700
O, sir, you are old.

512
00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:33.000
Nature in you stands on the veryverge of her confine.

513
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.270
You should be ruled and led bysome discretion

514
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:39.130
that discerns your state betterthan you yourself.

515
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.200
Therefore, I pray you,

516
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.700
that to my sister you do makereturn.

517
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.230
Say you have wronged her, sir.

518
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.830
Ask her forgiveness?

519
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.030
Do you but mark how this becomesthe house?

520
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:55.030
"Dear daughter, I confess that Iam old.

521
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.770
"Age is unnecessary.

522
00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.330
"On my knees, I beg

523
00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.930
that you'll vouchsafe meraiment, bed, and food."

524
00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.870
Good sir, no more of theseunsightly tricks.

525
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:04.000
Return you to my sister.

526
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.170
Never, Regan.

527
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.700
She hath abated me of half mytrain;

528
00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.800
looked black upon me; struck mewith her tongue,

529
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.330
most serpent-like, about thevery heart.

530
00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:14.330
All the stored vengeances ofheaven fall

531
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:15.930
on her ingrateful top.

532
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.630
Strike her young bones, youtaking airs, with lameness.

533
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:19.700
Fie, sir, fie.

534
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:20.970
You nimble lightnings,

535
00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:23.670
dart your blinding flames intoher scornful eyes.

536
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.900
Infect her beauty, youfen-sucked fogs,

537
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:30.030
drawn by the powerful sun, tofall and blast her pride.

538
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:31.330
O the blest gods!

539
00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.300
So will you wish on me when therash mood is on.

540
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.730
Never, Regan.

541
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:36.830
Thou shalt never have my curse.

542
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:39.900
Thy tender-hefted nature shallnot give thee o'er

543
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.530
to harshness.

544
00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:49.530
Her eyes are fierce, but thinedo comfort and not burn.

545
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.900
'Tis not in thee to grudge mypleasures,

546
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.300
to cut off my train, to bandyhasty words,

547
00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.130
to scant my sizes, and, inconclusion,

548
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.630
to oppose the bolt against mycoming in.

549
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:04.700
Thou better knowest the officesof nature,

550
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.870
bond of childhood, effects ofcourtesy,

551
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.800
dues of gratitude.

552
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.700
Thy half o' the kingdom hastthou not forgot,

553
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.330
wherein I thee endowed.

554
00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.200
Good sir, to the purpose.

555
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.500
Who put my man in the stocks?

556
00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:20.630
What trumpet's that?

557
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.430
I know it; 'tis my sister's.

558
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:25.370
This approves her letter; shewould soon be here.

559
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.800
Is your lady come?

560
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.200
This is a slave whoseeasy-borrowed pride dwells

561
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.630
in the fickle grace of her hefollows.

562
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:36.530
Out, varlet, from my sight!

563
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.630
What means Your Grace?

564
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:41.370
How came my man i' the stocks?

565
00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.500
Regan, I have good hope thoudidst not know on't.

566
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.600
Who comes here?

567
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.300
O heavens, if you do love oldmen,

568
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.530
if your sweet sway allowobedience,

569
00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.300
if you yourselves are old, makeit your cause.

570
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.630
Send down and take my part.

571
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:05.300
Art not ashamed to look uponthis beard?

572
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.030
O Regan, will you take her bythe hand?

573
00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.370
Why not by the hand, sir?

574
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.070
How have I offended?

575
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.300
All's not offense

576
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.170
that indiscretion finds anddotage terms so.

577
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:19.230
O sides, you are too tough.

578
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:21.370
Will you yet hold?

579
00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:25.530
How came my man i' the stocks?

580
00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:27.500
I set him there, sir.

581
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.570
But his own disorders deservedmuch less advancement.

582
00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.170
You.

583
00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.200
Did you?

584
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.970
I pray you, father, being weak,seem so.

585
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.070
If, till the expiration of amonth,

586
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.370
you will return and sojourn withmy sister,

587
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:46.400
dismissing half your train, comethen to me.

588
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.870
I am now from home and out ofthat provision

589
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:51.170
which shall be needful for yourentertainment.

590
00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:53.900
Return to her and 50 mendismissed?

591
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.630
No, rather I abjure all roofs

592
00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:00.530
and choose to wage against theenmity of the air,

593
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.730
To be a comrade with the wolfand owl.

594
00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.570
Necessity's sharp pinch.

595
00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.000
Return with her?

596
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.330
Why, the hot-blooded France,

597
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.130
who dowerless took our youngestborn,

598
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.870
I could as well be brought toknee his throne

599
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:17.100
and, squire-like, pension beg tokeep base life afoot.

600
00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.530
Return with her?

601
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:20.630
Persuade me rather to be slaveand sumpter

602
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:22.130
to that detested groom.

603
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.130
At your choice, sir.

604
00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.700
I prithee, daughter, do not makeme mad!

605
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.600
I'll no more trouble thee, mychild.

606
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.170
Farewell, we'll no more meet, nomore see one another.

607
00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:40.400
And yet thou art my flesh, myblood, my daughter.

608
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.200
Or rather a disease that's in myflesh

609
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.670
which I must needs call mine.

610
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.330
Thou art a boil, a plague-sore,

611
00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:49.700
an embossed carbuncle in mycorrupted blood.

612
00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.830
But I'll not chide thee.

613
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:55.230
Let shame come when it will; Ido not call it.

614
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.830
I do not bid the thunder-bearershoot

615
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.330
nor tell tales of thee tohigh-judging Jove.

616
00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.670
Mend when thou canst; be betterat thy leisure.

617
00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:03.500
I can be patient.

618
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.530
I can stay with Regan, I and myhundred knights.

619
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.270
Not altogether so.

620
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:10.430
I looked not for you yet,

621
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.670
nor am provided for your fitwelcome.

622
00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.430
Give ear, sir, to my sister,

623
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:18.270
for those that mingle reasonwith your passion

624
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:22.870
must be content to think youold, and soó

625
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.400
but she knows what she does.

626
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.470
Is this well spoken?

627
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.870
I dare avouch it, sir.

628
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:29.900
What, 50 followers?

629
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.100
Is it not well?

630
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.070
What should you need of more?

631
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:36.200
Yea, or so many, sith that bothcharge and danger

632
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.500
speak 'gainst so great a number?

633
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.600
How, in one house, should manypeople,

634
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.830
under two commands, hold amity?

635
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:47.530
'Tis hard, almost impossible.

636
00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:49.870
Why might not you, my lord,receive attendance

637
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:53.330
from those that she callsservants or from mine?

638
00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:55.670
Why not, my lord?

639
00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:57.270
If then they chanced to slackye,

640
00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.070
we could control them.

641
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:04.300
If you will come to me for now Ispy a danger

642
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.600
I do entreat you bring but fiveand twenty.

643
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.070
To no more will I give place ornotice.

644
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:14.470
I gave you all.

645
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.770
And in good time, you gave it.

646
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:18.700
Made you my guardians, mydepositaries,

647
00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.370
But kept a reservation to befollowed

648
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.000
by such a number.

649
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.330
What, must I come to you withfive and twenty, Regan?

650
00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:26.430
Said you so?

651
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.800
And speak't again, my lord.

652
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.430
No more with me.

653
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.770
Those wicked creatures yet dolook more favored

654
00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:39.270
when others are more wicked.

655
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.200
Not being worst stands in somerank of praise.

656
00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.300
I'll go with thee.

657
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.730
Thy fifty yet doth double fiveand twenty,

658
00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:47.800
and thou art twice her love.

659
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.030
Hear me, my lord.

660
00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.770
What need you five and twenty,ten, or five,

661
00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.300
to follow in a house where twiceso many

662
00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.070
have a command to tend you?

663
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.130
What need one?

664
00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.370
O, reason not the need.

665
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:07.500
Our basest beggars are in thepoorest thing superfluous.

666
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.370
Allow not nature more thannature needs,

667
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:13.170
man's life is cheap as beast's.

668
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:14.800
Thou art a lady.

669
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.600
If only to go warm weregorgeous,

670
00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.500
why, nature needs not what thougorgeous wear'st,

671
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.600
which scarcely keeps thee warm.

672
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.770
But for true need

673
00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:25.670
heavens, give me that patience.

674
00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:27.930
Patience, I need!

675
00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.230
You see me here, you gods,

676
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:34.230
a poor old man as full of griefas age,

677
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:35.530
wretched in both.

678
00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:38.330
If it be you that stirs thesedaughters' hearts

679
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.170
against their father,

680
00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:44.130
fool me not so much to bear ittamely.

681
00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:48.600
Touch me with noble anger, andlet not women's weapons,

682
00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.130
water-drops, stain my man'scheeks.

683
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.670
No, you unnatural hags,

684
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.770
I will have such revenges on youboth

685
00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.530
as all the world shall

686
00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.900
I shall do such things

687
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.730
What they are, yet I know not,

688
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:08.670
but they shall be the terrors ofthe Earth.

689
00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.430
You think I'll weep.

690
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.870
No, I'll not weep.

691
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:18.970
I have full cause for weeping,but this heart shall break

692
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:23.000
into a hundred thousand flaws orere I'll weep.

693
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:30.530
O fool, I shall go mad.

694
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.500
Let us withdraw.

695
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.500
'Twill be a storm.

696
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.230
This house is little.

697
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:55.830
The old man and his peoplecannot be well bestowed.

698
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.000
'Tis his own blame hath puthimself from rest

699
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.500
and must needs taste his folly.

700
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.900
For his particular, I'll receivehim gladly

701
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.530
but not one follower.

702
00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:08.400
So am I purposed.

703
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.930
Where is my Lord of Gloucester?

704
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.900
Followed the old man forth.

705
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.900
He is returned.

706
00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.770
The king is in high rage.

707
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:18.100
Whither is he going?

708
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.770
He calls to horse, but will Iknow not whither.

709
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.530
'Tis best to give him way; heleads himself.

710
00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:24.530
Hear me, my lord.

711
00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:27.130
Entreat him by no means to stay.

712
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:28.770
Alas, the night comes on,

713
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.030
and the high winds do sorelyruffle.

714
00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.130
For many miles about, there'sscarce a bush.

715
00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:34.800
O, sir, to willful men,

716
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.730
the injuries that theythemselves procure

717
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:39.030
must be their schoolmasters!

718
00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.430
Shut up your doors.

719
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:44.570
He's tended by a desperatetrain,

720
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:48.500
and what they may incense himto,

721
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.830
being apt to have his earabused,

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.100
My Regan counsels well.

725
00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.770
Come, out of the storm.
