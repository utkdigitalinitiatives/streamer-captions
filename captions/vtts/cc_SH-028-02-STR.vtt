00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.770


3
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.570
Oh, I've been with your father

4
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.370
and given him notice that theDuke of Cornwall

5
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.770
and Regan, his duchess,

6
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.430
will be here with him thisnight.

7
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.670
How comes that?

8
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.130
Nay, I know not.

9
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.470
You have heard of the newsabroad.

10
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.170
Not I. Pray you, what are they?

11
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.270
Have you heard of no likely warstoward

12
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.000
'twixt Dukes of Cornwall andAlbany?

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.330
Not a word.

14
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.370
You may do, then, in time.

15
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.630
Fare you well, sir.

16
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.930

17
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.930
The better.

18
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.570
Best.

19
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.470
This weaves itself perforce intomy business.

20
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.130
My father hath set guard to takemy brother,

21
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.930
and I have one thing, of aqueasy question,

22
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.670
which I must act.

23
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.000
Briefness and fortune, work.

24
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.970
Brother, a word. Descend.

25
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.370
Brother, I say! Come.

26
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.770
My father watches.

27
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.170
O sir, fly this place.

28
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.870
Intelligence is given where youare hid.

29
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.200
You have now the good advantageof the night.

30
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.700
Have you not spoken 'gainst theDuke of Cornwall?

31
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.700
He's coming hither now, i' thenight, i' the haste,

32
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.800
and Regan with him.

33
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.300
Have you nothing said upon hisparty

34
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.730
'gainst the Duke of Albany?

35
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.870
Advise yourself.

36
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.270
I am sure on't, not a word.

37
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.200
I hear my father coming. Pardonme.

38
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.470
In cunning, I must draw my swordupon you.

39
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.500
Draw; seem to defend yourself.

40
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.630
Now quit you well.

41
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.700
Ha! Yield!

42
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.330
Come before my father!

43
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.470
Light, ho, here!

44
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.500
Fly, brother.

45
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.370
Torches, torches!

46
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.370
So farewell.

47
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.500
Some blood drawn on me wouldbeget opinion

48
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.800
of my more fierce endeavor.

49
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.670
I have seen drunkards do morethan this in sport.

50
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.270
Father, father!

51
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.430
Stop, stop!

52
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.530
What, no help?

53
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.930
Now, Edmund, where's thevillain?

54
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.030
Here stood he in the dark, hissharp sword out,

55
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.430
mumbling of wicked charms,

56
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.670
conjuring the moon to standauspicious mistress.

57
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.700
But where is he?

58
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.830
Look, sir, I bleed.

59
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.030
Where is the villain, Edmund?

60
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.070
Fled this way, sir.

61
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.400
When by no means he couldÃ³

62
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.870
Pursue him, ho! Go after.

63
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.270
By no means what?

64
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.000
Persuade me to the murder ofYour Lordship.

65
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.470
O strong and fastened villain.

66
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.570
Would he deny his letter?

67
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.300
I never got him.

68
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.570
Hark, the duke's trumpet.

69
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.870
I know not why he comes.

70
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.900
All ports I'll bar.

71
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.500
The villain shall not 'scape.

72
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.200
The duke must grant me that.

73
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.600
And of my land, loyal andnatural boy,

74
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.430
I'll work the means to make theecapable.

75
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.070
How now, my noble friend?

76
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.230
Since I came hither, which I cancall but now,

77
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.900
I have heard strange news.

78
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.670
If it be true, all vengeancecomes too short

79
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.270
which can pursue the offender.

80
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.470
How dost, my lord?

81
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.570
O, madam, my old heart iscracked; it's cracked.

82
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.430
What, did my father's godsonseek your life?

83
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.700
He whom my father named? YourEdgar?

84
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.900
Lady, lady, shame would have ithid.

85
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.700
Was he not companion with theriotous knights

86
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.970
that tend upon my father?

87
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.670
I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad,too bad.

88
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.070
Yes, madam, he was of thatconsort.

89
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.530
No marvel, then, though he wereill affected.

90
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.770
'Tis they have put him onto theold man's death

91
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.300
to have the expense and waste ofhis revenue.

92
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.170
I have this present evening frommy sister

93
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.500
been well informed of them, andwith such cautions

94
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.300
that if they come to sojourn atmy house,

95
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.330
I'll not be there.

96
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.130
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.

97
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.430
Edmund, I hear that you haveshown your father

98
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.030
a child-like office.

99
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.630
It was my duty, sir.

100
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.630
He did bewray his practice andreceived this hurt you see

101
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.700
striving to apprehend him.

102
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.730
Is he pursued?

103
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.730
Ay, my good lord.

104
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.000
If he be taken,

105
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.700
he shall never more be feared ofdoing harm.

106
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.130
Make your own purpose, how in mystrength you please.

107
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.870
For you, Edmund, whose virtueand obedience

108

Natures of such deep trust shallwe much need.

111

You, we first seize on.

You know not why we came tovisit you.

115
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.030
Thus out of season, threadingdark-eyed night.

116

to answer from home.

Prithee, if thou lov'st me, tellme.

133
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.730
I love thee not.

134
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.430
Why, then, I care not for thee.

135
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.330
If I had thee in Lipsburypinfold,

136
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.870
I'd make thee care for me.

137
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.400
Why dost thou use me thus?

138
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.600
I know thee not.

139
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.570
O fellow, I know thee.

140
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.670
What dost thou know me for?

141
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:58.670
A knave; a rascal; an eater ofbroken meats;

142
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:04.000
a base, proud, shallow,beggarly, three-suited,

143
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.870
hundred-pound, filthy,worsted-stocking knave;

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.970
a lily-livered, action-taking,

145
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.070
whoreson, glass-gazing,super-serviceable finical rogue;

146
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.270
a one-trunk-inheriting slave;

147
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.870
one that wouldst be a bawd inway of good service

148
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.300
and art nothing but thecomposition

149
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.870
of knave, coward, beggar,pander,

150
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.770
and the son and heir of amongrel bitch;

151
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.800
and one whom I will beat intoclamorous whining

152
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.730
if thou deniest the leastsyllable of thy addition.

153

Why, what a monstrous fellow artthou thus to rail upon one

that is neither known of theenor knows thee.

155
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.270
What a brazen-faced varlet artthou

156
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.830
to deny thou knowest me.

157
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.600
Is it not two days since Itripped up thy heels

184
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.770
The messengers from our sisterand the king.

185
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.130
What's your difference? Speak.

186
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.800
I am scarce in breath, my lord.

187
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.600
No marvel, you have so bestirredyour valor.

188
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.230
You cowardly rascal, naturedisclaims in thee.

189
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.170
A tailor made thee.

190
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.600
Thou art a strange fellow.

191
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.100
A tailor make a man?

192
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.500
Ay, a tailor, sir.

193
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.230
A stone-cutter or a paintercould not have made him so ill,

194
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.700
though he had been but two hoursat the trade.

195
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.830
Speak yet. How grew yourquarrel?

196
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.430
This ancient ruffian, sir,

197
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.130
whose life I have spared at suitof his gray beardÃ³

198
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.370
Thou whoreson zed!

199
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.730
Thou unnecessary letter!

200
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.330
My lord, if you'll give meleave,

201
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.270
I'll tread this unbolted villaininto mortar

202
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.130
and daub the wall of a jakeswith him.

203
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.570
Peace, sirrah!

204
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.800
You beastly knave, know you noreverence?

205
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.300
Yes, sir, but anger hath aprivilege.

206
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.570
Why art thou angry?

207
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.730
That such a slave as this shouldwear a sword

208
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.530
who wears no honesty.

209
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:30.000
Such smiling rogues as theserenege, affirm,

210
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.270
and turn their halcyon beaks

211
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.570
with every gale and vary oftheir master,

212
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.800
knowing naught, like dogs, butfollowing.

213
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.270
A plague upon your epilepticvisage!

214
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.800
Smile you my speeches as I werea fool?

215
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.230
Goose, if I had you upon Sarumplain,

216
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.300
I'ld drive ye cackling home toCamelot.

217
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.930
Why, art thou mad, old fellow?

218
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.570
How fell you out? Say that.

219
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.270
No contraries hold moreantipathy

220
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.900
than I and such a knave.

221
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.500
Why dost thou call him knave?

222
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.730
What is his fault?

223
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.200
His countenance likes me not.

224
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.430
No more, perchance, does mine,nor his, nor hers.

225
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.500
Sir, 'tis my occupation to beplain.

226
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.830
I have seen better faces in mytime

227
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.670
than stands on any shoulder thatI see before me

228
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.430
at this instant.

229
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.430
This is some fellow who,

230
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.870
having been praised forbluntness,

231
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.130
doth affect a saucy roughness

232
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.170
and constrains the garb quitefrom his nature.

233
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.830
He cannot flatter, he.

234
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.400
An honest mind and plain, hemust speak truth.

235
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.330
An' they will take it, so; ifnot, he's plain.

236
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.630
These kind of knaves I know,which in this plainness

237
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.230
harbor more craft and morecorrupter ends

238
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.200
than 20 silly ducking observants

239
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.030
that stretch their dutiesnicely.

240
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.030
Oh, sir, in good faith, insincere verity,

241
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.700
under the allowance of yourgreat aspect,

242
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.200
whose influence,

243
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.800
like the wreath of radiant fireon flickering Phoebus' frontÃ³

244
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.130
What mean'st by this?

245
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.830
To go out of my dialect, whichyou discommend so much.

246
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.870
I know, sir, I am no flatterer.

247
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.330
He that beguiled you in a plainaccent

248
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.930
was a plain knave, which, for mypart, I will not be,

249
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.400
though I should win yourdispleasure

250
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.670
to entreat me to it.

251
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.830
What was the offense you gavehim?

252
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.270
I never gave him any.

253
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.770
It pleased the king, his master,very late to strike at me,

254
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.870
upon his misconstruction, whenhe,

255
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.430
compact and flattering hisdispleasure,

256
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.500
tripped me behind being down,insulted, railed,

257
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.500
and put upon him such a deal ofman

258
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.630
as worthied him, got praises ofthe king

259
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.200
for him attempting who wasself-subdued,

260
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.670
and, in the fleshment of thisdread exploit,

261
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.530
drew on me here again.

262
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:33.270
None of these rogues and cowardsbut Ajax is their fool.

263
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.270
Fetch forth the stocks.

264
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.400
You stubborn ancient knave, youreverend braggart,

265
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.670
we'll teach you.

266
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.500
Sir, I'm too old to learn.

267
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.770
Call not your stocks for me.

268
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.470
I serve the king,

269
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.000
on whose employment I was sentto you.

270
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.330
You shall do small respect, showtoo bold malice

271
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.000
against the grace and person ofmy master,

272
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.970
stocking his messenger.

273
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.570
Fetch forth the stocks.

274
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.370
As I have life and honor, thereshall he sit till noon.

275
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.470
Till noon?

276
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:10.900
Till night, my lord, and allnight too.

277
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.270
Why, madam, if I were yourfather's dog,

278
00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.130
you should not use me so.

279
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.900
Sir, being his knave, I will.

280
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.430
This is a fellow of theself-same color

281
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.070
our sister speaks of.

282
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.670
Come, bring away the stocks.

283
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.000
Let me beseech Your Grace not todo so.

284
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.170
His fault is much, and the goodking his master

285
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:27.300
will check him for 't.

286
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.400
Your purposed low correction

287
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.530
is such as basest andcontemned'st wretches

288
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.170
for pilferings and most commontrespasses

289
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.370
are punished with.

290
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:36.600
The king must take it ill

291
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.900
that he's so slightly valued inhis messenger

292
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.300
should have him thus restrained.

293
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.730
I'll answer that.

294
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.470
My sister may receive it muchmore worse

295
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.070
to have her gentleman abused,assaulted,

296
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.030
for following her affairs.

297
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.100
Put in his legs.

298
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.470
Come, my good lord, away.

299
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.670
I am sorry for thee, friend.

300
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.600
'Tis the duke's pleasure, whosedisposition,

301
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.530
all the world well knows, willnot be rubbed nor stopped.

302
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.600
I'll entreat for thee.

303
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.700
Pray, do not, sir.

304
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.300
I have watched and traveledhard.

305
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.370
Some time I shall sleep out; therest, I'll whistle.

306
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.770
A good man's fortune may growout at heels.

307
00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.030
Give you good morrow.

308
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:31.970
The duke's to blame in this;'twill be ill taken.

309
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:47.400
Good king, that must approve thecommon saw,

310
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:54.100
thou out of heaven's benedictioncomest to the warm sun.

311
00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.700
Approach, thou beacon to thisunder globe,

312
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:03.370
that by thy comfortable beams Imay peruse this letter.

313
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.470
Nothing almost sees miracles butmisery.

314
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:10.830
I know 'tis from Cordelia,

315
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.430
who hath most fortunately beeninformed

316
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.530
of my obscured course...

317
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:23.100
and shall find time from thisenormous state,

318
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.130
seeking to give losses theirremedies.

319
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:40.900
All weary and o'erwatched, takevantage, heavy eyes,

320
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.700
not to behold this shamefullodging.

321
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:50.530
Fortune, good night.

322
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:52.870
Smile once more.

323
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.770
Turn thy wheel.

324
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.770
I heard myself proclaimed

325
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.400
and, by the happy hollow of atree, escaped the hunt.

326
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.000
No port is free,

327
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.730
no place that guard and mostunusual vigilance

328
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.470
does not attend my taking.

329
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:22.170
Whiles I may 'scape, I willpreserve myself

330
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.430
and am bethought to take

331
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.370
the basest and most poorestshape

332
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.170
that ever penury, in contempt ofman,

333
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.000
brought near to beast.

334
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.230
My face, I'll grime with filth,

335
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.800
blanket my loins: elf all myhairs in knots,

336
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.630
and, with presented nakedness,

337
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.970
out-face the winds andpersecutions of the sky.

338
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.470
The country gives me proof andprecedent of Bedlam beggars,

339
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.530
who, with roaring voices,

340
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:51.700
strike in their numbed andmortified bare arms

341
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.030
pins, wooden pricks, nails,sprigs of rosemary

342
00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.370
and, with this horrible object,from low farms,

343
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:04.730
poor pelting villages,sheep-cotes, and mills,

344
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.630
sometime with lunatic bans,sometime with prayers,

345
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.830
enforce their charity.

346
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.930
Poor Turlygod.

347
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.870
Poor Tom.

348
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.070
That's something yet.

349
00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:28.600
Edgar, I nothing am.

350
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.830
'Tis strange that they should sodepart from home

351
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.170
and not send back my messenger.

352
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.970
As I learned, the night before,

353
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:37.670
there was no purpose in them ofthis remove.

354
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.030
Hail to thee, noble master.

355
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.770
Ah!

356
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.770
Mak'st thou this shame thypastime?

357
00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.300
No, my lord.

358
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.800
He wears cruel garters.

359
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.200
Horses are tied by the head,dogs and bears by the neck,

360
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.900
monkeys by the loins, and men bythe legs.

361
00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.630
When a man's over-lusty at legs,he wears wooden nether-stocks.

362
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.470
What's he that has so much thyplace mistook

363
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.670
to set thee here?

364
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.400
It is both he and she; your sonand daughter.

365
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.030
- No. - Yes.

366
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.370
- No, I say. - I say yea.

367
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.230
No, no, they would not.

368
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.300
Yes, they have.

369
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.630
By Jupiter, I swear, no.

370
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.630
By Juno, I swear, aye.

371
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.970
They durst not do it.

372
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.570
They could not, would not do it.

373
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.830
'Tis worse than murder,

374
00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.670
to do upon respect such violentoutrage.

375
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.400
Resolve me, with all modesthaste,

376
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.870
which way thou mightst deserve

377
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.330
or they employ this usage,coming from us.

378
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:31.630
My lord, when at their home,

379
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.730
I did commend your highness'letters to them.

380
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.430
'Ere I was risen from the placethat showed my duty kneeling,

381
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.030
came there a reeking post,stewed in his haste,

382
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.430
half breathless,

383
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.830
panting forth from Goneril, hismistress, salutations;

384
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.600
delivered letters, spite ofintermission,

385
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.600
which presently they read;

386
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.700
on whose contents, they summonedup their meiny,

387
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.900
straight took horse, commandedme to follow,

388
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.100
and attend the leisure of theiranswer,

389
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.000
gave me cold looks.

390
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.530
And meeting here the othermessenger,

391
00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.070
whose welcome, I perceived, hadpoisoned mineÃ³

392
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.870
being the very fellow which oflate displayed

393
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.270
so saucily against yourhighnessÃ³

394
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.200
having more man than wit aboutme, drew.

395
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.330
He raised the house with loudand coward cries.

396
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.270
Your son and daughter found thistrespass

397
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.670
worth the shame which here itsuffers.

398
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:20.530
Winter's not gone yet if thewild geese fly that way.

399
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:25.330
Fathers that wear rags do maketheir children blind,

400
00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:29.430
but fathers that bear bags shallsee their children kind.

401
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.470
Fortune, that arrant whore,

402
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.700
ne'er turns the key for thepoor.

403
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.330
But, for all this,

404
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:41.030
thou shalt have as many dolorsfor thy daughters

405
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.900
as thou canst tell in a year.

406
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:48.030
O, how this mother swells uptoward my heart.

407
00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.430
Hysterica passio, down.

408
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.770
Thou climbing sorrow, thyelement's below.

409
00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.200
Where is this daughter?

410
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.970
With the earl, sir, here within.

411
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.000
Follow me not. Stay here.

412
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.800
Made you no more offense butwhat you speak of?

413
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.870
None.

414
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.930
How chance the king comes withso small a number?

415
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:15.100
And thou hadst been set i' thestocks for that question,

416
00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.800
thou hadst well deserved it.

417
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.070
Why, fool?

418
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:21.870
We'll set thee to school to anant

419
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:26.430
to teach thee there's nolaboring in the winter.

420
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.600
All that follow their noses areled by their eyes

421
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.530
but blind men.

422
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.730
And there's not a nose among 20

423
00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.230
but can tell him that'sstinking.

424
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.500
Let go thy hold

425
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.500
when a great wheel runs down ahill,

426
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.330
lest it break thy neck withfollowing.

427
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.500
But the great one that goesupwards,

428
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.270
let him draw thee after.

429
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.970
When a wise man gives theebetter counsel,

430
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.870
give me mine again.

431
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.830
I'd have none but knaves followit,

432
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.030
since a fool gives it.

433
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.430
Where learned you this, fool?

434
00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:02.470
Not i' the stocks, fool.

435
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.870
Deny to speak with me?

436
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.630
They are sick? They are weary?

437
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.030
They have traveled all thenight?

438
00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.770
Mere fetches, the images ofrevolt and flying off.

439
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.700
Fetch me a better answer.

440
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.570
My dear lord, you know the fieryquality of the duke,

441
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.100
how unremovable and fixed he isin his own course.

442
00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.700
Vengeance, plague, death,confusion.

443
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.230
Fiery? What quality?

444
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.970
Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,

445
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:29.100
I would speak with the Duke ofCornwall and his wife.

446
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.670
Well, my good lord, I haveinformed them so.

447
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.130
Informed them?

448
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.600
Dost understand me, man?

449
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.670
Aye, my good lord.

450
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.930
The king would speak withCornwall.

451
00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.730
The dear father would with hisdaughter speak,

452
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.500
commands their service.

453
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.730
Are they informed of this?

454
00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.170
My breath and blood.

455
00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.270
Fiery? The fiery duke?

456
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.230
Tell the hot duke thatÃ³

457
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.700
no, but not yet.

458
00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.030
Maybe he is not well.

459
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.200
Infirmity doth still neglect alloffice

460
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.130
to which our health is bound.

461
00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.330
We are not ourselves whennature, being oppressed,

462
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.030
commands the mind to suffer withthe body.

463
00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:11.070
I'll forbear and am fallen outwith my more headier will

464
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.230
to take the indisposed andsickly fit

465
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.530
for the sound man.

466
00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.570
Death on my state!

467
00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.300
Wherefore should he sit here?

468
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.800
This act persuades me

469
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.400
that this remotion of the dukeand her is practice only.

470
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.400
Give me my servant forth!

471
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.100
Go tell the duke and 's wifeI'ld speak with them

472
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.770
now, presently.

473
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.530
Bid them come forth and hear me,or at their chamber-door,

474
00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:40.200
I'll beat the drum till it crysleep to death.

475
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.030
I would have all well betwixtyou.

476
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:53.970
O me, my heart, my rising heart.

477
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.800
But down.

478
00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.200
Cry to it, nuncle, as thecockney did to the eels

479
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.700
when she put 'em in the pastealive.

480
00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.400
She knapped 'em o' the coxcombswith a stick

481
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.270
and cried, "Down, wantons,down!"

482
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:09.170
It was her brother that, in purekindness to his horse,

483
00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.070
buttered his hay.

484
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.470
Good morrow to you both.

485
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:23.730
Hail to Your Grace.

486
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:25.570
I am glad to see Your Highness.

487
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.670
Regan, I think you are.

488
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.900
I know what reason I have tothink so.

489
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.570
If thou shouldst not be glad,

490
00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:41.230
I would divorce me from thymother's tomb,

491
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.400
sepulchering an adulteress.

492
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.730
O, are you free?

493
00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.530
Some other time for that.

494
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:51.030
Beloved Regan, thy sister'snaught.

495
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:55.570
O Regan, she hath tiedsharp-toothed unkindness,

496
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.570
like a vulture, here.

497
00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:58.970
I can scarce speak to thee.

498
00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.370
Thou'dst not believe with howdepraved a quality

499
00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.370
O Regan.

500
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.570
I pray you, sir, take patience.

501
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.200
I have hope you less know how tovalue her desert

502
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.370
than she to scant her duty.

503
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.200
Say, how is that?

504
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.670
I cannot think my sister in theleast

505
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.670
would fail in her obligation.

506
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.300
If, sir, perchance she haverestrained

507
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.100
the riots of your followers,

508
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.700
'tis on such ground and to suchwholesome end

509
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.200
that clears her from all blame.

510
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.670
My curses on her.

511
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.700
O, sir, you are old.

512
00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:33.000
Nature in you stands on the veryverge of her confine.

513
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.270
You should be ruled and led bysome discretion

514
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:39.130
that discerns your state betterthan you yourself.

515
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.200
Therefore, I pray you,

516
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.700
that to my sister you do makereturn.

517
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.230
Say you have wronged her, sir.

518
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.830
Ask her forgiveness?

519
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.030
Do you but mark how this becomesthe house?

520
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:55.030
"Dear daughter, I confess that Iam old.

521
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.770
"Age is unnecessary.

522
00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.330
"On my knees, I beg

523
00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.930
that you'll vouchsafe meraiment, bed, and food."

524
00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.870
Good sir, no more of theseunsightly tricks.

525
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:04.000
Return you to my sister.

526
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.170
Never, Regan.

527
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.700
She hath abated me of half mytrain;

528
00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.800
looked black upon me; struck mewith her tongue,

529
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.330
most serpent-like, about thevery heart.

530
00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:14.330
All the stored vengeances ofheaven fall

531
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:15.930
on her ingrateful top.

532
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.630
Strike her young bones, youtaking airs, with lameness.

533
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:19.700
Fie, sir, fie.

534
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:20.970
You nimble lightnings,

535
00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:23.670
dart your blinding flames intoher scornful eyes.

536
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.900
Infect her beauty, youfen-sucked fogs,

537
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:30.030
drawn by the powerful sun, tofall and blast her pride.

538
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:31.330
O the blest gods!

539
00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.300
So will you wish on me when therash mood is on.

540
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.730
Never, Regan.

541
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:36.830
Thou shalt never have my curse.

542
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:39.900
Thy tender-hefted nature shallnot give thee o'er

543
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.530
to harshness.

544
00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:49.530
Her eyes are fierce, but thinedo comfort and not burn.

545
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.900
'Tis not in thee to grudge mypleasures,

546
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.300
to cut off my train, to bandyhasty words,

547
00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.130
to scant my sizes, and, inconclusion,

548
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.630
to oppose the bolt against mycoming in.

549
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:04.700
Thou better knowest the officesof nature,

550
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.870
bond of childhood, effects ofcourtesy,

551
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.800
dues of gratitude.

552
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.700
Thy half o' the kingdom hastthou not forgot,

553
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.330
wherein I thee endowed.

554
00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.200
Good sir, to the purpose.

555
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.500
Who put my man in the stocks?

556
00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:20.630
What trumpet's that?

557
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.430
I know it; 'tis my sister's.

558
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:25.370
This approves her letter; shewould soon be here.

559
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.800
Is your lady come?

560
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.200
This is a slave whoseeasy-borrowed pride dwells

561
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.630
in the fickle grace of her hefollows.

562
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:36.530
Out, varlet, from my sight!

563
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.630
What means Your Grace?

564
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:41.370
How came my man i' the stocks?

565
00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.500
Regan, I have good hope thoudidst not know on't.

566
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.600
Who comes here?

567
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.300
O heavens, if you do love oldmen,

568
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.530
if your sweet sway allowobedience,

569
00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.300
if you yourselves are old, makeit your cause.

570
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.630
Send down and take my part.

571
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:05.300
Art not ashamed to look uponthis beard?

572
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.030
O Regan, will you take her bythe hand?

573
00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.370
Why not by the hand, sir?

574
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.070
How have I offended?

575
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.300
All's not offense

576
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.170
that indiscretion finds anddotage terms so.

577
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:19.230
O sides, you are too tough.

578
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:21.370
Will you yet hold?

579
00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:25.530
How came my man i' the stocks?

580
00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:27.500
I set him there, sir.

581
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.570
But his own disorders deservedmuch less advancement.

582
00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.170
You.

583
00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.200
Did you?

584
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.970
I pray you, father, being weak,seem so.

585
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.070
If, till the expiration of amonth,

586
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.370
you will return and sojourn withmy sister,

587
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:46.400
dismissing half your train, comethen to me.

588
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.870
I am now from home and out ofthat provision

589
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:51.170
which shall be needful for yourentertainment.

590
00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:53.900
Return to her and 50 mendismissed?

591
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.630
No, rather I abjure all roofs

592
00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:00.530
and choose to wage against theenmity of the air,

593
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.730
To be a comrade with the wolfand owl.

594
00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.570
Necessity's sharp pinch.

595
00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.000
Return with her?

596
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.330
Why, the hot-blooded France,

597
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.130
who dowerless took our youngestborn,

598
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.870
I could as well be brought toknee his throne

599
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:17.100
and, squire-like, pension beg tokeep base life afoot.

600
00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.530
Return with her?

601
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:20.630
Persuade me rather to be slaveand sumpter

602
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:22.130
to that detested groom.

603
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.130
At your choice, sir.

604
00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.700
I prithee, daughter, do not makeme mad!

605
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.600
I'll no more trouble thee, mychild.

606
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.170
Farewell, we'll no more meet, nomore see one another.

607
00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:40.400
And yet thou art my flesh, myblood, my daughter.

608
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.200
Or rather a disease that's in myflesh

609
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.670
which I must needs call mine.

610
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.330
Thou art a boil, a plague-sore,

611
00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:49.700
an embossed carbuncle in mycorrupted blood.

612
00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.830
But I'll not chide thee.

613
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:55.230
Let shame come when it will; Ido not call it.

614
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.830
I do not bid the thunder-bearershoot

615
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.330
nor tell tales of thee tohigh-judging Jove.

616
00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.670
Mend when thou canst; be betterat thy leisure.

617
00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:03.500
I can be patient.

618
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.530
I can stay with Regan, I and myhundred knights.

619
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.270
Not altogether so.

620
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:10.430
I looked not for you yet,

621
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.670
nor am provided for your fitwelcome.

622
00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.430
Give ear, sir, to my sister,

623
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:18.270
for those that mingle reasonwith your passion

624
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:22.870
must be content to think youold, and soÃ³

625
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.400
but she knows what she does.

626
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.470
Is this well spoken?

627
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.870
I dare avouch it, sir.

628
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:29.900
What, 50 followers?

629
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.100
Is it not well?

630
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.070
What should you need of more?

631
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:36.200
Yea, or so many, sith that bothcharge and danger

632
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.500
speak 'gainst so great a number?

633
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.600
How, in one house, should manypeople,

634
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.830
under two commands, hold amity?

635
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:47.530
'Tis hard, almost impossible.

636
00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:49.870
Why might not you, my lord,receive attendance

637
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:53.330
from those that she callsservants or from mine?

638
00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:55.670
Why not, my lord?

639
00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:57.270
If then they chanced to slackye,

640
00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.070
we could control them.

641
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:04.300
If you will come to me for now Ispy a danger

642
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.600
I do entreat you bring but fiveand twenty.

643
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.070
To no more will I give place ornotice.

644
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:14.470
I gave you all.

645
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.770
And in good time, you gave it.

646
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:18.700
Made you my guardians, mydepositaries,

647
00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.370
But kept a reservation to befollowed

648
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.000
by such a number.

649
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.330
What, must I come to you withfive and twenty, Regan?

650
00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:26.430
Said you so?

651
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.800
And speak't again, my lord.

652
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.430
No more with me.

653
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.770
Those wicked creatures yet dolook more favored

654
00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:39.270
when others are more wicked.

655
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.200
Not being worst stands in somerank of praise.

656
00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.300
I'll go with thee.

657
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.730
Thy fifty yet doth double fiveand twenty,

658
00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:47.800
and thou art twice her love.

659
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.030
Hear me, my lord.

660
00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.770
What need you five and twenty,ten, or five,

661
00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.300
to follow in a house where twiceso many

662
00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.070
have a command to tend you?

663
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.130
What need one?

664
00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.370
O, reason not the need.

665
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:07.500
Our basest beggars are in thepoorest thing superfluous.

666
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.370
Allow not nature more thannature needs,

667
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:13.170
man's life is cheap as beast's.

668
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:14.800
Thou art a lady.

669
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.600
If only to go warm weregorgeous,

670
00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.500
why, nature needs not what thougorgeous wear'st,

671
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.600
which scarcely keeps thee warm.

672
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.770
But for true need

673
00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:25.670
heavens, give me that patience.

674
00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:27.930
Patience, I need!

675
00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.230
You see me here, you gods,

676
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:34.230
a poor old man as full of griefas age,

677
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:35.530
wretched in both.

678
00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:38.330
If it be you that stirs thesedaughters' hearts

679
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.170
against their father,

680
00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:44.130
fool me not so much to bear ittamely.

681
00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:48.600
Touch me with noble anger, andlet not women's weapons,

682
00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.130
water-drops, stain my man'scheeks.

683
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.670
No, you unnatural hags,

684
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.770
I will have such revenges on youboth

685
00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.530
as all the world shall

686
00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.900
I shall do such things

687
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.730
What they are, yet I know not,

688
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:08.670
but they shall be the terrors ofthe Earth.

689
00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.430
You think I'll weep.

690
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.870
No, I'll not weep.

691
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:18.970
I have full cause for weeping,but this heart shall break

692
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:23.000
into a hundred thousand flaws orere I'll weep.

693
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:30.530
O fool, I shall go mad.

694
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.500
Let us withdraw.

695
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.500
'Twill be a storm.

696
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.230
This house is little.

697
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:55.830
The old man and his peoplecannot be well bestowed.

698
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.000
'Tis his own blame hath puthimself from rest

699
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.500
and must needs taste his folly.

700
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.900
For his particular, I'll receivehim gladly

701
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.530
but not one follower.

702
00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:08.400
So am I purposed.

703
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.930
Where is my Lord of Gloucester?

704
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.900
Followed the old man forth.

705
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.900
He is returned.

706
00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.770
The king is in high rage.

707
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:18.100
Whither is he going?

708
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.770
He calls to horse, but will Iknow not whither.

709
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.530
'Tis best to give him way; heleads himself.

710
00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:24.530
Hear me, my lord.

711
00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:27.130
Entreat him by no means to stay.

712
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:28.770
Alas, the night comes on,

713
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.030
and the high winds do sorelyruffle.

714
00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.130
For many miles about, there'sscarce a bush.

715
00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:34.800
O, sir, to willful men,

716
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.730
the injuries that theythemselves procure

717
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:39.030
must be their schoolmasters!

718
00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.430
Shut up your doors.

719
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:44.570
He's tended by a desperatetrain,

720
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:48.500
and what they may incense himto,

721
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.830
being apt to have his earabused,

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.100
My Regan counsels well.

725
00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.770
Come, out of the storm.
