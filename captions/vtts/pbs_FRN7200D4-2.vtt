>> NARRATOR: Tonight on
<i>Frontline...</i>

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.260
>> The job of a reporter is to
be the curmudgeon who raises
questions that nobody else wants
to raise.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.430
That's what the best reporters
try to do.
>> NARRATOR: Once upon a time,
they were thought of as heroes.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.960
But today the entire news
industry is in crisis.
>> The public has a terrific
disdain for the press.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.060
>> We have a press that is at
war with an administration while
our country is at war against
merciless enemies.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.100
>> For 30 or more years, there
had been an assumption about the
government and the press, and
suddenly in the last couple of

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.400
years that's changed.
>> NARRATOR: In a four-part
special series,<i> Frontline</i>
reporter Lowell Bergman looks at

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.860
the challenges facing
journalists today...
>> Would you go to jail to
protect your source?

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.700
>> Absolutely.
>> NARRATOR: ...the war between
the White House and the press...
>> The President of the United

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.430
States saying, "If you publish
this story, you will have blood
on your hands."
>> NARRATOR: ...the explosion of

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.860
new and emerging media...
>> Do you ever feel like the
6:00 news just ain't cutting it
for you?

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.800
>> You don't see anybody between
20 and 30 getting their news
from the evening news.
You see them getting it online.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.400
>> NARRATOR: ...and the economic
realities of today's news
business.
>> You have to make more every

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.800
year to keep the shareholders
happy.
>> NARRATOR: How did we get
here?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.930
>> We're judging journalism by
the same standards that we apply
to entertainment.
That may be one of the greatest

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.500
tragedies in the history of
American journalism.
>> NARRATOR: And what is at
stake?

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:40.900
>> There is a dire need for
institutions that tell the
truth, that pursue the truth,
and that chase it at all cost.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:03:05.000
>> NARRATOR: Tonight, part two
of<i> News War,</i> a<i> Frontline</i> special
series.
>> We're going to start today,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.630
much to the chagrin of the
people across the street, with
the pledge of allegiance.
>> I pledge allegiance to the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:23.400
flag of the United States of
America and to the republic for
which it stands, one nation,
under God, indivisible, with

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:33.030
liberty and justice for all.
(<i> cheers</i> )
>> NARRATOR: Early last July a
group of protestors gathered

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.530
outside the<i> New York Times</i>
office building in midtown
Manhattan.
>> It's no longer the<i> New York</i>

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.060
<i>Times.</i>
It's the<i> Al Jazeera Times.</i>
The<i> Al Jazeera Times!</i>
>> NARRATOR: They were

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.700
protesting the paper's
revelation that the government
was secretly monitoring the
worldwide money-transfer network

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.600
known as SWIFT to track
terrorist financing.
>> Traitor, traitor, traitor!
>> NARRATOR: Fallout from

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.530
the<i> Times</i> story had been roiling
through the media for weeks.
>> This is a US government
secret program in a time of war,

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.830
willfully exposed for no good
reason by the<i> New York Times.</i>
>> I think the<i> New York Times</i>
should start running ads and get

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:16.000
some terror members and have
them say, "I saved my sleeper
cell thanks to the<i> New York</i>
<i>Times."</i>

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.960
>> Pinch Sulzberger and Bill
Keller ought to be frog-marched
out of the<i> New York Times</i>
building.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.000
>> It's time to stop the<i> Times!</i>
It's time to stop the<i> Times!</i>
>> Clearly when we talked about
the SWIFT story we anticipated

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.630
that they would come after us.
I don't know that we anticipated
they'd come out after us quite
as noisily as they did, but we

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.230
expected that it would be
controversial.
controversial.
>> We're at war with a bunch of

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.400
people who want to hurt the
United States of America, and
for people to leak that program
and for a newspaper to publish

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:55.000
it does great harm to the United
States of America.
>> It may seem odd to ordinary
Americans that somebody like me

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.400
has the power to defy the
President of the United States.
>> If you want to figure out
what the terrorists are doing,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.500
you try to follow their money.
And that's exactly what we're
doing.
And the fact that a newspaper

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.530
disclosed it makes it harder to
win this war on terror.
>> But, in fact, that's the way
the inventors of the country set

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:20.360
things up, because the
alternative was to let the
government be the final arbiter
of its own flow of information.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.960
>> NARRATOR: It's the battle
over who controls that flow of
information which is at the
heart of the struggle between

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.160
the Bush administration and the
press.
>> You brought it up.
You said how do I react to a

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.630
bombing that took place
yesterday.
It's precisely what the enemy
understands is possible to do.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:41.860
They're capable of blowing up
innocent life, so it ends up on
your TV show.
>> NARRATOR: Against the

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.200
backdrop of the War on Terror,
the press has clashed repeatedly
with an administration that had
arrived in Washington determined

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:58.000
to change the rules.
(<i> "Hail to the Chief" playing</i> )
>> There was a feeling early on
in this administration that the

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.800
previous administration due to,
you know, scandal after scandal
gave up a lot of executive
power.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.960
And I think that this
administration said, "You know
what?
No way."

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.700
>> NARRATOR: Mark Corallo worked
in John Ashcroft's Justice
Department.
>> There was a definite feeling

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:23.360
that we have got to recapture
the authority that was lost.
We've got to bring this back
into balance.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:30.160
And that's where it's gone.
>> NARRATOR: Ashcroft had been
among the first to signal a
break from the past when he sent

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:38.030
out a memo reversing his
predecessor's policy on
openness.
>> What Ashcroft said is that

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:47.060
the prior policy, which
encouraged disclosure of
information unless some
foreseeable harm would result,

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:53.400
was being overturned in favor of
withholding information whenever
there was a legal basis to do
so.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:04.260
so.
This administration has a track
record of resistance to
disclosure.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:12.430
In the earliest days of the Bush
administration, Vice President
Cheney had his famous Energy
Task Force, in which people

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:19.730
said, "Well, we want to know
more about what's going on
here."
And the Vice President said,

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:28.160
"Absolutely not.
It would have a chilling effect
on the quality of the advice
that I receive if the names of

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:36.430
the people that I talk to were
publicly disclosed."
A few months later, President
Bush issued an executive order

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:46.160
tightening restrictions on
public access to records of past
presidents.
The papers of the Reagan

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:54.960
administration were supposed to
become public in 2001.
This executive order said, "Wait
a minute, those records are not

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:04.100
going to be automatically made
public."
The secrecy predated 9/11 and is
rooted in the President's own

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:15.300
personality and in his governing
philosophy.
>> NARRATOR: The President and
his team had also brought with

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.830
them new ideas about the press.
>> Good morning, thank you.
>> Every president complains
about the press.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.760
>> Cheryl.
Welcome.
We have a couple of newcomers
today.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:31.760
>> But what I think is different
about this administration from
previous administrations is that
the Bush administration does not

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:38.430
accept that the press has a
legitimate public interest role.
>> NARRATOR: Ken Auletta has
covered media for the<i> New Yorker</i>

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:44.960
magazine for over a decade.
>> They view us as a special
interest.
And so when I asked Andrew Card,

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.900
his then Chief of Staff, I said,
"Do you accept that the press
has a legitimate check and
balance function?"

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:56.260
He said, "Absolutely not."
He said, "Congress has a check
and balance function; the
judiciary does, but not the

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:01.630
press."
>> You know, I think Secretary
Card was right.
I mean, I think the true checks

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:07.130
and balances are the judiciary
and the Congress.
You know, the press is not
elected.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:13.560
>> NARRATOR: Mark McKinnon is a
former top media advisor and
close confidante of the
President.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.400
>> The press is going to make
its determinations.
But, you know, who's going to
judge which press outlet is the

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.030
proper check and balance?
>> INTERVIEWER: This
administration had a lot of
discipline in terms of the way

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.800
in which it controlled its
message.
message.
>> Yep.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.730
>> INTERVIEWER: But every
administration has said that at
the beginning.
>> Yep.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:34.160
>> INTERVIEWER: This one really
was very successful keeping
people if you will, on message,
on... in line.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.160
>> That's right.
>> That's right.
>> INTERVIEWER: How?
>> You have a guy at the top who

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.900
knew... knows what he... knows
who he is and what he stands
for.
for.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.460
If we get off message, he lets
us know.
And we have a team of people
that work together a long time.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.960
We know what works and we know
what doesn't.
>> I remember 2004, at one
point, people... you just stood

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.560
up and said, you know, "There's
no way for you to get
reelected."
>> Certainly the relationship

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:03.060
between this administration and
the media is not a good one.
And certainly we believe that
the secrecy has been excessive,

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:10.800
quite excessive.
And it... but at the same time,
you know, their job is to do
their job, and our job is to

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:17.530
find out what's going on.
>> NARRATOR: Leonard Downie is
the executive editor of the
<i>Washington Post.</i>

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:21.400
>> This always happens with the
administrations after they've
been around in Washington for a
while.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:28.330
Personnel begins to change.
Schisms occur within the
administration itself.
Its control over the message

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:35.030
begins to fray.
We're finding out more and more
all the time.
>> NARRATOR: By 2005, with the

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:42.530
war on terror in its fourth
year, more secrets were
beginning to leak from the
government.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:49.360
One of Downie's national
security reporters, Dana Priest,
was learning details about a top
secret CIA program.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:54.160
>> Dana's very, very deeply
sourced throughout the military
and throughout the intelligence
services.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.930
And a number of these sources
were concerned about some of the
policies that the administration
was carrying out in the war

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:09.030
against terrorism.
These are people who, as Dana
describes them, are very much,
you know, very strong proponents

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:13.260
of the war against terrorism.
They're active in the war
against terrorism.
But they're concerned that some

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:18.760
of these methods were
counterproductive.
So for these reasons they would
cooperate with her when she'd

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:24.030
ask questions about things that
added up to some of these
stories.
>> NARRATOR: The stories were

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:32.460
about a system of prisons being
run by the CIA, some of which,
Priest would learn, were housed
in countries in Eastern Europe.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:39.930
>> The existence of the prisons
and the places that they're in
are illegal in the places where
they are.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:45.960
>> INTERVIEWER: It wasn't just
detention in these democracies
in Eastern Europe, it was also
interrogations?

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:54.260
>> The whole reason for having
the detentions in the black
sites was so that the CIA could
interrogate the people in them,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.960
and nobody else-- not the host
nation, nobody.
>> INTERVIEWER: Not the
Pentagon?

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:04.660
>> Not the Pentagon, not the...
>> INTERVIEWER: ...FBI.
>> Nobody, just the CIA
>> INTERVIEWER: Their little...

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:13.360
>> Their little prison system.
>> INTERVIEWER: At a certain
point, the administration knew
what you were doing...

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.160
>> Right.
>> INTERVIEWER: ...on these
detention facilities.
>> Right, I told them.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.700
>> INTERVIEWER: You called them
up?
>> I called them up.
>> I called them up.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:27.400
Whenever there's something that
the reporters obviously see as a
potentially sensitive piece of
information, we will... I will

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:35.330
tell them what it is before I
publish it and ask for a
comment, but also give them a
chance if they want to or if

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:44.030
they feel that it's necessary to
say, you know, that piece of
information would really be
damaging to whatever-- an

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:51.160
ongoing operation, people's
lives, things like that.
>> There came a time when very
senior officials in the

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.660
administration asked to talk to
me along with Dana and her
editors about their questions
about whether or not some of the

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:02.560
things she knows would, in their
minds, harm national security if
we published them.
we published them.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.160
>> INTERVIEWER: Who called you?
>> I can't tell you that,
because I agreed to ground rules
in which they... they would not

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:13.760
be named as people would ask to
talk to me.
They're senior officials of the
government, very senior

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:21.400
officials of the government.
>> NARRATOR: As the Bush
Administration met with the<i> Post</i>
about the CIA prisons story, it

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:28.360
was also having similar
discussions with another paper
over an even more explosive
story.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:35.960
>> President Bush, soon after
9/11, had signed a secret
executive order allowing the NSA
to conduct wire taps on

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:42.530
Americans' international
communications, their emails and
phone calls, if the NSA thought
these communications might be

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:50.900
tied to terrorism or al-Qaeda.
>> NARRATOR: With his colleague
James Risen,<i> New York Times</i>
reporter Eric Lichtblau had been

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:58.330
reporting on this secret
eavesdropping story for over a
year.
>> There was a legal procedure

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:05.230
set in place that's been in
place for 30 years for them to
conduct this kind of
surveillance.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:11.830
>> It was widely understood that
if the government wanted to
listen to your phone calls or
read your emails, and you're

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:18.830
within the United States, they
needed a court order to do that.
>> NARRATOR: The reporters had
uncovered that the President's

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:28.900
executive order had allowed the
NSA-- the National Security
Agency-- to wiretap without any
such court oversight.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:36.600
>> What I tried to struggle with
in writing this story on the NSA
was how do we as a country
really face up to the bounds

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:44.600
between what is a realistic
fight against terrorism versus
the cost of that fight in terms
of giving up our civil

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.760
liberties?
>> INTERVIEWER: Are we
destroying the village in order
to save it?

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:56.200
>> Right.
>> NARRATOR: By December of
2005, the<i> Times</i> was ready to go
with the story, and, as it had

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:04.060
with the<i> Washington Post,</i> the
White House asked for a meeting.
>> The ground rules of the
meeting, which we agreed to,

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:11.430
were that it would be off the
record because the President
wanted to present us with what
he said were classified details

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:15.060
about the effectiveness of the
program that he thought would
persuade us not to publish the
article.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:20.600
article.
I'm obviously going to honor our
obligation not to talk about
anything classified.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:28.030
But the basic fact that the
meeting took place, the White
House has already talked about.
>> NARRATOR: Keller arrived at

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:32.800
the White House with Arthur
Sulzberger, the<i> Times'</i>
publisher, and Philip Taubman,
then the paper's Washington

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:40.900
Bureau Chief.
>> We were escorted into the
Oval Office.
That's my first visit, probably

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:48.760
my last visit to the Bush Oval
Office.
The President said quite
forcefully, that this program

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:55.760
was something he regarded as
part of the crown jewels of our
national security and that if we
exposed it, we should feel

00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:02.030
ourselves responsible if there
was another attack on the US.
I think what he said was, you
know, "When we were called up to

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:11.000
explain to Congress why there
was another attack, you should
be sitting aside... beside us at
the table."

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.030
>> INTERVIEWER: Did you and Mr.
Sulzberger and Phil Taubman,
look at each other?
Did you gulp?

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:18.630
>> Look, you take a warning like
that very seriously indeed.
I mean, it's the President of
the United States saying that if

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:23.500
you publish this story, you will
have blood on your hands.
have blood on your hands.
>> The President said nothing

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.560
like that.
The President did stress the
importance of this program
remaining secret.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:34.000
remaining secret.
This has been one of the most
effective tools in preventing
attacks on our country.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.560
It's one of the most vital tools
that we've had in our arsenal to
defend America.
And the President felt obligated

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.700
if he felt that strongly about
it that he ought to tell the
person who was in charge of that
paper how he felt.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.800
>> INTERVIEWER: But the
reporters involved and the
editors involved say all they
reported on was the question of

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:57.460
the legality of the program, and
that the terrorists, if you
will, know we're listening.
>> Well, they don't know all the

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:05.060
aspects of how we're doing it.
And for you to get into a
conversation about whether it's
legal, there are strong

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:11.400
insinuations about how the
program works.
And the disclosure of such a
program is like putting up a big

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:21.500
billboard to the enemy saying,
"This is how they're defending
their country."
And we think it's wrong.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:26.300
>> The President wrapped it up
by reiterating that he thought
what we were about to do was a
mistake.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.230
>> INTERVIEWER: Would give aid
and comfort to our enemies?
>> Would give aid and comfort to
our enemies, yes.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:37.000
>> INTERVIEWER: That was the
gist of what he said?
>> Uh-huh.
We walked down to the corner to

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.100
catch our taxis in various
directions.
And I said to the publisher that
I wanted to obviously sleep on

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:49.760
it and think about what we just
heard, but I hadn't... my first
impression was I hadn't heard
anything there that had changed

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.800
my mind, and he said he hadn't
either.
>> There are things that I know
that were reported as long ago

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.960
by our reporters as several
decades ago that we've never
published in the newspaper, and
I've never uttered a word about

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.160
because it's clear to me it
would be harmful to national
security.
But at the same time, many times

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.200
that claim is made by the
government simply because they
want to avoid embarrassment.
>> INTERVIEWER: We're at war.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:17.460
The President says we're at war.
>> Yes, he does.
>> INTERVIEWER: So who are you
to decide what's in the interest

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:23.530
of the country, what's national
security and what isn't?
>> Well, decisions about whether
something would be harmful to

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:28.700
national security or not is just
another one of those many
decisions we make about what
we're going to publish or not

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.700
going to publish.
Under our constitutional system,
those decisions cannot be made
by the government.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:36.900
by the government.
That's... that's
unconstitutional, and it also
would be dangerous to our

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:46.100
democracy.
It has to be left to editors and
television producers to make
these decisions.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:53.430
>> If our country is to survive
this wound, let us be more
honest in the pursuit of peace.
>> NARRATOR: The debate over the

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:59.360
right to publish state secrets
goes back to another era when an
unpopular war raged...
>> Never have so many of our

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:04.360
people manifested opposition to
this country's involvement in a
war.
>> (<i> screaming</i> )

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:10.230
>> NARRATOR: ...and the
government and the press were at
odds.
>> We had an agenda we wanted to

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:17.830
implement.
And the principal impediment to
that objective in Vietnam was
the mass demonstrations, given

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:26.300
aid and comfort and support by
the liberal media.
They were standing on our
windpipe.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:34.330
>> NARRATOR: In 1969, Patrick
Buchanan was a speechwriter in
the Nixon White House.
>> The battle between the White

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:42.760
House and the national media is
a battle over who controls the
national agenda.
>> NARRATOR: In 1971, the battle

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:50.300
moved to the front page of the
<i>New York Times</i> when the paper
began running a leaked copy of a
secret Defense Department study.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:58.860
Known as the Pentagon Papers,
the report revealed the
deliberate deceptions that led
the country to war in Vietnam.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:03.800
>> It came out on a Sunday and
on Monday we were doing well.
And then, I think it was a
Tuesday afternoon, I'd checked

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.900
in and said, "Is everything
okay?"
And my boss, who was opposed to
publication, said, "Well, you

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:15.300
better come on over."
>> NARRATOR: James Goodale was
General Counsel for the<i> New York</i>
<i>Times</i> and had urged the paper

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:23.400
to publish the secret documents.
>> So I ran out, hopped in a
cab, shot into the<i> New York</i>
<i>Times,</i> went up to the executive

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:30.760
floor, which is the 14th floor,
and I walked into a room where
there was a huge screaming match
going on.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:37.300
The government had sent a
telegram to the<i> New York Times,</i>
saying stop publication or we're
going to sue you in court the

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:45.060
next day.
>> I thought that publishing the
Pentagon Papers was quasi-
treasonist in war time, yeah.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:52.500
To me it was a clear effort to
sabotage the war effort.
A number of these newspapers,
you know, cheer us into war.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:59.830
And then they... Americans go
into battle and they get killed
in great numbers, and then these
folks tend to undermine.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:06.700
>> NARRATOR: In his telegram,
Nixon's Attorney General cited a
1917 law called the Espionage
Act, which forbids the

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:12.430
publication of national defense
secrets.
>> He said that the
publication-- the ongoing

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:19.900
publication-- by them of
portions of the so-called
Pentagon Papers violated the
Espionage Act.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:25.130
>> INTERVIEWER: Classified
material.
>> Classified material relating
to the national defense, where

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:33.430
national security would be
gravely imperiled.
>> NARRATOR: Floyd Abrams was
hired by Goodale to help

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:40.430
represent the<i> Times</i> after the
paper's corporate counsel
refused to take the case.
>> They had been told by their

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:48.130
lawyers that they would likely
lose, and most of all, from some
sort of moral point of view,
that they were acting

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:55.100
unpatriotically in publishing
the Pentagon Papers.
>> So the issue was do we obey
the government or do we make the

00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:02.900
government come after us?
And that was the subject of this
terrific argument.
>> NARRATOR: Goodale joined in

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:09.460
and then was called to the phone
to talk to the publisher, Arthur
"Punch" Sulzberger, who was on
vacation in Europe.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.900
>> Punch said "Jim, what do you
think we ought to do?"
And I said, "I think you're
going to publish."

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.360
He said, "Well, what about"-- "I
think you should publish"--
think you should publish"--
"What about the criminal

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:23.030
liability?"
I said, "I think that's a...
that's a risk... I think that's
a risk you can... you can take,

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:31.730
and if they stop us, I think we
can win that, too."
can win that, too."
He said, "Okay, go with it."

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:37.060
>> NARRATOR: As it had
threatened, the Nixon
administration went to court and
got an order barring the

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:42.260
newspaper from continuing to
publish.
The paper appealed the decision
and the case moved quickly

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:46.500
through the courts.
>> Constitutional law is an
interesting thing.
It reflects the politics of the

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:52.660
moment.
Vietnam war: terrific public
antipathy toward the
administration and a lot of

00:22:52.660 --> 00:23:00.660
popular support for the<i> New York</i>
<i>Times.</i>
When I went into the courtroom,
people hissed, shouted, they

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:06.630
were crowded.
It was like the Scopes... Scopes
trial, and none in favor of the
government.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:12.930
>> For two and a half weeks, two
constitutional principles have
clashed: the government's view
of our national security versus

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:19.330
the newspapers' view of their
freedom to print.
And the newspapers won.
>> NARRATOR: The Supreme Court

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:26.660
ruled in favor of the<i> Times</i> and
the<i> Washington Post,</i> which had
also published portions of the
Pentagon Papers.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:33.960
>> Well, my reaction was very
simply one of delight and one of
"Now we'll go back to business
as normal, getting out the

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:41.100
<i>Times."</i>
>> NARRATOR: The<i> Times</i> and<i> Post</i>
resumed publishing the Pentagon
Papers the next day.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:46.200
>> It was a very important case
to resist.
to resist.
If they hadn't been willing to

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:53.300
really risk lots, things would
be very different, both legally
and almost culturally, in terms
of the relationship between the

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:59.900
press and the government.
>> Mr. Sulzberger, knowing what
you know now about what
happened, would you do this

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.560
again?
>> Yes, sir, but I'd time my
vacation to Europe slightly
differently.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:11.000
(<i> laughter</i> )
>> We won a near absolute ban on
prior restraints, injunctions
against speech.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.930
>> INTERVIEWER: That still
stands today?
>> That... that still stands.
I mean, if the government had

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:24.160
gone to court to try to prevent
publication of some of the
recent controversial pieces by
the<i> Times,</i> I believe we would

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:31.730
have won because of the Pentagon
Papers case.
But the overhanging question is,
all right, they can't stop you

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:39.460
in advance, can they put you in
jail?
Can they punish you after the
fact?

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:46.530
>> NARRATOR: Four years later
that's exactly what the Ford
White House wondered.
<i>New York Times</i> reporter Seymour

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:53.930
Hersh had exposed details of
highly classified Navy missions
being used to spy on the Soviet
Union.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:25:02.530
Ford's Chief of Staff, Donald
Rumsfeld, and his young deputy,
Dick Cheney, began deliberating
on what to do.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:08.760
In a handwritten memo obtained
by<i> Frontline,</i> Cheney asked what
action they should take "to
enforce the law which prohibits

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:13.060
such disclosure."
>> I was told about it at the
time.
I didn't think it was serious,

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.860
it was more serious.
>> INTERVIEWER: You were told?
>> INTERVIEWER: You were told?
>> I was told at the time,

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:22.630
somebody in Justice warned me
that they were... they were, you
know, they were looking at me.
know, they were looking at me.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:26.600
He wanted people to go into my
house.
They called it my apartment, but
I had a house.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:31.600
>> NARRATOR: In notes from a
meeting with the Attorney
General, they discussed
alternatives for action, from

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:39.100
getting a search warrant to go
after Hersh's papers to seeking
immediate indictments of the<i> New</i>
<i>York Times</i> and Hersh.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:45.830
>> When Cheney and Rumsfeld were
looking at me, the Attorney
General said, "Get out of here."
General said, "Get out of here."

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:49.760
The political cost of moving
against me or people-- I don't
mean that arrogantly, not
about-- moving against somebody

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:57.830
who's prominent in terms of
being a critic is too high.
>> NARRATOR: Prosecuting the
reporter, the Justice Department

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:04.060
warned, "would become a<i> cause</i>
<i>celebre</i> for the press."
>> You can't trample the
Constitution.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:10.030
And if they do, I'm going to
scream and moan and be a hero,
you know, and give more trouble
than they would if they'd just

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:17.900
left me alone, which is the
thing they did in this case.
>> NARRATOR: In the end, no
action was taken against Hersh.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:23.330
>> INTERVIEWER: This situation
today, 35 years later, it just
seems like deja vu all over
again.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:30.230
I mean, the<i> New York Times,</i>
national security-related
stories, the government
reacting.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:41.300
>> Right.
But there are some differences.
One difference is that the press
is not in as good stead with the

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:54.230
American public now as it was in
1971.
Nowadays it's not easy to find a
sort of full-throated supporter

00:26:54.230 --> 00:27:02.760
of the press.
>> NARRATOR: Indeed, last year,
when the<i> Times</i> and<i> Post</i>
published their NSA and CIA

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:09.430
stories, the reaction was
venomous.
>> I can't tell you how upset I
am by this: the fact that an

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:16.200
entire CIA program is outed by
somebody that doesn't like that
program.
>> NARRATOR: Cable talk shows

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:22.860
lit up with condemnation of the
paper's stories.
>> It seems like once again the
anti-Bush<i> New York Times</i> wants

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:28.360
to create a conspiracy where
there is none.
>> NARRATOR: The Bush
administration also took to the

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:33.630
airwaves.
>> It is really a serious
matter, when we get the
disclosure of a program like

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:41.230
this, because, after all, what
we must do is protect from those
who are trying to hurt us.
>> One of the problems we have

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:46.700
as a government is our inability
to keep secrets.
>> We do think it was a fairly
egregious act.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:54.930
egregious act.
It was a very, I'm sure, a
difficult decision for the<i> New</i>
<i>York Times</i> to make.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:28:00.400
I think they made the wrong
decision, and it harmed the
national security interests of
our country.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:07.160
>> It was a shameful act for
someone to disclose this very
important program in a time of
war.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:18.260
>> My first reaction in reading
the NSA story was, "Boy, there's
an excruciating amount of detail
in here," not just about the

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:26.700
program's existence, but about
the actual mechanics of how it
works and what makes it work and
why it functions well in one

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:32.960
case and not in another case.
>> NARRATOR: John Miller has
been on both sides of the divide
between the press and

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:38.230
government.
>> ABC News has learned that the
FBI...
>> NARRATOR: As a reporter at

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:43.060
ABC News, he was one of the last
journalists to interview Osama
bin Laden.
>> We asked bin Laden if Khan

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:49.300
was one of his.
>> NARRATOR: He is now an
assistant director of the FBI.
>> INTERVIEWER: So you didn't

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:55.430
think it was a responsible
story?
>> The standard I use to weigh
things on is, "Is this going to

00:28:55.430 --> 00:29:01.600
be a good story?"
Clearly the NSA was going to be
a good story.
"Is it going to hurt the

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:08.830
government's ability to keep
people safe?"
And, you know, that is where the
debate is in that story.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:16.260
>> NARRATOR: To some in the
intelligence community, it was
the<i> Times'</i> follow-up NSA story
that caused the most concern.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:20.860
>> INTERVIEWER: There was an
article that revealed that there
were switches in phone companies
in the United States...

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.130
>> Right.
>> INTERVIEWER: ...that handled
all of the traffic.
>> Right.

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:27.460
>> INTERVIEWER: And what I had
heard was people were very upset
about the second...
>> Of course.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.230
Of course.
>> INTERVIEWER: ...much more so
than the first.
than the first.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:34.400
>> Of course.
Because the second arti... the
second of the two articles
revealed techniques that were

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:39.500
being used to monitor traffic.
being used to monitor traffic.
Everyone's always talking about
connecting the dots.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:47.460
These are the dots.
And the number of dots we have
to work with has increased
exponentially since 9/11 as a

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:54.930
result of programs like this.
You might get from one of these
programs nothing more than the
name of an individual.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:59.960
You then go to other programs.
You go to a detainee.
You work the system.
And that's what you get from

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:07.200
these programs.
You get fragments, shards of
things that ultimately form a
picture.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:15.700
And to the degree that
terrorists tighten up in their
transactions, their
communication and their

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:21.930
security, you will get fewer of
those things.
>> INTERVIEWER: The follow-up
story in which The<i> New York</i>

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:29.460
<i>Times</i> publishes that the way in
which this eavesdropping is
being done is a data-mining
operation going on through

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:35.600
access to the switches that
telecommunications companies
have here in the United States.
That's something that, while it

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.460
wasn't classified, is something
that terrorists were not aware
of.
>> Well, I don't know whether

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:44.030
terrorists were aware of that or
not.
not.
I... I... I think, you know,

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:50.900
my... my hunch is that
terrorists tend to assume
extraordinary powers, including
extraordinary technological

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:55.000
prowess on the part of the
Americans.
Americans.
And I think they tend to assume

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:04.860
that the American government
uses that power in any way it
can.
>> NARRATOR: But the leadership

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:11.160
of the intelligence community
doesn't agree.
>> The consequences of these
leaks... and happy to have your

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:17.460
question to respond, and I'm
sorry to tell you that the
damage has been very severe to
our capabilities to carry out

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:25.930
our mission.
>> Leaking is a serious issue.
To see the frustration and the
outrage of people expressed

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:35.900
after certain things are leaked
which have severely damaged
operations or collection efforts
or put sources in jeopardy or in

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:43.030
danger, it has been very, very
serious over the years.
>> You go into a highly
confidential briefing on a

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:50.060
classified level, and a few
hours later or the next morning,
the phone rings and somebody
reads it all back to you and

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:58.400
maybe a little more than that.
And you hang up the phone and
say, "How did this get out?
Who takes this oath so casually

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:07.000
that they hand this stuff out?"
>> The people and the sources of
information that Eric Lichtblau
and I got for our story were

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.630
people who, in some cases, were
tortured by their knowledge of
this information.
this information.

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:19.560
They felt compelled to tell this
information, to make the public
aware of it because they
believed that it was either

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:25.760
unconstitutional or illegal, and
I think that they were classic
whistleblowers.
>> INTERVIEWER: You know,

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.960
there's a leak investigation
going on.
They're collecting the names of
reporters who have talked to

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:36.200
officials who had access to this
program.
There's apparently over a score
There's apparently over a score

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:42.260
of agents working out of the
Washington field office.
Is it drying up your sources?
Is it drying up your sources?

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:47.930
>> Well, I'd rather not get into
that in any detail.
I can just say that, you know,
continuing to report and work.

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.760
>> INTERVIEWER: You got
interviewed, right?
>> Yes.
If you were briefed into a

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:58.960
certain program that was leaked,
then there's a possibility that
you could be the leaker.
>> INTERVIEWER: Have they

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.800
interviewed you?
>> I've been interviewed.
>> INTERVIEWER: What did they
ask you?

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:06.160
ask you?
>> They just, you know, they
just wanted to know why these
kinds of leaks happen.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:12.030
>> INTERVIEWER: Today I talked
with a source of mine, who said
he just got polygraphed.
>>

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:16.000
Yeah, that's going on all around
town.
They're investigations of
sources going on all around

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.630
town.
And it's very, very worrying.
And it's very, very worrying.
It's not good.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:25.400
It's not good for the free flow
of information to the public,
and it's not good to criminalize
sources and reporters who are

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:32.760
merely engaged in trying to keep
the American public properly
informed.
>> NARRATOR: So far none of the

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.830
reporters involved in these
national security stories have
been asked to reveal their
sources.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:41.630
>> On the external side, I've
called in the FBI.
>> NARRATOR: But the threat
remains.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:48.630
>> It is my aim and it is my
hope that we will witness a
grand jury investigation with
reporters present being asked to

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:55.700
reveal who is leaking this
information.
I believe the safety of this
nation and the people of this

00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:00.560
country deserve nothing less,
and I thank you for your
question.
>> I thank you, Mr. Director.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:07.430
>> I don't think anybody,
special prosecutor, FBI,
Department of Justice, really
relishes the idea of using a

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:16.400
grand jury or, or a subpoena to
go and have a reporter talk.
But I think it also goes to the
issue that these are serious

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:24.530
matters at times and that
decisions have to be made about
whether or not the need to
protect sources, methods,

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:31.230
operations, intelligence
gathering for the country is...
is paramount.
>> Prosecute the<i> Times!</i>

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:38.260
Prosecute the<i> Times!</i>
Prosecute the<i> Times!</i>
>> NARRATOR: In June 2006, after
the<i> New York Times</i> published its

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:45.900
SWIFT banking story, the
rhetoric grew more heated still.
>> I say, that some anti-Bush
media in America is putting us

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:50.760
all in danger by exposing,
criticizing and undermining just
about everything the
administration does on the war

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:57.330
on terror.
>> There can be no excuse for
anyone entrusted with vital
intelligence to leak it, and no

00:34:57.330 --> 00:35:04.930
excuse for any newspaper to
print it.
>> I don't mean to be too
cynical about the motivations

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:09.860
of, you know, the President and
the Attorney General, but some
of it clearly is political.
I mean, it's not an accident

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:15.900
that a certain number of these
speeches decrying The<i> New York</i>
<i>Times</i> happen to be at the
microphones of Republican fund

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:22.860
raising events.
>> Some in the press, in
particular, the<i> New York Times,</i>
have made the job of defending

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:29.260
against further terrorist
attacks more difficult by
insisting on publishing detailed
information about vital national

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:37.830
security programs.
>> The<i> New York Times</i> is red
meat to a certain slice of the
conservative base.

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:43.930
>> No one elected the<i> New York</i>
<i>Times</i> to do anything, and the
<i>New York Times</i> is putting its
own arrogant, elitist, left-wing

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:49.360
agenda before the interests of
the American people.
>> NARRATOR: But in the days
following the<i> Times'</i> banking

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:56.700
story, Representative Peter King
went beyond mere rhetoric.
He wrote a letter to the
Attorney General, formally

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:03.500
requesting that the<i> Times</i> be
investigated for possible
criminal prosecution under the
Espionage Act-- the same law the

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:11.700
Nixon administration had used in
trying to prevent the
publication of the Pentagon
Papers.

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:17.260
>><i> This week, Attorney General</i>
<i>Alberto Gonzales.</i>
>> NARRATOR: A month earlier,
Attorney General Gonzales had

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:22.600
spoken to the issue of
prosecuting journalists.
>> So you believe journalists
can be prosecuted for publishing

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:29.600
classified information?
>> Well, again, George, it
depends on the circumstances.
There are some statutes on the

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:36.500
books, which if you read the
language carefully, would seem
to indicate that that is a
possibility.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:42.200
>> When he says there are laws
on the books, well people who
know, know there are not many
laws there other than the

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:49.100
Espionage Act.
So, he effectively is saying the
Espionage Act can be used.
>> INTERVIEWER: You know what

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:54.430
the Espionage Act is, right?
>> I'm not a lawyer, but I... I
know what it is.
>> INTERVIEWER: The<i> New York</i>

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:58.530
<i>Times</i> was threatened 35 years
ago.
>> Mm-mm.
>> INTERVIEWER: You think

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:05.330
they're more serious this time?
>> Oh, I don't know.
I don't... I don't know how
serious they are about the

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:10.230
Espionage Act.
Honestly, I don't.
But my instinct is that at this
point they're largely

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:16.460
brandishing the Espionage Act in
hopes that that will make us
nervous and intimidate us.
Maybe intimidate some of our

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:22.030
sources.
>> INTERVIEWER: Should they be
prosecuted?
prosecuted?

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:27.160
>> I'm not going to get into
prosecutorial decisions made by
the Justice Department.
I'm not a lawyer nor would I try

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:32.230
to be.
to be.
But it's an important debate for
the country to have, for the

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:40.760
media and government officials
and others to have who watch
this issue closely because we
are in a new paradigm where the

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:49.200
enemy of our country... enemies
of our country use the very,
technology and comforts of our
lifestyle against us.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:57.030
And this is a healthy debate for
our country.
>> INTERVIEWER: There used to
be, if you will, a de facto

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:01.830
truce between reporters and for
instance, the Justice
Department...
>> Mm-hmm.

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:06.900
>> INTERVIEWER: ...around
confidential sources,
particularly in Washington about
being able to talk without fear

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.160
of retribution.
That's all broken down, hasn't
it?
>> It, it has all broken down,

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:16.600
little by little, because I
think at first, when even the,
the Valerie Plame leak
investigation, I think we still,

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.260
we understood that the ground
was shifting, but didn't
really... couldn't really judge
how much.

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:29.730
how much.
But as time marches on and
they're now potentially looking
at the Espionage Act to use

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:36.200
against people who gather
information rather than people
who give information, the
various leak investigations, and

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:48.060
the effort by the administration
to intimidate, I really do
think, the major media into just
leaving this area.

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:52.300
>> For 30 or more years, there
had been a certain assumption
about the government and the
press, and suddenly in the last

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:56.130
couple of years, that's changed.
The government has been much
more aggressive in going after
the press.

00:38:56.130 --> 00:39:01.730
>> NARRATOR: Phil Bronstein is
the editor of the<i> San Francisco</i>
<i>Chronicle.</i>
Two of his reporters have

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:06.500
recently found themselves in the
news...
>> A showdown.
Lawyers representing two

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:10.400
reporters who won't reveal their
sources...
>> NARRATOR: ...and in legal
jeopardy.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:15.060
>> We've said that we're not
going to betray the sources, and
we mean that.
>> NARRATOR: But this time the

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:26.430
subject is not the war on
terror; it's baseball.
In 2003, authorities raided a
sports nutrition lab called

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:32.200
BALCO, which was suspected of
distributing steroids to
athletes.
>> When you went to the web site

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:36.630
for BALCO, you saw all these
famous athletes that were part
of the company, or that were at
least doing business with the

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:43.900
company.
Barry Bonds was most prominent,
but Marion Jones, Tim
Montgomery, Bill Romanowski...

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:52.030
>> NARRATOR: Mark Fainaru-Wada
and Lance Williams reported on
the BALCO investigation for the
<i>Chronicle</i> as some of the

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:57.300
biggest names in sports began
testifying.
>> Very early on, Mark and I
heard that Bonds had used

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:04.230
steroids, that that was at the
heart of the investigation.
I assumed that that would all
come out when indictments were

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:09.130
issued.
>> Good afternoon.
>> NARRATOR: But it did not.
>> After an 18-month

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:14.500
investigation...
>> NARRATOR: The indictments did
not name any athletes.
>> ...to dozens of athletes.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:20.060
>> NARRATOR: But by the end of
2004, the<i> Chronicle</i> had the
names.
>><i> One of baseball's biggest</i>

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:24.260
<i>stars reportedly admits to</i>
<i>taking banned, illegal</i>
<i>substances.</i>
>> NARRATOR: A confidential

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:28.530
source had leaked the athletes'
grand jury testimony to the
reporters.
>> There's new information

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:34.900
tonight about San Francisco
Giants' slugger Barry Bonds.
>> NARRATOR: The stories
dominated the news.

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:41.700
Bonds had said he used BALCO
products, but never thought they
were steroids.
And Yankees slugger Jason Giambi

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:48.430
had admitted he used steroids.
>> We have a very distinguished
panel here.
>> NARRATOR: In the wake of the

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:55.860
<i>Chronicle</i> reports, Congress
investigated steroid use in
baseball.
>> The final award is the Edgar

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:59.330
A. Poe award.
>> NARRATOR: The reporters were
honored for their work at a
White House Correspondents

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:04.860
dinner.
>> We met the President in 2005.
He knew who we were and he knew
the stories.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:11.160
the stories.
You know, he's a former baseball
owner.
And he said, "You've done a

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:18.900
service."
>> NARRATOR: But not everyone in
the government was pleased with
the<i> Chronicle's</i> reporting.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.600
>> We heard from the government
almost immediately upon
publishing our first story that
had grand jury testimony in it.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.660
>> INTERVIEWER: What did they
say to you?
say to you?
>> Oh, they said, "We understand

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:33.200
you have this information and
we'd like it back and we'd like
to know how you got it."
>> The government wanted to know

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.860
who our sources were.
They wanted all the related
information.
information.

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:41.930
They wanted the packaging it
came in, and so forth.
Anything that would identify the
sources.

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:46.760
>> We, you know, we thought...
talked about it, all of us, and
of course, you know,
respectfully declined.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:56.060
>> I respect the court system,
and I'll, you know, comply with
their wishes in every way
possible, but I am being asked

00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:03.400
to-- not asked, told to-- betray
not only sources, but ideals
that I've held for 30 years as a
reporter.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:08.860
And I'm also being asked to give
up my career because-- don't kid
yourself-- if they bully me into
betraying my sources, I can't

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:14.800
work anymore.
>> I think it's an interesting
notion in journalism that the
professional ethics and

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:24.560
standards require them to
violate the law.
>> NARRATOR: Randall Eliason is
a former federal prosecutor who

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:31.860
has studied the legal standing
of the privilege that reporters
assert to protect their sources.
>> No one has a right to decide

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:37.360
themselves what the law
requires.
I know journalists feel very
strongly that they need this

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:43.030
privilege in order to do their
jobs.
jobs.
Congress hasn't agreed and the

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:48.460
Supreme Court hasn't agreed.
Supreme Court hasn't agreed.
And so journalists have no more
right than any other witness to

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:54.300
say, "I'm just not going to
testify, no matter what you
say."
>> NARRATOR: With the

00:42:54.300 --> 00:43:01.300
journalists refusing to
cooperate, last May the Justice
Department authorized subpoenas
to the<i> Chronicle</i> and its two

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:07.460
reporters, requiring that they
reveal the source of the leaked
grand jury testimony.
>> The Justice Department was

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:15.230
way out of line here.
This was an abuse of power.
>> NARRATOR: Mark Corallo, who
was involved in approving media

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:22.960
subpoenas under Attorney General
Ashcroft, filed an affidavit in
support of the reporters.
>> The government just did not

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:31.000
meet the standards set by their
own guidelines.
The guidelines are very clear: a
media subpoena should only be

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.360
sought when all other avenues of
investigation have been
foreclosed and only in exigent
circumstances.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:42.930
And exigent circumstances were
explained to me to be grave
national security matters...
>> INTERVIEWER: Emergencies.

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:46.330
>> Yeah, emergencies.
>> INTERVIEWER: Life and death.
>> Life and death.
>> INTERVIEWER: What's the

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:49.800
problem here?
Your successor is not a baseball
fan?
>> I don't know.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.730
You know, I don't know what's
happened here.
It seems that there has been a
policy shift.

00:43:53.730 --> 00:44:03.160
It seems that, you know, what...
the way we operated under
Attorney General Ashcroft, where
we were absolutely committed to

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:09.530
not issuing one of these
subpoenas.
That seems to have changed.
>> You know, Mr. Corallo is no

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:16.200
longer at the Justice
Department.
And so, I think he's not aware
of... of all the facts and...

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:23.060
and you know, perhaps
surrounding these cases.
>> NARRATOR: Tasia Scolinos is
Mark Corallo's successor at the

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:30.560
Justice Department and helped
review the media subpoenas in
the BALCO case.
>> NARRATOR: There's no legal

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:38.800
requirement that the department
put special guidelines in place
when it comes to subpoenaing
members of the media.

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.860
Those are self-imposed
guidelines.
We feel that we have a very
serious obligation on behalf of

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:50.060
the taxpayers to prosecute cases
to the fullest extent of the
law.
>> INTERVIEWER: What's the

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:55.660
national security or exigent
circumstances in a case where
the President of the United
States has commended the

00:44:55.660 --> 00:45:00.500
reporting?
reporting?
>> Well, I mean, if you notice,
the guidelines... the guidelines

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:07.030
don't specifically say it has to
be a national security case.
>> INTERVIEWER: Understood.
>> The guidelines, I believe,

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:09.760
say that there needs to be
exigent... exigent
circumstances.
circumstances.

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:17.700
And that can take a lot of
different forms.
>> NARRATOR: The reporters
fought the subpoenas through the

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:24.200
courts, facing up to 18 months
in jail if they lost.
>> You know, we aren't choosing
prison here, by any means.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:33.360
We feel the choice has been made
by the prosecutors and their
demands are just impossible.
>> INTERVIEWER: The

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:36.430
administration has a discretion,
through the Justice Department,
whether or not to bring certain
cases.

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:42.100
And I guess in this particular
case, the question is what's the
rationale?
You're going to shut down

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:47.500
reporting on something which
everyone says has been to the
interests of our public health
and to our youth who are

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:53.330
involved in sports.
>> Well, I think that's
subjective, to say that it would
shut down.

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:59.000
These are tough calls.
We put very seasoned and
experienced prosecutors in these
US attorney positions, to make

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.200
the tough calls.
But ultimately that's why
there's the checks and balances
of a court system.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:07.530
The courts will... will
ultimately vet that out.
>> INTERVIEWER: So we cannot
expect the administration to

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:10.660
back down on that case, to back
off?
>> I speak only for the...
personally for the President.

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:14.630
personally for the President.
We would not in... interject
from the White House into a
criminal prosecution.

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:22.500
criminal prosecution.
The US attorneys involved in
this have broad discretion to
use... to pursue these cases as

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:30.030
they see fit.
>> INTERVIEWER: You're ready to
go to prison?
>> Well, "ready" is a perhaps

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:35.500
not the appropriate word.
But I... prepared, I guess,
although I don't even know if
I'm prepared.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:39.000
Well, we're... if we have to go
to prison for this thing, then
that's, I guess, what's going to
happen.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.560
I don't say that lightly at all.
Neither of us want to go to
jail.
But it's not an option for us to

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:49.900
provide information about
confidential sources.
>> NARRATOR: But in the end, the
reporters did not have to do

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:57.630
either.
In an unexpected twist, just
last week a BALCO lawyer
admitted to leaking the grand

00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:08.000
jury testimony.
The government has agreed to
abandon its effort to put the
two reporters in prison.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:14.900
But 30 miles east of San
Francisco, a reporter has gone
to jail.
Last fall, freelance journalist

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:20.200
and blogger Josh Wolf turned
himself in to the Federal
Correctional Institution in
Dublin, California.

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:26.300
>> Stay strong, man.
>> Here were some of my
supporters.
We all drove out to wish me off,

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:31.930
I suppose.
>> NARRATOR: Wolf was jailed for
refusing to testify in front of
a grand jury and to turn over

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:40.430
video footage that the FBI had
demanded.
No cameras have been allowed to
film with Wolf while he's been

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:47.230
in jail, but<i> Frontline</i> sat down
with him days before his
imprisonment.
>> INTERVIEWER: How did you

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:50.430
first find out that the FBI was
interested in what you may have
shot?
>> I was sitting in my room on

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:58.060
the phone with my mother and
hear the doorbell ring.
Come to get the door and there's
a guy in Bermuda shorts and

00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:03.600
maybe like a Hawaiian button
down shirt and one of those
accordion briefcase things.
And my first thought was, like,

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:08.100
this has to be a reporter.
He was like, "Are you Josh?"
"Yeah."
"Can I talk to you?"

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:14.800
"Sure."
At this point he flashes the FBI
badge just like in the movies.
Opens it up and you're like,

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:25.000
"Oh."
>> NARRATOR: It's outtakes of
this video that the FBI wants.
It's of an anarchist protest in

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:35.700
San Francisco.
Wolf shot it and posted portions
of it on his blog, which covers
political protests.

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:41.400
>> INTERVIEWER: What was the
protest about and what were you
doing there?
>> The protest was facilitated

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:47.130
by a group called Anarchist
Action in solidarity with those
that were marching in
Gleneagles, Scotland, against

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:55.630
the G8 Summit that was going on
at the time.
(<i> chanting</i> )
>> NARRATOR: As Wolf filmed, the

00:48:55.630 --> 00:49:01.930
demonstration grew violent.
>> This is an unpermitted march.
Get out of the street.
You are creating a public safety

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:07.400
hazard, get out of the street.
>> NARRATOR: A police officer
was seriously injured, and the
police would later claim that

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:16.700
some of the protestors tried to
set a police car on fire.
Wolf has made part of his
footage available to local news

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:24.330
and to<i> Frontline.</i>
But it's footage that he has not
released that the FBI wanted,
claiming that his tape could

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:29.930
reveal who allegedly tried to
burn the police car.
>> My concern is that this isn't
about the SFPD police car at

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:37.600
all.
I feel that if I were to open
the flood gates by providing
them a tape to prove that this

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:42.700
subject isn't on it, that I
would then be subject to
questions of, "Who is this
person?

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:48.430
person?
Who is this person?
Who is this person?"
And basically, at that point,

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:54.060
all those people would be
subpoenaed.
And it'd be a never-ending witch
hunt to try to make a database

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:57.960
of civil dissent and people
engaged in... civil dissidence
and people engaged in civil
dissent.

00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:03.200
dissent.
>> It's not really his decision
as to what's important and what
isn't in a federal grand jury

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.060
investigation.
We don't really know what
exactly the government is
looking at in this case.

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:14.130
looking at in this case.
And unless you're involved in
the actual grand jury
investigation, you can't know.

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:21.600
So whether there's some broader
set of allegations that's being
investigated or some broader
kind of conspiracy, only people

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:27.930
involved in the actual
investigation know that.
>> If I were to give those tapes
to them, then I stop being an

00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:34.130
independent journalist and
become, as some of the briefs
say, a de facto investigator for
the government.

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:43.000
There was a trust established
between people involved in the
organization that I was covering
and myself into the fact that

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:49.430
what I chose to release was what
I chose to release, and that I
wasn't an investigator for the
state turning over piles of tape

00:50:49.430 --> 00:51:00.360
for fishing expeditions.
>> NARRATOR: Wolf has already
been in jail for six months.
The judge sentenced him to

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:07.000
remain in custody for the
duration of the grand jury term,
which is due to expire this
July.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:19.530
He has already served longer for
defying a court order than any
journalist in American history.
>><i> We'll take you live now to</i>

00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:25.160
<i>the Justice Department as</i>
<i>Attorney General Alberto</i>
<i>Gonzales briefs reporters on</i>
<i>terror-related indictments...</i>

>><i> Iraqi leaders reportedly</i>
<i>agreed to develop a</i>

>><i> The President strongly</i>

<i>by the CIA and he urges</i>
<i>Congress to grant him legal</i>

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:41.260
<i>authority to try suspects...</i>
>> NARRATOR: The debate around
the national security programs
revealed by the<i> Times</i> and<i> Post</i>

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:47.100
has continued.
>><i> It was possibly the worst-</i>
<i>kept secret around, but today</i>
<i>President Bush finally</i>

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:54.400
<i>admitted it was true...</i>
>> NARRATOR: Last September, the
<i>Post's</i> CIA prisons story was
back in the news...

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.200
>> The President insisted
techniques used on the
detainees...
>> NARRATOR: ...when the

00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:02.330
President confirmed the
detention sites for the first
time.
>> This program has helped us to

00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:10.530
take potential mass murderers
off the streets before they were
able to kill.
>> The media has a hugely

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:17.630
important role during this time
to bring out the things that are
worth debating.
worth debating.

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:24.260
And I think one of the reasons
the government's reacted in the
way that it has is that it's not
allowed that to happen.

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:30.700
allowed that to happen.
>> The feds are trying to kill a
lawsuit over the NSA program to
wiretap without warrants.

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:37.100
>> NARRATOR: The NSA
eavesdropping story has
continued as well.
In August 2006, a federal judge

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:44.460
ruled that the program was
unconstitutional and the Bush
administration is appealing that
decision.

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:51.930
But last month, the
administration agreed to put the
program under court oversight.
>> The only thing we're saying

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:57.030
is this is something the
American people should know
about.
They then can decide whether

00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:03.300
it's something they want to
continue or not.
That's our role.
Our role is not to say to the

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:10.100
American... to the government,
"Don't do this."
Our role is, "This is happening,
you decide."

00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:15.030
>><i> Who do you want or trust to</i>
<i>protect you against terrorists?</i>
<i>The Bush administration or the</i>
<i>committed left media backed by</i>

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:21.660
<i>anonymous leaks?</i>
>> There's merit in the United
States deciding at this point
where does it want to be on this
