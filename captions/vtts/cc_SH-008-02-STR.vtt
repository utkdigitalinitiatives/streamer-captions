00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.830


2
00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.030
Master Fang, have you enteredthe action?

3
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.300
It is entered.

4
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.230
Master Snare, we must arrest SirJohn Falstaff.

5
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.070
I pray you, since my action isentered

6
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.770
and my case so openly known tothe world,

7
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.530
let Sir John be brought in tohis answer.

8
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.270
A hundred mark is a long one fora poor lone woman to bear,

9
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.830
and I have borne and borne andborne

10
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.030
and been fubbed off and fubbedoff and fubbed off

11
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.270
from this day to that day

12
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.070
that it is a shame to be thoughton.

13
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.200
There's no honesty in suchdealing,

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.670
unless a woman should be made anass and a beast

15
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.370
to bear every knave's wrongs.

16
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.430
Yonder he comes,

17
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.800
and that errant, malmsey noseknave, Bardolph, with him.

18
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.930
Do your office.

19
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.730
Do your office, Master Fang.

20
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.770
Do me, do me, do me your office.

21
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.930
How now.

22
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.930
What's the matter?

23
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.400
Whose mare's dead?

24
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.030
Sir John, I arrest you at thesuit of Mistress Quickly.

25
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.370
Away, varlets.

26
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.370
Draw, Bardolph.

27
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.630
Cut me off the villain's head.

28
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.830
Throw the quean in the channel.

29
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.200
Throw me in the channel!

30
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.800
I'll throw thee in the channel.

31
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.800
Wilt thou?

32
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.870
Wilt thou?

33
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.800
Thou bastardly rogue!

34
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.670
Murder, murder!

35
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.500
Ah, thou honeysuckle villain.

36
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.270
Wilt thou kill God's messengersand the king's?

37
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.100
Oh, good people, send a rescueor two.

38
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.430
Wo't thou?

39
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.630
Keep the peace here, ho!

40
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.500
My lord, be good to me.

41
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.630
I beseech you, stand to me.

42
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.470
How now, Sir John.

43
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.870
What are you brawling here?

44
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.470
Doth this become your time, yourplace, and business?

45
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.730
You should have been well onyour way to York.

46
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.570
My most worshipful lord,

47
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.830
an't please Your Grace that I'ma poor widow of Eastcheap,

48
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.930
and he is arrested at my suit.

49
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.670
For what sum?

50
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.330
Well, 'tis more than for some,my lord.

51
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.100
It is for all, all I have.

52
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.200
He has eaten me out of house andhome.

53
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.130
He's put all my substance intothat fat belly of his.

54
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.570
How comes this, Sir John?

55
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.500
Are you not ashamed to enforce apoor widow

56
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.530
to so rough a course to come byher own?

57
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.600
What is the gross sum that I owethee?

58
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.200
If thou wert an honest man,thyself and the money too.

59
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.300
Thou didst swear upon aparcel-gilt goblet,

60
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.970
sitting in my Dolphin chamber atthe round table

61
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.930
before a sea coal fire onWednesday in Wheeson week,

62
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.930
when the prince broke thy headfor liking his father

63
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.200
to a singing man of Windsor,

64
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.400
thou didst swear, as I waswashing thy wound,

65
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.970
to marry me and make me my ladythy wife.

66
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.970
Canst thou deny it?

67
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.130
And didst thou not kiss me

68
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.000
and bid me fetch thee 30shillings?

69
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.400
I put thee now to thy book oath.

70
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.730
Deny it, if thou canst.

71
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.400
My lord, this is a poor, madsoul,

72
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.500
and she says up and down thetown

73
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.770
that her eldest son is like you.

74
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.400
She hath been in good case,

75
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.500
and the truth is, poverty hathdistracted her.

76
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.630
But for these foolish officers,

77
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.170
I beseech you I may have redressagainst them.

78
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.230
Sir John, Sir John, I am wellaware

79
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.730
of your manner of wrenching thetrue cause the false way.

80
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.700
It is not a confident brow northe throng of words,

81
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.630
which come with such more thanimpudent sauciness from you,

82
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.870
can thrust me from a levelconsideration.

83
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.730
You have, so it appears to me,

84
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.030
practiced upon the easy yieldingspirit of this poor woman

85
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.800
and made her serve your usesboth in purse and in person.

86
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.300
Yea, good faith, my lord.

87
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.500
I pray you, peace.

88
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.470
Pay her the debt you owe her

89
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.370
and unpay the villainy you havedone with her.

90
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.400
The one you may do with sterlingmoney

91
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.500
and the other with currentrepentance.

92
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.970
My lord, I will not undergo thissneap without reply.

93
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.870
You call honorable boldnessimpudent sauciness.

94
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.130
If a man will make courtesy andsay nothing, he is virtuous.

95
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.470
No, my good lord.

96
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.300
My humble duty remembered, Iwill not be your suitor.

97
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.430
I say to you that I do

98
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.370
desire deliverance from theseofficers,

99
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.200
being upon hasty employment inthe king's affairs.

100
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.100
You speak as having power to dowrong,

101
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.300
but answer in the effect of yourreputation

102
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.130
and satisfy the poor woman.

103
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.700
Come hither, hostess.

104
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.700
Come hither.

105
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.370
My lord!

106
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.100
Master Gower, what news?

107
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.130
The king, my lord, and Harry,Prince of Wales,

108
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.370
are near at hand.

109
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.170
The rest the paper tells.

110
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.170
No more words on.

111
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.930
Faith, you said so before.

112
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.830
No more words; I'm a gentleman.

113
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.070
No more words on.

114
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.970
By this heavenly ground I treadon,

115
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.300
I will be fain to pawn

116
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.300
both my plate and the tapestriesin my dining chambers.

117
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.000
Let it be ten pound, if thoucanst.

118
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.200
No, no, no, no, no.

119
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.430
An't 'twere not for thy humors,

120
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.670
there's not a better wench inEngland.

121
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.700
Go wash thy face and draw theaction.

122
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.900
Go on.

123
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.270
I pray thee, Sir John, let it bebut 20 noble.

124
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.830
I would be loath to pawn myplate, so God save me.

125
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.830
La!

126
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.830
Let it alone.

127
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.670
I'll make other shift.

128
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:46.830
You'll be a fool still.

129
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.970
Well, you shall have it, and Ipawn my gown.

130
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.430
I hope you'll come to supper.

131
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.830
You will pay me all together?

132
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.000
Will I live?

133
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.170
Go with her, with her.

134
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.200
Hook on; hook on.

135
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.200
Will you have Doll Tearsheetcome meet you to supper?

136
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.070
No more words.

137
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.170
Let's have her.

138
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.900
I have heard better news.

139
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.330
What is the news, my lord?

140
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.430
Where lay the king tonight?

141
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.430
At Basingstoke, my lord.

142
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.430
I hope, my lord, all's well.

143
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.430
What is the news, my lord?

144
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.800
Come all his forces back?

145
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.270
No, 1,500 foot, 500 horse aremarched up

146
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.470
to my lord of Lancaster,

147
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.200
against Northumberland and thearchbishop.

148
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.600
Comes the king back from Wales,my noble lord?

149
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.170
You shall have letters of mepresently.

150
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.830
Come, go along with me, goodMaster Gower.

151
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:29.870
My lord.

152
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.770
What is the matter?

153
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.500
Master Gower, shall I entreatyou to dinner with me?

154
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.430
I must wait upon my good lordhere.

155
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.700
I thank you, good Sir John.

156
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.370
Sir John, you loiter here toolong,

157
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.730
being as you are to takesoldiers up

158
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.970
in counties as you go.

159
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.530
Will you sup with me, MasterGower?

160
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.800
What foolish master taught youthese manners, Sir John?

161
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.500
Master Gower, if they become menot,

162
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.230
he was a fool that taught themme.

163
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.230
This is the right fencing grace,my lord.

164
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.630
Tap for tap, and so part fair.

165
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.770
May the Lord lighten thee.

166
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.700
Thou art a great fool.

167
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.230
Before God, I'm exceeding weary.

168
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.100
Is't come to that?

169
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.500
I had thought weariness durstnot have attached

170
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.930
one of so high blood.

171
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.270
Faith, it does me,

172
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.900
though it discolors thecomplexion of my greatness

173
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.470
to acknowledge it.

174
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.000
Doesn't it show vilely in me todesire small beer?

175
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.930
Why, a prince should not be soloosely studied

176
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.130
as to remember so weak acomposition.

177
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.400
Belike then my appetite was notprincely got.

178
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.700
For, by my troth,

179
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.100
I do now remember the poorcreature, small beer.

180
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.530
Indeed, these humbleconsiderations

181
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.570
make me out of love with mygreatness.

182
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.630
What a disgrace is it to me toremember thy name

183
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.030
or to know thy face tomorrow

184
00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.930
or to take note how many pair ofsilk stockings thou hastó

185
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.430
viz these, and those that werethy peach-colored onesó

186
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.000
or to bear the inventory of thyshirts,

187
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.870
as one for superfluity andanother for use.

188
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.130
But that the tennis court keeperknows better than I,

189
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.670
for it is a low ebb of linenwith thee

190
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.430
when thou keepest not racketthere.

191
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.100
How ill it follows, after youhave labored so hard,

192
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.270
you should talk so idly.

193
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.030
Tell me, how many good, youngprinces would do so,

194
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:30.130
their fathers being so sick asyours at this time is?

195
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.170
Shall I tell thee one thing,Poins?

196
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.670
Yes, faith,

197
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.500
and let it be an excellent, goodthing.

198
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.500
It shall serve among wits of nohigher breeding than thine.

199
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.670
Go to.

200
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.200
I stand the push of your onething you will tell.

201
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.670
Marry, I tell thee,

202
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.000
it is not meet that I should besad, now my father is sick.

203
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.430
Albeit I could tell to thee, asto one it pleases me,

204
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.070
for fault of a better, to callmy friend,

205
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.030
I could be sad,

206
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.600
and sad indeed too.

207
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.870
Very hardly upon such a subject.

208
00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.200
By this hand, thou thinkest me

209
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.270
as far in devil's book as thouand Falstaff

210
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.770
for obduracy and persistency.

211
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.070
Let the end try the man.

212
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.200
I tell thee, my heart bleedsinwardly,

213
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.300
my father is so sick.

214
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.270
And keeping such vile company asthou art

215
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.600
hath in reason taken from me allostentation of sorrow.

216
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.230
The reason?

217
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.700
What wouldst thou think of me ifI should weep?

218
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.430
Why, I would think thee a mostprincely hypocrite.

219
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.270
It would be every man's thought,

220
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.430
and thou art a blessed fellow tothink so as every man thinks.

221
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:34.200
Never a man's thought in theworld

222
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.970
keeps the roadway better thanthine.

223
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.300
Every man would think me ahypocrite indeed.

224
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.070
And what accites your mostworshipful thought to think so?

225
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:49.100
Why, because you have been solewd and engrafted to Falstaff.

226
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.670
And to thee.

227
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.700
By this light, I am well spokeon.

228
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.130
I can hear it with my own ears.

229
00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.670
The worst they can say of me isthat I am a second brother

230
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.530
and that I am a proper fellow ofmy hands.

231
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:07.930
And those two things, I confess,I cannot help.

232
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.500
God save Your Grace.

233
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.000
And yours, most noble Bardolph.

234
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.200
How doth thy master?

235
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.430
Well, my lord,

236
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:25.430
he hath heard of Your Gracecoming to town.

237
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:26.430
There's a letter for you.

238
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.000
Delivered with good respect.

239
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.770
And how doth the martlemas, yourmaster?

240
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.670
In bodily health, sir.

241
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.100
Marry, the immortal part needs aphysician,

242
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.700
but that moves not him.

243
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.100
Though that be sick, it diesnot.

244
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.570
I do allow this wen to be

245
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.330
as familiar with me as my dog.

246
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.670
And he holds his place, for lookyou how be writes.

247
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.370
"Sir John Falstaff, knight,

248
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.970

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:54.970

greeting."

251
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.130
Why, this is a certificate.

252
00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.430
Peace.

253
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.030
"I will imitate the honorableRomans in brevityó"

254
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.470
He sure means brevity in breath,short-winded.

255
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:09.100
"I commend me to thee, I commendthee, and I leave thee.

256
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.300

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.570
"Repent at idle times as thoumayest.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.170
"And so farewell.

"Thine by yea and by no,

262
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.770

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.730

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.430
"John with my brothers andsisters,

and Sir John with all Europe."

266
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.830
My lord, I'll steep this letterin sack and make him eat it.

267
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.030
That's to make him eat 20 of hiswords.

268
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.830
Do you use me thus, Ned?

269
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.200
Must I marry your sister?

270
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.200
God send the wench no worsefortune.

271
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.300
But I never said so.

272
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.870
Well, thus we play the foolswith the time,

273
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.570
and the spirits of the wise sitin the clouds and mock us.

274
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.230
Is thou master here in town?

275
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:03.300
Oh, yea, my lord.

276
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.470
Where sups he?

277
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.700
Doth the old boar feed at theold frank?

278
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.970
At the old place, my lord, inEastcheap.

279
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.130
What company?

280
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.400
Ephesians, my lord, of the oldchurch.

281
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.430
Sup any women with him?

282
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:16.700
None, my lord,

283
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.370
but old Mistress Quickly andMistress Doll Tearsheet.

284
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:20.870
What pagan may that be?

285
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.430
A proper gentlewoman, sir, and akinswoman of my master's.

286
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.400
Even such kin as the parishheifers are to the town bull.

287
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.000
Shall we steal upon them, Ned,at supper?

288
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.370
I am your shadow, my lord.

289
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.930
I'll follow you.

290
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.670
Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph,

291
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.100
no word to your master that I amyet come to town.

292
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.470
Here's for your silence.

293
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.430
I have no tongue, sir.

294
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.770
And for mine, I will govern it.

295
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:46.770
Fare you well.

296
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:47.770
Go.

297
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.170
This Doll Tearsheet should besome road.

298
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.070
I warrant you, as common as theroad

299
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.530
between Saint Alban's andLondon.

300
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.170
How might we see Falstaff bestowhimself tonight

301
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:02.330
in his true colors, and notourselves be seen?

302
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:07.170
Put on two leathern jerkins andaprons,

303
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:09.970
and wait upon his table asdrawers.

304
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.770
From a god to a bull?

305
00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.400
A heavy descension.

306
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.900
It was Jove's case.

307
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.800
From a prince to a prentice?

308
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.030
A low transformation.

309
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.470
That shall be mine,

310
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.630
for in everything the purposemust weigh with the folly.

311
00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:27.670
Follow me, Ned.

312
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.300
I pray thee, loving wife andgentle daughter,

313
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.230
give even way unto my roughaffairs.

314
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.070
Put not you on the visage of thetimes

315
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.700
and be like them to Percytroublesome.

316
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.300
I have given over.

317
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.870
I will speak no more.

318
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:41.970
Do what you will.

319
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.400
Your wisdom be your guide.

320
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.700
Alas, sweet wife, my honor is atpawn,

321
00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.770
and, but my going, nothing canredeem it.

322
00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:52.370
Oh, yet, for God's sake, go notto these wars.

323
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.000
The time was, Father, that youbroke your word,

324
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.670
when you were more endeared toit than now,

325
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.730
when your own Percy,

326
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.300
when my heart's dear Harry,

327
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.100
threw many a northward look tosee his father

328
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.970
bring up his powers.

329
00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.930
But he did long in vain.

330
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.470
Who then persuaded you to stayat home?

331
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.600
There were two honors lost,yours and your son's.

332
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:36.800
For yours, may the God of heavenbrighten it.

333
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.830
For his, it stuck upon him

334
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.700
as the sun in the gray vault ofheaven,

335
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:49.270
and by his light did all thechivalry of England

336
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.930
move to do brave acts.

337
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.370
He was indeed the glass

338
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.030
wherein the noble youth diddress themselves.

339
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:03.470
He had no legs that practicednot his gait.

340
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:10.430
And speaking thick, which naturemade his blemish,

341
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:14.330
became the accents of thevaliant;

342
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:18.000
for those that could speak lowand tardily

343
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.130
would turn their own perfectionsto abuse,

344
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.800
to seem like him.

345
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:33.270
So that in speech, in gait, indiet, in affections of delight,

346
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.630
in military rules, humors ofblood,

347
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:41.970
he was the mark and glass, copyand book,

348
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.730
that fashioned others.

349
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.270
And himó

350
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:54.000
oh, wondrous him,

351
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.100
oh, miracle of menó

352
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:03.230
him did you leave,

353
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:08.530
second to none, unseconded byyou,

354
00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:14.370
to look upon the hideous god ofwar in disadvantage,

355
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:19.970
to abide a field where nothingbut the sound of Hotspur's name

356
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.930
did seem defensible.

357
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.170
So you left him.

358
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:33.870
Never, oh, never, do his ghostthe wrong

359
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:37.470
to hold your honor more preciseand nice

360
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.870
with others than with him.

361
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:46.330
Let them alone.

362
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.970
The marshal and the archbishopare strong.

363
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:59.900
Had my sweet Harry had but halftheir numbers,

364
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:04.000
today might I, hanging onHotspur's neck,

365
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.630
have talked of Monmouth's grave.

366
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.870
Beshrew your heart.

367
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.900
Fair daughter, you do draw myspirits from me

368
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:18.100
with new lamenting ancientoversights.

369
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.770
But I must go and meet withdanger there,

370
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.430
or it will seek me in anotherplace

371
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.000
and find me worse provided.

372
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.230
Oh, fly to Scotland,

373
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.930
till that the nobles and thearmed commons

374
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:34.770
have of their puissance made alittle taste.

375
00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.630
If they get ground and vantageof the king,

376
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:41.830
then join you with them, like arib of steel,

377
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.800
to make strength stronger.

378
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:50.830
But, for all our loves, firstlet them try themselves.

379
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.300
So did your son.

380
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.700
He was so suffered.

381
00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.330
So came I a widow

382
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:04.630
and never shall have length oflife enough

383
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:08.900
to rain upon remembrance withmine eyes,

384
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:14.430
that it may grow and sprout ashigh as heaven,

385
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.030
for recordation to my noblehusband.

386
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:21.130
'Tis with my mind as with thetide swelled up unto his height

387
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.030
that makes a stillstand, runningneither way.

388
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.670
Fain would I go to meet thearchbishop,

389
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.430
but many thousand reasons holdme back.

390
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:34.930
I will resolve for Scotland.

391
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:39.230
There am I till time and vantagecrave my company.

392
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.270
I' faith, sweetheart,

393
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.530
methinks now you are in anexcellent good temperality.

394
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.370
Your pulsidge beats asextraordinarily

395
00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:53.500
as heart would desire,

396
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.670
and your color, I warrant you,

397
00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.300
it's as red as any rose, in goodtruth, la!

398
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.100
But by faith, you have drunk toomuch canaries,

399
00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.600
and that's a marvelous searchingwine,

400
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.870
and it perfumes the blood ereone can say "What's this?"

401
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.570
How do you now?

402
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.270
Better than I was.

403
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.800
Why, that's well said, a goodheart's worth gold.

404
00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.070
Lo, here comes Sir John.

405
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.470
When Arthur first in courtó

406
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:21.800
empty the jordan.

407
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.000
How now, Mistress Doll.

408
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.570
Sick of a calm; yea, good faith.

409
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:28.130
So is all her sect.

410
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.530
An they be once in a calm, theyare sick.

411
00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:31.900
A pox, damn you.

412
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.330
You muddy rascal.

413
00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.830
Is that all the comfort you giveme?

414
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.430
You make fat rascals, MistressDoll.

415
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:40.670
I make them?

416
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.000
Gluttony and diseases make them.

417
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.200
I make them not.

418
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.970
If the cook help to make thegluttony,

419
00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.130
you help to make the diseases,Mistress Doll.

420
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.800
We catch of you, Doll; we catchof you.

421
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.130
Grant that, my poor virtue;grant that.

422
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.500
Hang yourself, you muddy conger.

423
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.930
Hang yourself.

424
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.500
By my troth, this is the oldfashion.

425
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.200
You two never meet but you fallto some discord.

426
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.830
You are both, in good faith, asrheumatic as two dry toasts.

427
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.770
You cannot one won bear withanother's confirmities.

428
00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:13.670
What the goodyear.

429
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.770
One must bear, and that must beyou.

430
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:20.930
You are the weaker vessel, asthey say, the emptier vessel.

431
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:26.630
Can a weak, empty vessel bearsuch a huge, full hogshead?

432
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.500
There's a whole merchant'svessel

433
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.430
of Bourdeaux stuff in him.

434
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.770
You have not seen a hulk betterstuffed in the hold.

435
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:41.730
Come, I'll be friends with thee,Jack.

436
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.130
Thou art going to the wars.

437
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.770
And whether I shall ever seethee again or no,

438
00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.100
there is nobody cares.

439
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.330
Sir, ancient Pistol is below andwould speak with you.

440
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.430
Hang him, swaggering rascal.

441
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:56.730
Let him not come hither.

442
00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.130
It is the foul-mouthed'st roguein England.

443
00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.830
If he swagger, let him not comehere.

444
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.430
No, by my troth.

445
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.230
I must live among my neighbors.

446
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.770
I'll no swaggerers.

447
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:08.670
I am in good name and fame withthe very best.

448
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:09.830
Shut the door.

449
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:12.030
There comes no swaggerers here.

450
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.600
I have not lived all this whileto have swaggering now.

451
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.630
Shut the door, I pray you.

452
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.100
Dost thou hear, hostess?

453
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.200
Pray you, pacify yourself, SirJohn.

454
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.400
There comes no swaggerers here.

455
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.470
Dost thou hear?

456
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:23.770
It is mine ancient.

457
00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:25.330
Tilly-fally, Sir John.

458
00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:29.070
Your ancient swaggerer comes notin my doors.

459
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.500
I was before Master Tisick, thedeputy, t'other day,

460
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.930
and, as he said to me,

461
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.370
'twas no longer ago thanWednesday last, by my faith.

462
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.530
"Neighbor Quickly," says he.

463
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.830
Master Dumbe, our minister, wasby then.

464
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.200
"Neighbor Quickly," says he,

465
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.500
"Receive those that are civil,

466
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.900
"for," said he, "you are in anill name."

467
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.770
Now a' said so, I can tellwhereupon.

468
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:52.930
"For," said he,

469
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.170
"You are an honest woman andwell thought of.

470
00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:57.770
"Therefore take heed what guestsyou receive.

471
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:59.930
Receive no swaggeringcompanions."

472
00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:01.230
There comes none here.

473
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.930
You would bless you to hear whathe said.

474
00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.500
No, I'll no swaggerers.

475
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.930
He's no swaggerer.

476
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.030
A tame cheater, i' faith.

477
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:11.330
You may stroke him as gentle asa puppy greyhound.

478
00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.700
Call him up, Bardolph.

479
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.370
Cheater, call you him?

480
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:18.770
I will bar no honest man myhouse, nor no cheater,

481
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.230
but I do not love swaggering.

482
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.100
I am the worse, when one saysswagger.

483
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.700
Feel, masters, how I shake.

484
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.070
Oh, look you, I warrant you.

485
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:29.400
So you do, hostess.

486
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.770
Do I?

487
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:33.570
Yea, in good faith, do I, an'twere an aspen leaf.

488
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.470
Oh, I cannot abide swaggerers.

489
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:37.730
God save you, Sir John.

490
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:38.870
Welcome, ancient Pistol.

491
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:40.770
Pistol, I charge you with a cupof sack.

492
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.700

I will discharge her, Sir John,with two bullets.

494
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.600
She's Pistol-proof, sir.

495
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.730
You shall not hardly offend her.

496
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.400
Come, I'll drink no proofs norno bullets.

497

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:06.070
I scorn you, scurvy companion.

By this wine, I'll thrust myknife into your moldy chaps

an you play the saucy cuttlewith me.

511
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.070
Away, you bottle ale rascal.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:50.000
God's light, with two points onyour shoulders?

515

God's my life, I will murder herruff for this.

517
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.400

518
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.400
I would not have you go offhere.

519
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.970
Discharge yourself of ourcompany, Pistol.

520
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.170
No, Captain Pistol; not here,sweet captain.

521
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:05.970
Captain?

522
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.400
Thou abominable damned cheater,

523
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.500
art thou not ashamed to becalled captain?

524
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:15.400
An captains were of my mind,they would truncheon you out

525
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.630
for taking their names upon youbefore you earned them.

526
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.300
You a captain?

527
00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.070
You slave, for what?

528
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:26.130
For tearing a poor whore's ruffin a bawdy house?

529
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.800
He a captain.

530
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.900
Hang him, rogue.

531
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.170
He lives upon moldy stewedprunes and dried cakes.

532
00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:37.570
A captain.

533
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.800
Therefore captains had need lookto it.

534
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.630
Hark thee hither, Mistress Doll.

535
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:42.630

Well, IóI tell thee, CorporalBardolph,

539
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.270
I shall tear her.

540
00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:50.770
I'll be revenged of her.

541
00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:52.830
Good Captain Pistol, be quiet.

542
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:54.130
'Tis very late.

543
00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.770
I beseech you, aggravate yourcholer.

544
00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.030
These be good humors, indeed.

545
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.730
Shall packhorses and hollowpampered jades of Asia

546
00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:05.100
that cannot go up 30 mile a day,

547
00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.300
compare with Caesar and withcannibals and Trojan Greeks?

548
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.730
Nay, rather damn them with KingCerberus,

549
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.370
and let the welkin roar.

550
00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:15.270
Shall we fall foul for toys?

551
00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:20.630
By my troth, captain, these arebitter words.

552
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:25.100
Then feed and be fat, my fairCalipolis.

553
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.970
Come, give's some sack.

554
00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:34.370
"Si fortune me tormente, speratome contento."

555
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:35.370
Pray thee, go down.

556
00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:36.370
Go down.

557
00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.600
Fear we broadsides?

558
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.230
No, the fiend give fire.

559
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:47.300
Sweetheart, lie thou there.

560
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.500
What?

561
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.700
We come to full points here, andare etceteras nothing?

562
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.170
Pistol, I would be quiet.

563
00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.600
Sweet knight, I kiss thy neaf.

564
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.630
What, we have seen the sevenstars.

565
00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.870
For God's sake, thrust himdownstairs.

566
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:03.700
I cannot endure such a fustianrascal.

567
00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.300
Thrust me down stairs?

568
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.930
Quoit him down, Bardolph, like ashovegroat shilling.

569
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.670
This will grow to a brawl anon.

570
00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:12.600
Pray you downstairs.

571
00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.030
Shall we have incision?

572
00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.030
Shall we imbrue?

573
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:17.330
Then death rock me asleep.

574
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.100
Abridge my doleful days.

575
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.100
Why, then, let grievous,ghastly, gaping wounds

576
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.800
untwine the Sisters Three.

577
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.700
Come, Atropos, I say.

578
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.500
This is goodly stuff toward.

579
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.100
Boy, give me my rapier.

580
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.100
I pray thee, Jack.

581
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.000
I pray thee, do not draw.

582
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Get you downstairs.

583
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.900
I'll forswear housekeeping

584
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.800
afore I'll be in these terretsand frights.

585
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:48.130
I pray you, Jack, be quiet.

586
00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.600
The rascal's gone.

587
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:54.870
Ah, you whoreson, little valiantvillain, you.

588
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.670
Are you not hurt i' the groin?

589
00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.630
Methought a' made a shrewdthrust at your belly.

590
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.200
Have you thrust him out o'doors?

591
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.970
Aye, Sir John.

592
00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:04.570
The rascal's drunk.

593
00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.100
You hurt him, sir, in theshoulder.

594
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.370
A rascal to brave me.

595
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:11.500
You sweet little rogue, you.

596
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.470
Alas, poor ape, how thou sweats.

597
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.300
Come, let me wipe thy face.

598
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.900
Come on, you whoreson chops.

599
00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:30.570
I' faith, I love thee.

600
00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.470
Thou art as valorous as Hectorof Troy,

601
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:35.570
worth five of Agamemnon,

602
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:37.970
and ten times better than theNine Worthies.

603
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.270
Ah, villain.

604
00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.370
A rascally slave.

605
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.100
I'll toss the rogue in ablanket.

606
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.400
Do, an thou darest for thyheart.

607
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.900
An thou dost, I'll canvass theebetween a pair of sheets.

608
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.900
The music is come, sir.

609
00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.270
What?

610
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.270
The music is come.

611
00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:53.330
Well, let them play.

612
00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:54.530
Play, sirs.

613
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.730
Come sit on my knee, Doll.

614
00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.630
A rascal bragging slave.

615
00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.430
The rogue fled from me likequicksilver.

616
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:03.500
I' faith,

617
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:08.930
and thou followedst him likechurch.

618
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:14.600
You whoreson, little, tidyBartholomew boar pig,

619
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:19.330
when wilt thou leave fighting o'days and foining o' nights,

620
00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:23.870
and begin to patch up thine oldbody for heaven?

621
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.300
Peace, good Doll,

622
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.730
do not speak like adeath's-head.

623
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.900
Do not bid me remember mine end.

624
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.470
Sirrah, what humor's the princeof?

625
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.670
A good, shallow young fellow

626
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:45.900
who would have made a goodpantler,

627
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.500
would ha' chipped bread well.

628
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.670
They say that Poins has a goodwit.

629
00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.430
He a good wit?

630
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:53.670
Hang him, baboon.

631
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.630
His wit's as thick as Tewksburymustard.

632
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.370
Why does the prince love him so,then?

633
00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:59.870
Because their legs are both of abigness

634
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:04.300
and a' plays at quoits well andswears with a good grace

635
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.130
and such other gambol facultiesa' has

636
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:09.530
that show a weak mind and anable body.

637
00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:12.500
For the prince himself is suchanother.

638
00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.770
The weight of a hair

639
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.600
will turn the scales betweentheir avoirdupois.

640
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.770
Would not this nave of a wheelhave his ears cut off?

641
00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:23.830
Let's beat him before his whore.

642
00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.870
Look, whether withered elder

643
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:30.900
hath not his poll clawed like aparrot.

644
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.730
Is it not strange that desire

645
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.330
should so many years outliveperformance?

646
00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.630
Kiss me, Doll.

647
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.570
Saturn and Venus this year inconjunction.

648
00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:47.170
What says the almanac to that?

649
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.300
Thou dost give me flatteringbusses.

650
00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:58.030
By my troth, I kiss thee with amost constant heart.

651
00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:00.670
I am old.

652
00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.570
I am old.

653
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.830
I love thee better

654
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:10.470
than I love e'er a scurvy youngboy of them all.

655
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.930
What stuff wilt have a kirtleof?

656
00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.430
I shall receive money o'Thursday.

657
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:21.130
Shall have a cap tomorrow.

658
00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.900
A merry song, come.

659
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.970
It grows late.

660
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.330
We'll to bed.

661
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.170
Thou'lt forget me when I amgone.

662
00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:36.270
By my troth,

663
00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:39.800
thou sets me a-weeping, an thousayest so.

664
00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.330
Prove that ever I dress myselfhandsome till thy return.

665
00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.770
Well, harken at the end.

666
00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:50.030
Some sack, Francis.

667
00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:51.330
Anon, anon, sir.

668
00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.600
A bastard son of the king's.

669
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.670
And art not thou Poins, hisbrother?

670
00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:00.970
Why, thou globe of sinfulcontinents,

671
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:02.730
what a life dost thou lead.

672
00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:03.830
A better than thou.

673
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:05.130
I'm a gentleman; thou art adrawer.

674
00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:06.170
Very true, sir,

675
00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:08.470
and I come to draw you out bythe ears.

676
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.830
Oh, the Lord bless that sweetface of thine.

677
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:13.730
Oh, Jesu, are you come fromWales?

678
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:16.570
Thou whoreson mad compound ofmajesty,

679
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.830
by this light flesh and corruptblood, thou art welcome.

680
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:20.600
Hold, you fat fool.

681
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.870
I scorn you.

682
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.670
My lord, he will drive you outof your revenge

683
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:28.430
and turn all to a merriment, ifyou take not the heat.

684
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.670
You whoreson candle-mine, you.

685
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:32.830
How vilely did you speak of meeven now

686
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:37.930
before this honest, virtuous,civil gentlewoman.

687
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:41.930
Oh, now, God's blessing on yourgood heart.

688
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:43.370
So she is, by my troth.

689
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:44.370
Didst thou hear me?

690
00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:47.970
Yea, and you knew me,

691
00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:51.670
as you did when you ran away byGadshill.

692
00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:52.930
You knew I was at your back

693
00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.500
and spoke it on purpose to trymy patience.

694
00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.300
No, no, no; not so.

695
00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.430
No, I did not think thou wastwithin hearing.

696
00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:02.300
I shall drive thee then toconfess the willful abuse,

697
00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.730
and then I know how to handleyou.

698
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:05.300
No abuse, Hal.

699
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.830
On mine honor, no abuse.

700
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:08.430
Not to dispraise me

701
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:10.800
and call me pantler and breadchipper

702
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.030
and I know not what.

703
00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.170
No abuse, Hal.

704
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.200
No abuse?

705
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.300
No abuse, Ned, i' the world.

706
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.830
No, no, none.

707
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:21.370
No, I dispraised him before thewicked

708
00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.730
that the wicked might not fallin love with thee,

709
00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.500
in which doing, I have done thepart

710
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.270
of a careful friend and a truesubject,

711
00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:29.570
and thy father is to give methanks for it.

712
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:31.300
No abuse, Hal.

713
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.300
None, Ned, none.

714
00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.900
No, faith, boys, none.

715
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.370
See now, whether pure fear orentire cowardice

716
00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:40.200
doth not make thee wrong thisvirtuous gentlewoman

717
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.730
to close with us?

718
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:44.100
Is she of the wicked?

719
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.770
Is thine hostess here of thewicked

720
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.730
or thy boy of the wicked

721
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:49.900
or honest Bardolph,

722
00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.070
whose zeal burns in his nose, ofthe wicked?

723
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.270
Answer, thou dead elm; answer.

724
00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:58.470
The fiend hath pricked downBardolph irrecoverable,

725
00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:01.070
and his face is Lucifer's privykitchen,

726
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:04.170
where he does nothing but roastmaltworms.

727
00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:08.300
For the boy, well, there's agood angel about him,

728
00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.300
but the devil outbids him too.

729
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.770
For the women?

730
00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:13.600
For one of them, she's in hellalready

731
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.170
and burns poor souls.

732
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.770
For the other, I owe her money,

733
00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:21.630
and whether she be damned forthat, I know not.

734
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.230
No, I warrant.

735
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.330
Who knocks so loud at door?

736
00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:28.330
Peto.

737
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:29.330
My lord!

738
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:30.230
How now, Peto.

739
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:31.370
What's the news?

740
00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:32.970
The king your father is atWestminster,

741
00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:34.930
and there are 20 weak andwearied posts

742
00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:36.800
come from the north.

743
00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.930
And as I came along, I met andovertook a dozen captains,

744
00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.370
bareheaded, sweating, knockingat the taverns,

745
00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.100
and asking everyone for Sir JohnFalstaff.

746
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:48.500
By heaven, Poins, I very much toblame,

747
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.430
so idly to profane the precioustime.

748
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:53.470
Give me my sword and cloak.

749
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:55.930
Falstaff, good night.

750
00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:03.000
Oh, now, now comes in thesweetest morsel of the night,

751
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.070
and we must hence and leave itunpicked.

752
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:07.100
Oh, more knocking.

753
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.100
How now.

754
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.100
What's the matter?

755
00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.300
You must to court presently.

756
00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:13.900
A dozen captains stay at doorfor you.

757
00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:14.900
Farewell, hostess.

758
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.400
Farewell, Doll.

759
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.630
You see, my good wenches, howmen of merit are sought after.

760
00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:22.370
The undeserver may sleep whenthe man of action is called on.

761
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:23.830
Farewell.

762
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:28.270
If I be not sent away post, Iwill see you again ere I go.

763
00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:29.770
I cannot speak.

764
00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:32.600
If my heart be not ready toburstó

765
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.200

766
00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.370

771
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.200
