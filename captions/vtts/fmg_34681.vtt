WEBVTT

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
"I HAVE KNOWN THE JOY AND
 PAIN OF DEEP FRIENDSHIP

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I HAVE SERVED
 AND BEEN SERVED

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I HAVE MADE SOME
 GOOD ENEMIES

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
FOR WHICH I AM
 NOT A BIT SORRY.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I HAVE LOVED UNSELFISHLY,
 AND I HAVE FONDLED HATRED

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
WITH THE RED HOT
 TONGS OF HELL -

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
THAT'S LIVING."

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
ZORA NEALE HURSTON WAS
BORN JANUARY 7TH, 1891,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
THE FIFTH OF
EIGHT CHILDREN.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
HER FATHER,
JOHN HURSTON,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
WAS A CARPENTER AND
BAPTIST PREACHER;

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
HER MOTHER, LUCY
POTTS HURSTON,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
A FORMER
SCHOOLTEACHER.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
FROM ZORA'S EARLIEST
YEARS, SHE STOOD APART

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
FROM HER SIBLINGS
AND PEERS.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
ONCE, UPON HEARING THAT
SHE WANTED A HORSE

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
FOR CHRISTMAS, HER
FATHER EXCLAIMED

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
"I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GOT
IN THIS FAMILY NO HOW!"

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
AND ANGRILY
OFFERED THAT SHE

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
WASN'T LIKE THE
REST OF HIS CHILDREN.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
ZORA WAS TOLD EARLY
IN HER LIFE IN WORDS

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
AND IN ACTION THAT SHE
WAS DIFFERENT FROM

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS,
AND THAT HELPED TO

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
REINFORCE HER MAINTAINING
HER DIFFERENCE.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
SHE WAS DIFFERENT THAN
HER OTHER SISTER, SARAH,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
IN THAT SHE WAS NOT A GOOD
LITTLE, EYES TO THE FLOOR,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
YES SIR, NO SIR, BLACK
DAUGHTER OF A SOUTHERN

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
MINISTER, THAT SHE
HAD NO PROBLEM DEFYING

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
WHAT WAS
EXPECTED OF HER.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
SHE PLAYED ACROSS
GENDER TYPES IN THAT

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
SHE RAN WITH
HER BROTHERS.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
THEY WERE RESPECTFULLY
SCARED OF HER BECAUSE

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
SHE COULD KEEP UP WITH
THEM AND THAT SHE WAS

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
NOT INTIMIDATED BY THEM,
AND THAT SHE DID NOT

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
HAVE A PROBLEM LIVING
OUTSIDE OF BEING A GIRL,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
A SOUTHERN GIRL.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
HER FATHER REMAINED
PERPLEXED BY

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
HIS YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
FOR ALL OF HIS LIFE.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
JOHN HURSTON WAS PASTOR
OF THE ZION HOPE

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
BAPTIST CHURCH IN
EATONVILLE, FLORIDA,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
WHERE HE'D EARNED
THE NICKNAME

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
"GOD'S BATTLE AXE"
FOR HIS BOOMING VOICE

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
AND GRAND GESTURES
FROM THE PULPIT.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
HE WAS AN EXCELLENT
PROVIDER, BUT ALSO

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
AN UNREPENTANT
LADIES' MAN.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN HIS
INFIDELITIES THAT WOULD

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
SO INFLUENCE ZORA IN HER
OWN ADULT RELATIONSHIPS.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
SHE NEVER UNDERSTOOD
HER MOTHER'S DEVOTION

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
TO THE MAN, AND
WOULD NEVER HERSELF

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
FORM A LASTING
RELATIONSHIP.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
ZORA'S FATHER WAS CONSIDERED
QUITE THE WOMANIZER

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
AND I THINK THAT THE
MODEL THIS SET UP FOR ZORA

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
WAS THAT SHE WAS NOT
GOING TO POSITION HERSELF

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
TO BE HURT, THAT SHE
WAS NOT GOING TO BE

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
PEGGED INTO LIMITATIONS
ON RELATIONSHIPS,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
AND THAT SHE COULD
FLOW WITH, MOVE WITH,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
WHATEVER MADE
HER HAPPY.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
SO IF AT SOME POINT
IN THE RELATIONSHIP

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
IT WASN'T WORKING,
SHE DIDN'T FEEL

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
THAT IT WAS HER
RESPONSIBILITY

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
TO BE A MARTYR AND
TO STICK WITH IT,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
AND THAT IF IT WASN'T
PLEASING TO HER,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
AND IF IT TRULY WAS NOT
SHOWING FORWARD PROGRESS,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
THAT SHE HAD NO PROBLEM
RELEASING HERSELF FROM

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
THAT RELATIONSHIP AND
MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ONE.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
EATONVILLE WAS AN
IDYLLIC TOWN FOR ITS DAY.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
THICK GROVES OF ORANGE
AND GRAPEFRUIT TREES HUNG

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
HEAVY WITH FRUIT - NOT AN
UNUSUAL SIGHT IN FLORIDA,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
BUT THE TOWN WAS UNIQUE
IN ONE IMPORTANT WAY:

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
IT WAS THE FIRST CHARTERED
ALL-NEGRO TOWN IN AMERICA,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
FOUNDED BY BLACKS,
SETTLED BY BLACKS

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
AND GOVERNED BY BLACKS.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
ZORA'S FATHER SERVED
THREE TERMS AS ITS MAYOR.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
AND SO, SURROUNDED BY
PEOPLE WHO LOOKED LIKE HER

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
AND TALKED LIKE HER,
IN A TOWN FREE OF

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION,
ZORA GREW UP WITH A SENSE

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
OF SECURITY UNKNOWN TO
MOST AFRICAN-AMERICANS

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
IN THAT AGE OF JIM CROW
AND LYNCHINGS.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
IT BECAME A TEMPLATE ON
HER ABOUT HOW NORMAL

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
SHE WAS, AND HOW ALL
THOSE THINGS THAT WERE

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
CULTURALLY BLACK
WERE JUST ROUTINE,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
THEY WEREN'T JUXTAPOSED
AGAINST, OR COMPARED TO,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
OR RANKED AGAINST THOSE
THINGS THAT WERE WHITE.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
SO LIVING IN THAT
ENVIRONMENT SHE SAW

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
EVERYTHING AROUND HER THAT
REPRESENTED NORMAL LIFE

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
AND JUST HAPPENED
TO BE ALL BLACK.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
THE GOOD THING ABOUT THAT
IS THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
A DENTED OR DAMAGED PSYCHE
BY COMPARING IT TO,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
OR BEING LESS THAN, OR BEING
SUBORDINATE OF THE BLACK

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
BACKSIDE OF A WHITE TOWN,
AND THAT EVERYTHING

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
YOU DO WINDS UP BEING
A SEPARATE BUT EQUAL,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
SEPARATE BUT DIFFERENT,
SEPARATE BUT REALLY NOT

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
EQUAL RELATIONSHIP TO THOSE
THINGS THAT ARE WHITE.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
THE NURTURING
ENVIRONMENT OF EATONVILLE

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
PROVIDED HER WITH
A SENSE OF SELF

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
THAT SERVED HER WELL
IN LATER YEARS.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
"ONCE I FOUND THE
 USE OF MY FEET,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
THEY TOOK TO WANDERING.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I ALWAYS WANTED TO GO.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I WOULD WANDER OFF
 IN THE WOODS ALL ALONE,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
FOLLOWING SOME INSIDE
 URGE TO GO PLACES.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
THIS ALARMED MY
 MOTHER A GREAT DEAL.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
SHE USED TO SAY THAT SHE
 BELIEVED A WOMAN WHO WAS

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
AN ENEMY OF HERS HAD
 SPRINKLED "TRAVEL DUST"

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
AROUND THE DOORSTEP
 THE DAY I WAS BORN.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
THAT WAS THE ONLY
 EXPLANATION SHE COULD FIND."

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
ZORA WAS ACCEPTED TO
HOWARD UNIVERSITY IN 1919,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
AND IT WAS THERE THAT
HER TALENTS AS A WRITER

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
WERE FIRST RECOGNIZED.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
HER SHORT STORY "JOHN
REDDING GOES TO SEA"

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
WAS PUBLISHED IN 1921
IN 'THE STYLUS',

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
THE CAMPUS LITERARY
SOCIETY'S MAGAZINE.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
BUT RECOGNITION
CAME FROM NOT JUST

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
THE HOWARD
UNIVERSITY LITERATI.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
ALAIN LOCKE WAS
A HARVARD PH.D.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
AND THE FIRST BLACK
MAN EVER TO ATTEND

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
OXFORD UNIVERSITY ON
A RHODES SCHOLARSHIP.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
IN THE 1920'S HE DIVIDED
HIS TIME BETWEEN TEACHING

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
DUTIES AT HOWARD AND A
BUSY LIFE IN HARLEM

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
WHERE HE SERVED AS
A SORT OF UNOFFICIAL

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
"PRESS AGENT" FOR THE
EMERGING LITERARY SCENE.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
HE COUNTED LANGSTON HUGHES
AND POET COUNTEE CULLEN

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
AMONG HIS FRIENDS,
AND WHEN HE READ

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
"JOHN REDDING GOES
TO SEA" IN 1924,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
LOCKE BECAME A FAN
OF HURSTON AS WELL.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
HE RECOMMENDED
ZORA'S WORK

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
TO PUBLISHER
CHARLES S. JOHNSON.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
THE PREVIOUS YEAR
JOHNSON HAD LAUNCHED

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
THE PERIODICAL "OPPORTUNITY:
A JOURNAL OF NEGRO LIFE"

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
AND IN ITS DECEMBER 1924
ISSUE READERS FOUND

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
"DRENCHED IN LIGHT",
THE WORK THAT PLACED

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
ZORA NEALE HURSTON'S
NAME AND HER TALENT

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
FIRMLY IN THE
NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
IN ZORA'S MIND,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
SHE WAS NOW A WRITER.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
IN JANUARY 1925, AT
THE URGING OF JOHNSON,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
HURSTON MOVED
TO NEW YORK CITY.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
HARLEM SOON
FELT LIKE HOME.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
MUCH LIKE THE EATONVILLE
OF HER YOUTH, THE HARLEM

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
OF THE 1920'S WAS A PLACE
WHERE AFRICAN-AMERICANS

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
COULD CELEBRATE AND REVEL
IN THEIR OWN CULTURE.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
THE NEXT YEAR SHE
ENTERED FOUR WORKS

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
IN A LITERARY CONTEST
SPONSORED BY "OPPORTUNITY".

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
THERE RE MORE THAN
SEVEN HUNDRED SUBMISSIONS;

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
HUGHES WAS REPRESENTED,
SO WAS CULLEN.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
BUT WHEN THE AWARDS WERE
GIVEN OUT AT A GALA EVENT

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
ON MAY 1ST 1926, ZORA
HURSTON TOOK HOME

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
MORE PRIZES THAN ANYONE
ELSE: SECOND PLACE IN THE

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
FICTION CATEGORY FOR
HER SHORT STORY "SPUNK",

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
SECOND AMONG THE DRAMA
ENTRIES FOR "COLOR STRUCK",

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
AND HONORABLE MENTION
FOR HER PLAY "SPEARS",

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
AND HER SHORT
STORY "BLACK DEATH".

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.000
HERS WAS A FRESH, NEW VOICE
ADDRESSING TIMELESS TOPICS.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
THE GREAT THEMES OF
THE NOVEL, AS SCHOLARS

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
HAVE SAID FOR YEARS,
ARE LOVE AND DEATH.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
HURSTON WRITES ABOUT
LOVE AND DEATH,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
THAT'S WHAT
SHE WRITES ABOUT.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
THE TWO FUNDAMENTAL CONCERNS
OF BEING A HUMAN BEING.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
NOT DEATH FROM THE
LYNCH MOB, BUT DEATH...

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
JUST FACING THE ABYSS.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHO YOU LOVE?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
PEOPLE FALLING IN
AND OUT OF LOVE.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
SHE WRITES ABOUT PASSION,
SHE WRITES ABOUT

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
THE ABSENCE OF PASSION
METAPHORICALLY:

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
"THE SPIRIT OF THE
BEDROOM GOT UP

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
AND MOVED TO
THE PARLOR."

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I MEAN, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL
WAY TO TALK ABOUT

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
THAT MOMENT IN
A RELATIONSHIP

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
WHEN PASSION DISAPPEARS.
WE HADN'T SEEN THAT

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN
LITERATURE BEFORE.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
SO IMPRESSIVE WAS HER
WORK THAT BARNARD COLLEGE

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
FOUNDER AND BENEFACTOR
ANNIE NATHAN MEYER,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
ATTENDING THE AWARDS
BANQUET, OFFERED HER

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
A CHANCE TO ENROLL
AT THE COLLEGE.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
ZORA COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN
A BETTER HOME THAN HARLEM

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
NOR A BETTER
TIME TO BE THERE.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
THE NEW NEGRO MOVEMENT HAD
BEGUN, FUELED BY A MASSIVE

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
MIGRATION OF SOUTHERN
BLACKS TO THE NORTH.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
BLACK LITERATURE, ART,
AND MUSIC FLOURISHED.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
THIS MAGICAL PERIOD SOON
CAME TO BE KNOWN AS THE

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
HARLEM RENAISSANCE, AND IT
USHERED IN ONE OF THE MOST

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
EXCITING TIMES IN THE
HISTORY OF AMERICAN CULTURE.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
HURSTON SOON FOUND HERSELF
WORKING AND PLAYING AMONG

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST
LIGHTS IN BLACK LITERATURE

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
- LANGSTON HUGHES, COUNTEE
CULLEN, AND ALAIN LOCKE.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
STARS OF STAGE, SCREEN
AND SONG AS WELL -

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
PAUL ROBESON, BESSIE SMITH,
LOUIS ARMSTRONG

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
AND ETHEL WATERS -
TO NAME JUST A FEW.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
IN THE 1920'S HARLEM WAS
THE PLACE TO SEE AND BE SEEN.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
FOR BLACKS, IT
WAS A UNIQUE SPOT

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
CENTER-STAGE IN A NEW
AGE OF AMERICAN CULTURE,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
AND FOR WHITES
WHO REGULARLY

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
MADE THE TREK UPTOWN,
IT WAS A PLAYGROUND.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
NOTABLES SUCH AS CHARLIE
CHAPLIN, WILLIAM FAULKNER,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
TALLULAH BANKHEAD,
JIMMY DURANTE,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
AND GEORGE GERSHWIN
FREQUENTED ITS CLUB SCENE.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
ALL WERE DRAWN BY HARLEM'S
GROWING REPUTATION AS A

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
PLACE WHERE THE JAZZ WAS
HOT, A REEFER WAS "COOL",

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000
AND THE BEHAVIOR
WAS UNINHIBITED.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
THOUGH STILL FINDING
HER VOICE AS A WRITER,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
ZORA HAD ALREADY SHOWN
A REMARKABLE ABILITY

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
TO OBSERVE, TO ABSORB,
TO STUDY THE VERY REAL

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
CHARACTERS WHO SURROUNDED
HER, AND TO TRANSFORM THEM

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
INTO BELIEVABLE FICTIONAL
CHARACTERS ON THE PAGE.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
IT WAS ONLY NATURAL THAT,
WHEN SHE ENROLLED IN

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
BARNARD COLLEGE IN 1925,
THESE INTERESTS AND

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
TALENTS GUIDED HER TOWARD
THE STUDY OF ANTHROPOLOGY.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
BARNARD WAS THE SISTER
COLLEGE OF NEW YORK'S

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
PRESTIGIOUS COLUMBIA
UNIVERSITY, AND IT WAS

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
AT COLUMBIA THAT
THE GERMAN EMIGRE,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
FRANZ BOAS, HAD
ESTABLISHED THE VERY FIRST

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000
DEPARTMENT OF
ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE U.S.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
EVERYTHING THAT SHE DID
THROUGHOUT HER LIFE

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
WAS PRETTY MUCH SHAPED BY
THE FACT THAT SHE WAS

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
AN ANTHROPOLOGIST.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
AND YOU CAN FIND
THREADS OF THAT CLEARLY

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
AND BROADLY IN THE
NOVELS AND FOLKTALES

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
AND SHORT STORIES AND
COLLECTIONS THAT SHE DID.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I THINK ZORA WAS ALMOST
BORN AN ANTHROPOLOGIST

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
AND HAD TO FIND HER WAY
AS A SOCIAL SCIENTIST

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
AND REALIZED THAT
IS WHAT SHE WAS

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
AND THEN SHE
TRAINED IN IT.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
BUT SHE ALWAYS HAD AN
UNCANNY NATURE TO JUST

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
BE AN OBSERVER, TO
STAND BACK AND WATCH

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
SOCIAL LIFE HAPPEN AROUND
HER IN SMALL GROUPS.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
IN 1926 ZORA BEGAN DOING
FIELD WORK FOR FRANZ BOAS

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
IN HARLEM.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
BOAS'S WORK INVOLVED
THE STUDY OF HUMAN BODY

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
MEASUREMENTS FOR ITS
USE IN ANTHROPOLOGICAL

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
CLASSIFICATION
AND COMPARISON -

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
A FIELD KNOWN
AS "ANTHROPOMETRY".

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
ZORA THOUGHT
NOTHING OF STOPPING

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
COMPLETE STRANGERS ON
THE STREETS OF HARLEM

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
AND MEASURING THEIR
SKULLS FOR HER RESEARCH.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
AND ALL THIS TIME SHE
WAS STUDYING, OBSERVING,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
SHE WAS WRITING.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
BEFORE THE 1920'S,
AFRICAN-AMERICAN ARTISTS

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
WERE EXPECTED TO CREATE
WORKS THAT MADE NOT JUST

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
AN ARTISTIC STATEMENT,
BUT A SOCIAL AND POLITICAL

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
ONE AS WELL, WORKS THAT
WOULD LIFT UP THE RACE

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
BY DEPICTING BLACKS
WHO SPOKE PROPERLY,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
WHO BEHAVED PROPERLY,
WHO WERE EDUCATED.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
PERHAPS NO ONE PROMOTED
THIS NARROW VIEW

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
OF ARTISTIC LICENSE
MORE THAN W.E.B. DUBOIS,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
WHO BLUNTLY STATED
"I DO NOT CARE A DAMN

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
FOR ANY ART THAT IS NOT
USED FOR PROPAGANDA".

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
THE WRITERS OF THE HARLEM
RENAISSANCE REJECTED THIS

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
EARLY VERSION OF WHAT
TODAY MIGHT BE CALLED

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
"POLITICAL CORRECTNESS",
AND IN THE SUMMER OF 1926,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
HURSTON, LANGSTON HUGHES,
WALLACE THURMAN AND OTHERS

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
RESPONDED WITH A NEW
PUBLICATION THAT REFLECTED

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
WHAT THEY BELIEVED BLACK
LITERARY ART SHOULD BE.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
THEY CALLED IT "FIRE!",
AND IT BRIMMED AND BURNED

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
WITH WORKS INTENDED,
IN HUGHES' WORDS,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
TO "CAUSE THE SMUG NEGRO
MIDDLE CLASS TO TURN FROM

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
THEIR WHITE, RESPECTABLE,
ORDINARY BOOKS AND PAPERS

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
TO CATCH A GLIMMER
OF THEIR OWN BEAUTY".

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
IT WAS A BOLD STATEMENT
OF ARTISTIC INTENT -

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
PERHAPS TOO MUCH SO,
EVEN FOR THAT BOLD TIME.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:28.000
THEY PUBLISHED ONLY ONE
ISSUE, IN NOVEMBER 1926.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
THE FOLLOWING FEBRUARY,
THROUGH THE EFFORTS

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
OF FRANZ BOAS, HURSTON
RECEIVED A FELLOWSHIP

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
GRANT TO COLLECT NEGRO
FOLKLORE IN THE SOUTH.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
HER JOURNEYS THROUGH A LAND
WHERE LYNCHING WAS COMMON

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
AND RACISM RAMPANT,
SERVED TO SHOW HER

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
JUST HOW UNCOMMON HER
UPBRINGING HAD BEEN

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
IN THE IDYLLIC
ALL-BLACK EATONVILLE.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
FOR A TIME SHE TRAVELED
WITH LANGSTON HUGHES,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
WHOM SHE HAD RUN INTO BY
CHANCE IN MOBILE, ALABAMA.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
ALONG THE WAY SHE
COLLECTED A TREASURE TROVE

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
OF STORIES, FOLK TALES,
AND SONGS SUNG BY SLAVES

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
AND THEIR DESCENDENTS
IN THE AMERICAN SOUTH.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
* MAMA DON'T WANT NO PEAS,
 NO RICE, NO COCONUT OIL

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
NO COCONUT OIL. MAMA DON'T
 WANT NO PEAS, NO RICE,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
NO COCONUT OIL,
 NO COCONUT OIL.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
MAMA DON'T WANT NO PEAS,
 NO RICE, NO COCONUT OIL...

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000
ALL SHE WANT IS WHISKEY
 BRANDY ALL THE TIME. *

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
SHE SPENT SIX MONTHS
ON THE EXPEDITION

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
WITH ONE MAJOR DIVERSION
TO ST. AUGUSTINE, FLORIDA

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
IN MAY OF THAT YEAR TO
MARRY HERBERT SHEEN,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
AN OLD BOYFRIEND FROM HER
HOWARD UNIVERSITY DAYS.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
SHEEN RETURNED TO RUSH
MEDICAL COLLEGE IN CHICAGO

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
WHILE HURSTON PURSUED
HER OWN INTERESTS

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
BOTH IN NEW YORK AND
"IN THE FIELD" AND SO

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
PERHAPS THE MARRIAGE WAS
DOOMED FROM THE START.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
THEY BROKE OFF RELATIONS
THE FOLLOWING JANUARY,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
THOUGH THE COUPLE
REMAINED MARRIED

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
FOR THREE MORE YEARS.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
SUBSEQUENT TRIPS SOUTH
TO COLLECT FOLKLORE

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
WERE SUBSIDIZED BY A
WEALTHY WHITE PATRON,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
MRS. RUFUS OSGOOD MASON.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
LANGSTON HUGHES
HAD INTRODUCED THEM

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
TO ONE ANOTHER.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
IN 1930, HURSTON BEGAN
ORGANIZING THE FIELD NOTES

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY
BECOME HER HIGHLY-PRAISED

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
"MULES AND MEN".

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
IN NEW ORLEANS, HURSTON
BECAME FASCINATED

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
WITH THE PRACTICE
OF HOODOO.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
KNOWN VARIOUSLY AS
"VOODOO", "CONJURE"

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
AND "OBEAH", HOODOO HAS
ITS ROOTS IN AFRICA,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
BUT IT FLOWERED
IN THE NEW WORLD,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
A MELDING OF AGE-OLD
SPIRIT WORSHIP,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
AND CATHOLICISM'S
PANTHEON OF SAINTS.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
SHE IMMERSED HERSELF IN
ITS STUDY, APPRENTICING

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
WITH SOME OF NEW ORLEANS'
MOST REVERED AND FEARED

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
"HOODOO DOCTORS,"
AND EVEN ENDURING

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
SOMETIMES-FRIGHTENING
INITIATION RITES.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
"ON THE SECOND DAY I
 BEGAN TO DREAM STRANGE,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
EXALTED DREAMS.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
ON THE THIRD NIGHT I HAD
 DREAMS THAT SEEMED REAL

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
FOR WEEKS.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
IN ONE, I STRODE
 ACROSS THE HEAVENS

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
WITH LIGHTNING
 FLASHING UNDER MY FEET,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
AND GRUMBLING THUNDER
 FOLLOWING IN MY WAKE."

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
SHE PUBLISHED MUCH OF
HER RESEARCH IN THE

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
JOURNAL OF
AMERICAN FOLKLORE

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
AS "HOODOO IN
AMERICA" IN 1931.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
HER INTEREST AND
INVOLVEMENT IN HOODOO

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
WENT BEYOND THE
MERELY ACADEMIC.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
SHE FULLY BELIEVED
IN ITS POWER,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
AND WAS ABSORBED
IN ITS MYSTERY.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
HOODOO WOULD REMAIN A
LIFE-LONG FASCINATION AND,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
IN THE YEARS TO COME, HER
STUDIES OF ITS PRACTICE

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
WOULD TAKE HER ACROSS
THE AMERICAN SOUTH

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
AND TO THE CARIBBEAN.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000
1931 WITNESSED CHANGES IN
TWO OF ZORA NEALE HURSTON'S

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
MOST SIGNIFICANT
RELATIONSHIPS.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
SHE FINALLY DIVORCED
HERBERT SHEEN WHO HAD

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
MET ANOTHER WOMAN AND
WANTED TO RE-MARRY.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
THE TWO HAD BEEN LIVING
APART FOR SOME THREE YEARS

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
BUT HURSTON WOULD PROFESS
TO HIM YEARS LATER

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
THAT SHE STILL
LOVED HIM DEEPLY.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
MORE SIGNIFICANT
WAS HURSTON'S BREAK

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
WITH LANGSTON HUGHES.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
IN 1930, THE TWO BEGAN
COLLABORATING ON A PLAY

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
BASED ON ZORA'S SHORT STORY
"THE BONE OF CONTENTION".

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
THE PLAY
WAS ENTITLED

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
"MULE BONE: A
COMEDY OF NEGRO LIFE"

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
AND WAS INTENDED TO
COUNTER THE SORT OF

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
GRIM PORTRAIT OF
AFRICAN-AMERICAN LIFE

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
SO PREVALENT
IN ITS DAY.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
ODDLY FOR TWO SUCH
DISTINCTIVE WRITERS,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
IT WAS NOT ARTISTIC
DIFFERENCES THAT

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
FOMENTED THE RIFT,
BUT FINANCIAL ONES.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
HUGHES PROPOSED SPLITTING
PROFITS OF THE PLAY WITH

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
THEIR TYPIST - NEITHER
HUGHES NOR HURSTON

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
COULD AFFORD TO PAY
THE WOMAN IN CASH -

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
AND WHAT STARTED AS
A PETTY DISAGREEMENT

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
SOON GREW INTO A
FIRST-RATE ROW.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
IN FEBRUARY 1931, HURSTON
ABANDONED THE PLAY AND

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
HEADED SOUTH ONCE MORE
TO CONTINUE COLLECTING

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
FOLKLORE FOR
"MULES AND MEN".

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
IN 1932, WITH THE
DEPRESSION TAKING

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
ITS AWFUL TOLL AND
JOBS AND MONEY SCARCE,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
HURSTON FOUND HERSELF
BACK IN EATONVILLE.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
SHE HAD FINALLY BROKEN
HER TIES WITH THE

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
WEALTHY PATRON SHE
CALLED "GODMOTHER".

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
MRS. RUFUS OSGOOD
MASON HAD BECOME

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
AS MUCH HINDRANCE AS HELP,
INSISTING ON GUIDING

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
HURSTON'S DEVELOPMENT
IN THE DIRECTION

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
SHE THOUGHT A BLACK
WRITER'S PATH SHOULD TAKE.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
NOW, FREE OF ANY FINANCIAL
OBLIGATION TO MASON,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
HURSTON FELT A NEW
SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
THAT FED HER
CREATIVITY.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
AFTER "THE GILDED SIX
BITS" WAS PUBLISHED

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
IN THE LITERARY
MAGAZINE "STORY",

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
HURSTON RECEIVED LETTERS
FROM FOUR PUBLISHERS,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
INCLUDING BERTRAM
LIPPINCOTT

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
OF THE J.B.
LIPPINCOTT COMPANY,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
ALL EAGER TO READ ANY
LONGER WORKS OF FICTION

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
SHE MIGHT
HAVE TO OFFER.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
SHE ANSWERED WITH A WHITE
LIE, TELLING LIPPINCOTT

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
THAT SHE WAS WRITING A
NOVEL, AND A WEEK LATER

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:28.000
SHE BEGAN WORK ON
"JONAH'S GOURD VINE".

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:35.000
"WHAT I WANTED TO TELL
 WAS A STORY ABOUT A MAN,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
AND FROM WHAT I HAD READ
 AND HEARD, NEGROES WERE

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
SUPPOSED TO WRITE
 ABOUT THE RACE PROBLEM.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
I WAS AND AM THOROUGHLY
 SICK OF THE SUBJECT.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
MY INTEREST LIES IN WHAT
 MAKES A MAN OR A WOMAN

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
DO SUCH AND SO,
 REGARDLESS OF HIS COLOR."

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
A FICTIONALIZED ACCOUNT
OF HER FATHER'S LIFE,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
THE BOOK CAME TOGETHER IN
JUST THREE MONTHS, AND

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
REPRESENTED TWO MILESTONES
IN HURSTON'S LIFE.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
IT ALLOWED HER TO
FINALLY WORK THROUGH

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
THE TANGLE OF
FEELINGS THAT SHE HAD

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
FOR HER POWERFUL,
PHILANDERING FATHER,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
AND WITH ITS ACCEPTANCE
FOR PUBLICATION BY THE

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
LIPPINCOTT COMPANY,
IT MADE HURSTON

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
A RARE ENTITY IN
DEPRESSION ERA AMERICA:

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
A BLACK, FEMALE
PUBLISHED NOVELIST.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
IN MARCH 1936,
HURSTON WAS AWARDED

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
A PRESTIGIOUS
GUGGENHEIM FELLOWSHIP

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
TO STUDY WEST INDIAN
OBEAH PRACTICES.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
THAT YEAR HER STUDIES
TOOK HER TO JAMAICA,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
THEN TO HAITI THE
FOLLOWING YEAR.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
IT WAS WHILE ENGAGED IN HER
FIELD WORK IN HAITI THAT

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
HURSTON WROTE WHAT WOULD
BE HER MOST-LOVED WORK,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
"THEIR EYES WERE
WATCHING GOD".

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
IT CAME TOGETHER AT A
FEVER PITCH, TAKING JUST

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
SEVEN WEEKS TO COMPLETE,
HER WRITING SHARING TIME

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
WITH HER
ANTHROPOLOGICAL STUDIES.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
"THEIR EYES WERE
WATCHING GOD"

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:09.000
WAS PUBLISHED ON
SEPTEMBER 18TH, 1936.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
"SHIPS AT A DISTANCE HAVE
 EVERY MAN'S WISH ON BOARD.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
FOR SOME THEY COME
 IN WITH THE TIDE.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
FOR OTHERS THEY SAIL
 FOREVER ON THE HORIZON,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
NEVER OUT OF SIGHT,
 NEVER LANDING UNTIL

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
THE WATCHER TURNS HIS
 EYES AWAY IN RESIGNATION,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
HIS DREAMS MOCKED
 TO DEATH BY TIME.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
THAT IS THE LIFE OF MEN."

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
TODAY, ITS PUBLICATION IS
SEEN AS A WATERSHED MOMENT

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN
LETTERS.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
ITS LEAD
CHARACTER, JANIE,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
OF A TYPE UNSEEN,
PERHAPS EVEN UNIMAGINED,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:56.000
IN ANYTHING THAT
HAD COME BEFORE.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
IF YOU READ AFRICAN-AMERICAN
LITERATURE UP TO THIS TIME

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
YOU DON'T THINK BLACK
PEOPLE EVER MADE LOVE.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
THEY DIDN'T
KISS EACH OTHER.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
TOO BUSY THINKING ABOUT
THE WHITE MAN AND ABOUT

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
RACISM AND HOW OUR
PEOPLE CAN SUCCEED.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
AND THERE WERE LOTS OF
REASONS FOR THAT, OF COURSE.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
SO, THE BOOK WAS
CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
OF ITS DEPICTION OF
JANIE'S INDEPENDENCE

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
AND HER SENSUALITY,
HER SEXUALITY,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
AND HER WILL TO
SELF-DETERMINATION.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
AND HER CAPACITY TO
DETERMINE HER SELF.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
GROUNDBREAKING IN
ITS TIME, IT IS THIS

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
CAPACITY IN ZORA
NEALE HURSTON'S WORK

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
THAT MAKES IT RESONATE
SO PROFOUNDLY TODAY.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
THE ULTIMATE CLAIM TO
SELFHOOD FOR THE AFRICAN

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
AMERICAN PEOPLE WAS MADE
BY ZORA NEALE HURSTON

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
IN "THEIR EYES WERE
WATCHING GOD".

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
WE HAVE A WORLD INDEPENDENT
OF THE WHITE WORLD.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
MANY TIMES IN
BLACK LITERATURE,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
THE WHITE WORLD,
ONE MIGHT SAY,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
BECOMES THE
PROTAGONIST.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
THE WHITE MAN, THE MAN,
RACISM, OPPRESSION -

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
THAT'S WHAT THE
BOOK IS ABOUT.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
AND THEN ABOUT HOW SOME
SENSITIVE MAN OVERCOMES,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
OR IS CRUSHED BY - IN THE
CASE OF BIGGER THOMAS

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
IN RICHARD WRIGHT'S
"NATIVE SON"

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
PUBLISHED JUST
THREE YEARS LATER.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
THAT'S THE DOMINANT PLOT.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
HURSTON WAS
"FORGET ALL THAT.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
HOW DO WE MAKE LOVE, HOW
DO WE LOVE EACH OTHER,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
HOW DO WE ABUSE EACH OTHER,
HOW DO WE VIOLATE

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
EACH OTHER, HOW DO
WE NEED TO CHANGE?

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
HOW DO WE
CELEBRATE CULTURE?

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
HOW DO WE MAKE CULTURE?

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
WHAT IS OUR
CULTURAL ETHOS?

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.000
WHAT MAKES US KEEP
ON KEEPING ON?

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
WHAT MAKES US
GET OUT OF BED?

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
HOW DO WE TRIUMPH
OVER DESPAIR?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
OVER EXISTENTIAL ANXIETY?

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
OVER ANGST?

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
OVER THE OPPRESSION
CREATED BY ECONOMIC

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
EXPLOITATION OR
ANTI-BLACK RACISM?"

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
IT MAY SEEM BAFFLING TO US
TODAY, BUT AS FRESH AND AS

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
HONEST AS HER WORK WAS
FOR ITS TIME, IT WAS NOT

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
THE STORY THAT SHE TOLD
THAT CAUSED CONTROVERSY.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.000
RATHER, IT WAS THE
WAY SHE TOLD IT.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
IT WAS AN ATTEMPT
TO INCORPORATE THE

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:31.000
BLACK VERNACULAR INTO
STANDARD LITERARY IDIOM.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
IT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO
INCORPORATE THE AFRICAN

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
AMERICAN VERNACULAR INTO
THE LANGUAGE THAT IS

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
APPROPRIATE TO USE TO TELL
THE TALE OF THE NOVEL.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
IN OTHER WORDS, SHE
WANTED TO PROVE THAT BLACK

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
DIALECT HAD THE STUFF -
HAD THE ENERGY, HAD THE

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
RESILIENCE, HAD THE
RESONANCE, THE CAPACITY -

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
TO CARRY A TALE OVER A
COUPLE HUNDRED PAGES.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
BUT IT WAS ALSO
CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE OF

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
ITS USE OF DIALECT - IT'S
RECUPERATION OF DIALECT -

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
AND RICHARD WRIGHT FELT
THAT HURSTON WAS DONNING

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
A MINSTREL MASK FOR WHITE
PATRONS, SHOWING THE

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
DARKIES IN THE FIELD, UM,
PEOPLE DOWN ON THE MUCK

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
PLAYING THE BANJO AND
CUTTING UP AND PLAYING THE

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
DOZENS AND SIGNIFYING AND
INSULTING EACH OTHER IN

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
THE RITUAL WAYS PECULIAR TO
AFRICAN-AMERICAN CULTURE.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
OTHER WRITERS OR
CONTEMPORARIES OF THE TIME

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
DISAGREED WITH HER USE
OF BLACK VERNACULAR.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
SHE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING
WRONG OR PANDERING

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
IN HER APPROACH TO USING
THE BLACK VERNACULAR,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
AND SHE WANTED TO
EXPOSE THE BEAUTY

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
OF THOSE CULTURAL
ELEMENTS,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
LANGUAGE BEING ONE OF THEM
- ONE OF THE MAJOR ONES.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
SHE WANTED TO BROADEN
THE EXPOSURE OF THOSE

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
CULTURAL ELEMENTS FROM
THE BLACK COMMUNITY

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
TO A WHITE
AUDIENCE TO ALMOST

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
INCREASE THEIR HUMANITY
AND BROADEN THEIR

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT
BLACK CULTURE WAS ABOUT.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
IN THE HARLEM OF THE
1920'S, BLACK DIALECT

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
OR BLACK VERNACULAR
ENGLISH WAS CONSIDERED

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
BY MANY TO BE
AN EMBARRASSMENT.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
IT WAS THE LANGUAGE
OF STEREOTYPE,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
THE LANGUAGE OF
VAUDEVILLE,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
AND OF A TYPE OF
"BLACK DIALECT POETRY"

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
THAT WAS POPULAR
AT THE TIME.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS
FOUND ITS USE DEMEANING.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
WHAT WAS THE EFFECT OF HER
USE OF THE BLACK VERNACULAR?

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
IT WAS THIS: THE NOVEL STARTS
OFF IN STANDARD ENGLISH:

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
"SHIPS AT A DISTANCE HAVE
EVERY MAN'S WISH ON BOARD".

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
ANYONE COULD HAVE WRITTEN
THAT SENTENCE IN THE 1930'S.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
WITHIN A FEW PARAGRAPHS
THERE'S THE UNMEDIATED

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
VOICE OF THE AFRICAN
AMERICAN COMMUNITY.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
BLACK DIALECT.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
"WHAT'S SHE DOING
COMING BACK HERE

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
WEARING THEM OVERALLS?

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
SHE AIN'T NO
YOUNG GAL NO MORE.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
WHERE'S THAT YOUNG
MAN SHE RAN OFF WITH?"

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
"WHERE HE LEFT HER?

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
WHAT HE DONE WID
 ALL HER MONEY?

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
BETCHA HE BE OFF WID
 SOME GAL SO YOUNG

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
SHE AIN'T EVEN
 GOT NO HAIRS.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
WHY SHE DON'T
 STAY IN HER CLASS?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
WHEN SHE GOT TO WHERE THEY
 WASE SHE TURNED HER FACE

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
ON THE BANDER
 LOG AND SPOKE.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
THEY SCRAMBLED A
 NOISY 'GOOD EVENIN'

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
AND LEFT THEIR
 MOUTHS SETTING OPEN

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
AND THEIR EARS
 FULL OF HOPE."

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE
GREEK CHORUS EQUIVALENT.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
IT'S THE VOICE OF
THE AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
COMMUNITY, ANONYMOUS
AND COLLECTIVE,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
UNDIFFERENTIATED IN THE
TEXT, JUST A BUNCH OF

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
SENTENCES AND QUESTIONS
RUNNING TOGETHER.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
THOSE ARE THE LINGUISTIC
EXTREMES OF THE NOVEL

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
ESTABLISHED IN
THE FIRST CHAPTER

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
IN THE FIRST FOUR
OR FIVE PARAGRAPHS.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
STANDARD ENGLISH
AT ONE EXTREME,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
BLACK VERNACULAR ENGLISH
AT THE OTHER EXTREME.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
A CURIOUS THING HAPPENS.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
THOSE TWO VOICES
MERGE IN A COMBINED

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
STANDARD ENGLISH/BLACK
VERNACULAR

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
DISCURSIVE VOICE
THROUGH THE VOICE

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
OF THE NARRATOR AS
THE TEXT GOES ALONG.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
THE ACHIEVEMENT OF
PRODUCING A THIRD TERM,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
ONE HALF WAY BETWEEN
STANDARD ENGLISH

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
AND THE BLACK
VERNACULAR.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
ZORA NEALE HURSTON WAS
A GENIUS TO BE ABLE TO

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
ACHIEVE THAT EFFECT.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
MANY OF HURSTON'S
CONTEMPORARIES

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
- RICHARD WRIGHT
IN PARTICULAR -

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
WERE GREATLY DISPLEASED
WITH HER WORK.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
BUT HURSTON HAD COME
FROM A PLACE WHERE

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
ALL FACETS OF BLACK
CULTURE WERE CELEBRATED.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:36.000
SHE WAS COMFORTABLE
IN HER SKIN.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
THAT WAS ONE OF THE
MAJOR DIFFERENCES

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
BETWEEN RICHARD WRIGHT
AND ZORA NEALE HURSTON.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
ZORA GROWING UP FEELING
VERY COMFORTABLE IN HER

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
BLACKNESS, HAD NO SHAME IN
SHARING THAT AND SHOUTING

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
THAT FROM THE MOUNTAIN TOP
SO TO SPEAK, AND DIDN'T

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
SEE IT AS SOMETHING THAT
WAS A DISADVANTAGE TO HER

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
BY NOT EMBRACING THOSE
THINGS THAT REPRESENTED

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
WHITE AND PRIVILEGE
AND POWER AROUND HER.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
I THINK THAT SPEAKS
TO THE DIFFERENCE IN

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
SOCIALIZATION BETWEEN
BEING RAISED IN AN

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
ALL-BLACK TOWN AND
WALLOWING IN THAT BLACKNESS

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
AND FEELING VERY
COMFORTABLE AND

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
APPRECIATIVE ALMOST OF IT
VERSUS BEING RAISED

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
IN A BLACK BACKSIDE OF A
TOWN WHERE YOU GET BEAT UP

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
BY THE FACT THAT
YOU ARE NOT WHITE.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000
IN THE SUCCEEDING YEARS,
HURSTON'S WORK ALTERNATED

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
BETWEEN HER LITERARY
PURSUITS AND HER

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
ANTHROPOLOGICAL
FIELD STUDIES.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
SHE WAS HIRED AS A
DRAMA INSTRUCTOR AT THE

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
NORTH CAROLINA COLLEGE
FOR NEGROES IN DURHAM,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
AND SPENT TIME IN SOUTH
CAROLINA COLLECTING

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
NEGRO FOLKLORE,
WRITING ALL THE WHILE.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
OVER THE SUMMER OF 1941
HURSTON COMPLETED

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
HER AUTOBIOGRAPHY,
"DUST TRACKS ON A ROAD".

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
PUBLISHED THE FOLLOWING
YEAR, IT WAS AWARDED THE

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
ANISFIELD-WOLF BOOK
AWARD IN RACE RELATIONS,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
AND HURSTON WAS
HONORED ON THE COVER

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
OF THE SATURDAY REVIEW.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
SHE SPENT NEARLY A YEAR
IN BRITISH HONDURAS

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
RESEARCHING THE
BLACK COMMUNITIES

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
OF CENTRAL AMERICA.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
IT WAS DURING THIS
TIME THAT SHE WROTE

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
WHAT WOULD BE HER LAST
MAJOR PUBLISHED WORK,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
"SERAPH ON THE SUWANEE".

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
IN MARCH OF 1948
ZORA RETURNED TO

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
THE UNITED STATES.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
AND IN SEPTEMBER OF THAT
YEAR BEGAN ONE OF THE MOST

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
BIZARRE AND UNFORTUNATE
EVENTS IN ZORA'S LIFE.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
A FORMER LANDLADY ACCUSED
HURSTON OF MOLESTING

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
THE WOMAN'S
10-YEAR-OLD SON,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
ALONG WITH TWO OTHER
NEIGHBORHOOD CHILDREN.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
HURSTON WAS TAKEN TO
THE POLICE STATION,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
FINGERPRINTED AND
BOOKED ON CHARGES

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
OF SEXUALLY ABUSING
THE THREE BOYS.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
THE ACCUSATIONS
WERE GROUNDLESS.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
HURSTON COULD PROVE
SHE WAS IN HONDURAS

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
WHEN THE CRIME HAD
ALLEGEDLY TAKEN PLACE.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
ALL CHARGES WERE
EVENTUALLY DROPPED

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
WHEN THE BOYS ADMITTED
THE STORY WAS FABRICATED.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
BUT IN AN ATMOSPHERE
SIMILAR TO TODAY'S

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
MEDIA CIRCUS
SURROUNDING CELEBRITIES,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
THE "AFRO-AMERICAN", A
NATIONAL NEWSPAPER BASED

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
IN BALTIMORE, VICIOUSLY
HEADLINED THE STORY.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
THE CONSERVATIVE PAPER
EVEN QUOTED DIALOGUE

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:35.000
FROM ZORA'S FICTION TO
IMPLY HER GUILT IN FACT.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
THE FALSE ACCUSATIONS
LEVELED AGAINST ZORA

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
WERE QUITE
DEVASTATING TO HER.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
SHE WAS CRUSHED BY THE
FACT THAT IT WAS THE

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
BLACK PRESS THAT
GRABBED THE STORY,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
REALLY WANTED TO HAVE
SOMETHING ON HER,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
RAN WITH IT BIG
TIME, AND EVEN AFTER

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
THE GRAND JURY DROPPED
THE CASE BECAUSE

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
IT WAS NOT WARRANTED
AT ALL, THE BLACK PRESS

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
REALLY WASN'T THERE
THEN TO EAT THEIR WORDS

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
AND TAKE THIS BACK.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
AND I THINK THAT SHE
FELT SOLD OUT BY HER OWN

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
AND THAT STARTED SHAKING
THE FOUNDATION OF HER

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
UNDERSTANDING AROUND
THIS COMMUNITY OF BLACKS.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
OR IT COULD HAVE ALSO
SHOWED HER HOW DISTORTED

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
HER VIEW OF HERSELF
WAS THROUGH THEM,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
AND IT STARTED
HER DOWNFALL IN

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
HER ABILITY TO
CONCENTRATE AND WORK.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
HER SPIRIT WAS SHAKEN AT
THAT POINT AND SHE FOUND

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
IT DIFFICULT - ALTHOUGH
SHE DID CONTINUE TO WORK

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
SHE FOUND IT DIFFICULT.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
AND THEN HER HEALTH
STARTED FAILING, I THINK,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
RIGHT AROUND THAT AND
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
THE CONFLUENCE OF
THOSE TWO THINGS

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000
THAT REALLY BROUGHT
HER DOWN TO THE END.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
THE ACCUSATIONS HAD
BEEN EXPOSED AS FALSE,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
BUT HER HUMILIATION
WAS ALL TOO REAL.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
HER OWN COMMUNITY
HAD PERSECUTED HER.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
SHE LEFT NEW YORK CITY
IN 1949, AND HEADED

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
FOR THE EMOTIONAL
AND PHYSICAL WARMTH

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
OF HER REMEMBERED SOUTH.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
LIVING ON A FRIEND'S
BOAT IN MIAMI FOR A TIME,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
SHE EARNED A FEW
DOLLARS HERE AND THERE

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
FROM HER WRITING.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
BUT BY 1950, ALL BUT THE
MOST RECENT OF HER BOOKS,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
"SERAPH ON THE SUWANEE",
WERE OUT OF PRINT.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
MONEY WAS RUNNING SHORT.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
ZORA CONTINUED WRITING
WHILE ACCEPTING EMPLOYMENT

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
AS A DOMESTIC IN THE HOME
OF A WEALTHY WHITE COUPLE.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000
IN MARCH 1950 THE SATURDAY
EVENING POST PUBLISHED

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
HER STORY "CONSCIENCE
OF THE COURT".

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
IT WAS ONLY THEN THAT HER
RICH RIVO ISLAND EMPLOYERS,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
READING THE MAGAZINE,
RECOGNIZED HER NAME

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
AND REALIZED WHO WAS
WASHING THEIR WINDOWS.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
WHEN THE MIAMI HERALD RAN
A STORY TITLED, IN PART,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
"FAMOUS NEGRO AUTHOR
WORKING AS A MAID",

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
OFFERS OF FREELANCE
WRITING ASSIGNMENTS

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
BEGAN COMING IN,
AND ZORA HURSTON

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
MADE A LIVING FROM
WRITING ONCE MORE.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
IN THE SUCCEEDING
YEARS SHE WORKED AS

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
A COURT REPORTER
COVERING A SENSATIONAL

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
FLORIDA MURDER TRIAL
FOR A PITTSBURGH

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
PENNSYLVANIA NEWSPAPER
AND AS A COLUMNIST

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
FOR THE FORT PIERCE,
FLORIDA "CHRONICLE,"

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
WHERE SHE CALLED UPON HER
ANTHROPOLOGICAL STUDIES

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:23.000
TO WRITE ON "HOODOO
AND BLACK MAGIC".

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
IN 1959 ZORA SUFFERED
A STROKE AND,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
IN OCTOBER OF THAT
YEAR, ENTERED A

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
WELFARE HOME IN ST.
LUCIE COUNTY, FLORIDA.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE
HAD LONG SINCE ENDED,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
A NEW AGE OF BLACK PRIDE
WAS ON THE HORIZON,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
AND ZORA NEALE HURSTON
WAS ALL BUT FORGOTTEN.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
EVEN HER
BEST-KNOWN WORK,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
"THEIR EYES WERE WATCHING
GOD" WAS OUT OF PRINT.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
NOT BECAUSE ITS LITERARY
VALUE HAD LESSENED

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
BUT BECAUSE ITS LITERARY
VENUE HAD CHANGED.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN LETTERS
NO LONGER HAD A PLACE FOR

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
HURSTON'S DEPICTION OF THE
SOUTHERN BLACKS SHE KNEW,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
FOR HER HONEST AND, SOME
FELT, DEMEANING PORTRAIT

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
OF THEIR LANGUAGE, THEIR
CUSTOMS AND THEIR FOIBLES.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
IN FACT, MUCH OF
WHAT HURSTON WROTE -

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
BOTH FICTION AND
ESSAY - STOOD IN STARK

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
PHILOSOPHICAL CONTRAST
TO HER CONTEMPORARIES.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
SHE REGULARLY
CONTRIBUTED TO

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
AMERICAN LEGION MAGAZINE,
ARTICLES WITH SUCH TITLES

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000
AS "WHY THE NEGRO
WON'T BUY COMMUNISM"

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
AND "I SAW NEGRO
VOTES PEDDLED".

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
SHE WAS A STAUNCH
CONSERVATIVE AMONG

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
AN OPENLY
LEFT-LEANING LOT.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
ZORA'S VIEWS
ON RACE RELATIONS

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
DIFFERED FROM MOST
BLACKS IN GENERAL

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
AND SOUTHERN BLACKS IN
PARTICULAR OF THAT DAY

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
IN THAT SHE WAS
AGAINST INTEGRATION.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
SHE DID NOT FEEL IT WOULD
IMPROVE THE CONDITION

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
OF BLACKS BY JUST MIXING
THEM IN WITH WHITES.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
SHE THOUGHT THAT THE
CULTURAL UNIQUENESS

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
AND HERITAGE OF AFRICAN
DESCENDED PEOPLE

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
WOULD BE LOST IN THAT.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
SO THE IDEA OF
STRIPPING ALL THAT OFF

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
AND ASSIMILATING TO
ELEVATE YOUR STATUS

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
WAS NOT AN OPTION AS
FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
SHE WANTED A MORE
PLURALIST APPROACH.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
THAT THERE DIDN'T NEED TO
BE JUST ONE CULTURE THAT

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
WAS ELEVATED AND RESPECTED
AND ASSIMILATED TO,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
SHE THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD
GO SHOULDER TO SHOULDER,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
THAT THEY COULD SHARE
THE AMERICAN PALETTE.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT
HURSTON DISAPPEARED

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
BECAUSE SHE BECAME A
CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
SOME PEOPLE SAY SHE
DISAPPEARED BECAUSE SHE

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
EFFECTIVELY OPPOSED
BROWN V BOARD, THE FAMOUS

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
SUPREME COURT DECISION IN
1954 WHICH OSTENSIBLY LED

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
TO THE DESEGREGATION OF
SCHOOLS WHICH, OF COURSE,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
IT DIDN'T, BUT IT
DID IN SOME PLACES

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
LIKE MY HOME TOWN
IN WEST VIRGINIA.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
I THINK THAT HURSTON WAS
AWAITING A READERSHIP

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
TO SUSTAIN HER,
LIKE ANY WRITER.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
SHE WAS WIDELY CELEBRATED,
WIDELY REVIEWED,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:04.000
BUT RICHARD WRIGHT BY
PUBLISHING "NATIVE SON"

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
IN 1940 JUST CHANGED
THE LITERARY LANDSCAPE.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
ZORA NEALE HURSTON
DIED OF "HYPERTENSIVE

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
HEART DISEASE"
ON JANUARY 28TH 1960,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
AND WAS BURIED IN
FORT PIERCE, FLORIDA.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
IT WOULD BE NEARLY
A GENERATION BEFORE

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
ANOTHER NOTED WRITER
OF COLOR, ALICE WALKER,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
WOULD DISCOVER HURSTON'S
WORK AND HELP RETURN HER

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
TO THE SPOT IN
THE AMERICAN CANON

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
THAT SHE HAD SO
RIGHTLY EARNED.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
IN MARCH 1975,
WALKER PUBLISHED

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
"IN SEARCH OF ZORA
NEALE HURSTON"

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
IN "MS." MAGAZINE.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
HER ACCOUNT OF A PILGRIMAGE
TO HURSTON'S UNMARKED GRAVE

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:51.000
IS CREDITED WITH LAUNCHING
THE HURSTON REVIVAL.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
IN A VARIETY OF WAYS
YOU CAN DRAW A LINE

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
BETWEEN HURSTON AND
THIS GENERATION OF

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN
WOMEN WRITERS.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
MANY OF THEM, SUCH
AS ALICE WALKER AND

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
"THE COLOR PURPLE",
ARE OBVIOUSLY REWRITING

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
"THEIR EYES
WERE WATCHING GOD".

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
THEY'RE ECHOING, THEY'RE
BORROWING FROM IT.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
THEY'RE RIFFING ON IT,
THEY'RE STANDING ON

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
HURSTON'S SHOULDERS.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
THAT'S HOW ANY LITERARY
TRADITION UNFOLDS.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
IT'S ABOUT READING AND
REVISING ANTECEDENT TEXTS

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
OF THE TRADITION LIKE
LINKS IN A CHAIN.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
IT'S SIGNIFYING.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000
IT'S RIFFING IN JAZZ.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
SHE WAS DEFYING ALL SORTS
OF CONVENTION AND I THINK

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:39.000
SHE'S NOW BEING REWARDED
ALL THESE YEARS LATER.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000
"I KNOW THAT NOTHING
 IS DESTRUCTIBLE;

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
THINGS MERELY
 CHANGE FORMS.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
WHEN THE CONSCIOUSNESS
 OF LIFE CEAS,

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
I KNOW I SHALL BE PART
 AND PARCEL OF THE WORLD.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
WHY FEAR?

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
THE STUFF OF MY BEING IS
 MATTER, EVER CHANGING,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:04.000
EVER MOVING,
 BUT NEVER LOST."

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
FOR A TIME, AMERICAN
LETTERS HAD LOST

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
ZORA NEALE HURSTON.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:18.000
BUT NOW, WE HAVE
FOUND HER AGAIN.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
"MY NAME IS ZORA
 NEALE HURSTON

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:28.000
AND I'M GOING TO
 SING A GAMBLING SONG.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:37.000
* LET THE DEAL GO DOWN,
 BOY, LET THE DEAL GO DOWN

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000
(ANOTHER CARD FALLS
 OFF THE DECK)

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:50.000
WHEN YOUR CARD
 GET LUCKY, OHHHH,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:41:01.000
LET THE DEAL GO DOWN,
 BOY, LET THE DEAL GO DOWN

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:11.000
LET THE DEAL GO DOWN, BOY,
 LET THE DEAL GO DOWN. *
