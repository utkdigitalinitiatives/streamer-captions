company in U.S. business
history.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:08.160

Squiggly!
>> SMITH: This is team Wal-Mart,

>> Our Wal-Mart!

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:29.100

>> The customer, always!
>> SMITH: And Wal-Mart is a
company unlike any other.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:37.700
>> Your company was the first
company on the planet to report
one-quarter of a trillion
dollars in sales-- $256 billion.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.930
(<i> cheers and applause</i> )

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:52.560
Do you know what that is?
That's one IBM, one Hewlett-
Packard, one Dell computer, one
Microsoft and one Cisco System.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.760
And, oh, by the way, after that
we've got $2 billion left over.
>> SMITH: As the world's largest
company, Wal-Mart has tremendous

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:08.700
power and influence.
It is now the model not just for
retailing, but for companies all
across the corporate landscape.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.400
>> ♪ I'm doing my part
for my Wal-Mart... ♪
>> In the 19th Century, it was
the Pennsylvania Railroad, which

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.560
called itself the standard of
the world.
Early 20th Century, it might
have been U.S. Steel.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.400
General Motors, of course, in
the mid-20th Century.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:31.330
But clearly, Wal-Mart today is
setting sort of a... new
standards that other firms have
to follow if they hope to

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.160
compete.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:43.560
And more than just other firms,
it's setting standards for the
nation as a whole.
(<i> crowd cheering</i> )

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.900
>> SMITH: By figuring out how to
exploit two powerful forces that
converged in the '90s-- the rise
of information technology and

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.330
the explosion of the global
economy-- Wal-Mart has changed
the balance of power in the
world of business.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.230
>> It used to be that
manufacturers, big multinational
manufacturers, had the most
power, companies like General

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.160
Motors and General Electric.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:21.730
Today, I think that global
retailers actually have become
the most powerful companies in
the global economy.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:28.000
>> SMITH: To understand Wal-Mart
and how a company with such
humble roots has managed to
build a global empire, I headed

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.700
for Bentonville, Arkansas.
It's an overgrown crossroads
town tucked into the bible and
barbecue belt of northwest

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:44.300
Arkansas.
Here, in the heart of the old
town, sits the five-and-dime
store that Sam Walton opened in

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:56.830
1950.
A few blocks away I found the
Wal-Mart of today, the Wal-Mart
we've come to know as consumers,

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:05.530
a cornucopia of thousands of
different items all under one
roof-- the epitome of one-stop
shopping.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.300
>> How you all doing today?
Thank you for coming to Wal-
Mart.
>> SMITH: Every week, Wal-Mart

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:16.700
says, 100 million American
shoppers stream into its 3,400
stores.
>> It's very convenient for me

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.760
to be able to get a one-stop
shop.
>> I know I don't have to look
and see where I can save the

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.900
most money.
I know when I come in here I can
save money.
>> Good prices.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:32.600
Good quality of stuff.
>> I'm thinking about having my
social security check direct-
deposited to Wal-Mart, since I

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:40.130
buy everything at Wal-Mart.
>> What makes Wal-Mart
successful, what keeps us
motivated, and what really

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:46.360
challenges us every day, whether
it was from the day one when
Wal-Mart began or until today, I
think it's the same:

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.760
that we really strive in
everything we do to keep our
costs as low as possible so that
we can provide the customer a

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.400
value and still make a
reasonable profit for us, for
our company.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:04.100
>> SMITH: That was Sam Walton's
formula: buy cheap, sell for
less than the other guy, and
make your profit on high volume

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:13.160
and fast turnover.
Sounds simple, but this
supercenter is a world away from
Sam's five-and-dime.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:21.600
How do they keep track of it
all?
How do they know what to stock?
How do they keep prices so low?

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.530
>> What I'm going to do is show
you how we use this Telxon unit
in our stores.
>> SMITH: Linda Dillman is Wal-

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.830
Mart's chief information
officer...
>> Here we have a display of
flashlights.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:39.500
>> SMITH: Right.
...and she let me in on one of
Wal-Mart's most important tools,
a little gadget called a Telxon.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:45.660
>> It tells me the sale price of
the item, how many I currently
have.
And it knows what the history

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:52.400
looks like for tracking each
sale as it occurs.
We know what we think it will do
going forward based on its

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.360
trend.
>> SMITH: Wal-Mart was one of
the first retailers to
understand the power of

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:03.460
information hidden in the bar
code.
This little barcode here is not
just a simple thing, it's almost

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.900
an encyclopedia of information.
>> Absolutely.
It allows us to tie this item to
a lot of information we know

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.660
about it that we can only
collect because we have that
barcode.
>> SMITH: How many items do you

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:18.800
have in a store like this?
>> Over 100,000.
So close to 120,000 items.
>> SMITH: Wal-Mart couldn't

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:25.730
manage without the barcode.
It helps them overcome one of
retailing's thorniest problems:
getting the right mix of

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:33.030
products in the store.
>> You can track sales on
specific items, specific weeks,
specific days, specific hours of

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:38.760
the day.
>> SMITH: Jon Lehman worked at
Wal-Mart for 17 years.
He managed six different stores.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:44.700
Disillusioned, he quit to go
work for a union trying to
organize Wal-Mart workers.
>> You can track sales spikes

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:50.730
during the year, during certain
seasonal periods and...
>> SMITH: Clothes, sizes...
>> It's incredible.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:56.900
Clothes, sizes, colors, flavors,
all of those things.
It's... it's just... It's really
incredible.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:02.700
>> SMITH: With its own
supercomputer, Wal-Mart
streamlined its supply chain,
speeding delivery from plant to

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:09.530
store shelf.
>> The sale is recorded, and
then an order is automatically
generated that evening at

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:14.200
midnight.
And that warehouse fills that
order, and it's sitting back on
the shelf the next night or the

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:20.560
following night.
>> SMITH: Wal-Mart became a
world leader in logistics, and
promoted greater efficiency

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:27.060
among its suppliers.
Some analysts even credit Wal-
Mart with increasing U.S.
productivity.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:34.900
>> Wal-Mart, as an efficiency
machine, has just done better
than any other U.S. retailer, or
perhaps any other U.S. company

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:41.000
in history.
>> SMITH: With other mass retail
chains like Target and K-Mart,
Wal-Mart generated a revolution

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.630
in how goods are produced, a
shift from what's called "push
production" to "pull
production."

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:57.260
>> The push system involves
manufacturers deciding what
they're going to produce and
then trying to get retailers to

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.400
buy it and sell it for them.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:09.260
The pull system involves
retailers deciding what is being
sold, collecting information on
what is being sold, and then

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:17.230
telling the manufacturers what
to produce and when to produce
it based on what is actually
being sold.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:24.360
>> SMITH: Wal-Mart's pull is so
powerful that here in
Bentonville, manufacturers have
set up satellite sales offices.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:33.160
In what's now known as
Vendorville, I found a who's-who
of Wal-Mart vendors.
In one corporate office park, I

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:39.930
found a sock manufacturer,
Kentucky Derby Hosiery.
Its CEO is Bill Nichol.
>> Yes, if you want to sell

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:45.760
Wal-Mart, you know, you need to
come to Bentonville.
It's been that way for a long
time.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:52.660
I don't see that that's going to
change.
So people who travel a lot found
it may be more convenient just

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:57.800
to have an office here; that
they were continuously coming to
Bentonville.
So a lot of them just moved

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:05.660
here, or at least opened an
office here.
>> SMITH: The suppliers come in
droves, hungry for big

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:14.060
contracts.
They get herded into little
rooms for bargaining sessions
with Wal-Mart buyers.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:22.230
>> They force all of us, by
really good business discipline,
to be sure we're paying
attention at all times to what

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.930
their customers want to buy.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:32.330
It serves the purpose of saying,
"This is what they want, and
they want to buy it at this
price; therefore, that's what

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.960
we'd better be doing," our
little company.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:43.630
>> SMITH: The focus is on what
matters most to Wal-Mart:
prices.
>> Well, it's very one-sided.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:47.630
There is no negotiation.
There's not much negotiation at
all.
The manufacturer walks into the

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:54.230
room-- I've been in these little
cubicles; I've seen it happen--
the buyer says, "Look, we want
you to sell it to us for 5% on a

00:11:54.230 --> 00:12:03.230
dollar at cost, lower this year
than you did last year."
They know every fact and figure
that these manufacturers have.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:09.300
They know their books, they know
their costs, they know their
business practices, everything,
you know.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:14.500
So, what's a manufacturer left
to do?
They sit naked in front of Wal-
Mart.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.900
You know, Wal-Mart calls the
shots.
"If you want to do business with
us, if you want to stay in

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:24.000
business, then you're going to
do it our way."
And it's all about driving down
the cost of goods.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:31.000
>> The power of Wal-Mart is
such, it's reversed a 100-year
history in which the
manufacturer was powerful and

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.100
the retailer was sort of the
vassal.
It's changed that.
It turned that around entirely.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:42.260
Now the retailer, the mass
global retailer, is the...
that's the center, that's the
power, and the manufacturer

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:48.460
becomes the serf, the vassal,
the underling who has to do the
bidding of the retailer.
That's a new thing.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.930
>> SMITH: I wanted to see how
this bold new world of retail
power had changed the game for
established brand-name

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:07.900
manufacturers.
So I headed to Wooster, Ohio, a
small college town and longtime
home to one of America's best-

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:17.130
known brands: Rubbermaid, maker
of plastic pails, garbage cans,
and all kinds of containers.
>> We were one of the best-known

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:25.160
brand names in America because
we were in virtually every home,
one way or another.
>> SMITH: Very, very impressive

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:32.360
display here.
Stanley Gault was CEO of
Rubbermaid through the 1980s and
early '90s.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:38.930
Gault bet Rubbermaid's future on
supplying big-box discount
chains like Wal-Mart.
>> The tea leaves said you

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:44.330
better be a part of this
growing... of these growing new
segments.
They provide a tremendous

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:52.060
opportunity for growth and for
volume sales.
And they can take a new product
and make it a success overnight.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:57.430
>> SMITH: One of Gault's rising
lieutenants was Wolfgang
Schmitt, who would later become
CEO.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:02.800
>> Well, there was a dramatic
shift over a relatively short
period of time as we went from
thousands of customers that we

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.400
were selling to, to where five
or seven of our customers
represented two-thirds of our
volume.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:12.200
>> SMITH: These big-box
retailers.
>> The big-box, mass merchants.
You have to have a very tight

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:19.100
relationship with them, and you
have to be important to them.
>> SMITH: No customer was more
important to Gault than

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.060
Wal-Mart.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:28.530
>> When I came to Rubbermaid,
they did not sell Wal-Mart.
They were selling to K-Mart, but
they wouldn't sell Wal-Mart.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:37.060
Well, within a short period of
time, Wal-Mart... Really within
a year, they were our largest
company.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:41.100
>><i> Tired of dragging your</i>
<i>garbage to the end of the</i>
<i>driveway?</i>
<i>Then roll it with a Rough Neck</i>

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.960
<i>Wheeled Refuse Container from</i>
<i>Rubbermaid.</i>
<i>Heavy-duty construction...</i>
>> SMITH: The Wal-Mart account

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:54.930
helped fuel Rubbermaid's rapid
growth.
Sales and profits soared.
>><i> Rubbermaid: ideas that last.</i>

00:14:54.930 --> 00:15:01.730
>> SMITH: Its products were so
highly regarded for quality that
Rubbermaid was voted the
nation's most-admired company in

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.400
1994.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:09.360
>> It's really your peer group,
the other manufacturers out
there in the world, saying,
"This is the company that is

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:15.700
really doing it, they're doing
all the things right, and
they're doing the things that
make them very admired-- our

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.930
brand name, our quality, our
product development."

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:25.030
>> SMITH: But behind the
headlines, Rubbermaid was
struggling to maintain its
ambitious growth targets.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:30.360
Then suddenly it found itself in
a showdown with its biggest
customer.
>> The price of resin

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:38.060
skyrocketed.
And resin is a huge component of
any plastic product that you
make.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:47.830
And when we went out with a
price increase across the
industry to all retailers,
saying, "Our raw material costs

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:53.630
have increased significantly.
We have to get a price increase
for our products," Wal-Mart
would not take that price

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:58.130
increase.
They flat-out refused to take
the price increase.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:04.930
>> SMITH: Other mass retailers
agreed to a price hike, and
Rubbermaid's CEO flew to
Arkansas to ask Bill Fields,

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:10.630
head of Wal-Mart stores, to
reconsider.
>> They were very public in
those days, as you might recall,

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:16.930
as were a lot of retailers,
about saying, "One of the
advantages we as big-box
retailers have is we can put the

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:22.560
hammer to the manufacturers and
we can give American consumers
lower prices."

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.260
>> SMITH: So did Fields put the
hammer to you?
>> Oh, in his own way,
certainly.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:34.700
>> I thought it was a vindictive
kind of meeting that said,
"Yes, you may be Rubbermaid, and
you're a big Rubbermaid, and you

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:40.730
got the great name and all that,
but you're not going to tell us
what to do.
And we're not going to take your

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:45.060
price increase, and we really
don't care what it does to you."
>> SMITH: So what does it mean
to you?

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:50.360
Do you lose shelf space, do you
lose volume to Wal-Mart at that
point?
>> Sure.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:58.430
You know, when push comes to
shove, their way of disciplining
the supplier is to show that,
you know, volume can be given or

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:08.330
it can be taken.
>> And they dropped a number of
our products for a couple years,
just dropped those products.

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:18.160
That impacts the company
tremendously.
To me, it was one of the first
signs of the decline of

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:24.030
Rubbermaid.
>> SMITH: I asked a Wal-Mart
spokesman about the clash with
Rubbermaid because Bill Fields,

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:27.360
no longer at Wal-Mart, didn't
answer<i> Frontline's</i> inquiries.

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:33.900
>> Whatever happened there, I'm
sorry I can't comment because I
it predates me and I'm not
familiar with the specifics.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:41.100
But I would just reemphasize
that it is not our intent to be
bullies as buyers to our
suppliers.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:49.930
>> SMITH: Wal-Mart's pullback
was a body blow to Rubbermaid.
Coupled with lax management at
Rubbermaid, it plunged the

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:59.630
company into deep trouble.
In 1999, Rubbermaid sold out to
Newell, a major competitor.
By the time I arrived in

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:06.560
Wooster, five years later, it
had come to this...
(<i> Auctioneer calling out</i>
<i>prices</i> )

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:16.060
>> SMITH: ...Rubbermaid
auctioning off its birthright.
(<i> Auctioneer calling out</i>
<i>prices</i> )

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.760
>> SMITH: Where are the buyers
from?
>> They're from all over.
We've got guys from all over the

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:26.400
50 states.
We've got two guys in from South
America, two guys from Italy, a
guy from Spain, two guys from

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.930
over in Japan or China area.
>> SMITH: A couple of guys from
China?
>> Yeah.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.130
>> SMITH: And they're buying
here?
>> They're buying... they bought
the one big machine today, yeah.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.700
>> SMITH: The Chinese guys
bought the big machine?
>> Right.
It's an injection machine.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:44.400
They bought it, I believe, for
$850,000.
>> SMITH: So Rubbermaid's
original plant was closing shop,

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:50.030
and countries like China were
picking up the pieces.
>> You know, when you think of
Wooster, you think of

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.330
Rubbermaid; and you think of
Rubbermaid, you think of
Wooster.
I mean, this is what this town

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:58.630
is all about.
>> SMITH: So what's it going to
be without... when you move all
this stuff out; you've got a

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:02.160
carcass here.
>> Exactly.
>> SMITH: I mean, is the town a
carcass, too?

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:07.400
>> Well there is about 1,000
jobs that were lost here.
Close to 1,000 jobs.
>> SMITH: It seemed to me that

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:17.000
it wasn't just a plant dying; a
set of corporate values was
passing away.
Ten years ago, Rubbermaid, with

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.900
its reputation for quality, was
named "Most Admired."
Last year, Wal-Mart, known for
its cost-cutting, was most

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.100
admired.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:34.400
If you look at the shift from
Rubbermaid as the most-admired
company in 1994, and Wal-Mart as
the most-admired company today,

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.730
in terms of the larger American
economy, what does that mean?
What does that say about the
touchstones of success?

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:45.630
>> Rubbermaid represented an
innovation-oriented high road
towards U.S. competitiveness.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:52.930
I think Wal-Mart represents a
cost-driven, low-price, low road
towards U.S. competitiveness.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:59.730
And, in a sense, they're two
dramatically different styles in
which the U.S. economy can be
organized.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:06.900
I think the Wal-Mart model is
winning out.
>> Good morning, associates.
I need all available

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:13.030
associates...
>> SMITH: Back at the
supercenter in Bentonville,
employees gather for the morning

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:20.630
meeting, a daily ritual at 5,000
Wal-Mart stores all over the
world.
It's part of the Wal-Mart

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:27.030
culture.
>> Good morning, everybody.
>> Good morning, Matt.
Whoo!

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:33.430
>> Is everybody doing all right?
Okay, let's talk about sales.
We had a good day yesterday.
We're up 6.5%.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:41.560
Meat was up 19.2% yesterday.
>> SMITH: It's a pep rally
around Sam Walton's low-cost,
low-price formula for success.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:49.200
(<i> applause</i> )
>> Way to go.
Who else has got an item?
>> 88 cents, has an 85.23%

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.200
markup.
Great item.
Great item.
>> All right.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:57.400
>> They're $1.50 for 24, and a
30% markup.
>> All right.
Good item.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:05.400
>> 96 cents socks.
>> SMITH: Pay close attention.
What they're talking about is
how Wal-Mart pulls in millions

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:13.030
of shoppers by touting what it
calls the "opening price point."
>> Then we have Simply Basic
socks for your dollar, with 94

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:17.100
cents.
>> Awesome.
>> We sell... in all the colors
we sell about 60 pairs a week.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:22.730
>> Okay.
>> SMITH: Opening price points
are the rock-bottom prices that
Wal-Mart showcases in special

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:31.800
displays-- the $9.14 saucepan,
trick-or-treat jack-o-lanterns
for 78 cents.
>> The opening price point is

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.330
clearly a foundation of who we
are and how we interact with our
customers.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:42.900
We feel that they need to have
the best product, the best value
at the best price we can
achieve.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:51.760
>> It's the heart of Wal-Mart's
pricing strategy.
Wal-Mart puts tremendous amount
of planning, organization, and

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:58.700
thinking into what their opening
price points are going to be
based on last year's sales,
based on customer requests.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:07.060
>> SMITH: Every line of goods
has an opening price point, the
cheapest item in the line.
For example, this $29.87

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:13.730
microwave oven.
It's a good price, but it's also
the bait to lure customers to
that department.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:18.630
>> Just to get you in.
You look at that and you think,
"Wow, what a great price."
And then they got you, because

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:24.300
you walk about ten more feet and
you see the item you really want
in that same category.
Then you buy that item, but it's

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:30.460
not going to be, probably, the
lowest price in town.
>> SMITH: So are you saying that
the opening price is the lowest

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:36.100
price and actually will beat the
competition, but maybe other
items in the same category
aren't necessarily the lowest

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.860
price?
>> Oh, absolutely not.
Once you walk past that opening
price point, they got you,

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:46.860
because you've already formed
the perception that everything
in that department is the lowest
price in town.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:52.330
>> SMITH: And maybe it's not.
>> No, it's not.
No, I can tell you it's not.
I can tell you from experience

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:53.660
it's not.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:07.160
>> SMITH: Back in the 1950s, Sam
Walton dreamed up the idea of an
eye-popping opening price point.
>> Sam had an old Ford pickup

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:13.530
truck, and he'd go down the road
and buy ladies' panties and sell
them at a ridiculous low price,
you know, ten for a buck, or

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:21.400
something like that.
>> SMITH: And it worked.
Sam got a jump on bigger rivals
by targeting territory they

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:28.600
ignored, building his early
stores near small towns in the
south.
>> One thing you have to think

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:35.700
about in the history about us is
that we are a company that
hasn't been that long ago that
we were a regional player.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:41.900
What we found is we had to
compete with, as a regional
player, those that were national
players.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:48.260
How do we do that?
We had to go overseas to find
products in some cases.
In the '70s and '80s, Sam Walton

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:54.160
would travel overseas looking
for goods that would sell in our
stores.
>> SMITH: Despite Wal-Mart's

00:23:54.160 --> 00:24:02.330
much publicized Buy American
campaign in the late '80s, low-
cost imports from Asia became a
vital component of Wal-Mart's

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:10.100
low opening price point
strategy.
>> They were more single-minded
in terms of global cost cutting

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:17.860
and internal efficiency than any
other U.S. retailer.
And that helps us understand how
and why they were able to pass

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:25.730
companies like K-Mart and Sears
that were the early leaders in
U.S. retailing and offshore
sourcing.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:32.560
>> There was a lot of talk about
those companies being asleep at
the wheel, being fat, dumb, and
happy, you know.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:37.000
And we didn't want to be fat,
dumb, and happy.
We wanted to be aggressive.
>> SMITH: And they were

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:48.600
aggressive.
From 38 stores in 1970, Wal-Mart
grew to 276 in 1980, and
mushroomed to 1,500 in 1990.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:57.060
In 1991, it overtook its long
established rivals to become the
nation's biggest retailer.
Then, surprisingly, Wal-Mart

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:06.100
began having trouble.
In 1992, Sam Walton died, and a
year later, with the economy
slow and sales sluggish, Wal-

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:11.100
Mart's stock price slumped
badly.
>> And Wal-Mart got very
nervous.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:17.800
It got lower and lower and
approaching that $20 mark.
And that $20 mark seemed to be
the, like, the threshold.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:24.600
"If it gets down below $20, it's
going to be a panic."
>> SMITH: Wal-Mart's new
management needed to crank up

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:32.630
sales and profits, and they hit
on a way to do both.
>> I saw this, as a store
manager, an influx, a giant

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:39.300
influx of imported merchandise
coming in.
The stores were inundated with
inventory.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:44.330
Inundated.
I mean, we had so much of this
cheap crap floating around the
store, we didn't know what to do

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.730
with it.
>> SMITH: Lehman was so
overwhelmed with merchandise
that he called a vice president

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:55.630
at Wal-Mart headquarters to ask
what was going on.
>> He said, "Jon, you know, we
got to bring our profit in for

00:25:55.630 --> 00:26:01.100
the quarter, for the month, for
the year.
And you know our stock price is
declining.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:06.700
And you do understand, Jon, that
these imports have a high
margin, a high markup, and
they're going to help your

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:11.900
profit-and-loss statement.
They're going to help the
company's profit-and-loss
statement."

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:17.560
>> SMITH: The impact was
dramatic and immediate.
>> The margins on the
merchandise that were coming in

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:23.200
from the Wal-Mart import items
were incredible.
>> SMITH: Like what?
>> 60%, 70%, 80%.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:29.300
You know, incredible.
>> SMITH: Compared with what
from American-made items?
>> Well, compare that to an

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:37.830
electric razor that you might be
making 20% on or 18% on or 22%.
>> SMITH: So, you're saying that
Wal-Mart is making much bigger

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:44.100
profits on these items that are
made in China or these low-wage
countries.
Is that right?

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.030
>> That's absolutely right.

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:53.530
>> SMITH: By the late '90s, Wal-
Mart was dependent on low-cost
Asian imports, and it began
pushing its American suppliers

00:26:53.530 --> 00:27:04.860
to follow Wal-Mart to Asia.
>> Their message to us,
surprisingly, is: there's a
broad market out there.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:11.300
If you want to focus on the
lowest-cost part of the market,
it's obvious that you can't do
that in the United States.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:17.960
>> SMITH: So if you want to play
in that 25% of the Wal-Mart
market, you got to be in a very
low-cost place-- China or

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:23.630
someplace like China.
>> That's correct.
But China, practically speaking,
is it.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:29.100
>> SMITH: And a number of the
suppliers have told us that they
have felt real strong,
particularly opening price point

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:36.830
pressure from Wal-Mart that has
effectively forced them to make
decisions to move overseas,
specifically to China.

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:41.530
>> I don't know that that is a
common practice.
I don't know... I can't even
confirm that that happened.

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:50.200
I suspect that this is a
legitimate occurrence that
you're citing, and there may be
some validity to that.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:56.830
The sad truth is, because of
perhaps the pressure on price
because of this opening price
point initiative that we and

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:05.960
others have, and because the
pressure of costs on the other
side, that it's difficult to
make that... make ends meet, if

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:13.400
you're a business, by staying
here.
>> SMITH: You, as a producer of
socks for 30, 40 years, are you

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:18.960
now going to find that you need
to put a production facility in
China?
>> Absolutely.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:26.400
For us to remain a viable
company over the long run, we
know we have to compete.

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:33.460
>> Wal-Mart basically tells its
suppliers, "We need to get those
products at 30% lower price.
You need to move to Asia.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:38.200
You need to move to China,
because that will meet our
bottom-line price figures."

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:47.860
>> SMITH: Wal-Mart was
capitalizing on a watershed
moment on the world stage:
America's embrace of trade with

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:55.760
China in the late '90s.
With corporate America hailing
China as the new economic
frontier, President Clinton

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:02.200
signed a permanent trade
agreement with the Chinese.
>> Our administration has
negotiated an agreement which

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:11.400
will open China's markets to
American products made on
American soil, everything from
corn to chemicals to computers.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:22.100
>> The picture painted was that
China was a big, emerging market
for U.S. exports, and that U.S.
workers and also U.S. companies,

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:28.530
companies that made their
products here, could profit
tremendously from the opening of
trade flows with such an

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:33.860
enormous country like China.
After all, it had 1.2 billion
people.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:47.600
>> SMITH: To see firsthand how
the promise of a vast new market
for America was playing out, I
headed for China and the heart

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:59.160
of its new industrial
revolution: Shenzhen, South
China's miracle city.
20 years ago, this was all rice

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:06.400
fields.
Today, it's a sophisticated city
of seven million, its
astonishing rise orchestrated by

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:14.660
China's leaders and ignited by a
Chinese currency devaluation in
the mid-'90s that dramatically
lowered its export prices.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:21.060
>> It's the opening of China.
China is a communist country
and, for the longest time, we
had closed doors.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:26.530
And when they opened up to
Western businesses, the
floodgates opened, basically,
and it's something that you just

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:34.900
can't stop.
>> SMITH: The boom seemed
endless.
North of Shenzhen, I found an

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:41.500
entrepreneur who was among the
first to spot opportunity in the
new China.
>> Well, these are the products

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:47.260
we make.
This gives you some idea...
>> SMITH: Australian Donald Hay
came to South China 20 years

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:53.330
ago.
>> I was in this part of the
world, and I could see.
I saw the cheap products come

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:58.930
out of Japan, and I saw then
that market went to Korea, then
it went to Taiwan.
I said, "Hold it, hold it, hold

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:04.500
it.
The next one's China.
I got to get here."
>> SMITH: The backbone of

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:12.130
China's new industrial might is
the flood of young Chinese
pouring into this industrial
province, an area no bigger than

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:23.630
Missouri now teeming with more
than 40 million migrant workers.
They come to work and live at
the factories.

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:30.630
At Hay's company, Hayco, they
make $100 month, or about 50
cents an hour.
Other companies pay as little as

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:40.900
25 or 30 cents an hour.
>> They want to work.
They want to earn the money.
They want to get forward.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:48.930
And they will do anything to
move forward.
>> SMITH: Today, Hayco supplies
electric toothbrushes and home

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:56.860
cleaning products to big
American companies like 3M,
Procter & Gamble, and Wal-Mart.
>> What's happened is the world

00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:01.630
has come here as a marketplace.
It's like a supermarket for
manufacturing today.

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:08.830
And the quality is up to world
standards, in a long way past
world standards.
And that's just what's happened

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:10.360
in southern China.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:19.560
>> SMITH: All across the region,
I saw evidence of the mass
corporate migration into China--
highways lined with factories

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:28.000
like airport hangars.
Hundreds of billions of dollars
in Western investment have
poured into China in the past 20

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:38.360
years.
And Wal-Mart is here, too.
It has 35 supercenters in China.
And behind one of them, here in

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:46.260
Shenzhen, I found Wal-Mart's
Global Procurement Center, a
huge buying operation tapping
directly into China's new

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:55.300
workshop of the world.
>> I interviewed people in Wal-
Mart's Global Procurement Center
in Shenzhen, and I asked them

00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:02.500
about the total number of Wal-
Mart suppliers.
And I was told that Wal-Mart has
6,000 global suppliers.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:11.800
80% of those suppliers are in
China.
>> SMITH: Several hundred
employees work at the

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:19.760
procurement center, keeping the
import pipeline full.
>> Wal-Mart gives Chinese
suppliers the specifications for

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:25.400
Wal-Mart products, and they
teach those suppliers how to
meet those specifications.
They have to do with price.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:30.630
They have to do with quality.
They have to do with delivery
schedule.
So in a sense, Chinese suppliers

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:37.930
learn how to export to the U.S.
market through large retailers
like Wal-Mart.
>> SMITH: The Chinese suppliers

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:43.830
also learned just how tough Wal-
Mart can be.
>> Wal-Mart is... they are very
shrewd people.

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:52.100
They know that they have the
volume orders behind them and
they can go into a factory and
almost demand... "These are my

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:57.130
lists of demands, and this is
what I need."
>> SMITH: Kenneth Chan is a Hong
Kong entrepreneur who used to

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:03.130
supply Wal-Mart.
I've even heard sometimes that
they will call in three or four
manufacturers into one of their

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:07.460
little negotiating booths and
auction them off and say, "This
is what we want."
>> Yeah, the big reverse auction

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:12.460
kind of thing where they bid the
price as low as possible.
>> SMITH: What do they do?
>> Basically, they bring people

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:21.530
into their offices and just put
a product in front of you and
ask you to... everybody to bid
their cost on the product.

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:29.000
And it's very high pressure.
>> SMITH: Have you ever been in
that situation where you had to
bid, three or four people in the

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.660
same room?
>> Yeah, I have.
One of the things that I was
involved in, they were

00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:42.160
inexpensive, less than... they
were probably, at the most,
maybe less than a dollar.
>> SMITH: So they're pounding

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:47.900
for a few pennies.
>> Yeah, they're only pounding
for, in a lot of cases, just one
penny, in fact.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:52.600
>> SMITH: Now, the argument is
that this is getting a better
deal for the consumer.
Do you buy that or do you say...

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:57.260
>> No, it's getting a better
deal for the retailer or the
importer.
>> SMITH: For the Wal-Mart.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:03.400
>> Yeah, for the Wal-Mart, for
the Targets, whoever does it.
>> SMITH: I'd heard about the
Chinese producing cheap, low-end

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:11.500
consumer goods.
What was striking to me was how
many Chinese companies were
going high-tech.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:21.900
You may not have heard of TCL,
but you've seen their TVs and
maybe bought them, marketed
under brand names like Philips

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:29.730
and RCA.
And you'll be hearing more from
them soon.
They have a wide range of modern

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:36.930
electronic products, and they've
just merged with French
electronics giant Thomson.
Together, they're now the

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.530
largest TV maker in the world.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:51.900
>> (<i> translated</i> ): 99% of our
exports are for North America
and Europe, where we make a
large part of our profit.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.300
We need to fulfill the demand of
our foreign customers.

00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:03.030
>> SMITH: And only one U.S.
customer, it turns out, really
matters to TCL.
>> (<i> translated</i> ): Selling to

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:12.830
Wal-Mart accounts for almost all
our sales to the U.S. market.
Wal-Mart keeps a very low
inventory and a fast turnaround,

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:20.330
which forces us to speed up our
production to catch up with the
international market.
>> SMITH: It was a familiar

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:29.830
refrain.
I heard it everywhere: ramping
up production, supplying Wal-
Mart, shipping to America,

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:39.030
And at Shenzhen's main port, I
saw a river of exports.
Ten years ago, this was all
barren land.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:49.330
Today, Shenzhen is on the verge
of becoming the third busiest
port in the world, and Wal-Mart
is one of its biggest customers.

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:56.700
>> Wal-Mart has a very close
relationship with China.
China is the largest exporter to
the U.S. economy in virtually

00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:04.900
all consumer goods categories.
Wal-Mart is the largest retailer
in the U.S. economy in virtually
all consumer goods categories.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.600
>> SMITH: It sounds like a
commercial marriage made in
heaven.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:19.330
>> Wal-Mart and China are a
joint venture, and both are
determined to dominate the U.S.
economy as much as they can.

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:29.100
>> SMITH: Wal-Mart estimates
that it imports $15 billion of
Chinese goods every year, and
maybe a lot more.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:34.230
You've mentioned a figure of $15
billion, direct and indirect
imports.
Others have given us higher

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:38.830
estimates-- well into the
twenties and maybe $30 billion.
Is that possible?

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:44.760
>> I think it could... it's
possible it could be higher and
it could be lower.
The other thing you have to

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:49.160
remember is that we're growing
pretty significantly in terms of
sales.

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:55.060
So next year it will be higher,
and the year after that it's
likely to be higher, as well.
>> Wal-Mart is providing a

00:37:55.060 --> 00:38:04.530
gateway into the American
economy for overseas suppliers
in China and elsewhere, and it's
doing it on a scale that has...

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:05.960
is unprecedented.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.500
>> SMITH: Well,<i> Cosco,</i> that's a
Chinese ship, a Chinese ship,
yeah.
And a Japanese ship here.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:23.800
>> But they're all carrying
Chinese cargo.
>> SMITH: At the other end of
the pipeline, I visited the port

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:32.230
of Long Beach in California.
I wanted to see how Washington's
promise of massive American-made
exports to China was working

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:37.800
out.
The port's communications
director is Yvonne Smith.
What are they shipping in and

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:43.330
what are we shipping back?
>> Well, we're bringing in
consumer products.
We're bringing in about $36

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:53.000
billion worth of machinery,
toys, clothing, footwear.
>> SMITH: $36 billion right here
in Long Beach?

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.430
>> $36 billion comes through
Long Beach from China alone.
Consumer products.
>> SMITH: And what are we

00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:05.700
shipping back?
>> We're shipping out about $3
billion worth of raw materials.
We export cotton; we bring in

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:13.660
clothing.
We export hides; we bring in
shoes.
We export scrap metal; we bring

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:18.700
back machinery.
>> SMITH: So, they're doing all
the... we're like a third-world
country.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:28.360
>> We're exporting waste paper,
containers full of waste paper;
we bring back cardboard boxes
with products inside them.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:36.130
>> SMITH: Add it all up and the
U.S. had a record $120 billion
trade deficit with China last
year, and it's headed even

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:37.730
higher this year.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:47.400
>> The myth of an enormous and
growing China market wound up
locking the United States into a
trading partnership with China

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:51.360
that had to benefit China much
more than it could benefit us.

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:56.600
>> SMITH: Because?
>> And the reason was China
would always be able to sell the
United States much more goods

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:04.830
than Americans could sell to
Chinese, because Americans had
the incomes that are needed to
buy Chinese products.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:11.030
Chinese consumers overwhelmingly
don't have the incomes needed to
buy American products.
>> SMITH: So the whole idea was

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:14.230
wrong.
>> It was completely wrong.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:19.360
>> When you look at the growth
of the trade deficit with China,
you could say that a very
conservative estimate is that we

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:25.460
have lost more than a million
jobs to China since the early
1990s.
>> I think it's impossible to

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:31.760
say that we've lost a million
jobs to China.
Trade policy or trade flows, one
way or another, don't have an

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.360
effect on overall employment
numbers.

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:40.300
They affect the kinds of jobs we
have.
And so some number of jobs have
definitely been eliminated

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:46.060
because of Chinese competition.
Another... Elsewhere in the
economy, other jobs have been
created because of Chinese

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:51.400
competition.
Because American consumers have
saved at Wal-Mart buying Chinese
goods, they've got more money in

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.900
their pocket to buy something
else, which creates business
opportunities for those other
businesses, which means they

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:01.830
hire workers they would not have
hired otherwise.
The net effect, most economists
think, is a wash.

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:06.000
>> Theoretically, the gains from
trade offset the losses from
trade.

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:12.900
But nothing says that there are
more winners than losers, and
nothing says that for the bottom
three-fourths of America that

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:18.530
they are net gainers.
In fact, I believe that most
people have been losers from
trade.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:36.960
>> SMITH: The impact of China's
export boom has been felt all
across the U.S. in towns like
Circleville, Ohio, population

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:50.700
13,000, a Norman Rockwell kind
of town with its farms and
factories-- a solid citadel of
middle class America.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:58.330
Former Republican Mayor Ron
Wunsch has lived in Circleville
all his adult life.
>> The community basically

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:06.100
generated its livelihood off of
the industry that came into the
community, came in in the 1940s
and 1950s.

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:13.300
Thomson Consumer Electronics was
the last large organization to
join back in the 1970s.
>> SMITH: So you had good living

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:19.700
standards, good jobs.
>> Good jobs, good living
standards, and good people in
the community.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:25.730
>> SMITH: The French firm,
Thomson, which manufactures TV
sets, had the largest plant in
town, and it was a top

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:27.030
performer.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:35.160
>> The Circleville plant in its
heyday-- probably around 1999,
2000-- was producing about ten
million pieces a year for the

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.100
production of television sets.
They made the glass components.

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:45.360
About a thousand workers, highly
motivated, highly productive.
Very efficient plants.
And at the time, it was one of

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:50.630
the most profitable contributors
to Thomson's corporate bottom
line.
>> SMITH: Steve Ratcliff was

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:58.700
among 1,000 workers who rode the
economic wave with Thomson.
As a machine operator, he made
up to $59,000 a year with

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:05.260
overtime.
>> I've done this job for the
last 30, almost 31 years, and
it's become my life.

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:12.360
And it's the only thing I've
ever known in my adult working
career was that job.
>> SMITH: But from 2002 onward,

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:19.700
the tide went out.
Plants in Circleville started
closing, and the big Thomson
plant suddenly faced sharp

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:26.030
foreign competition.
>> We started to see more
finished Chinese components
coming into the market.

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:30.700
A few brands come to mind like
Apex.
They were selling at prices that
most people couldn't even

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:37.160
manufacture at the U.S.
And they're being sold at the
same place we all buy TVs-- Best
Buy, Circuit City, Wal-Mart, and

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:44.760
Sears.
And, you know, all of a sudden,
you had this end pressure on
the retail price driven largely

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:52.160
by the Chinese producers.
>> SMITH: And oddly, Mayor
Wunsch says, the Thomson plant
ran into big trouble not just

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:56.160
because of the Chinese, but also
an American company.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:06.300
>> In 2003, they lost a sizeable
portion of their total
production orders from a
particular customer.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:12.900
>> SMITH: Sanyo?
>> Sanyo, I believe.
>> SMITH: They lost the Sanyo
contract because of what?

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:23.060
>> My understanding, based on
what I was told, was that an
end-use retailer told the Sanyo
people what they were going to

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:26.800
pay for the TV.
>> SMITH: And who was that
retailer?
>> My understanding is that that

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:31.230
was Wal-Mart.
>> Wal-Mart is going to say, "If
you want our space, you're going
to have to match our price or

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:37.560
figure something else to do."
And so it forces a supplier like
Sanyo to go back upstream to the
tube-- and in our case, glass

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:42.000
manufacturers-- to look for
price concessions.
But sometimes they're not there.
>> SMITH: So if they're not

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:49.400
there, then they go to China.
>> Then they go to China or
wherever they can to compete.
>> SMITH: Foreign competition

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:58.260
hit other TV makers, too.
In east Tennessee, I came across
the very last American-owned TV
maker desperately fighting to

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:03.630
hang on.
>> Well, it's a constant
struggle to survive.
I mean, it's a very competitive

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:08.030
market.
Right now, we've got about 700,
750...
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:15.300
Tom Hopson is President of Five
Rivers Electronics, an assembler
of brand names like Philips,
Samsung, and RCA.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:25.300
With foreign imports dominating
the small TV market, Hopson
concentrated on high-end, big-
screen sets, but even that was

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.230
no protection from the Chinese.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:37.960
>> By the year 2003, they were,
like, increased 1,100% in
imports.
So, they just grew at an amazing

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.130
rate.
All of a sudden, they weren't
here.

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:47.400
They were shipping, you know,
maybe 100,000.
Now, they're shipping millions
and millions of televisions all

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:54.200
of a sudden from China.
>> SMITH: In three short years,
Chinese TV makers had grabbed
one-third of the high-end

00:45:54.200 --> 00:46:02.800
market, about $350 million of
business.
But Hopson was convinced he was
up against more than just free

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:08.460
trade.
>> You know, we're here to
create jobs for our people in
Greenville, Tennessee.

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:15.500
And on a fair, level playing
field, if we can't compete, then
we go out of business like
anyone else.

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:21.900
But if it's unfair and it's
illegal and someone's doing
something to damage and put
these people out of jobs, we're

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:26.800
going to try to do something to
keep these jobs.
>> SMITH: Hopson turned to
Washington.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:33.700
He filed a trade complaint,
charging the Chinese with
dumping high-end TVs onto the
American market, selling at

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:38.400
below free market cost.
>> It's not fair trade.
It's not free trade.

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:47.900
The Chinese are pricing their
products in a manner contrary to
the obligations they undertook
when they joined the World Trade

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.030
Organization a few years ago.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:57.130
The Chinese system has built-in
advantages that no one else in
the world has.
Their currency is undervalued by

00:46:57.130 --> 00:47:06.160
we estimate about 40%.
Their workers are not treated
fairly in terms of worker
rights.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:14.000
The government provides
subsidies to Chinese producers
at preferential interest rates
that may not even have to be

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:21.360
repaid.
It's a rigged system.
>> SMITH: Chinese TV makers
vigorously fought the case,

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:30.160
including TCL.
Tom Hopson was prepared to take
on the Chinese, but stunned at
whom else he had to fight.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:35.400
Which side did Wal-Mart come
down on?
>> Well, Wal-Mart chose the side
of the Chinese, and basically

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:46.130
Wal-Mart spent a lot of time and
effort at the International
Trade Commission hearings
testifying against us and our

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:52.430
case.
>> SMITH: When I asked a Wal-
Mart spokesman, he said he could
not address this specific case.

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:57.460
On the question of dumping, does
Wal-Mart have a position on
dumping cases?
>> I think we should weigh in if

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:06.260
we feel a need, if there is an
issue that we see that perhaps
needs a perspective from the
retail trade ourselves, or if

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:12.360
we're asked to.
>> SMITH: And do you see Wal-
Mart's position weighing in on
behalf of the American

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:17.500
manufacturers or on behalf of
the foreign companies that are
supplying?
>> I think it has to be a case-

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:24.700
by-case basis.
>> Why would an American company
fight American companies and
American jobs unless it was for

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:34.460
their own profit?
I don't understand that.
Why would Wal-Mart and other
companies actually testify to

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:40.860
support jobs in China instead of
American jobs, unless there was
some benefit to them?
>> SMITH: Last April, Five

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:47.460
Rivers won its case.
The International Trade
Commission determined that
Chinese producers were illegally

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:54.830
dumping high-end TVs on the U.S.
market.
It imposed new import duties,
effectively raising Chinese

00:48:54.830 --> 00:49:02.360
prices and making Five Rivers
more competitive.
If you had had a bad case or
you'd lost this case, would you

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:06.600
have shut down?
>> Absolutely.
There's no doubt in my mind that
if we had lost this case, this

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:14.400
factory would not be in
business.
>> SMITH: But it was already too
late for other U.S.-based TV

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:22.900
suppliers, like that Thomson
plant in Circleville, Ohio.
Last May, the plant was finally
shut down.

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:26.800
Did Thomson say that it was
shutting the plant down because
of competition from China?

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:34.560
>> Exactly.
They basically told us that they
could buy the glass from their
competitors coming out of China

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:40.530
cheaper than what we could
actually make it for at our
plant.

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:47.660
>> SMITH: Suddenly, a thousand
workers like Steve Ratcliff lost
the jobs of a lifetime.
>> You kind of feel like you've

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:52.400
been a failure in a way.
You worry a lot.
Like I said, I worry about
whether or not I'll be able to

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:59.900
find work with, you know,
comparable wages and benefits,
and just what the future will
be.

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:06.560
>> Job opportunities for the
kids coming out of high school
in this area today are very much
lower than they were ten years

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:12.030
ago.
There are a lot of people in
this community who have families
that the father worked 30 or 40

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:17.130
years at a plant, then the son
got employed, and a third
generation that has been
employed at some of the plants.

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:21.200
And those are gone now.
And there's no opportunity for
that.
>> SMITH: What are those high

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:33.630
school kids going to do?
>> We don't know.
We don't know.
>> SMITH: Ironically, it may be

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:42.530
Wal-Mart to the rescue.
One new job opportunity in
Circleville will soon be a new
Wal-Mart supercenter that just

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:51.060
broke ground on a patch of Ohio
farmland right next door to the
now vacant Thomson TV plant.
How would you feel about working

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:56.460
for Wal-Mart?
>> I don't know where I'd really
want to work for Wal-Mart or
not, to be honest.

00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:02.530
>> SMITH: Why not?
>> Wal-Mart's a big contributor,
as far as bringing in a lot of
the foreign products, the

00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:07.700
cheaper-made products and so
forth.
And quite frankly, that's some
of what's going on right now

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:13.760
with what put us out of
business, is the foreign
competition.
>> SMITH: For those who lost

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:22.860
jobs at Thomson, Wal-Mart jobs
represent a steep cut in pay--
almost half of the $15 to $16 an
hour they made at Thomson, and a

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:30.030
far cry from the pension, health
care, and job security benefits
long the norm in U.S. industry.

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:37.060
>> Joseph Schumpeter, who was an
Austrian economist, famous, used
the phrase "creative
destruction."

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:42.860
What he meant was, that one mode
of production, one form of
capitalist economics comes to
the fore.

00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:50.430
It's more efficient, it's more
powerful, it destroys,
literally, other forms of
production, other firms.

00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:55.830
And that's what Wal-Mart has
done.
It has discovered, with this
low-wage model, with a

00:51:55.830 --> 00:52:03.630
technologically efficient... its
global reach, it is a sort of
new model of world capitalism,
really, beginning in America and

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:10.000
the rest of the world.
And it is destroying--
creatively, but nevertheless,
destroying-- competitors and

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:23.760
really other ways of thinking
about the way the world works.

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:29.530

for you is, is Wal-Mart good for
America?
Is this strategy of Wal-Mart

00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:30.960
good for America?

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:37.260

America.
Wal-Mart is doing what America
is all about, the American

market economy is all about,
which is producing things
consumers want to buy.

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:47.600
And Wal-Mart is offering
consumers a wide range of goods
at rock-bottom prices, and
therefore, it is meeting the

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:13.000
And the dynamics that create
