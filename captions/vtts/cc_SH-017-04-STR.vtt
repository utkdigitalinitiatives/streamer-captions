00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.170


2
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.270
O blessedbreeding sun,

3
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.930
draw from the earth rottenhumidity;

4
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.200
below thy sister's orb,infect the air!

5
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.670
Twin brothers of one womb,

6
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.330
whose procreation,residence, and birth

7
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.500
scarce is dividant,

8
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.430
touch them with severalfortunes;

9
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.700
the greater scorns thelesser.

10
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.700
Not nature, to whom allsores lay siege,

11
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.370
can bear great fortune,

12
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.470
but by contempt of nature.

13
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.630
Raise me this beggar, denyit that lord;

14
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.800
the senator shall bearcontempt hereditary,

15
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.500
the beggar, native honor.

16
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.130
It is the pasture lards,the brother's sides,

17
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.530
the want that makes himlean.

18
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.900
Who dares, who dares,

19
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.970
in purity of manhood standupright,

20
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.370
and say, "This man's aflatterer"?

21
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.130
If one be, so are theyall;

22
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.430
for every grise of fortuneis smoothed by that below.

23
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.730
The learned pate ducks tothe golden fool.

24
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.100
All is oblique;

25
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.670
there's nothing level inour cursed natures,

26
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.470
but direct villainy.

27
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.000
Therefore, be abhorred

28
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.800
all feasts, societies,throngs of men.

29
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:05.200
His semblable, yea,himself, Timon disdains.

30
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.130
Destruction fang mankind!

31
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.030
Earth, yield me roots.

32
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.400
Who seeks for better ofthee,

33
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.030
sauce his palate with thymost operant poison.

34
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.400
What is here?

35
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.670
Gold?

36
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.470
Yellow, glittering,precious gold?

37
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.800
No, gods, I'm no idlevotarist!

38
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.870
Roots, you clear heavens!

39
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.870
Thus much of this willmake black white,

40
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.100
foul fair, wrong right,base noble,

41
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.270
old young, coward valiant.

42
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.770
Ha, you gods!

43
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.870
What this?

44
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:27.300
Why, this will lug your priestsand servants from your sides,

45
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.730
pluck pillows from beneathstout men's heads.

46
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.070
This yellow slave willknit and break religions,

47
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.500
bless the accursed, makethe hoar leprosy adored,

48
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.400
place thieves and give themtitle, knee and approbation

49
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.170
with senators on thebench.

50
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.930
Why, this is it that makes thewappened widow wed again;

51
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.170
she whom the spital-houseand ulcerous sores

52
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.430
would cast the gorge at,

53
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.330
this embalms and spices tothe April day again.

54
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.030
Come, damned earth, thoucommon whore of mankind,

55
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.200
that puttest odds amongthe route of nations,

56
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.970
I will make thee do thyright nature.

57
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.100
Ha!

58
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.100
A drum?

59
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.400
Thou art quick, but yetI'll bury thee.

60
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.530
Thou go, strong thief,

61
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.870
when gouty keepers of theecannot stand.

62
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.970
Nay, stay thou out forearnest.

63
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.870
What art thou there?

64
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.500
Speak.

65
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.930
A beast, as thou art.

66
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.400
The canker gnaw thy heart,

67
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.600
for showing me again theeyes of man.

68
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.670
What is thy name?

69
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.870
Is man so hateful to theethat art thyself a man?

70
00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:03.800
I am Misanthropos and hatemankind.

71
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.800
For thy part, I do wishthou wert a dog

72
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.230
that I might love theesomething.

73
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.100
I know thee well;

74
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.630
but in thy fortunes amunlearned and strange.

75
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.400
I know thee too;

76
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.900
and more than that I knowthee, I not desire to know.

77
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.100
Follow thy drum;

78
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:25.000
with man's blood paint theground, gules, gules.

79
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.270
Religious canons, civillaws are cruel;

80
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.500
what should war be?

81
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.670
This fell whore of thine hathin her more destruction

82
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.570
than thy sword, for allher cherubim look.

83
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.900
Oh, thy lips rot off!

84
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.330
I'll not kiss thee;

85
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.800
then the rot returns tothine own lips again.

86
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.270
How came the noble Timonto this change?

87
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.500
As the moon does, bywanting light to give.

88
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.170
But then renew I couldnot, like the moon;

89
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.000
there were no suns toborrow of.

90
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Noble Timon, whatfriendship may I do thee?

91
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.370
None, but to maintain myopinion.

92
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.930
What is it, Timon?

93
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.470
Promise me friendship, butperform none.

94
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.500
If thou wilt not promise,the gods plague thee,

95
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.900
for thou art a man.

96
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.770
If thou dost perform,confound thee,

97
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.200
for thou art a man!

98
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.200
I have heard in some sortof thy miseries.

99
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.230
Thou sawest them, when Ihad prosperity.

100
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.000
I see them now;

101
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.670
then was a blessed time.

102
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.230
As thine is now, held witha brace of harlots.

103
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.370
Is this the Athenianminion

104
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.970
the world has voiced soregardfully?

105
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.130
Art thou Timandra?

106
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.200
Yes.

107
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.630
Be a whore still.

108
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.200
They love thee not thatuse thee;

109
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.830
give them diseases, leavingwith thee their lust.

110
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.030
Make use of thy salthours.

111
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.770
Season the slaves for tubsand baths;

112
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.730
bring down rose-cheeked youthto the tub-fast and diet.

113
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.830
Hang thee, monster!

114
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.200
Pardon him, sweetTimandra;

115
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.930
his wits are drowned andlost in his calamities.

116
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.770
I have but little gold oflate, brave Timon,

117
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.630
the want whereof dothdaily make revolt

118
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.300
in my penurious band.

119
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.400
I have heard, and grieved,how cursed Athens,

120
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.700
mindless of thy worth,

121
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.170
forgetting thy great deeds,when neighbor states,

122
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.470
but for thy sword andfortune, trod upon them

123
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.030
I prithee, beat thy drum,and get thee gone.

124
00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.500
I am thy friend, and pitythee, dear Timon.

125
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.900
How dost thou pity himwhom thou dost trouble?

126
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.800
I had rather be alone!

127
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.200
Why, fare thee well.

128
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.270
Here is some gold forthee.

129
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.730
Keep it; I cannot eat it.

130
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.000
When I have laid proudAthens on a heap

131
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Warrest thou againstAthens?

132
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.470
Ay, Timon, and have cause.

133
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.400
The gods confound them allin thy conquest;

134
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.530
and thee after, when thouhast conquered!

135
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:47.600
Why me, Timon?

136
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.700
That, by killing ofvillains,

137
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.000
thou was born to conquermy country.

138
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.100
Put up thy gold.

139
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.100
Go on

140
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.900
here's gold

141
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.930
go on;

142
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.030
be as a planetary plague,

143
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.000
when Jove will over somehigh-viced city

144
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.170
hang his poison in thesick air.

145
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.030
Let not thy sword skipone.

146
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.630
Pity not honored age forhis white beard;

147
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.300
he is an usurer.

148
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.600
Strike me the counterfeitmatron;

149
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.100
it is her habit only thatis honest,

150
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.600
herself's a bawd.

151
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.970
Let not the virgin's cheek makesoft thy trenchant sword;

152
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.300
for those milk paps, thatthrough the window-bars

153
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.400
bore at men's eyes,

154
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.870
are not within the leaf ofpity writ,

155
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.430
but set them down horribletraitors.

156
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.100
Spare not the babe, whosedimpled smiles

157
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.900
from fools exhaust theirmercy;

158
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.300
think it a bastard,

159
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.870
whom the oracle hathdoubtfully pronounced

160
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.300
the throat shall cut,

161
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.970
and mince it sans remorse.

162
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.230
Swear against objects;

163
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.500
put armor on thine earsand on thine eyes;

164
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.230
whose proof, nor yells ofmothers, maids, nor babes,

165
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.900
nor sight of priests inholy vestments bleeding,

166
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.830
shall pierce a jot.

167
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.300
There's gold to pay thysoldiers.

168
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.300
Make large confusion;

169
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.930
and, thy fury spent,confounded be thyself!

170
00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.730
Speak not, be gone.

171
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.800
Hast thou gold yet?

172
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.830
I'll take the gold thougivest me,

173
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.300
not all thy counsel.

174
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:13.800
Dost thou, or dost thou not,heaven's curse upon thee!

175
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.230
Give us some gold, goodTimon.

176
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.770
Hast thou more?

177
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.270
Enough to make a whoreforswear her trade,

178
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.700
and to make whores,a bawd.

179
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.030
Hold up, you sluts, youraprons mountant.

180
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.870
You are not oathable, although,I know, you'll swear,

181
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.970
terribly swear into strongshudders

182
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.730
and heavenly agues theimmortal gods that hear you

183
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:38.730
spare your oaths, I'lltrust to your conditions.

184
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.670
Be whores still;

185
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.700
and he whose pious breathseeks to convert you,

186
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.770
be strong in whore, allurehim, burn him up;

187
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.970
let your close firepredominate his smoke,

188
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.230
and be no turncoats.

189
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.230
Yet may your pains, sixmonths, be quite contrary.

190
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:04.700
And thatch your poor thin roofswith burthens of the dead

191
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.300
some that were hanged,no matter

192
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.670
wear them, betray withthem.

193
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.300
Whore still;

194
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.130
paint till a horse maymire upon your face,

195
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.830
a pox of wrinkles!

196
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.300
Well, more gold.

197
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.630
What then?

198
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.300
Believe it that we'll doanything for gold.

199
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.230
Consumptions sow in hollowbones of man;

200
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.900
strike their sharp shins,and mar men's spurring.

201
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.370
Crack the lawyer's voice,

202
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.600
that he may never morefalse title plead,

203
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.870
nor sound his quilletsshrilly.

204
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:40.170
Hoar the flamen, who scoldsagainst the quality of flesh,

205
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.330
and not believes himself.

206
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:47.070
Down with the nose, downwith it flat;

207
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.430
take the bridge quite awayof him that,

208
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:53.100
his particular to foresee,smells from the general weal.

209
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.170
Make curled-pateruffians bald;

210
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.670
and let the unscarredbraggarts of the war

211
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.470
derive some pain from you.

212
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.530
Plague all;

213
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.400
that your activity maydefeat and quell

214
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.870
the source of allerection.

215
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.230
There's more gold.

216
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.470
Gold.

217
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.070
Do you damn others, andlet this damn you,

218
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.600
and ditches grave you all.

219
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.500
More counsel with moremoney, bounteous Timon.

220
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.300
More gold and moremischief first;

221
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.730
I've given you earnest.

222
00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.400
Strike up the drum towardsAthens!

223
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.930
Farewell, Timon.

224
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.670
If I thrive well, I'llvisit thee again.

225
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.870
If I hope well, I'll neversee thee more.

226
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.070
I never did thee harm!

227
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.730
Yes, thou spokest wellof me.

228
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:36.770
Callest thou that harm?

229
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.800
Men daily find it.

230
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.270
Get thee gone, and takethy beagles with thee.

231
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.830
We but offend him.

232
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.830
Strike!

233
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:02.030
That nature, being sick ofman's unkindness,

234
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.970
should yet be hungry.

235
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:08.200
Common mother, thou, whosewomb immeasurable,

236
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.170
and infinite breast, teemsand feeds all;

237
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:16.430
whereof thine proud child,arrogant man, is puffed,

238
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:20.100
engenders the black toadand adder blue,

239
00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.470
the gilded newt andeyeless venomed worm,

240
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:28.070
with all the abhorredbirths below crisp heaven

241
00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.800
whereon Hyperion'squickening fire doth shine;

242
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.170
yield him, whom all thehuman sons do hate,

243
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:39.930
from forth thy plenteousbosom, one poor root.

244
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:44.000
Ensear thy fertile andconceptious womb;

245
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.370
let it no more bring outingrateful man.

246
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:55.030
Go great with tigers,dragons, wolves, bears;

247
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.970
teem with new monsters,

248
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.230
whom thy upward face tothe marbled mansion

249
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.200
all above hath neverpresented.

250
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.670
A root!

251
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.600
Dear thanks!

252
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:22.470
Dry up thy marrows, vines,and plough-torn leas;

253
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.300
whereof ingrateful man,

254
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.300
with liquorish draughtsand morsels unctuous,

255
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.170
greases his pure mind,

256
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:33.070
that from it allconsideration slips.

257
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:36.900
More man.

258
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.100
Plague, plague!

259
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:46.030
I was directed hither.

260
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.270
Men report thou dostaffect my manners

261
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.230
and dost use them.

262
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.830
'Tis, then, because thoudost not keep a dog,

263
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.100
whom I would imitate.

264
00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.570
Consumption catch thee!

265
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.400
This is in thee a naturebut infected;

266
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:06.130
a poor unmanly melancholysprung from change of fortune.

267
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.030
Why this spade?

268
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.970
This place?

269
00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.800
This slave-like habit?

270
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.570
And these looks of care?

271
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.930
Thy flatterers yet wearsilk, drink wine, lie soft;

272
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.230
hug their diseasedperfumes,

273
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.400
and have forgot that everTimon was.

274
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.030
No, no, no!

275
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.300
Shame not this place

276
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.030
by putting on the cunningof a carper.

277
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.930
Be thou a flatterer now,

278
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:35.330
and seek to thrive by thatwhich has undone thee.

279
00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.370
Hinge thy knee, and lethis very breath,

280
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.200
whom thoust observe, blowoff thy cap;

281
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.230
praise his most vicious strain,and call it excellent.

282
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.330
Thou wast told thus;

283
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.500
thou gavest thine earslike tapsters

284
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.830
that bid welcome to knavesand all approachers.

285
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.370
'Tis most just that thouturn rascal;

286
00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:01.730
hadst thou wealth again,rascals should have it.

287
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.730
Do not assume my likeness.

288
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.370
Were I like thee, I'dthrow away myself.

289
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:09.370
Thou hast cast away thyself,being like thyself;

290
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.900
a madman so long, now afool.

291
00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.030
What, thinkest that thebleak air,

292
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.700
thy boisterous chamberlain,will put thy shirt on warm?

293
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.730
Will the mossed trees thathave outlived the eagle

294
00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.130
page thy heels, and skipwhere thou pointest out?

295
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.500
Will the cold brook,candied with ice,

296
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.930
caudle thy morning taste,

297
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.130
to cure thy o'er-night'ssurfeit?

298
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.630
Call the creatures whosenaked natures

299
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.730
live in all the spite ofwreakful heaven,

300
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.570
whose bare unhousedtrunks,

301
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.000
to the conflictingelements exposed,

302
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
answer mere nature;

303
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.200
bid them flatter thee;

304
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.200
oh, thou shalt find

305
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.070
A fool of thee.

306
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.270
Depart.

307
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.730
I love thee better nowthan e'er I did.

308
00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.370
I hate thee worse.

309
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:56.370
Why?

310
00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:57.800
Thou flatterest misery.

311
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.030
I flatter not;

312
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.700
but say thou art acaitiff.

313
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.570
Why dost thou seek me out?

314
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.770
To vex thee.

315
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.900
Always a villain's officeor a fool's.

316
00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:10.900
Dost please thyself in it?

317
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:11.900
Ay.

318
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.100
What! A knave too?

319
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.900
If thou didst put thissour-cold habit on

320
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.230
to castigate thy pride,'twere well.

321
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.930
But thou dost itenforcedly;

322
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:25.870
thou wouldst courtier beagain, wert thou not beggar.

323
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.230
Willing misery outlivesencertain pomp,

324
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:30.870
is crowned before.

325
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.270
The one is filling still,never complete;

326
00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:36.100
the other, at high wish.

327
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.230
Best state, contentless,hath a distracted

328
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.200
and most wretched being,

329
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:48.470
worse than the worst,content.

330
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:53.270
Thou shouldst desire todie, being miserable.

331
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:57.270
Not by his breath that ismore miserable.

332
00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:01.530
Thou art a slave, whomfortune's tender arm

333
00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.000
with favor never clasped,

334
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.070
but bred a dog.

335
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:08.230
Hadst thou, like us fromour first swath,

336
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:09.400
proceeded the sweetdegrees

337
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.370
that this brief worldaffords to such

338
00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:13.530
as may the passive drudgesof it freely command,

339
00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:18.030
thou wouldst have drownedthyself in general riot;

340
00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.070
melted down thy youth indifferent beds of lust;

341
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.630
and never learned the icyprecepts of respect,

342
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.930
but followed the sugaredgame before thee.

343
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:31.100
But myself, who had theworld as my confectionary,

344
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.170
the eyes, the tongues, thehearts,

345
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.730
the mouths of men at duty,

346
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.130
more than I could frameemployment,

347
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:42.230
these that numberless uponme stuck

348
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:43.470
as leaves do on the oak,

349
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:46.000
with one winter's brushfell from their boughs

350
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.300
and left me open, bare toevery storm that blows.

351
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.030
I, to bear this, thatnever knew but better,

352
00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.230
is some burden.

353
00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:57.900
Thy nature did commence insufferance,

354
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.770
time hath made thee hardin it.

355
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.600
Why dost thou hate men?

356
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.100
They never flattered thee.

357
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.770
What hast thou given?

358
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:10.800
If thou wilt curse, thyfather, that poor rag,

359
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.970
must be thy subject,

360
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.230
who in spite put stuff tosome she beggar

361
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.530
and compounded thee poorrogue hereditary.

362
00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.030
Hence, be gone!

363
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.530
If thou hadst not beenborn the worst of men,

364
00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.170
thou hadst been a knaveand flatterer.

365
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.870
Art thou proud yet?

366
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.530
Ay, that I am not thee.

367
00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.500
I, that I was no prodigal.

368
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.900
I, that I am one now.

369
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.330
Were all the wealth I haveshut up in thee,

370
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.370
I'd give thee leave tohang it.

371
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:36.370
Get thee gone.

372
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.730
That the whole world ofAthens were in this,

373
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:44.400
thus would I eat it.

374
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.270
Here; I will mend thyfeast.

375
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.470
First, mend my company;take away thyself.

376
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.770
So I shall mend mine own,by the lack of thine.

377
00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.870
'Tis not well mended so;'tis but botched;

378
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:56.200
if 'twere not, I wouldit were.

379
00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.800
What wouldst thou have toAthens?

380
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.770
Thee thither in awhirlwind.

381
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.270
If thou wilt, tell themthere I have gold.

382
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:08.130
Look.

383
00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.370
See?

384
00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:13.700
So I have.

385
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.100
Here is no use for gold.

386
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.970
The best and truest;

387
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.830
for here it sleeps, anddoes no hired harm.

388
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.700
Where liest at nights,Timon?

389
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.700
Under that's above me.

390
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.770
Where feedest thou days,Apemantus?

391
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.830
Where my stomach findsmeat;

392
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.570
or, rather, where Ieat it.

393
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.800
Would poison were obedientand knew my mind.

394
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.030
Where wouldst thousend it?

395
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.170
To sauce thy dishes.

396
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.470
The middle of humanitythou never knewest,

397
00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:56.430
but the extremity of bothends.

398
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.730
When thou wast in thy giltand thy perfume,

399
00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.630
they mocked thee for toomuch curiosity;

400
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.900
in thy rags, thou knowestnone,

401
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.030
but art despised for thecontrary.

402
00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:11.230
There's a medlar for thee;eat it.

403
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.370
On what I hate I feed not.

404
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:14.930
Dost hate a medlar?

405
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.230
Ay, e'en though it looklike thee.

406
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.570
Hadst thou hated medlarssooner,

407
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.700
thou shouldst have lovedthyself better now.

408
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.530
What man didst thou everknow unthrift

409
00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:32.030
that was beloved after hismeans?

410
00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.770
Who, without those meansthou speaks of,

411
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.000
didst ever know beloved?

412
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Myself.

413
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.070
I understand thee;

414
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.870
thou hadst some means tokeep a dog.

415
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:48.130
What things in the world

416
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:53.500
canst thou nearest compareto thy flatterers?

417
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.300
Women nearest;

418
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.570
but men, men are thethings themselves.

419
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.100
What wouldst thou do withthe world, Apemantus,

420
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.200
if it lay in your power?

421
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.830
Give it the beasts to berid of the men.

422
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.600
Wouldst thou have thyselffall in the confusion of men

423
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.130
and live a beast with thebeasts?

424
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:19.370
Ay, Timon.

425
00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:20.630
A beastly ambition,

426
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:25.030
which the gods grant theeto attain to.

427
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:29.100
Wert thou the lion, thefox would beguile thee;

428
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:33.300
wert thou the lamb, thefox would eat thee up.

429
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.800
Wert thou the fox, thelion would suspect thee,

430
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.600
when peradventure thouwert accused by the ass.

431
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.030
Wert thou the ass, thydullness would torment thee,

432
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.200
and still thou livedst butas a breakfast to the wolf.

433
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.530
Wert thou the wolf, thygreediness should afflict thee,

434
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.430
and oft thou shouldst hazardthy life for thy dinner.

435
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:56.500
Wert thou the unicorn, prideand wrath would confound thee

436
00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.200
and make thine own selfthe conquest of thy fury.

437
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.100
Wert thou a bear, thou wouldbe killed by a horse.

438
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.600
Wert thou a horse, thou wouldstbe seized by a leopard.

439
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.300
Wert thou a leopard, thouwert germane to the lion,

440
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.970
and all the spots of thy kindredwere jurors on thy life.

441
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.870
All thy safety were remotionand thy defence absence.

442
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.130
What beast couldst thou be

443
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:20.470
that were not subject to abeast?

444
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.070
And what a beast art thoualready

445
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.370
that seest not thy loss intransformation.

446
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:30.070
If thou couldst please mewith speaking to me,

447
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.930
thou mightst have hit uponit here.

448
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:37.570
The commonwealth of Athens isbecome a forest of beasts.

449
00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.070
How has the ass broke the wallthat thou art out of the city?

450
00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:46.100
Yonder comes a poet and apainter.

451
00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:50.030
The plague of companylight upon thee.

452
00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:53.530
I will fear to catch itand give way.

453
00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.900
When I know not what else todo, I'll see thee again.

454
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.800
When there is not elseliving but thee,

455
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.130
thou shalt be welcome.

456
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:07.700
I had rather be a beggar'sdog than Apemantus.

457
00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:12.470
Thou art the cap of allthe fools alive.

458
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.100
Would thou wert cleanenough to spit upon.

459
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.170
A plague upon thee.

460
00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:16.730
Thou art too bad to curse.

461
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:18.530
All villains that do standby thee are pure.

462
00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.930
There is no leprosy butwhat thou speakest.

463
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.230
If I name thee.

464
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.170
I'll beat thee, but Ishould infect my hands.

465
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.300
I would my tongue couldrot them off.

466
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.700
Away, thou issue of amangy dog!

467
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.730
Choler does kill me thatthou art still alive;

468
00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:33.730
I swound to see thee.

469
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:35.670
Wouldst thou would burst!

470
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.630
Away, thou tedious rogue!

471
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:41.170
I am sorry I shall lose astone by thee.

472
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:42.400
Beast!

473
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.430
Slave!

474
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:44.570
Toad!

475
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:49.430
Rogue, rogue, rogue!

476
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:52.370
I am sick of this falseworld

477
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:56.230
and will love nought but eventhe mere necessities upon it.

478
00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:01.130
Then, Timon, presentlyprepare thy grave;

479
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.570
lie where the light foamof the sea

480
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.270
may beat thy grave stonedaily.

481
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.330
Make thine epitaph, thatdeath in me

482
00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.800
at other lives may laugh.

483
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:17.100
O thou sweet king killer,

484
00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.500
thou dear divorce 'twixtnatural son and sire!

485
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.700
Thou bright defiler ofHymen's purest bed!

486
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.230
Thou valiant Mars!

487
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:32.000
Thou ever young, fresh,loved and delicate wooer,

488
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.230
whose blush doth thaw theconsecrated snow

489
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.770
that lies on Dian's lap!

490
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:41.300
Thou visible god that solderestclose impossibilities,

491
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.700
and makest them kiss.

492
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.630
Thou touch of hearts.

493
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:49.700
Think, thy slave manrebels,

494
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.330
and by thy virtue set theminto confounding odds,

495
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.170
that beasts may have theworld in empire!

496
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.470
Would 'twere so!

497
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:59.000
But not till I am dead.

498
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.530
I'll say thou hast gold.

499
00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.800
Thou wilt be thronged toshortly.

500
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.270
Get back, I prithee!

501
00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.330
Live, and love thy misery.

502
00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:12.730
Long live so, and so die.

503
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:17.900
I am quit.

504
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.400
More things like men!

505
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.530
Eat, Timon, and abhorthem.

506
00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:35.670
Where should he have thisgold?

507
00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:36.730
It is some poor fragment,

508
00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.170
some slender sort of hisremainder.

509
00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:39.200
The mere want of gold,

510
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.270
and the falling-from ofhis friends,

511
00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:41.770
drove him into thismelancholy.

512
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.630
It is noised he hath amass of treasure.

513
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.000
Let us make the assayupon him.

514
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.670
If he care not for it, hewill supply us easily;

515
00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:51.270
if he covetously reserveit, how shall us get it?

516
00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.700
True; for he bears it notabout him.

517
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.500
It's hid.

518
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.170
Is not that he?

519
00:25:58.170 --> 00:25:59.170
Where?

520
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:00.930
It is his description.

521
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.700
What, he?

522
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.530
I know him.

523
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.430
Save thee, Timon.

524
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:16.770
Now, thieves?

525
00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.330
Soldiers, not thieves.

526
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:20.970
Both too;

527
00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.300
and women's sons.

528
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:26.430
We are not thieves; we aremen that much do want.

529
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:30.100
Your greatest want is, youwant much meat.

530
00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.700
Why should you want?

531
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:36.070
Behold, the earth hathroots;

532
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:40.070
within this mile breakforth a hundred springs;

533
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:46.430
the oaks bear mast, thebriers scarlet hips;

534
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.700
the bounteous housewife,nature,

535
00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.730
on each bush lays her fullmess before you.

536
00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:53.530
Want!

537
00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:54.800
Why want?

538
00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.470
We cannot live on grass,berries, water,

539
00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:01.370
as beasts, birds, andfishes.

540
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:05.630
Nor on the beasts themselves,the birds, and fishes;

541
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:09.870
you must eat men.

542
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:14.330
Yet thanks I must you con thatyou are thieves professed,

543
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.300
that you work not inholier shapes.

544
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:23.070
For there is boundless theftin limited professions.

545
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:27.770
Rascal thieves, here'sgold.

546
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.300
Go, suck the subtle bloodof the grape,

547
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.700
till the high fever seetheyour blood to froth,

548
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.130
and so 'scape hanging.

549
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.630
Trust not the physician;

550
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.470
his antidotes are poison;

551
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.770
he slays more than yourob.

552
00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:49.230
Take wealth and livestogether;

553
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:55.200
do villainy, do, since youprotest to do it, like workmen.

554
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.070
I'll example you withthievery.

555
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:02.630
The sun's a thief, and,with his great attraction,

556
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.370
robs the vast sea.

557
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.930
The moon's an arrant thief

558
00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:12.270
whose pale fire issnatched from the sun.

559
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.870
The sea's a thief, whoseliquid surge

560
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:18.630
resolves the moon intosalt tears.

561
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.900
The earth's a thief thatfeeds and breeds

562
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:26.100
from the composture stolenfrom general excrement.

563
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.630
Each thing's a thief.

564
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:32.070
The laws, your curb andwhip, in their rough power,

565
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:35.030
has unchecked theft.

566
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:37.330
Love not yourselves.

567
00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:38.570
Rob one another.

568
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.600
There's more gold.

569
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.330
Cut throats.

570
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.070
All that you meet arethieves.

571
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:49.600
To Athens go, break openshops;

572
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.070
nothing can you steal, butthieves do lose it.

573
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.600
Steal not less for this Igive you;

574
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.400
and gold confound youhowsoe'er.

575
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.930
Amen.

576
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:02.900
Has almost charmed me frommy profession

577
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.270
by persuading me to it.

578
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.500
It is in the malice of mankindthat he thus advises us;

579
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.670
not to have us thrive inour mystery.

580
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.070
I'll believe him as an enemyand give over my trade.

581
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.570
Let us first see peace inAthens.

582
00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.000
There is no time so miserablea man may be true.

583
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.170
True.

584
00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:44.570
O you gods.

585
00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:49.330
Is yond despised andruinous man my lord?

586
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.900
Full of decay and failing?

587
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.700
O monument and wonder ofgood deeds evilly disposed.

588
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:01.570
What an alteration of honorhas desperate want made.

589
00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.430
What viler thing upon theearth than friends

590
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:07.030
who can bring noblestminds to basest ends.

591
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:08.900
How rarely does it meetwith this time's guise,

592
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.970
when man was wished tolove his enemies.

593
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.570
Grant I may ever love, andrather woo

594
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:17.100
those who would mischiefme than those that do.

595
00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.870
Has caught me in his eye.

596
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:21.870
I will present my honestgrief unto him;

597
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:26.630
and, as my lord, stillserve him with my life.

598
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:28.870
My dearest master.

599
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.570
Away.

600
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:33.330
What art thou?

601
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.030
Have you forgot me, sir?

602
00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.870
I have forgot all men;

603
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.670
then, if thou grantestthou art a man,

604
00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:42.400
I have forgot thee.

605
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.330
An honest poor servant ofyours.

606
00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:48.000
Then I know thee not.

607
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.830
I never had honest menabout me, I

608
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:54.100
all I kept were knaves, toserve in meat to villains.

609
00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.330
The gods are witness,

610
00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:57.030
ne'er did poor stewardwear a truer grief

611
00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:00.370
for his undone lord thanmine eyes for you.

612
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:03.630
Why dost thou weep?

613
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:04.670
Come nearer.

614
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.670
Then I love thee, becausethou art a woman

615
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:15.330
and disclaimest flintymankind,

616
00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:21.370
whose eyes do never give butthorough lust and laughter.

617
00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:24.570
Pity's sleeping.

618
00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:26.600
Strange times that weepwith laughing,

619
00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.000
not with weeping.

620
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.600
I beg of you to know me,good my lord,

621
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.670
to accept my grief,

622
00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:32.330
and whilst this poorwealth lasts,

623
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:35.400
to entertain me as yoursteward still.

624
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:42.830
Had I a steward so true,so just,

625
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:46.470
and now so comfortable?

626
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:53.030
It almost turns mydangerous nature mild.

627
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.500
Let me behold thy face.

628
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.500
Surely, this man was bornof woman.

629
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:14.700
Forgive my general andexceptless rashness,

630
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.870
you perpetual-sober gods.

631
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:22.900
I do proclaim one honestman

632
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.870
mistake me not

633
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:29.900
but one; no more, I pray,

634
00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.370
and he's a steward.

635
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:42.930
How fain I would havehated all mankind.

636
00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:46.870
But thou redeemestthyself.

637
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:51.500
But all, save thee, I fellwith curses.

638
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:59.630
Methinks thou art morehonest now than wise;

639
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:02.700
for, by oppressing andbetraying me,

640
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:06.000
thou mightst sooner gotanother service.

641
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.930
For many so arrive atsecond masters,

642
00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:13.230
upon their first lord'sneck.

643
00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:16.330
But tell me true

644
00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:21.130
for I must ever doubt,though ne'er so sure

645
00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:30.000
is not thy kindnesssubtle, covetous, and

646
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.470
and, as rich men dealgifts,

647
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:34.370
expecting in return twentyfor one?

648
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.330
No, no, my most worthymaster;

649
00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:38.170
in whose breast doubt andsuspect, alas,

650
00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:39.630
are placed too late.

651
00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:42.000
You should have feared falsetimes when you did feast.

652
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.300
Suspect still comes wherean estate is least.

653
00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.700
That which I show, heavenknows,

654
00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.230
is merely love, duty and zealto your unmatched mind,

655
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:50.800
care of your food andliving;

656
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.330
and, believe it, my mosthonored lord,

657
00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.870
for any benefit that comesto me,

658
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:57.270
either in hope or present, I'dexchange for this one wish,

659
00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:59.430
that you had power andwealth to requite me

660
00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:01.800
by making rich yourself.

661
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:06.730
Why, look thee, 'tis so.

662
00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:09.470
Thou singly honest man,

663
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:13.900
the gods out of my miseryhave sent thee treasure.

664
00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:18.130
Go, live rich and happy;

665
00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:21.270
but thus conditioned:

666
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:24.030
thou shalt build from men;

667
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:28.730
hate all, curse all, showcharity to none,

668
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:30.930
but let the famished fleshslide from the bone,

669
00:34:30.930 --> 00:34:32.400
ere thou relieve thebeggar;

670
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.330
give to dogs what thoudeniest to men;

671
00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:40.870
let prisons swallow 'em up,debts wither 'em to nothing;

672
00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:43.130
be men like blasted woods,

673
00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:45.530
and diseases lick theirfalse bloods.

674
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.800
So, so farewell and thrive.

675
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.630
Oh, let me stay andcomfort you, my master.

676
00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:54.030
Fly, whilst thou art blestand free!

677
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.530
Ne'er see thou man, andlet me ne'er see thee.
