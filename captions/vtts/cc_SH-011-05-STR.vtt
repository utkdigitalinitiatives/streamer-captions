00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.830


2
00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.470


3
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.570
and therefore make her gravestraight:

4
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.530
the crowner hath sat on her, andfinds it Christian burial.

5
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.070
How can that be,

6
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.130
unless she drowned herself inher own defense?

7
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.730
Why, 'tis found so.

8
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.000
It must be "se offendendo;" itcannot be else.

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.330
For here lies the point:

10
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.370
if I drown myself wittingly, itargues an act:

11
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.300
and an act hath three branches.

12
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.970
It is to act, to do, to perform.

13
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.300
Argal, she drowned herselfwittingly.

14
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.870
Nay, but hear you, goodmandelver.

15
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.130
Give me leave.

16
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.900
Here lies the water; good: herestands the man; good;

17
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.070
if the man go to this water anddrown himself,

18
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.000
it is, will he, nill he, hegoes,--mark you that;

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.930
but if the water come to him anddrown him,

20
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.670
he drowns not himself.

21
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.600
Argal, he that is not guilty ofhis own death

22
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.930
shortens not his own life.

23
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.170
But is this law?

24
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.570
Ay, marry, is't; crowner's questlaw.

25
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.100
Will you ha' the truth on't?

26
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.800
If this had not been agentlewoman,

27
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.130
she should have been buried outo' Christian burial.

28
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.370
Why, there thou say'st:

29
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.970
and the more pity that greatfolk

30
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.700
should have countenance in thisworld

31
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.230
to drown or hang themselves,more than their even Christian.

32
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.300
Come, my spade.

33
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.930
There is no ancient gentlemanbut gardeners,

34
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.000
ditchers, and grave-makers: theyhold up Adam's profession.

35
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.400
Was he a gentleman?

36
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.530
He was the first ever bore arms.

37
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.000
Why, he had none.

38
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.230
What, art a heathen?

39
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.470
How dost thou understand theScripture?

40
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.670
The Scripture says, "Adamdigged."

41
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.300
Could he dig without arms?

42
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.900
I'll put another question tothee:

43
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.570
if thou answerest me not to thepurpose,

44
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.670
confess thyself.

45
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.200
Go to.

46
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.400
What is he that builds stronger

47
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.700
than either the mason, theshipwright, or the carpenter?

48
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.800
The gallows-maker;

49
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.500
for that frame outlives athousand tenants.

50
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.730
I like thy wit well, in goodfaith:

51
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.600
the gallows does well; but howdoes it do well?

52
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.570
It does well to those that doill.

53
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.000
Now thou dost ill to say thegallows is built stronger

54
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.170
than the church: argal, thegallows may do well to thee.

55
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.330
To't again, come.

56
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.470
"Who builds stronger than amason, a shipwright,

57
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.570
or a carpenter?"

58
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.670
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.

59
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.770
Marry, now I can tell.

60
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.070
To't.

61
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.570
Mass, I cannot tell.

62
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.570
Cudgel thy brains no more aboutit,

63
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.300
for your dull ass will not mendhis pace with beating;

64
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.770
and, when you are asked thisquestion next, say,

65
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.400
"a grave-maker: the houses thathe makes last"--

66
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.100
Until doomsday."

67
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.600
Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetchme a stoup of liquor.

68
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.600
In youth, when I did love, didlove,

69
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.770
Methought it were very sweet, Tocontract,

70
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.900
O, the time, for, ah, my behove,

71
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.170
methought there was nothingmeet.

72
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.470
Has this fellow no feeling ofhis business

73
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.730
that he sings at grave-making?

74
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.400
Custom hath made it in him aproperty of easiness.

75
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.770
'Tis e'en so:

76
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.800
the hand of little employmenthath the daintier sense.

77
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.770
But age, with his stealing step,

78
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.200
Hath claw'd me in his clutch,

79
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.930
And shipped me into the land,

80
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.130
As if I had never been such.

81
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.600
That skull had a tongue in itand could sing once.

82
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.270
How the knave jowls it to theground

83
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.630
as if it were Cain's jaw-bonethat did the first murder!

84
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.630
This might be the pate of apolitician,

85
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.130
which this ass now o'er-reaches;

86
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.100
one that would circumvent God,might it not?

87
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.570
It might, my lord.

88
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.130
Or of a courtier;

89
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.700
which could say, "Good morrow,sweet lord!

90
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.630
How dost thou, sweet lord?"

91
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.700
This might be my lordsuch-a-one,

92
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.570
that praised my lordsuch-a-one's horse,

93
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.200
when he meant to beg it; mightit not?

94
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.130
Ay, my lord.

95
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.900
Why, e'en so: and now my LadyWorm's;

96
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.070
chapless, and knocked about themazzard with a sexton's spade.

97
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.470
Here's fine revolution, an' wehad the trick to see't.

98
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.930
A spade, For and a shroudingsheet:

99
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:16.030
O, a pit of clay for to be madeFor such a guest is meet.

100
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.130
There's another: why may notthat be the skull of a lawyer?

101
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.970
Why does he suffer this rudeknave now

102
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.830
to knock him about the sconcewith a dirty shovel,

103
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.870
and will not tell him of hisaction of battery?

104
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.400
Hmm?

105
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.030
I will speak to this fellow.

106
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.070
Whose grave's this, sirrah?

107
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.970
Mine, sir.

108
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.500
O, a pit of clay for to be madeFor such a guest is meet.

109
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.100
Indeed I think it be thine; thouliest in't.

110
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.400
You lie out on't, sir, andtherefore it's not yours:

111
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.630
for my part, I do not lie in't,and yet it is mine.

112
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.830
Thou dost lie in't, to be in'tand say it is thine:

113
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.430
'tis for the dead, not for thequick;

114
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.600
therefore thou liest.

115
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.700
'Tis a quick lie, sir;

116
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.070
'twill away gain, from me toyou.

117
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.030
What man dost thou dig it for?

118
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.200
For no man, sir.

119
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.300
What woman, then?

120
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.570
None, neither.

121
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.970
Who is to be buried in't?

122
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.500
One that was a woman, sir; but,rest her soul, she's dead.

123
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.470
Absolute the knave is!

124
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.870
We must speak by the card orequivocation will undo us.

125
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.070
How long hast thou been agrave-maker?

126
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.570
Of all the days i' the year,

127
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.630
I came to't that day that ourlast king Hamlet

128
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.300
overcame Fortinbras.

129
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.970
How long is that since?

130
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.470
Cannot you tell that?

131
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.430
Every fool can tell that:

132
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.000
it was the very day that youngHamlet was born;

133
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.700
he that is mad and sent intoEngland.

134
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.630
Ay, marry, why was he sent intoEngland?

135
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.870
Why, because he was mad: heshall recover his wits there;

136
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.570
or, if he do not, it's no greatmatter there.

137
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.830
Why?

138
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.300
'Twill a not be seen in himthere;

139
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.730
there the men are as mad as he.

140
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.530
How came he mad?

141
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.800
Very strangely, they say.

142
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.270
How strangely?

143
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.900
Faith, e'en with losing hiswits.

144
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.170
Upon what ground?

145
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.030
Why, here in Denmark:

146
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:17.500
I have been sexton here, man andboy, thirty years.

147
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.400
How long will a man lie i' theearth ere he rot?

148
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.600
I' faith, if he be not rottenbefore he die--

149
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.800
as we have many pocky corsesnow-a-days,

150
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.930
will scarce hold the laying in.

151
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.400
He'll last you some eight yearor nine year.

152
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.670
A tanner will last you nineyear.

153
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.370
Why he more than another?

154
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.670
Why, sir, his hide is so tannedwith his trade

155
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.270
that it will keep out water agreat while;

156
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:51.000
and your water is a sore decayerof your whoreson dead body.

157
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.230
Here's a skull now;

158
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.000
lain in the earth three andtwenty years.

159
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.300
Whose was it?

160
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.230
A whoreson mad fellow's it was:

161
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.170
whose do you think it was?

162
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.170
Nay, I know not.

163
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.170
A pestilence on him for a madrogue!

164
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.800
Poured a flagon of Rhenish on myhead once.

165
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.170
This same skull, sir, was, sir,Yorick's skull,

166
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.400
the king's jester.

167
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.500
This?

168
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.100
E'en that.

169
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.970
Let me see.

170
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.230
Alas, poor Yorick!

171
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.170
I knew him, Horatio:

172
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:41.130
a fellow of infinite jest, ofmost excellent fancy:

173
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:47.970
he hath borne me on his back athousand times;

174
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.900
and now, how abhorred in myimagination it is!

175
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.670
My gorge rises at it.

176
00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:00.570
Here hung those lips that I havekissed I know not how oft.

177
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.200
Where be your gibes now?

178
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.330
Your gambols?

179
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.430
Your songs?

180
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.970
Your flashes of merriment,

181
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.270
that were wont to set the tableon a roar?

182
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.500
Not one now, to mock your owngrinning?

183
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.230
Quite chap-fallen?

184
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.500
Now get you to my lady'schamber,

185
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.830
and tell her, let her paint aninch thick,

186
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:34.730
to this favour she must come;make her laugh at that.

187
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.730
Prithee, Horatio, tell me onething.

188
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.930
What's that, my lord?

189
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:50.170
Dost thou think Alexander lookedo' this fashion i' the earth?

190
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.200
E'en so, my lord.

191
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.000
And smelt so?

192
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.370
Pah!

193
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.400
E'en so.

194
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.430
To what base uses we may return,Horatio!

195
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.400
Why may not imagination tracethe noble dust of Alexander,

196
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.370
till he find it stopping abung-hole?

197
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.530
'Twere to consider too curiouslyto consider so.

198
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.570
No, faith, not a jot as thus:

199
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.530
Alexander died, Alexander wasburied,

200
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.000
Alexander returneth into dust;

201
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.870
the dust is earth; of earth wemake loam;

202
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.930
and why of that loam, whereto hewas converted,

203
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:30.370
might they not stop abeer-barrel?

204
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:36.100
Imperious Caesar, dead andturn'd to clay,

205
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.870
Might stop a hole to keep thewind away:

206
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.670
O, that that earth, which keptthe world in awe,

207
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:51.130
Should patch a wall to expel thewinter's flaw!

208
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.770
Soft!

209
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.000
Soft awhile!

210
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.200
Here comes the king, the queen,the courtiers.

211
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.300
Who is this they follow?

212
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.730
And with such maimed rites?

213
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.500
This doth betoken The corse theyfollow

214
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.500
did with desperate hand Fordo itown life:

215
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.370
'twas of some estate.

216
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.100
Couch we awhile, and mark.

217
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.030
What ceremony else?

218
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:55.070
That is Laertes, A very nobleyouth: mark.

219
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.200
What ceremony else?

220
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.800
Her obsequies have been as farenlarged As we have warrantise:

221
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.930
her death was doubtful;

222
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.770
And, but that great commando'ersways the order,

223
00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.330
She should in groundunsanctified have lodged

224
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
Till the last trumpet:

225
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.830
for charitable prayers, Shards,flints and pebbles

226
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.500
should be thrown on her;

227
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.030
Yet here she is allow'd hervirgin crants,

228
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.500
Her maiden strewments

229
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.270
and the bringing home Of belland burial.

230
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.230
Must there no more be done?

231
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.100
No more be done:

232
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:30.230
We should profane the service ofthe dead To sing such requiem

233
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.230
and such rest to her As topeace-parted souls.

234
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.870
Lay her i' the earth.

235
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.300
And from her fair and unpollutedflesh

236
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.570
May violets spring!

237
00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:49.870
I tell thee, churlish priest,

238
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.100
A ministering angel shall mysister be,

239
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.370
When thou liest howling.

240
00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.070
What, the fair Ophelia!

241
00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:04.570
Sweets to the sweet: farewell!

242
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.700
I hoped thou wouldst have beenmy Hamlet's wife;

243
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.770
I thought thy bride-bed to havedeck'd, sweet maid,

244
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.130
And not have strew'd thy grave.

245
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.330
O, treble woe Fall ten timestreble on that cursed head,

246
00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:24.470
Whose wicked deed

247
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.230
thy most ingenious senseDeprived thee of!

248
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.770
Hold off the earth awhile,

249
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.300
Till I have caught her once morein mine arms:

250
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:55.130
Now pile your dust upon thequick and dead,

251
00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.030
Till of this flat a mountain youhave made,

252
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.770
To o'ertop old Pelion,

253
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.600
or the skyish head Of blueOlympus.

254
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.130
What is he whose grief Bearssuch an emphasis?

255
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.700
Whose phrase of sorrow Conjuresthe wandering stars

256
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.370
and makes them stand Likewonder-wounded hearers?

257
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.670
This is I, Hamlet the Dane.

258
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.670
The devil take thy soul!

259
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.000
Thou pray'st not well.

260
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.830
I prithee, take thy fingers frommy throat;

261
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:23.930
Pluck them asunder.

262
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.630
Hamlet, Hamlet!

263
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.930
Be quiet!

264
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.700
I will fight with him upon thistheme

265
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.330
Until my eyelids will no longerwag.

266
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.130
O my son, what theme?

267
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.830
I loved Ophelia!

268
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.870
Forty thousand brothers Couldnot,

269
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.330
with all their quantity of love,Make up my sum.

270
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.730
What wilt thou do for her?

271
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.500
O, he's mad, Laertes.

272
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.770
For love of God, forbear him.

273
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.870
'Swounds, show me what thou'ltdo: Woo't weep?

274
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.130
Woo't fight?

275
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:50.230
Woo't fast?

276
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.370
Woo't tear thyself?

277
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.470
Woo't drink up eisel?

278
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.000
Eat a crocodile?

279
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.400
I'll do't.

280
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.430
Dost thou come here to whine?

281
00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:01.870
To outface me with leaping inher grave?

282
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.470
Be buried quick with her, and sowill I:

283
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.570
And, if thou prate of mountains,

284
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.030
let them throw Millions of acreson us,

285
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.130
till our ground, Singeing hispate against the burning zone,

286
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.300
Make Ossa like a wart!

287
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:24.100
Nay, an thou'lt mouth, I'll rantas well as thou.

288
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.670
This is mere madness:

289
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.000
And thus awhile the fit willwork on him;

290
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.730
Anon, as patient as the femaledove,

291
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.800
When that her golden coupletsare disclosed,

292
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.870
His silence will sit drooping.

293
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.300
Hear you, sir;

294
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.530
What is the reason that you useme thus?

295
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:46.830
I loved you ever: but it is nomatter;

296
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:51.470
Let Hercules himself do what hemay,

297
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:58.130
The cat will mew and dog willhave his day.

298
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.200
I pray you, good Horatio, waiton him.

299
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.900
Strengthen your patience in ourlast night's speech;

300
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.970
We'll put the matter to thepresent push.

301
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.830
Good Gertrude, set some watchover your son.

302
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:25.100
This grave shall have a livingmonument:

303
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.370
An hour of quiet shortly shallwe see;

304
00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.800
Till then, in patience ourproceedings be.

305
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:36.630
So much for this, sir: now shallyou see the other;

306
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.400
You do remember all thecircumstance?

307
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.900
Remember it, my lord?

308
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.930
Sir, in my heart there was akind of fighting

309
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.170
That would not let me sleep:

310
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.770
methought I lay Worse than themutines in the bilboes.

311
00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:52.130
Rashly, And praised be rashnessfor it, let us know,

312
00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:54.370
Our indiscretion sometimesserves us well

313
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:59.470
When our deep plots do pall: andthat should learn us

314
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.830
There's a divinity that shapesour ends,

315
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.270
Rough-hew them how we will.

316
00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.170
That is most certain.

317
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.030
Up from my cabin, My sea-gownscarf'd about me,

318
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.470
in the dark Groped I to find outthem; had my desire.

319
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.670
Finger'd their packet,

320
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.000
and in fine withdrew To mine ownroom again;

321
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.300
making so bold, My fearsforgetting manners,

322
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.770
to unseal Their grandcommission;

323
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:23.330
where I found, Horatio,-- Oroyal knavery!--

324
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.730
an exact command,

325
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.700
Larded with many several sortsof reasons

326
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:30.600
Importing Denmark's health andEngland's too,

327
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.000
With, ho!

328
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.430
Such bugs and goblins in mylife,

329
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.330
That, on the supervise, noleisure bated,

330
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.070
No, not to stay the grinding ofthe axe,

331
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.230
My head should be struck off.

332
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.700
Is't possible?

333
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.230
Here's the commission: read itat more leisure.

334
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.000
But wilt thou hear me how I didproceed?

335
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.270
I do beseech you.

336
00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.430
Being thus be-netted round withvillanies,--

337
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:55.730
I sat me down, Devised a newcommission, wrote it fair:

338
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.070
I once did hold it, as ourstatists do,

339
00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.970
A baseness to write fair andlabour'd much

340
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.300
How to forget that learning,

341
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.600
but, sir, now It did me yeoman'sservice:

342
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.430
wilt thou know The effect ofwhat I wrote?

343
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:07.570
Ay, good my lord.

344
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:09.830
An earnest conjuration from theking,

345
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:13.070
As England was his faithfultributary,

346
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:17.570
As love between them like thepalm might flourish,

347
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:20.700
As peace should still herwheaten garland wear

348
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.000
And stand a comma 'tween theiramities,

349
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.670
And many such-like 'As'es ofgreat charge,

350
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.900
That, on the view and knowing ofthese contents,

351
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.070
Without debatement further, moreor less,

352
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.770
He should those bearers put tosudden death,

353
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:40.170
Not shriving-time allow'd.

354
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.000
How was this seal'd?

355
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.230
Why, even in that was heavenordinant.

356
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.500
I had my father's signet in mypurse,

357
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.930
Which was the model of thatDanish seal.

358
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:55.400
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantzgo to't.

359
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.970
Why, man, they did make love tothis employment;

360
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.900
They are not near my conscience;

361
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.700
their defeat Does by their owninsinuation grow:

362
00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.700
'Tis dangerous when the basernature

363
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.530
comes Between the pass and fellincensed points

364
00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.130
Of mighty opposites.

365
00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:16.600
Why, what a king is this!

366
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.070
Does it not, think thee, standme now upon--

367
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:23.270
He that hath kill'd my king,whored my mother,

368
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.200
Popp'd in between the electionand my hopes,

369
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.970
Thrown out his angle for myproper life,

370
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.330
And with such cozenage--

371
00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.370
is't not perfect conscience, Toquit him with this arm?

372
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.170
and is't not to be damn'd,

373
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.900
To let this canker of our nature

374
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.430
come In further evil?

375
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.270
It must be shortly known to himfrom England

376
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.100
What is the issue of thebusiness there.

377
00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:58.270
It will be short: the interim ismine;

378
00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.300
And a man's life's no more thanto say, "One."

379
00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.070
But I am very sorry, goodHoratio,

380
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.000
That to Laertes I forgot myself;

381
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.670
For, by the image of my cause, Isee The portraiture of his:

382
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.870
I'll court his favours.

383
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.700
But, sure, the bravery of hisgrief

384
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.770
did put me Into a toweringpassion.

385
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.870
Peace!

386
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.530
Who comes here?

387
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.730
Your lordship is right welcomeback to Denmark.

388
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.600
I humbly thank you, sir.

389
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.800
Dost know this water-fly?

390
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.200
No, good my lord.

391
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.700
Thy state is the more gracious;for 'tis a vice to know him.

392
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.730
He hath much land, and fertile.

393
00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.230
'Tis a chough; but, as I say,

394
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.870
spacious in the possession ofdirt.

395
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:40.070
Sweet lord, if your lordshipwere at leisure,

396
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.000
I should impart a thing to youfrom his majesty.

397
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.500
I shall receive it, sir, withall diligence of spirit.

398
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.570
Put your bonnet to his rightuse;

399
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.570
'tis for the head.

400
00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.530
I thank your lordship. It isvery hot.

401
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:57.300
No, believe me, it's very cold;the wind is northerly.

402
00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.200
It is indifferent cold, my lord,indeed.

403
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.670
And yet methinks it is verysultry and hot

404
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:05.000
for my complexion.

405
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.770
Exceedingly, my lord; it is verysultry,--

406
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:13.670
as 'twere,-- I cannot tell how.

407
00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:17.400
But, my lord, his majesty bademe signify to you

408
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.200
that he has laid a great wageron your head:

409
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.430
sir, this is the matter,--

410
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.200
I beseech you, sir, remember--

411
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:30.070
Nay, good my lord; for my ease,in good faith.

412
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:36.530
Sir, here is newly come to courtLaertes;

413
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.300
believe me, an absolutegentleman,

414
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.100
full of most excellentdifferences,

415
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.870
of very soft society and greatshowing:

416
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.300
indeed, to speak feelingly ofhim,

417
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.170
he is the card or calendar ofgentry,

418
00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:50.900
for you shall find in him thecontinent

419
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.830
of what part a gentleman wouldsee.

420
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:57.370
Sir, his definement suffers noperdition in you;

421
00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.500
though, I know, to divide himinventorially

422
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.300
would dizzy the arithmetic ofmemory,

423
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.230
and yet but yaw neither, inrespect of his quick sail.

424
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.230
But, in the verity of extolment,

425
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.530
I take him to be a soul of greatarticle;

426
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.670
and his infusion of such dearthand rareness,

427
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:17.470
as, to make true diction of him,his semblable is his mirror;

428
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.370
and who else would trace him,his umbrage, nothing more.

429
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:24.730
O, Your lordship speaks mostinfallibly of him.

430
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.400
The concernancy, sir?

431
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.700
Why do we wrap the gentleman inour more rawer breath?

432
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.570
Sir?

433
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:36.500
Is't not possible to understandin another tongue?

434
00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.770
You will do't, sir, really.

435
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.430
What imports the nomination ofthis gentleman?

436
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.830
Of Laertes?

437
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:47.900
His purse is empty already; allhis golden words are spent.

438
00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.370
Of him, sir.

439
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:50.570
I know you are not ignorant.

440
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.070
I would you did;

441
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:54.670
and yet, in faith, if you did,it would not much approve me.

442
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.000
Well, sir?

443
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.570
You are not ignorant of whatexcellence Laertes is.

444
00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.900
I dare not confess that,

445
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.030
lest I should compare with himin excellence;

446
00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:08.170
but, to know a man well were toknow himself.

447
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.200
I mean, sir, for his weapon;

448
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.200
but in the imputation laid onhim by them,

449
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.530
in his meed he's unfellowed.

450
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.800
What's his weapon?

451
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.400
Rapier and dagger.

452
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.630
That's two of his weapons: but,well.

453
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.830
The king, sir, hath laid, sir,

454
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.970
that in a dozen passes betweenyourself and him,

455
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.330
he shall not exceed you threehits:

456
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:32.830
he hath laid on twelve for nine;

457
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:34.500
and it would come to immediatetrial,

458
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.730
if your lordship would vouchsafethe answer.

459
00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.400
How if I answer "no"?

460
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:50.070
I mean, my lord, the oppositionof your person in trial.

461
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.200
Sir, I will walk here in thehall:

462
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.870
if it please his majesty,

463
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.200
'tis the breathing time of daywith me;

464
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.030
let the foils be brought, thegentleman willing,

465
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:05.770
and the king hold his purpose, Iwill win for him an' I can;

466
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:11.600
if not, I will gain nothing butmy shame and the odd hits.

467
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.970
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?

468
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.770
To this effect.

469
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:19.870
After what flourish your naturewill.

470
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.400
I commend my duty to yourlordship.

471
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.930
Yours, yours.

472
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.300
He does well to commend ithimself;

473
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:44.930
there are no tongues else for'sturn.

474
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:49.000
This lapwing runs away with theshell on his head.

475
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.430
He did comply so with his dugbefore he sucked it.

476
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.000
You will lose this wager, mylord.

477
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.370
I do not think so: since he wentinto France,

478
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.700
I have been in continualpractice:

479
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.730
I shall win at the odds.

480
00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:07.500
But thou wouldst not think howill all's here about my heart:

481
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.700
but it is no matter.

482
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.030
Nay, good my lord.

483
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.070
It is but foolery.

484
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.930
But yet it is such a kind ofgain-giving

485
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.570
as would perhaps trouble awoman.

486
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:22.670
If your mind dislike any thing,obey it:

487
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.170
I will forestall their repairhither

488
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.330
and say you are not fit.

489
00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:28.000
Not a whit, we defy augury.

490
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:32.470
There's a special providence inthe fall of a sparrow.

491
00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:38.130
If it be now, 'tis not to come;

492
00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:42.070
if it be not to come, it will benow;

493
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:48.900
if it be not now, yet it willcome:

494
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.330
the readiness is all.

495
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.200
Let be.

496
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.270
Come, Hamlet, come, and takethis hand from me.

497
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.800
Give me your pardon, sir: I havedone you wrong;

498
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.430
But pardon't, as you are agentleman.

499
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:08.700
This presence knows, And youmust needs have heard,

500
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.270
how I am punish'd With a soredistraction.

501
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:12.670
What I have done,

502
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.630
That might your nature, honour,and exception Roughly awake,

503
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:20.730
I here proclaim was madness.

504
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:22.470
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes?

505
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.570
Never Hamlet: If Hamlet fromhimself be ta'en away,

506
00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:28.870
And when he's not himself doeswrong Laertes,

507
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:31.470
Hamlet does it not; Hamletdenies it.

508
00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.200
Who does it, then?

509
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.670
His madness: if't be so,

510
00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:38.000
Hamlet is of the faction that iswrong'd;

511
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.530
His madness is poor Hamlet'senemy.

512
00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:41.900
Sir, in this audience,

513
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.470
Let my disclaiming from apurposed evil

514
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.900
Free me so far in your mostgenerous thoughts,

515
00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:51.230
That I have shot mine arrow o'erthe house,

516
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.470
And hurt my brother.

517
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.900
I am satisfied in nature, Whosemotive, in this case,

518
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.930
should stir me most To myrevenge:

519
00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:01.070
but in my terms of honour Istand aloof;

520
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:04.000
and will no reconcilement,

521
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.270
Till by some elder masters, ofknown honour,

522
00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.100
I have a voice and precedent ofpeace,

523
00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.070
To keep my name ungored.

524
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:14.400
But till that time, I do receiveyour offer'd love like love,

525
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.670
And will not wrong it.

526
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.030
I embrace it freely;

527
00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.630
And will this brother's wagerfrankly play.

528
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:21.730
Give us the foils.

529
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:22.830
Come on.

530
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.330
Come, one for me.

531
00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:26.100
I'll be your foil, Laertes:

532
00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.770
in mine ignorance Your skillshall,

533
00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:29.430
like a star i' the darkestnight,

534
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:31.030
Stick fiery off indeed.

535
00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:32.200
You mock me, sir.

536
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.800
No, by this hand.

537
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.100
Give them the foils, youngOsric.

538
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.770
Hamlet, You know the wager?

539
00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:40.100
Very well, my lord.

540
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.770
Your grace hath laid the odds o'the weaker side.

541
00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:45.300
I do not fear it; I have seenyou both:

542
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.870
But since he is better'd, wehave therefore odds.

543
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:49.530
This is too heavy. Let me seeanother.

544
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.730
This likes me well.

545
00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.300
These foils have all a length?

546
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.300
Ay, my good lord.

547
00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:01.070
Set me the stoops of wine uponthat table.

548
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.570
If Hamlet make the first orsecond hit

549
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.400
Or quit in answer of the thirdexchanges,

550
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.430
Let all the battlements theirordnance fire:

551
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:12.130
The king shall drink to Hamlet'sbetter breath;

552
00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:16.130
And in the cup an union shall hethrow,

553
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.270
Richer than that which foursuccessive kings

554
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.730
In Denmark's crown have worn.

555
00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:23.100
Give me the cup;

556
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.170
And let the kettle to thetrumpet speak,

557
00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.700
The trumpet to the cannoneerwithout,

558
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.370
The cannons to the heavens, theheaven to earth,

559
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:38.300
"Now the king drinks to Hamlet."

560
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.970
Come, begin: And you, thejudges, bear a wary eye.

561
00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:57.630
Come on, sir.

562
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.970
Come, my lord.

563
00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:07.270
One.

564
00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.370
No.

565
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:09.670
Judgment.

566
00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:11.200
A hit, a very palpable hit.

567
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.170
Well; again.

568
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:15.730
Stay; give me drink.

569
00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:23.130
Hamlet, this pearl is thine;Here's to thy health.

570
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:32.230
Give him the cup.

571
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:35.000
I'll play this bout first; setit by awhile.

572
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.430
Come.

573
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.930
Another hit. What say you?

574
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:21.070
A touch, a touch, I do confess.

575
00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:23.670
Our son shall win.

576
00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:24.970
He's fat, and scant of breath.

577
00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:30.430
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin,rub thy brows;

578
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:32.500
The queen carouses to thyfortune, Hamlet.

579
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.670
Good madam!

580
00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:36.700
Gertrude, do not drink.

581
00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.870
I will, my lord; I pray you,pardon me.

582
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:46.400
It is the poison'd cup: it istoo late.

583
00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.570
I dare not drink yet, madam; byand by.

584
00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:52.500
Come, let me wipe thy face.

585
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.530
My lord, I'll hit him now.

586
00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:56.670
I do not think't.

587
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.170
And yet it is almost against myconscience.

588
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:04.730
Come, for the third, Laertes.

589
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:08.570
You but dally; I pray you, passwith your best violence;

590
00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:11.930
I am afeard you make a wanton ofme.

591
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.670
Say you so?

592
00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:16.030
Come on.

593
00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:34.130
Nothing, neither way.

594
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.830
Have at you now!

595
00:30:58.670 --> 00:30:59.970
Part them; they're incensed.

596
00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.500
Nay, come, again.

597
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.770
Look to the queen there, ho!

598
00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:22.870
They bleed on both sides.

599
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:23.970
How is it, my lord?

600
00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:25.370
How is't, Laertes?

601
00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.500
Why, as a woodcock to mine ownspringe, Osric;

602
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.930
I am justly kill'd with mine owntreachery.

603
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:33.030
How does the queen?

604
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:35.600
She swounds to see them bleed.

605
00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:41.900
No, no, the drink, the drink,--Omy dear Hamlet,--

606
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.800
The drink, the drink!

607
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:49.170
I am poison'd.

608
00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:50.830
O villany!

609
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:51.930
Ho!

610
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:53.830
Let the doors be lock'd:Treachery!

611
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:54.930
Seek it out.

612
00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:57.230
It is here, Hamlet:

613
00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:01.130
Hamlet, thou art slain;

614
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:03.900
No medicine in the world can dothee good;

615
00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.170
In thee there is not half anhour's life;

616
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:10.070
The treacherous instrument is inthy hand,

617
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:13.000
Unbated and envenom'd.

618
00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:21.670
The foul practice Hath turn'ditself on me.

619
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:26.500
Lo, here I lie, Never to riseagain:

620
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:33.200
thy mother's poison'd: I can nomore.

621
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:38.170
The king, the king's to blame.

622
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:41.500
The point!--envenom'd too!

623
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:47.130
Then, venom, to thy work.

624
00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.400
Treason!

625
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.870
Treason!

626
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:55.730
O, yet defend me, friends; I ambut hurt.

627
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:59.230
Here, thou incestuous,murderous, damned Dane,

628
00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:00.900
Drink off this potion.

629
00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.770
Is thy union here?

630
00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:05.330
Follow my mother.

631
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.400
He is justly served;

632
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.970
It is a poison temper'd by him--

633
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:19.530
Exchange forgiveness with me,noble Hamlet:

634
00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:22.570
Mine and my father's death comenot on thee,

635
00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:25.000
Nor thine on me.

636
00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:30.600
Heaven make thee free of it!

637
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.400
I follow thee.

638
00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.330
I am dead, Horatio.

639
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:40.100
Wretched queen, adieu!

640
00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:47.570
You that look pale and trembleat this chance

641
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:51.430
That are but mutes or audienceto this act,

642
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:55.170
Had I but time-- as this fellsergeant, death,

643
00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:59.330
Is strict in his arrest-- Icould tell you--

644
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:02.230
But let it be.

645
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:09.300
Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest;

646
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:13.070
report me and my cause aright Tothe unsatisfied.

647
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:17.170
Never believe it: I am more anantique Roman than a Dane:

648
00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:18.430
Here's yet some liquor left.

649
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:20.270
As thou'rt a man, Give me thecup.

650
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:21.530
Let go; by heaven.

651
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.300
O God Horatio,

652
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.030
If thou didst ever hold me inthy heart

653
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.600
Absent thee from felicityawhile,

654
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.870
And in this harsh world draw thybreath in pain,

655
00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:34.670
To tell my story.

656
00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:39.600
What warlike noise is this?

657
00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.900
Young Fortinbras, with conquestcome from Poland,

658
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.500
To the ambassadors of Englandgives This warlike volley.

659
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:48.600
O, I die, Horatio;

660
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:52.130
The potent poison quiteo'er-crows my spirit:

661
00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:56.130
I cannot live to hear the newsfrom England;

662
00:34:56.130 --> 00:35:01.870
But I do prophesy the electionlights On Fortinbras:

663
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:06.170
he has my dying voice;

664
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:10.530
So tell him, with theoccurrents,

665
00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:15.900
more and less, Which havesolicited.

666
00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.430
The rest is silence.

667
00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.770
Now cracks a noble heart.

668
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:49.500
Good night, sweet prince.

669
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.900
And flights of angels sing theeto thy rest!

670
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.130
Why does the drum come hither?

671
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.570
Where is this sight?

672
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:11.100
What is it ye would see?

673
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.730
If aught of woe or wonder, ceaseyour search.

674
00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:19.970
This quarry cries on havoc.

675
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:23.900
O proud death,

676
00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.070
What feast is toward in thineeternal cell,

677
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.630
That thou so many princes at ashot

678
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:31.300
So bloodily hast struck?

679
00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.000
The sight is dismal;

680
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.870
And our affairs from Englandcome too late:

681
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:41.230
The ears are senseless thatshould give us hearing,

682
00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:44.070
To tell him his commandment isfulfill'd,

683
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:48.830
That Rosencrantz andGuildenstern are dead:

684
00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.930
Where should we have our thanks?

685
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:53.500
Not from his mouth,

686
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.170
Had it the ability of life tothank you:

687
00:36:56.170 --> 00:37:00.630
He never gave commandment fortheir deaths.

688
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:04.430
But since, so jump upon thisbloody question,

689
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:06.770
You from the Polack wars, andyou from England,

690
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:10.170
Are here arrived give ordersthat these bodies

691
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:13.370
High on a stage be placed to theview;

692
00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:16.100
And let me speak to the yetunknowing world

693
00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.930
How these things came about:

694
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:23.600
so shall you hear Of carnal,bloody, and unnatural acts,

695
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.670
Of accidental judgments, casualslaughters,

696
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:31.900
Of deaths put on by cunning andforced cause,

697
00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.400
And, in this upshot,

698
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:40.270
purposes mistook Fall'n on theinventors' heads:

699
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:41.770
all this can I Truly deliver.

700
00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.670
Let us haste to hear it.

701
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.170
Call the noblest to theaudience.

702
00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:53.570
For me, with sorrow I embrace myfortune:

703
00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:56.830
I have some rights of memory inthis kingdom,

704
00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.870
Which now to claim my vantagedoth invite me.

705
00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:04.000
That I shall have also cause tospeak,

706
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.600
And from his mouth whose voicewill draw on more.

707
00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.530
Let this same be presentlyperform'd,

708
00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:14.430
Even while men's minds are wild;

709
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:16.730
lest more mischance On plots anderrors, happen.

710
00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:24.330
Let four captains Bear Hamlet,like a soldier, to the stage;

711
00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:26.070
For he was likely, had he beenput on,

712
00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.570
To have proved most royal.

713
00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:34.270
And for his passage,

714
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:38.870
The soldiers' music and therites of war

715
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:40.770
Speak loudly for him.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.370
Take up the bodies.

717
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:55.630
Such a sight as this Becomes thefield,

718
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.430
but here shows much amiss.

719
00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.370
